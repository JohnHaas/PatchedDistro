At the end of his service in 1933, he joined the SS and met Wilhelm Bittrich and Hermann Prieß. According to his personnel file, he joined his service on 1 January 1934 and on 17 June 1934 was appointed adjutant of the 74th SS-Standarte. In 1935, Becker was transferred to the SS Totenkopf association "Bavaria" as the commander of the recruit training company, and was responsible for the unit's transport. In 1937, Becker was promoted to Sturmbannführer (Storm Unit Leader/major) and in 1938 to Obersturmbannführer (Senior Storm Unit Leader/lieutenant colonel). Becker's unit was involved in the Anschluss of Austria and the occupation of the Sudetenland.
World War II.
With the beginning of World War II, the 1st SS Totenkopf Infantry Regiment was upgraded into the new motorized division the 3rd SS Division "Totenkopf". After the Battle of France, Becker was promoted to Standartenführer (Regiment Leader/colonel) and given command of the 1st Battalion,1st Infantry Regiment "Totenkopf". After the start of Operation Barbarossa, Becker assumed temporary command of the regiment. Even after being wounded, he remained in command and was officially appointed regimental commander in August 1941. In September 1941, his command included a motorcycle battalion in a kampfgruppe during the battle of the Demyansk Pocket. For his performance during the battle, he was awarded the German Cross in gold.
With the conversion of the division to an armoured division in the autumn of 1942, Becker was made commander of the 6th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, which after the death of Theodor Eicke adopted his name as an honour title. In August 1943, the regiment was ordered to capture the city of Nikotowka and heights 199 and 197. After heavy fighting, Becker decided to attack with his reserve battalion by advancing in front of a neighboring division which was not involved in the attack. He succeeded in seizing height 197 and rolling up the other two positions. Due to the success of the attack, the division advanced to Mertschik, destroying two Russian divisions, two armored brigades and one motorised brigade. For his actions in key situations, on 7 September 1943, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. In October, he was given command of the division, until in March 1944, he assumed command of the 16th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS in Italy and was promoted to Oberführer (Senior Leader/brigadier general). After Hermann Prieß was given the task of forming the XIII. SS Army Corps, Becker was again in July 1944 given command of the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf. In September 1944, he was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross for the division's actions in Romania and the fighting around Grodno. He was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer (brigadier general) und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS (equivalent to an American brigadier general). Becker was twice mentioned in the daily Wehrmachtbericht (radio report), on 1 and 2 January 1945.
In the next few weeks, the division was involved in fighting to the east of Warsaw and Modlin. In December, it was moved to Hungary for the battles around Budapest.
The division crossed the Danube River to Vienna, shortly before the surrender of German forces. The unit then attempted to surrender to the Americans, but the local U.S. commanders refused to accept the surrender and handed the men over to the Russians.
Captivity.
In captivity, Becker repeatedly looked out for his soldiers and became a problem for the guards. In November 1947, he was put on trial before a Soviet military court in Poltava and sentenced to 25 years forced labor, rebuilding destroyed villages. Allegedly. a fellow prisoner reported him for building a dud grenade in a brick wall, and in February 1953, he was shot for the supposed sabotage.

Bobby McLeod

Bobby McLeod (1947 – 30 May 2009) was an Aboriginal activist, poet, healer, musician and Yuin elder. He was from Wreck Bay Village, Jervis Bay Territory. He was involved in the fight for Aboriginal rights in Australia and travelled the world speaking about cultural lore, health and healing.
Life.
Bobby was born in 1947, the oldest of 6 kids, and a descendant of the Monaro people. He grew up at Worragee, an Aboriginal community outside Nowra. His father, Arthur, was a labourer, a boxer, and an alcoholic. His mother was active in the Worragee-Wreck Bay chapter of the Country Women's Association and the local Baptist church. Her father was Robert Brown, the first Aboriginal stipendiary magistrate. His father's father was a black tracker on the NSW south coast. Bobby started his singing career in the Baptist Youth Fellowship choirs. He learnt to play the guitar from Jimmy Little's family.
Bobby completed his Intermediate at Nowra High School in 1963, excelling at sport. His family moved to the new "model suburb" of Green Valley in Sydney's south-west. In 1966, a Sydney City Mission report on the suburb described "a lack of community life, a breakdown in family life, large numbers of deserted wives, needy children and bewildered people". Within two years of moving there, Bobby had been sentenced to five years in jail for assault and robbery after a fight at Blacktown RSL.
After being released from prison in 1968, Bobby played rugby league for the Redfern All Blacks.
Bobby was in prison a second time in 1973 when his father died. He wrote his first song, "Wayward Dreams", after attending the funeral on day release.
After being released from jail, Bobby lived at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy on the lawns of parliament house in Canberra. On 28 February 1974, he achieved some notoriety when he "arrested" Francis Herbert Moy, an assistant secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA), at gunpoint. The incident happened in the DAA offices in Canberra.
Earlier that day there had been a land rights demonstration when Queen Elisabeth and Prince Philip arrived at Parliament House for the opening of parliament.
Bobby had gone into the DAA office with Reuben John Smith and Neville Foster, looking for the department head, Barrie Dexter, who was away in Tasmania at the time. They held Moy and three other DAA staff members in the office for an hour and a half. Bobby allegedly told them "I'm going to keep you here for four or five days and teach you to starve".
After about an hour Charlie Perkins arrived from outside parliament house and convinced Bobby to give him the gun. Charlie removed the bullets from the gun, which he later handed over to the police. The fact that there were no bullets in the gun when it was given to the police meant that Bobby was only charged with possession of an unlicensed gun, rather than the much more serious charge that would have followed if it had been loaded.
Bobby was fined $40 for the incident and put on a 12-month good behaviour bond. He remained grateful to Charlie Perkins for having the presence of mind to remove the bullets. The matter was discussed in parliament.
A few days after the incident, during an interview on ABC radio, Bobby said ""I would die for my people, I'm not frightened of that"".
After that, Bobby left Canberra for Melbourne, where he played with a group called the Kooriers with Paul and Dudley (aka Doug) Meredith, a couple of musicians from Cherbourg in Queensland. They played a lot of union gigs and recorded a demo tape at the ABC studios. According to Bobby, the Kooriers music expressed ""the confusion and frustration of Aborigines and their cultural dilemma which came as a result of westernisation"".
Bobby said later that the reason why the Kooriers didn't go further than they did was because they drank too much. When the Meredith brothers left Melbourne, he immersed himself even more deeply in alcohol, singing here and there, but mostly devoting his life to drinking. He hit rock bottom in 1983 when he went into an alcohol-related coma for seven days, and nearly died. That was his wakeup call and he returned to Nowra, after an absence of twenty years, and gave up drinking permanently.
In 1987, Bobby played at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. While he was there, he met people from the Enrec recording studio and ended up recording with them, Buddy Knox and Mick Lieber. This led to his first album "Culture Up Front" being released by Larrikin Records in 1988.
In 1990, Bobby, along with Vic Simms, Roger Knox and the Euraba band were invited to North America by Indigeous Americans, to play prisons and reservations. When he got back to Australia, he recorded his second album "Spirit Mother", backed by the Flying Emus. Talking about the change of mood from his previous album, Bobby said ""[...] if you sing about the sorrow of things, it sort of keeps people in that sadness. So what I did Spirit Mother was to try and change it to find out what was good about being me and stuff.""
Inspired by his experiences with Indigenous people in Canada, Bobby set up the Doonooch Aboriginal Healing and Cultural Centre at Wreck Bay in 1990 - initially as an attempt to address the high levels of violence found in Aboriginal communities. 'Doonooch' refers to the owl dreaming.
In the early 1990s, he started the Doonooch dance group, primarily as a way to keep young Aboriginal people away from alcohol and other drugs and provide them with gainful employment and a cultural and spiritual awakening. In 2000 the Doonooch dancers performed at the Olympic Games opening ceremony and at the World Indidgenous Forum in Noumea.
In 2002 Bobby McLeod co-taught, along with Dr. Tom Balistrieri, an engineering class at Worcester Polytechnic Institute titled, Indigenous Wisdom and Modern Technology. The class focused on Life Lore and Dead Lore and how engineers must take this into account when designing and building projects. Bobby lived in the home of Tom and Kathryn Balistrieri during that time.
McLeod's album Dumaradje was nominated for Best World Music Album at the 2005 ARIA Awards.
"Wayward Dreams" was featured in both the SBS documentary and the accompanying cd, .

Mittelndorf

Mittelndorf is a village in Saxony, Germany, situated in the district of Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge. It was one of the villages that composed the municipality of Kirnitzschtal. Since 1 October 2012, it is part of the town Sebnitz.
History.
The oldest structure of the village is the mill ("Mittelndorfer Mühle"), built in 1518.
Geography.
Mittelndorf is located in the mountain range of Saxon Switzerland, not too far from the river Kirnitzsch. It lies on the road S 154, between the villages of Altendorf and Lichtenhain (both part of Kirnitzschtal). It lies 8 km from Sebnitz (in north) and Bad Schandau (south), 25 from Pirna, 27 from Děčín (in the Czechia) and circa 50 from Dresden.
Transport.
Mittelndorf has got a rail stop on the DB line Pirna/Bautzen-Neustadt in Sachsen-Sebnitz-Bad Schandau (""Sebnitztalbahn""), situated in the forest close to the village. This stop has a rare peculiarity for a train station situated on a normal national rail line: it has not a road to reach it but a simple forest trail. A similar thing in Europe could be found, for example, in the stations of Kloster Marienthal (Engers-Au line, Germany); Pertosa, in southern Italy; or Corrour, in Scotland.
The village is also served by the suburban tramway line ""Kirnitzschtalbahn"" Bad Schandau-Lichtenhainer Wasserfall, with the stops of Mittelndorfer Mühle (at the mill) and Forsthaus, not too far from Mittelndorf.

Changi Tree

The Changi Tree, also known as The Time Tree, was a 76-meter legendary tree of Singapore. The species of the tree is unclear, but it was either "Hopea sangal" or "Sindora wallichii". It has been said that Changi was named after this tree. It has been recorded that Changi was named after "Neobalanocarpus heimii" by the legendary botanist H.N. Ridley. However, there has been no evidence that the tree had ever been in Changi.
History.
The Changi Tree started appearing on maps at around 1888. The tree was a major landmark due to its height.
In February 1942, during World War II, the tree was cut in order to prevent the Japanese from using the tree as a ranging point. According to folklore, the fall the tree would cause the fall of Singapore itself. This proved true at the Battle of Singapore shortly after the tree had fallen.
In February 2001, the Singapore Tourism Board planted a new "Changi tree" at the Changi Museum.
In December 2010, there is a new discovery of a special sacred tree located in Eunos. The name of the tree is named after the founder "XM".

Pomeranians (German people)

Pomeranians () are a German people living in Pomerania. In the High Middle Ages, Germans from what is today Northwestern Germany, Danes, Dutch and Flemish people migrated to Pomerania during the Ostsiedlung, gradually outnumbering and assimilating the West Slavic tribes of the Rani, Liutizians and Slavic Pomeranians. The evolving society () was speaking Pomeranian dialects of Low German. Mostly German immigration continued until the 20th century. The Thirty Years' War caused a severe population drop, only one third of the pre-war Pomeranian population survived. In the late 19th and early 20th century, many Pomeranians emigrated to prospering West German industrial centers or overseas during the Ostflucht. Low German was gradually replaced by Standard German, though spoken with an accent. After World War II, most of the former Province of Pomerania became Polish, and nearly all Pomeranians living east of the Oder-Neisse line fled or were expelled to post-war Germany. Therefore Pomeranians today live not only in Western Pomerania, but are dispersed all over Germany and other countries.

The Ministère de la Marine (English: Ministry of the Navy, a.k.a. the marine, ministry, department, secretariat of state) was a section of the French government - apart from the Ministry of War (French:Ministère de la Guerre) - that was in charge of the French navy and colonies.
The ministry combined the administration of the navy, the colonies like New France and seaborne trade helping for example the French East India Company. A widely held view at the time was that for states to be powerful, wealthy and prestigious, colonies in the New World need to be maintained for their consequent trade. The maintenance of colonies through naval operations not only served to improve the stature of the state, but was also helpful in destroying their European rivals in North America.
After the Second World War, the Ministry of the Navy was merged with the War Ministry, absorbing the role of the Minister of the Navy and Colonies, with a Minister of National Defence directing the entire military French forces.
Creation and History.
Since the 16th century, the Secretary of State of the Navy (French: Secrétaire d'État de la Marine) was responsible for the French early navy and colonies.
In 1624, Louis XIII’s first minister, Cardinal Richelieu created the first model of the modern French Navy, also known as the Marine or La Royale, run by the Secretary of State of the Navy. The official French Marine was not established until 7 March 1669 by Jean-Baptiste Colbert. At this time, the ministry of marine became an official government department with a permanent staff, holding offices at Versailles. All of the policies and procedures for the marine were established by Colbert.
The Secretary of State of the Navy was responsible for the administration of both the navy (the "marine royale") and civilian (merchant marine) fleets, and for all France's ports, arsenals, consulates, and colonies, as well as the guardianship for all her commercial companies.
The two French royal fleets (the Ponant fleet and Levant fleet) were put under the control of Colbert from 1662, whilst he was "intendant des finances" and "minister of state"—but not "secretary of state" : he only became secretary of state in 1669 after having bought his way into the post. From then on, right up to the French Revolution, a secretary of state had responsibility for the fleet.
To his two original offices (the bureau du Ponant and bureau du Levant) other services were added over time:
These different offices and departments were regrouped into four super-departments by marshal de Castries in 1786.
In 1791, the Secretary of State of the Navy was changed to Minister of the Navy. Before the 1890s, this position also usually had responsibility for France's colonies, and was usually known as Minister of the Navy and Colonies (French: Ministère de la Marine et des Colonies). In 1947 the naval ministry was absorbed into the Ministry of Defence.
Personnel.
At the head of the marine was the Ministre de la Marine, manned by a French statesman. Ministers of Marine typically came from families of administrative nobility (La Plume), such as the Phelypeaux’s. From 1690 until 1749, a Phelypeaux was secretary and minister in charge of the marine and its colonies. The most prominent of the family was Jean-Frederic Phelypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain et Maurepas. Under his guidance, the marine regained much of the strength and prestige that it had lost during the period of the Regencies (1715–1726). As well, he was able to ascertain much larger than normal budgets for the Marine. Thus under Jean-Frederic’s leadership, France was able to regain its reputation as a maritime power.

Charles Austen

Rear Admiral Charles John Austen CB (23 June 1779 – 7 October 1852) was an officer in the Royal Navy. He served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and beyond, eventually rising to the rank of rear-admiral.
Family and early life.
Charles was born in 1779 as the sixth and youngest son of the Reverend George Austen. His elder brother, Sir Francis Austen also joined the navy and eventually rose to be Admiral of the Fleet. Their sister was the famous novelist Jane Austen. Charles joined the Royal Naval Academy in July 1791, and by September 1794 he had become midshipman aboard . He subsequently served aboard and . While serving aboard the "Unicorn" Austen assisted in the capture of the 18-gun Dutch brig "Comet", the 44-gun French frigate "Tribune" and the French transport ship "Ville de l'Orient".
After transferring to the "Endymion" he helped in the driving into Hellevoetsluis of the Dutch ship of the line "Brutus". As a result of the latter action Austen was promoted to lieutenant on 13 December 1797, and appointed to . He was aboard the "Scorpion" long enough to be present at the capture of the Dutch brig "Courier", after which he transferred to . Aboard the "Tamar" Austen was frequently involved in attacks and engagements with gunboats and privateers out of Algeciras. He returned to the "Endymion" in April 1800. On one occasion he set off in a small boat in a gale with only four other men, and succeeded in boarding and taking possession of the 18-gun "Scipio", with 149 men aboard. He kept control of her until the following day when "Endymion" could complete the capture. After continued good service under Captain Charles Paget, the Admiralty promoted Austen to commander and he took command of the sloop on 10 October 1804.
Command.
Austen spent the next five years serving on the North American Station, before his promotion to captain on 10 May 1810 when he was given command of the 74-gun , which was then the flagship of Sir John Borlase Warren. Austen moved again the following September, joining . Between November 1811 and September 1814 Austen served as captain of , based at the Nore and flying the flag of Sir Thomas Williams. He was then given command of the 36-gun frigate and after the outbreak of hostilities with France Austen was dispatched in command of a squadron with and to hunt a Neapolitan squadron suspected to be at large in the Adriatic. After Naples had surrendered Austen was active in the blockade of Brindisi. Lord Exmouth then sent him on to search of a French squadron, but with the end of the war with France in the intervening period he briefly turned his attention to suppressing piracy in the region. He successfully captured two pirate vessels in the port of Pavos, but disaster struck when the "Phoenix" was wrecked off Smyrna on 20 February 1816, through the ignorance of her pilots.
Austen was appointed to the 46-gun on 2 June 1826, and was sent to the Jamaica Station as the second in command. He was active in combating the slave trade and had considerable success, intercepting a number of slave ships. He commanded the "Aurora" for two and a half years, until she was paid off in December 1828. Sir Edward Griffith Colpoys nominated Austen to become his flag captain aboard on the North American and West Indies Station. Austen remained here until being forced to be invalided home after a severe accident in December 1830. Austen recovered and returned to service, being appointed to HMS "Bellerophon" on 14 April 1838. He was awarded a pension on 28 August 1840. He sailed with the "Bellerophon" to the Mediterranean, and was active at the bombardment of Acre on 3 November 1840. As a result of his good service during the bombardment he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 18 December 1840. Austen and the "Bellerophon" returned home, where the latter was paid off in June 1841.
Flag rank and death.
Austen was advanced to rear-admiral on 9 November 1846, and was appointed commander-in-chief in the East Indies and China Station on 14 January 1850, hoisting his flag the following day. He commanded the British expedition during the Second Anglo-Burmese War but died of cholera at Prome on 7 October 1852, at the age of 73. On 30 April 1852 Austen had been thanked for his services in Burma by the Governor-General of India, The Marquess of Dalhousie, who subsequently also formally recorded his regret for Austen's death. Austen is buried in Trincomalee.
Family and issue.
Austen married Frances Palmer, the youngest daughter of the late Attorney-General of Bermuda, in 1807. The two had three children together. After the death of Frances in 1814, Charles married his late wife's sister Harriet Palmer in 1820. The couple produced four children, two of them sons, and one of whom followed his father into the navy.

School of Arabic Studies

The School of Arabic Studies (in Spanish Escuela de Estudios Árabes, EEA) is a research Institute of the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, CSIC) with headquarters at the Houses of the Chapiz in Granada.
This building, declared Object of Cultural Interest according to Spanish legislation, is made up of two former Morisco houses located in the well-known Granada district of Albaicín. The School was born in 1932, when the Schools of Arabic Studies of Madrid and Granada were created with the aim of "protecting and encouraging Arabic studies in Spain". In its early stages, the Granada School was entitled to teach Arabic language and civilization, Hebrew language, Muslim cultural and political history, Islamic law and institutions, Arabic dialectology, art and archaeology. In 1939, after the Spanish Civil War, the School became a part of the newly created Spanish National Research Council and, consequently, it was devoted to research according to the guidelines of this institution. The School of Arabic Studies of Granada is nowadays the only Institute that keeps the original name, after the School of Madrid took other names, and the only CSIC Institute entirely devoted to Arabic studies. The School has a sole department, called "Department of Arabic Studies", which is made up of four research groups dealing with history of al-Andalus, Arabic historiography, medieval archaeology, Islamic architecture, natural science in al-Andalus, Arabic biographical literature, Islamic law, and edition and translation of Arabic texts.

Shin Sung-rok

Shin Sung-rok (born November 23, 1982) is a South Korean actor. He appears in films and television series, but is most famous and active in musical theatre.
Career.
Shin Sung-rok had wanted to become an actor since high school, so when an injury cut short his career as an amateur basketball player (his brother is Shin Je-rok of the Anyang KT&G Kites), he decided to major in Theater and Film at Suwon University (though he later dropped out). Shin made his acting debut in 2003, but found it difficult to find acting jobs since directors were reluctant to cast the 187 centimeter-tall aspiring actor in supporting or minor roles. Thinking he would have a better chance if he gained more acting experience and honed his craft on the stage, Shin switched gears and joined the theater company Hakchon.
When Shin performed in his first musical "Moskito", there were only 20-25 audience members in the 500-seat hall. Despite feeling depressed and frustrated, he said the experience made him strong and helped him become an actor with plenty of guts.
While doing the musical "Dracula", Shin was cast in his first substantial onscreen role, in the risqué cable drama "Hyena". Supporting roles in dramas and films followed, notably in "Thank You" and "My Life's Golden Years" (also known as "All About My Family"). He also appeared on season 1 of the MBC dating reality show "We Got Married" as a "fake couple" with female comedian Kim Shin-young. 
Mainstream breakthrough still eluded Shin, but in theater his star was rising. In 2007 Shin was picked from 400 auditionees for the lead role Solomon in "Dancing Shadows", a musical adaptation of the realist play "Forest Fire" by celebrated Korean playwright Cha Beom-seok. He later received a Best New Actor nomination from the Korea Musical Awards. 
As Shin starred in one hit musical after another, he continued to impress critics and captivate female audiences with his charismatic acting performances, his strong and powerful baritone vocals and his delicate and clear alto notes. He is now considered a top musical star, even drawing fans from outside Korea to his shows. 
His 2010 drama "Definitely Neighbors" was the most successful yet in boosting his TV profile, netting 20% ratings. For his role as a difficult chef who falls in love with an older divorcee, Shin received the Top Excellence Award, Supporting Actor in a Daily Drama at the SBS Drama Awards. 
Despite branching out to film and television, Shin has maintained that his heart will always belong to the stage. "I feel more affection toward the stage (than TV). I think it is the stage where actors learn life and understand the meaning of acting. It is where I learned how to act and where I gained confidence. I think the core of my life will remain on the stage" ("The Korea Herald", 2007). "The musical is like my old home and it made me what I am now, so I can't stop performing the musicals however busy I get. I always covet a good musical and try to do it because a good musical won't wait for me [...] I like musicals because I can communicate with the audience. Also, TV dramas and films are good at portraying characters in detail. I will show better performances in my new work. [...] I hope many become familiar with me through more diverse channels and come to see the musicals and boost musical culture. Personally, I want to let my name become widely known to general audiences." ("The Korea Times", 2009)

Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac

Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac, Duke of Brissac (14 February 1734, Paris - 9 September 1792, Versailles) was a French military commander and peer of France. He was the second son and heir of Jean Paul Timoléon de Cossé Brissac, Duke of Brissac, who was a French general.
Life.
One of the most prominent men at the courts of Louis XV and Louis XVI, he was a Grand Panetier of France, governor of Paris, "capitaine colonel" of the Cent-Suisses of the Garde du Roi, and a knight in various orders.
In 1791, he became commander in chief of the King's Constitutional Guard. On 29 May 1792, the Assembly dissolved this corps, suspecting it of royalist and counter-revolutionary sympathies and accusing Cossé-Brissac of encouraging this and writing a speech ordering his men to go over to the king. He was sent to prison in Orléans to await judgement by the high court before being transferred to Versailles, but the prisoners were separated from their escort and freed by a group of bandits. 
He was killed in the 9 September massacres, and his body was mutilated. With little spirit but much force and courage, he held off his murderers for a long time, receiving several wounds before finally being cut down by a sabre. Always distinguished for his devotion to Louis XVI, he replied to someone praising him for his conduct: "I only do what I must do for my ancestors and my family". He is mentioned in the fifth verse of Jacques Delille's poem "la Pitié", and anecdotes on him are to be found in "Paris, Versailles et les provinces".
Marriage and issue.
Louis-Hercule de Cossé-Brissac married in 1760 to Diane-Hortense Mancini-Mazarini (1742–1808), great-great niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and they had two children:
After the death of Louis-Hercule in 1792 without a direct male descendant, the ducal title passed to Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac (1775-1848). He was the eldest son of Hyacinthe-Hugues de Cossé-Brissac, duc de Cossé (1746-1813), who was the son of René-Hugues de Cossé-Brissac, comte de Cossé (1702-1754).

The Parson's Widow

"The Parson's Widow" (), aka "The Witch Woman", is a 1920 comedy drama film directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer. The film is based on a story "Prestekonen" by Kristofer Janson.
Plot.
Söfren, a recent seminary graduate, and his fiancee Mari make their way on foot through a Norwegian forest to a village where a church is in need of a pastor. Mari's father won't allow her to marry until Söfren obtains a full-time church assignment.
Söfren learns that he is competing with two other men who are affluent scholars from Copenhagen. The three men wait outside the church until the verger calls them in, one by one, to deliver their trial sermons.
The first candidate delivers a sermon on the creation story that promptly puts the entire congregation to sleep. The second candidate is summoned and announces that his sermon topic is "Balaam's ass and God's strange power by which He was able to open the jaws of a dumb animal so that it might speak like a man!" "(Numbers 22:28-30)"
The verger comes out to summon Söfren and finds him doing handstands. Söfren bounds into the church, surveys the congregation and begins:
"Now, two learned applicants have appeared here before me. One of them took us to Eden, and that is as far back as we can go. Let him stay there! The other one chose the text: "Am I Not An Ass?" But what has an ass to do on the pulpit? My friends, I will not take you to Eden -- you are too clever. But I will take you to the bowels of the earth, deep in the roaring jaws of Hell!" The congregation is enthralled by Söfren's "fire and brimstone" sermon. Söfren concludes: "And so my friends, beware that you are not swallowed up by the roaring jaws of Hell!"
Söfren's rivals from Copenhagen host a dinner for the townspeople and feel obliged to invite Söfren. The church committee announces that Söfren is their choice for pastor. The committee spokesman then adds that Margarete Pedersdotter, the widow of the previous pastor, has exercised her right to demand that her husband's successor marry her.
Dame Margarete, who is at least a half-century older than Söfren, enters the room. The two pastoral candidates from Copenhagen bolt from the room, hastily climb on their horses and gallop away.
Margarete doesn't take a seat near Söfren but chooses to sit next to the fireplace. Gradually the townspeople also leave the dining hall. After a lengthy period of silence, Margarete approaches Söfren and asks, in that it has grown dark outside, if he would walk with her to the parsonage.
When they reach the parsonage, Margarete invites Söfren inside. As Söfren takes note of the fine furnishings, Magarete lays out another repast, which Söfren devours greedily despite having just come from the town dinner. While he is eating, Margarete asks Söfren if he has a fiancee. Söfren hesitates, then assures her that he does not.
Margarete mentions that it is much too late for Söfren to head back to the inn and suggests he stay in an upstairs room. The next morning Söfren puts on a fine suit of clothes, far superior to his own garments, that was laid out by his bed during the night. Söfren goes downstairs. Margarete is sewing and the table has been set with a fine breakfast of herring, bread and butter, and a canister of schnapps.
After Söfren finishes the schnapps, Margarete takes on the appearance of a smiling 20-year-old. Margarete asks if he would like to marry her; Söfren replies in the affirmative. Margarete calls in her two servants from the next room as witnesses of Söfren's proposal. Margarete assures Söfren they will have separate sleeping quarters and maintain separate lives.
Söfren leaves to tell Mari what has happened, and Margarete follows at a distance. A tearful Mari asks Söfren how Margarete bewitched him and Söfren suggests she had hexed the herring. Margarete arrives and confronts Söfren—who is this woman? Söfren replies that Mari is his sister and asks that she be allowed to stay in the parsonage, to which Margarete assents.
Söfren and Margarete are married. The next morning, Söfren is upset when Margarete's female servant shakes debris from a rug on him from a balcony. Margarete's male servant gives Söfren a raspberry when asked to stop whistling.
Söfren confronts Margarete: "In the future, I suggest you and your companions be less high and mighty. For I am master of this house." Margarete goes to a window and taps on it to summon the bearish male servant. She instructs him: "Master Söfren is too big for his boots. Give him a drubbing!" Afterward, Margarete advises her husband: "I suggest you concentrate on prayer and sermons. Do not play master here. I am master of this house!"
Söfren makes several unsuccessful attempts to have time alone with Mari. One day he notices Margarete climb the ladder to the loft of the barn. Söfren removes the ladder, hoping to trap Margarete in the loft, and goes in search of Mari. Mari, however, is also in the loft, and she starts to climb down without noticing that the ladder has been moved. Mari falls to the ground and Söfren rushes over and calls up a warning to Margarete: "Be careful, Dame Margarete! The ladder is gone!"
Söfren carried Mari into the house and learns that she has broken a thigh bone and suffered a concussion but will recover.
Margarete takes on the role of Mari's nurse and, in return, Söfren begins to grow fond of Margarete.
One day, as Margarete and Söfren sit by Mari's bedside, Margarete confesses: "My first husband and I were engaged for many years when he applied for the post here and learned he could have it only if he wedded the parson's widow. We knew that the widow was weak and could scarcely live long. It was a sore temptation to us. God forgive us ... we built our happiness on the hope of another's death."
That prompted Söfren to confess: "Mari and I are not sister and brother -- she is my fiancee. We have also waited for your death, Dame Margarete."
Margarete appears to have initially been taken aback, then her face softens and she murmurs "Poor children!"
From that moment, Söfren and Mari have no trouble spending time together and Margarete spends most of her time in the churchyard, visiting her husband's grave.
One morning Margarete does not come down to breakfast. Söfren and Mari go to her bedroom, where they find her in a peaceful repose after dying in her sleep. Söfren finds a note beside the bed: "Do not forget, when my mortal remains are taken away, to put a horseshoe over the door and to strew linseed after me so that I shall not haunt you."
Margarete is buried beside her husband. As Söfren and Mari stand over her grave, Söfren remarks: "We owe her a great debt, Mari. She taught you to keep a good home and she taught me to be an honorable man."

Max Leon

Max M. Leon (1904 - November 2, 1984) was an impresario, radio producer, conductor, musicologist, opera manager, referee, and businessman. He had a wide array of talents and interests which led him towards a highly diversified career in many fields from running and owning WDAS (AM) from 1950 to 1979, refereeing for Polo sporting events, and owning and operating Whole-Sum Products, a candy factory, for more than four decades. He also was a highly accomplished musician, serving as the founder and conductor of the Philadelphia Pops Orchestra and working as the General Manager of the Opera Company of Philadelphia.
Biography.
Born in Poland to Jewish parents, Leon came to the United States at the age of 16. He began his career working for the Whole-Sum Products candy factory in Philadelphia in the 1920s during which time he also played a variety of instruments in "Max Leon and his Musical Eagles", a local dance band. Leon eventually became the General Manager of Whole-Sum Products and later bought the company in 1934, which he kept going into the 1970s. He notably forged a partnership with Breyers Ice Cream, and the company invented their marshmallow ice cream flavor along with making other products for Breyers.
Leon continued to be active with several amateur musical groups in Philadelphia during the 1930s. He eventually ended up studying conducting with Paul Breisach, a conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, Martin Rich at the Curtis Institute of Music, and Eugene Ormandy, famed director of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Leon financed and founded the Philadelphia Pops Orchestra in 1943 and became the principal conductor. The orchestra was made up of musicians primarily from the Philadelphia Orchestra. He conducted concerts with the orchestra for many years. From 1963–1975 he served as President of the Board for the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company, also serving as general manager from 1972–1975 after the departure of Anthony Terracciano. He oversaw that company's merger with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company to form the Opera Company of Philadelphia (OCP) in 1975. From 1975–1978 he served as OCP's first General Director.
On October 19, 1950, Leon bought WDAS-AM from William Goldman, moving the station from Ocean City, New Jersey to Philadelphia. He ran the station, which was marketed towards the black community, for almost three decades. In October 1979 he sold the station to the National Black Network.
Leon died in Philadelphia in 1984. He was inducted posthumously into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame [http://www.broadcastpioneers.com] in 2007.

9 September massacres

The 9 September massacres were two series of massacres of prisoners at Versailles on 9 September 1792 during the French Revolution. They occurred in the context of the September Massacres. Claude Fournier was accused of complicity in them. Those killed included Charles d'Abancour, Claude Antoine de Valdec de Lessart and Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac.
The prisoners of Orléans.
Une foule agressive les attend au carrefour dit des Quatre-bornes aux fins de parfaire son œuvre de "salubrité patriotique".
Malgré l' opposition de Charles-Jean-Marie Alquier, président du tribunal criminel de Seine-et-Oise et de Hyacinthe Richaud, maire de Versailles, un carnage a lieu. La foule exécute quarante-quatre de ces prisonniers dont Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac, commandant en chef de la Garde constitutionnelle du Roi Louis XVI, Claude Antoine de Valdec de Lessart, ancien ministre de l'Intérieur puis des Affaires étrangères en 1791, Charles-Xavier Franqueville d'Abancourt, ministre de la guerre en 1792. Seuls huit d'entre les prisonniers parviendront à s'enfuir pendant que les têtes des massacrés seront tranchées et empalées sur les grilles du château.
Le rôle de Claude Fournier-L'Héritier dans cette tuerie fut quelque peu équivoque et il fut soupçonné d'avoir participé au carnage. Cependant, il semble avéré que les prisonniers avaient été séparés de leur escorte par la foule, et Fournier n'était pas à leurs côtés quand ils périrent.
Il fut soupçonné d'avoir averti des membres du comité de surveillance de son passage ce jour-là. Le comité aurait dépêché une clique d'égorgeurs sur les lieux. Il semble que Danton lui-même ait été informé à l'avance, par Alquier, du forfait qui se préparait. Danton, ami de Fournier, ferma les yeux. La présence sur les lieux d'Alquier et de Richaud abonde dans ce sens.
Il fut également soupçonné du vol des bagages des prisonniers.
Les bijoux des prisonniers furent, dit-on, dérobés par François Héron, membre du Comité de sûreté générale.
The prisoners of Versailles.
The same evening, the assassins returned to the écuries de la Reine, which had become Versailles' prison, to carry out another massacre of 30 prisoners there.

Alexander Miller (theologian)

Alexander "Lex" Miller (1908 – May 15, 1960) was a New Zealand Presbyterian minister, author, and Stanford University theologian. Violence towards black activists during the Montgomery Bus Boycott led Miller to question commitments to nonviolence as noted by Martin Luther King, Jr. himself in letter sent April 1957.
Life.
Miller was born in 1908 at Stevenston, Ayrshire, Scotland to parents Rev. Matthew & Mrs Leonora Miller. He was the eldest of three brothers. There he married his wife Jean C MacLaren and had a son, David.
Education.
Miller received is Masters from Auckland University, and later went on to Columbia University in the U.S. where he received his doctorate. 
The conferral of the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by the Pacific School of Religion in 1958 was recognition of his contributions, both personal and theological, to theological education.
Career.
Lex Miller's career had three sides: The articulation of the Christian faith in the academic setting, the service of the Christian Church, both his own Presbyterian denomination and Protestant Christianity at large, and the bringing of Christianity to bear on the social, economic, and political spheres of secular life. 
Of these three ends, the last is a thread running throughout his life. In a day when passions ran high over pacifism, the labor movement, and unemployment, he accumulated an impressive jail record in New Zealand from picketing and pacifist demonstrations.
He later went to Detroit in a liaison job between Christian students and industrial workers. It was there that he impressed Reinhold Niebuhr by his activities, and was recommended by Niebuhr as a Lecturer in Religion at Stanford University.
He was the first Professor of Religion at Stanford and in 1950 inaugurated their Department of Religion and became its Head. University). His students were brought through an unusually wide gamut of theological subject-matter and an approach to a theology concerned with the real world. 
He delivered the William Belden Noble Lectures at Harvard in 1957, which were published as his 1958 book "The Man in the Mirror". He wrote two books for Niebuhr’s ‘Christian Faith’ series. In total, he authored 8 books.
Ministry.
Ordained in the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand in 1937, he occupied pastorates there, in England, and in Scotland. While in London Docklands; the area was subjected to continuous bombing attacks and he saw his first Presbyterian Church charge destroyed by the bombing. He then became Assistant to the Rev George MacLeod in the Iona Community. From 1943 to 1945 he was associated with Sir George MacLeod in the Iona Community in Scotland. He served as Pastor in Napier, New Zealand from 1945-1948.
While at Stanford he was a member of the Presbytery of San Jose of the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. He was much in demand as lecturer and preacher in churches and church groups of all denominations.
His theology, rooted in the great Reformation traditions and enlivened by the work and personal influence of Reinhold Niebuhr, sought a responsible and intelligible articulation of the Biblical heritage.
At his death, he was a member-at-large of the Central Committee of the National Student Christian Federation, a member of the Message Committee of the National Council of Churches, and a fellow of the National Council on Religion in Higher Education.
Person.
Stanford University's 1960 Memorial Resolution reports that Lex Miller "retained a rare humility of spirits informed by a study faith and accompanied by a nonchalance about himself," and they would "remember him as a colleague who combined wisdom with innocence, humor with piety, energetic support of academic freedom with unswerving devotion to Christian truth. His own life bore eloquent testimony to a quotation from Karl Barth, which he used as a motto for his Noble Lectures: 'Man is the creature made visible in the mirror of Jesus Christ.'
"Lex was not a pliable personality. He held tenaciously to whatever aspects of truth (that) gripped him. He ventured his whole existence on what he believed; and, because he was sometimes intellectually mistaken, ... he occasionally stumbled. 
But he never altered his convinced conduct just because the results hurt himself." 
These reports on the quality his character were attested to by all those who knew him, including the well known Dr. Gene Scott, who was a student of his at Stanford in the mid-50's.

Penem

A penem is a type of unsaturated β-lactam.
An example is faropenem.
Penems are similar in structure to carbapenems. However, where penems have a sulfur, carbapenems have another carbon.
There are no known naturally occurring penems; all of them are synthetically made.
Structure.
Penem molecules do not occur naturally, and production of penems is an entirely synthetic process.
Although structurally distinct, the penems are often confused with the carbapenem class of drugs. 
Five main penem subgroups — thiopenems, oxypenems, aminopenems, alkylpenems, and arylpenems — have been produced and are distinguished by the side chain (at position 2) of the unsaturated five-membered ring. One structurally distinct penem is BRL 42715. This molecule has no substitution at the above position, but has a bulky group atached to the β-lactam ring, and it displays effective inhibition of class C β-lactamases, but no antimicrobial activity.
One possible consequence of these structural differences of penems from other β-lactams may be reduced immunogenicity and immunogenic cross-reactivity

Jack Massie

Robert John 'Jack' Allwright Massie DSO (8 July 1890 – 14 February 1966) was an Australian first-class cricketer who played with New South Wales and represented them in the Sheffield Shield.
Massie also served in World War I as an officer in the Australian Imperial Force, seeing action at Gallipoli and on the Western Front in France. Injuries sustained in the war ended his cricket career, but he had a successful business career, principally with British American Tobacco.
Early sporting achievements.
Massie was a gifted sportsman, representing New South Wales at numerous sports. As a rugby union footballer he played in the position of second-rower for Sydney University while studying Civil Engineering and represented New South Wales four times. He was picked in the Australian rugby squad to tour New Zealand in 1913 but had to withdraw due to study commitments.
In 1913 he won the NSW Amateur Boxing Heavy Weight Championship and the following year was state champion in the 120 yard hurdles. He also excelled at rifle-shooting and rowing.
First-class cricketer.
A tall left-arm fast bowler, Massie came close to playing Test cricket in 1914 when he was named in the squad to tour South Africa but the series did not go ahead. He had been playing regular first-class cricket for just two seasons but had proved to be a handful for Australian batsmen, taking 59 wickets at 18.66 in the 1912-13 summer and then 37 wickets at 16.32 in 1913-14.
Massie's best performance in a match came in a Sheffield Shield encounter in 1912/13, with New South Wales taking on Victoria. His second innings figures of 7 for 110 gave him 11 wickets for the match and included the scalps of Warwick Armstrong and Jack Ryder.
He was generally an ineffective batsman but did manage a half century against Western Australia in 1912 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. New South Wales declared their second innings at 8/375 once he reached the milestone and went on to win the match.
World War I campaign.
Massie, who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 17 August 1914, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Battalion on 14 September, served with distinction during the war. His battalion embarked for Egypt in October, and he was promoted lieutenant on 1 February 1915. He took part in Australia's campaign at Gallipoli and in just his second day in the conflict was fortunate to survive a suicidal advance towards the Turkish lines, resulting from orders that were misunderstood by his battalion, when his commanding officer was killed, Massie tried to recover his body. While fighting at Gallipoli he wore a scarlet rag on his right arm so that if he was shot by the Turkish marksmen it would likely be to the arm that stood out and not his left arm which he used for bowling.
Massie received slight wounds on 25 June, and 20 July, he was seriously injured on the night of 6–7 August 1915, during the Battle of Lone Pine by shrapnel. The cricketer had been sent by a junior officer to investigate an outpost which was under fire, and was struck by an exploding shell. The shrapnel lodged into the back of his left shoulder and he also suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs. The injury was serious enough for him to be repatriated to Australia, he was promoted to captain during the journey, on 1 December.
Massie was Mentioned in Despatches on 28 January 1916 for his service in the Dardanelles, and awarded the French Croix de Guerre. He was promoted major on 1 May, and appointed second in command of the newly raised 33rd Battalion, which he had previously been involved in training. The battalion departed Sydney, New South Wales on the transport "Marathon" on 4 May, and arrived at Devonport on 9 July. The battalion was sent to France with the 3rd Division on 21 November.
Massie was Mentioned in Despatches a second time on 1 June 1917, for his actions prior to 9 April 1917. He was attached to the divisional HQ during May and June 1917. On a brief period of leave in England in August, and despite his previous injuries, he played in a cricket match at Lord's on a combined Australian and South African services side against a combined British Army and Navy side. The "Colonials" (as a report in "The Times" referred to them) won convincingly, with Massie taking 2/31. From October to December he was a student on a higher command course. Returning to France, he was again severely wounded on 3 February 1918, a training exercise behind the lines being interrupted by a solitary German bomb, the resulting shrapnel badly damaging his right foot. He received a further Mention in Despatches for his actions prior to 7 April 1918, this was gazetted on 28 May 1918, and he then received the Distinguished Service Order on 3 June 1918.
After Massie's initial recuperation he trained with the Machine Gun Corps at Grantham, passing the tests to command a machine gun battalion. He was attached to the Australian Corps School on 12 September, appointed commandant on 24 September, and promoted to lieutenant colonel on 21 October. He was demobilised on 16 August 1919. His combined injuries meant he never played competitive cricket again.
Business career.
Before the war Massie had been employed by British American Tobacco and returned to work with them in 1919. During the 1930s and 1940s he was Chairman of Directors for British American Tobacco's operations in Australia and also at W.D. & H.O. Wills while also serving as Director of the Commercial Banking Company. He also worked at the Ministry of Munitions to help out in World War II. From 1946 to 1951 he served as the Deputy Chairman of the British American Tobacco in London before retiring.
Personal life.
Massie was married twice, his first marriage being to Phyllis Wood Lang at Holy Trinity Brompton, London, on 3 June 1919. They had a son named John who was killed in action during World War II, Phyllis died soon after. Massie remarried to a widow, Elizabeth Emily Squire (née Crosse) in Washington DC on 20 September 1947. His father Hugh had also been a cricketer and appeared in nine Tests for Australia. Massie's grandfather, on his mother's side, Thomas Allwright Dibbs was an accomplished banker.
He died on 14 February 1966, at the age of 75, from cancer.

William Munroe (pencil maker)

William Munroe (December 15, 1778 – March 6, 1861) was a prominent cabinet-maker and pencil manufacturer of Concord, Massachusetts.
Early life.
Munroe was born on the Seaver Farm in Roxbury in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. His father was a merchant during the time he was growing up. He received little formal schooling prior to being a teenager. When he was thirteen Munroe worked as a farmhand for a while at his grandparents' farm in Roxbury. Though he liked farming, he figured that there had to be a better way to make a living and desired to learn a skilled trade. At fourteen he became a wheelwright’s assistant. After working at this for a while he quit and briefly became a cabinet-maker’s assistant. He then worked at various day labor jobs through the age of sixteen. When he was seventeen he became employed with his second cousin deacon Nehemiah Munroe, a cabinet-maker in downtown Roxbury. He was exceptionally sharp at this trade, able to follow the written diagrams of the various pieces of furniture to make them precisely. He had his own innovative ideas and even devised a new method of hanging table leaves from its hinges, drawing a new concept that was followed thereafter.
Munroe became a journeyman in the shop for about six months after becoming twenty one years old, completing his apprenticeship. In 1800 he left and went to Concord, Massachusetts. There he worked for his older brothers, Daniel and Nathaniel, who were clockmakers. He passed his time by making clock cases. The brothers wrote in Munroe on a contract as a full partner in their business from 1801 though 1804.
Mid life.
In 1805 Munroe married Patty, daughter of Captain John Stone. Patty’s family was wealthy and her father had died before they were married. They immediately took up residence in a part of the brick house that was Patty's mother's. In 1806 their first child was born, William Jr. Two years later they moved to a part of the building where the shop was where he was working as a clockcase-maker. Munroe also made some furniture, besides clockcases, which he took to Boston to sell. In 1810 he traded some clocks in Norfolk for some corn and flour. He traded the flour to a Mr. Prescott, a baker in Concord, in a round about way for a shop at the Concord Mill-Dam Company that Mr. Prescott owned. There was a credit crunch in the economy at this time and Mr. Prescott didn't have cash to pay for the flour. In 1811 Munroe moved his family to a small house closer to his shop.
The War of 1812 with England began about this time. There were many embargo laws then enforced and basically little trading with Europe in general. His cabinet-making business was all but rubbed out as the New England economy was in a recession at the time. It turned out little importation of European products came to America because of the war. There was a sharp incentive to make items in New England that were normally made in Europe. Many products were scarce and much rewarded for those that could produce them in America. Munroe figured there had to be a way to exploit this concept so thought of some ideas of things he could make. Being practical he first produced cabinetmaker’s squares since he already had skills in this area and it would be easy for him to make these. He did his level best selling them at a fair price, however competition eventually made his business decline. He then noticed the scarcity of imported pencils and the high price that people paid for them. Munroe figured that making these for people was a financial opportunity. He learned of earlier users that were successful in selling them, like Benjamin Franklin who promoted pencils in the "Pennsylvania Gazette" in 1729. It is not known for sure if Munroe was inspired by Franklin's expression "Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing", however he did point out,
Straight away Munroe obtained a few lumps of black graphite which he beat to a pulp with a hammer. He separated the fine particles that floated to the top of the water with a spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker’s squares and sold the few he could of these. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others as they might take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with graphite powder formulas on his own. Eventually he figured a way to come up with a suitable graphite paste formula of various ingredients that could be poured into a slotted line made in some cedar wood blanks. The pencil centers would be his secret formula of a mixture of dried graphite paste of clay and other unknown ingredients. They were air dried and not hardened by firing in a furnace as Europeans did, so the quality was not as good as theirs—but it was fine enough to write with.
On July 2, 1812, he had produced about thirty pencils and sold them to a Benjamin Andrews, a hardware dealer on Union Street in downtown Boston. These were the first wooden-cased graphite lead pencils manufactured in the United States. Andrews was a previous customer of Munroe’s, to whom he had sold cabinetmaker’s squares. He ordered more immediately, which Munroe proceeded to grind out. Munroe showed up at Andrew’s hardware store with over four hundred pencils less than two weeks later. Andrews then wrote up a contract with Munroe to take for a price all the pencils that he could make in a certain time frame.
Munroe had then made a business out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only the help of his wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time he went back to the drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.
Munroe decided in 1819 he would go into pencil manufacturing full-time. He no longer desired to be number two. He made a square deal with his employees then to sell them his furniture business. He contracted with them to make his cabinet maker’s squares and pencil blanks for payment of the shop business. Munroe in turn then produced the unique graphite paste for his pencils, of which only he and his wife knew the secret formula. He rented an old textile factory building and there fabricated pencils on a large scale. In 1835 alone he made over 5 million pencils. He took the lead out to become the best manufacturer of American pencils.
Munroe figured that the best way to make pencils was by starting with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The next step was to glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.
The business was a struggle at first, however in ten years' time he had sharpened his skills to perfection. He figured out how to make his machinery fabricate the wooden pencils efficiently in the old textile factory, creating the first and the most successful pencil company in the United States. Munroe took the lead in manufacturing pencils in the United States from that time forward as long as he was in the pencil business. He also make ever-pointed-pencil leads that were very popular.
There were others in Massachusetts that would follow his lead, including one of his former employees, Ebenezer Wood, who would invent the first pencil-making machinery. Some of his competitors that contemplated competing against him were Henry David Thoreau and the Thoreau family. Another competitor to be pointed out that made pens was Benjamin Ball while Joseph Dixon also made pencils and pens. Munroe led the pencil industry in the United States into the 1840s. It should be pointed out that some were not on the level and illegally copied Munroe's techniques of pencil making. They counterfeited his stamps and labels. At least two were found guilty in Massachusetts. Another merchant in New York imported German-made pencils with "W. Munroe" printed on them to be sold as an illegal "knock-off" product. Those pencils were confiscated and destroyed with a fine of five hundred dollars.
Munroe's son Francis apprenticed as a pencil manufacturer and maker under the training of his father. In 1848 the entire "William Munroe Pencil Company" was given to him. By 1854 the business no longer penciled out for Francis so he wrote it off. He contracted with others for his stock in the company and moved to Manchester, Vermont.
Later life.
In 1844 Munroe moved closer into the city of Concord, near the railroad that had recently come into town. This residence became his retirement home where he lived the rest of his life. He died March 6, 1861. Munroe was little known beyond the circle of his personal friends. He called himself a Federalist of the old school and a Whig, admiring the views of Daniel Webster. He liked music and was an excellent singer. William Munroe, the pencil maker, was a 7th cousin of President James Monroe, the 5th US President.

Kumikyoku Nico Nico Douga

Overview.
Kumikyoku Nico Nico Douga was first uploaded at 5 June 2007 with the title 「Nico Nico Douga中毒の方へ贈る一曲」 and continued to be worked on. A second version was uploaded on 23 June. The number of views skyrocketed to over 1.8 million after little more than 2 months. From July to August in 2007, the video maintained first position in number of views, with over 3.3 million comments, and was in over 100,000 mylists at the height of its popularity. Its popularity was thanks in part to subsequent videos.
Reception.
5 days after the original video was uploaded, another user uploaded a version with his own singing. After that, many users began to upload spin-offs (such as the play version, dance version) of the original video. Some of the lyrics from the original songs were improvised or mondegreen were used instead. Users sometime compile multiple user versions of the medley to form a 'chorus' video. Most of these "auditory illusions" were already well-known/prevalent on Nico Nico Douga.
The videos attracted a lot of singers who would add their own vocals to karaoke versions of the songs, the number of such videos far exceeded that of earlier videos. 
It's often misunderstood that the title is not a "music selection" in a strict sense, only "Nico Nico Douga medley songs used in it".
Some other videos posted include ones where users played instruments (recorder, piano, violin, a variety of drums and even bamboo flutes and other musical instruments) or an entire Orchestra performing an instrumental version of the song.
The medleys were also translated and sung in English, Hebrew, French, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Malay and Tagalog. Two such well known versions are the ones by C_Chat and the National Central University.
2 August 2007, C_Chat, a user of the Taiwan BBS board PTT Bulletin Board System, used a week of time to compile a group of people singing Kumikyoku in a chorus and also uploaded it to Nico Nico Douga. This is the first video based on Kumikyoku Nico Nico Douga outside of Japan, and also let Japanese users realise that Nico Nico Douga had a lot of overseas users.
Lists of songs used.
The following is a list of songs used in the videos of the Kumikyoku Nico Nico Douga series.
Nico Nico Douga Ryūseigun.
Nico Nico Douga Ryūseimusume.
Although not officially in this version of the medley, the melodies of the songs Montague Family and Capulet Family (Dance of the Knights) from Romeo × Juliet and You are the Prince of Tennis from The Prince of Tennis musicals can still be heard.
Nanairo no Nico Nico Douga.
The last section (ED1 - ED28) is also called "HEROES".
Others.
In 26 December 2007, Lantis published 「らき☆すたRe-Mix002〜『ラキスタノキワミ、アッー』【してやんよ】〜」, a "mixed music collection" based on Lucky Star. One of the songs in the collection, 「組曲『らき☆すた動画』」, was to pay tribute to the creativity of Kumikyoku Nico Nico Douga.
5 March 2008， the same company published a similar music CD called “”.

Output

Output is the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process. It is an abstract concept, used in the modeling, system(s) design and system(s) exploitation.
Types of output.
In control theory.
In control theory, the outputs of a system are what can be measured. Specifically, outputs are differentiated through many states.
In engineering.
In engineering the term output can refer to:
In equity theory.
In equity theory, output is the benefits that an employee receives, including money, perquisites, power, status, fame or variety.
In human-computer interaction.
In human–computer interaction, output is information produced by the computer program and perceived by the user. The kinds of output the program makes, and the kinds of input the program accepts, define the user interface of the program. In this context, feedback and output are often used interchangeably. However, output tends to refer specifically to explicit output, something that is intentionally provided for the user, whereas feedback also encompasses byproducts of operation that happen to contain information (see low-key feedback).
In information processing.
In information processing, output is the process of transmitting information or the transmitted information itself. The output of one process may well form the input for another information processor. Essentially, output is any data leaving a computer system. This could be in the form of printed paper, audio, video. In the medical industry this might include CT scans or x-rays. Typically in computing, data is entered through various forms (input) into a computer, the data is often manipulated, and then information is presented to a human (output).
Economics.
In economics, output is the amount of goods and services produced by a person, machine, firm, industry, or country etc. during a specific time period, such as a year. A distinction is drawn between Gross Output and Net output.

Columbia Gorge Hotel

The Columbia Gorge Hotel is a historic hotel in Hood River, Oregon, United States. It was built by Simon Benson, who was involved with the Columbia Gorge Scenic Highway. Benson envisioned a hotel at the end of the highway, and completed the Mission style hotel in 1921. The new hotel was built on the site of the previous Wah Gwin Gwin Hotel, built in 1904. Between 1925 and 1952, the hotel went through several changes of ownership.
The then-48-room hotel closed in 1952, when it was sold to the Neighbors of Woodcraft, a non-profit fraternal benefit society based in Oregon since 1905, and converted into a retirement home. It was sold again in 1978, with the new owners planning to reopen it as a hotel. After a $1-million renovation, the now-42-room hotel reopened in September 1979.
In January 2009, the landmark hotel closed its doors again, due to foreclosure. The foreclosing bank later re-opened the hotel before selling it to Vijay Patel's A-1 Hospitality Group in October 2009 for around $4 million. Between 2009 and 2012, the hotel underwent a major renovation. The Columbia Gorge Hotel is recognized as one of the Historic Hotels of America by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
Guests of the hotel have included Burt Reynolds and Shirley Temple, among others.

The Primal Order

The Primal Order, or "TPO", is a religion-based fantasy roleplaying game supplement". Of particular note, TPO was the first work published by Wizards of the Coast and its president, Peter Adkison. Through "TPO", Wizards of the Coast introduced the "Capsystem" concept, enabling gamemasters to seamlessly integrate TPO and future Capsystem titles into other role-playing games. 
The supplement covers high-powered gaming and the gods. TPO provides guidelines for gamemasters to develop individual gods of various power levels, to include entire pantheons, as well as the vast support network, both divine and mortal, required to maintain and increase godly status. These guidelines stem from the foundational concept of primal energy, its sources and impact, as well as its resource management. 
TPO received very good reviews from various sources, including "Pyramid Magazine" and RPGNet. 
As part of the sale of Wizards of the Coast to Hasbro in 2001, Adkison retained the rights to "The Primal Order", his own original work.
Published Supplements.
Wizards quickly followed up the release of TPO with several supplements to help build on the system's foundation. These supplements included: 
Controversy.
One of the driving forces behind the Capsystem concept was to provide gamemasters of various systems with conversion notes to port TPO into their respective games. As such, Wizards solicited conversions for various systems, and included the following conversions with TPO:
Kevin Siembieda, the owner of Palladium Books and Palladium FRPG copyright holder, sued Wizards for copyright infringement. The parties settled the suit out of court, and Wizards released a revised edition of TPO that excluded Palladium. The revised edition also excluded AD&D, D&D and WarpWorld. However, Adkison took advantage of the revision to include these games:
The expanded coverage increased TPO's page count from 232 to 250 pages. It also included new cover art.
Planned Supplements.
Wizards initially planned several supplements, of which two are known:
In addition, the following Capsystem works are mentioned in the Legal Stuff section of both the original and revised editions:
Yet, with the dramatic success of , coupled with previous legal issues regarding their Capsystem approach, Wizards focused almost entirely on collectible card games and did not release any further Capsystem books.
Other Conversions.
Although TPO received no further official support beyond the 1995 revised edition, several folks have put forth other game system conversions for the system, to include:

Prussian T 11

History.
The Prussian Class T 11 were passenger tank locomotives in the service of the Prussian state railways that were intended for duties on the Berlin Stadtbahn. To that end 470 engines of this type were procured between 1903 and 1910. Like the superheated locomotive, the Prussian T 12, the T 11 evolved from the T 9.3 in order to replace the older, four-coupled tank engines. Construction of the T 11 was ceased in 1910 in favour of the more economical T 12.
In 1923, 16 engines were fitted with a superheater, but they retained their existing running numbers.
In 1925, the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the 358 remaining locomotives as DRG Class 74.0–3, allocating them the numbers 74 001–358. 
The locomotives were employed together with the T 12s especially on the Berlin Stadtbahn until its electrification in 1926–1933; as a result they had direction plates ("Richtungsschilder") on their smokebox and coal tanks. But they were also used in suburban services for other cities such as Frankfurt, Hamburg and Altona. 
At the end of World War II there were still 120 examples of these engines in service, 65 with the Deutsche Bundesbahn and 55 with the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) in East Germany. The majority of T 11s were retired by 1960; but two engines (74 231 und 74 240) continued to work the Erfurt industrial railway until 1974.
Two locomotives have been preserved: 74 104 and 74 231. The former was left in Poland after the Second World War where this class was designated as PKP Class OKi1. 
The second was restored in 1998/99 in the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works for the Minden Museum Railway (MEM) and has been working since 2000. It is the former "Hannover 7512".
Design.
All four axles of the locomotives – even the carrying axles – were more or less equally loaded with a hefty 16 tonnes. The carrying axle was linked to the first coupled axle via a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. The axles were located in a plate frame, inside which a well tank was rivetted. 
The first units had piston valves, the later ones slide valves. The riveted boiler barrel comprised two boiler shells and the smokebox was also rivetted. At the back of the boiler was the copper firebox. Two vacuum "Dampfstrahlpumpen" served as feed pumps. 
For the brakes, there was, next to the smokebox a single-stage air pump, and in front of the carrying axle were one or two air reservoirs. 
T 11 of the Lübeck-Büchen Railway.
The Lübeck-Büchen Railway also placed nine T 11s in service between 1905 and 1908. 
The four engines taken over by Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1938, with numbers 74 361 to 74 364, were however not the Prussian T 11 - that had already been retired or sold off by then - but the LBE's own special designs based that were more like the Prussian T 9.3 and which had been built in 1911/1912 by Linke-Hofmann in a batch of five. The drive resembled that of the T 11, apart from the smaller coupled wheels with a 1,400 mm diameter, whilst the boiler was smaller too. The last of these engines was not retired until 1951.

Tony Kelly (footballer)

Anthony Gerald "Tony" Kelly (born 1 October 1964) is an English former footballer, who played mainly in central midfield.
A former Liverpool trainee, he moved from non-league Prescot Cables to Wigan Athletic in 1984. The club's Player of the Year in 1985, he also helped Wigan to victory in the 1985 Football League Trophy Final. Sold on to Stoke City in 1986 for a £80,000 fee, he was moved on to West Bromwich Albion for £60,000 a year later. Loaned out to Chester City and Colchester United, he was transferred to Shrewsbury Town in January 1989 for a £30,000 fee. Two years and more than 100 games later, he was sold to Bolton Wanderers for £100,000. A popular player at Bolton, he helped the club to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1992–93. Released in 1994, he had brief spells at Port Vale, Millwall, Wigan Athletic, Peterborough United, Altrincham and Sligo Rovers, before he retired in 1997.
Playing career.
Kelly began his career as an apprentice at Liverpool, before joining non-league Prescot Cables in 1983. He returned to the Football League in January 1984, signing for Third Division Wigan Athletic. He made just over 100 appearances for Wigan, and was voted Player of the Year in 1985, after he scored in a 3–1 victory over Brentford in the Football League Trophy Final at Wembley. The club missed out on promotion in 1985–86 after finishing one point behind third-place Derby County.
He moved on to Second Division Stoke City in April 1986, as manager Mick Mills paid out a fee of £80,000. However Mills and Kelly did not enjoy a happy relationship, and Mills ordered Kelly to lose weight not long after his arrival at the Victoria Ground. He still played 43 games for the "Potters" in 1986–87, scoring four goals, before he was sold to Ron Saunders' West Bromwich Albion for £60,000 in July 1987.
Ron Atkinson replaced Saunders as manager in September 1987, and so Kelly's impact at The Hawthorns was limited in 1987–88. He instead had successive loan outings with Chester City and Colchester United in 1988. At Chester he was reunited with Harry McNally, the man who had signed him at Wigan; however he only played five league games for the "Seals". He scored two goals in twenty games for Colchester in 1988–89, as the club struggled at the foot of the Fourth Division.
In January 1989, Shrewsbury Town manager Ian McNeill secured Kelly's services for £30,000. Just as with Wigan some years previous, he scored 15 goals in 101 Third Division appearances, however this time after two years he was sold on to Phil Neal's Bolton Wanderers for £100,000.
He established himself in the first team in 1991–92, and his consistent performances led to him being named on the PFA Team of the Year. He continued to be a first team regular under new manager Bruce Rioch, and helped the "Trotters" to win promotion out of the Second Division as runners-up in 1992–93, before leaving the club at the end of the 1993–94 campaign.
In three years with Bolton, Kelly became a firm favourite with the fans, who nicknamed him Zico in homage to Kelly's footballing style, despite his (at times) obvious weight and fitness problems. He was a cult figure with the fans during his stay at Burnden Park and was a key figure in the exciting team that Bruce Rioch built, as Bolton rose from Third Division obscurities to FA Cup 'giant killings' and pushing at the door of the newly formed Premier League. In total he amassed over 100 league appearances for the club before September 1994, when at age of 30 he was given a free transfer to Port Vale.
He did not find success at Vale Park, despite finding the net against Notts County, and instead moved on to Millwall later in 1994. Kelly struggled to regain his form and fitness, and after two games for the "Lions" he returned to former club Wigan Athletic, before signing for Peterborough United. He played 13 league games for United, before returning to Wigan in 1995, and finally dropping out of the Football League as he represented non-league Altrincham. In 1997 he enjoyed a spell in the League of Ireland with Sligo Rovers under Jimmy Mullen; Kelly scored his only league goal for the club on his debut; he made a total of 17 appearances for Sligo before retiring.
Post-retirement.
In 2008, Kelly rejoined Bolton Wanderers as Fans Liaison Officer. Like his former teammate John McGinlay, Kelly is a 'converted' Bolton fan and has a weekly column in The Bolton News where he gives an insight into recent events at the Wanderers. He now also coaches Bolton Wanderers' U18s alongside David Lee, Kelly's former team-mate. In a September 2008 poll of Bolton fans, Kelly was voted the 34th greatest player to ever don a Bolton shirt.
Personal life.
Kelly is a cousin of Joey Barton.

Longitude (book)

Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time is a best-selling book by Dava Sobel about John Harrison, an 18th-century clockmaker who created the first clock (chronometer) sufficiently accurate to be used to determine longitude at sea—an important development in navigation. The book was made into a television series entitled "Longitude". In 1998, "The Illustrated Longitude" was published, supplementing the earlier text with 180 images of characters, events, instruments, maps and publications.
Problem of longitude.
Determining longitude on land was fairly easy compared to the task at sea. A stable surface to work from, a comfortable location to live in while performing the work and the ability to repeat determinations over time made for great accuracy. Whatever could be discovered from solving the problem at sea would only improve the determination of longitude on land.
Determining latitude was relatively easy in that it could be found from the altitude of the sun at noon with the aid of a table giving the sun's declination for the day. For longitude, early ocean navigators had to rely on dead reckoning. This was inaccurate on long voyages out of sight of land and these voyages sometimes ended in tragedy as a result. 
In order to avoid problems with not knowing one's position accurately, navigators have, where possible, relied on taking advantage of their knowledge of latitude. They would sail to the latitude of their destination, turn toward their destination and follow a line of constant latitude. This was known as "running down a westing" (if westbound, easting otherwise). This prevented a ship from taking the most direct route (a great circle) or a route with the most favourable winds and currents, extending the voyage by days or even weeks. This increased the likelihood of short rations, scurvy or starvation leading to poor health or even death for members of the crew and resultant risk to the ship. 
Errors in navigation have also resulted in shipwrecks. Motivated by a number of maritime disasters attributable to serious errors in reckoning position at sea, particularly spectacular disasters such as the Scilly naval disaster of 1707 which took Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell and his fleet, the British government established the Board of Longitude in 1714. 
The prizes were to be awarded to the first person to demonstrate a practical method for determining the longitude of a ship at sea. Each prize, in increasing amounts, was for solutions of increasing accuracy. These prizes, worth millions of dollars in today's currency, motivated many to search for a solution.
Britain was not alone in the desire to solve the problem. France's King Louis XIV founded the Académie Royale des Sciences in 1666. It was charged with, among a range of scientific activities, the improvement of maps and sailing charts and advancement of the science of navigation. From 1715, the Académie offered one of the two "Prix Rouillés" specifically for navigation. Spain's Philip II offered a prize for the discovery of a solution to the problem of the longitude in 1567; Philip III increased the prize in 1598. Holland added to the effort with a prize offered in 1636. Navigators and scientists in most European countries were aware of the problem and were involved in finding the solution. Due to the international effort in solving the problem and the scale of the enterprise, it represents one of the largest scientific endeavours in history.
Knowing Longitude.
As Dava Sobel explains, "to know one's longitude at sea, one needs to know what time it is aboard ship and also the time at the home port or another place of known longitude-at that very same moment. The two clock times enable the navigator to convert the hour difference into geographical separation. Since the earth takes 24 hours to revolve 360 degrees, one hour marks 1/24 of a revolution or 15 degrees. And so each hour's time difference between the ship and starting point marks a progress of fifteen degrees of longitude to the east or west. Every day at sea, when the navigator resets his ship's clock to local noon when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky, and then consults the home port clock, every hour's discrepancy between them translates into another fifteen degrees of longitude. One degree of longitude equals four minutes of time the world over, although in terms of distance, one degree shrinks from 60.15 nautical miles or 111 km circumference being: 21,653.521 nautical miles, or 24,901.55 statute miles at the Equator, to virtually nothing at the poles. Precise knowledge of the hour in two different places at once - a longitude prerequisite so easily accessible today from any pair of cheap wristwatches - was utterly unattainable up to and including the era of pendulum clocks. On the deck of a rolling ship such clocks would slow down, or speed up, or stop running altogether. Normal changes of temperature encountered en route from a cold country of origin to a tropical trade zone thinned or thickened a clocks lubricating oil and made its metal parts expand or contract with equally disastrous results. A rise or fall in barometer pressure, or the subtle variations in the Earth's gravity from one latitude to another, could also cause a clock to gain or lose time."[http://www.sailtexas.com/long.html]
Recognition.
In recognition of "Longitude" Sobel was named a fellow of the American Geographical Society.

Wang won fights against Russian, American, German, and Japanese martial artists.
Wang and Zhu Guofu defended martial arts historian Tang Hao (Tang Fansheng) from opponents who were angered by his work "Shaolin-Wudang Kao" which refuted the story of Bodhidharma and Zhang Sanfeng as being the creators of Shaolin and Taijiquan.
Liu Jin Sheng, who authored "Chin Na Methods" along with Zhao Jiang, was a student of Wang.
He developed an exercise regime for long life. He published works on martial arts exercises.
At the sixth National Games Wang served as a judge for martial arts and wrestling. When Zhou Enlai visited Burma, Wang, then 80 years old, went with them performed martial arts during the visit. He died when he was 93 years old.
Wang developed "Quan Shr Er Shr Fa" (Twenty Fist Method) as well as "Ching Long Jian" (Green Dragon Sword). He was succeeded by his daughter Wang Ju-Rong and his granddaughters Grace Wu (Xiaogo), Wu Xiaoping and Helen Wu (Xiaorong).

Victoria Day (film)

Victoria Day is a 2009 Canadian indie-film, directed by award-winning writer and film-maker, David Bezmozgis. It was produced by Markham Street Films. The film stars Mark Rendall in the lead role, as well as Holly Deveaux, Sergiy Kotelenets, Nataliya Alyexeyenko, John Mavrogiannis, and Scott Beaudin.
Plot.
The film's story takes place the week preceding the Victoria Day long weekend in Toronto, the year of 1988. The story line depicts the weeklong journey of a sixteen-year-old ordinary teenage boy, Ben Spektor (Mark Rendall), and the conspiring events that sequence to a coming of age story.
The film begins on Sunday May 19, 1988. The Victoria Day weekend is fast approaching, initiating the coming end of another high school year. The attention of characters first seems to rest on the Stanley Cup finals, which are in play in Boston with Wayne Gretzky's Edmonton Oilers facing the Boston Bruins. Since Ben Spektor's life is mostly centered on hockey, he is portrayed as the star player of his Toronto Red Wings minor hockey league team, resembling the skills of a young Gretzky throughout the film's opening scenes. However, a life altering event changes the course of Ben's path as he attends the Bob Dylan concert alongside his juvenile close friends: Sammy (John Mavro) and Noah (Scott Beaudin). While there, Ben spots Jordan Chapman (Mitchell Amaral), his classmate, hockey team-mate, and tormentor, taking a part of what appears to be a routine drug deal. Being short of five dollars to purchase the drugs, Jordan provokes Ben into reluctantly spotting him the remainder. This critical affair seemed hardly significant to Ben at the time— he could not have foreshadowed the life altering consequences this event would have on his future.
As the days pass, Jordan's whereabouts are a mystery, and the city police organize a search party that is ultimately fruitless. With a guilty conscience and the fear of Jordan's disappearance, the days drag on for Ben. However, the sequence of events initiate a budding romance for Ben and Jordan's fifteen-year-old sister, Cayla (Holly Deveaux). From love and romance, to the future of Ben's hockey career, Ben's adolescent life appears to be promising. Yet, the continuous discomfort of his teammate's disappearance preoccupies Ben's life, drastically altering the determined path of his promising future.
Cast and Characters.
Main Protagonist.
While for the most part, everybody carries on as normal, Ben is torn between going forward with his life and remaining tied to Jordan's disappearance. Ben attempts to surpass his sorrow by going on a date with Melanie, but cannot make an emotional connection with her as she is untouched by the events that have recently displaced his life. Instead, Ben seeks an emotional connection with Cayla, seeing as she is more personally affected by her brother's disappearance. While visiting Cayla's house, Ben finally takes the opportunity to tell the Chapmans the detail that he has been omitting from the majority of his community. In spite of his attempts, Ben is yet again rebutted from having closure as Cayla's father unexpectedly orders him out of the house. At home, Ben is confronted by his parents in addition to the overwhelming pressures from his community, to move on from this event. Since he is still incapable of move on, Ben tries to cope with the pressure by engaging in mindless frivolities with Sammy and Noah, leading to the physical impairment that further stops Ben from moving on with life.
In an interview, Mark Rendall said that he embodied some of the director and writer, David Bezmozgis' traits in order to accurately portray the character as the writer/director intended. Mark Rendall also notes that he has had a one- to two-year gap, without a leading role before this movie.
Supporting Characters.
In addition, Sammy places emphasis on being unique, which would explain his frustration at Noah's attempts to mimic his behavior and dress style. Sammy's desire to stand apart from the norm, and his willingness to act bizarre, emphasize his values on individuality.
In an interview, it is revealed that "Victoria Day" is John Mavro's first role in a feature film.
Themes.
Autonomy and Responsibility.
A strong theme in David Bezmozgis' film, "Victoria Day", is that of maturation—the coming of age from an adolescent to an adult. Through the beginning of the film, Ben Spector is completely dedicated to his hockey team, refusing to miss hockey practise despite the incentive that his crush, Jordan's sister Cayla, would be attending. Ben's success as a star player on his Toronto Red Wings hockey team, is enthusiastically supported by Yuri Spektor, Ben's father who encourages Ben to watch Wayne Gretzky's games in hopes his son will pursue his promising hockey career.
Ben's teenage life appears to be inconsistent. He seems to be at an age stuck between adulthood and the joys of childhood. While he attempts to maturely please his father and pursue hockey, Ben, alongside his reckless friends Noah and Sammy, engage in immature behaviours. A couple of days before Victoria Day, Ben and his friends buy fireworks from a peculiar man illegally selling them on the side of the road, after which the boys drive off firing them at the man from which they were bought. This immature act of using fireworks in the means of resembling firearms was clearly not well thought through and foreshadowed the danger and negative outcome to follow. Ben shows an additional lack of maturity when he gives a teammate, Jordan Chapman, five dollars to buy drugs with the intent of getting Jordan to leave him alone.
As the story progresses, Ben is able to realize that he had made the wrong decision by providing Jordan with the money he needed for the drugs. As a form of atonement, he volunteers to join the search parties looking for Cayla's brother. Eventually, Ben confesses to Jordan's father that he had given Jordan the money. The confession furthermore enables Ben with the confidence to confront his own father about his discomfort playing hockey while a member of his team is missing. Through the finale of the film, Ben's maturity is evidently witnessed. Ben is able to decline Cayla's seductive advances, acknowledging her emotional vulnerability due to her brothers disappearance shown through his mature outlook on the situation and his actions.
Love in Parental Relationships.
Love is another central theme in the film "Victoria Day". Although not effectively expressed, Ben Spektor’s immigrant mother and father, care deeply for their son and wish for him to prosper in ways that they themselves could not. This affection is shown when Yuri, Ben father, becomes infuriated as Ben confronts his discomfort in playing hockey while his team-mate is missing. Through his frustration, Yuri explains that he himself, had missed an opportunity for a soccer scholarship when he was Ben's age. His opportunities were squandered by his greater interest in pursuing friendships, drugs and alcohol which leads Yuri to earn a mere living as a masseuse. Due to his genuine care and love for his son, it is understandable that Yuri does not want his son to cast aside the opportunities he did as a youth. Although Ben does not initially comprehend his parents intentions, Yuri is willing to risk his son's feelings towards him, as a loving and supportive father, to ensure the best for Ben.
In addition, Mr. Chapman is distraught when he discovers that his son is missing. He refuses to sleep in the comfort of his own bed in hopes that he will be the first to see his son is home. As stated by his peers and his own sister in the film, Jordan was 'a jerk toward everyone.' Once, when Jordan attended a concert, he did not return home for three days. Despite his troublesome behaviour, Jordan's family put a tremendous amount of effort into organizing volunteer search parties in an attempt to find the missing family member. Before they began, Mr. Chapman, on the verge of tears, ensures that everyone who participated in the search knew how thankful he was for their time. Furthermore, in the final scene of the film, Cayla is seen crying as the hockey game forces her to remember Jordan, confronting the reality that her brother may never be seen again.
Romantic Love.
The theme of love is not solely confined to familial relationships; it is also seen as the relationship between Ben Spektor and Cayla Chapman intensifies. At first, it seems that the relationship consists of nothing more than Ben's infatuation with the girl. He is often teased by his friends for "stalking" Cayla, whilst evidently catching the attention of his other female peers, namely a girl named Melanie, with whom Ben goes on a date with to curb his feelings for Cayla. However, the date seems to intensify Ben's feelings for Cayla. When Ben is given the perfect opportunity to take advantage of Cayla's weak emotional state, he declines her advances— acting as a source of comfort. This demonstration of affection portrays the true depth of his love for Cayla as opposed to a fleeting attraction.
Conflicting Emotions.
Ben Spektor is continually faced with decisions based on whether or not he should exert the effort to perform a task. These decisions are difficult in the sense that each is driven into consideration by conflicting interests. For example, despite his dislike of Jordan Chapman, Ben chooses to join the search to get to know Jordan's sister better seeing as he has had a crush on her for quite some time and never taken the initiative to talk to her. However, Ben's own guilt for providing Jordan with the loan for drugs was undoubtedly a contributing factor.
Similarly, Ben continues to play hockey although he feels that it is morally unjust to continue the games. To Ben, it seems as though the team's commitment to Jordan is lost because he has disappeared and as a result, he no longer attends hockey practices or games. On the other hand, if Ben were to resign from playing, he would not only forsake his commitment to the rest of the team, but he would disappoint his father.
Seeing as though Cayla's actions while visiting Ben were met with an immediate response on his part, there is no question as to whether or not Ben enjoyed her advances. This scene emphasized the maturity Ben had acquired in dealing with the events of the preceding the Victoria Day weekend. Prior to his maturing transformation, Ben surrendered the money to make Jordan stop being a nuisance whereas, with Cayla, he is able to determine that the current course of action would not be the best by considering the future consequences of his actions. These, in turn, proved more influential than the desire to continue his actions, even though the desire had remained.
Reception.
Critical Response.
"Victoria Day" is a mixture between literary fiction and David Bezmozgis' personal life. His stories are similar to his real-life experiences and often depict the typical challenges of Jewish family immigrants. Bezmozgis is the author of the acclaimed book 'Natasha and Other Stories,' which is why it is not surprising that "Victoria Day", appears to be a combination of Bezmozgis' stories.
A lot of suburban Toronto is depicted in the film, including city landmarks like Ontario Place. Since the film is set in Canada and named after a Canadian public holiday, there are definite illustrations of the life of a teenage boy in Canada. Regardless of these distinct references, Bezmozgis states, "I didn't set out to make a film that is distinctly Canadian, I set out to make a movie that reflected my experience of growing up, and it just happened to be in Toronto. It's an experience that could have happened for the most part in Chicago, or New York, Boston or Los Angeles. It happened to take place in Toronto, so there are elements that are specific to Toronto, but the story itself is like any teenage story in North America."
Multiple critics of the film have noted that Bezmozgis' lack of climax had contributed to its lower ratings. It seems like Bezmozgis does not holistically communicate the evolution of a teenager’s life, which may fail to fully illustrate the emotions of a typical North American teenager. However, one can argue that Bezmozgis intended to conclude the film this way, as a means of emphasizing that teenagers are uncertain, before they enter their adult lives.
Finally, the film was featured at the 2009 Sundance film festival, in the World Dramatic Competition category. "In what amounts to a record, the movie was picked up faster for Sundance than any other Canadian film in history - enough to the point that the press kit and other promotional material had to be hastily assembled."

Tilang

Tilang is a raag. This raag occurs in the Ragmala as a ragini of Hindol . Today, it belongs to the Khamaj that (raag classification system). It is/was used a lot in the Islamic Sufi tradition and in modern singing styles such as Tumri and Ghazal. Gurbani in this raag is sprinkled with Islamic vocabulary, further highlighting its Islamic Sufi origin.
Tilang is used by Guru Nanak (6 hymns), Guru Ram Das (3), Guru Arjan(5), Guru Tegh Bahadur (3), Kabir (1) and Namdev (2) for a total of 20 hymns. 
Tilang is performed mostly at night (3pm to 6pm); it has a mellow, semi-romantic and pleasing mood but with a hint of yearning. In the texts composed for this raag, the question is asked why man should cling to all the evils of this life when Guru Nanak Dev Ji has shown the way to true happiness and fulfilment. 
This raag is mostly sung as mid-scale raag but it's perfectly appropriate to use all three scales in this raag.
This raag has a Ni flat (ni komal) in the descent.
It's defining characteristics are: PS'NS'nP, PS'NS'PnP, some ragis add a R (S*R*NS*PnP).
The very popular Bani: "Sahib Mera Meharvaan" is written in this raag, the nature of the Bani is very much in keeping with the nature of Tilang.
Aroh : Sa Ga ma Pa Ni Sa
Avroh : Sa ni(komal) Pa ma Ga Sa 
Vadi : Ga 
Samvadi : Ni
There is a variant of this raag in Gurbani called Tilang Kafi.

Dolf Kessler

Geldolph Adriaan "Dolf" Kessler (2 April 1884 – 20 August 1945) was a Dutch footballer and industrialist. Kessler – along with brother Boeli and cousins Tonny and Dé – played club football for amateur side HVV Den Haag. Kessler also won three caps for the Dutch national side between 1905 and 1906.
Family Background.
Kessler was born in a very wealthy family from The Hague, the oldest son of six children. His father Jean Baptiste August Kessler (1853–1900) was the first director of the Koninklijke Maatschappij tot exploitatie van Petroleumbronnen in Nederlandsch-Indië (K.N.M.E.P.) ("Royal Dutch Society for the exploitation of Petroleumsources in the Dutch East-Indies"), which would eventually turn into the Koninklijke Nederlandse Petroleum Maatschappij ("Royal Dutch Petroleum Company"), now named Royal Dutch Shell.
Football career.
Dolf made his debut as a football player at seventeen years of age, at the Hague football club HVV. At first he stood leftback, later he was a right winger. At HVV he became national champion four times between 1901 and 1905. On 30 April 1905 he was captain during the first official interland of the Dutch national team. They beat Belgium with a 4–1 score. The second interland and first home match also saw Kessler leading the team. For his third and last interland in 1906 Dolf had passed the captaincy on to Kees Bekker. Kessler seriously considered a career in football until later that year he dislocated his knee, ending his career in football. Sports, however, remained important to him.
Business career.
In 1907 Kessler graduated from the Technische Hogeschool Delft ("Delft University of Technology"), as a mechanical engineer. He got a job as secretary for Henri Deterding, who had succeeded Dolf's father as the director of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company. He worked for the company until 1915, when he left to look for a different job. As Joost Jonker and Jan Luiten van Zanden write in "A History of the Royal Dutch Shell", his fiancee, Elizabeth "Bep" Stoop (herself a daughter of a prominent oil explorer, Adriaan Stoop), "put his love for her to the test by asking him to choose between her and the Group." His younger brother Jean Baptiste August "Guus" Kessler Jr., who had married Bep's cousin, Anna Francoise "Ans" Stoop, continued with the Royal Dutch and eventually rose to head their father's company. 
In 1918 Dolf joined the committee for the funding of the Hoogovens ("Dutch Blast Furnaces"). In 1920 he became economical director and from 1924 on he was also the director-general. He was considered a very innovative manager, steering the company through the difficult economic environment of the Great Depression; he also believed it was necessary to provide fair wages and establish a pension plan—unusual for that time. "His drive, entrepreneurship, imagination and leadership secured Hoogovens a firm foothold in a very competitive industry at a very difficult time." Dolf and his brother Guus, as leading figures in two major Dutch business concerns, at one point formed a joint venture between the Hoogovens and Royal Dutch Shell to combat a perceived threat to the oil business by IG Farben.
Kessler would remain the director of Hoogovens until his death from a brain tumor in 1945, with a short break during the Second World War, when the Germans kept him hostage in camp Beekvliet in Sint-Michielsgestel.
Personal life.
Dolf and his wife Bep (1891–1968) had four sons and two daughters. Their home, known as Slingerduin or the Villa Kessler, was built and designed in 1929 by the prominent Dutch architect Hendrik Wouda (1885–1946), a follower of Frank Lloyd Wright. They owned of one of the few known paintings by Hercules Seghers (1589/90–1637/38)--"River Valley" (1620)--which now is displayed by the Mauritshuis Museum (Royal Picture Galley) in The Hague.
Kessler was an uncle of the Dutch diplomat and historian Max Kohnstamm (1914–2010), with whom he was interned at camp Beekvliet in Sint-Michielsgestel; they became quite close there despite the difference in age. The American journalist Glenn Kessler is one of his grandchildren.

Robert B. Shapiro

Robert B. Shapiro (born August 4, 1938 in New York City) is a businessman and attorney who has worked extensively with the biochemical corporations G.D. Searle and Monsanto Company. Before working in this sector he was Vice-President and legal counsel at General Instrument from 1972 to 1979. His father, Moses, was Chairman of this company from 1969 to 1975.
From 1979 he worked as attorney for the Illinois-based G.D. Searle & Company. In 1982 he became CEO and Chairman of the NutraSweet subsidiary. The FDA approved aspartame's use in soft drinks in November 1983, and Pepsi were among the first brands to deploy the product on a mass scale in the US.
When Searle was acquired by Monsanto in 1985, Shapiro moved up the management chain in the latter, becoming Vice President in 1990, President in 1993 and CEO in 1995. He remained CEO of Monsanto until 2000. He oversaw a period of industrial expansion, acquisitions, and consumer regulatory approval for the genetically-engineered seed businesses.
In 2000 Monsanto merged with the U.S. based pharmaceutical company Pharmacia and UpJohn to form Pharmacia Corp. Shapiro became chair of this entity until he stepped down in February 2001. Fred Hassan became CEO of Pharmacia. The agricultural business of the merged entity was later spun out of Pharmacia to form Monsanto Company, a business focused on agricultural products. Pharmacia Corporation was subsequently acquired by Pfizer.
Shapiro was a co-founder of Sandbox Industries, a Chicago-based business incubator and venture fund manager in 2003, and currently serves as one of its managing directors. 
He has a BA from Harvard University and a JD from Columbia Law School.

Scarlett (Cassidy novel)

Scarlett is a 2006 novel by Cathy Cassidy. It won the 2007 Royal Mail Award for Scottish Children's Books in the 7–11 age group. It reached number 8 in the Ottakars sales chart for children's books in June 2006. The plot revolves around the 12-year-old girl of the title, who is badly affected by the break-up of her parents. After leading a food fight at school, she is sent from London to live with her father in Ireland.
Summary.
Scarlett is a 12-year-old girl from London, is sent to live with her father and his new family in southern Ireland after being expelled from school. There, after escaping from her new school after just one day, she meets a mysterious boy called Kian who gradually reveals there is more to him than meets the eye. She slowly begins to drop her bad girl image under his influence. But when Kian leaves and her pregnant step mum Clare doesn't know what to do.
Scarlett is a troubled 12-year-old girl who acts out and has attended five schools. She had a brilliant life up until she was 10 years old when her father left them to go live in Ireland with his new partner Clare and her nine-year-old daughter Holly. This affects Scarlett deeply and with encouragement from her mother, grows very angry at her dad, tearing up birthday cards and various other presents given to her from him.
Scarlett acts out a lot in school and after her third suspension from Greenhall Academy, she is permanently excluded, due to her causing a riot in the school cafeteria, insulting dinner ladies and throwing food around. Her mother is extremely disappointed and tells her she has no other choice but to send her to live with her father. Scarlett protests, throws things, shouts, but her mother stands her ground and sends her away.
Scarlett is determined to be as bad as possible when she gets there, to scare them and show her dad she has changed big time and how much his leaving has affected her. Her mother asks her not to tell her dad that she got her tongue pierced but Scarlett shows every intention of doing so.
Her father collects her from Knock Airport and she is set on not talking to him at all but in the car, breaks this silence accidentally. Her father persists in talking to her, being friendly and apologising but Scarlett will not accept any of what he is saying.
When they get to the cottage, Scarlett discovers something very unexpected – Clare, her stepmother, is pregnant. Clare's daughter, Holly – Scarlett's stepsister – is a very bubbly and friendly nine-year-old, chatting to Scarlett, although she does not exactly get a very enthusiastic response.
For school the next day, Scarlett avoids it by pretending she forgot her pencil case and purposefully missing the bus she was supposed to take with Holly. Her father catches her in the house, however, and drives her to the school, very disappointed in her. Scarlett gets upset doing an Irish worksheet about "Mo Chlann", or "My Family". She climbs out of the window and walks for miles, eventually being rescued by Kian, a boy of about 13 or 14, on a black horse named Midnight. Scarlett's father tells her she is going to be home schooled, at least for the time being. She enjoys this as she gets to study at the lough, talking to Kian, drawing the different plants and naming them in different languages. She is progressing well and settling in with her new family.
Kian's father and uncle come looking for him but Scarlett tells them she doesn't know Kian. She tells Kian and apologises and he accepts but says he will have to go back – he ran away after his mother died of cancer. They arrange to say goodbye at one o'clock down at the lough.
The summer holidays have started and Holly asks Scarlett to pierce her nose. Scarlett refuses but when she blackmailed by Holly (Holly says she will tell Scarlett's father about the real reason why she went down to the lough so often – Kian) she agrees. Holly jumps at the last minute and the pin they were using slips, piercing a hole in Holly's lip by mistake.
Holly is taken to hospital and gets stitches and the adults are very disappointed in Scarlett although for once, she apologises for her actions. The next day, Holly and Chris, Scarlett's dad, head up to Galway for a dentist's appointment and to deliver handmade soap that Clare makes for a living. Scarlett helps Clare with her soap while Holly and Chris are gone and then Scarlett offers to contribute something towards Clare's quilt that she is making for the new baby – all the family put in a piece of their own clothing to stitch in. They go up to the attic and Scarlett discovers her father kept all her old dresses and toys although he was meant to throw them away.
Meanwhile, a lightning storm has started up and thunderous noises make them go back downstairs. On the way down the ladder, there is a blackout and Clare screams and falls down. After waking her up, Scarlett discovers Clare is in labour. She runs to the lough for Kian's help as it is just approaching the time they had set to say goodbye – one o'clock. He is nowhere to be seen but on her way back to the cottage she finds two American tourists who drive them to the hospital and let Scarlett use their mobile phone to call Scarlett's father and inform him of the recent events. Clare has a long labour and the baby is premature so is put in an incubator, to be on the safe side. They decide on a baby name: Hazel.
Scarlett decides that she should go back home to London and is happy there at last.

Nicolas Ernault de Rignac Des Bruslys

Nicolas Ernault de Rignac Des Bruslys (7 August 1757, Brive-la-Gaillarde – 25 September 1809, Saint-Denis, Réunion) was a French general, later governor of Île Bonaparte (now Réunion).
Biography.
Early career.
Des Bruslys joined the École des Mineurs in Verdun on 28 September 1774. The school was closed the next year, and he joined the elite "gardes du corps du roi", in the Noailles company. He received a commission of second lieutenant at the 3rd Artillery regiment on 4 July 1780.
In 1781, Des Bruslys took part in an attempt at invading India. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 September 1783, and to captain of the Colonial troops on 7 Mai 1786. He took part in a diplomatic mission to Persia before returning to France in 1787.
From 27 January 1788, he served as aid to the inspector of the artillery. In September, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. On 14 September, he distinguished himself at Croix-aux-Bois, reforming disbanded battalions and disengaging four battalions which were threatened to be surrounded. On the next day, he saved the supplies of his army which were being attacked by three squadrons.
On 8 October 1789, he was promoted to "Adjudant-général-colonel", and took part in the siege of Namur, personally leading the capture of the fort of Vilatte. On 26 November, he was wounded by a shrapnel at the right arm.
Revolutionary wars.
From 26 January 1793, he directed siege works at Maastricht, where he was wounded by a cannonball at the right leg on 27 February 1794.
On 7 August 1794, Des Bruslys was promoted to acting Général de brigade, and served as de facto chief of staff of the armies of the North, of Belgium and of Ardennes. His rank was confirmed on 13 May, but revoked on 10 August, and arrested shortly thereafter on suspicion raised by the defection of this brothers, in 1791. He was released at the Thermidorian Reaction, on 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794). On 22 Thermidor (9 August), he was again arrested as former head of staff of Custine. He was freed on 19 Frimaire an III (9 December 1794) and affected to the West Army. 
Des Bruslys was soon called back to Paris, and defended the Convention nationale during the Prairial uprising.
On 26 Germinal (15 April 1795), he was sent to the Army of the North. From 25 pluviôse an V (13 February 1797), he was in charge of defending the coast.
On 28 Messidor an VI (16 July 1798), he was sent to the Army of England, which he quit to take back his previous position on 21 nivôse an VII (10 January 1799). He was affected to the Army of the Rhine on 26 frimaire an VIII (17 December 1799), where he distinguished himself at Fribourg and Biberach an der Riß. He served under Jean Victor Marie Moreau at Ulm, and defended St. Gotthard Pass.
In Vendémiaire an X (October 1801), he took command of the Souham division, before being put at the disposal of the Ministry of the Navy. On 25 Nivôse (15 January 1802), he was sent to Rochefort, embarked aboard the frigate "Thêmis", and sailed to Île de France (now Mauritius), under François-Louis Magallon. He married there.
When Magallon was sent back to France, Decaen made his governor of Réunion. On 4 germinal an XII (25 March 1804), he received the Legion of Honour, and on 13 juillet 1808, he was promoted to Général de division.
Raid on Saint Paul and suicide.
Decaen had thought that the British would attempt a raid at Saint Paul. Des Brulys both did not share the conviction, and was reluctant to weaken the defences of Saint-Denis, thinking that his forces did not allow him to effectively defend the entire coastline.
The British did attack at Saint Paul, on 21 September 1809. Unable to hold their position, the French retreated near the gunpowder store. Corbett himself showed up with an ultimatum threatening to set the entire city on fire, should the French attack. 
On the next day, Des Bruslys led his force of 50 soldiers and 800 militiamen of the National Guard to counter the British, and found himself facing a 900-man strong expeditionary force already settled in Saint Paul. Des Bruslys hesitated between a direct assault and a defence line to contain the British. In the evening, he retreated to Saint-Denis in order to organise its defence against a potential invasion, leaving captain Saint-Michel to negotiate with the British.
On 23, a capitulation act was written at Saint Paul, which Des Bruslys refused to sign. At the same time, General Soleille threatened him with the decree of 14 pluviôse An II, which made "cowardice on the battlefield" punishable by the death penalty, should he not order an assault. Wanting neither to surrender, nor to order an assault which he deemed would end in a needless bloodbath, he redacted a note stating:
Des Bruslys then attempted to kill himself with his sabre, but failed. He then tried to blow his head off by detonating two sacks of gunpowder tied to his neck, but the powder failed to explode properly, which left him severely burned. He eventually took his life by slitting his carotid with his razor.
His widow obtained a 1000-franc pension in 1811.

Complementary assets

Complementary assets are assets, infrastructure or capabilities needed to support the successful commercialization and marketing of a technological innovation, other than those assets fundamentally associated with that innovation. The term was first coined by David Teece. Key empirical studies on complementary assets were conducted by Frank T. Rothaermel.
Complementary assets are broken down into three general types:
Complementary assets, among other factors, are important for organizations wishing to commercialize and profit from an innovation.
Examples.
New biotechnology firms often lack the complementary assets to commercialize their innovations and thus form collaborative partnerships with large incumbent firms who do possess the necessary complementary assets such as manufacturing capabilities, marketing channels, brand name, etc. (Rothaermel, 2001)
RC Cola was the first firm to commercialize both diet cola and cola in a can. However, rivals Coca Cola and Pepsi soon imitated this and beat RC Cola out of the market based on their superior marketing capabilities and brand name recognition, i.e. their complementary assets (Teece 1986) .

Crab Moon

Crab Moon is a children's picture book by Ruth Horowitz and illustrated by Kate Kiesler. It was selected by the National Science Teachers Association as an Outstanding Science Trade Books for Children in 2001.
Summary.
A young child, David, follows his mother to the summer rental and is amazed at horseshoe crabs that emerge to lay their eggs. The next morning, he finds an upside down crab and he places her right-side up.
Reception.
A Kirkus Reviews review says, "Along with books such as Saviour Pirotta's Turtle Bay (1997), this conveys a respectful attitude toward sea- and shore-dwelling wildlife in an unpreachy way. Young children whose interest is piqued by David's brief encounter with such ancient, alien-looking creatures will welcome the concluding page of general horseshoe crab facts". A New York Times review says, "In Ms. Kiesler's inviting pictures, you can virtually smell the salt air. Publishers Weekly in their review said that "Horowitz's poetic descriptions are buried throughout the text as smooth as sea glass. The reader sees how "the fat, round face of the full moon wavered on the surface of the water" and "curly black seaweed was strewn on the sand, like streamers left over from a party." Kiesler's seascapes are skillfully rendered but static, trading the ethereal qualities of her Fishing for a Dream for realism. Glowing yet somber, they do little to engage readers' emotions in Daniel's mild adventure." Patricia Manning in here review for School Library Journal said that "Horowitz's quiet text reflects the moonlit awe of this ageless pattern, and Kiesler's luminous oils capture freeze-frame moments in perfect step"

Ealdgyth, daughter of Earl Ælfgar

Ealdgyth ("fl. c". 1057–1066), also Aldgyth or in modern English, Edith, was a daughter of Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia, the wife of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (d. 1063), ruler of all Wales, and later the wife and queen consort of Harold Godwineson, king of England in 1066.
Family.
Ealdgyth was the daughter of Ælfgar, who had been earl of East Anglia a number of times in the 1050s and was appointed earl of Mercia in "c". 1057, in succession of his father Earl Leofric. Ælfgar's wife Ælfgifu was probably her mother, and Eadwine, the later earl of Mercia, and Morcar, earl of Northumbria, were her brothers.
In 1055, Ælfgar was exiled on the charge of treason. He went to Ireland to muster troops and formed an alliance with Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, who had been king of Gwynedd (1039–1055) but assumed the sovereignty of all Wales in 1055. Ælfgar and Gruffudd invaded England and plundered Hereford, bringing great humiliation to Earl Ralph, who needed to call in external support to repel the invaders. When peace was made, Ælfgar resumed office before succeeding his father as earl of Mercia in "c". 1057.
Marriages and issue.
Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.
It was presumably in the year of her father's appointment ("c". 1057) that Ealdgyth married his political ally, King Gruffudd ap Llywelyn. William of Jumièges describes her as a woman of considerable beauty. Walter Map also wrote of a beautiful lady much beloved by the king and so he may have had Ealdgyth in mind. On her marriage, she was given a modest amount of land in England, though the only estate which can be certainly identified as having belonged to her is one at Binley, Warwickshire. She bore the king a daughter called Nest. Nest later became the wife of Osbern fitz Richard, a marcher lord on the Herefordshire border, who acquired Binley. Nest and Osbern had a daughter who married Bernard de Neufmarché, also a marcher lord. The chronicles also record two of Gruffudd's sons, Maredudd and Ithel, probably for Idwal, who died in 1069, and a third son may be Owain ap Gruffudd (d. 1059).
The alliance between Ealdgyth's father and husband was of great significance in resisting the growing power of the Godwinesons. On the death of Earl Ralph in 1057, Hereford was added to Harold's earldom. The following year, Ælfgar was outlawed for a second time, but he was restored to office before long. Ælfgar is last heard of in 1062 and seems to have died by 1063, when Harold Godwineson invaded Wales. Gruffudd was killed in the event.
Harold Godwinson.
Ealdgyth later became the wife and queen consort of her late husband's enemy Harold. The date of the marriage is unknown, but it must have taken place at some stage before the Conquest, whether before or after Harold's coronation as king of England (January 1066). It seems that Harold's choice of bride was "aimed not only at securing the support of the Mercian house for himself in his royal ambitions, but also at weakening the links between that same house and the rulers of north Wales". In any event, Ealdgyth was soon to be widowed for a second time. In October that year, Harold was defeated and died in the Battle of Hastings, which was fought against the invading forces of William, Duke of Normandy, who would subsequently ascend the English throne. At the news of Harold's death, Ealdgyth's brothers went to London to fetch her and immediately sent her to Chester for shelter. It is unknown what happened to her thereafter. Harold had a number of children with his common law wife Edith the Fair, but his marriage to Ealdgyth may not have produced any offspring. It has been suggested that Ealdgyth may have been the mother of Harold's son Harold, but this possibility is not universally accepted. 
In fiction.
Edith is the main character in the historical romance "The Wind From Hastings", which was written by Morgan Llywelyn, and published in 1978.
Eadgyth's story is told in 'Peaceweaver', a novel by Judith Arnopp published in November 2009.

The Loser

The Loser is a novel by Thomas Bernhard, originally published in German in 1983.
Plot introduction.
The novel does not take place at the time of the events recounted, but at the time its narrator recalls them. There are three main characters: the narrator (who is the only survivor), Glenn Gould, who died a natural death at fifty-one, and Wertheimer who committed suicide some time later. The novel consists almost entirely of recollections and ruminations relating to the relationships between the three. Wertheimer and the narrator were students in a piano class taught by Vladimir Horowitz at the Mozarteum in Salzburg in 1953, where they met a young Canadian piano prodigy (Gould).
Plot summary.
In Mozarteum in Salzburg in 1953 the main characters met a young Canadian prodigy who played the Goldberg Variations miraculously and who, they quickly came to realize, was a greater pianist than even their teacher—indeed, "the most important piano virtuoso of the century," as the narrator puts it in the novel's opening sentence.
The encounter with Gould affects both characters decisively for almost three decades, as they experience an endless series of personal and intellectual travails. In fact, Gould’s talent triggers the suicidal tendencies of his two colleagues: so great is the impact of Gould's genius on the other two that, even as it nourishes them, it destroys them: they realize that Gould represents an artistic ideal to which they cannot hope to aspire. So the narrator eventually decides to give up the piano in favour of philosophy, and spends much of his subsequent time composing a rambling, never-completed essay entitled "About Glenn Gould". Wertheimer, who had been a very promising virtuoso himself, follows suit, abandoning music and moving into the "human sciences", the meaning of which is left vague. Eventually, Wertheimer behaviour becomes more and more erratic and self-destructive; he alienates all his friends, and tyrannises his devoted sister. It was Gould who, with his "ruthless and open, yet healthy American-Canadian manner" first called Wertheimer, to his face, "The Loser" ("Der Untergeher"—a much more evocative word, "lit." "the one who goes under"). As Wertheimer comes to see the accuracy of this epithet, he gradually loses his grip on life.
Allusions to actual events.
Bernhard and Gould never met in real life; however, Gould did play twice in Salzburg: the Bach D Minor Concerto with Mitropoulos on 10 August 1958, and a Sweelinck-Schoenberg-Mozart-Bach recital on 25 August 1959.
Narrative style.
The novel is written in the form of a continuous first person interior monologue, with no paragraph indentations and a high number of run-on sentences, obsessive repetitions, odd and unexplained uses of italics, and alienating leaps (without transition) from verb tense to verb tense.

Marcel Desoutter

André Marcel Desoutter (31 January 1894–13 April 1952) was an English aviator, who lost a leg in an early flying accident, but went on to a successful career in the aviation industry.
Early life.
Desoutter was one of six children of Louis Albert Desoutter, an immigrant French watchmaker, and Philomène Duret. Along with his four brothers, Rene, Charles, Louis and Robert, Marcel trained as a watchmaker.
Aviation career.
Learning to fly with the Blériot Company at their Hendon works, he passed the flying tests at the age of 17, but could not receive his licence until he was 18, receiving Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate no. 186 on 27 February 1912. He became an instructor, test and demonstration pilot.
Desoutter's accident occurred at the London Aviation Meeting held at Hendon Aerodrome at Easter 1913: whilst flying his 50-h.p. Gnome-Blériot on the afternoon of 23 March, the control stick slipped from his hand and the Blériot dived into the ground at the edge of the aerodrome. Desoutter's leg was badly broken, and later had to be amputated above the knee.
He was fitted with the standard wooden leg, but his younger brother Charles used his knowledge of aircraft materials to design a new jointed Duralumin alloy leg of half the weight, with which he was able to return to flying.
In 1914 the pair formed a company, Desoutter Brothers Limited, at 73 Baker Street, London, to manufacture the legs. The firm expanded greatly during and after the First World War, and moved to The Hyde, Hendon in 1924, where they manufactured both artificial limbs and the pneumatic portable power tools which had been developed initially as a sideline.
Marcel married Margaret F. Rust in 1918; they had three children.
Marcel Desoutter left the business in 1928 and formed the Desoutter Aircraft Company Ltd. at Croydon to build the Dutch Koolhoven F.K.41 three-seat monoplane, renaming it as the Desoutter I.
41 of this type and the improved Desoutter II were produced, but the business folded in 1932 after its main customer, National Flying Services at London Air Park, Hanworth, went into liquidation.
In 1935 Desoutter became a partner with Morris Jackaman in Airports, Ltd., which had been set up to develop Gatwick and Gravesend aerodromes as airports, and was still managing director of the company when he died at his home in Horley, Surrey on 13 April 1952.

LZ 3

__NOTOC__
The Zeppelin LZ 3 was a German experimental airship constructed in Friedrichshafen under the direction of Ferdinand von Zeppelin. It was first flown on 9 October 1906 and was later purchased by the German Army and operated as Z I until being retired in 1913. Before being purchased by the Army, LZ 3 made many flights and carried a number of influential passengers, including the German Crown Prince. 
Design and development.
The design of LZ 3 closely followed that of its predecessor, the LZ 2. The hull framework was of identical layout and size and the same engines and propellers were used, although the volume of lifting gas was increased. LZ 2 had shown severe pitch instability, and LZ 3 was fitted with two pairs of biplane elevators, one set in front of the forward gondola and the second behind the rear gondola, and fixed biplane horizontal stabilisers at the rear of the hull.
Following the first flights in 1906 some modifications were made: the triangular section keel between the gondolas was extended fore and aft, the biplane elevators were replaced by two sets of quadruple elevators mounted at either end of the cylindrical section of the hull and the rudders were mounted between the tips of the horizontal stabilisers.
After the destruction of LZ 4 it was extensively rebuilt, with the addition of an extra bay increasing its length by 8 m (26 ft 6 in) and gas capacity to 12,888 cu&nbp;m (430,800 cu ft). A large vertical fin was added above the stern of the hull and new engines, each providing 105 hp (78 kW) were fitted, giving a maximum speed of (27.5 mph)
Operational history.
LZ 3 was first flown on 9 October 1906, when a successful flight was made lasting 2 hours 17 minutes and carrying eleven people. A second shorter flight was made the next day, following which it was deflated and laid up for the winter. These flights caused a reevaluation of Zeppelin's work on the part of the German government, and a grant of 500,000 marks was made to him. However it was stipulated that an acceptance flight lasting 24 hours would have to be completed before any airship could be bought by the Government: realising that LZ 3 was incapable of meeting this requirement, work was started on the LZ 4. Following modifications to the control surfaces LZ 3 was next flown on 24 September 1907, when it made a flight lasting 4 hours 17 minutes, and a series of successful flights was made in the following days, including one on 30 September lasting 7 hours 54 minutes during which it was flown over land for the first time, flying north as far as Ravensburg. During this flight some difficulty in managing the aiship due to the up and downdraughts produced by the hilly terrain was experienced. On 8 October a brief flight was made with Crown Prince William, the heir to the throne, on board and the airship was then deflated for the winter. On 14 December the floating hangar broke loose from its moorings during a storm and was driven ashore, severely damaging LZ 3. 
Following the destruction of LZ 4, LZ 3 was repaired and enlarged. It was reinflated on 21 October 1908 and a series of short test flights were made between 23 and 26 October. On 27 October a flight lasting 5 hours 55 minutes was made with the Kaiser's brother, Admiral Prince Heinrich, on board and on 7 November, with Prince William as a passenger, it was flown 80 km (50 mi) to Donaueschingen, where the Kaiser was then staying. In spite of poor weather conditions, the flight succeeded: two days later LZ 3 was officially accepted by the Government and on 10 November Zeppelin was rewarded with an official visit to Friedrichshafen by the Kaiser, during which Zeppelin was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle.
The renamed Z I's military crew and ground staff, commanded by Major Sperling, arrived at Friedrichshafen in March 1909 to begin training. In June it was flown to Metz, where it was stationed until being broken up as obsolete in March 1913.

Uganda Landmine Survivors Association

The Uganda Landmine Survivors Association is composed of district-level survivor groups across the country and other like minded NGOs and stakeholders whose mandate include addressing landmine related issues, support to landmine survivors and other persons with disabilities, including survivor groups in Apac, Lira, Gulu, Kasese, Kitgum, Oyam and Pader. There are 2,039 estimated victims of antipersonnel mines living in Uganda.
Contamination throughout Uganda.
Decades of violence and incivility have forced some 1.8 million people to leave their homes in Northern Uganda. Since 2006, the landlocked African nation has been negotiating a peace deal with the Lord's Resistance Army, a rebel group known for terrorizing the Acholi and Lango people of the North through child-abductions, mutilation, massacre and sexual enslavement. 
There is also significant contamination in the Western region of Uganda, stemming from conflict on the Congolese border.
Despite improving political conditions, however, landmine survivors continue to face serious injustices daily in Uganda, including inadequate medical support and inability to find sufficient employment or food. Moreover, victims are often shunned by their families for fear of becoming a burden.
While the landmine problem in Uganda is less severe than countries like Angola, Mozambique and Afghanistan, the nature of the weapon has made it difficult to overcome. According to Ugandan officials, there are more than 350 suspected hazardous areas in the country, of which 153 are Kitgum; 91 in Gulu; 61 in Amuru and 57 in Kasese.

The Stadio Franco Ossola (also called Luigi Ganna Velodrome) is a sports stadium and velodrome currently in use by the football team A.S. Varese 1910.
Constructed in 1925, and originally named the "Stadio del Littorio", the stadium was renamed in September 1950 in memory of Franco Ossola, an Italian from Varese and player for Torino F.C. who died in 1949 in the Superga air disaster.
The cycling track was used for the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in 1971 and is named after Luigi Ganna, the winner of the first Giro d'Italia in 1909, who was born in nearby Induno Olona.
Originally, the stadium could accommodate up to 23,000 spectators, but the capacity has been reduced to comply with safety standards, so much so that now the north stand, which houses the home fans, is not usable. 
In recent years, plans have been drawn up to create a new 10,000 seater stadium to replace the existing one.

<doc id="20054331" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20054331" title="Legacy of the Battle of the Alamo">
Legacy of the Battle of the Alamo

The Battle of the Alamo left a substantial legacy and influence within American culture.
Perception.
Within weeks of the battle, it began to be compared to the Greek stand at the Battle of Thermopylae.
Efforts to preserve the Alamo have largely been an Anglo-American cause. The first major calls to restore parts of the Alamo occurred after 1860, as English-speaking settlers began to outnumber those of Mexican heritage. Likewise, according to Schoelwer, within "the development of Alamo imagery has been an almost exclusively American endeavor", focusing more on the Texian defenders with less emphasis given to the Mexican army or the Tejano soldiers who served in the Texian army. Many Tejanos viewed the Alamo as more than just a battlesite. They or their ancestors had experienced the benefits of the Alamo complex when it served as a mission, a hospital, or a military post. Americans had arrived in Texas much later, when the Alamo no longer served in those roles, and they tended to see the complex solely in relation to the battle. According to author Richard R. Flores, in the early 20th century the Alamo was perceived by many in the majority white population of Texas as a symbol of white supremacy over the minority Mexican population. This symbolism followed the late 19th century to early 20th century development of a new capitalist system in Texas that placed whites at the top of the social ladder as profit earners and Mexicans at the bottom of the social ladder as wage earners.
In Mexico, perceptions of the battle have often mirrored those of Santa Anna. Initially, reports of the Mexican victory concentrated on glorifying Santa Anna, especially among newspapers that supported the centralist cause. Typical headlines included, "Immortal Glory to the Illustrious General Santa Anna: Eternal Praise to the Invincible Army of Mexico". Within days of the news, people began composing patriotic marching songs about Santa Anna and his victory at the Alamo. Santa Anna's political opponents were displeased that the focus had shifted to him; within days newspapers supporting the federalist viewpoint began questioning whether the victory had come at too great a cost, and whether it would actually help Mexico. Many of the newspapers were disenchanted with Santa Anna's deployment of General Martin Perfecto de Cos, who had been paroled back to Mexico after the Siege of Bexar on the condition that he no longer take up arms against Texians.
On April 27, 1836, Mexican Secretary of War José María Tornel announced that Mexican soldiers who participated in the campaign to retake Texas would be eligible to receive a special medal; to commemorate the battle of the Alamo, the establishment date for the program was retroactively set to March 6, 1836. Within weeks, however, the Mexican government learned of Santa Anna's defeat and capture at the Battle of San Jacinto; the medal program was immediately cancelled. The Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican-American War of the 1840s.
In the 1960s, the battle was often used as a historical parallel to the Vietnam War. United States President Lyndon Johnson, whose father had authored the 1905 legislation that allowed the state of Texas to buy the long barracks, often compared the war to the Alamo. He remarked once that his decision to send more troops to Southeast Asia was "Just like the Alamo, somebody damn well needed to go to their aid." These remarks, and other similar ones, prompted a strong anti-Alamo backlash in the United States. The "New York Times" editorialized that "If Americans must remember the Alamo, let's remember that gallant men died needlessly in that old mission and that their sacrifice led eventually to a war that reflects little credit on the United States. ... To persevere in folly is no virtue. To dare to retreat from error can be the highest form of courage." In the late 1960s and early 1970s numerous anti-war protests were held on the grounds of the Alamo.
Alamo Mission.
Following the Mexican victory at the Battle of the Alamo, Mexican troops quartered in the Alamo Mission. As the Mexican army retreated from Texas following the Battle of San Jacinto, they tore down many of the walls and burned the palisade which Crockett had defended. Within the next several decades, various buildings in the complex were torn down, and in 1850 the United States Army added a gable to the top of the chapel. Speculation is that the gable was originally at Mission San José, due to its presence at that mission in 1846-48 sketches, and its absence in later images. Today, the remnants of the Alamo are in Downtown San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas. The church building remains standing and serves as an official state shrine to the Texian defenders. As the 20th century began, many Texans advocated razing the remaining building, the Long Barrack. A wealthy rancher's daughter, Clara Driscoll, purchased the building to serve as a museum. The Texas Legislature later bought the property and appointed the Daughters of the Republic of Texas as permanent caretakers. In front of the church, in the center of Downtown San Antonio's Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph, designed by Pompeo Coppini and erected in 1939, which commemorates the Texians who died during the battle. According to Bill Groneman's "Battlefields of Texas", the Alamo has become "the most popular tourist site in Texas".
Literature.
Many of the Mexican officers who participated in the battle left memoirs, although some were not written until decades after the battle. Among those who provided written accounts of the battle were Antonio López de Santa Anna, Vicente Filisola, José Enrique de la Peña, José Juan Sánchez Navarro, Juan N. Almonte, and Francisco Becerra. Texians Juan Seguín and John Sutherland also left memoirs, although some historians believe Sutherland was not at the Alamo and wrote his memoirs from hearsay. Of the Texian survivors, more weight was given to the account of Susannah Dickinson, the only American adult to live. The other survivors, including former slaves and several Tejanos, were not lauded as much as Dickinson.
The first report of the names of the Texian victims of the battle came in the March 24, 1836 issue of the "Telegraph and Texas Register". The 115 names on the list came from John Smith and Gerald Navan, who had left as couriers. In 1843 former Texas Ranger and amateur historian John Henry Brown wrote and published the first history of the battle, a pamphlet called "The Fall of the Alamo". He followed this in 1853 with a second pamphlet called "Facts of the Alamo, Last Days of Crockett and Other Sketches of Texas". No copies of the pamphlets have survived. The next major treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter's "The Fall of the Alamo", originally published in 1860 and republished in "The Magazine of American History" in 1878. Potter based his work on interviews with many of the survivors of the Battle of the Alamo. One of the most used secondary sources about the Alamo is Amelia W. Williams's doctoral dissertation, "Critical Study of the Siege of the Alamo and of the Personnel of Its Defenders". Completed in 1931, it attempted to positively identify all of the Texians who died during the battle. Her list was used to choose the names carved into the cenotaph memorial in 1936. Several historians, including Thomas Ricks Lindley, Thomas Lloyd Miller, and Richard G. Santos, believe her list included men who had not died at the Alamo. Despite the errors in some of her work, Williams collected a large amount of information and her work serves as a starting point for many historians. The first full-length, non-fiction book covering the battle was not published until 1948, when John Myers Myers' "The Alamo" was released. Since then, a littany of books have followed, most notably Walter Lord's seminal work in 1961, "A Time to Stand".
As the 19th century progressed, the battle began to appear as a plot device in many novels. In 1869, novelists Jeremiah Clemens and Bernard Lile wrote fictionalized accounts of the battle. Novelist Amelia Barr produced her own fictional version, "Remember the Alamo", in 1888. In her book, "Alamo Images", Susan Pendergrast Schoelwer noted that in these early novels "the Alamo passages seem almost incidental to the main plot, included perhaps as a means of attracting interest and encouraging sales".
Art.
The first artistic depiction of the battle came in 1838 in John Milton Niles's "History of South America and Mexico". In Schoelwer's opinion, the scenes "bore absolutely no resemblance to the original". These and other early paintings often depicted buildings that looked nothing like the Alamo and battles that occurred very differently than the 1836 battle at the Alamo. However, their presence and popularity increased the Alamo's fame, and likely contributed to the early waves of tourism at the battle site.
Film.
According to Todish "et al.", "there can be little doubt that most Americans have probably formed many of their opinions on what occurred at the Alamo not from books, but from the various movies made about the battle." The first film version of the battle appeared in 1911, when Gaston Melies directed "The Immortal Alamo", which has since been lost. Through the next four decades several other movies were released, variously focusing on Davy Crocket, Almeron Dickinson, and Louis Rose. The Alamo achieved prominence on television in 1955 with "Walt Disney's Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier", which was largely based on myth. In the early 1950s John Wayne began developing a film based on the Battle of the Alamo. When he left his contract with Republic Pictures he was forced to leave behind a partial script. Republic Pictures had the script finished and developed into the 1955 movie "The Last Command". Although the film had its historical inaccuracies, it was the most detailed of the films on the Texas Revolution. Wayne continued to develop an Alamo movie, resulting in the 1960 film "The Alamo", starring Wayne as Davy Crockett. Although screenwriter James Edward Grant claimed to have done extensive historical research, according to Todish "there is not a single scene in "The Alamo" which corresponds to an historically verifiable incident", and historians J. Frank Dobie and Lon Tinkle demanded that their names be removed from the credits as historical advisors. The movie was banned in Mexico. The set built for the movie, Alamo Village, includes a replica of the Alamo Mission and the then-Mexican city of San Antonio and is still used as an active movie set.
As the 150th anniversary of the battle approached in the 1980s, several additional movies were made about the Alamo, including the made-for-television movie "", which Nofi regards as the most historically accurate of all Alamo films. The movie Todish calls "the best theatrical film ever made about the Alamo" was also filmed in the 1980s. Filmed in IMAX format using historical reenactors instead of professional actors, "Alamo ... The Price of Freedom" is shown only in San Antonio, with several viewings per day at a theater near the Alamo. It runs only 45 minutes but has "an attention to detail and intensity that are remarkable". In 2004 another film, also called "The Alamo", was released. Described by CNN as possibly "the most character-driven of all the movies made on the subject", the movie starred Billy Bob Thornton as Crockett, Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston, and Jason Patric as Bowie. However, the film, with its revisionist viewpoint of the siege and the reasons for it, was one of the year's biggest box office failures. In "Pee-wee's Big Adventure", Pee-wee Herman's stolen bike is said by a fortune teller to be in the basement of the Alamo, but during a tour of the structure he is told by the tour guide that the Alamo has no basement.
Music.
A number of songwriters have also been inspired by the Battle of the Alamo. Tennessee Ernie Ford's "The Ballad of Davy Crockett" spent 16 weeks on the country music charts, peaking at number 4 in 1955. Marty Robbins recorded a version of the song "The Ballad of the Alamo" in 1960 which spent 13 weeks on the pop charts, peaking at number 34. "Remember the Alamo", written by Texas folk singer and songwriter Jane Bowers, was recorded by The Kingston Trio, Johnny Cash, Tex Ritter, Donovan and others.

Trunki

Trunki is a ride-on hand luggage suitcase for children, designed by Rob Law. The product rose to prominence after being featured on the UK television series "Dragons' Den" in 2006,
and has won over 50 product and design awards, including several from Design Week, Mother and Baby, D & AD, Right Start, Practical Parenting and Nick Jr.
History.
Inventor Rob Law MBE came to public attention in 2006 following an appearance on BBC2's "Dragons' Den" programme in which panellist, Theo Paphitis, tugged and broke the strap of a sample Trunki. Dragon Richard Farleigh then made an offer of £100,000 for 50% of the company, an offer which Law rejected.
Magmatic (the company which owns the Trunki brand) has sold more than 1,300,000 Trunki suitcases in 1,564 stores in 62 countries (as of June 2012), through retailers including John Lewis, Harrod's, and Next since 5 May 2006. 
More than 500 articles have appeared about Trunki in the British media and several television programmes have since featured Rob Law, including "Working Lunch", "Beat the Boss", "This Morning" and "GMTV". In June 2011 the Trunki BoostApak was featured on BBC 1's "The Apprentice. It was taken to France for contestants to see and broke the record for boardroom orders with an order of €214,000. Following this BoostApak saw a 300% increase in sales.
On Saturday 30 August 2008, Duncan Bannatyne appeared on ITV's "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" programme and when asked by presenter Chris Tarrant "Is there a sort of classic of one you've missed," replied, "There is one, a little suitcase on wheels... every time I go to an airport I see one or two of these of these... it's the only one we missed out on I think."
The registered design of the Trunki is registered as a Community Design and was recently successfully enforced against the 'Kiddee Case' copycat product. 
Trunki is distributed in the Americas through a licensing deal with toy company Melissa and Doug. Their version is manufactured in Connecticut, New England.
Made in the UK.
As of May 5th 2012, the company's 6th Birthday, Trunki expanded their production into the UK. The first Trunki to roll off the production line was the Team GB Trunki, and by the end of 2012 it is claimed all Trunki suitcases sold in the UK will have been made there too. All UK made cases will be stamped "Made in England".
Product Range.
Since launching their ride-on suitcase in 2006 Trunki have expanded their product offering to include the following ranges:

Kazue Shōda

Shōda was born in Matsuyama Domain, Iyo Province, as the 5th son of a poor "samurai". The famous poet Masaoka Shiki and admiral Akiyama Saneyuki were his friends from childhood. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1895, and obtained a position at the Ministry of Finance. In 1915, he rose to the position of director of the Bank of Chosen. He was appointed Finance Minister under the Terauchi and Kiyoura administrations, and Education Minister under the Tanaka administration. In 1938, he was considered for the post of Home Minister under the 2nd Konoe administration, a somewhat surprising choice, given his age and lack of experience in the Home Ministry, and the nomination was rejected by Emperor Hirohito.

Globe sight

A globe sight is a front sight component used to assist the aiming of a gun/device, usually those intended to launch projectiles, such as firearms, airguns, and crossbows. It is found in particular as a front sight element on rifles.
To obtain a usable sighting line the diopter has to have a complementing rear sight element.
Diopter and globe sighting lines are commonly used in ISSF match rifle shooting events.
Globe front sight.
The globe front sight consists of a hollow cylinder with a threaded cap, which allows differently shaped interchangeable front sight elements to be used. Most common are posts of varying widths and heights or rings or holes of varying diameter — these can be chosen by the shooter for the best fit to the target being used. Tinted transparent plastic insert elements may also be used, with a hole in the middle; these work the same way as an opaque ring, but provide a less obstructed view of the target. High end target front sight tunnels normally also accept accessories like adjustable aperture and optical systems to ensure optimal sighting conditions for match shooters. Some high end target sight line manufacturers also offer front sights with integrated aperture mechanisms.
Complementing rear sight element.
The complementing rear sight element may be an open type iron sight or an aperture sight as used in ghost rings and target aperture sights such as a target shooting diopter sight.
Diopter and globe sighting line principle.
The use of round rear and front sighting elements for aiming at round targets, like used in ISSF match shooting, takes advantage of the natural ability of the eye and brain to easily align concentric circles (circles all having a common centre).
For optimal aiming and comfort the shooter should focus the aiming eye on the front sighting element. To avoid eye fatigue and improve balance the non-aiming eye should be kept open. The non-aiming eye can be blocked from seeing distractions by mounting a semi-transparent occluder to the diopter.
Even for the maximum precision, there should still be a significant area of white visible around the bullseye and between the front and rear sight ring (if a front ring is being used). Since the best key to determining center is the amount of light passing through the apertures, a narrow, dim ring of light can actually be more difficult to work with than a larger, brighter ring.
The precise sizes of the employed components are quite subjective, and depend on both shooter preference and ambient lighting, which is why target rifles come with easily replaceable front sight inserts, and adjustable aperture mechanisms.

Thomas Glazier

Thomas Glazier of Oxford (fl. 1386-1427) was a master glazier active in England during the late 14th and early 15th century; he is one of the earliest identifiable stained glass artists, and is considered a leading proponent of the International Gothic style.
Biography, works.
Glazier's workshops were based in Oxford, and he was clearly an important figure in the town; he is recorded in New College's Steward's Book as being regularly invited to dine with the Warden and Fellows. Although we have some record of his professional activities (and appearance; see below) almost nothing is known of his personal life, other than that he was married.
Glazier is particularly notable for his early adoption of elements of the emerging International Gothic style in his work: he may have been influenced by his contacts with European artists through William of Wykeham and his circle. His work is characterised by sophisticated draughtsmanship and placement of figures, and also by its remarkable stylistic development, indicating that such artists were open to absorbing new ideas during the course of their careers. Along with the work of John Thornton of Coventry, Glazier's style was highly influential. It is possible that Robert Lyen, who made windows for Exeter Cathedral, was his apprentice.
Glazier's work survives in the chapels of New College, Oxford and of Winchester College. The latter scheme contains an 1822 copy of a self-portrait included in the original east window: this depicts him kneeling in prayer, wearing a long gown and with a short, forked beard of the sort fashionable in the late 14th century. There is a panel probably executed by him in the church of Thenford, Northamptonshire, as well as windows in Winchester Cathedral and the chapel of Merton College, Oxford.

Confederate Memorial in Mayfield

The Confederate Memorial in Mayfield is a commemorative monument and fountain located on the courthouse lawn in downtown Mayfield, Kentucky. 
Mayfield during the Civil War was very supportive of the Confederate States of America. Before the secession of Tennessee on June 8, 1861 caused the proposal to be abandoned, representatives from seven western Kentucky counties and twenty western Tennessee counties met at Mayfield in May 1861 to discuss forming a new state that would join the Confederacy. In 1864 Union forces occupied the town and forced the townspeople to help fortify the courthouse, which was destroyed later that year. The courthouse behind the memorial fountain was built in 1889.
Mayfield's United Daughters of the Confederacy obtained the fountain in 1917 from the McNeal Marble Company in Marietta, Georgia at the cost of $1,650. The fountain, which no longer emits water, is a obelisk with wings that double as benches. On the end of the wings are light posts that are eight feet away from the center obelisk; the northern post is inscribed 1861, and the southern post 1865. The center obelisk has three different Confederate flags in copper relief on its top.
On July 17, 1997, it was one of sixty-one different monuments to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. One other monument on the list, the Confederate Memorial Gates in Mayfield, is nearby in Maplewood Cemetery, north of downtown Mayfield. Other monuments on the list that are also fountains are the Confederate Monument of Cadiz and the Confederate Memorial Fountain in Hopkinsville.

Wales Institute for Research in Art and Design

Wales Institute for Research in Art and Design (WIRAD) is a collaborative venture founded by the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff (UWIC) and University of Wales, Newport (UWN).
WIRAD seeks to support research excellence in Art & Design within Wales by sharing expertise across institutions. The Institute will create a significant body of research related to the fields of art, design and media which would be competitive with the research quality and intensity achieved by institutions in Scotland, England & Ireland.
Cardiff School of Art and Design and Newport School of Art, Media and Design have been (in various guises) major contributors to the cultural and creative life of Wales for very many years. Both have been home to a number of significant artists and designers and, more recently, nationally and internationally recognised centres of research.
WIRAD operates an "open door" policy because the institute's success is in many ways predicated on the creation of a critical mass of expertise, experience and capacity that does not currently exist. All Welsh Universities and Colleges are invited to apply for membership.
Lecture programmes and research days are held as open events to facilitate dissemination and the development of a wider research community in art and design in Wales.
Associate membership of the Institute will be developed for academics, HEIs and other research bodies with established interests in this level of research.

<doc id="20054537" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20054537" title="Papillifera papillaris">
Papillifera papillaris

Papillifera papillaris, also known as Papillifera bidens, is a species of small, air-breathing land snail with a clausilium, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Clausiliidae, the door snails. This is a Mediterranean species. 
In Britain this species is now sometimes called the "Cliveden snail" because in 2004 it was discovered in the gardens of a well-known Buckinghamshire stately home which had previously been associated with the Profumo Affair.
Based on some recent research, it appears that there is a somewhat complicated nomenclatural problem with the name of this species. Apparently the name "Turbo bidens" was not originally applied by Linnaeus to material of "this" species. See further discussion under "Nomenclature".
Nomenclature.
The ICZN opinion, number 2176, preserved the name "Turbo bidens" Linnaeus, 1758, and indicated implicitly that the name "Helix papillaris" Müller, 1774 was a junior synonym of the same species. However, at this time the meaning of the name "Turbo bidens" was not fixed with a valid type specimen designation. In 2009 Kadolsky reviewed the nomenclatural history of the name "Turbo bidens" and concluded that a neotype designation proposed by Falkner et al. (2002) was invalid because it was not based on an existing specimen but on a figure of "Papillifera papillaris" published by Gualtieri (1742), which did not agree with Linnaeus' description of "Turbo bidens", and which Linnaeus did not quote. 
Kadolsky (2009) argued that Linnaeus' brief description was consistent with the figure of Gualtieri's work (1742) which Linnaeus (1758) did quote, and fixed the meaning of the nominal species "Turbo bidens" Linnaeus, 1758 with the designation of a neotype. This is a specimen from Florence, where Gualtieri lived and where he might conceivably collected, of the clausiliid species hitherto known as "Cochlodina incisa" (Küster, 1876). However, the German malacologist Hartmut Nordsieck did not accept this interpretation. 
The main reason for this opinion, and indeed for the disagreement about the identity of Linnaeus' "Turbo bidens" since the inception of this name, is Linnaeus' description of the shell suture as "subcrenellate", which does not apply to "Cochlodina incisa". This is factually correct, except for minute crenellations which hardly deserve this name, but Nordsieck and many authors before him ignored the fact that Gualtieri's figure does actually show them. They are no doubt exaggerated, but Linnaeus accepted the figure as correct, and described his species accordingly. Kadolsky's neotype designation for "Turbo bidens" fixes the meaning of this name conclusively, and in consequence the valid name for the "Papillifera" species often named "Papillifera bidens" is "Papillifera papillaris" (Müller, 1774).
Shell description.
The shells of "Papillifera papillaris" are left-handed and extremely high-spired, with 10–11 whorls.
The width of the shell is 3.2–3.8 mm, and the height of the shell is 12–15 mm.
The genus name "Papillifera" means "bearing papules", in other words having pimples, a reference to the small white shell structures along the suture line. The papules are very noticeable in the shells of individuals in this species.
Habitat.
In most of its range, this species lives in rocky limestone habitats, and can often be found near the seashore.
Distribution.
The native range of this species is Mediterranean; it is originally native only to Italy, Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicily.
This species has been introduced and has become established throughout the Mediterranean region, including the Balearic Islands, the South of France, Albania, Malta, Croatia (Susak) and Turkey (since 330 AD or before). At least some of these introductions appear to have been accidental, on imported stonework, and may in some cases date back to the Roman occupation of these areas.
In Britain.
This snail was also accidentally introduced to southern Great Britain, more than once, and became established there. 
In 2004, the species was found in Buckinghamshire, southeastern England, in the crevices of a travertine marble and brick balustrade. This balustrade was originally constructed in Italy in about 1816, and had stood in the grounds of the Villa Borghese, in Rome. In the late 19th century the balustrade was taken from there, and was installed in the formal gardens of the country house Cliveden in 1896. Since 1942, Cliveden has been owned by the National Trust.
These small snails shelter in the many nooks and crannies of the travertine marble stonework; presumably they feed on lichens that grow on the surfaces of the stone. 
The snails at Cliveden were noticed by a specialist volunteer who was cleaning the stonework and statuary; the identity of the snail was recognized by Janet Ridout Sharpe, in a note in the 2005 "Archeo+Malacology Group Newsletter". The snails have spread from the balustrade to a red brick terrace and a stone fountain, but apparently no further than that. Although this is certainly an introduced species, it is not an invasive species.
Subsequent to the publicity surrounding this find, Chris Thain, the Reserve Manager of the Dorset Wildlife Trust, pointed out that the same species of snail was in fact already known from Brownsea Island, Dorset, in southwestern England, having been discovered 11 years earlier, in 1993, at which point the identity of the snail was confirmed by Michael P. Kerney of the British Museum. In Brownsea Island (as is also the case in Cliveden) the snails live in stonework and statuary which was imported from Italy in the late 19th century.
This species was a new addition to the snail fauna of Great Britain.

North Sea Region

The North Sea Region refers to European countries and regions bordering the North Sea. Cultural and economic co-operation have a strong tradition in the area, dating back to the Vikings and the Hanseatic League.
Although not a formally established entity, in political terms the North Sea Region is consolidated through international organisations like the North Sea Commission and transnational co-operation programmes like the North Sea Region Programme of the European Union.
Geographic area.
North Sea Commission.
The partnership of the North Sea Commission consists of most Norwegian municipalities, the regions Halland and Västra Götaland in Sweden, the three Danish regions of Nordjylland, Midtjylland and Syddanmark, parts of northern Germany, the Netherlands and north western France as well as counties and authorities from eastern England and Scotland.
North Sea Region Programme – Cooperation Area.
The North Sea Region (NSR), as defined in the Operational Programme of the North Sea Region Programme 2007–2013, covers an area of 664,000 km2. It consists of the whole of Norway and Denmark, the eastern parts of the UK, parts of the Flemish Region of Belgium, the north western regions of Germany, the northern and western parts of the Netherlands and the south western region of Sweden. Geographically, the region is connected by the large sea basin of the North Sea.
Population.
Based on the co-operation area of the North Sea Region Programme, about 60 million inhabitants (2003) live in the North Sea Region. The population density of the region varies widely, ranging from sparsely populated areas like Finnmark (1.5 inhabitants/km2) in Norway to densely inhabited urban centres like the German city of Hamburg (2,243 inhabitants/km2).
Economy.
The North Sea Region belongs to the most prosperous parts of the European Union. The average level of GDP across the region was €28,516 per capita in 2002. The unemployment rate is below the EU average in most areas. However, there are notable differences concerning economic performance and employment between the areas in the North Sea Region.
Currently, the economic structure of the regions bordering the North Sea is undergoing considerable changes, such as shrinking labour markets in the agriculture and fisheries sector and decline in old industrialised areas.

Children's Regional Planning Committee

Children's Regional Planning Committees were established in England and Wales by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security in 1970 under Section 35 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. They comprised one elected representative from each county and county borough council in the area which they covered and were funded by those same councils. There were eleven committees throughout England (North, Yorkshire and Humberside, North Western, West Midlands, East Midlands, East Anglia, Home Counties, London Boroughs, South East, Wessex, and South West) and one for Wales.
The task of these committees was to prepare development plans for a system of community children's homes in their area and to prepare schemes of "intermediate treatment" (i.e. an intermediate step to be taken before removing a child who was in trouble or at risk into care).

Clausilium

The clausilium is a calcareous anatomical structure which is found in one group of air-breathing land snails: terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Clausiliidae, the door snails. The clausilium is one part of the clausilial apparatus. 
The presence of a clausilium is the reason for the common name "door snails", because all the snails in this family have a roughly spoon-shaped "door" or clausilium, which can slide down to close the aperture of the shell. However, this structure is emphatically not the same thing as an operculum, which is virtually non-existent in pulmonate snails, only occurring in the Amphibolidae. 
The exact shape of the clausilium varies from genus to genus: it can be tongue-shaped, spoon-shaped or spatula-shaped. The wide flat end of the clausilium can close the aperture of the snail shell, and thus protect the soft parts against predation by animals such as carnivorous beetle larvae. The narrow end of the clausilium slides in a groove, which is formed by spiral folds on the inside of the shell around the columella. Because the groove is long, and the muscles that control the clausilium are also long, the whole structure can be retracted into the shell. The mechanism is totally different, but the clausilium is vaguely reminiscent of an automated garage door opener.

Winder musket

The Winder musket was a .22-caliber training rifle used by the US Army in the early 20th century.
History.
The Winder musket was the brainchild of Colonel C. B. Winder, who advocated marksmanship training with a rifle of similar size and weight to a service rifle but chambered in .22 rimfire, which was both economical and suitable for indoor ranges. The Winder musket was based on the Winchester Model 1885 single shot rifle.
Although it was never officially referred to as the Winder musket, the weapon was informally named in honor of Colonel C. B. Winder, and has since generally been referred to as the Winder musket.
Winder muskets were used for target and training purposes well into the early Twentieth Century. Many were purchased by the United States Ordnance and many were issued to American N.R.A. affiliated rifle clubs. The Winder musket was superseded by the 1922 Model bolt-action training rifle, and remaining Winder muskets were sold.
Design and Features.
The action for the Winder musket was originally developed by Browning. Winchester bought the patent and manufacturing rights from Browning in 1883.
The Winder musket featured a full stock, and was chambered for .22 Short or .22 Long Rifle. It had a 28 inch barrel and an overall weight of 8.5 lbs.
Variants.
The Winder musket was produced a "high wall" version and a "low wall" version, with the name referring to the height of the side walls of the action alongside the falling block and the hammer. There were two major high wall variants and one low wall variant.
The Winder musket was also produced in both military and civilian versions.

Gomphus pulchellus

The Western Clubtail "(Gomphus pulchellus)" is a species of dragonfly in the family Gomphidae. It is found in Western Europe, although absent in the British isles. Its natural habitat are clean ponds and canals, clay and mud holes.
The species is 47–50 mm long. It is the only Gomphidae that lacks the "club-shaped" abdomen, in spite of its name.
As an adult, it is mainly pale olive-green with blue eyes.
It emerges early in spring, and can be seen as soon as the end of March in the South of France and flies until August depending on the location.

Gomphus flavipes

The River Clubtail or Yellow-legged Dragonfly ("Gomphus flavipes") is a species of dragonfly in the family Gomphidae. It is found in Europe. Its natural habitat are rivers and large streams.
The dragonfly flies from June to September depending on the location.
Geographical distribution.
"G. flavipes" is a European species. It has the biggest geographical range among the European Gomphid species, occurring from France to eastern Siberia. The species has a very patchy occurrence in Central Europe and has become rare in Western Europe. The southernmost occurrence is known from Greece. In Southern Europe "G. flavipes" is replaced by other Gomphid species. However, the exact geographical range of the species is still unclear.
Habitat.
"G. flavipes" lives along the middle and lower reaches of slow flowing medium sized and big rivers The species prefers riverbed with mud, clay, loam or fine sand as soil, since larvae develop buried in the soil, but avoids areas with decomposition of organic matter and oxygen-poor stagnant water. Reaches with high drift and coarse substrate are also avoided, however, occasionally "G. flavipes" can be found in bigger lakes with high oxygen content.
Morphology.
As a medium sized dragonfly "G. flavipes" is 50–55 mm long and with an average wingspan of 70–80 mm. The eyes are widely separated, this is a typical genus-specific feature, males have blue while females have green eyes. Both sexes have predominantly yellow legs and the males has thin angled appendages, while his 10th segment is entirely black dorsally.
Behaviour and life cycle.
"G. flavipes", as all dragonflies, are predators; they capture smaller insect in flight.
Imagos are rarely seen, the easiest way to observe them is in the mating period or during the emergence of young adults.
Mating usually takes place in June or July. During the day adult males search for females, far from the riverbank, in low altitude above the waterfront. If they successfully catch a female copulation takes place in the shelter of water edge willows.
After fertilization females fly 20–30 cm above the water and lay eggs (one at a time or in a small packets) into the water.
Larval development.
The larvae develop for three years buried in the fine soil of the riverbed. As imagos, they are predators too, their diet consisting of small invertebrates which they capture with they specialized labium called the "mask".
The emergence of the larvae starts mostly at end of May or June, but it depends highly on location and other environmental circumstances (e.g. a rainy period could delay the start of emergence).
The emergence in "G. flavipes" is often highly synchronised and it is therefore referred as a ’summer species’, in Odonatology EM50 values are used to describe the emergence pattern (extent of synchronization). Emergence The patterns often have two peaks in "G. flavipes" due to the phenomenon called ’cohort splitting’.
Larvae of "G. flavipes", unlike other Anisoptera larvae, often choose riverbank soil as an emergence substrate, however the type of substrate depends on location and characteristics of the riverbank, probably the larvae have no substrate specific attachment.
Threat factors.
"G. flavipes" has become an endangered species in most Western European countries due to water pollution and river regulation. The species is listed in the Annex IV of Habitats Directive.

In Tanzania, the firm provided advice on strategies to meet Millennium Development Goals energy targets by 2012. A new drug, known as the Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), was available to combat malaria, but was largely inaccessible to the masses because of cost and distribution challenges. The World Bank commissioned Dalberg to design a mechanism to reduce the cost of ACTs. In November 2007, the design for the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm) was approved by the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership Board. Other projects in this sector have included designing initiatives to support people with chronic diseases in developing countries and advising pharmaceutical companies in Venezuela on profitable growth.
In 2006-2007, the President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, asked the firm to study poverty reduction. Dalberg presented Sirleaf and the Liberian Cabinet case studies of similar African countries such as Rwanda and Mozambique and highlighted the potential trade-offs that Liberia had to make to overhaul of its economy in the wake of the second civil war.

Battle of Seedaseer

The Battle of Seedaseer was a battle of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War on 6 March 1799 at Seedaseer (near present-day Siddapura, Karnataka), a hill and pass on the border of the Coorg and Mysore country seven miles from Piriyapatna and with a view almost as far as Seringapatam. A British force of 2,000 was surrounded by around 12,000 men of Tipu Sultan's forces. The latter were held off, albeit with heavy losses, until the arrival of reinforcements.
Battle.
Lieutenant-General James Stuart and the Bombay Army of 6,500 under his command advanced from Cannanore, aiming to cross the Western Ghats and converge at Seringapatam with the larger Madras Army advancing from the east. He then took up a defensive position on the Anglo-Mysore frontier to await further orders from General Harris, placing his right brigade in an advanced position at Seedaseer on 2 March so as to better receive Harris's orders. This was under Lieutenant-Colonel Montressor and was made up of what are now the 1st and 2nd Maratha Light Infantry battalions and the now-defunct 1st Bombay Pioneers. He kept his other 2 brigades, the main body of his force, at Siddapura and Ahmootenaar 8 to 12 miles from Seedaseer. 
Receiving news of a possible Mysorean march Stuart reinforced the advanced position with one more battalion of sepoys. This advance was Tipu's main force moving to destroy the Bombay Army (whilst a small Mysorean force held off the Madras Army), and reached Seedaseer at 9am on 6 March 1799. Stuart led the Left Brigade there as reinforcements by 2pm, forcing Tipu to withdraw.
The place where this battle took place was in the jagir of Nawab Subhan Khan,father of Nawab Qutub Ali Khan. This place was taken over by Government of India after Police action in 1948.
Estimation.
The Governor-General wrote in his despatches to the British East India Company's directors "I am confident that your most honourable Court will be of the opinion that the conduct and success of the Army of Bombay on that day Seedaseer has seldom been equalled and never surpassed.", and the battle's anniversary has been celebrated annually ever since as "Seedaseer Day" with regimental sports and, in the case of the 2nd Battalion, with a pageant of episodes during the battle in replicas of the 1799 uniforms.

Regency Square

Regency Square is an enclosed shopping mall in Richmond, Virginia, USA. Opened in 1975, the mall features more than 100 tenants, including four anchor stores JCPenney, Sears, and two locations of Macy's as well as a food court. The mall is currently owned by a mortgage lender and managed by Jones Lang LaSalle. It was owned and managed by Taubman Centers until 2012.
History.
Regency Square opened in 1975. At the time, its anchor stores comprised JCPenney, Sears, Miller & Rhoads and Thalhimer's. Besides the addition of a food court in 1987, the mall remained largely unchanged. After Miller & Rhoads closed in 1990, Hecht's bought the location, along with three other former Miller & Rhoads stores in Virginia, and converted it to a Hecht's. Two years later, the Thalhimer's chain was also acquired by Hecht's, and as a result, the Thalhimer's became a second Hecht's location.
Taubman Centers acquired the Regency Square mall in 1997. A children's play place was added in 2003.
Competition with other malls.
Regency Square faced additional retail competition in 2003, when two other malls opened nearby: Short Pump Town Center and Stony Point Fashion Park, the latter also a Taubman property. In 2008, it had the second-lowest vacancy rate of any shopping center in Richmond.
In January 2012, Taubman sold the mall to its mortgage lender to avoid foreclosure on the property. The lender hired Jones Lang LaSalle for management of the property.

Polly Courtney

Polly Courtney is an English author and media commentator. She is best known as the author of the novels "Golden Handcuffs" and "Poles Apart".
Background.
In her early years, Courtney was a straight-A student who spent her free time playing a multitude of sports and playing violin with various orchestras and string quartets. She grew up in London. Courtney graduated from the University of Cambridge with a first-class degree in mechanical engineering, and worked in investment banking for two years before resigning to spend time writing her first novel based on her experiences in the City. In an interview, she claimed this was due to the strenuous hours and pressures synonymous with the banking culture.
Fiction.
Courtney has written a number of novels. Her early novels, "Golden Handcuffs" and "Poles Apart", were self-published, based on her experiences as an investment banker and the story of a Polish migrant acquaintance. Her publishing success earned her a three-book publishing deal with HarperCollins imprint, Avon. At the release of "It's a Man's World" in 2011, Courtney announced plans to return to self-publishing because she did not agree with the chick lit marketing approach used by HarperCollins. On returning to self-publishing, Courtney said in an interview that she was pleased to have regained control. "Feral Youth" (2013) is based on Courtney's experiences of the London riots and her concerns that more unrest would be only a matter of time.
Non-fiction.
Courtney has written commentary pieces on city culture, women in the workplace, Polish migrants, lads' mags, sexism in publishing and youth discontentment for The Observer, The Guardian, The Independent, The Sunday Times, The Evening Standard, Female First, Grazia and Huffington Post.

In 1994, the company expanded into producing music festivals to complement their small group tours. The company pioneered this concept , and has four festivals confirmed for 2014.
Critical acclaim.
Martin Randall Travel focuses on a small clientele and has received favourable reviews. Ian Irvine in "The Independent" said, "All three... highlights from my life as a cultural tourist were part of the remarkable series of music festivals run by Martin Randall." Christine Headley praised Martin Randall Travel's handling of money - covering most costs and distributing local currency - on the festival she attended. Kenneth Asch wrote in the "Travellers' Handbook", "Of all the travel services I have researched, Martin Randall Travel is perhaps the most comprehensive, culturally speaking."

Žeje pri Komendi

Žeje pri Komendi () is a village in the Municipality of Komenda in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
The name of the settlement was changed from "Žeje" to "Žeje pri Komendi" in 1955. The name was first attested in written sources in 1322 as "Seyach" (and as "Seach" in 1348). The name is derived from the plural demonym "*Žežane", from the verb "*žeťi" 'to burn'. The change "*Žež-" > "*Žej-" is a result of dissimilation. The name refers to people living on burned-over ground. A second possibility is that the name may be derived from some unknown noun related to Slovene "žeja" 'thirst', referring to an intermittent spring or dry soil. The settlement was known as "Scheje" in 19th-century German.
Mass graves.
Žeje pri Komendi is the site of two known mass graves from the period immediately after the Second World War. The graves contain the remains of 10 to 15 prisoners from Kamnik that were murdered in May and June 1945. Their nationality and whether they were soldiers or civilians is unknown. The Kuhar Woods Mass Grave () is located near a path on the edge of a woods north of the main settlement. The Smovc Mass Grave () is located southwest of the main settlement.

Marco Kurz

Marco Kurz (born 16 May 1969 in Stuttgart) is a retired German footballer who is now a coach.
Playing career.
Kurz, who played as a defender, started playing his first football at SV Sillenbuch, a small club in his native Stuttgart, and then for VfL Sindelfingen. At age 20, he had his breakthtrough into professional football, when he signed a contract for his local Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart in the summer of 1989. After one year, where he – with the exception of one cap – only played for "VfB"'s second team, he was transferred to Franconian side 1. FC Nuremberg, in 1990; there he was more successful, earning 108 caps in four seasons. When the "Club" was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after the 1993–94 season, Kurz took up an offer by Westphalian club BV Borussia Dortmund. The "BVB" won the title of German champion in the following season, with Kurz playing four times. At BVB rivals Schalke 04, where he subsequently played from 1995 to 1998, he earned 58 caps.
With Schalke he won his biggest title, the 1996–97 UEFA Cup, under Dutch coach Huub Stevens. In 1998, he transferred to the south of Germany again, joining TSV 1860 München. He played 128 times for ""die Löwen"" (the Lions), until 2004, when the Bavarian side was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga.
2004–05 was Kurz' last season as a player. He spent it at Swabian side SC Pfullendorf, a Regionalliga Süd (then third division) team (11 caps). Shortly after joining Pfullendorf, he was promoted to player-coach; in 2005, he retired as a player, but stayed at Pfullendorf as head coach.
Managerial career.
After managing SC Pfullendorf, Kurz returned to 1860 München as a manager for the second team (Regionalliga Süd). In March 2007, he was promoted to head coach of the first team. 1860 München sacked Kurz in February 2009. Kurz joined 1. FC Kaiserslautern in June 2009. Kurz won promotion to the bundesliga for the club in 2010. The subsequent 2010–11 season was changeable and most of the time, "FCK" was threatened by relegation, but eventually the ""Red Devils"" finished a sensational seventh in the German top flight - their best finish in the bundesliga since 1998-99, when they finished fifth. 2011–12 was much worse, with Kaiserslautern occupying a relegation berth virtually all season. Therefore, Kaiserslautern parted ways with coach Kurz on 20 March 2012.
On 18 December 2012, it was announced by Bundesliga side TSG 1899 Hoffenheim that Kurz would be the new head coach for the second half of the 2012–13 season, when Hoffenheim faced the threat of relegation. Hoffenheim weren't able to emerge from the drop zone and decided to fire Kurz on 2 April 2013. Then Kurz was manager of Ingolstadt 04 between 9 June 2013 and 30 September 2013.

ASU Karsten Golf Course is a classic designed links-style golf course in Tempe, Arizona, located on the campus of Arizona State University. Designed by noted course architect Pete Dye, it opened for play in September 1989 and is the home venue of the Sun Devils golf teams.
Privately funded, the largest single contributor was Karsten Solheim (1911–2000), the founder of Phoenix-based PING golf clubs. The clubhouse and ASU players' facility
were completed in November 1994. It is located at the northeast edge of campus, among the other athletic venues at ASU, just east of Sun Devil Stadium. The elevation of the course is approximately above sea level.
Considered to many as the "Home of Champions," referring to ASU's strong collegiate golf program's national titles; twice in men's (1990 and 1996) and seven times in women's (1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2009). Alumni among PGA and LPGA Tour professionals include Phil Mickelson, Billy Mayfair, Paul Casey, Howard Twitty, Tom Purtzer, Heather Farr, Grace Park, Azahara Muñoz, and Carlota Ciganda. 
Awarded a high 4½ rating by "Golf Digest" Rating Panel, a number of holes could be considered the course’s signature hole. The short par-four 4th hole, the tough par-four 9th, the dauntingly long par-three 16th ( from the tips) or the ill humor par-four 18th which is guarded by water down the left side and is considered one of the toughest finishing holes in the state. The course has hosted tournaments, including the collegiate Men’s and Women’s Pac-10 and NCAA Championships, Phoenix Thunderbirds Collegiate Invitational, PING Invitational, and U.S. Open Qualifying.

Great Escape is the second studio album from The Rifles, which was released on January 26, 2009, after the initial release date of October 13 was delayed. The album delay was somewhat attributed to the length of time it took to record. The Rifles used two different producers, Dave McCracken and Stan "Jan" Kybert, as well as recording the album in three different locations.
The Rifles used Dave Davies' (The Kinks) Konk Studios in Crouch End, Dan Hawkins' (The Darkness) studio Leeders Farm, and "The Pool" in Miloco Studios to record the album.
The working title for the album was "The Pavement's Diaries".
The album was released in North America on September 15, 2009, through Nettwerk Music Group.
In popular culture.
"The Great Escape" was on the soundtrack to the video game "Test Drive Unlimited 2".

Joosep Laiksoo

Joosep Laiksoo (born 29 September 1990) is an Estonian rally driver. He was convicted of manslaughter after being involved in a car accident.
Car racing.
Laiksoo won the first race he entered in — the Otepää Junior Race — on 3 November 2007. Afterwards he won several Estonian rally events.
Car accident.
On 8 December 2007 afternoon, three cars crashed into each other on the 91st kilometre of Tallinn–Tartu highway, near Paide leading to death of three people; a fourth car drove out of the road to avoid crashing. The crash was caused, as was later found, by Laiksoo's Volvo XC90, driving into the opposite lane and crashing head-on into a VAZ 21063, driven by a man identified as "Heinar, born in 1930". A Seat Cordoba, driven by a man identified as "Tarmo, born in 1951", which had been driving after the VAZ then crashed into it. Heinar, Tarmo, and a female person who had been travelling in the VAZ died due to the crash. In order to avoid crashing into the crashed cars, a Renault driven by a woman identified as "Triin, born in 1982", drove off the road, suffering no significant injuries.
Laiksoo, being only 17 years old at the time of the crash, was legally required to only drive under supervision of an adult licensed driver. However, he was driving alone at the time.
Trials.
In the trial court's ruling from July 31, 2008, judge Heino-Vello Pihlak found Laiksoo guilty, and sentenced him to three years of imprisonment, suspended. The sentence was reduced by 1/3 on accord of the trial being conducted in a breve fashion. As an additional punishment, Laiksoo's driving license was revoked, non-reinstatable for one year. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 6525 EEK, the forensic expertise costs of 34855 EEK and the court costs of 371 EEK.
In its appellate review, the Tallinn district court vacated a part of the trial court's ruling, converted three months of the two-year imprisonment into a shock incarceration and extended the non-reinstatement of his driving license to three years.
Second crash.
On 12 December 2008, Laiksoo caused another car crash in Tallinn damaging a Volvo driven by Mart Seer. Since he had appealed the ruling of the Tallinn district court, his punishment that had included the three-year driving prohibition was not yet in force at the time of the crash.

<doc id="20055308" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20055308" title="Product planning">
Product planning

Product Planning is the ongoing process of identifying and articulating market requirements that define a product’s feature set.
Product planning serves as the basis for decisions about price, distribution and promotion.
Product planning is the process of creating a product idea and following through on it until the product is introduced to the market. Additionally, a small company must have an exit strategy for its product in case the product does not sell. Product planning entails managing the product throughout its life using various marketing strategies, including product extensions or improvements, increased distribution, price changes and promotions.
Phases of product planning.
Developing the product concept.
The first phase of product planning is developing the product concept. Marketing managers usually create ideas for new products by identifying certain problems that consumers must solve or various customer needs. For example, if we take a small computer retailer may see the need to create a computer repair division for the products it sells. After the product idea is conceived, managers will start planning the dimensions and features of the product. Some small companies will even develop a product mock-up or model.
Studying the market.
The next step in the product planning process is studying the competition. Most small companies will order secondary research information from vendors such as the NPD Group and Forrester Research. Secondary research usually provides details on key competitors and their market share, which is the percent of total sales that they hold in the marketplace. Some companies may also do a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats), according to NetMBA.com, which will help them compare their strengths and weaknesses against those of key competitors. The business can then determine places in which it has an advantage over the competition to identify areas of opportunity. For example, a small company with a high-quality image may be able to find additional markets for its products.
Market research.
A small company should consider doing both qualitative and quantitative marketing research for its new product. Focus groups are an example of qualitative information. Focus groups allow companies to ask their consumers about their likes and dislike of a product in small groups. A focus group allows the company to tweak the product concept before testing it through phone surveys—a more Jay-Z quantitative marketing research function. Phone surveys enables a company to test its product concept on a larger scale, the results of which are more predictable across the general population.
Product introduction.
If the survey results prove favorable, the company may decide to sell the new product on a small scale or regional basis. During this time, the company will distribute the products in one or more cities. The company will run advertisements and sales promotions for the product, tracking sales results to determine the products potential success. If sales figures are favorable, the company will then expand distribution even further. Eventually, the company may be able to sell the product on a national basis.
Product life cycle.
Product planning must also include managing the product through various stages of its product life cycle. These stages include the introduction, growth, maturity and decline stages. Sales are usually strong during the growth phase, while competition is low. However, continued success of the product will pique the interest of competitors, which will develop products of their own. The introduction of these competitive products may force a small company to lower its price. This low pricing strategy may help prevent the small company from losing market share. The company may also decide to better differentiate its product to keep its prices steady. For example, a small cell phone company may develop new, useful features on its cell phones that competitors do not have.

Bachman-Wilson House

The Bachman Wilson house, in Millstone, New Jersey was originally designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1954 for Abraham Wilson and his first wife, Gloria Bachman. Ms. Bachman's brother, Marvin, had studied with Wright at Taliesin West, his home and studio in Scottsdale, Arizona. 
The front façade of concrete blocks has an almost fortress-like appearance to ensure privacy from the street. The house is built with Way-Lite concrete blocks and Philippine mahogany trim. It has a second story, rare in a Usonian house, with cantilevered balconies. The living room has a built-in banquette facing a wooded scene through a wall of 10 foot high glass panes, symbolizing a transcendental pew set before the altar of nature. 
The public space is a dramatic focal point, with walls of glass and an open floor plan. Cut-out wooden panels of abstracted forms over 24 clerestory windows provide an unobtrusive yet restrained decorative touch to this lavish space. These recall Native American geometric motifs as well as stylized forms that may be based in nature. Construction was completed in 1956.
In 1988, Sharon and Lawrence Tarantino acquired the neglected Bachman Wilson House. Tarantino Architects has since guided the home's complete restoration and rebuilt the kitchen according to Wright's original drawings. Sharon and Lawrence Tarantino have received several awards for their restoration work, including the Wright Spirit Award.
The house is located along the Millstone River in Millstone Borough. It exemplifies Wright's "Usonian" philosophy and employs his early green building principles, including minimizing the size of the house and ancillary spaces, pioneering passive solar and radiant heat design, employing natural daylight and recycling construction waste. 
As its location is prone to flooding, the owners are seeking to relocate and rebuild it at a safer site in order to preserve it. 
On January 15, 2014 the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas announced that it was acquiring the Bachman-Wilson house and have made plans to relocate the house in its entirety to the museum's campus.

Pittsburgh, Johnstown, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad

The Pittsburgh, Johnstown, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad was a railroad corporation in Pennsylvania, intended to unite two local short lines in Clearfield, Blair and Cambria Counties and create a coal-hauling railroad to compete with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). Highly speculative, the railroad never had the financing necessary to begin construction. Chartered in 1897, it began to lose control of the two short lines in 1900, but continued to litigate the matter until 1909. Left a paper corporation without railroad property, it was dissolved a few years later.
Charter and origins.
The company was chartered on October 2, 1897, to build a railroad from a connection with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Johnstown and the Altoona and Philipsburg Connecting Railroad (A&PC) at Ramey. The line would climb north from Johnstown along Hinkston Run to Ebensburg, and turn east to cut across the drainages to Loretto. From there, it would follow the PRR's Cresson and Irvona Branch, connecting with the Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad (A&BC) at Dean before turning away to cross the Pennsylvania and Northwestern Railroad at Utahville and descending to Ramey. It obtained a lease of the A&PC on October 20, 1897.
The principal figure behind the line was Samuel P. Langdon, a mine owner in the Clearfield Coalfield. Rail shipments from the coalfield were almost entirely controlled by the PRR, and Langdon had already chartered and built the A&PC and engaged in a court battle for control of the A&BC. The PJE&E represented an extension of Langdon's original plan to connect the two railroads, giving Altoona and the southern Clearfield Coalfield an alternative outlet to the PRR, via the Beech Creek Railroad (New York Central) at Philipsburg. Langdon's earlier battle for control of the A&BC (then known as the Altoona, Clearfield & Northern) had ended in failure when a group of stockholders he had contracted with failed to deliver a controlling interest in the railroad. In the aftermath, he brought suit against the group, who subsequently gained control of the AC&N after it was foreclosed and reorganized as the A&BC. To settle the lawsuit, they leased the A&BC to the PJE&E on highly favorable terms.
Failure.
Langdon's plan was speculative in the extreme. Construction south of Loretto would be difficult and the grade steep; nor was the A&BC's steep, twisting line into Altoona particularly suitable for heavy coal traffic. Short on funds, no construction work was done on the PJE&E proper. It did order two narrow gauge engines for the A&BC in 1901. In the meantime, the lease of the A&BC was annulled by the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County in 1900, due to Langdon's failure to complete the PJE&E. The latter company appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and obtained an extension until January 1, 1902, to complete its railroad and retain the lease. It did not succeed in doing any new construction, and the Blair County sheriff ejected the PJE&E's officers from the A&BC at the end of 1901.
The PJE&E did continue to operate the A&PC from Phillipsburg to Ramey. On August 1, 1903, the PJE&E was sold to the New York and Pittsburg Central Railroad, an unincorporated railroad run by Langdon. However, suit was brought against the company by the A&PC bondholders, including W.L. Shellenberger, president of the A&BC and head of the stockholders whom Langdon had sued. They sought to have the A&PC placed in receivership, terminating the PJE&E operation. Legal skirmishing continued for the next several years, during which Langdon sold off two of the A&PC's new engines. The case was finally settled in 1906, when the court ordered the A&PC to be sold on April 1, 1906 should it default on the first mortgage payments, as it inevitably would.
Legal maneuvers.
On April 1, it was announced that the A&PC had been bought by the New York and Pittsburgh Air Line Railroad, which had been organized on March 22, 1906. One of the directors was John Langdon, a mine owner in Huntingdon County and probably a relative and agent of Samuel P. As the road was then in the hands of a court-appointed receiver, the NY&PAL's ability to carry out this transaction was highly suspect. It did briefly operate the A&PC, which in the meantime was sold to David L. Krebs, for the bondholders; the sheriff of Clearfield County turned the railroad over to him on September 27, and it was reorganized as the Philipsburg Railroad the next year. Litigation by the NY&PAL to regain control continued, unsuccessfully, until 1909. The PJE&E, which had managed to get a number of the A&PC's gondola cars returned to Langdon's Oak Ridge Coal Co. rather than to the A&PC, remained in existence as a paper railroad and was foreclosed on April 12, 1909. It was reorganized as the Philipsburg and Johnstown Railroad on September 14, 1909, and was listed as defunct by the Public Utilities Commission in 1911–1912.

Siege of Kahun

The Siege of Kahun was a siege of the isolated hilltop fort of Kahun during the First Anglo-Afghan War.
Course.
A 300-man detachment from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Bombay Native Infantry, led by Captain Brown, marched on Kahun, then the Marri tribe's main stronghold, in order to support the Bombay field force's march north into Sindh. The force took it with little opposition and occupied it. As ordered, Brown sent back the detachment's baggage camels with escort of 50 men (consisting of a half-squadron of Scinde Horse and 50 men of the Maratha Light Infantry) and an additional 80-man escort under Subedar Bay Jadhao to get it past hostile Marri troops in the area. Jadhao decided to return after 12 miles, having seen no enemy troops, but soon after this point both escorts were overwhelmed, with only 12 survivors (not including Jadhao). This reduced Brown's force to 140 men, and the enemy force immediately besieged Kahun. Holding off the besieging force from May to September, Brown eventually received word from the Officer Commanding in Upper Sind to do whatever he thought best for his men's safety and so surrendered on 12 September. The Marris accorded him the honours of war, letting the small remnants of Brown's force to march out in possession of their arms, guns, ammunition, and baggage. In recognition of their conduct, the General Orders of 5 April 1841 accorded the battle honour "Kahun" to the 5th Native Infantry and in May 1841 the unit was honoured by being made "Light Infantry".

2009 USA-Brazil Challenge

The first ever USA-Brazil curling Challenge was held from January 30 to February 1, 2009 at the Bismarck Capital Curling Club in Bismarck, North Dakota.
The challenge featured the Brazilian national men's curling team against an American team in a best-of-five series. The winner gets to represent the second team from the Americas at the 2009 Ford World Men's Curling Championship. Canada automatically qualifies as both hosts and defending champions.
Until 2009, the United States (and Canada) have always automatically qualified on account of no other country in the Americas fielding curling teams. However, in 2008 the Brazilian Ice Sports Federation felt that their men's curling team had a high enough calibre that they were ready to face off with the Americans.
The American team was represented by Todd Birr, whose team was highest on the U.S. Order of Merit as of December 31, 2008 and who qualified for the 2009 United States Olympic Curling Trials. 
The Brazilians were represented by their national team, which trained at the Lennoxville Curling Club in Lennoxville, Quebec. They are all students at the University of Sherbrooke.

Iskanwaya

Iskanwaya is a pre-Columbian sacred site, situated on a mountain ridge above the Río Llica in Bolivia, 325 km north of La Paz. In its extension and its age Iskanwaya surpasses Machu Picchu in Peru, but its less well preserved.
Location.
The sacred site of Iskanwaya is found on the edge of the Cordillera Real, 250 m above the Río Llica and 1,672 meters above sea level. The site is located near Aucapata, a small town in the Muñecas Province.
Site.
The city of Iskanwaya was built on two platforms on an area of 0.6 square kilometers and was notable for its running water. More than one hundred large buildings of an average of thirteen rooms have survived. Mollo streets ran in east-west direction. Their houses were rectangular and grouped around patios, they were built with blocks of slate stone, joined with mud trench mortars. Agriculture patterns included terracing and irrigation.
UN-archaeologist Alvaro R. Fernholz Jemio suggests that in its time the site was inhabited by 2,500 to 3.000 people
Mollo Culture.
The Iskanwaya ruins go back to the Mollo culture which predated the Inca civilization and whose people presumably built the constructions as early as 800 BC or in their prime cultural period from 1145 to 1425.

Club career.
Simpson joined the London Wasps England Rugby Academy full-time from St Benedict's School in the summer of 2006, but spent much of the subsequent two years at Blackheath Rugby Club on loan.
In the 2008/09 season Simpson graduated to the Wasps first team, coming on as a substitute a number of times and gaining a more frequent position in the starting XV towards the latter part of the season. He scored on his debut and was awarded fourth place in the Guinness Premiership Try of the Season award.
Simpson signed a full-time senior contract with London Wasps in the summer of 2009 securing his place at the club for two years. He was in the starting line-up for the opening game of the season on 5 September 2009 against Harlequins, played at Twickenham as part of the London Double Header . In the first minute Simpson was head-butted by George Robson, the Harlequins' lock, in an off-the-ball incident. After treatment on the field for a cut sustained to his nose Simpson continued to play for the remaining 79 minutes, despite feeling sick and dizzy.
On 17 December 2010, London Wasps announced that Simpson had signed a three-year extension to his contract which will keep him at the club until the end of the 2013/14 season.
International career.
In May 2006 Simpson earned his first cap in the England Under 19 team, playing against Wales.
In the 2007/08 season he secured a place with the England sevens' side, travelling to Dubai for the IRB World Seven Series tournament, and was also named in the England Under 20s squad.

On 12 January 2011, it was announced that Simpson had been called up to the senior England squad (EPS) for the 6 Nations tournament.
On 22 August 2011 Simpson was named in the 30-man England squad heading to New Zealand for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, the opportunity arising following an injury to Danny Care. On 18 September 2011, Simpson replaced Ben Youngs in the 66th minute against Georgia in the pool stages of the Rugby World Cup 2011 to win his long anticipated first cap. He was only the second player to win his first cap for England in a Rugby World cup tournament – second to Joe Worsley who was the first player to do so at the 1999 Rugby World Cup.

Pittsburgh and Susquehanna Railroad

The Pittsburgh and Susquehanna Railroad owned a railroad between Philipsburg and Fernwood, Pennsylvania, with a branch to Beaver Run. The main line had been built by the Altoona and Philipsburg Connecting Railroad (nicknamed the "Alley Popper"), incorporated in July 1892. Through successive foreclosures and reorganizations, the property passed to the New York and Pittsburgh Air Line Railroad in April 1906, the Philipsburg Railroad in January 1907, the Philipsburg and Susquehanna Valley Railroad in December 1909, and the Pittsburgh and Susquehanna Railroad in March 1910. Finally, in August 1913, that company was reorganized once more, under the same name.
The railroad staged a train wreck in 1914 for the film "The Valley of Lost Hope", a western directed by Romaine Fielding. The line was abandoned in 1936; it had been placed in receivership in April 1931 and ceased operations on August 8, 1931 due to poor track condition. The receiver was unable to raise money for repairs, despite authorization from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to issue $20,000 of receiver's certificates, and the ICC approved abandonment in October 1936.

Moshe Cotel

Moshe Cotel (February 20, 1943 – October 24, 2008) was a pianist and composer whose music was strongly influenced by his Jewish roots. Cotel moved from his Jewish roots to focus on music for most of his life, and received his rabbinic ordination and synagogue pulpit in the years before his death.
Morris Cotel was born February 20, 1943 in Baltimore, and was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family. As a youth, Cotel was simultaneously enrolled in the Talmudic Academy of Baltimore and the Peabody Conservatory of the Johns Hopkins University where he studied music and took college-preparatory classes, having enrolled at the age of 9. He wrote a 200-page symphony as a 13-year-old, to the astonishment of his piano teacher at Peabody who did not believe him until he pulled the completed score out of his bag.
He earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the Juilliard School in New York City, in 1964 and 1965 respectively. Cotel won the American Academy in Rome Prize for music composition at age 23, and studied art in Italy for two years. Cotel had been a professor of music composition at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore from 1972, until he retired in 2000. After moving to New York City in 1977, he retained his position at Peabody, commuting to Baltimore on a weekly basis.
A review in "The New York Times" of a 1977 performance at what is now the Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, opened with the statement "That Morris Cotel is a composer-pianist of unusual capabilities seems beyond question."
His opera "Deronda" was based on the title character in George Eliot's novel "Daniel Deronda", a Victorian era English Jew who combines proto-Zionism with Kabbalistic ideas. "The Fire and the Mountains" is a cantata he wrote that memorializes the Holocaust. The choral piece "Trope for Orchestra" integrated cantillation used in public readings of the Torah in synagogue. His 1985 two-act opera "Dreyfus" was based on the trial and conviction of the unjustly accused French officer Alfred Dreyfus and the anti-Semitism it aroused in France.
In anticipation of a trip to Germany and Austria for performances of his opera "Dreyfus", Cotel engaged the assistance of a Holocaust survivor from Washington Heights, Manhattan to help improve his German language skills. Cotel later met the same woman, who told him that hearing his efforts to spread the story of Alfred Dreyfus had convinced her to return to Judaism. This encounter convinced Cotel to become a rabbi. As Cotel described the encounter, "Without knowing it, I had changed this woman’s life, and she had no idea that she had just changed mine". He enrolled part-time at the Academy for Jewish Religion in Riverdale shortly after his encounter in Washington Heights. He retired from the Peabody Conservatory from his position as chairman of the composition department in 2003 to devote his full-time efforts to his rabbinical studies and received his rabbinic ordination three years later. "My religion changed from Judaism to classical music, and in adulthood it changed back again" were the words Cotel used to describe his transformations.
While playing piano in 1996, his 3-year-old cat, Ketzel, jumped on the keyboard. Cotel transcribed the descending paw pattern and entered the score in the Paris New Music Review's One-Minute Competition for pieces under 60 seconds, with Cotel (and Ketzel) winning honorable mention.
Rabbi Cotel spent his last five years before his death as spiritual leader of Temple Beth El of Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn. Cotel died of natural causes on October 24, 2008 at age 65 in his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan home. His wife found him on the floor wearing his tallit and tefillin for the morning prayer service, and had assumed he was meditating, knowing that he preferred to pray alone each morning for two hours, before realizing that he had died peacefully.

MWM GmbH

The MWM GmbH (formerly known as DEUTZ Power Systems or DPS) is a mechanical engineering company, based in Mannheim. For many years it was known as Motoren-Werke Mannheim (MWM). In 2009 the company was the third-largest producer (by revenue) of gas and diesel engines.
The main focus of production is gensets (gas and diesel engines) for the generation of electrical energy from 400 to 4,300 kWel per unit. It also provides consulting, designing and engineering, construction and commissioning of plants as well as global aftersales service. The company also has its own training center.
History.
In 1922 the department for the construction of stationary engines was outsourced and had its name changed from "Benz & Cie. Rheinische Gasmotorenfabrik in Mannheim" to "Motorenwerke Mannheim". The renowned German engineer Prosper L'Orange, a pioneer of diesel engine technology, was the technical manager then. Before that he worked for Benz & Cie. The construction of diesel engines in particular used to be the core business of MWM, amongst others for utility vehicles and agricultural machines.
In 1924 MWM manufactured their first tractor, which was called "Motorpferd" ("motor horse"). In 1931, tractor production was discontinued. For quite a long time, combines by Claas, tractors by the French manufacturer Renault, and by the German companies Fendt, Lanz, Bautz, Holder and Ritscher, were equipped with MWM engines.
In 1926 Knorr-Bremse AG was able to acquire the majority of shares and took over. In 1985 they sold MWM to Deutz AG (Cologne). The company's site was maintained. The company, along with MAN SE, remained the chief engine manufacturer in the field of commercial diesel engines in Germany. DEUTZ restructured the whole company several times and expanded the gas engine division.
In August 2007, DEUTZ sold the engine company to the financial investor 3i as Deutz Power Systems for 360 million euros.
On 1 October 2008 Deutz Power Systems was renamed MWM GmbH.
Today MWM offers mainly gas engines for cogeneration units and biogas plants with an output between 400 and 4,300 kilowatts. To a smaller extent also diesel engines are still produced.
On 22 October 2010 Caterpillar Inc. officially announced an agreement with 3i regarding the acquisition of MWM for 580 million euros. Subject to the consent of prudential authorities MWM will then become part of Caterpillar`s Electric Power Division.
On 8 October MWM announced that it will change its name to Caterpillar Energy Solutions as of 1 of November 2013.

Golf de Granville Baie du Mont St Michel

The Golf de Granville Baie du Mont St Michel is a 27 hole golf course located at Bréville-sur-Mer (Manche), approximately 4 miles north of Granville, Normandy, France.
The course was first laid out in 1912 and then totally redisgned by Harry Colt in 1921. This is the only true links course in France. In addition to the main 18 hole course, there is a nine hole par 33 links course established in 1986 which is notable for its testing greens!
History.
In 1910, a local hotel company began negotiations to rent land in the Bréville dunes from the Granville town council. The first 9 holes were begun by a group of local enthusiasts in 1912 with a view to a further 9 holes to be added later. The Cercle des Sports took charge of the new course which was not officially inaugurated until July 5, 1914 although it had been in play for two years by then. The First World War soon put a stop to play and a part of the course was requisitioned by the local garrison. After the war Granville grew in popularity as a resort and so the course needed to be upgraded. Thus in 1921 plans were laid and work was begun under the supervision of Harry Colt, the famed English golf architect. Colt made good use of the magnificent dune landscape to design one of the largest courses in Europe at that time. A visit in 1922 by the renowned specialist in golf course design, Martin Sutton, confirmed the natural quality of the linksland. He was so impressed by what he saw on his visit across the channel that he wrote: 'the site is a golfing paradise... I doubt if there's a course even in England or Scotland that has a more favourable natural situation.' The Granville links is a magnificent example of Harry Colt's work as a golf course designer. During World War Two the club house was requisitioned and the course closed by the occupying army. In 1957, a small group of golfers restored the course to its original layout. The course is much changed since then with only a dozen of the original holes remaining. However, the newer holes do largely follow the original layout. Despite these changes, the course still challenges players of all standards and especially in the wind - just as on the links of Scotland or Ireland.
The designer, Christian Dior, was born in Granville and played golf at the Golf de Granville. When he came back from doing his military service in 1928, he organised a small competition for a few of his friends. This idea was taken up by the club in 1973 and since then a competition has been held in his honour each year - La Coupe Dior, of which a photo can be seen below in the gallery.
In 2008, the course was once again the venue for a national championship, the Mid Amateur (+35 years of age). 
The first photo in the gallery shows the 17th green during this championship which was held at Granville in September 2008.

Des Cahill

Desmond "Des" Cahill is an Irish sports presenter and commentator with national broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann. He presents a daily radio programme called "Drivetime Sport" on RTÉ Radio 1, while on television he has presented "The Sunday Game", "The Road to Croker", "Play It Again, Des", and "Up for the Match".
In 2011, he was blacklisted by the Football Association of Ireland.
Early life.
Cahill was educated at Colaiste Mhuire, in Dublin, and he began his career as a newspaper reporter. While studying journalism in Rathmines, he spent a couple of years working with "The Irish Press" group, before moving on to two of Ireland's leading provincial newspapers - the "Carlow Nationalist" and "The Kerryman".
Career.
1980s.
Cahill joined RTÉ in 1984 as a TV news reporter, but quickly began reporting for the "Sunday Sport" programme on RTÉ Radio 1. By 1987 he had taken over as presenter of the flagship programme from Jimmy Magee.
He has presented programmes from many of the world's top sporting events, including some memorable Irish victories at Olympic Games, FIFA World Cups, UEFA European Championships, Tour de France and the Ryder Cup.
For 20 years he was associated with early morning radio - presenting the sports news on the main news programme, "Morning Ireland" on RTÉ Radio 1, and in a very different style, with Ian Dempsey on 2FM. It was on Dempsey's show that he began the "ABU (Anyone But United) Club" and each year he supported the main rivals of football team Manchester United in the English Premier League. He designed an "ABU" shirt, with a crest in Latin, reading ""Uppus Cantonis Aris"". He engaged with listeners, whose letters and e-mails became a key part of the show.
1990s.
In the mid-1990s, Cahill began a sports phone-in programme on RTÉ Radio 1, "Sportscall". At one stage it ran three nights a week, but it was on Monday nights, after the weekend games, that fans from all over the country let off steam. He also helped Gay Byrne out with "The Gay Byrne Show" before Byrne retired in 1998.
On television, he presented "Sideline View", RTÉ's first midweek Gaelic Games Championship programme, in the mid-1990s. Apart from special reports from the counties, the programme used the existing panellists from "The Sunday Game", and added the likes of Pete Finnerty and Tommy Lyons who themselves went on to become panellists on "The Sunday Game".
This was followed by "Play It Again, Des" where Cahill invited some of Ireland's top sporting names to choose their favourite sporting moments from the archives. Guests included Mick O'Dwyer, Johnny Giles, Eamonn Dunphy, Ken Doherty, Moss Keane, Christy O'Connor Jnr, Fergus Slattery, Jimmy Barry-Murphy, Ted Walsh, Liam Brady, Kevin Moran, Mick Doyle, Ger Loughnane, Ollie Campbell and Brian Kerr.
In 1993, Cahill received a Jacob's Award for his radio broadcasts.
2000s.
In May 2004, while discussing Westmeath's first victory over Offaly in 55 years with Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh on "Morning Ireland", Cahill attracted criticism for his remarks that Westmeath had been under BIFFOs for all that time.
Before the launch of "The Road to Croker" a weekly Gaelic Games programme, that included a live audience as it visited clubs around the country ahead of the big Championship. When Cahill went to Beijing for the Summer Olympics in 2008, Bertie Ahern took over presenting duties on "The Road to Croker". Cahill also presents "Up for the Match", the RTÉ entertainment programme that celebrates the All-Ireland final, on the eve of both the Hurling and Gaelic Football finals. Initially he co-presented with Mary Kennedy, but in 2008, Gráinne Seoige became his co-presenter.
He has appeared on "The Restaurant", where he scored five stars from the critics.
In 2009, he became the presenter of the evening highlights edition of "The Sunday Game". Also that year he celebrated 25 years in broadcasting, and was reunited with Ian Dempsey when he appeared on "The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show" on Today FM.
2010s.
On 9 June 2010, Cahill co-hosted the opening ceremony of the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games Irish heats at Thomond Park with Ian Dempsey.
In July 2011, the Football Association of Ireland complained about remarks made by Cahill while discussing the organisation's AGM on the "Saturday Sport" radio show. RTÉ bosses "rejected outright" the complaint, and the FAI threatened to sue. Dion Fanning in the "Sunday Independent" said, "Refusing to talk to Des Cahill is a bit like forbidding your children to read "Gentle Ben" because playing with bears is dangerous."
Cahill is featured on "Nob Nation".
Awards.
During his career, Cahill has won a Jacob's Award in 1993, an ESB Journalist of the Year award for sport, and was named PPI Sports Presenter of the Year in 2007.
Personal life.
He is married to Caroline, a native of Ballyshannon.

Backstreet Girls

Backstreet Girls are a Norwegian rock band. Formed in 1984, they have released 14 records.
History.
The band was formed in 1984 by brothers Pål Kristensen on bass and Tom Kristensen on vocals. They were joined by guitarist Petter Baarli, formerly of the band Riff/Raff, and his brother, drummer Bjørn Terje Baarli.
In 1985 Tom Kristensen left the band, to be replaced by Arne Aarnes. Later that year they started writing and recording their first album, and also contributed to the Norwegian film "X".
In 1986 they released their debut album "Mental Shakedown" on the small independent label Medicine Records. The album was released on a very limited press at first, but was re-released three years later on Polygram Records. Later that year Arne Aarnes left the band, and was replaced by Bjørn Müller of the band Z-off.
The line-up of Petter Baarli, Pål Kristensen, Bjørn Terje Baarli and Bjørn Müller remained for the subsequent three albums, "Boogie Till' You Puke", "Party On Elmstreet" and "Coming Down Hard".
In May 1991 Bjørn Müller left the band, and was replaced by the band's fourth vocalist, Ole Hillborg, formerly of Glorius Bankrobbers. The album "Let's Have It" was released in October 1992 on Warner Music.
In 1993 the band released a live album "Live - Get Yer Yo-Yo's Out", and Ole Hillborg left the band shortly thereafter.
After this The Backstreet Girls went to England to hold auditions for another lead singer. They chose Irishman Pat Diamond, and returned to Norway to perform some concerts and record an album. The album "Don't Fake It Too Long" was not released until 2008 . However, Diamond was soon deported from Norway, and by 1995 Bjørn Müller had rejoined the band as lead vocalist.
In 1997 the 7" single "Monster In My Caddillac" was released on Hit!Me Records, but another album was not to appear until 1999, six years after the previous one, when the album "Hellway To High" was released on FaceFront Records.
In October 1999 bassist Pål Kristensen left the band to be replaced by Morten Lunde, of The Mormones.
In November 2000 Universal Records released a greatest hits compilation entitled "Boogie Till' You Bleed".
In March 2001 the band released their eight studio album, "Tuff Tuff Tuff", on FaceFront Records, and that summer went on a tour of Europe with Australian band Rose Tattoo, a long-time influence on the Backstreet Girls. Live recordings of these concerts were released in September 2002 on the album "Black Boogie Death Rock N' Roll" featuring six live recordings from the tour and six new songs.
At the end of 2002 Morten Lunde left the band to concentrate on his other band, The Mormones, and Dan Thunderbird was recruited on bass.
In 2003 the band recorded another album in between touring. The album was released in June on Facefront Records, entitled "Sick My Duck". The band embarked on a Norwegian tour of over 20 dates called "Boogie My Life Away Tour".

Shockley–Queisser limit

In physics, the Shockley–Queisser limit or detailed balance limit refers to the maximum theoretical efficiency of a solar cell using a p-n junction to collect power from the cell. It was first calculated by William Shockley and Hans Queisser at Shockley Semiconductor in 1961. The limit is one of the most fundamental to solar energy production, and is considered to be one of the most important contributions in the field.
The limit places maximum solar conversion efficiency around 33.7% assuming a single p-n junction with a band gap of 1.34 eV (using an AM 1.5 solar spectrum). That is, of all the power contained in sunlight falling on an ideal solar cell (about 1000 W/m²), only 33.7% of that could ever be turned into electricity (337 W/m²). The most popular solar cell material, silicon, has a less favourable band gap of 1.1 eV, resulting in a maximum efficiency of 29%. Modern commercial mono-crystalline solar cells produce about 22% conversion efficiency, the losses due largely to practical concerns like reflection off the front surface and light blockage from the thin wires on its surface.
The Shockley–Queisser limit only applies to cells with a single p-n junction; cells with multiple layers can outperform this limit. In the extreme, with an infinite number of layers, the corresponding limit is 86% using concentrated sunlight.
Background.
In a traditional solid-state semiconductor, a solar cell is made from two doped crystals, one an n-type semiconductor, which has extra free electrons, and the other a p-type semiconductor, which is lacking free electrons. When placed in contact, some of the electrons in the n-type portion will flow into the p-type to "fill in" the missing electrons, also known as "holes." Eventually enough will flow across the boundary to equalize the Fermi levels of the two materials. The result is a region at the interface, the p-n junction, where charge carriers are depleted and/or accumulated on each side of the interface. In silicon, this transfer of electrons produces a potential barrier of about 0.6 V to 0.7 V.
When placed in the sun, photons in the sunlight can strike the bound electrons in the p-type side of the semiconductor, giving them more energy, a process known technically as photoexcitation. In silicon, sunlight can provide enough energy to push an electron out of the lower-energy valence band into the higher-energy conduction band. As the name implies, electrons in the conduction band are free to move about the silicon. When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons will flow out of the p-type side into the n-type side, lose energy while moving through the external circuit, and then back into the p-type material where they can once again re-combine with the valence-band hole they left behind, producing a lower-energy photon or heat. In this way, sunlight creates an electrical current.
The Limit.
The Shockley–Queisser limit is calculated by examining the amount of electrical energy that is extracted per photon of incoming sunlight. There are three primary considerations:
Blackbody radiation.
Any material, that is not at absolute zero (0 Kelvin), emits electromagnetic radiation through blackbody radiation. In the case of a solar cell at ambient room temperature, at 300 Kelvin, a baseline energy is always being emitted. This energy cannot be captured by the cell, and represents about 7% of the available incoming energy.
This radiation effect is dependent on cell temperature. Any energy lost in a cell is generally turned into heat, so any inefficiency in the cell increases the cell temperature when it is placed in sunlight. As the temperature of the cells increases, the blackbody radiation also increases, until an equilibrium is reached. In practice this equilibrium is normally reached at temperatures as high as 360 Kelvin, and cells normally operate at lower efficiencies than their room temperature rating. Module datasheets normally list this temperature dependency as TNOCT.
Radiative recombination.
Absorption of a photon creates an electron-hole pair, which could potentially contribute to the current. However, the reverse process must also be possible, according to the principle of detailed balance: an electron and a hole can meet and recombine, emitting a photon. This process reduces the efficiency of the cell. Other recombination processes may also exist (see "Other considerations" below), but this one is absolutely required.
Spectrum losses.
Since the act of moving an electron from the valence band to the conduction band requires energy, only photons with more than that amount of energy will produce a photoelectron. In silicon the conduction band is about 1.1 eV away from the valence band, which corresponds to red light. In other words, photons of red, yellow and blue light will all contribute to power production, whereas infrared, microwaves and radio waves will not. This places an immediate limit on the amount of energy that can be extracted from the sun. Of the 1,000 W/m² in AM1.5 sunlight, about 19% of that has less than 1.1 eV of energy, and will not produce power in a silicon cell. Another important contributor to losses is that any energy above and beyond the bandgap energy is lost; while blue light has roughly twice the energy of red light, that energy is not captured by devices with a single p-n junction. The electron is ejected with higher energy when struck by a blue photon, but it loses this extra energy as it travels toward the p-n junction (the energy is converted into heat). This accounts for about 33% of the incident sunlight, meaning that from spectrum losses alone there is a theoretical conversion efficiency of about 48%, ignoring all other factors.
All together.
Considering the spectrum losses alone, a solar cell has a peak theoretical efficiency of 48%. Thus the spectrum losses represent the vast majority of lost power. Including the effects of blackbody radiation and recombination, a single-junction cell made will have a theoretical peak performance of about 33.7%, or about 337 W/m² in AM1.5.
Other considerations.
Shockley and Queisser's work considered the most basic physics only, there are a number of other factors that further reduce the theoretical power.
Limited mobility.
When an electron is ejected through photoexcitation, the atom it was formerly bound to is left with a net positive charge. Under normal conditions, the atom will pull off an electron from a surrounding atom in order to neutralize itself. That atom will then attempt to remove an electron from another atom, and so forth, producing an ionization chain reaction that moves through the cell. Since these can be viewed as the motion of a positive charge, it is useful to refer to them as "holes", a sort of virtual positive electron.
Like electrons, holes move around the material, and will be attracted towards a source of electrons. Normally these are provided through an electrode on the back surface of the cell. Meanwhile the photoelectrons are moving forward towards the electrodes on the front surface. For a variety of reasons, holes in silicon move much more slowly than electrons. This means that during the finite time while the electron is moving forward towards the p-n junction, it may meet a slowly moving hole left behind by a previous photoexcitation. When this occurs, the electron recombines at that atom, and the energy is lost (normally through the emission of a photon of that energy, but there are a variety of possible processes).
Recombination places an upper limit on the "rate" of production; past a certain rate there are so many holes in motion that new electrons will never make it to the p-n junction. In silicon this reduces the theoretical performance under normal operating conditions by another 10% over and above the thermal losses noted above. Materials with higher electron (or hole) mobility can improve on silicon's performance; gallium arsenide (GaAs) cells gain about 5% in real-world examples due to this effect alone. In brighter light, when it is concentrated by mirrors or lenses for example, this effect is magnified. Normal silicon cells quickly saturate, while GaAs continue to improve at concentrations as high as 1500 times.
Non-radiative recombination.
Recombination between electrons and holes is detrimental in a solar cell, so designers try to minimize it. However, radiative recombination—when an electron and hole recombine to create a photon that exits the cell into the air—is inevitable, because it is the time-reversed process of light absorption. Therefore the Shockley-Queisser calculation takes radiative recombination into account; but it assumes (optimistically) that there is no other source of recombination. More realistic limits, which are lower than the Shockley–Queisser limit, can be calculated by taking into account other causes of recombination. These include recombination at defects and grain boundaries.
In crystalline silicon, even if there are no crystalline defects, there is still Auger recombination, which occurs much more often than radiative recombination. By taking this into account, the theoretical efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells was calculated to be 29.4%.
Exceeding the Limit.
It is important to note that the limit makes several fundamental assumptions; that the cell contains a single p-n junction, that the junction is tuned to visible light, and that any extra energy in the photons is lost. None of these assumptions is necessarily true, and a number of different approaches have been used to significantly surpass the basic limit.
The analysis of Shockley and Queisser was based on the following assumptions:
Tandem cells.
The most widely explored path to higher efficiency solar cells has been multijunction photovoltaic cells (also called "tandem cells"). These cells use multiple p-n junctions, each one tuned to a particular frequency of the spectrum. This reduces the problem discussed above, that a material with a single given bandgap cannot absorb sunlight below the bandgap, and cannot take full advantage of sunlight far above the bandgap. In the most common design, a high-bandgap solar cell sits on top, absorbing high-energy, low-wavelength light, and transmitting the rest. Beneath it is a lower-bandgap solar cell which absorbs some of the lower-energy, longer-wavelength light. There may be yet another cell beneath that one, with as many as four layers in total.
The calculation of the fundamental efficiency limits of these "tandem cells" (or "multi-junction cells") works in a fashion similar to those for single-junction cells, with the caveat that some of the light will be converted to other frequencies and re-emitted within the structure. Using methods similar to the original Shockley-Queisser analysis with these considerations in mind produces similar results; a two-layer cell can reach 42% efficiency, three-layer cells 49%, and a theoretical infinity-layer cell 68% in un-concentrated sunlight.
The majority of tandem cells that have been produced to date use three layers, tuned to blue (on top), yellow (middle) and red (bottom). These cells require the use of semiconductors that can be tuned to specific frequencies, which has led to most of them being made of gallium arsenide (GaAs) compounds, often germanium for red, GaAs for yellow, and GaInP2 for blue. They are very expensive to produce, using techniques similar to microprocessor construction but with "chip" sizes on the scale of several centimeters. In cases where outright performance is the only consideration, these cells have become common; they are widely used in satellite applications for instance, where the power-to-weight ratio overwhelms practically every other consideration. They also can be used in concentrated photovoltaic applications (see below), where a relatively small solar cell can serve a large area.
Tandem cells are not restricted to high-performance applications; they are also used to make moderate-efficiency photovoltaics out of cheap but low-efficiency materials. One example is amorphous silicon solar cells, where triple-junction tandem cells are commercially available from Uni-Solar and other companies.
Light concentration.
Sunlight can be concentrated with lenses or mirrors to much higher intensity. The sunlight intensity is a parameter in the Shockley-Queisser calculation, and with more concentration, the theoretical efficiency limit increases somewhat. (If, however, the intense light heats up the cell, which often occurs in practice, the theoretical efficiency limit may go down all things considered.) In practice, the choice of whether or not to use light concentration is based primarily on other factors besides the small change in solar cell efficiency. These factors include the relative cost per area of solar cells versus focusing optics like lenses or mirrors, the cost of sunlight-tracking systems, the proportion of light successfully focused onto the solar cell, and so on.
A wide variety of optical systems can be used to concentrate sunlight, including ordinary lenses and curved mirrors, fresnel lenses, arrays of small flat mirrors, and luminescent solar concentrators. Another proposal suggests spreading out an array of microscopic solar cells on a surface, and focusing light onto them via microlens arrays, while yet another proposal suggests designing a semiconductor nanowire array in such a way that light is concentrated in the nanowires.
Impurity photovoltaics.
There has been some work on the use of deliberate impurities to produce mid-energy states within single crystal structures. These cells would combine some of the advantages of the multi-junction cell with the simplicity of existing silicon designs. A detailed limit calculation for these cells with a wide variety of impurities suggests a maximum efficiency of 77.2% To date, no commercial cell using this technique has been produced.
Photon upconversion.
As discussed above, photons with energy below the bandgap are wasted in ordinary single-junction solar cells. One way to reduce this waste is to use photon upconversion, i.e. incorporating into the module a molecule or material that can absorb two or more below-bandgap photons and then emit one above-bandgap photon. Another possibility is to use two-photon absorption, but this can only work at extremely high light concentration.
Hot electron capture.
Since much of the Shockley–Queisser limit is due to energy losses between the photon energy and the energy captured from the electrons they produce, it should be no surprise that there has been a considerable amount of research into ways to capture the energy of the electrons before they can lose it in the crystal structure. One system under investigation for this is quantum dots.
Multiple exciton generation.
A related concept is to use semiconductors that generate more than one excited electron per absorbed photon, instead of a single electron at the band edge. Quantum dots have been extensively investigated for this effect, and they have been shown to work for solar-relevant wavelengths in prototype solar cells.
Another, more straight-forward way to utilise multiple exciton generation is a process called singlet fission (or singlet exciton fission) by which a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet excitons of lower energy. This allows for higher theoretical efficiencies when coupled to a low bandgap semiconductor and quantum efficiencies exceeding 100% have been reported.
Fluorescent downconversion/downshifting.
Another possibility for increased efficiency is to convert the frequency of light down towards the bandgap energy with a fluorescent material. In particular, to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit, it is necessary for the fluorescent material to convert a single high-energy photon into several lower-energy ones (quantum efficiency > 1). For example, one photon with more than double the bandgap energy can become two photons above the bandgap energy. In practice, however, this conversion process tends to be relatively inefficient. If a very efficient system were found, such a material could be painted on the front surface of an otherwise standard cell, boosting its efficiency for little cost. In contrast, considerable progress has been made in the exploration of fluorescent downshifting, which converts high-energy light (e. g., UV light) to low-energy light (e. g., red light) with a quantum efficiency smaller than 1. Dyes, rare-earth phosphors and quantum dots are actively investigated for fluorescent downshifting. For example, silicon quantum dots enabled downshifting has led to the efficiency enhancement of the state-of-the-art silicon solar cells.
Thermophotovoltaic downconversion.
Thermophotovoltaic cells are similar to phosphorescent systems, but use a plate to act as the downconvertor. Solar energy falling on the plate, typically black-painted metal, is re-emitted as lower-energy IR, which can then be captured in an IR cell. This relies on a practical IR cell being available, but the theoretical conversion efficiency can be calculated. For a converter with a bandgap of 0.92 eV, efficiency is limited to 54% with a single-junction cell, and 85% for concentrated light shining on ideal components with no optical losses and only radiative recombination.

Eluanbi Lighthouse

History.
Qing dynasty.
Eluanbi Lighthouse was built during the Qing Dynasty in 1888. Accidents in the area were quite often due to hidden reefs. In 1888, an English architect W. F. Spindey, a member of Royal Geographical Society, was hired to construct this lighthouse as a guide for nearby ships. The lighthouse is the only armed lighthouse in the world, with a trench surrounding it and many gun holes on the wall. The extra fortifications were required at the time it was built because of frequent raids by local aboriginal tribes.
Japanese rule period.
As a concession by the Qing Empire when it lost the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan became a colony of Japan. Severe damage suffered during the First Sino-Japanese War was repaired in 1898 during the Japanese rule period. However, during World War II, the lighthouse was again seriously damaged by Allied bombing during the Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa.
Present.
In 1962, the lighthouse was re-built as a conical concrete building with a white cover. Today, the lighthouse is still functional and is also held as a historical monument admired by many tourists in the Kenting National Park. In addition, next to the lighthouse there is an Eluanbi Memorial (see Gallery) of Taiwan Eight Magnificent Sceneries. On the memorial the Chinese "Eluanbi" () is sculptured on the surface, written in Wang Xizhi's calligraphy style.

UK Financial Investments

UK Financial Investments (UKFI) is a limited company set up in November 2008 and mandated by the UK Government to manage HM Treasury's shareholdings in banks subscribing to its recapitalisation fund. These currently include substantial holdings in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland Group; and previously also Northern Rock until that company was taken over by Virgin Money on 1 January 2012.
On 3 November 2009, the government injected further capital into RBS in particular, which resulted in the Treasury holding in that company rising from 70% to 83%. The Treasury holding in Lloyds dropped from 43% to 41% in February 2010 after it issued 3.14 billion new shares. The Treasury holding in Lloyds dropped again in 2013 from 39% to 33% after it sold £3.2 billion worth of shares.
UKFI also manages HM Treasury's investment in UK Asset Resolution which holds both Northern Rock (Asset Management) and Bradford & Bingley.
Investment aims.
The government said the aim of the company would be to “protect and create value for the taxpayer as shareholder, with due regard to financial stability and acting in a way that promotes competition” while also ensuring that the banks they own provide "competitively priced" loans to small businesses and homeowners "at 2007 levels".
Holdings.
UKFI have holdings in the following companies:
Board.
It was envisaged that membership of the UKFI Board would comprise a private sector chairman, three non-executive private sector members, a Chief Executive and two senior Government officials from HM Treasury and the Shareholder Executive. Sir Philip Hampton became the UKFI’s first Chair and John Kingman become the first chief executive; both took up these positions in 2008.
Glen Moreno (Chairman of Pearson PLC), Peter Gibbs (Chairman of Turquoise), Lucinda Riches (ex UBS) and Michael Kirkwood (ex Citigroup) were appointed as non-executive directors in January 2009.
Also in January 2009 it was announced that Sir Philip would become Chairman Designate of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and step down as Chairman of UKFI. He was replaced as Chairman by Sir David Cooksey in August 2009. On 28 October 2009 it was announced that Robin Budenberg would take over as chief executive of UKFI; Budenberg later became Chairman.
The Board comprises:
Controversy.
Robert Peston of the BBC said on 24 December 2008 "It's probably no exaggeration to say that—for the coming year or two at least—UKFI will be as important to all of us as the Treasury, or the Bank of England or the City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority".
It has been revealed that Glen Moreno was a former trustee of LGT Bank, a secretive company based in Liechtenstein, and embroiled in allegations of tax evasion. He has stated that he is not interested in a permanent position at UKFI.
In December 2012 an administrative error was uncovered in the wording of the loan agreements made by Northern Rock in 2008 for around 152,000 customers; the error may cost an estimated £270 million. As a result of the error the affected customers, who were borrowing £25,000 or less, may be entitled to a repayment of interest.

James Henry Blake

James Henry Blake (October 7, 1808 – August 1, 1874) was the City Marshal of Boston from 1840–1845, Blake was the son of Edward Blake and Sarah (Parkman) Blake and nephew of Dr. George Parkman. The Parkmans and Blakes were two prominent families of the Boston Brahmins who were well respected merchants. James established himself as a merchant and real estate broker and also served in the Massachusetts Artillery as Major of Independents Cadets beginning in 1830. In 1831, while conducting business aboard the ship "Mentos", two pirates boarded the boat where Blake witnessed their arrest. He testified against the pirates in the first of his many court appearances.
On May 12, 1835, he married Marianne Wildes of Boston and ran his brokerage on State Street. He was appointed City Marshal of Boston, May 1, 1840 at an annual salary of $1,000.00. Blake's term as Marshal was a quiet one and most of his activities involved overseeing July 4 celebrations on the Common, taking a census of buildings, banning illegal hay scales along the wharf, and clearing the streets of snow. He also passed a leash law forbidding large dogs to roam the streets. The most violence he saw was snowball fights, against which he swiftly levied hefty fines. For his due diligence, he received a salary increase of $100 in 1844.
Blake was replaced as Marshal by Ira Gibbons in 1845, and he returned to the more lucrative business of real estate. He opened an office on State Street and later, as his business grew, moved to Congress Street. In 1847, Blake, along with police officer Samuel D. Fuller, helped recover articles stolen from Ebenezer Mann, another merchant. Blake and Officer Fuller would meet again under more serious circumstances.
In May 1849, the City of Boston was growing weary of their City Marshal, Francis Tukey, and 17 citizens petitioned to have Blake return to fill the post, but Tukey held on. Later that year, Tukey was in the unenviable position of coordinating the investigation into the disappearance of Blake's uncle, Dr. George Parkman
The Disappearance of Dr. George Parkman.
On November 23, 1849, Blake's uncle, Dr. George Parkman, never returned home for lunch. The Parkman family asked the doctor's business manager, Charles M. Kinglsey, to search for him, and James and his brother Edward joined the effort. While Edward went to City Marshal Tukey to appeal for police help, James combed the streets of Boston. Tukey sent police officers to drag the river and search the areas the doctor frequented. On November 25, James was standing outside the Harvard Medical College, speaking to police officer Trenholm, when he was approached by one of the professors from the College, John White Webster.John Webster hurriedly approached him, hand outstretched. He was not wearing a coat, even though the weather required it, and it seemed as if he had just come from the College. James was confused as he only had a passing acquaintance with the Professor and yet here was Webster holding his hand while explaining he had a meeting with his uncle on day he went missing. He never suspected that he was conversing with the man that would later be hanged for Parkman's murder.
After this strange encounter, while still searching, James met William V. Thompson, the City Clerk. Thompson told James that he had seen his uncle the afternoon of November 23, just after 2:00 p.m. He also told him he had spoken to Dr. Webster about George Parkman and Webster told him that Parkman was angry and excited regarding Webster's failure to pay on the outstanding debt to him. On November 30, 1849, Parkman's remains were found by the College janitor in Dr. Webster's privy. James requested his own Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles T. Jackson, be present to examine the remains. There was little doubt they had found his uncle.
James recounted his meeting with Webster in the court trial. At the end of the twelve day trial, Webster was found guilty. Amid the furor of the verdict, Blake returned to his business.
Blake was involved in other court cases, either as a juror or a plaintiff. Two of his appearances as plaintiff involved the burglary of his clothes. James Henry Blake died on August 1, 1874 in a boating accident in the Boston Harbor.

Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988

The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (No. 49 of 1988) is a federal law enacted by the Parliament of India to combat corruption in government agencies and public sector businesses in India.
Provisions.
The act consists of 3 chapters spread across 31 sections.
Chapter I: Preliminary.
This chapter contains sections describing title, territorial extend, basic definitions, etc. Following are some sections:
Section 3: Appointment of special Judges.
Power To Appoint Special Judges:
The Central and the State Government is empowered to appoint Special Judges by placing a Notification in the Official Gazette, to try the following offences: 
· Any offence punishable under this Act.
· Any conspiracy to commit or any attempt to commit or any abetment of any of the offences specified under the Act.
The qualification for the Special Judge is that he should be or should have been a Session Judge or an Additional Session Judge or Assistant Session Judge under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
Section 4: Cases triable by special Judges.
The offences punishable under this act can be tried by special Judges only. When trying any case, the special Judge is empowered to try any offence other than an offence punishable under this act, with which the accused may be charged at the same trial. It is recommended that the special Judge should hold the trial daily.
Case Trial By Special Judges:
Every offence mentioned in Section 3(1)shall be tried by the Special Judge for the area within which it was committed. When trying any case, a Special Judge may also try any offence other than what is specified in S. 3, which the accused may be, under Cr.P.C. be charged at the same trial. The Special Judge has to hold the trial of an offence on day-to-day basis. However, while complying with foretasted, it is to be seen that the Cr.P.C. is not bifurcated.
Section 5: Procedure and powers of special Judge.
The following are the powers of the Special Judge:
He may take cognizance of the offences without the accused being commissioned to him for trial. In trying the accused persons, shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Cr.P.C. for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrate. he may with a view to obtain the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concered in or privy to an offence, tender pardon to such person provided that he would make full and true disclosure of the whole circumstances within his knowledge or in respect to any person related to the offence.
Except as for S. 2(1), the provisions of Cr.P.C. shall apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge. Hence, the court of the Special Judge shall be deemed to be a Court of Session and the person conducting a prosecution before a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor.
The provisions of secs. 326 and 475of the Cr.P.C. shall apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge and for purpose of the said provisions, a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a magistrate.
A Special Judge may pass a sentence authorized by law for the punishment of the offence of which a person is convicted.
A Special Judge, while trying any offence punishable under the Act, shall exercise all powers and functions exercised by a District Judge under the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance,1944.
Power to try summarily: Where a Special Judge tries any offence specified in Sec. 3(1), alleged to have been committed by a public servanet in relation to the contravention of any special order referred to in Sec.12-A(1) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 or all orders referred to in sub-section (2)(a) of that section then the special judge shall try the offence in a summarily way and the provisions of s. 262 to 265 (both inclusive) of the said code shall as far as may be apply to such trial. Provided that in the case of any conviction in a summary trial under this section this shall be lawful for the Special Judge to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year. However, when at the commencement of or in the course of a summary trial it appears to the Special Judge that the nature of the case is such that a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding one year may have to be passed or it is undesirable to try the case summarily, the Special judge shall record all order to that effect and thereafter recall any witnesses who may have been examined and proceed to hear and re-hear the case in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the said code for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates. Moreover, there shall be no appeal by a convicted person in any case tried summarily under this section in which the Special Judge passes a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding one month and of fine not exceeding Rs. 2000.

Iowa Highway 152

Iowa Highway 152 (Iowa 152) is a very short route which connects Interstate 35 (I-35) and U.S. Route 69 (US 69) near Osceola, Iowa. Through Iowa, I-35 and US 69 are mostly parallel routes; Iowa 152 connects the two routes at the narrowest location between them. The route was formed in 1980 from a portion of Clarke County Road R35 and has not undergone any changes in alignment since its designation.
Route description.
Iowa 152 begins at a diamond interchange along I-35 northwest of Osceola. CR R35 continues along the roadway to the north and west as Iowa 152 heads to the south-southeast. It passes country homes and wooded acreages along a two-lane road. east of I-35, the highway curves to the south as it passes between farms. Just from its eastern end, it curves back to the east and crosses the city limits into Osceola. Iowa 152 ends at an intersection with US 69, which runs along Main Street in Osceola. The rural portion of the highway has an annual average daily traffic of 940 vehicles, while the portion within the city limits handles 1270 vehicles.
History.
Iowa Highway 152 was designated in 1980 from a segment of CR R35. It was entirely paved upon designation and has not undergone any route changes.

David Goggins

David Goggins (born 1975) is a Navy SEAL and former Tactical Air Control Party member TACP who served in Afghanistan and is an ultramarathon runner. After several of his friends died in Afghanistan, Goggins began long-distance running to raise money. In 2005, Goggins entered the 24 hour race in San Diego and was able to run 100 miles in under 19 hours, despite never having run a marathon before. Since then, Goggins has competed in many different long distance running events such as the Las Vegas Marathon and the Badwater 135 miler, where he placed highly. By November, 2008, Goggins had raised $200,000 for the soldiers' families.
In 2008 he was named a "Hero of Running" by Runner's World.
In 2012, David took on the challenge of beating the world record for the most pull-ups done in 24 hours, the main aim of the challenge was to raise money for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. After 6 hours and 30 minutes in, David had completed 2011 pullups (halfway to the record). By 9:15 pm, after 13.5 hours David completed pull-up 2588. He had been in considerable pain for hours as a severe bulge burst through the skin of his right wrist. A medical x-ray at 10:30pm confirmed a right extensor polycis complex partial tear. The pull-up bar David used for the Guinness challenge was poorly designed. David used a totally different bar during the months of training prior to this event. Despite not beating the record Goggins managed to raise more than $20,000 for his chosen charity.
On November 27, 2012, he completed 3,207 pull-ups in 12 hours, but had to stop due to an injury in his right palm. On January 20, 2013, in Brentwood, TN, David broke the world record for the most pull-ups done in 24 hours. He completed 4,025 pull-ups in 17 hours, and set a new world record. It was David's third attempt at breaking the record.

Tomasi–Kanade factorization

The Tomasi–Kanade factorization is the seminal work by Carlo Tomasi and Takeo Kanade in the early 1990s. It charted out an elegant and simple solution based on a SVD-based factorization scheme for analysing image measurements of a rigid object captured from different views using a weak perspective camera model. The crucial observation made by authors was that if all the measurements (i.e., image co-ordinates of all the points in all the views) are collected in a single matrix, the point trajectories will reside in a certain subspace. The dimension of the subspace in which the image data resides is a direct consequence of two factors: 
The low-dimensionality of the subspace is mirrored (captured) trivially as reduced rank of the measurement matrix. This reduced rank of measurement matrix can be motivated from the fact that, the position of the projection of an object point on the image plane is constrained as the motion of each point is globally described by a precise geometric model.
Method.
The rigid-body factorization introduced in provides a description of 3D structure of a rigid object in terms of a set of feature points extracted from salient image features. After tracking the points throughout all the images composing the temporal sequence, a set of trajectories is available. These trajectories are constrained globally at each frame by the rigid transformation which the shape is undergoing, i.e., trajectory of every point will have similar profile.
Let the location of a point "j" in a frame "i" be defined as p"ij" = ("x""ij", "y""ij")T where "x""ij" and "y"ij are horizontal and vertical image co-ordinates respectively .
A compact representation of the image measurements can be expressed by collecting all the non-homogeneous co-ordinates in a single matrix, called the observation matrix P such that
P is a 2"F" × "P" matrix, where "F" is the number of frames and "P" the number of feature points. Ideally, the observation matrix, should contain perfect information about the object being tracked. Unfortunately, in practice, most state-of-art trackers can only provide point tracks that are incomplete (due to occlusion) and inaccurate (due to sensor noise) if placed in an unstructured environment.
As mentioned earlier, the central premise behind the factorization approach is that a measurement matrix P is rank limited. Further, it is possible to factor P into two sub-matrices: a motion and a shape matrix, M and S of size "2F × r" and "N × r" respectively.
The size and structure of S generally depends on the shape properties (for example whether it is rigid or non-rigid) and M depends both on the type of camera model we assume and the shape properties. The essence of factorization method is computing
The optimal "r"-rank approximation of P with respect to the Frobenius norm can be found out using a SVD-based scheme.

Württemberg T 5

In 1908 the Royal Württemberg State Railways placed an order with the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen for a powerful passenger tank locomotive. Classified as the Württemberg T 5, this superheated engine was designed for duties on Württemberg's main and branch lines and had the very long fixed wheelbase of 4,000 mm in order to give the locomotive smooth riding qualities. By 1920 a total of 96 engines had been manufactured. In 1919, three examples had to be give to France; the remaining 93 were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and 89 survived into the Deutsche Bundesbahn fleet. From 1959 they began to be retired. The last one was taken out of service in 1963 and was kept at Aulendorf as a museum engine until 1968. This last example was then scrapped as well.
The Württemberg T 5 proved itself very well and was occasionally even used to haul expresses on the "Gäubahn (Stuttgart–Singen)" between Immendingen and Stuttgart. No locomotives have been preserved.

Karl M. Baer

Karl M. Baer (20 May 1885, Arolsen, Germany – 26 June 1956, Bat Yam, Israel) was a German-Israeli author, social worker, reformer, suffragette and Zionist. Born female and named Martha Baer he became, in December 1906, one of the first people to undergo sex-change surgery, and one of the first, in January 1907, to gain full legal recognition of his gender identity and to have a new birth certificate issued reflecting his new gender. Baer wrote notes for sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld on his experiences growing up as a girl while feeling inside that he was male. Together they developed these notes into the semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical "Aus eines Mannes Mädchenjahren" ("Man's Years as a Young Girl") (1907) which was published under the pseudonym N.O. Body. Baer also gained the right to marry and did so in October 1907.
Life.
Martha Baer.
Martha Baer studied political economy, sociology and pedagogy in Berlin and Hamburg, and became a social worker ("Volkspflegerin") and confirmed Suffragette. In May 1904 he was sent to Galicia under the auspices of the Hamburg chapter of the B'nai B'rith, to campaign against the trafficking of women from poor countries and for the rights of all women to education. Here, in Lemberg (now Lviv), Martha met the equally active Beile Halpern, who he was later to marry (as Karl Baer).
Baer's work included activism among local women. He encouraged them to campaign for kindergarten and school provision, which would allow women to hold jobs outside the home and reduce the financial hardship that prompted some to traffic their daughters or send them into service. Baer worked to oblige the authorities along established human trafficking paths to check ID documents and combat illegal movement. He also promoted the women's education movement, and became well known as a reformist throughout eastern Europe and Germany.
Baer had initially been sent to Galicia for two years; he returned to Germany after only one, having attracted censure for his male body language, argumentative style, and forceful advocacy of the cause. According to case notes by Magnus Hirschfeld, Baer then transitioned to his male identity and began living as a man. He was diagnosed as a man living in a woman's body after accidental hospitalization, when his female anatomy was discovered; at the same hospital he underwent multi-stage rudimentary sex-change surgery in October 1906. After convalescence he was released from hospital in December 1906, with a medical certificate of his new gender. His new identity was confirmed by the courts in Arolsen (his birthplace) on 8 January 1907.
Karl M. Baer.
Karl Baer retained the middle initial "M", ostensibly stemming from 'Martha', to connect him to his earlier publications under the name M Baer. In later life he said the letter stood for 'Max'; on his gravestone the middle name is given as 'Meir.' In October 1907 he married Beile Halpern; she died in March 1909, and he remarried, with Elza Max (1887–1947). From 1908 to 1911 Baer was an insurance sales agent; on January 1, 1911 he took up a post as Consul for Jewish Life in Berlin. In December 1920 he became director of the Berlin Section of the Loge B'nai B'rith, a post he held until the Section's forcible closure by the Gestapo on 19 April 1937. Baer was by then an important figure in Jewish society, and his influence on cultural life brought him into conflict with the Nazi administration. He was allowed to emigrate with his wife in June 1938 to Palestine, later to become Israel, where he worked between 1942 and 1950 as an accountant. By 1950 he was going blind and had to give up his job; nothing more is documented about him up to his death in 1956. He is buried in the Kirjat-Schaul-Friedhof in Tel Aviv under the name Karl Meir Baer.
Book and Film.
As part of his analysis and therapy, Baer wrote notes for Hirschfeld on his experiences growing up as a girl while feeling inside that he was male. He and Hirschfeld together worked up these notes into the semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical "Aus eines Mannes Mädchenjahren", "Memoirs of a man's maiden years", published in 1907 under the pseudonym 'N.O. Body.' Details of Baer's background were also changed to prevent readers identifying him from the text. Hirschfeld, a keen advocate of the notion of a 'third sex', to which anyone uncomfortable with gender norms or sexual dichotomy could attribute themselves, hoped the book would explain the dilemma that many intersexed children suffered when forced into a two-gender system. The book went through several reprints and translations, earning Baer a continuing income in later life. Later editions, especially those published after the First World War, were rewritten in light of shifts in social acceptance and to fulfil new social and political aims.
In 1919 Karl Grune adapted Baer's book into a fictional autobiography, and into the script for a silent film starring the German actress Erika Glässner (1890–1959) as "Nobody". No copy of the film seems to have survived the Nazi period and Second World War.
Writer Hermann Simon, whose aunts and mother were friends of Baer and his wife, wrote a mini-book, "Wer ist Nobody?" ("Who is Nobody?") for inclusion in a 1993 print edition of "Aus eines Mannes Mädchenjahren"
An English translation by Deborah Simon, based on a German post-war reprint, was published in 2005 under the name "Memoirs of a Man's Maiden Years".

BlueFire Renewables

BlueFire Renewables (previously BlueFire Ethanol) is a biofuel company that produces a cellulose-to-ethanol solution using wood waste, agricultural residue and municipal waste. The company is headquartered in Irvine, California and is publicly traded in the U.S. on the OTC Bulletin Board under the ticker symbol "BFRE".
On August 17, 2010, BlueFire Ethanol Fuels rebranded itself as BlueFire Renewables.
Technology.
BlueFire Ethanol employs what it calls a "concentrated acid hydrolysis" process of converting waste material to ethanol. The technology, developed by and licensed from Arkenol Fuels in Orange County, California, reduces waste material to minuscule dimensions, where it is combined with sulfuric acid. This releases lignin structures within the biomass, where the sugar and acid are separated. The sugar goes into a yeast-fermenting process that results in its conversion to ethanol.
Projects.
In 2007, BlueFire Ethanol received US$40 million funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to construct a per year cellulosic ethanol plant in Fulton, MS.
In 2008, the company unveiled plans to create a network of ethanol refineries located at landfills around the world. Under this plan, the landfill operators would receive US$6.00 per ton for the removal of their trash for processing into ethanol.
In 2009, Bluefire announced a teaming agreement with Solazyme, a renewable oil production company and leading algal synthetic biology company, that sugars produced through BlueFire's patented process will be used by Solazyme to produce various oils for fuel production.

Last Day of World War One

The Last Day of World War One is an episode in the 2008 season of the Television series Timewatch. The programme was a co-production between the Open University and the BBC and aired in November 2008 on BBC 2. The material was presented by Michael Palin who "reveals the shocking truth that soldiers continued to be killed in battle for many hours after the Armistice had been signed." Palin recounts the personal stories of the last soldiers to die in the final days, hours and minutes of World War I.
The programme commences with a brief mention of Major General William M. Wright of the United States 89th Division who, according to the Palin, sacrificed lives storming the town of Stenay simply so his troops could have a bath; "... that lunatic decision cost something like 300 casualties" according to American historical author Joseph E. Persico. 
The German 1918 Spring Offensive was Germany's last attempt to force the British and French to capitulate before the expected arrival of overwhelming American forces. The gamble almost succeeded but the allies first held and then, in July at the River Marne. pushed back the Germans. On 8 August - "The Black Day of the German Army", the British launched their counter-attack at Amiens. The Germans were forced back and would never recover. They had suffered extremely high casualties in their offensives; the allied naval blockade was threatening starvation; revolution at home meant troops were fighting both the enemy and their own countrymen; and now American troops were arriving at the front at a rate of 300,000 each month.
Faced with disaster, the German Government dispatched a civilian peace delegation under Matthias Erzberger. On Thursday, 7 November French soldiers on the Front line near La Capelle witnessed the approach of several German cars bearing white flags. The delegation was escorted through the devastated French landscape via Guise and onto Homblières from where they were placed on a train. The train was routed through Tergnier to a gun siding by Rethondes in the forest of Compiègne and the personal train carriage of Marshal Foch, supreme commander of the Allied armies.
Foch was in no mood to compromise and greeted the delegation: "What do you want from me?". The Germans stated that they were there to negotiate an armistice. Foch replied that as far as he was concerned there would be no negotiation - they were there to receive his terms. A meeting was arranged for the next day from whence the Germans would have 72 hours, from the 8th to 11th, to agree to Foch's terms; Erzberger suggested an immediate ceasefire but this was refused by Foch.
Foch conceded virtually nothing during the ensuing talks. Erzberger was required to telegraph the terms back to the Supreme Command and was told to accept any terms as the situation was so grave; the messages were uncoded and were read by the Allies. At 5:10 am 11 November 1918 the two sides signed and the news was sent around the world that hostilities would cease at 11:00 am.

William Gouge

William Gouge (1575–1653) was an English clergyman and author. He was a minister and preacher at St Ann Blackfriars for 45 years, from 1608, and a member of the Westminster Assembly from 1643.
Life.
He was born in Stratford-le-Bow, Middlesex, and baptised on 6 November 1575. He was educated at Felsted, St. Paul's School, Eton College, and King's College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1598 and M.A. in 1601.
Before moving to London, he was a Fellow and lecturer at Cambridge, where he caused a near-riot by his advocacy of Ramism over the traditional methods of Aristotle. (This story about Gouge, who lectured on logic, is related in Wilbur Samuel Howell's "Logic and Rhetoric in England 1500-1700" (1956) as an account from Samuel Clarke, and is not reliably dated.)
At Blackfriars, he was initially assistant to Stephen Egerton (c.1554-1622), taking over as lecturer.
He proposed an early dispensational scheme. He took an interest in Sir Henry Finch's "Calling of the Jews", and published it under his own name; this led to a spell of imprisonment in 1621, since the publication displeased James I of England.
Already nearly 70 years old, he attended the Westminster Assembly regularly, and was made chairman in 1644 of the committee set up to draft the Westminster Confession. The other original members of the committee were John Arrowsmith, Cornelius Burges, Jeremiah Burroughs, Thomas Gataker, Thomas Goodwin, Joshua Hoyle, Thomas Temple, and Richard Vines He also acted as an Assessor.
"Of Domesticall Duties" and the family.
"Of Domesticall Duties" (1622) was a popular and thorough text of its time discussing family life. It argued that the wife although above the children is below the husband and the father figure "is a king in his owne household", and was an important conduct book of its period, running to later editions.
Gouge himself was father to 13 children. His wife Elizabeth, née Calton, died shortly after the birth of the last of them. They had married in the early 17th century, in effect by arrangement, when Gouge was put under pressure by his family. Elizabeth had been brought up by the wife of an Essex minister, John Huckle, and was eulogised after her death.
His teaching on female submission may have caused some discomfort within his own congregation. He considered adultery equally bad in both genders, and encouraged love matches.
Other writings.
According to Ann Thompson, "The Whole Armor of God" (1615) illustrates the shift from "transcendent faith" in William Perkins and Samuel Ward, to "immanent faith" in a succeeding generation of Puritan writers.
In "God's Three Arrows: Plague, Famine, Sword" (1625 and 1631), he mentioned the idea that plague finds victims in poorer people, because they are more easily spared. They should not be allowed to flee affected areas, and nor should magistrates and the aged; but others may properly do so. In common with other Protestant theologians of the time, he supported the idea of holy war.
His massive "Commentary on the Whole Epistle to the Hebrews" appeared in 1655 in three volumes, replete with detail and sermon outlines. It was seen into print by his eldest son, Thomas Gouge (c.1605-1681), It was reprinted by James Nichol of Edinburgh in 1866.
Family.
Five of his uncles were noted Puritans: Laurence Chaderton and William Whitaker married sisters of his mother, while Nathaniel, Samuel and Ezekiel Culverwell were her brothers. His cousin, Mary Culverwell, married Ezekiel Cheever.

Lord's Island

Lord's Island, which is one of the seven islands on Derwent Water in Keswick, Cumbria, England, got its name from the Earls of Derwentwater who used to live here. Not only was there a fine house on this island but it also had a drawbridge which was used to cross to the mainland.
This fine house gradually fell into a state of disrepair when the Earls moved away, and only its foundations can still be seen today. The stone from this dilapidated house was moved into Keswick and used to make a meeting hall—this building, which is still standing today in the middle of the market square, is now the home of the Tourist Information Centre and is known as Moot Hall.
The last Earl, James Radclyffe, only managed to visit the area once, as having raised an army he decided to side with the Jacobites in 1714. He was, however, defeated at Preston and beheaded in 1716.

Baden VI b

The Baden VI b was the first German tank locomotive with a 2-6-2 wheel arrangement. It was developed by the firm of Maffei for the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways in order to provide faster services on the Höllentalbahn. As a result the first six batches were given a firebox sloping to the rear. One striking feature was also the connecting pipe between the two steam domes. 
After the first delivery of 15 examples from Maffei, the remaining batches, 2 to 11, were produced by the Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over 164 engines, most of which survived World War II. The Deutsche Bundesbahn ended up with 117 vehicles. Their retirement from the DB began in 1957 and was completed when 75 299 was withdrawn in 1962. The Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany took its engines out of service between 1955 and 1965.
Within this class there were differences between the eleven individual batches in terms of overall length, weight, the height of the boiler axis above the rails and the shape of the water tanks. 
None of this class is known to have been preserved.

1958 German football championship

The 54th German football championship was the culmination of the football season in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957-58. FC Schalke 04 were crowned champions for a seventh time after a group stage and a final. 
It was the clubs first title since 1942 and also its last, as of 2012. It was won in impressive fashion, "Schalke" winning all its four finals games, scoring 19 goals and conceding only one; a reminder of how the club dominated German football in the 1930s and early 40's. On the strength of this title, "Schalke" participated in the 1958–59 European Cup, where it was knocked out in the quarter finals by Atlético Madrid.
For "Hamburg", it was the second lost final in a row, having lost 4-1 in 1957 to Borussia Dortmund and having to wait another two seasons for its first title since 1928.
The format used to determine the German champion was the same as in the 1957 season. Nine clubs qualified for the tournament, with the runners-up of "West" and "Southwest" having to play a qualification match. The remaining eight clubs then played a single round in two groups of four, with the two group winners entering the final.

Gnome deities

In many campaign settings for the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game, the gnome pantheon of gods, also called the Lords of the Golden Hills, consists of the leader, Garl Glittergold, as well as Baervan Wildwanderer, Baravar Cloakshadow, Flandal Steelskin, Gaerdal Ironhand, Nebelun, Segojan Earthcaller, and Urdlen. The Glutton, Gelf Darkhearth, Ril Cleverthrush and Sheyanna Flaxenstrand, being introduced in a supplemental book, are not considered canon to the pantheon, although they are included here for completion.
Baervan Wildwanderer.
In the "Dungeons & Dragons" roleplaying game, Baervan Wildwanderer ( ) is the gnome deity of Forests, Travel, and Nature. Baervan lives in the gnomish realm of the "Golden Hills" on the plane of Bytopia. Baervan's clerics wear wood-brown clothes and green caps. His sacred animal is the raccoon. Baervan's holy days are on the full moon, and he is worshipped in forest clearings. Treasured items are sacrificed to him monthly.
Baervan Wildwanderer was first detailed in Roger E. Moore's article "The Gnomish Point of View," in "Dragon" #61 (TSR, 1982). In "Dragon" #92 (December 1984), Gary Gygax indicated this as one of the deities legal for the Greyhawk setting. He also appeared in the original "Unearthed Arcana" (1985).
Baervan Wildwanderer was detailed in the book "Monster Mythology" (1992), including details about his priesthood. His role in the cosmology of the Planescape campaign setting was described in "On Hallowed Ground" (1996). He received a very detailed description for his role in the Forgotten Realms in "Demihuman Deities" (1998). He is described as one of the good deities that celestials can serve in the supplement "Warriors of Heaven" (1999). Baervan Wildwanderer's role in the Forgotten Realms is revisited in "Faiths and Pantheons" (2002).
Baervan owns a raccoon named Chiktika Fastpaws, according to a female avariel (winged elf) cleric/mage character named Aerie in the AD&D computer role-playing game "".
Baravar Cloakshadow.
In the "Dungeons & Dragons" roleplaying game, Baravar Cloakshadow (BARE-uh-vahr CLOKE-sha-doh) is the gnomish deity of illusions, protection, and deception. He creates traps and illusions of stunning complexity and cunning. He is somewhat mean-spirited compared to most of the other gnomish gods, and his pranks may cause even his friends real pain, at least emotionally. He genuinely hates the kobold, goblinoid, and orcish races, believing they cannot be expected to reform. His symbol is a cloak and dagger.
Publication history.
Baravar Cloakshadow was first detailed in the book "Monster Mythology" (1992), including details about his priesthood. His role in the cosmology of the Planescape campaign setting was described in "On Hallowed Ground" (1996). He received a very detailed description for his role in the Forgotten Realms in "Demihuman Deities" (1998).
Baravar Cloakshadow's role in the Forgotten Realms is revisited in "Faiths and Pantheons" (2002).
Description.
Baravar appears as a young, dark-haired gnome with beady eyes. He is very alert and vigilant, and always dressed in dark clothing. He is a thief, though not a terribly competent one, making up for his lack of physical expertise with confounding illusions. He wields a magical poison-dripping dagger called "Nightmare", and a magical garment called the "Shadowcloak".
In many campaign settings, the gnome pantheon of gods, also called the Lords of the Golden Hills, consists of the leader Garl Glittergold, as well as Baervan Wildwanderer, Baravar Cloakshadow, Flandal Steelskin, Gaerdal Ironhand, Nebelun, Segojan Earthcaller, and Urdlen. Baravar is allied with all of the gods of his pantheon, except Urdlen. Baravar works with the former gnomish god of magic, Segojan Earthcaller, to advance the arcane arts, and with Calladuran Smoothhands, for many svirfneblin are experts in magical deception. Gaerdal disapproves of Baravar's deceptive nature, and sometimes seeks to thwart his schemes.
Baravar's enemies include Abbathor, Kuraulyek, Kurtulmak, Urdlen, and the various goblin gods, but dislikes the deities of all evil humanoid races. He does not restrain himself in expressing this hatred either, visiting all manner of cruel pranks upon them when he can.
Realm.
Baravar lives in the gnomish realm of the "Golden Hills" on the plane of Bytopia. His domain there is called the Hidden Knoll; it is filled with tricks and nonlethal traps, which Baravar continually changes. Those able enough to avoid these hazards are permitted to freely take the treasures Baravar stows there for that purpose.
Dogma.
Baravar teaches that deception is the only reliable way to find safety in the dangerous world. His followers are encouraged to develop their own abilities of deception and to avoid complete trust in anyone. Followers of Baravar may hope for the best, but they must be prepared for the worst. Harsh practical jokes are encouraged as a means of vengeance. Baravar's followers try to maintain the facade of being law-abiding citizens, though they are taught that laws should be readily discarded if it is more convenient to do so. They devote themselves to their art and to those they love.
Worshippers.
Baravar is the primary gnomish god of magic, and as such he is revered by gnome wizards of all subraces, as well as those gnomes who create magical items and all those who must survive by their wits. Those who often have to battle kobolds and goblins revere him especially. Where evil humanoids are concerned, "Do unto them before they have a chance to do unto you" is both their motto and their god's.
Clergy.
Clerics of Baravar work to further refine illusion magic, and they quest for new illusion magic and magical items. They are researchers and adventurers. They are encouraged to be proficient in camouflage, disguise, and hiding. They are well regarded among gnomes for their efforts against kobolds and goblins. Dwarves often exhibit dislike of Baravar's clerics, who with their deceitful ways embody all that a typical dwarf distrusts about gnomes.
Novice clerics of Baravar are known as the Cloaked. Full priests are given the title of Illusory. Apart from that, they have a wide variety of titles, changing them as suits their purposes in order to disguise exactly who leads whom. Specialty priests are known as Hoodwinkers.
On ceremonial occasions, Baravar's clerics wear black hooded cloaks, gray cloth masks, and carry ornate silver daggers with wavy blades. They used tarnished miniature versions of these daggers as their holy symbols. Adventuring clerics wear the garb of rogues, including dark gray or black cloaks.
Temples.
Baravar's temples are never presented as such, being usually disguised as some unrelated type of building and further cloaked with hidden doors, traps, and illusions.
Holy days.
Baravar's holy nights are when Luna is new.
Rituals.
Once a month, when the Mistress is hidden in the sky, Baravar is honored in a ritual known as the Cloaking. The location and nature of this ceremony is constantly changing. Most often it is performed in public places, with the celebrants challenged to prevent the uninitiated from ever realizing what's going on. For this reason, unexplained gatherings of gnomes are sometimes referred to as "meetings of the Illusory."
Typical offerings to the Sly One are realistic illusions depicting objects the casters have sensed. The more convincing these illusions are, the better the Master of Illusion is pleased.
Callarduran Smoothhands.
Callarduran Smoothhands is the gnome god of the earth in the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game.
He is the patron deity of the svirfneblin (deep gnomes), and is not very popular among other gnome subraces. Unlike other gods of the Underdark, he is not an outcast. He voluntarily led his people to the depths as a means of encouraging diversity among the gnomes.
Callarduran Smoothhands is a True Neutral Intermediate Power. His symbol is a golden ring with a ruby star on it.
Publication history.
Callarduran Smoothhands was first detailed in the book "Monster Mythology" (1992), including details about his priesthood. His role in the cosmology of the Planescape campaign setting was described in "On Hallowed Ground" (1996). He received a very detailed description for his role in the Forgotten Realms in "Demihuman Deities" (1998).
Callarduran Smoothhands was described in "Defenders of the Faith" (2000). Callarduran Smoothhands's role in the Forgotten Realms is revisited in "Faiths and Pantheons" (2002).
Relationships.
Callarduran Smoothhands remains allied with the rest of the gnome pantheon (with the exception of Urdlen), and has also forged alliances with other deities of the Underdark who share a common interest in working together, such as Eilistraee (the drow elven goddess of good drow), Psilofyr (the patron of myconids), and Shevarash (the elven deity of retribution who holds a profound hatred for drow). His primary enemies are the drow deities, especially Lolth. He also opposes deities venerated by evil humanoids also residing in the Underdark, for instance the orc and goblin pantheon, the deities of illithids, kuo-toa, beholders, "etcetera".
Worshippers.
Clergy.
Priests of Callarduran Smoothhands are regarded by their kin as their dedicated protectors and wise councillors. Many also lead small warbands seeking to neutralise drow threats. They are assisted by the Wardens of the Webspinners, an order of warriors and priests dedicated to combating the followers of Lolth the Spider Queen.
The ceremonial garb of the priests of Callarduran Smoothhands is simple grey robes adorned with small (usually red) gems, a steel or mithral circlet worn on the brow, and steel sandals as footwear. The holy symbol a priest carries is a ruby whose size is indicative of the priest's rank in the church. Novice priests are known as "the Unworked". The ranks of the church (in ascending order) are: First Facet, Second Facet, Third Facet, Fourth Facet, Fifth Facet, Sixth Facet, Seventh Facet, Eighth facet, Ruby, and the Smoothed.
Temples and rituals.
When practicing the rites of the god, the priests only communicate in whispers, and their temples are domed, so as to enhance their echoes.
Flandal Steelskin.
Flandal Steelskin is the gnome deity of mining, smithing, and fitness. His symbol is a flaming hammer. He appears as a balding, aging gnome with skin the color of blue mithral steel, eyes like flaming coals, and hair of brilliant blue-silver. He wears a leather apron over the rest of his clothes, and carries "Rhondang", an intelligent axe-backed hammer made of yellowish metal. He is the strongest of the gnomish pantheon and is able to sniff out veins of any ore with his prodigious nose. As such, he is the patron of gnomish warriors, miners and metalworkers.
Gaerdal Ironhand.
Gaerdal Ironhand is the gnome deity of protection, vigilance, and combat. He lives in the gnomish realm of the "Golden Hills" on the plane of Bytopia.
Gelf Darkhearth.
Gelf Darkhearth is the gnomish deity of entropy and revenge. He was introduced in the "Races of Stone" supplement book.
Gelf is Garl Glittergold's brother, and rarely have two brothers been more bitter rivals. Gelf, depicted as a gray-skinned dwarf with a black beard, takes obsessive delight in opposing everything his brother attempts. This compulsion puts Gelf in the tragic position of tearing down the gnome society he loves, just to thwart Garl Glittergold. Gelf isn't evil, but he feels compelled to destroy everything Garl holds dear. Gelf is an angry, sorrowful deity, and he attracts followers of similar temperament. The reason for Gelf's attitude and rivalry with Garl is not known, but it is possibly because they both covet the Gnomish goddess of love Sheyanna Flaxenstrand. Gelf's holy symbol is a black anvil that is splt in two, set against a murky purple background. His favored weapon is the warhammer.
Worshipers.
Would-be clerics of Gelf are individually recruited by senior clerics who sense kindred spirits. Those who follow Gelf are rebels so committed to their cause that they would do anything to defeat the authorities they despise.
Gelf's prayers are often wordless ululations—long strings of vowel sounds. To nonbelievers, they sound like gibberish, but the exact order of sounds has meaning to the faithful.
Gelf's temples aren't hidden, but they are out of the way and placed so that Gelf's worshipers aren't seen coming and going. Most gnomes know where to find a temple to Gelf (assuming one is nearby), but few can think of a reason to go there.
Many of Gelf's rites seek to bestow a curse or ill will on a nonbeliever. Few are known outside the fairly insular circle of Gelf's worshipers—with one exception: Almost every gnome warrior knows the Rite of the Adroit, a brief group ceremony that steels the minds of gnomes to the chaos of war.
If someone has hatched a plot against one of Garl Glittergold's temples—or against a thriving gnome community—Gelf Darkhearth is probably behind it. He takes particular glee in using Garl's faithful against him, duping adventurers into doing his bidding.
Heralds and Allies.
The herald of Gelf is a 20th-level fiendish gnome rogue. His allies are succubus demons, green slaadi, and death slaadi.
The Glutton.
The Glutton is the gnomish deity of disaster and greed. He was introduced in the "Races of Stone" supplemental book.
The Glutton is usually depicted as a massive, ravenous badger or wolverine. The Glutton figures prominently in the bedtime stories gnomes tell naughty children -- "Go to sleep or The Glutton will get you!" The Glutton is blamed whenever a burrow collapses or another misfortune befalls the gnomes. It is said that The Glutton was once a gnome who was cursed with a hideous form and a desire to consume the gnomes and all they hold dear (why is not known). His holy symbol is a gaping, fanged mouth surrounded by what looks like a golden band, and what appears to be a smear of pink blood behind it. His favored weapon is the heavy mace.
Worshipers.
The Glutton's few clerics are all secretive cult leaders, for no gnomes would willingly allow worshipers of The Glutton into their burrows. New clerics are recruited from among the mad and the hopeless.
Cultists of The Glutton take his name literally when they pray, stuffing themselves with food as they make profane utterances to their evil deity.
The Glutton has no temples. His cultists meet wherever they can find a measure of secrecy.
Rites require a level of organization that The Glutton is uninterested in. If his cultists want a ceremony to perform, they have to create it themselves.
The Glutton's goals are straightforward enough that he doesn't send followers on quests. But the cults that act in his name might send adventurers on quests to acquire more evil power
Herald and Allies.
The herald of The Glutton is a mighty balor. Allies are howlers, greater barghests, and nalfeshnee demons.
Urdlen.
Urdlen is the gnome deity of greed and blood. It manifests as an enormous blind mole.
