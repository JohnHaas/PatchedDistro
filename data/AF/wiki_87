Royal Audiencia of Lima

The Royal Audiencia and Chancery of Lima () was a superior court in the New World empire of Spain, located in the city of Lima, capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru. It was created on November 20, 1542 as was the viceroyalty itself, by the Emperor Charles V. The Audiencia began functioning in 1543 and initially had jurisdiction over the entire viceroyalty—virtually all of Spanish-controlled South America and Panama. Later other "audiencias" were established in the Viceroyalty. The Audiencia functioned until 1821 when the forces of José de San Martín entered Lima.
Subsequent divisions.
In 1559 part of the territory of the Lima Audiencia was separated and given over to a new Audiencia of Charcas, and in 1563 an Audiencia of Quito was established with jurisdiction over the northern territories of the viceroyalty. By the time the "Recopilación de Leyes de Indias" was published in 1680, the territory of the Lima Audiencia was defined in Law V of Title 15 as:
In the City of the Kings Lima, head of the provinces of Peru, shall reside another of our Royal Audiencias and Chancellery, with a viceroy, governor and captain general and lieutenant ours, who shall be president; eight judges of civil cases ["oidores"]; four judges of criminal cases ["alcaldes del crimen"]; and two crown attorneys ["fiscales"], one for civil cases and one for criminal ones; a bailiff ["alguacil mayor"]; a lieutenant of the Gran Chancellor; and the other necessary ministers and officials; and which shall have for district the coast from said city until the Kingdom of Chile exclusive, and until the Port of Paita inclusive; and inland to San Miguel de Piura, Cajamarca, Chachapoyas, Moyobamba and Los Motilones, inclusive and until El Collao, exclusive, along the boarders determined for the Royal Audiencia of la Plata, and the City of Cusco and its , inclusive, sharing boarders in the north with the Royal Audiencia of Quito; in the south with the one of La Plata and in the west with the South Sea and in the east with undiscovered provinces, according to what is contained in, and pointed out, in Law 14 of this title.

Under arms

Under arms describes a state of military readiness (actual or ceremonial). Typically, troops are considered "under arms" when they are in uniform, on duty, and carrying a weapon (rifle, side-arm, or sword), as opposed to being in uniform, on duty, but not carrying a weapon.
Soldiers not actually carrying a weapon but wearing a service belt or web gear associated with carrying weapons may be considered to be symbolically "under arms".
Soldiers normally remove headgear while indoors; however, soldiers who are under arms normally wear their headgear indoors, with a few exceptions.

HD 43848 is a 9th magnitude K-type subgiant star located approximately 123 light-years away in the constellation of Columba. The star is less massive than the Sun.
On October 29, 2008, radial velocity measurements made with the MIKE echelle spectrograph on the 6.5-m Magellan II (Clay) telescope revealed the presence of a companion of at least 25 Jupiter masses orbiting the star. Initially thought to be a brown dwarf, astrometric measurements reveal that the true mass of the object is 120 Jupiter masses, implying that it is likely to be a red dwarf star.

James Stephen (civil servant)

Sir James Stephen (3 January 1789 – 14 September 1859) was the British under-secretary of state for the colonies from 1836 to 1847. He was instrumental in implementing the slavery abolition act.
Early life.
Stephen was born at Lambeth, the third son of James Stephen and brother to George Stephen (1794–1879). An attack of smallpox during James' infancy caused a permanent weakness of eyesight. He was under various schoolmasters, including John Prior Estlin and the Rev. Henry Jowett of Little Dunham, Norfolk. In 1806 he entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he learnt as little as if he had passed the time "at the Clarendon Hotel in Bond Street." He took the LL.B. degree in 1812, having been called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 11 November 1811. His father, who was just leaving the bar, transferred
some practice to his son, who also began to make a digest of colonial laws. Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst, who was in sympathy with the "Clapham Sect," allowed him to inspect official records for the digest, and in 1813 appointed him counsel to the Colonial Office. His duty was to report upon all acts of the colonial legislatures. The work increased, but he was also allowed to practise privately, and in a few years was making £3,000 a year, and in a fair way to the honours of the profession.
Colonial office career.
On 22 December 1814 Stephen married Jane Catherine, daughter of John Venn, rector of Clapham, one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society. In 1822 Stephen had a severe illness caused by overwork. As he was now a
father, he decided in 1825 to accept the offer of the post of permanent counsel to the colonial office and to the board of trade, abandoning his private practice.
In 1834 Stephen was appointed assistant under-secretary of state for the colonies, and in 1836 under-secretary, giving up his position in the board of trade. The duties became onerous. He had a high reputation for his knowledge of constitutional law, and as an administrator. He gained influence with his superiors, and his colleague, Sir Henry Taylor, said that for many years he "literally ruled the colonial empire." The impression of his influence gained him the nicknames of "King Stephen" and "Mr. Over-secretary Stephen;" and he was made the scapegoat for real and supposed errors of the Colonial Office.
Stephen had accepted his position partly with a hope of influence policy on slavery question. When abolition became inevitable, he was called on to draw up the Slavery Abolition Act passed in 1833. Between the noons of Saturday and Monday he dictated an elaborate bill of sixty-six sections. He also was writing for the "Edinburgh Review", and suffered a breakdown.
In later years Stephen was involved in the establishment of government in Canada; and his views are said to have been more liberal than those of the government. Esteemed by his official superiors, he used formality to keep others at a distance. The health of his youngest son induced him in 1840 to take a house at Brighton for his family, to which he could make only weekly visits. From 1842 to 1846 he lived at Windsor, in order to send his sons to Eton. In 1846 he was summoned to Dresden by the illness of his eldest son, who died before his parents could reach him. In 1847 he resigned his opost. He was made a K.C.B. and a privy councillor.
Teaching and writing.
Stephen had meanwhile become known as a writer by a series of articles in the "Edinburgh Review", the first of which (on William Wilberforce) appeared in April 1838. They were written in the intervals of his official work, generally in the early morning. He carefully disavowed any pretence to profound research. The articles had, however, shown considerable historical knowledge as well as literary power. He had partly recovered strength, and was anxious for employment.
In June 1849 Stephen was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge, a chair vacant by the death of William Smyth. He delivered a course of lectures on the history of France during the summers of 1850 and 1851, which were published in 1852, and praised by De Tocqueville. Another severe illness in the summer of 1850 had forced him to spend a winter abroad. From 1855 to 1857 he held a professorship at the East India Company College, Haileybury, which had been sentenced to extinction. He continued to lecture at Cambridge, but the history school then had little prestige.
Retirement and death.
Stephen passed the last years of his life mainly in London. In 1859 his health showed serious symptoms, and he was ordered to Bad Homburg, Prussia. Becoming worse, he started homewards, but died at Koblenz, Prussia on 14 September 1859. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. Sir James Stephen's widow died in 1875. They had five children:
Assessment.
Stephen spent his best years and highest powers in work of which it is impossible that any estimate should be formed. He was a most conscientious and energetic official, but the credit or discredit of the policy which he carried out belongs to those whom he advised. In domestic life he impressed all who knew him by his loftiness of principle. He was a man of the strongest family affections. He sacrificed his own comforts for the benefit of his children, and set before them a constant example of absolute devotion to duty. He began life as a strong evangelical, and never avowedly changed; but his experience of the world, his sympathy with other forms of belief, and his interest in the great churchmen of the Middle Ages led to his holding the inherited doctrine in a latitudinarian sense. He was accused of heresy, when appointed professor at Cambridge, for an "Epilogue" to his "Essays", in which he suggested doubts as to the eternity of hell-fire. The "Essays" are the work by which he is best known, and show a literary faculty to which he could never give full play. The autobiography of Sir Henry Taylor gives an interesting account of his personal character. Taylor, James Spedding, Mr. Aubrey de Vere, and Nassau Senior were his most intimate friends; but he led a recluse and rather ascetic life, and seldom went into society, A bust by Marochetti is in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Valerian Stan

Valerian Stan (b. Sascut, Bacău County, Romania, 1955) is a military officer, human rights activist and civil servant. 
In 1974, he graduated from the "George Bacovia" high school Bacău, and in 1977, the Military School of Infantry Officers, "Nicolae Bălcescu" in Sibiu. At the graduation, he became a lieutenant, and he was assigned to the Bucharest garrison, where he worked for almost eight years. Afterwards, until Nicolae Ceauşescu's downfall in December 1989, he fulfilled administrative functions (fuel-lubricant supply) and functions in the area of labor protection, inside a military detachment of constructions in "the national economy". Also, between 1982 and 1987, he attended the courses of the Faculty of Law of the Bucharest University. Valerian Stan used to be deputy chairman of the Romania's Civic Alliance Movement. 
In 1997, Valerian Stan, then chief of the prime minister’s inspection agency, was fired when he went public with a list of names of all politicians currently residing in luxurious government-owned homes. Many of these politicians are affiliated with the ruling parties and had been savoring their perks since 1990. (See the article by Alina Mungiu-Pippidi on this issue.) Although Stan’s whistleblowing was welcomed by the public, he was dismissed by Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea, who argued that Stan should have prosecuted "real cases of corruption" instead of engaging in media stunts

Cornelius H. DeLamater

Cornelius Henry DeLamater (August 30, 1821 – February 2, 1889) was an industrialist who owned DeLamater Iron Works in New York City. The steam boilers and machinery for the ironclad was built in DeLamater's foundry during the Civil War. Swedish marine engineer and inventor John Ericsson considered DeLamater his closest, most intimate friend.
Life.
Cornelius H. DeLamater was born on August 30, 1821, in Rhinebeck, New York, his family moving to New York City when Cornelius was three years old. His father was hired by a very small iron foundry, the Phoenix Iron Works of James Cunningham on West Street, as cashier and confidential advisor. At 16, Cornelius entered the Phoenix Foundry, and at age 20, upon the death of Cunningham, he formed a co-partnership with Peter Hogg under the name Hogg and DeLamater. This firm continued from 1842 to 1857, when Hogg retired from the business. The firm was re-formed as the DeLamater Iron Works, and moved to the foot of West 13th Street on the West side of Manhattan.
At an early age, DeLamater developed an unusual ability in solving problems that were then developing in regard to steam engineering and machinery. During the Civil War he worked with Capt. John Ericsson in the development of the ironclads and which were constructed in an incredibly short space of time. In time, the DeLamater Iron Works became known as the asylum where inventors and capitalists could go to experiment and attempt new feats. The "Iron Witch" was next constructed, the first iron steamboat. The hot air engine of Capt. Ericsson was first introduced in the ship "Ericsson" which was built entirely by DeLamater. The DeLamater Iron Works was also the place where the first submarine boat, first self-propelled torpedo, first torpedo boat, and the engines for the original "Monitor" were built.
At the time of his death, the DeLamater Iron Works employed over 1000 men.
Eaton's Neck Estate.
DeLamater's leisure moments were spent at Beacon Farm on Eatons Neck, Long Island, New York where he had of choice land on the North Shore of Long Island, and the "finest blooded stock in America" as described by the "New York Times". The DeLamater Estate included everything beyond what is today #325 Asharoken Avenue. This includes the upper half of Asharoken Beach, the Morgan Estate, the Eaton Harbors or Two Acre Zone of Eaton's Neck, and the Bevin Road peninsula in Asharoken. The DeLamater Mansion still stands today on the Eatons Neck peninsula, and was rented in 1942 by French author Antoine de Saint Exupéry who wrote "The Little Prince" while at the mansion. The children and grandchildren of DeLamater also built mansions over time in Eaton's Neck and Asharoken that still stand today, namely "The Point", "The Nest", "The Crest", and "The Hill". The DeLamaters also renovated two existing colonial structures for family estates, namely "Cherry Lawn" and "Oak Leaf".

USS Washoe County (LST-1165)

USS "Washoe County" (LST-1165), previously USS "LST-1165", was a United States Navy landing ship tank (LST) in commission from 1953 to 1971, and which then saw non-commissioned Military Sealift Command service as USNS "Washoe County" (T-LST-1165) in 1973.
Construction and commissioning.
USS "LST-1165" was laid down on 1 December 1952 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation. She was launched on 14 July 1953, sponsored by Mrs. Ralph K. James, and commissioned on 30 November 1953 with Lieutenant Commander Robert R. Davis in command.
Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean service.
In January 1954, "LST-1165" joined the United States Atlantic Fleet and became part of the Atlantic Amphibious Force. After completing training in the vicinity of Hampton Roads, Virginia, in early spring 1954, "LST-1165" became very active in United States Naval Reserve training and made cruises to Miami, Florida; Boston, Massachusetts; New York City; and Havana, Cuba.
During 1955, "LST--1165" participated in many Atlantic Fleet exercises which took her from Labrador to the Caribbean. She also took part in the filming of the motion picture "Away All Boats" at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. On 1 July 1955, USS "LST-1165" was renamed USS "Washoe County" (LST-1165). On 5 November 1955, the ship arrived at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia Beach, Virginia, where she spent the remainder of 1955.
"Washoe County" completed underway preparations at Little Creek on 20 February 1956 and, after a brief stop at Morehead City, North Carolina, sailed on 25 February 1956 for refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She conducted exercises in the Caribbean until 29 April 1956, when she returned to Miami, Florida. For the next few months, "Washoe County" worked along the United States East Coast taking part in various operations.
"Washoe County" departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 August 1956 and headed for the Mediterranean and her first tour with the United States Sixth Fleet. She also visited ports in Spain, Morocco, France, and Tunisia before returning to Hampton Roads on 5 February 1957.
The next three months of 1957 found "Washoe County" operating in the Norfolk area. On 28 March 1957, she headed for the Caribbean and operations at Barbados, St. Thomas, and Puerto Rico. She returned to Morehead City on 14 April 1957 and spent the remainder of 1957 in local operations in the Chesapeake Bay area.
Western Pacific service.
"Washoe County" departed Little Creek on 6 January 1958, stopped briefly at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, then transited the Panama Canal and arrived at San Diego, California, on 27 January 1958. She remained there for the next five months. On 10 June 1958, she began supply runs to Seal Beach, Port Hueneme, and San Nicolas Island, California.
"Washoe County" returned to San Diego on 26 June 1958 for a month's rest before sailing for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 23 July 1958. The ship returned to San Diego on 20 August 1958 and spent the rest of 1958 in operations off the California coast.
During the early months of 1959, "Washoe County" was at San Diego preparing for an upcoming Western Pacific (WestPac) deployment. She set course for Japan on 15 April 1959 and arrived at Sasebo, Japan, on 7 May 1959. Except for a visit to Hong Kong during June 1959, "Washoe County" operated between Okinawa and Japan into the autumn of 1959. She returned to San Diego on 26 November 1959 and conducted local operations in waters off the California coast through the end of the year.
During the first half of 1960, "Washoe County" conducted various operations along the United States West Coast, including Operation Swan Dive off Cape Pendleton; Operation Bay Island off Tacoma, Washington, with the United States Army and United States Air Force; and Operation Shark Bite at San Francisco, California, with United States Marine Corps reservists.
On 1 July 1960, "Washoe County"s home port was changed to Yokosuka, Japan. One month later, she sailed for the Western Pacific; she stopped at Pearl Harbor, then arrived at Iwakuni, Japan, on 3 September 1960. She spent September and October 1960 carrying United States Marine Corps troops and vehicles with stops in Naha and Buckner Bay, Okinawa, and Numazu, Japan. "Washoe County" completed a restricted availability on 17 October 1960 and, after a visit to Hong Kong, took part in Operation Packboard off Okinawa from 11 November 1960 to 19 November 1960. On 7 December 1960, she commenced an overhaul at Yokosuka which lasted into 1957.
"Washoe County" finished her yard work on 8 February 1961 and began training. She then made a visit to Tokyo and remained there until 22 March 1961. The months of April and May were occupied with operations off Vietnam in the South China Sea, and she returned to Japan late in the spring for local operations. From 2 August 1961 to 14 August 1961, "Washoe County" participated in Operation Sharp Edge off Korea. The ship ended 1961 by taking part in Operation Fiesta at San Jose, Mindoro, Philippines, commemorating the 17th anniversary of the landing of United States forces in the Philippine Islands in World War II.
On 17 February 1962, "Washoe County" began her participation in the large-scale Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Exercise Tulungan in the Philippine area which lasted through 20 April 1962. She then devoted the remainder of 1962 to visiting the ports of Keelung, Taiwan; Subic Bay, the Philippines; Hong Kong; and Beppu and Kyūshū, Japan. During July and August 1962, she joined in Operation Seven Seas off Korea. On 8 December 1962, she entered the shipyard at Yokosuka for an overhaul.
She devoted the major portion of 1963 to routine operations and training and from 12 June 1963 to 30 June 1963 participated in her only operation of the year, Operation Flagpole. On 30 September 1963, "Washoe County" rescued 15 men from the foundering Japanese fishing vessel, "Shoyo Maru No. 10", near Miyako Jima.
The year 1964 began with "Washoe County" moored at Yokohama. From 3 January 1964 to 27 January 1964, she underwent upkeep at Yokosuka. An administrative inspection of the ship held on 3 February 1964 was followed by preparations for the upcoming Exercise Back Pack which she conducted from 26 February 1964 to 16 March 1964.
"Washoe County" lifted ammunition from Sasebo to Numazu, Japan, from 10 April 1964 to 17 April 1964. The ship participated in Operation Ligtas from 29 May 1964 to 8 June 1964, then sailed to Hong Kong for a port visit. She spent July 1964 undergoing another physical security inspection plus sea trials.
Vietnam War service.
During August and September 1964, "Washoe County" conducted special operations in the South China Sea off the coast of Vietnam. Following routine operations and training, "Washoe County" visited Beppu, Japan, from 2 December 1964 to 4 December 1964 and, after a force medical inspection and an operational readiness inspection, spent the rest of 1964 at Yokohama.
"Washoe County" spent the first three quarters of 1965 making shuttle trips between Okinawa, Japan, and Vietnam in support of American forces in Vietnam. The loads she carried during the year included Marine Corps, Naval Beach Group, Naval Beach Jumper, and Amphibious Construction Battalion equipment and personnel. Most of the year's last quarter was devoted to a yard overhaul at Yokosuka which began on 16 September 1965 and ended on 10 December 1965. On 27 December 1965, the ship commenced refresher training which continued into 1966.
The ship departed Yokosuka loaded with pontoon barge sections destined for Danang, South Vietnam. Following a short stop in Okinawa, the ship arrived at Danang on 22 February 1966. She then proceeded to Chu Lai and discharged the remainder of the cargo.
After hauling cargo to Danang, Chu Lai, Camranh Bay, and Phan Rang, "Washoe County" joined with an amphibious ready group whose mission was to conduct an amphibious raid, Operation Jackstay against Viet Cong southeast of Saigon. She served in a pioneering role as an advance base providing gunfire support, arms, ammunition, rations, and water to assault boat groups.
"Washoe County" returned to Yokosuka on 28 May 1966 for a brief period of repairs and rehabilitation. On 18 June 1966, the ship sailed for Okinawa to reload supplies, then made a visit to Hong Kong before resuming her duties as a cargo carrier along the Vietnamese coast.
In mid-August, she steamed through the Inland Sea of Japan and Shimonoseki Strait on her way to Korea. After a week of training with the Republic of Korea Navy, "Washoe County" returned to Iwakuni, Japan, and embarked Marines and cargo. Before returning to Yokosuka at the end of October 1966, the ship made two more lifts to Vietnam, carrying cargo to Chu Lai and Qui Nhon and returning equipment from Danang to Naha, Okinawa.
The year 1967 began with Washoe County in the port of Naha, Okinawa, loading cargo. She spent the month of January engaged in shuttle runs carrying cargo and personnel along the South Vietnamese coast and Okinawa and then enjoyed a rest and recreation visit to Hong Kong. The ship spent most of February 1967 conducting intracoastal logistic support lifts along the South Vietnam coast. On 20 February 1967, "Washoe County" participated in Operation De Soto, in which material was offloaded by Marine helicopters operating off the ship's main deck. The operation was concluded on 8 March 1967, and the tank landing ship underwent an upkeep period lasting from 20 March 1967 to 11 April 1967.
From 15 April 1967 to 2 June 1967, "Washoe County" made shuttle runs with cargo and troops to Chi Lung, Taiwan; Danang and Chu Lai, South Vietnam; Naha, Okinawa; Yokosuka, Japan; and Inchon, South Korea. The ship then returned to Yokosuka for upkeep from 7 June 1967 to 22 June 1967, during which time "Washoe County" became the flagship for Landing Squadron 9.
The crew enjoyed liberty at Hong Kong from 11 July 1967 to 16 July 1967; then debarked the commodore and his staff at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, and took Army personnel to Pusan, Korea, before returning to Yokosuka on 3 August 1967 for upkeep which was completed on 7 September 1967. In mid-September, the ship arrived at Danang and participated in three major Operation Fortress Sentry, Operation Formation Leader, and Operation Badger Hunt, from 14 September 1967 to 2 December 1967.
"Washoe County" retired to Subic Bay on 5 December 1967 and soon sailed to Okinawa for training exercises with Marines. She returned to Yokosuka on 18 December 1967 for upkeep which lasted into 1968.
On 1 March 1968, "Washoe County" sailed for Danang, South Vietnam, in company with USS "Terrell County" (LST-1157) and USS "Westchester County" (LST-1167), carrying causeway sections to be used at Wunder Beach, South Vietnam. The sections were splashed and moved into place on 17 March 1968. While engaged in the causeway installation, "Washoe County"s port shaft was damaged; and she underwent repairs at Subic Bay from 21 March 1968 to 25 March 1968. She then returned to Vietnam, but further problems with the port shaft developed, necessitating more extensive repairs at Subic Bay which lasted until 29 April 1968. The ship then successfully completed sea trials and got underway for Japan and arrived at Yokosuka on 5 May 1968.
"Washoe County" underwent upkeep at Yokosuka which was not finished until early June 1968. On 3 June 1968, she began loading Marine equipment at Naha, and she delivered it at Subic Bay on 8 June 1968. Following a visit to Hong Kong from 14 June 1968 to 19 June 1968, she headed for South Vietnam. En route on 20 June 1968, "Washoe County" embarked two injured personnel from the American freighter SS "John C." after that ship had run aground on the north reef of the Paracel Islands.
The next day, "Washoe County" returned to Danang and resumed duties with the amphibious ready group. With the exception of upkeep from 10 July 1968 to 20 July 1968, the ship served in the combat zone continuously through July and much of August. On 24 August 1968, "Washoe County" headed for her home port and arrived at Yokosuka on 12 September 1968.
"Washoe County" began her last deployment of 1968 off the coast of South Vietnam at the Ca Mau Peninsula for Operation Market Time, sealing off the coastline of South Vietnam and adjacent waterways from communist infiltration. From 27 October 1968 to 9 December 1968, she functioned as an emergency helicopter landing pad in evacuating eight U.S. Navy and United States Coast Guard personnel wounded in action and the body of one Coast Guardsman who had been killed in action ashore. She also dispensed fuel, food, water, and ammunition to 134 patrol boats and fired 42 naval gunfire support missions.
"Washoe County" arrived back at Yokosuka on 19 December 1968 and spent the end of 1968 there.
"Washoe County" began 1969 preparing for the cyclical yard overhaul period which commenced on 19 January 1969 and continued through 10 April 1969. From 20 April 1969 to 6 June 1969, she conducted refresher training and amphibious refresher training. On 12 June 1969, "Washoe County" got underway for the first deployment of the year as a support ship for Operation Seafloat/Tran Hung Dao III in the Ca Mau Peninsula of South Vietnam. Seafloat was a floating advanced tactical support base primarily for psychological warfare missions conducted in the Cua Lon River at the southernmost tip of South Vietnam. During this period, "Washoe County" served as a helicopter platform and provided logistics and communications support.
On 10 August 1969, after 46 days on station, "Washoe County" sailed via Subic Bay to Hong Kong for a two-week assignment as station ship. She got underway on 4 September 1969 for Yokosuka but was diverted by a trip from Okinawa to Danang and finally arrived at her home port on 23 September 1969. She remained there until 9 October 1969 when she transported a detachment of Marines and equipment from Okinawa to Numazu, Japan.
Departing Japan on 28 October 1969, "Washoe County" participated in Operation Keystone Cardinal, a major troop redeployment lift from Vietnam. During November, "Washoe County" steamed more than 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 kilometers) bringing troops and equipment from Vietnam to Okinawa before returning to Yokosuka on 3 December 1969 for annual inspections and the Christmas holiday season.
"Washoe County" took station as a Seafloat support vessel from 20 January 1970 to 12 March 1970 and again from 17 May 1970 to 2 August 1970. Between these two deployments, "Washoe County" served as station ship in Hong Kong from 18 March 1970 to 27 March 1970.
On 12 August 1970, "Washoe County" arrived at Osaka, Japan, to enjoy four days at the World's Fair, Expo 70. From 19 August 1970 to 19 September 1970, she underwent upkeep at Yokosuka and then made a visit to Hong Kong.
After stopping at Chu Lai, Vietnam, and Subic Bay, the Philippines, to load cargo on board, "Washoe County" headed for the California coast, via Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Diego on 10 November 1970. She offloaded Marine cargo at Camp Pendleton on 13 November 1970, then made a port visit to San Francisco.
"Washoe County" earned a Presidential Unit Citation, a Navy Unit Commendation, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and twelve campaign stars for Vietnam War service. The campaign stars were for:
Decommissioning.
On 24 November 1970, "Washoe County" arrived at Bremerton, Washington, and, on 25 November 1970, her status changed to "in commission, in reserve." On 25 March 1971, the ship was decommissioned.
Military Sealift Command service.
"Washoe County" was reactivated in January 1973 to serve as a cargo ship in a non-commissioned status with a civil service crew with the Military Sealift Command in January 1973, being designated the United States Naval Ship USNS "Washoe County" (T-LST-1165). This service continued until she was stricken from the Navy List on 1 November 1973. At that time, she was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, Benicia, California.
Transfer to Peru.
On 7 August 1984, "Washoe County" and three of her sister ships -- USS "Traverse County" (LST-1160), USS "Waldo County" (LST-1163), and USS "Walworth County" (LST-1164)—were leased to Peru, and "Washoe County" was commissioned into service in the Peruvian Navy as BAP "Callao" (DT-143) on 4 March 1985. Peru renewed the lease on all four ships in August 1989 and August 1994, and the United States sold all four outright to Peru under the Security Assistance Program on 26 April 1999; all four were struck from the U.S. Naval Register on the day of the sale.
Notes.
A section of interstate 80 at the state line of California and Nevada/Washoe County celebrates the crew of the USS Washoe County, the sign is located beneath the "WELCOME TO NEVADA" sign.

Time Warp (TV series)

Time Warp was a popular science-themed television program produced for the Discovery Channel in the United States, in which Jeff Lieberman, an MIT scientist, teacher, and artist, along with high speed camera expert Matt Kearney, use their high speed camera to examine everyday occurrences and singular talents.
"Time Warp" captured common everyday events and viewed them again in slow motion to uncover the many principles of physics. To do so, they examined things such as a drop of water, explosions (many of them), gunshots, ballet dancing, cornflour, shallow water diving, X games and sometimes some uncanny things like piercing one's cheek or standing on blades.
The high speed cameras were used at as low as 500 frame/second for capturing how dogs drink to as high as 40,000 frame/second for capturing bullets, breaking glass, etc. Speeds above 20,000 frame/second were shot in black and white as the data for lightness and darkness is reduced when there is no color (hue) value to shoot. This is because the recording was digital and so the frame rate is limited to a certain data rate and black-and-white footage is much smaller (in memory space) than full color.
Home Media Release.
The entire Time Warp series is available on both DVD and Blu-ray sets, making it the first Discovery show to be fully released on Blu-ray. The truncated 3rd season was included in the Season 2 set (not noted on box). Bonus features include: deleted scenes (season 2 only), the pilot episode (Blu-ray season 1 only), and a recap of season 1. 
Note: Episodes 13 (Cheerleading) and 14 (Trail Bikes) from season 1, were flipped from broadcast order on the Blu-ray set. Season 2 Disc 2, the episode listing is out of sequence.

Larchill

Larchill, one of Ireland's most important gardens, is the most complete surviving Ferme ornée (ornamental farm-style garden) in Europe and the site of multiple follies. The main component of Larchill Demesne, it was created in the mid-18th century, and restored from the mid-1990s. It lies in the townland of Phepotstown near Kilcock, County Kildare, Ireland.
History.
The gardens were formed in the late 18th and early 19th century, by Mr. Robert and Mrs. Watson.
A family named de Las Casas bought Larchill in 1994. By then, many of the follies were semi-derelict, the lake had been drained and the walled garden was being used for grazing. They secured a grant for restoration from the Great Gardens of Ireland Programme and, helped by a FAS Community Employment Scheme, the restoration project was carried out between 1994 and 1999, winning a number of awards.
Features.
Layout.
The farm and garden form a rough rectangle, with scenic parkland walks, including beech avenues, linking key features. The walled garden and farmyard are situated at the north end, and a substantial lake at the south end.
Walled garden and farmyard.
Restored to a traditional 18th century formal design in the 1990s, the walled garden has multiple beds, including herb and vegetable sections, borders of perennial planting, box hedges, and water features. 
The most prominent feature of the walled garden is the Cockle Tower, a circular castellated construction on three-levels in the south west corner. Commenced in 1820, it has rough limestone rubble walls, and an entrance on the first level above ground, reached by steps. Both doorway and windows have pointed arches. The interior was decorated with shells, of which some remain. There is a local legend that Mrs. Watson was buried there, until later owners had her remains moved to a churchyard.
Also attached to the walls is an ornamental dairy, on the southern elevation. Begun around 1810, it has an arcade, with columns, arched openings and stained glass windows, and a shell fountain.
The Gothic-style farmyard, in the form of two courtyards to north of the main house, has dovecotes, stable ranges and pigsties. The buildings have slate roofs, limestone dressings, and timed-framed and diamond-paned windows.
Lake.
The ornamental lake has an area of around 32,000 m2 (8 acre), with two islands, each featuring a folly, and a statue of Bacchus between them. There is also an ornamental Gothic boathouse dug into the side of the lake, with a single-arch to the lake, and a wrought-iron gate to the rear. By the lake are water and flower meadows. Fauna include frogs, dragonflies, wild duck and swans.
There is a Chinese prayer lantern to the south of the lake, with a Chinoiserie bridge, in place of what used to be a bridge to the Temple Island.
Follies.
Mock naval battles were fought on the lake in past centuries.
Other features.
There is an 18th-century "sheep run," while at the north end of the western walk are a 19th-century Chinese prayer lamp and statue. There is also an eel pond, and an "eel house", a tower in which to catch eels. 
When the lake was dug in the 18th century, the soil from the excavation was used to form a "feuillé", a circular mound with a decorative spiral of beech trees on top. 
Farm animals.
Rare breeds of animal were used in the 18th and 19th century in such gardens, and today various breeds of cattle and sheep, along with llamas and emus, graze the parkland, while pigs, goats and fowl can be found in the farmyard.
Modern facilities.
There is parking for cars and coaches, a tea-room in a converted barn, a gift shop and a picnic area. The gardens open May to September, and an admission fee is charged. Archery lessons are also offered.

Harry Teague

Harry Teague (born June 29, 1949) is the former U.S. Representative for , serving from 2009 until 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. 
The district is located in the southern part of the state and includes Hobbs, Roswell, Carlsbad, Las Cruces and the southern fourth of Albuquerque.
Early life, education and career.
Teague grew up in an impoverished family of sharecroppers and lived the first nine years of his life in rural central Oklahoma without running water. His family moved to Hobbs, New Mexico when he was nine years old. He attended Hobbs High School but dropped out at the age of 17 to work in the oil fields to support his sick parents. He is married to Nancy Teague and has two children and five grandchildren. Teague is a small business owner of a company that now employs 250 people and is a member of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association.
Early political career.
Teague was elected as a Democrat to the Republican-controlled Lea County Board of Commissioners. He served on the Board for eight years, and was elected chairman by his fellow Board members for three and a half of those years.
U.S. House of Representatives.
Legislation.
Early in the 111th Congress, Teague introduced legislation that would modify the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by providing for the refundability of the child tax credit for five years and extending credit for electricity produced using certain renewable resources. This legislation has been referred to the House Ways and Means Committee.
Teague is a co-sponsor of the Southwest Border Violence Reduction Act of 2009, which would direct the United States Attorney General to expand resources for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives initiative to identify, investigate, and prosecute firearms trafficking across the U.S. border with Mexico. The bill has been referred to both the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
On January 28, 2009, the House agreed to an amendment, proposed by Teague, to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The amendment requires the Recovery.gov website to have links to job information at public agencies receiving funding under the bill and at private firms contracted to perform work under the bill. Later that day, the House voted, 244-188, to pass the Act.
Teague was one of 39 Democrats in the House to vote against the Affordable Healthcare for America Act and he also voted against the reconciled bill from the Senate language on March 21, 2010.
In June 2009, Teague voted for the American Clean Energy and Security Act. At a meeting that occurred following the vote, a group of Tea Party activists disrupted the meeting because they were upset that Teague was meeting with constituents on a one-on-one basis, and to express their frustration with the vote. A 2009 Pew Environment Group poll had found that 69% of voters in New Mexico's 2nd district would support an energy bill that mandated electric utilities to generate 20% of their electricity from renewable sources and reduce carbon emissions.
Political campaigns.
2008.
In 2008, Republican incumbent Steve Pearce of the 2nd congressional district declined to run for re-election, instead unsuccessfully seeking the U.S. Senate seat left open by the retirement of Pete Domenici. Teague ran for the Democratic nomination against Bill McCamley, winning with 52 percent of the primary vote. The winner of the five-way Republican primary was Edward R. Tinsley, a Capitan rancher and the owner of the K-Bob's Steakhouse restaurant chain. 
Although the 2nd has historically been the most conservative district in New Mexico, polls showed the race to be very competitive. Ultimately, Teague won in the general election with 56 percent of the vote to Tinsley's 44 percent. He received strong support from the western side of the district, as well as from its large Latino population. Teague and the Democratic Party outspent Tinsley and the Republican Party by over $3 million in the 2008 campaign. 
His victory returned the 2nd to the Democrats for the first time in 28 years.
2010.
November 2, 2010, Teague lost the midterm election to former Republican congressman and business owner Steve Pearce, with Teague receiving 45% of the vote, and Pearce receiving 55%.

Historic 25th Street

Historic 25th Street is a historic district located in Ogden, Utah, United States.
The Historic 25th Street neighborhood occupies three blocks of 25th Street, beginning at Wall Avenue on the west end and ending at Washington Ave on the east, with Lincoln and Grant Avenues transecting.
History.
The history of 25th Street began with the opening of Union Station, at the west end of the street, during the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Later, another rail line, the Utah Northern Railroad, was built between Franklin, Idaho and Ogden. The Ogden Union Station Depot became the hub for the Utah Northern Railroad, and served as a major railroad junction. The original structure of the Union Station Depot was destroyed by a fire in 1923. 
During the early 20th century, 25th Street was a center of activity in Ogden. Home to retail shops, restaurants, ice cream parlors, hotels, and laundries, the street was also a common site for illicit activities such as gambling, prostitution and narcotic sales. Popularly known as ‘’Two-Bit Street’’, the area obtained such a seedy reputation that Al Capone is rumored to have said that Ogden was too wild a town for him. An urban legend tells of a system of underground tunnels that bootleggers created during prohibition to move alcohol from Union Station to the Bigelow-Ben Lomond Hotel located on the east end of the neighborhood.
In 1954, 25th Street was cleaned up as part of a city-wide crime-reduction effort led by Mayor Lorin Farr (a descendant of Ogden's first mayor, Lorin Farr).
Historic 25th Street today.
Today, Historic 25th Street features restaurants, art galleries, retail shops, and hosts outdoor community events such as a farmers' market (July through September) and car shows. The rebuilt Union Station houses the Utah State Railroad Museums, the John M. Browning Arms Museum, and the Browning-Kimball Classic Car Museum. The street is also the location for the Ogden City Municipal Building and the Federal Courthouse.

<doc id="20090557" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20090557" title="Premios Oye!">
Premios Oye!

Premios Oye! (Premio Nacional a la Música Grabada) are presented annually by the "Academia Nacional de la Música en México" for outstanding achievements in the Mexican record industry. The awards ceremony features performances by important national and international artists like Robbie Williams, Sarah Brightman, Shakira, Juanes, Paul McCartney and Lily Allen among others.
The awards were established in 2002 by the ANAMUSA (Academia Nacional de la Música) in order to reward composers, artists, record companies and every person who is involved in the music industry. This recognizes the very best of musical production without counting the position where the artists charted in the Mexican Albums Chart. 
The equivalent of Premios Oye! (Spanish, meaning "Hear! Awards") to the United States's Grammy Awards. It is telecast by Televisa in Mexico through its Canal de las Estrellas and on Univision in the USA.
Muse trophy.
The trophy was created by the recognized Mexican plastic artist Jorge Marín, who previewed the award as a silhouette of a woman. In his own words, he acknowledges that the female body is a perfect body which represents the triumph of its gender and reflects the victory of each winner. 
The Muse consists of an alloy with bronze and polished silver, creating a unique contrast that enhances the aesthetic appeal of the trophy. The trophy consists of a woman standing on the world, in her right hand holding the world of music and on the left, a lyre, which is the symbol of ANAMUSA. Bearing a naked torso and a rising sun on its head, this statue is a collector's item.
Categories.
The awards are divided into 3 groups: Pop and Rock, Anglo and Popular which includes physical and digital sales. El Consejo de la Comunicación gives an award called "Premio Social a la Música" to the song or artist that promotes positive values. Also the Academy dedicated a special tribute to the trajectory of Timbiriche, Marco Antonio Solís, Los Tigres del Norte and Miguel Bosé that was first awarded in 2008.
The 20 categories as 2008 are:
It is expected that Electronica and Indie categories will be included soon due to success in recent years.
Nomination Process.
ANAMUSA and record companies are responsible for entering into nomination the works that they deem most deserving. Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held by experts selected from the academy. This is done only to determine whether or not a work is eligible or entered into the proper category for official nomination. 
Some of the rules of nomination process are: Live Records and Best Of are eligible for nominations if they contain at least 2 new records and only participate in "Song of the Year" according to its category (pop & rock, Anglo or popular). Any artist can be nominated in Breakthrough Artist of the Year (Artista Revelación del Año) national and international artists who have achieved significant success in Mexico for the first time with records released in the eligibility period.
As of 2008, the eligibility period for the Premios Oye! begins July 1 from the previous year to June 30 of the actual year. PricewaterhouseCoopers is in charge of accounting the results of votes from more than 1,700 members of the jury in order to obtain 5 nominees or 6 in case of a tie. It is also responsible for publicizing the winners through sealed envelopes that will be open on the day of the final.
Winners.
155 Musas of Premio Oye! have been awarded to 95 artists in 9 years. To date Shakira and Alejandro Fernández has won the most awards, 9 and 8 respectively.
"List of winners Premios Oye! Year by Year"
Incidents.
Ban Controversy and Yahir's 'Breakthrough of the Year' win (2003).
Since Televisa is responsible for the show, that year Nadia and Yahir were nominated for Breakthrough artists in Popular and Spanish respectively and since the artists were alumni from TV Azteca's project La Academia, some media expected the banning of the moments from Televisa since they were promoting their competitor. However there was no banning from the first winner, Nadia who was congratulated by the host, Adal Ramones. But the controversy came when Yahir won Breakthrough of the Year because he thanked TV Azteca in a live show transmitted in Televisa Network.
Angélica Rivera.
Some prominent media figures disagreed with the presentation of an award to Angélica Rivera because they said she was an actress, not a singer and the other nominees had more seniority in the music field. They contended that the award was given to her primarily because the show was on Televisa and her telenovela was very successful at the time. However she has a musical background since 90's when she sang in Muñecos de Papel alongside Ricky Martin and Sasha Sokol

He is best known for his illustrations of children's books and fantasy literature. "His work...has a lively, imaginative charm and a distinctive sense of design."
A native of Dumfriesshire, Millar first pursued civil engineering before deciding upon an artistic career. He then studied at the Wolverhampton Art School and the Birmingham School of Art, and established his career as a magazine illustrator with "Punch", "Good Words", and other periodicals of the day.
Millar illustrated fables for the Strand Magazine, and anthologies of tales, "The Golden Fairy Book", "The Silver Fairy Book", "The Diamond Fairy Book", and "The Ruby Fairy Book". He illustrated books by a wide range of British authors of his time, including Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Rudyard Kipling. He had an extensive working relationship with E. Nesbit, and has been called "the most sympathetic and perhaps the most talented of her illustrators."
Apart from fantasy and children's books, Millar drew pictures for works like Kate Lawson's "Highways and Homes of Japan" (1910) and Arthur Radclyffe Dugmore's "African Jungle Life" (1928). Millar was a noted collector of Eastern art and exotic and ancient weapons, and employed his interest and knowledge in these areas in his artwork.

Rover Light Six

The Rover Light Six was a mid-size formal saloon produced from 1927 through to 1932 by the Rover Company of Coventry.
Overview.
The Rover Light Six was one of the first Rover cars manufactured under the aegis of Spencer and Maurice Wilks who introduced new management practices and engineering techniques to Rover.
It was powered by a watercooled 2 L straight-6 OHV engine with an output of 45 bhp at 3600 rpm designed by Peter Poppe, which allowed a maximum speed of 60 mph (97 km/h). The bore of 65 mm put the engine into the 16 hp taxation class. The suspension was conventional for the time with half elliptic leaf springs all round. It was available with a two-door "Sportsman's Saloon" bodywork by Weymann, a regular coachbuilder for Rover cars at that time. The 'Standard' version came at a price of 325 Pound Sterling, while the luxurious 'Regal' edition cost 355 Pound Sterling. A four-door version became available during the last two years of production for 335 Pound Sterling, also supplied by Weymann.
The Rover Light Six gained a worldwide reputation when it was the first successful participant in the Blue Train Races, a series of record-breaking attempts between automobiles and trains in the late 1920s and early 1930s. It saw a number of motorists and their own or sponsored automobiles race against the "Le Train Bleu", a train that ran between Calais and the French Riviera.
Blue Train Race.
In January 1930, the Rover name hit the world press when a Rover tried to take on "Le train bleu" on its 750 mile run between Calais and Cannes. The idea of racing the Blue Train was very popular with motor enthusiasts, and each new attempt was received with varying expectations of success. Many had already failed on this mammoth challenge. The act to promote the new Rover Light Six in a headline-grabbing campaign was the brainchild of former motorcycle tester and pioneer publicist Dudley Noble, in which a Light Six was to race the Blue Train across France from Calais to St Raphael on the Côte d'Azur. It was a moderately shameless stunt of him, being safe in the knowledge that the average speed of the famous express was no more than about 40 mph once all its stops and detours were taken into account. To beat the train, Noble had to drive more or less non-stop from Calais to the French Riviera. The Rover Light Six averaged 38 mph on its 750 miles journey to beat the train's expected time of just over 20 hours, which gave the Rover team a 20 minute lead over the train. It had been beaten for the first time and the Rover team became celebrities through the ""Daily Express"".
In March 1930, Bentley Boy Woolf Barnato raised the stakes on Rover by bettering the record with his 6½ Litre Bentley Speed Six on a bet of 100 Pound Sterling. He drove against the train from Cannes to Calais, then by ferry to Dover and finally London, travelling on public highways, and won; the H. J. Mulliner-bodied formal saloon he drove during the race as well as a streamlined fastback "Sportsman Coupé" by Gurney Nutting he took delivery of on 21 May 1930 became known as the "Blue Train Bentleys"; the latter is regularly mistaken for or errouneously referred to as being the car that raced the Blue Train, while in fact Barnato named it in memory of his race.

Charles Louis François de Paule de Barentin was a French statesman and Keeper of the Seals of France at the end of the reign of Louis XVI. He was born in Paris on 1 July 1738 and died in Paris on 30 May 1819.
Born into a well-known noble judicial family, de Barentin was Advocate General of the Parlement of Paris (1757 to 1775), president of the Cour des Aides (1775 to 1788) and became Keeper of the Seals on 14 September 1788, which post he held until 15 July 1789. Four days earlier, on the advice of his privy council, the king had dismissed his populist Director-General of Finances, Jacques Necker. The public outcry led to the storming of the Bastille three days later, and Louis was forced to recall Necker. The king held de Barentin responsible and sacked him.
In November of the same year he was accused by a revolutionary court of conspiring to order troops to fire on the crowd storming the Bastille, but was acquitted, and emigrated to Italy and then England, where he remained until the restoration of the monarchy. He was made honorary chancellor by Louis XVIII.

Super Lap

Super Lap is a time attack motorsport event. Super Lap events are being held in Australia and New Zealand.
The inaugural Superlap Australia Superlap Australia event was held at the Oran Park Raceway in July 2008. It has since become an annual event attracting the fastest circuit cars in the country and even some overseas guests.
In New Zealand, the first NZ Performance Car Super Lap was held in April 2007 at Taupo Motorsport Park. It was the first event of its kind held in New Zealand on a race circuit. Other time trial-style events have been road-based run by motoring clubs, such as rallying and bent sprints.
Super Lap is an event specially formulated as a total test of import street car performance, and is only open to JDM (Japanese domestic market) import cars. Originating in Japan—where such events are often called "Tuner Battles" because of competition between "tuning houses"—the style of racing has been adopted in the UK, US, and Australia.
In Australia, Super Lap is divided into three classes: Club Sprint Class, Open Class and an invitational Pro Class
The requirements for each class are described on the Superlap Australia website.
In its New Zealand format, Super Lap is broken down into individual classes: Street Pro (PRO), Street Private (PVT) and Unlimited class (ULM).
Street Pro consists of caged warranted, registered and certified cars. Street Private consists of uncaged, street-legal cars. The Unlimited class (introduced for Super Lap 2008 at Taupo Motorsport Park) allows full competition cars—those not road-registered but race-ready—to compete. Unlimited class cars are not eligible to win Super Lap.
Competitors are timed over a single flying lap of the track in a qualifying format. Competitors start from the pit lane on its out-lap. When the car crosses the start-finish line for the first time, the timer is started. The timer is stopped when the start-finish line is crossed at the end of the flying lap, and the competitor performs and in-lap, returning to the pits. The fastest ten go into a top-10 shootout in the same format. The winner of this wins the event.
Typical cars.

Edward the King (play)

Edward The King is a two act play by American playwright David Brendan Hopes. The play is an adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's play Edward II, which in turn is a dramatization of the real life story of Edward II of England.
Overview.
Beset by the duties of his birth and dominated by a heroic father, Edward looks forward to a life of apparent conformity and desperate subterfuge, until he meets Piers Gaveston in a dirty alley. It is love and rebellion at first sight. From then on, Edward steers a perilous course between desire and safety, which does not entirely end even when he becomes king, and faces not only the usual enemies of unconventional love, but his queen and her lover as well. Edward the King neatly straddles the 14th and 21st centuries, which manage to appear almost equally violent and inhospitable to love.

Murali Vijay

Murali Vijay Krishna (born 1 April 1984) is an Indian cricketer. He is a right-handed opening batsman for Tamil Nadu and Chennai Super Kings.
Early and personal life.
He studied at Gill Adarsh Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Chennai, and post graduation at SRM University, Chennai. Vijay completed his UG and PG in economics in RKM Vivekananda college, Chennai. 
Test career.
Vijay made his Test debut against Australia in the Fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, in Nagpur, in November 2008. He was selected for the match after Gautam Gambhir received a one-Test ban for elbowing Shane Watson in the Third Test of the same series in Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi. Vijay was participating in a Ranji trophy match at the time, and made his Test debut on the final day of that match. 
Of Vijay's technique, former Australian captain Allan Border said "His defensive shots are so assured. And he looks comfortable of both front and back foot. And when he attacks, he doesn't go hard at the deliveries. I can see why this young man is playing".
Vijay partnered Virender Sehwag, and they got India off to a solid start in both innings. Vijay made 33 and 41, contributing to opening stands of 98 and 116. During Australia's first innings, Vijay caused the first wicket to fall, running out Matthew Hayden with a direct hit from mid on. Hayden was attempting a quick single. He then ran out Michael Hussey when fielding at silly point. Hussey was unaware that Vijay had intercepted the ball at close range and instinctively took a step out of his crease in anticipation of a run, by which time Vijay threw down the stumps. In the second innings, he caught Brett Lee at bat pad from the bowling of Harbhajan Singh to complete his first catch.
Following his performance in his debut Test, Vijay was selected for the Indian ODI squad for the first three matches against the touring England team. He did not get to play, and was dropped after the first three matches upon the return of senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar from a break.
In December 2009, Vijay was given another opportunity in the Test team when Gambhir withdrew from the Third and final Test against Sri Lanka at Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai in order to attend his sister's wedding. Vijay took two catches at bat pad from Harbhajan in Sri Lanka's first innings. When India replied, he put on 221 for the first wicket with Sehwag, but was out for 87 in sight of his maiden Test century. The Indians went on to complete an innings victory, and become the number 1 Test team.
Vijay was taken on the tour of Bangladesh in January 2010 as the reserve batsman, and he was called into the team after V. V. S. Laxman injured a finger in the First Test. Vijay played in the Second Test in Mirpur in Laxman's No. 5 position, scoring 30. In the same match, No. 3 batsman Rahul Dravid was injured after being hit under the jaw by a bouncer, so Vijay then played in Dravid's position in the two-Test home series against South Africa.
He was later selected as the reserve opener for away series against Sri Lanka in August 2010 and the home series against Australia in October 2010. He played in the Second and Third Tests against Sri Lanka after Gambhir was injured. He got another opportunity when Gambhir, was injured in the first match against Australia and was ruled out of Second Test. Vijay scored 139 runs in the first innings, his maiden Test century, featuring in a triple century partnership with Sachin Tendulkar. Vijay and debutant Cheteshwar Pujara added 72 runs crucial partnership which helped India complete a 2–0 series win.
Though he was dropped from the national squad, however he was brought back in the 2013 home series against Australia replacing out-of-form Gautam Gambhir. Though Vijay failed in the 1st test, he scored an assured and well paced 167 in the 2nd test and put on a 370-run record 2nd wicket partnership with Cheteshwar Pujara (204). In the 3rd test at Mohali, he scored his second consecutive 150+ score (153) with a strong opening stand of 289 with debutant Shikhar Dhawan, who scored a whopping 187 off just 174 balls. And then added on 92 runs on the 3rd wicket with Sachin Tendulkar (37). He had an amazing series against Australia and was the highest scorer with 430 runs including two centuries both which were 150+ and an amazing half century. Murali Vijay has three test centuries to his name, all three against Australia.
ODI career.
Vijay debuted in ODIs against South Africa in the third and final one dayer on 27 Feb 2010. He scored a brisk 25 runs off 16 balls.
He started a full series during a tri-nations tournament in Zimbabwe when India rested most of the first-choice team. Vijay performed poorly and was dropped for India's fourth match as they came last behind Zimbabwe.
Vijay was selected for New Zealand 5 ODI series 2010 and he played first 3 ODI in which he scored an average of 30. Later, he was replaced by wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel for other 2 ODI matches.
Vijay has the most number of centuries by any cricketer from Tamil Nadu. Srikkanth and Sadagoppan Ramesh had 2 each
International T20 career.
Vijay was selected for 2010 ICC World Twenty20. He fared poorly in India's disastrous campaign averaging just below 15 and failing to provide good starts in all the matches.
IPL career.
Murali plays for IPL franchise from his home town Chennai Super Kings. He was one of the key performers for Chennai in the 3rd edition of IPL in 2010 when Chennai were crowned champions. His first century for Chennai Super Kings was in the third season of the IPL where he scored 127 runs of 56 balls against the Rajasthan Royals. He was awarded the Man of the Match. In the same year, Vijay had prolific run in the Champions League T20 held in South Africa. Vijay was the top scorer of the tournament with 294 runs. He was instrumental in Chennai winning the cup.

In the beginning of IPL 2012, Vijay struggled to return to form. His first few matches was a disaster for Chennai, as he was out of form yet he was the opening batsmen for Chennai Super Kings. But he had his luck returned to him when he scored 113 of just 59 balls. With the century he became the only Indian cricketer to have scored two centuries in the history of DLF IPL.

Siberian River Routes

Siberian River Routes were the main ways of communication in the Russian Siberia before the 1730s, when roads began to be built. The rivers also were of primary importance in the process of Russian exploration and colonization of vast Siberian territories. Since the three great
Siberian rivers, Ob River, Yenisei River and Lena River all flow into the Arctic Ocean, the problem was to find parts or branches of these rivers that flow approximately east-west and find short portages between them. Since Siberia is relatively flat, portages were usually short. Because of this, and the weakness of the Siberian tribes, Russian Cossacks were able to expand from the Urals to the Pacific in only 57 years (1582-1639).
Southern Route.
Distances are straight lines and only approximate. Siberian rivers can be very crooked. Dates usually refer to the foundation of the first Russian settlement.
Over the Urals: From the Volga River, up the Kama to Perm (1472), then up the Chusovaya River. The Urals here are only about 350 meters high, about 150 meters above the surrounding lowlands. Down either the Tavda River or Tura River and a short way up the Tobol River to its juncture with the Irtysh River at Tobolsk (1582). Tobolsk is about 700 km east of Perm and 1800 km east of Moscow. In 1598 Verkhoturye was founded in the Urals as the gateway to Siberia. This was the approximate route used by Yermak. The Siberian Route, a road begun in the 1730s, ran southeast from Perm to Kungur, then over another low pass to Yekaterinburg (1723) and Tobolsk. By 1885 there was a railway from Perm to Yekaterinburg. Another branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway (1891) goes south of the Urals through Chelyabinsk (1736), Omsk (1716) and Novosibirsk (1893).
Ob Basin: Near Tobolsk was the capital of the Khanate of Sibir, which was conquered in 1582. North down the Irtysh to its juncture with the Ob River, then 750km up the Ob to Narym (1594), and up the Ket River (1602) about 300 km to its headwaters.
Here a portage leads to the Yenisei River at Yeniseysk (1619). Yeniseysk is about 1400 km from Tobolsk and 3200 km from Moscow.
An alternative route led from the Irtysh-Ob juncture 450 km up the Ob to the Vakh, 500 km up the Vakh, then portage to the Sym, down it to the Yenesei, upstream to Yenisesk.
Yenisey and Lena Basins: Yeniseysk is on the Yenisei River just north of its juncture with the Angara River. From Yeniseysk east up the Angara to the Ilim River, upstream to Ilimsk (1630), portage to Kuta River, short trip downstream to Ust-Kut (1631) on the Lena River. From here northeast down the Lena about 1400 km to Yakutsk, which is 4900 km east of Moscow. Yakutsk is a major stopping point and administrative center. Then 125 km up the Lena to the Aldan, up the Aldan River to Ust-Maya, then up the Maya River or its right branch, the Yudoma River.
Okhotsk: From either of the last two, it is about 150 km over 2000 ft mountains to the Pacific (Okhotsk Coast 1639, Okhotsk town, 1647). Pack horses were used here. Okhotsk is 800 km east southeast of Yakutsk and 5,600 km east of Moscow. After 1715 there were shipbuilding facilities at Okhotsk, allowing sea travel to the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Kuril Islands, the Aleutian Islands and Alaska.
To the Amur: 
From 1643 to 1689 the Russians attempted to penetrate from the Lena south to the Amur region but were driven back by the Manchus. See Russian-Manchu border conflicts. From 1689 to 1859 the Russo-Chinese border was the Argun River and the Stanovoy Mountains. In 1859 Russia annexed the Amur region. From the west, the Russians penetrated to Ulan-Ude (1666), Chita (1653) and Nerchinsk (1654) toward the Argun. From 1727 much Russo-Chinese trade shifted to Kyakhta near where the Selenge River crosses the current Russo-Mongol border.
Northern Route.
From at least the 12th century, Russian Pomors navigated the White and Barents Seas. At some date, they entered the Ob Gulf or portaged across the Yamal Peninsula. From the Gulf of Ob to the Taz Estuary, up the Taz River, past Mangazeya (1601), portage to Yanov Stan on the Turukhan River, leading to Turukhansk (1607) on the Yenisei at its juncture with the Lower Tunguska. East up the Lower Tunguska. Where it turns south, portage to the Chona River, a tributary of the Vilyuy River - the junction of these two rivers has now been flooded, forming the Viluyskoe Reservoir. East along the Vilyuy to the Lena River, and then up the Lena to Yakutsk. It was also possible to continue up the Lower Tunguska to near Kirensk (1630) (175 km northeast of Ust-Kut), make a short portage to the Lena, and down the Lena to Yakutsk. Yakutsk is about 2400 km from the Taz Estuary. After about 1700 most trade shifted south and the route west of Turukhansk was largely abandoned.
Northeast.
From the mouth of the Lena River, along the coast to the mouth of the Kolyma River, up to Bolshoy Anyuy River, portage, down the Anadyr River to Anadyrsk (1650). One could continue down the Anadyr to the Pacific, but the area was too barren to be of interest. The area northeast of this route was avoided because of the warlike Chukchis. About 1700 Russians entered the Kamchatka Peninsula from Anadyrsk and later sailed there from Okhotsk. It is 1800 km from Yakutsk to the Bering Strait.
Southwest.
After the conquest of Astrakhan in 1566, Russia expanded southeast around the southern base of the Urals. This involved increasing political control over the Nogai Horde, the Kalmyks and the northern Kazakhs, followed by varying degrees of peasant colonization. Another route was up the Irtysh toward the Altai country (Semipalitinsk, 1718).
Decline of the River Route.
The southern border of Siberia corresponds to the forest-steppe boundary. Russian penetration of Asia was confined to the forest zone because the cossacks had the skills to travel through river and forest, because the native peoples were few and weak and because their expansion was paid for by the fur trade. Unlike Russia proper, there was little attempt to penetrate the steppe. Road building began in the 1730s. Although there were always some peasants, massive peasant colonization did not begin until the 1860s. The Trans-Siberian Railway began in 1891. In the twentieth century highways were built, but the stretch north of the Amur is still not complete. It goes without saying that all of this development took place as far south as possible. The result is a pattern in which the Russians form a long narrow belt along the southern border with some extensions northward, mainly to where minerals can be found. The rivers are still used, but largely for north-south transport to and from the Trans-Siberian Railway.

John Legg

John Legg is a Republican member of the Florida Senate, representing the 17th District, which includes parts of Hillsborough and Pasco Counties since 2012.
History.
Legg was born in Brooksville and lives in Port Richey, with his wife, Suzanne, and his five children, Rebecca, Dylan, Alexa, Jack, and Evangeline. He attended Pasco–Hernando Community College and the University of South Florida, where he graduated with a degree in social work in 1995. Legg worked as an educator, helping to establish the Dayspring Academy, a Pasco County charter school, in 2000.
Florida House of Representatives.
In 2002, Legg ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 45th District, though he lost to Tom Anderson in the Republican primary. Afterwards, he worked for State Representative Heather Fiorentino of the 46th district, as her staff director and as a consultant for the Republican Party of Florida. Following Fiorentino's retirement in 2004, Legg ran to succeed her, defeating John Stewart to win his party's nomination. In the general election, he faced Democratic nominee Delores Thomas and campaigned on a platform of opposing gun control and supporting affordable health insurance and smaller class sizes. He defeated Thomas easily, winning 56% of the vote. Legg was re-elected without opposition in 2006, and in 2008, faced Democratic nominee Ron Rice and independent candidate John J. Ubele. In this election, he received the endorsement of the "Tampa Bay Times", which praised him as an advocate for "helping shape state education policy," and easily defeated Rice and Ubele. He was elected to his final term in the House in 2010 with no opposition. During his final term, he served as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the Florida House of Representatives.
Senate.
Facing term limits in 2012, Legg resolved to run for the Florida State Senate in the 17th District, initially challenging incumbent State Senator Jim Norman in the primary. However, Norman ultimately decided against seeking another term, and Legg instead faced former State Representative Rob Wallace and security consultant John Korsak in the Republican primary. Though the "Tampa Bay Times" criticized him for the fact that he pushed "controversial bills that ended tenure for newly hired teachers and tied performance evaluations to standardized test results," they endorsed him once again, specifically citing his advocacy "for using end-of-year tests to supplant the FCAT as a measure of high school student achievement." Legg defeated Wallace and Korsak by a fairly wide margin and was unopposed in the general election.
After winning his seat in the Senate, he was immediately selected by Senate President Don Gaetz (R-Niceville) to serve as the chairman for the newly created Senate Education Committee; combining the formerly separate K-12, Higher Education and Workforce into one cohesive committee. He immediately took charge by sponsoring Senate Bill 1076, which was landmark legislation known as the Career and Professional Education Act (CAPE) of 2013, expanding the current CAPE program. "It enables middle and high school students to work towards industry certification while earning a high school diploma with the credits needed to enroll in college."
Senator Legg then emerged as a leader on an issue important to many Floridians: nuclear cost recovery for energy companies. He sponsored Senate Bill 1472 (Nuclear and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plants). "The bill increases the number of regulatory hoops a company has to jump through in order to pass PSC scrutiny and get rate hikes approved, and gives the PSC new authority to halt collection of the approved utility fees if construction is not advancing after 10 years, and again after 20 years." He also worked to pass legislation that would toughen restrictions on charter schools by "down on nepotism in school management, [forbidding large expenditures after a school declares its intentions to shut down and uniform monthly accountings to be posted on a school's website."

Nicholas Scibetta

Nicholas Scibetta, also known as "Little Nicky" (died 1978), was a Sicilian American mobster who was the nephew of Joseph Zicarelli and John Zicarelli and is the brother-in-law of Sammy Gravano and uncle of mafioso Gerard Gravano who was a Gambino crime family mob associate who was later marked as a stool pigeon by fellow crime family members.
Biography.
Nicholas Scibetta was born and raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, like his future brother-in-law Sammy Gravano. He was the only son born to first generation emigrants, a Mr. Scibetta from Cammarata in the province of Agrigento, Sicily and an Italian-American woman Mrs. Zicarelli from Bayonne, New Jersey. Mr. Scibetta and Mrs. Zicarelli had had two daughters, Debra and Diane, before she gave birth to Nicholas. His mother was a housewife and their father was a "a terrific father, but very strict" man who was a certified electrical engineer who worked the night shift for Western Electric (now AT&T Technologies) putting together circuit boards for the telephone company. While it is said that Mr. Scibetta was a strict authoritarian, it is never mentioned in any way that he physically abused his children by the observations made by Gravano.
Sammy later said about the unidentified Mr. Scibetta, "a beautiful guy, a mild-mannered guy, totally legitimate, one of the nicest guys I ever met in my life. His whole thing was looking after his baby daughter (Debra), which is completely understandable to me. I didn't have a problem with that." He only let Sammy court their daughter and keep Debra out late if her sister Diane would go with them. When Sammy Gravano started dating Debra from a young age, his parents knew that Nicholas was a "crazy kid" who was always getting into trouble. This suggests that he suffered from psychiatric problems that at the time were never diagnosed, possibly attention deficit disorder. He was a maternal nephew of Joseph Zicarelli, a notorious capo in the New Jersey satellite faction of the Bonanno crime family. It is unknown if he is a distant relative of Buffalo crime family capo Santo Scibetta, who controlled Hamilton, Ontario. He was a close acquaintance of Gambino crime family mob associates Liborio (Louie) Milito and Joseph (Stymie) D'Angelo Sr. who would both eventually be involved in his murder. It is also suggested that while raised a Catholic along with his sister he was not a devout believer in the Roman Catholic faith and spoke of interests joining a cult or a "group" of dissidents, somewhere outside the state.
Nick's Family Relationship with Sammy.
Among his other criminal endeavours, Zicarelli controlled a vast gambling empire operating from Hudson County, New Jersey. Around the time Sammy met Nick's sister, his uncle Zicarelli was sentenced to twelve to fifteen years for paying off politicians, allegedly including a U.S. congressman and a local prosecutor. Sammy later said, "He was a good kid, nice as you could want, growing up." But then he started doing cocaine and drinking heavily. He was arrested numerous times for driving while intoxicated with cocaine and alcohol. In Sammy Gravano's autobiography Underboss: Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia by Peter Maas, there are no photographs of Nicholas, but there are photos of his other brother-in-law Gambino crime family capos Edward Garofala, Garofala's cousin Edward Garofalo who is the nephew of Emmanuele Garofalo and a distant relative of mob associate Keith Gordon. Although he was raised properly by his parents and the nephew of Joseph Zicarelli, it was obvious by Sammy Gravano and fellow criminal associates in the Gambino crime family and Bonanno crime family that he did not have any real potential as a successful career criminal in organized crime.
When he (Sammy) told Debra's parents that he wanted to marry her there were protest from the mother and father. They would tell him, "She's too young, she's only seventeen. At first they're totally against it. Then they try to postpone it. Finally, they say we should at least wait until she's eighteen, which was in May (of that year)." Sammy agreed. The parents told Sammy and Debra to book a hall for the wedding. They thought that Sammy and Debra wouldn't be able to book a place less than a year in advance, and given enough time, the two would break up.
Criminal Life.
Nicholas's life was financially unstable, along with Sammy Gravano's. Sammy Gravano later said, "For one week he (himself) would be flush with cash, but two weeks later he would be broke. He never saved any money. He shopped for clothes, picked up tabs at restaurants and night clubs, handed out huge tips and dined on champagne and filet mignon at the Copacabana. Sammy later said of himself, Nick and his young aspiring mob associates, "Fucking kids, all dressed up like jerk-offs, running around, doing a little gambling, doing a little this and that and then broke again and it's macaroni and ricotta at home or spaghetti, past e olio, with the oil and garlic." Due to prior situations that arose in the past while Scibetta was alive, and current accusations that arose in court in 2003, it is suggested that Nicholas was a closeted homosexual. During his short life he was never known to have been with female companionship or had been engaged or married.
Sammy Gravano did not involve Nicholas in his own personal criminal activities but it is suggested that Nick was making a living as an independent criminal with associates of the Gambino crime family.
Falling out with the Gambino crime family.
Nicholas was the source of much anxiety, grief and stress of Gravano from the time he married his sister, to the time of his murder in 1978. One day, Liborio Milito phoned Sammy to report that somehow Nicholas had ended up in a gay nightclub owned by Gambino crime family capo John Rizzo. A major brawl had erupted. The police had been called to the scene. Sammy later stated, "I got down there right away and got him out of the joint before the cops started pulling people in." 
Another incident involved the son of Tony Jets, a Gambino crime family mob associate. Nick and the son had gotten into a fight and the son had beaten him up. Nick went to the police and the son was arrested for assault. Following this arrest, Sammy said that following this incident, "he was being marked as a rat (stool pigeon)." 
In another incident, Nick had apparently insulted the daughter of George DeCicco, the uncle of Frank DeCicco. Sammy Gravano later said,
"Now Frank (Frank DeCicco) did not get into this, but the girl's father went bananas. He goes to Toddo (Salvatore Aurello). He wants Nick roughed up. I step in and say I'll take care of it, let me handle it. I talked to Nick and slapped him in the face pretty hard. But it was better than getting his arms and legs broken. There are other situations with the kid. I'm trying to figure out what to do. Maybe get him the hell out of Bensonhurst. But unbeknownst to me, Paul Castellano is hearing about all of this. It's being put on record with Paul, the incidents with the recreational drug use and alcoholism, the thing with Tony Jets's son, George DeCicco's daughter and many other incidents. Paul Castellano told Frank DeCicco to get Sammy Gravano's crew to murder Nick. Frank gave the murder contract to mob associates Liborio (Louie) Milito and Joseph (Stymie) D'Angelo Sr. They felt sorry for Gravano and told him of the murder contract that had been handed down. Frank DeCicco discussed the planned murder with Castellano and convinced Paul to let Gravano know of his murder that was to be carried out. Sammy would later say, 
Torn between family relations and the Mob.
Sammy Gravano later said, 
Nick's gangland slaying and cover up.
Sammy Gravano stated, 
The police discovered one of his hands somewhere. There was a memorial held for him but his body was never found". He was declared legally dead in 1985. It is unknown exactly how or where his body was disposed of.
Alleged homosexual relations.
In 2003, during the damaging testimony of former Gambino crime family capo Michael DiLeonardo, supporters of John Gotti filed allegations to New York City newspapers that Sammy Gravano was involved in homosexual relationships with several young men, at least one of which was alleged to have been Nicholas. The accusations are unsubstantiated and have not been proven to the public.
In popular culture.
In the made for television HBO movie "Gotti", Scibetta is portrayed as "Nicky Scibetta" by actor Frank Crudele. In the film "Witness to the Mob", Nicky is portrayed by actor Kirk Acevedo. He is allegedly a real life inspiration for HBO prison drama series Oz characters father and son, Nino Schibetta and Peter Schibetta.
Discrepancies in film.
In the television movie "Gotti", Sammy Gravano, portrayed by William Forsythe, murders Nicholas by himself in a construction supply warehouse, while in his autobiography Underboss he states that members of Gravano's own crew, allegedly Liborio Milito and Joseph D'Angelo and Frank DeCicco, carried out the murder contract for Paul Castellano and not Gravano. The Gravano character also states that his wife Debra, the sister of Nicholas, would be divorcing him after he testified in court about being an accomplice in both before and after the fact of Nicholas' gangland execution, Debra did not.

Dwight Lauderdale

Dwight Lauderdale ( born in Columbus, Ohio) is a former TV news anchor. He was the first African American news anchor in South Florida and became one of the state's most watched and longest running anchors.
Early life.
Dwight Lauderdale was born and raised in a working-class suburb of Columbus, Ohio.
He describes his parents as "hardworking". "My parents" he says " were strict disciplinarians, and while I thought it was unfair back then, I'm glad they were that way because it kept me out of trouble " His father, in particular, taught him the importance of being himself. 
"My father" he says " taught me to never allow anyone to define who I am, that I am the only one who can do that. He taught me
to not think of myself as a victim " 
He took this lesson to heart and started on a path that would include entering and winning many oratorical (speech) contests that eventually led to him being publicly recognized in local newspaper articles. One such article would lead to a phone call that would set him on the path to become South Florida's first black anchor.
Career.
At age 17, after winning an oratorical contest, Lauderdale received a job offer from the news director at WTVN-TV (ABC) in Columbus. He accepted the job and started work in November 1968, part-time at night, processing film. (Some sources claim it was WSYX-TV). He did not have to drop school to accept the job. He did everything from processing film, to writing news copy, to producing, and for on-air talent. He completed his education at Ohio University, majoring in Communications and graduating "cum laude" in 1973.
In 1974, Lauderdale moved to South Florida for a reporting opportunity at Channel 7 (WCKT-TV, at the time). Two years later, WPLG offered him a three-year contract as a reporter/weekend anchor, and he accepted the job. He quickly established himself as a prolific street reporter, working half a dozen stories per day, including the Mariel Boatlift. He also managed to score the first one-on-one interview of Bill Clinton's presidency. More than anything, he remembers the rigid ground rules: " Seven minutes only, and they were standing there with a stopwatch". He was bumped up to the weeknight anchor desk in June 1985 on an interim basis, which was made permanent the following January. His first anchor partner was Ann Bishop and later shared anchoring duties with Diane Magnum, Kristi Krueger and Laurie Jennings.
Lasik.
In July 2004, Lauderdale had his Lasik surgery televised. Lauderdale, who was farsighted, learned that he might be a candidate for corrective eye surgery after viewing a news story about this surgery on his own station. Lauderdale sought a consultation when he realized just how critical the surgery was to his job performance. He never had a problem reading the teleprompter, which was 20 feet away from him, but did have a problem one time when he had to read from a script without his glasses. Lauderdale was treated by monovision and modified monovision (two strategies to treat each eye, one for reading and one for distance).
Retirement.
On February 25, 2008, Dwight Lauderdale announced that he would be retiring in May of that year. WPLG's final broadcast with Lauderdale as an anchor was on May 22, 2008.
Awards.
Dwight Lauderdale has been awarded the N.A.T.A.S Silver Circle Award, The Ohio State Award, and two Florida Emmy's, as well as a Sun-Sentinel reader's award in 1998 as the number one Anchor in the market. South Florida Magazine named him best news anchor in 1990. Additionally, Dwight Lauderdale has a scholarship in his name (The Dwight Lauderdale Scholarship) at Barry University which is awarded to students in broadcast communications each seminar.

Lanny D. Schmidt

Lanny D. Schmidt (born May 6, 1938, Waukegan, Illinois) is an American chemist, inventor, author, and Regents Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota. He is well known for his extensive work in surface science, detailed chemistry (microkinetics), reaction engineering, catalysis, and renewable energy. He is also well known for his work on millisecond reactors and reactive flash volatilization.
Education and acclaim.
Schmidt received a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry in 1960 from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. From 1960 to 1964, he attended the University of Chicago, where he received a Ph.D. degree in Physical Chemistry and was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. Among many research endeavors, his thesis on alkali metal adsorption was supervised by Professor Robert Gomer. In 1965, he completed a postdoctoral year at the University of Chicago.
Research at Minnesota.
In 1965, he joined the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota as an assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. Professor Schmidt's research focused on various aspects of the chemistry and engineering of chemical reactions on solid surfaces. Reaction systems of recent interest are catalytic combustion processes to produce products such as syngas, olefins, and oxygenates by partial oxidation, NOx removal, and incineration by total oxidation. One topic of his research is the characterization of adsorption and reactions on well-defined single-crystal surfaces. A second research topic is steady state and transient reaction kinetics under conditions from ultrahigh vacuum to atmospheric pressure. Professor Schmidt also researches catalytic reaction engineering, in which detailed models of reactors are constructed to simulate industrial reactor performance, with particular emphasis on chemical synthesis and on catalytic combustion.
Current research.
Professor Schmidt's research since the early 1990s has focused on the catalytic partial oxidation of alkanes (particularly methane) and oxygenates in continuous flow fixed bed supported catalyst reactors. In 2004, Schmidt and his graduate students demonstrated that biomass-derived ethanol could be converted to molecular hydrogen for fuel cell at greater than 100% selectivity. The significant potential of this discovery has been well-described:
There is, however, a better way of storing the hydrogen needed for fuel cells: in ethanol, each molecule of which bundles six hydrogen atoms, two carbon atoms, and one oxygen atom into a package far more compact than gaseous hydrogen. Until recently, no one could figure out how to unbundle the ethanol molecules in an energy-efficient way. But Lanny Schmidt, a chemical engineer at the University of Minnesota, may now have found a silver bullet. He has developed a glass tube containing a series of metal plates about the size of a Bic lighter. Made out of the exotic metals rhodium and cerium, these plates can suck the hydrogen out of ethanol and feed it into a fuel cell. (Ironically, Schmidt had been looking for a catalyst that would strip hydrogen from plain old gasoline, but the ethanol turned out to work even better.)" — Sam Jaffe, "Washington Monthly"
The discovery has been referenced over 200 times, and it led to Schmidt being listed among the Scientific American top 50 researchers of 2004.
Academic accomplishments.
Professor Schmidt has published over 350 papers in refereed journals and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He has supervised approximately 90 Ph.D. theses and 15 M.S. theses at Minnesota, and 14 of his former students hold university teaching positions. In 2013, he was awarded the Neal R. Amundson Award at the 3rd North American Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering. Professor Schmidt has previously been awarded the Parravano Award (1997) by the Michigan Catalysis Society, the Alpha Xi Sigma Award (1993) by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and a Humboldt Prize (1994) from Germany. He has been honored by several institutions through supported lectures including the Reilly Lectures (1990) at Notre Dame, the Dodge Lectures (1992) at Yale University, the Mason Lectures (1996) at Stanford University, the Merck Lecture (1997) at Rutgers University, the Centennial Lecture (1997) at Purdue University, the Schiut Lecture (1997) at the University of Delaware and the Hottell Lecture (1999) at MIT. In 2000, he was a plenary speaker at the International Congress on Catalysis in Spain, and in 1998 he served as the Fairchild Scholar at the California Institute of Technology.
Policy and public service.
Throughout his career, Professor Schmidt has promoted the importance of reaction engineering to chemical engineering and chemistry as a separate discipline. In 2004, he published the second edition of his best-selling textbook, "The Engineering of Chemical Reactions," which stressed the importance of the relationships between thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport phenomena for a full understanding of reactor design.
Since 2003, Professor Schmidt has been a strong advocate of biomass-derived energy and a supporter of biomass processing research as a solution to the decreasing petroleum supply. He frequently argues that thermochemical (non-biological) biomass conversion processes have significant advantages over biological processes that will eventually permit small-scale, highly efficient biomass-to-fuel chemical plants.
Achievements and key publications.
Professor Schmidt has authored the following journal articles describing significant advances in chemical reaction engineering:

George Sopkin

George Sopkin (c. 1914 – October 28, 2008) was an American cellist who was a founding member of the Fine Arts Quartet and faculty member at Kneisel Hall School of Chamber Music in Blue Hill, Maine.
Sopkin grew up in Chicago and was about 12 years old when he first played the cello. By age 18, he was auditioning for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Frederick Stock, looked at Sopkin and said, "So we're taking Boy Scouts now?". Stock gave him the job, making him one of the youngest performers with the orchestra. He earned $65 per week for the symphony's 28-week season, plus a seven-week summer session, a respectable income for the Great Depression, especially for a teenager. Sopkin spent eight years with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
He left in symphony in 1941 to form the Fine Arts Quartet together with violinist Leonard Sorkin, who had also performed with the Chicago Symphony. Sopkin served together with other musicians in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II in Orlando, Florida. Sopkin and other musicians made records of their performances that were sold at the PX.
After returning from military service, the Fine Arts Quartet was revived, operating in Chicago under the auspices of the American Broadcasting Company. The members of the quartet joined the music faculty of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1964, and the quartet relocated there.
Sopkin left the Fine Arts Quartet in 1979 following a hand injury and a detached retina, but continued to make occasional guest appearances with the group. Violinist Abram Loft, who played with the quartet from 1954 until 1979 noted that they had made 60 records and played in 270 cities in 28 countries during the 25 years they spent together in the quartet.
After retiring and moving to Maine, Sopkin became involved with the annual school and chamber music festival at Kneisel Hall, joining the school's staff in 1995. He advocated for the additions of sessions for adult and amateur musicians. He pushed for the creation of the annual House concerts, which have provided a major source of additional revenue for the school. Sopkin's efforts led to bringing students to Maine early so that they could perform in area schools before the summer programs began.

Tell es-Safi

Tell es-Safi (Arabic: تل الصافي, Tall aṣ-Ṣāfī, "the white hill"; Hebrew: תל צפית, Tel Tzafit) was a Palestinian village, located on the southern banks of Wadi 'Ajjur, northwest of Hebron that was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war on orders of Shimon Avidan, commander of the Givati Brigade.
Archaeological excavations at the site reveal that it had been continuously inhabited since the 5th millennium BCE. On the Madaba Map, the name is "Saphitha", while the Crusaders called it "Blanch Garde". It is mentioned by Arab geographers in the 13th and 16th centuries. Under the Ottoman Empire, it was part of the district of Gaza. In modern times, the houses were built of sun-dried brick. The villagers were Muslim and cultivated cereals and orchards. 
Today Tell es-Safi is an archaeological site known as Tel Tzafit. The remains of the Crusader fort and the Arab village can still be seen on the tel.
History.
Tell es-Safi sits on a site above the plain of Philistia and above sea level, and its white-faced precipices can be seen from the north and west from several hours distant. Excavations there indicate that the site was settled, "virtually continuously from the Chalcolithic until the modern periods." Stratigraphic evidence attests to settlement in the Late Bronze and Iron Age (I & II) periods. A large city in the Iron Age, the site was "enclosed on three sides by a large man-made siege-moat." 
Some archaeologists believe that Tell es-Safi was the site of the Philistine city "Gath", though the identification is uncertain and was opposed by Albright. The place appears on the Madaba Map as "Saphitha". Israeli archeologists have uncovered a Philistine temple and evidence of a major earthquake in biblical times. Other major finds were evidence of the destruction of Gath by Hazael King of Aram-Damascus around 830 BCE, and evidence of the first Philistine settlement in Canaan.
During the Crusades, the site was called "Blanch Garde" ("White guard"), likely referring to the white rock outcrop next to the site. Richard Lion-Heart was nearly captured while inspecting his troops next to the site. During this period a fort was built on the site, this fort was later destroyed by Saladin. The remnants of the castle of Blanchegarde, erected in 1141 by Fulk of Anjou, dismantled after being taken by Saladin in 1191, reconstructed by Richard of England in 1192, and retaken by Muslims forces shortly thereafter, served as a place of some importance in the village for centuries.
Yaqut al-Hamawi, writing in the 1220s, described the place as a fort near Bayt Jibrin in the Ramleh area, while the Arab geographer Mujir al-Din al-Hanbali (d. ca. 1522), noted that the village was within the administrative jurisdiction of Gaza.
In 1596 Tell al-Safi was a village in the Ottoman Empire, "nahiya" (subdistrict) of Gaza under the "liwa"' (district) of Gaza, with a population of 484. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, barley and sesame, and fruits, as well as goats and beehives.
In the late 19th century, Tell al-Safi was described as a village built of adobe brick with a well in the valley to the north. James Hastings notes that the village contained a sacred "walī".
The villagers of Tall al-Safi were Muslim, and they had a mosque, a marketplace, and a shrine for a local sage called Shaykh Mohammad. In 1944 a total of 19,716 dunums of land were used for cereals, while 696 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards.
1948, and after.
In 1948, Tell es-Safi was the destination for the women and children of Qastina, sent away by the menfolk of Qastina at this time, but they returned after discovering there was insufficient water in the host village to meet the newcomers' needs.
On 7 July Givati commander Shimon Avidan issued orders to the 51st Battalion to take the Tall al-Safi area and "to destroy, to kill and to expel ["lehashmid, leharog, u´legaresh"] refugees encamped in the area, in order to prevent enemy infiltration from the east to this important position." According to Benny Morris, the nature of the written order and, presumably, accompanying oral explanations, probably left little doubt in the battalion OC's minds that Avidan wanted the area cleared of inhabitants.
In 1992, Walid Khalidi wrote that the site was overgrown with wild vegetation, mainly foxtail and thorny plants, interspersed with cactuses, date-palm and olive trees. He noted the remains of a well and the crumbling stone walls of a pool. The surrounding land was planted by Israeli farmers with citrus trees, sunflowers, and grain. A few tents belonging to Bedouin were occasionally pitched nearby.

Caladoc

Caladoc is a red French wine grape variety planted primarily in the southern wine regions such as the Languedoc. The grape is a crossing of Grenache and Malbec created by Paul Truel in 1958 at "Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique" (INRA).
While the grape is used in several "vin de pays" in the Languedoc and Provence wine regions, it is not officially permitted in any "Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée" (AOC) wines.
History.
Caladoc was created by grape breeder Paul Truel at the "Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique" in 1958. The grape as a crossing between Grenache and Malbec that Truel created with the aim of having a vine that could grow in southern France that was less prone to coulure than either of its parents.
Wine regions.
While Caladoc is officially not permitted in any AOC wines, several winemakers in southern France (most notably the Languedoc and Provence) have experimented with the variety in red "vin de pays" blends. Outside of France there are limited plantings in Lebanon, Bulgaria, Russia, South America and Portugal.
Wine styles.
Caladoc grapes have high phenolic levels that produce wines with significant tannins levels and dark red colors. In blends the grape can contribute to the aroma of the wine, sharing many of the same fruity and spicy aromas (such as loganberry) as its parent grapes.
Synonyms.
The only synonym of Caladoc is Kaladok (which is a latin transliteration of the slavic transliteration: Каладок).

Colorino

Colorino is a red Italian wine grape variety planted primarily in Tuscany. The grape is known for its deep dark coloring and is used primarily as a coloring agent in red blends. In the history of Chianti it played a minor role, mostly for its affinity and use to the "governo" winemaking technique. Like Canaiolo, Colorino did not rot easily while going through the partial drying process to later be added to the fermenting grape must. However the grape did not provide the same level of fruit and softening effect that Canaiolo did and fell out of favor. In the late 1980s, there was a surge of interest in the variety among Tuscan winemakers who saw in this local grape variety similarity to the role Petit Verdot plays in Bordeaux blends. Colorino was planted and used to add darker colors and structure from phenolic compounds in the grape's thick skin without the overpowering aromatics that Cabernet Sauvignon could add. This enthusiasm was short lived and by the turn of the 21st century Colorino returned once again to a minor role in Tuscan wines. 
Wine regions.
In addition to Tuscany, the grape is also found in the Umbria region of Central Italy. It is a principle grape variety in the "Denominazione di Origine Controllata" (DOC) wines of Montecarlo in Tuscany as well as Rosso Orvietano and Lago di Corbara in Umbria.
Synonyms.
Colorino is known under a variety of synonyms throughout Italy. These include Abrostine, Abrostino, Abrostolo Dolce, Abrustano Nero, Broustina Rose, Colore, Colorino di Lucca, Colorino di Valdarno, Colorino Pisano, Jomarello, Lambrusco, Raversusto and Tintiglia Ii.

Base station identity code

The Base Station Identity Code (BSIC), is a code used in GSM to uniquely identify a base station. The code is needed because it is possible that mobile stations receive the broadcast channel of more than one base station on the same frequency. This is due to frequency re-use in a cellular network. The BSIC is defined in GSM specification 03.03 section 4.3.2.
Each base-station has its own BSIC, this code is at all times transmitted on the broadcast channel, so the Mobile Stations can distinguish between base stations. The BSIC is composed of a 3-bit Network Color Code (NCC) and a 3-bit Base station Color Code (BCC). The NCC is assigned to each network provider so the MS can sort out which base-stations it is allowed to camp on. The NCC of different providers must be different, also in national border-areas. The BCCHs (Broadcast Control Channel) of each base stations are assigned frequencies by the network operator, and must be assigned such that no neighbor stations have equal BCCH and thus equal BSIC.
As long as base stations use different frequencies for their broadcasting channel, there is no problem in using the same Base Station Identity Code. Unique identification of a base station is especially important in border areas, where at both sides of the border there is a different operator who might use the same broadcasting channel on the same frequency

Frappato di Vittoria or Frappato is a red Italian wine grape variety planted primarily in Sicily. As a varietal, Frappato produces light bodied wines with a distinct grapey aroma. It is most commonly seen as a component of Sicily's only DOCG wine, Cerasuolo di Vittoria, which consists of 30-50% Frappato and 50-70% Nero d'Avola.
An Italian study published in 2008 using DNA typing showed a close genetic relationship between Sangiovese on the one hand and ten other Italian grape varieties on the other hand, including Frappato. It is therefore likely that Frappato is a crossing of Sangiovese and another, so far unidentified, grape variety.

Kosheh Massacres

21 Coptic Christians were the victims of a massacre in el-Kosheh village in Upper Egypt, located 450 kilometres south of Cairo, on Sunday 2 January 2000. The Coptic Christians killed in this incident were considered martyrs of the Coptic Orthodox Church by Pope Shenouda III.
Kosheh.
Kosheh is located on the east bank of the Nile in Sohag governorate, a few miles east of Balyana. The population of Kosheh is about 35,000 and 70% of the village are Christian Copts. Kosheh is the trading center for a number of villages in the area. There is little farmland in Kosheh; it serves rather as the shopping nexus for the rural areas around it. Most of the shopkeepers are Copts, while most of the farmers in the surrounding villages are Muslims.
First Kosheh Massacre.
Tensions between Christians and Muslims had started a few years earlier, in August 1998, in what is known as the First Kosheh Massacre. In this incident, two Copts were murdered by Muslims. The Muslims in turn were allegedly seeking revenge for the “poisoning” of a brother who had actually died of natural causes. In response, the Egyptian police responded by rounding up about 1,200 Christians for investigation into the murder. When Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, criticised the arrests, he was himself arrested with two of his priests, and was charged with inciting strife and damaging national unity between Christians and Muslims.
In October 1998, an article by Christina Lamb in London’s Daily Telegraph reported that some of the arrested Copts had undergone mock crucifixions and that Metropolitan Wissa faced possible execution. The Egyptian government was outraged at the negative publicity, and arrested the head of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), whom it accused of having given the story to the Daily Telegraph. The head of the EOHR and Metropolitan Wissa were eventually released. Although the government promised to punish any police who had acted improperly, some of the police officers involved in the human rights violations against the Copts in el-Kosheh were in fact promoted. Thus, the First Kosheh Massacre turned into an international incident. As a result, Coptic groups in the West began to push for the US Congress to include Egypt among nations that discriminate against Christians.
Second Kosheh Massacre.
The Second Kosheh Massacre took place about one year later, on Friday 31 December 1999. The incidence stemmed from a quarrel between a Christian merchant and a Muslim customer. The misunderstanding strained Muslim-Christian relations in the community. Relatives of the Muslim customer targeted Christian-owned shops and homes, which were looted, destroyed, and burned. Initially, the police was able to contain the situation. However, two days later on Sunday 2 January 2000, riots spread violence into neighbouring villages and lead to the murders of 21 Christians. One Muslim was also accidentally shot dead by a fellow Muslim. More than 40 people were injured in the two-day incident. 260 shops, houses and kiosks were also deliberately burnt or damaged. Most of the killings took place in the outskirts of el-Kosheh, especially in the agriculture fields. This event was one of Egypt's bloodiest massacres.
The local authorities during the incident did little to control the situation. There were some cases where these officers participated in the killings.
Following the massacre, the entire Coptic community felt that these events epitomised the criminal negligence of the Egyptian administration, represented in its police force, when it comes to protecting Coptic lives and property. Since local police units are often drawn from the local community, local feuds including Muslim resentment of Christian families can very well color police behaviour.
On 1 December 2000, a criminal court in Egypt's Sohag governorate released without bail all 89 defendants charged in the New Year's massacre in el-Kosheh. It was unprecedented in Egypt that several dozen murder suspects would be released without bail a month before their verdict was determined. All suspects that were initially arrested in connection to this massacre were eventually acquitted had their charges dropped. The only person convicted in the massacre was a Muslim charged with accidental killing of another Muslim, and sentenced to 13 years in prison. No one was ever convicted for the murder of the 21 Christian victims. This led to outrage in the Coptic community who felt that these suspects should be in custody. The Pope of Alexandria Shenouda III rejected the verdict openly, and told reporters "We want to challenge this ruling. We don't accept it." Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, called the ruling "A shame that defames the reputation of Egypt and an invitation for more violence". Egypt's Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahid appealed the acquittal verdict of the defendants, stating that "there is no doubt that 21 people were killed, and the killers must be brought to justice," "We never imagined that they would release the killers, but this is Egypt" a Copt from el-Kosheh admitted by telephone.
Six days following the acquittal of the defendants, the homes of four Christian families in el-Kosheh were set to fire and completely destroyed. One of the homeowners who reported the arson to the Egyptian police was tortured and forced to sign a statement prepared by a public prosecutor charging him with perpetrating the whole incident. He was subsequently forced to post bail for his own release.

Ville Radieuse

Ville Radieuse (, "Radiant City") was an unrealised project designed by the French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier in 1924.
Although Le Corbusier had exhibited his ideas for the ideal city, the Ville Contemporaine in the 1920s, during contact with international planners he began work on the "Ville Radieuse". In 1930 he had become an active member of the syndicalist movement and proposed the "Ville Radieuse" as a blueprint of social reform.
The principles of the "Ville Radieuse" were incorporated into his later publication, the Athens Charter published in 1943.
His utopian ideal formed the basis of a number of urban plans during the 1930s and 1940s culminating in the design and construction of the first Unité d’Habitation in Marseilles in 1952.
The development of an ideal.
In the late 1920s Le Corbusier lost confidence in big business to realise his dreams of utopia represented in the Ville Contemporaine and Plan Voisin (1925). Influenced by the linear city ideas of Milyutin and the theories of the syndicalist movement (that he had recently joined) he formulated a new vision of the ideal city, the "Ville Radieuse". It represented an utopian dream to reunite man within a well-ordered environment. Unlike the radial design of the Ville Contemporaine, the "Ville Radieuse" was a linear city based upon the abstract shape of the human body with head, spine, arms and legs. The design maintained the idea of high-rise housing blocks, free circulation and abundant green spaces proposed in his earlier work. The blocks of housing were laid out in long lines stepping in and out. Like the Swiss Pavilion they were glazed on their south side and were raised up on pilotis. They had roof terraces and running tracks on their roofs.
The "Ville Radieuse" also made reference to Corbusier's work in Russia. In 1930, he wrote a 59 page "Reply to Moscow" when commenting upon a competition in Moscow. The report contained drawings defining an alternative urban model for the planning of the city. He exhibited the first representations of his ideas at the third CIAM meeting in Brussels in 1930 (although he withdrew the Moscow proposals). In addition he developed proposals for the Ferme Radieuse (Radiant Farm) and Village Radieuse (Radiant Village).
Spreading the idea.
Throughout the thirties Le Corbusier spread the message of his new, ideal city. Discussions at the fourth CIAM meeting on board the SS Patris bound for Athens were incorporated into Corbusier's book, The Radiant City (published in 1935). This in turn influenced the Athens Charter.
Between 1931 and 1940 Corbusier undertook a series of town planning proposals for Algiers. During that period Algiers was the administrative capital of French North Africa. Although he was not officially invited to submit proposals for the city, he knew the mayor was interested so he tried his luck. The plan had to incorporate the existing casbah whilst allowing for the linear growth of the increasing population. The resulting Obus Plan was a variation on the "Ville Radieuse", adapted for a very specific culture and landscape. It comprised four main elements: an administration area by the water in two slab blocks, convex and concave apartment blocks for the middle classes up on the slopes above the city, an elevated roadway on a north-south axis above the casbah and a meandering viaduct with a road on top meandering down the coast.
In 1933 in Nemours, North Africa he proposed eighteen Unité apartment blocks orientated north-south against a backdrop of mountains.
On his 1935 trip to the United States, Corbusier criticised the skyscrapers of Manhattan for being too small and too close together. He proposed replacing all the existing buildings with one huge Cartesian Skyscraper equipped with living and working units. This would have cleared the way for more parkland, thus conforming to the ideals of the "Ville Radieuse".
Even as late as the 1940s he was trying to court both Mussolini and the Vichy government to adopt his ideal city plans.
From 1945 to 1952 he undertook the design and construction of the Unité d'Habitation in Marseilles. The Unité embodied the ideas of the "Ville Radieuse" that he had developed in Nemours and Algiers.
Criticism.
New Urbanists such as James Howard Kunstler criticise the "Ville Radieuse" concept for its lack of human scale and connection to its surroundings. It is, in Lewis Mumford's phrase, "buildings in a parking lot." "The space between the high-rises floating in a superblock became instant wastelands, shunned by the public."
The "Empire State Plaza", a complex of state office buildings in Albany, New York has been criticized for its adherence to the concept. Architecture critic Martin Filler, quoted in "The Making Of Empire State Plaza", says

Liu Zi

Liu Zi (劉滋) (729 – November 19, 794), courtesy name Gongmao (公茂), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, briefly serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong.
Background.
Liu Zi was born in 729, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family traced its ancestry to the imperial house of Han Dynasty and a line of officials of the Jin Dynasty (265-420), Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Sui Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty.
Career prior to chancellorship.
Because of his heritage, Liu Zi was made a scribe to the crown prince when he was young. He later served as the magistrate of Lianshui County (漣水, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu). Thereafter, the deputy minister of civil service affairs, Yang Wan, recommended him as someone who can serve as an advisor to the emperor, and so he was recalled to be "Zuo Bujue" (左補闕), a low-level official at the examination bureau of government (門下省, "Menxia Sheng"). He later resigned in order to take care of his mother, then at the eastern capital Luoyang, and while there, Li Yi (李廙) the mayor of Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the Luoyang region) commissioned him to be a civil service officer. When his mother died, he left government service to observe a period of mourning for her. After the period of mourning was over, he was recalled to the imperial government to serve as "Tuntian Yuanwailang" (屯田員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (工部, "Gongbu"). He later served as "Sixun Yuanwailang" (司勳員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, "Lìbu"), but took on the additional responsibility of selecting low level officials. It was said that he was diligent in his duties and followed the law. He was later promoted to be "Sixun Langzhong" (司勳郎中), the supervisor of the officials who served as "Sixun Yuanwailang", and yet later became an imperial attendant (給事中, "Geishizhong").
In 783, Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong was forced to flee the capital Chang'an when soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) mutinied and supported the general Zhu Ci as their leader. Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). Liu Zi followed him there, and served as deputy minister of worship (太常少卿, "Taichang Shaoqing"), in charge of ceremonies. In 784, he was made the deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, "Libu Shilang"). At that time, as the persons from the southern parts of the empire, who normally would have gone to Chang'an to stand for imperial examinations, were unable to do so due to the wars and the famine in the Chang'an region at the time, Emperor Dezong sent Liu to Hong Prefecture (洪州, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), to examine them there. It was said that he carried out his duties well there.
During and after chancellorship.
In 786, Liu Zi was made "Zuo Sanqi Changshi" (左散騎常侍), a high-level consultant at the examination bureau, and given the designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor "de facto", along with Qi Ying and Cui Zao. It was said that Emperor Dezong gave Cui the responsibilities because Cui was daring to speak and act, and that Liu and Qi were both thus yielding much of the responsibilities to Cui. Emperor Dezong also put the chancellors in direct command over the six ministries of the executive bureau (尚書省, "Shangshu Sheng"), and Liu was given the responsibilities over the ministries of civil service affair and rites (禮部, "Lǐbu", notice different tone than the ministry of civil service affairs). In 787, he was removed from his chancellor position and served as "Zuo Sanqi Changshi" only. In 788, he was again deputy minister of civil service affairs, and in 790 he was made the minister of civil service affairs. While Dou Can was chancellor, because Dou wanted to also be minister of civil service affairs, Liu was made the minister of justice (刑部尚書, "Xingbu Shangshu"). Soon thereafter, Liu was indicted by imperial censor Wei Zhenbo (韋貞伯) for having been insufficiently selective when selecting officials at the ministry of civil service affairs, and he, while not demoted, was stripped of the privilege of wearing gold and purple as due an official of his rank, along with his deputy minister Du Huangshang. Despite this, Liu's biography in the "Book of Tang" stated that he was well-learned, good at commenting, frugal, hard-working, and hated wickedness, and that while selecting officials, he was careful in examining officials' qualifications. It also stated that, as a result, those who submitted false credentials were particularly fearful of him. He died in 794 and was given posthumous honors.

Piano Concerto (Ireland)

The Piano Concerto in E-flat was John Ireland’s only concerto. It was composed in 1930, and given its first performance on 2 October of that year by its dedicatee, Helen Perkin (1909-1996), at a Promenade Concert in the Queen's Hall. The work was an immediate success, and it was frequently performed by pianists such as Clifford Curzon, Moura Lympany, Eileen Joyce, Gina Bachauer and Arthur Rubinstein. While it is considered one of the best piano concertos ever written by an Englishman, it is not often heard nowadays and is not part of the standard repertoire.
Encouraged by its success, Ireland planned to write a second concerto, but he only completed one movement, which he called "Legend". This was also dedicated to Helen Perkin, and she performed it for the first time on 12 January 1934, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Adrian Boult.
Ireland was romantically interested in Perkin, but these feelings were not reciprocated. Perkin took up with George Mountford Adie, a disciple of George Gurdjieff, later marrying him and moving with him to Australia. As a result, Ireland withdrew the dedications of both works.
Helen Perkin had played Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 at the Royal College of Music, and it is likely Ireland heard this performance and was influenced by the Russian's work. He had not, however, heard Ravel’s G major Concerto since it did not appear until after Ireland’s concerto was published. It is interesting, therefore, that many commentators see echoes in Ireland's concerto not only of Prokofiev's concerto, but also of Ravel's. In its jazzy rhythms, there are also hints of George Gershwin.
The first person to record the Piano Concerto in E-flat was Eileen Joyce, in 1942, with the Hallé Orchestra under Leslie Heward. She was also the soloist when the concerto was played at a special Proms concert in 1949 to celebrate Ireland's 70th birthday (this performance was also recorded, and released commercially). After the concert, Eileen Joyce and her partner took Ireland to dinner, and Percy Grainger also attended. The concerto was again played at Ireland's 80th birthday concert. It has also been recorded by Eric Parkin (twice), Piers Lane, Kathryn Stott, Colin Horsley, Geoffrey Tozer and John Lenehan.
The Piano Concerto is in two formal movements; the slow movement leads directly into the finale. Towards the end of the slow movement Ireland quotes a melody from Helen Perkin's String Quartet, with which she had earlier won the Royal College of Music's Cobbett Prize for Composition.

USS Wexford County (LST-1168)

USS "Wexford County" (LST-1168), previously USS "LST-1168", was a United States Navy landing ship tank (LST) in commission from 1953 to 1971, which saw service in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific and served in the Vietnam War..
Construction and commissioning.
USS "LST-1168" was laid down on 27 February 1952 by the Christy Corporation, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. She was launched on 28 November 1953, sponsored by Mrs. Philip K. Wrigley, and commissioned on 15 June 1954 with Lieutenant Commander Victor Vansant in command.
Atlantic and Caribbean service.
Following commissioning, "LST-1168" was assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet with a home port at Norfolk, Virginia. She spent the remainder of 1954 in training, shakedown, upkeep, and independent ship exercises.
On 14 February 1955, "LST-1168" departed Norfolk for a three-month tour of duty in the Caribbean, operating from the Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. While in the Caribbean, the ship visited San Juan and Ponce, Puerto Rico and St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. Upon returning to Norfolk in May, she engaged in exercises and spent the summer of 1955 on United States Naval Reserve cruises and midshipmen training exercises. Her name was changed from USS "LST—1168" to USS "Wexford County" (LST-1168) on 1 July 1955.
In late 1955, "Wexford County" entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for overhaul and remained there into April 1956. She completed overhaul and arrived at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia Beach, Virginia, on 4 April 1956. The ship then participated in United States East Coast operations until July 1956, when she deployed to the Caribbean. After stops at Vieques Island and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, she returned briefly to Little Creek, then set out for the United States West Coast via the Panama Canal.
Pacific service.
"Wexford County" arrived at Long Beach, California, on 2 September 1956 and spent the rest of 1956 conducting routine operations off the California coast.
In January 1957, "Wexford County" reported to Long Beach for overhaul and remained there until April 1957. She departed for San Francisco, California, on 4 April 1957 and entered an upkeep period which lasted until 20 June 1957. She arrived at San Diego, California, on 22 July 1957, where she continued operations along the California coast.
"Wexford County" departed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and her first deployment to the Western Pacific on 23 January 1958 en route to Yokosuka, Japan. From Yokosuka, the ship made stops in Hong Kong; Sasebo, Japan; and Inchon, South Korea. On 24 June 1958, she left for San Diego and arrived there on 18 August 1958. After several months of activity, she went into upkeep on 5 December 1958 at Long Beach.
On 29 January 1959, "Wexford County" departed for Yokosuka again via Hong Kong and Okinawa. She arrived at Yokosuka on 24 March 1959. The ship made several shuttles between Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan, and Naha, Okinawa. She left Yokosuka for San Diego, arriving there on 7 June 1959. The remainder of 1959 was spent in exercises off the coast and routine upkeep.
During the next several years, "Wexford County" was involved in numerous routine operations along the California coast. A highlight of these years was a deployment to Guam, for which she departed San Diego on 2 January 1962. After steaming 5,480 nautical miles (10,149 kilometers), she arrived on 23 January 1962. She conducted operations for reconnaissance and installation of weather stations in the eastern Caroline Islands. The ship returned to San Diego on 1 September 1962. On 10 July 1963, she commenced overhaul at the Naval Station in San Diego, California, which lasted through late November 1963.
January and February 1964 found "Wexford County" engaged in training. She was in a restricted availability status during March and April 1964. In May, she participated in Exercise Pine Tree, in which she served as a secondary control ship. During July 1964, she was in landing ship tank training. This was followed by Exercise Sea Bar, held near Fort Lewis, Washington, in conjunction with the United States Army. In this exercise, "Wexford County" acted as primary control ship. Returning to San Diego in mid-September, "Wexford County" entered upkeep for several weeks. She then took part in amphibious exercises with United States Marine Corps forces. Upon completion of various training exercises, the ship entered a Christmas holiday upkeep period.
In early 1965, "Wexford County" took part in Operation Bubble Ops and Operation Silver Lance, which were at that time the largest peacetime amphibious operations ever conducted in the Pacific Ocean. Shortly after, she departed for Okinawa and Yokosuka, Japan. Following a brief stay, she sailed in early May 1965 for San Diego. During June and July 1965, she carried out local operations.
Vietnam War service.
In August 1965, "Wexford County" again deployed for the Western Pacific and spent September 1965 in Da Nang, South Vietnam. Subsequent stops were made in Chu Lai and Qui Nhon, South Vietnam, and at Hong Kong. In December 1965, "Wexford County" returned to San Diego for the duration of the year.
"Wexford County" was involved in local operations from January through April 1966 and provided services for the Amphibious School, Coronado, California. In late April, she steamed to Newport, Oregon, to participate in Newport's Loyalty Day celebration. On 1 May 1966, "Wexford County" returned to San Diego. On 12 July 1966, she arrived at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in Long Beach, California, for overhaul. She returned to San Diego on 9 November 1966 and began underway and refresher training on 27 November 1966. This training period ended on 16 December 1966.
Amphibious training for "Wexford County" commenced on 16 January 1967 and continued through 27 January 1967. She briefly returned to Long Beach for further repair, then continued on to Hawaii to participate in landing exercises on Moloka'i and to lift U.S. Marine Corps forces to San Diego. In June 1967, "Wexford County" sailed to San Francisco, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, Washington, to embark U.S. Marine Corps troops bound for training at Camp Pendleton, California. She participated in various operations during July 1967, and, in late August, she repeated her stops along the United States West Coast to return Marine Corps units to their respective home ports.
After returning to San Diego in September 1967, "Wexford County" began a tender availability period. Amphibious exercises and deployment preparations lasted through October 1967. In early November 1967, she sailed for South Vietnam by way of Pearl Harbor and Yokosuka. In December 1967, "Wexford County" reached South Vietnam and assumed her duties.
On 4 January 1968, "Wexford County" arrived in Subic Bay, the Philippines, to off-load cargo and departed on 14 January 1968 to return to South Vietnam. She remained on station until 13 March 1968, at which time she left for Subic Bay, arriving there on 16 March 1968. She returned to Vietnam, via Hong Kong, on 5 April 1968 to rejoin forces off Vietnam.
"Wexford County" left Vietnam in early May 1968 and returned to San Diego via Taiwan, Yokosuka, and Pearl Harbor. She arrived in San Diego on 26 June 1968, after approximately seven and one-half months overseas. For the next two months, she was in a restricted availability status.
On 28 August 1968, she got underway for South Bend, Washington, to help celebrate the city's Labor Day festival. She returned to San Diego on 6 September 1968. Throughout September and October 1968, "Wexford County" carried out operations along the California coast. On 15 November 1968, she entered drydock at San Diego.
"Wexford County" got underway on 12 January 1969 with a task group headed for Mazatlán, Mexico, arriving on 18 January 1969. She spent two weeks there involved in various training exercises. In February and March 1969, "Wexford County" was again in San Diego for routine maintenance. She departed for exercises at Treasure Island, California, on 14 April 1969. She sustained heavy damage to a main engine and spent May 1969 undergoing repairs at San Diego.
A midshipmen cruise occupied the months of June and July 1969. August and September 1969 were devoted to exercises, and "Wexford County" spent the rest of 1969 in overhaul at San Diego.
The yard period ended on 20 February 1970. Inspections, training, and preparations for deployment occurred from March through May 1970; and, on 2 June 1970, the ship left for Pearl Harbor and Guam. "Wexford County" reached Guam on 25 June 1970, and, after taking on new cargo, she left for Subic Bay, Philippines, and then to Vietnam. After unloading a construction battalion and their equipment, she departed for Hong Kong, arriving there on 30 July 1970.
From 2 September 1970 through early November 1970, "Wexford County" was involved in numerous troop lifts, cargo transports, and exercises between Okinawa and Yokosuka and Numazu, Japan. On 2 November 1970, she detached and began the voyage back to San Diego via Subic Bay, Guam, Ponape, the Caroline Islands, and Pearl Harbor. She arrived at San Diego on 22 December 1970.
"Wexford County" received a Meritorious Unit Commendation and five battle stars for her Vietnam War service.
Decommissioning and transfer to Spain.
"Wexford County" spent 1971 in preparation for transfer to Spain. She was decommissioned on 29 October 1971 and transferred to the Spanish Navy through the Security Assistance Program that same day, although she was not stricken from the Navy List until 1 November 1976.
In the Spanish Navy, she served as "Martin Alvarez" (L 12) from 1971 until 1995, when she was decommissioned and sold for scrapping.

<doc id="20091356" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20091356" title="Government contract proposal">
Government contract proposal

A government contract proposal, often called a government proposal in business, is a response to written requirements issued by a government entity that wants to buy something. All areas of government (national, state/provincial, and local) use written requirements to buy products or services to make purchasing fair and reduce costs. Outside of business circles, "government proposal" is commonly used to mean a legislative or other proposal by a government, in other words a legislative motion.
Governments request competitive contract proposals when they believe there are more issues than initial cost in buying a needed product or service. In addition to cost, governments often consider issues such as risk (i.e., Will the product or service meet the government need?), schedule (i.e., Will the product or service be delivered or finished in time?), quality (i.e., Will the product or service meet the need each time it is delivered or needed?), long-term cost (i.e., What is the total cost of a product or service over its lifetime?). Most governments use proposals to buy any product that is not a commodity or to buy services that are not routine.
In the United States, federal proposals are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, commonly referred to as the FAR. Most countries have at least some form of purchasing regulations that govern proposals. Regional and local governments have similar laws, although enforcement varies greatly.
Government proposals are written in response to specific requests for proposals (RFPs). The RFPs specify the government's requirements for the product or service it intends to buy. In the United States, federal RFPs also specify, in accordance with the FAR, how the proposal should be prepared (Section L in the RFP) and what criteria will be used to evaluate proposals (Section M) Federal Acquisition Regulations. Other countries, states and local governments may also provide requirements for proposal preparation and evaluation criteria, although this is not always the case.
Government proposal contents.
Most government proposals contain the following sections:
Most government proposals require a quality assurance plan, usually synonymous with AS9100.
Size.
Because government proposals are always produced in response to written requirements, the proposals are lengthy in order to address adequately each requirement and, in the case of competitive proposals, the vendor's need to differentiate its product or service from other vendors. Short government proposals, including cost data, are at least 10 pages. Large proposals can range up to thousands of pages.
Expense.
Government proposals are expensive to produce because of detailed requirements and necessary cost and scheduling information. Experts estimate the cost of producing a successful government proposal to be in the range of 0.5% to 2% of the initial contract value.

Jeanette Baker

Jeanette Baker-Flynn (born 22 April 1955) is an Australian ten-pin bowler. She is the first Australian to win a World Tenpin Championship. She Won the AMF World Cup in 1982 in Scheveningen in the Netherlands and for a second time in 1983 in Mexico City, making her the only athlete to win back-to-back AMF World Cup titles ever. She won both titles from top seed.
Following her victory in Scheveningen, Baker took an office job with AMF in Australia. The Australian Tenpin Bowling Congress took notice, saying that the paid employment with a bowling company made Baker a "professional". This complaint was lodged in the days of "pure" amateurism, but an appeal to the Federation Internationale des Quilleurs, bowling's international governing body, restored Baker's amateur status but not before she had missed out on the 1983 FIQ World Championships.
Baker was named the World Bowling Writers Female Bowler of the Year in 1982 and elected to the (WBW) International Bowling Hall of Fame in 1994.

Casa grande (sugar plantation)

The Casa Grande (Portuguese: "big house") was the Brazilian equivalent to southern plantation in the United States. These Casas Grandes were predominately located in the northeast of Brazil (areas such as present day Bahia and Pernambuco). Additionally sugar cane was grown in the interior of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
The Casa Grande were made up three main components: The Big House, "senzala" (slave quarters, and "engenho" (sugar mill). The master of these sugar producing areas was called the "senhor de engenho" ("master of the sugar works"). His word was always final and he had complete control over the land, the slaves, and the women who made up his plantation community. It is said that the biggest Casa Grande was bigger than Portugal itself. The larger Casas Grandes were self-sustaining since they were so isolated from the more civilized coastal regions. Essential structures that were built were the school, nursery, the infirmary, family chapel,master’s harem, bank, and cemetery.
In the early days it was necessary to maintain an army in the plantation. These armies sometimes were actually very large having up to one hundred Indians/half-breeds. These plantations were equipped represented a largely self-contained economic, social, political, and cultural system.
Master of Sugar Works.
Gilberto Freyre wrote in his book Casa-Grande & Senzala “ Once the Jesuit was overthrown the senhor de engenho dominated colonial life almost without interference. He was the true master of Brazil, more powerful than viceroys or bishops.” He also added “ The truth is that around these senhores de engenho was created the most stable type of civilizations in Hispanic America; and that type of civilization is exemplified by the heavy-set, horizontal architecture of the Big House. These landowners were usually very powerful Portuguese men and they did their best to keep their blood pure. This of course meant heavy inbreeding to keep the aristocracy. Freyre also says in his book that their motto was “ A white woman to marry, a mulatto to take to bed, a Negress to do the work.”
These sugar cane plantations were very similar to the Southern plantations in the United States, being was an industry ran on slave labor which became very powerful in both Brazil and the United States.

Administrative Appeal Act

The is a statute passed in Japan in 1962. Along with the Administrative Litigation Act, it provides rules for the appeal and review of government decisions.
Types of appeal.
There are three types of appeal provided under the Act:
Ordinarily, when the deciding entity has no administrative oversight (e.g. a cabinet ministry, mayor or governor), an objection must be filed in the first instance. When the deciding entity has an overseeing entity, a demand for review must be filed in the first instance. There are a number of exceptions provided by statute, however. Moreover, where the appeal concerns a "failure" to act, either an objection or a demand for review may be used at the discretion of the petitioner.
An objection or demand for review must be filed within 60 days of receiving notice of the act in question, and within one year of the act itself (the one-year limit may be extended upon showing of cause). There is no time limit on filing appeal of an inaction.
All substantive portions of these procedures are conducted in writing, although parties may be called to give oral testimony as part of the process.
Injunctions.
An appeal petition does not ordinarily stop the government from continuing the act in question. However, there are two situations where the government may be enjoined from further action:
Decision.
The response to an objection is called a , and the response to a demand for review is called a . In either case, there may be one of four results:
Should the appeal be accepted, the act in question may be overturned in whole or in part and any past enforcement may be declared invalid (and the appellant restored to their pre-enforcement position). The act may also be amended to the extent necessary to make it legal.
If an appeal of an inaction is accepted, the non-acting entity must act promptly following the acceptance of the appeal.

NJIT Steel Bridge Team

NJIT Steel Bridge Team is a team within the New Jersey Institute of Technology's ASCE chapter). It consists of undergraduate students who are attending at NJIT, majoring in civil engineering, and also members of ASCE. Every year, the team competes against other schools in a steel bridge competition.
Every year, the team has a few fund raising events, which are very crucial for the competition because the team needs to have proper finance in order to order parts and fabricate them. Besides fund raising, sponsors from other corporates and companies are very important too.
A lot of time the team members get together and have outside activities such as hiking, paint ball, go cart, or whatever anyone wants to do. The team also does many productive activities such as visiting high schools and talking about civil engineering and the steel bridge competition. 
There is at least a meeting every week talking about the process of the team and keeping members informed. Meetings are always held during common hours. Sometimes pizzas and drinks are served.
The competition.
The objective of the competition is to design a light bridge yet strong and economically and assembly it fast with as few team members as possible. 
The competition has 3 processes: Design & testing, which students do that themselves using programs, knowledges they learned from classes, and sometimes help from professors and alumni; Fabrication, which is when students grind, weld, and fit the parts together; and finally Assembly, which is when students put the parts together to achieve the designed bridge. 
There are 6 categories in scoring: Display (how the bridge look), construction speed (time management), construction economy (low cost to build), lightness, stiffness (aggregate deflection), and structural efficiency (a formula used to calculate this based on weight and deflection).
The competition occurs every year. It is hosted at different places every time. This year, 2008, the regional competition will be hosted at Polytechnic Institute of NYU, New York, on Saturday April 4, 2009; and the national competition will be hosted at University of Nevada, Las Vegas on May 22 and May 23. 
If there are 1-4 teams competing in the region, the best team will proceed to the national competition
If there are 5-10 teams competing in the region, the 2 best teams will proceed to the national competition
If there are more than 10 teams competing in the region, the 3 best teams will proceed to the national competition
The price for winning the national competition is $2,500
Awards.

The Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park is a historical museum and park located in southern Jessamine County, Kentucky, south of Lexington, Kentucky. It was established in 1863 as a depot for the Union army during the Civil War. It became a recruiting ground for new soldiers from eastern Tennessee and escaped slaves, many of whom trained to be soldiers.
Early history.
Camp Nelson was established as a supply depot for Union invasions into Tennessee. It was named for Major General William "Bull" Nelson, who had recently been murdered. It was placed near Hickman Bridge, the only bridge across the Kentucky River upriver from the state capital (Frankfort, Kentucky). The site was selected to protect the bridge, to have a base of operations in central Kentucky, and to prepare to attack the Cumberland Gap and eastern Tennessee. The camp was also used as a site to train new soldiers for the Union army. The Kentucky River's steep palisades contributed to the selection of the site—they would help defend the camp from Confederate attack.
Camp Nelson may have been the best choice for a central Kentucky depot, but it was inadequate. When Union Major General Ambrose Burnside attacked the Cumberland Gap and Knoxville, Tennessee, Camp Nelson's distance from the Gap and Knoxville, combined with lack of railroads and the weather, hampered the Union advance. When overall Union commander Ulysses S. Grant visited Camp Nelson in January 1864, he was displeased, observing that "no portion of our supplies can be hauled by teams from Camp Nelson". The situation of the camp had not improved by spring of 1864, and Grant leaned toward abandoning it entirely. William Tecumseh Sherman advocated that its role be diminished instead, which saved Camp Nelson. It took on the role of training black soldiers, who volunteered for the US Colored Troops.
In July 1863 and June 1864, Union forces feared that the camp might be attacked by Confederate general John Hunt Morgan, who was conducting raids in Kentucky and other border states, as well as Ohio. In 1863 Morgan was headed for Indiana and Ohio in his most famous raid. It was never confirmed whether he intended to attack the camp in 1864.
Black history.
In August 1863 thousands of slaves forced to build railroads for the Union army were stationed at Camp Nelson. They had escaped to Union lines, or joined Union forces which had taken over rebel areas. The army needed the help of their work. These former slaves, at least 3,000 in number, were the primary builders of Camp Nelson, starting with fortifying Hickman Bridge on May 19, 1863. Prior to Lincoln issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, the Army declared such former slaves as "contraband" and refused to return them to the southern slaveholders, as the Confederacy demanded. The Army did use former slaves as laborers. No blacks enlisted in the USCT in Kentucky until 1864, whereas in other border states, former slaves started enlisting in October 1863.
At Camp Nelson 10,000 African Americans were emancipated from slavery in exchange for service in the Union army. These soldiers sometimes brought their families to Camp Nelson; such refugees totaled 3,060 and were cared for by missionaries. At one point, in November 1864, Camp Nelson was not a legal place of refuge for slaves. The Union soldiers forced out 400 women and children to leave the camp; the refugees suffered 102 deaths due to severe weather until allowed to return to camp. Some 1300 refugees died at Camp Nelson, reflecting the high rate of infectious disease at camps. Camp Nelson was the smallest of the three locations where blacks were trained to become Union soldiers; the others were in Boston, Massachusetts, and New Orleans, Louisiana. In a more rural area than the other former facilities, Camp Nelson is the only one whose land was never developed after the war for other purposes.
The most African-American recruits arrived at the camp between June and October 1864, with 322 men enlisting on a single day on July 25. After that, only 20 more recruits arrive in 1864. In January, 15 signed up, and from February to April 1865, there were six. Among the units raised at Camp Nelson were the 5th and 6th U.S. Colored Cavalry Regiments and the 114th and 116th Colored Heavy Artillery Regiments. After the war, Camp Nelson was a center for giving ex-slaves their emancipation papers. Many have considered the camp as their "cradle of freedom".
After the war, the United States Sanitary Commission (USSC) operated a soldiers' home for a time at Camp Nelson, in former barracks. It was one of a series of homes and rest houses they operated for soldiers.
Today.
Presently, of the original property are preserved as the Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park. Most of the buildings at the camp were sold. The camp is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and was declared a National Historic Landmark District in March 2013.
Camp Nelson is currently controlled by the Jessamine County Fiscal Court. The county and some local leaders would like to transfer Camp Nelson to the National Park Service. The site was designated as part of the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, which runs through several states and has sites in Canada and the Antilles. In 2008 U.S. Representative Ben Chandler was studying funding issues related to such a transfer of property.
The park has more than a mile of walking paths. Ghost tours are occasionally available.
Camp Nelson National Cemetery is two miles to the south. It has organized records of burials online so that families may trace relatives buried here, in addition to those who trained or lived at the camp.

Mesa de Ocaña

Mesa de Ocaña is a comarca in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, in the province of Toledo. Its capital and administrative center is Ocaña. The comarca is located in the northeast part of the province, and encompasses an area that includes several hundred meters of the Tajo River Valley.
The comarca is bordered on the North by Aranjuez (Las Vegas); to the south by Los Yébenes and the comarca; to the West by La Sagra and Toledo; and to the East by the Mancha Alta de Toledo and .
Geography.
Geomorphology.
The altitude changes radically through the region. The height differences between the escarpments of the banks of the Tajo river to the North versus the steppes of La Guardia, and between the valleys and ravines of the Algodor River to the West and those of the Cedrón River to the East, have given rise the region's nickname of "the staircase." The area has a very distinct and unique set of geological formations which set it apart from its neighbors.
Location.
The comarca consists of 1,453.49 km², and contains the following municipalities: Cabañas de Yepes (17.97 km²), Ciruelos(22.94 km²), Dosbarrios (111.59 km²), La Guardia (195.59 km²), Huerta de Valdecarábanos (83.00 km²), Noblejas (69.67 km²), Ocaña (147.91 km²), Ontígola (41.49 km²), Santa Cruz de la Zarza (264.54 km²), Villarrubia de Santiago (155.29 km²), Villasequilla (76.95 km²), Villatobas (181.58 km²), and Yepes (84.97 km²).
Climate.
The comarca's climate can be considered continental mediterranean due to its extreme temperatures. Average summer temperatures are over 26°C, while winters average less than 6°C.
Demographics.
According to the Instituto Nacional de Estadística in 2007, the population of the comarca is 39,175, with an average population density of 26.94 people/km².
The capital of the comarca is Ocaña.
Cultural Heritage.
Mesa de Ocaña has a rich cultural and architectural heritage, not to mention the area's many archeological treasures which document the lives of various different cultures who settled the area throughout the centuries.
One of the most spectacular of these architectural treasures is the "Plaza de Moros" in Villatobas, an Iron Age village whose walls are covered in murals. The ancient town of Ocaña itself is considered a historical monument in and of itself. The town of Yepes was an ecclesiastical dominion during the rule of the archbishop of Toledo, and is now a historical and artistic monument.
The towns which make up the comarca share two common characteristics: a plethora of religious architecture and the remains of ancient medieval fortifications. The many religious buildings -- churches, monasteries, convents, and hermitages -- are reminders of bygone days of military orders and ecclesiastical dominions. Old defensive buildings include castles in Ontígola and Dosbarrios, the ruins of the castle in Valdecarábanos, and the fortress in La Guardia.
Handicrafts.
The local handicrafts are very traditional and varied. These include pottery, a legacy of the Moors, which is popular in Ocaña, Villarrubia de Santiago, Santa Cruz de la Zarza, and Villamuelas. Ironwork, carpetry, wickerwork, basketweaving, cooperage and crafting with glass and ebony, along with the production of wineskins are all popular traditional trades.
Cuisine.
The cuisine of Mesa de Ocaña is typical of Castilla-La Mancha, with many game-based dishes, especially partridge. Other traditional dishes include various types of roasts, lamb stew, gachas, migas, , hare, and "cuchifritos".
Popular desserts include a wide range of sweets and pastries, including , puff pastries, and "borrachos de Ocaña" (literally "the drunks of Ocaña").
In terms of wine, the comarca is a part of the "Denominación de Origen" La Mancha, and its wineries enjoy the same international acclaim as those of . The most-developed winemaking municipalities include Villamuelas, Ocaña, Yepes, Villarrubia de Santiago, Santa Cruz de la Zarza, and Noblejas. Some of these municipalities are considered part of the "Denominación de Origen" Uclés.
These wines tend to be made of Airén, Viura, Macabeo, Tempranillo, Cencibel, Cabernet Sauvignon, or combinations of these.
Monuments and Places of Interest.
Ocaña: the Plaza Mayor, the Palace of the Cárdenas, the Great Fountain, and the Dominican Convent, all of which are registered National Monuments.
Santa Cruz de la Zarza: Church of St. James, Church of St. Michael the Archangel, Convent of the Trinitarian Order, Casa del Gallo, Casa de Chacón, Plaza Mayor, Casa de las Cadenas, Casa de la Tercia, Fountain of the Caños.
Yepes: a declared historic-artistic area, with ancient walls, the Plaza Mayor, and the Church of San Benito Abad.
Villatobas: "Plaza de Moros" archeological site, Shrine of Jesus the Nazarean.
Lillo: the Longar, Altillo, and Albardiosa Lakes, the Don Quixote de la Mancha Aerodome, and the San Pedro Bautista hospice.
Noblejas: Traditional bodegas and "almazaras" (mills for making olive oil).

Surtseyan eruption

A Surtseyan eruption is a type of volcanic eruption that takes place in shallow seas or lakes. It is named after the island of Surtsey off the southern coast of Iceland.
These eruptions are commonly phreatomagmatic eruptions, representing violent explosions caused by rising basaltic or andesitic magma coming into contact with abundant, shallow groundwater or surface water. Tuff rings, pyroclastic cones of primarily ash, are built by explosive disruption of rapidly cooled magma.
Characteristics.
Although similar in nature to phreatomagmatic eruptions, there are several specific characteristics:

Sukhishvili Georgian National Ballet

The Georgian National Ballet () was the first professional state dance company in Georgia. Founded by Iliko Sukhishvili and Nino Ramishvili in 1945, it was initially named as the Georgian State Dance Company. Thanks to this company the Georgian national dancing and music has become known in many parts of the world. 
Throughout its history the Georgian National Ballet has appeared at the Albert Hall, The Coliseum, The Metropolitan Opera and Madison Square Garden, among others. In 1967, La Scala welcomed them - reportedly the first and the only time a folklore group was given a chance to perform on its stage.
The costumes are designed by Simon (Soliko) Virsaladze (1908-1989). Currently, the founders' son Tengiz Sukhishvili is the Artistic Director and General manager of The Georgian National Ballet. His spouse Ms. Inga Tevzadze is also a former dancer, now a ballet master. Iliko Sukhishvili Jr. is a chief choreographer of the Georgian National Ballet today. Nino Sukhishvili is a deputy-manager and costume designer.
The Georgian National Ballet has seventy dancers and a small orchestra.
A performance by the Georgian National Ballet's dancers in which the female dancers, wearing long skirts, appeared to glide across the floor was an inspiration for writer Terry Nation in creating the Daleks for the television series "Doctor Who".

Rajadhiraja St. Mary's Jacobite Syrian Cathedral, Piravom

Rajadhiraja St. Mary's Syrian Orthodox Cathedral (old name, Piravom Valiya Palli), Piravom is one of the prominent syrian orthodox churches in Kerala, under the control of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch. The church is situated on the eastern banks of Muvattupuzha river running through piravom. The river takes 60 degree angle in front on the river which gives scenic view from the church. Though the Church is named after St. Mary, it is popularly known as "Rajakkalude Pally" ("Church of the Kings"), the three Kings visited Jesus during his birth. It is also known as Morth Mariyam Palli.
History.
The word "Piravom" in Malayalam originates from "Piravi" which means birth or nativity.This church was founded in BC 4 by The Three Kings
We could see references to the church in the 16th Century during the Portugal invasion to India. The church has been destroyed and one of church intruded by the Portuguese metropolitan Menesis during the Udayamperoor Synod. Later the people of this church participated in the "Koonan Kurish Satyam’ (Coonen Cross Oath) in AD 1653 and continued as a Syrian Orthodox church.
Features include:
Early History.
About 2000 years ago, after the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem, Judaea, in the days of king Herod, it is said that Wise men from the east (The Magi) reached Bethlehem through Jerusalem. The "star" they saw in the east was moving to direct them till they reached the birthplace of Jesus They saw the young child on the lap of mother Mary, knelt down and worshipped him. They opened their treasures and presented gifts to him: Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh (St. Mathew 2:1-11) and returned to their home land in the east. The Wise men (Holy kings) were scholars, rulers and devotees. The legends name them as Melchior, Gaspar and Balthazar. On their return they are said to have built an edifice in the Indian style and here they began to worship the Holy infant. As such Piravom Valiyapally is the first church in the world, where worshipping Jesus Christ started. During the 5th Century, this building may have been rebuilt as a Christian church as we now see.
In the beginning stages of church the building was in the architectural style of Hindu temples. But later, during the flourishing of Persian culture, the church building was renovated adopting the Persian architecture. The picture of fish, an ancient Christian emblem has a venerable place in the church. The Church was built as a strong fort, in the periods of "Padayottam" (civil wars and banditry) its walls are more than four feet in thickness.
Important Festivals.
Denaha (Annual celebration of the holy Baptism of Christ) on January 6 is the main celebration in the church. The best attraction of the festival is the procession.
The ‘Paithel Nercha’ (the feast for 12 male children) on the Easter Day at the Piravom church is very famous. The ‘Paithel Nercha" is one of the major offerings dedicated to the church. The main part of the offering is 12 infants will sit with the priest who sanctifies the offering and they will be feasted with delicious food.
The Festival of St. George on May 7 and St. Mary on August 15 are other main festivals.
Cathedral declaration.
On 14 April 2012 Piravom Valiya Pally became Rajadhiraja St. Mary's Jacobite Syrian Cathedral. Catholicose Baselios Thomas 1st led Holy " Ezhinmel Kurbana" at St. Mary's SO Valiya Pally Piravom.

Geriatric intensive-care unit

Geriatric intensive care unit is a special intensive care unit dedicated to management of critically ill elderly.
Origin.
Geriatric intensive care units appeared due to the fact that world population is aging. Managing Geriatrics diseases is not like managing adult or pediatrics, especially if they are critically ill. Geriatric medicine was not included in the curricula of undergraduate or advanced medical training until recently, so not all critical care physicians were oriented by the pecularties of geriatric patients. Despite the fact that geriatric patients constitute many of the critically ill patients the training of critical care team still lacks the geriatrics giants.
Elderly admitted to intensive care units can suffer from severe infections as MRSA of systemic fungal infections. And may need special posoperative analgesia. Also elderly need assessment by special instruments to predict the prognosis of ICU patients older than 75 years.
World distribution.
Geriatric care units are present in Japan, USA, China, Egypt & Europe (France, Italy, Poland ).
Training & education programs.
Physicians are trained in geriatric medicine & critical care medicine.
Nurses receive special training in critical care of elderly in their basic training, advanced and clinical training.

Charles Curtis (botanist)

Charles Curtis (1853 – 23 August 1928) was an English botanist who was sent by James Veitch & Sons to search for new plant species in Madagascar, Borneo, Sumatra, Java and the Moluccas, before settling in Penang, where he became the first superintendent of the Penang Botanic Gardens.
Early days.
Curtis was born in Barnstaple, Devon, the youngest of four brothers. His paternal grandfather, a Norman by the name of Courtois, had settled at Barnstaple many years previously. Like his brothers, Curtis worked as a garden boy at the local Bale's Nursery. On completing his education, Curtis joined James Veitch & Sons' Royal Exotic Nursery at Chelsea, London in 1874, where he received his botanical training in the "New Plant Department".
Plant hunting.
In 1878, Harry Veitch despatched him to Mauritius and Madagascar, from where he sent seeds of "Nepenthes madagascariensis", a species of pitcher plant, and various other tropical plants, including "Angraecum sesquipedale". Unfortunately, following "treachery" by one of the African helpers, who cut the rope which held the raft on which the plants were being floated downriver, the first consignment of plants collected was lost and, as a result, the collecting work had to be repeated.
Curtis returned to England in 1879, but a year later was sent to the Dutch East Indies, where he explored Borneo, Sumatra, Java and the Moluccas. Veitch instructed him to collect specimens of "Nepenthes northiana", which had been discovered by Marianne North in Borneo, although the precise locality where the plant grew was unknown. On the trip to Borneo, Curtis was accompanied by a young gardener, David Burke, who later became a plant collector himself. The search for the elusive pitcher plant was unsuccessful, but the pair discovered many other species, including many interesting stove (hot-house) plants, palms, and orchids. At the end of the trip, Curtis accompanied Burke to Singapore, from where Burke returned to England with the collection of plants, including large consignments of the slipper orchids, "Paphiopedilum stonei" and "P. lowii", as well as many Vandas, Rhododendrons, and the beautiful foliage plant for British hot-houses, "Leea amabilis".
From Singapore, Curtis travelled to Pontianak in Dutch Borneo, with the special object of obtaining a consignment of "Phalaenopsis violacea", then known in England but still rare. He was successful in locating the plant, but again, owing to a mishap with the boat, a month's collections and all his clothes and instruments were lost, and he narrowly escaped with his life.
In 1882, Curtis eventually located "Nepenthes northiana" in Borneo and sent seeds back to Chelsea, as well as "N. stenophylla" and seed from a plant that became known as "N. curtisii", although now known as "N. maxima". Curtis was not meticulous in recording where he located individual plants – although it was originally believed that he collected "N. curtisii" in Borneo, Charles Clarke points out that he also visited Sulawesi on the same trip, and "N. maxima" is common there. He also sent back the orchid which was originally named "Paphiopedilum curtisii", although now known as a synonym for "Paphiopedilum superbiens"; Curtis did not reveal where he found the plants, other than saying that this was in Sumatra.
According to the account in "Hortus Veitchii", Curtis had been commissioned to go in search of "Nepenthes northiana", and "after long and unsuccessful effort, Curtis gave up hope, under the impression that Miss North had been wrongly informed, but fortunately before leaving the district it occurred to him to look over a steep escarpment in the hill-side, accomplished by lying prostrate on the ground, when to his great joy he discovered the long-looked-for plant some distance below. He succeeded in gathering ripe capsules, and lost no time in transmitting them to Chelsea, where the seed soon germinated", and was introduced in the James Veitch & Sons catalogue in 1883.
Other plants introduced to England by Curtis, include two species of Vireya rhododendron – "Rhododendron multicolor" (with the red variety "Curtisii" named after him) and "R. teysmannii" (now considered to be subspecies of "R. javanicum") – before he terminated his engagement with Veitch early in 1884.
Honours.
Amongst the many plant species named after Curtis in recognition of his services to botany and horticulture were the following:
He was also honoured by the genus "Curtisina", but the only member of the genus, "Curtisina penangensis", was subsequently identified as a taxonomic synonym of "Dacryodes longifolia".
Penang Botanic Gardens.
In mid-1884, following a recommendation from Kew Gardens, Curtis was appointed to the position as Assistant Superintendent of Forests and Gardens under the Straits Settlements administration. Curtis reported to a Superintendent, Nathaniel Cantley, who was also the Curator of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Curtis was placed in charge of the Penang region of the Forest and Gardens Department, which included the "Waterfall Gardens", together with some 3,575 ha of forest reserves. The forest reserves included areas reserved for recreational, fuel, forestry harvesting and protection purposes, mostly on Penang Island. The Forests and Gardens Department was initially engaged mainly in the cultivation of essential commercial plants, inspecting crops and advising the planting community.
When the department's work in connection with economic crops and forestry was taken over by the Agriculture and Forestry Departments, Curtis was appointed the first superintendent of the newly re-created Penang Botanic Gardens, responsible for the layout of the gardens, and their transformation from an old granite quarry site. The Gardens, as distinct from the Forest Reserves, became Curtis' passion. Curtis was presented with a tropical valley, including a nutmeg plantation with associated structures, and a prominent location on the trail to and at the foot of the "Great Waterfall". While an avid and acknowledged botanist and plant collector, he proved himself to be a creative landscape designer in crafting the design and development of the Gardens.
On accepting the position, Curtis proposed a long term strategy as to the development of the gardens and its potential role as a botanical repository and clearing house. Curtis' immediate actions were to develop a plant nursery and undertake a programme of works to create a pleasurable recreational and botanical garden in the valley. This vision was spelt out in detail in his 1885 annual report to Cantley as part of the Department's Annual Report. This included proposals to extend and develop the existing "Waterfall Gardens", the construction of road circuits, the erection of plant-houses for the propagation and cultivation of various species, and the provision of recreational venues.
His immediate steps in 1885–86 were focussed upon increasing the area of the Gardens in the valley together with improving road and pedestrian access. In his 1885 report, Curtis commented on ""the poor gravelly soil in the valley"" which required that considerable attention should be given to the preparation of the ground for tree planting. However, the ""natural advantages of the surroundings, from a landscape gardening point of view, ... in a great measure compensate for this defect.""
From the outset, Curtis introduced aesthetic considerations into the design of the Gardens, through the strategic placement of trees and the clearance of jungle. The circular road circuits he had constructed carefully weave through the valley opening up views, framing vantage points, and providing surprises to the visitor. Curtis' design was motivated by his objective to take advantage of and exploit the natural landscape in the first instance, and then locate plantings in functional or species family associations. A later curator, Frederick Sydney Banfield, observed of the planting design structure established by Curtis that: ""There is little systematic arrangement even in the botanical sections, the principal aim having been to arrange the plants in such a way as to enhance the natural beauty of the Gardens"".
On short leaves of absence he made collections of both living and herbarium specimens at Penang, Burma and neighbouring coastal areas. On some of the trips he was accompanied by Henry Nicholas Ridley, superintendent of The Singapore Botanic Gardens. Both men were interested in the development of the rubber industry, and experiments they made in Penang proved exceedingly valuable to planters.
Curtis' health began to deteriorate from 1890 onwards. He took leave of absence from Penang ""on account of ill-health"" from 26 January to 25 December 1891. Curtis blamed his ill-health on the quality and location of the accommodation made available to him. Returning in December 1891, Curtis spent another five months at the quarters ""during which the health of myself and family suffered severely from fever"" forcing him to vacate the house and rent accommodation elsewhere.
His 1892 "Annual Report" includes ""A list of the more important Plants and Trees flowered in the Botanic Gardens, Penang, 1892"", and provides an extensive review of the flowering species in the Gardens' collection. Two years later he published ""An Extensive Catalogue of Flowering Plants and Ferns Found Growing Wild in the island of Penang"" in the "Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society": containing 1,971 species of 793 genera and 129 natural orders, it is a significant record of Malaysian flora.
Curtis also maintained his professional association with the Veitch family during his tenure as Assistant Superintendent. Often forwarding specimens to their nursery, he always visited them while on leave in England, and James Herbert Veitch reported on the Gardens during a visit in 1896, as part of an extensive tour of inspection of South East Asian and Australasian botanic gardens and public gardens, in his ""Traveller's Notes"" (1896).
In March 1903, Curtis took early long service leave due to a ""complete breakdown in February"" from fever. Walter Fox was appointed Superintendent on 7 December 1903, ""the date of Mr Curtis's retirement"".
Following his appointment, Fox reflected that Curtis' administration was one of important developments in Penang:"In Curtis's retirement the Government loses an able conscientious and hardworking officer. It falls to the lot of few men on their retirement to leave their life's work in so visible and concrete a form. Eighteen years ago the site of the present beautiful Gardens was practically a waste ground. It is now the pride of the Colony and the admiration of all who visit it". Ridley recorded in 1910 that ""Mr Curtis was a man full of energy and skill as a landscape gardener and was not to be daunted by difficulties"".
Retirement.
Following his retirement, his main herbarium was transferred to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Curtis returned to England, settling in his native town of Barnstaple, in Devon, where he spent his retirement tending his own collection of peach trees, carnations, orchids, sweet peas, streptocarpus, and meconopsis in a garden close to Barnstaple Victoria Road railway station.
In the summer of 1928 he fell ill and in need of an operation in hospital. For a while it appeared as though he might make a full recovery, but five weeks after surgery, on 23 August, he died at his home at Barnstaple.

Before joining the Villanova faculty in 1976, he was an Assistant Professor of Law at Willamette University College of Law and an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Cincinnati, teaching under the name of Joseph Dellapannus. He has also held senior Fulbright lectureships at National Chengchi University in the Republic of China (Taiwan) (1978–79) and at Jilin University in the People’s Republic of China (1987–88), and was a Fulbright senior researcher with the Directory General of Natural Resources of the Republic of Portugal (1990), as well as visiting professor at Detroit College of Law, Widener University, and the Ohio State University. He is a regular visiting lecturer at the University of Macau and holds a three-year appointment as an Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of South Australia.
Water Law.
Dellapenna is best known for his work on water law, ranging from the local to the national to the international levels. In addition to teaching a course of his own design on Managing the Water Environment, he has served as a consultant to governments on three continents regarding water law reform and on transboundary water disputes. He has also taught related courses on Environmental Law, International Trade and the Environment, Natural Resources Law, and Ocean and Coastal Law. He represented the Connecticut Water Works Association in City of Waterbury v. Town of Washington, 260 Conn. 506, 802 A.2d 1102 (2002), persuading the Connecticut Supreme Court to adopt a significant reinterpretation of Connecticut water law. He is also a major contributor to Waters and Water Rights (LexisNexis: Newark, NJ, multiple ed., various dates) the standard treatise of the topic, being responsible nearly the whole of volumes 1 and 3 and parts of volumes 2, 5, and 6, of the eight volume treatise. He has also written articles and books on water law, most notably “The Importance of Getting Names Right: The Myth of Markets for Water,” William & Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review, vol. 2:317-77 (2000).
Dellapenna has been Director of the Model Water Code Project of the American Society of Civil Engineers since 1996 and served as Rapporteur of the Water Resources Committee of the International Law Association from 1996 to 2004. As Director of the Model Water Code Project, he led in the drafting of the Appropriative Rights Model Water Code and the Regulated Riparian Model Water Code, and supervised the preparation of Model Agreements for Sharing and Use of Transboundary Waters and Model Water Regulations for Administration and Trading in Humid Areas. As Rapporteur, he led the revision of the Helsinki Rules, the generally recognized summary of the customary international law on water resources, a revision that resulted in the International Law Association’s approval in August 2004 of the Berlin Rules on Water Resources to replace the Helsinki Rules. He has served as chair of the Water Regulatory Standards Committee of the Environment and Water Resources Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers since 1996 and as Vice-Chair of the Standards Development Council of the Institute since 2006. He also is co-chair of the Committee on International Environmental Law of the Section of International Law and Practice of the American Bar Association.
International and Comparative Law.
Dellapenna has taught and practiced extensively in the area of international and comparative law. Among the courses he has taught in this area are: Admiralty, Chinese Law, Comparative Law, Conflicts of Law (Private International Law), Law of the Sea, Public International Law, and Transnational Litigation, as well as the already mentioned courses on International Trade and the Environment and on Ocean and Coastal Law. He has represented clients, consulted with attorneys and governments, and served as an expert witness in litigation in the United States and other countries. He is particularly well known as an expert on foreign state immunity and works frequently on such cases. His book, "Suing Foreign Governments and Their Corporations" (1st ed., The Bureau of National Affairs: Washington, DC 1988; 2nd ed., Transnational Publishers: Ardsley, NY 2003) was described by one book reviewer as the "bible" for liti¬gation under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. The book was cited by both Justice David Souter (writing for the majority) and Justice John Paul Stevens (writing in dissent) in Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.S. 349 (1993), as well as in numerous lower courts, as authoritative for the interpretation of the Act. He has also written numerous other articles on the above topics.
Perhaps Dellapenna’s most noteworthy litigation was as co-counsel for the family of Raoul Wallenberg in a case brought by Wallenberg’s half-brother, Guy von Dardel. Von Dardel v. U.S.S.R., 623 F. Supp. 246 (D.D.C. 1985). Although the judgment subsequently was vacated, 736 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1990), the Soviet government then opened its records to the family regarding Wallenberg’s fate, resulting in a report jointly released by the Swedish and Russian governments in 2000 confirming Wallenberg’s murder in 1947. Dellapenna’s work on this case was recognized with his award of the Wallenberg medal by the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation in 2008. His work was also featured prominently in a book about Wallenberg and the efforts to secure his release: "Alan Gersten, A Conspiracy of Indifference: The Raoul Wallenberg Story" 200-82 (2001). 
Dellapenna chaired the Committee on International Litigation of the Section of International Law and Practice of the American Bar Association from 1993-1995 and the Section’s Committee on Chinese Law from 1995-1999. He was a member of the Working Group of the Section of International Law and Practice of the American Bar Association that drafted a proposed set of amendments to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that the Association’s House of Delegates approved in 2002.
"Other Fields of Law": Dellapenna has also taught several courses on contracts and commercial law and occasionally serves as an attorney in such cases. This includes more than 20 years in teaching basic contracts. He has also developed a special interest in the history of abortion and abortion law in England and America. This led to his book, "Dispelling the Myths of Abortion History" (Carolina Academic Press: 2006), a book that several reviewers has described as "definitive". He has also presented amicus briefs on the history of abortion in three cases before the Supreme Court of the United States and several lower courts.
Honors.
Dellapenna was awarded the Raoul Wallenberg Medal by the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation for his work on litigation seeking to determine what became of Wallenberg, a hero of the holocaust who disappeared after World War II. He has also been selected as a distinguished lecturer several times.

National Committee of the Republic of Estonia

The National Committee of the Republic of Estonia (, EVRK) was formed by the underground resistance movements in German-occupied Estonia in March 1944. By April 1944 a large number of the committee members were arrested by the German security agencies.
The original initiative to form the committee came from the Estonian pre-war opposition parties but it was quickly joined by Jüri Uluots, the last constitutional pre-war Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia and his supporters. The Committee aimed to establish of a provisional government during expected German withdrawal as the Red Army had reached the border of Estonia on February 2, 1944.
The Committee succeeded in establishing a communication network with the Estonian diplomats in Finland and Sweden.
On 20 April 1944, the National Committee selected the Electoral Committee of the Republic of Estonia ("Vabariigi Presidendi Asetäitja Valimiskogu", the institution specified in the Constitution for electing the Acting President of the Republic) held a clandestine meeting in Tallinn. The participants included: 
The Committee determined that the Soviet-era appointment of Johannes Vares as Prime Minister by Konstantin Päts had been illegal and that Uluots had assumed the President's duties from June 21, 1940 onwards. On 21 June 1944, Jüri Uluots appointed Otto Tief as deputy prime minister. On 18 September 1944, Uluots, suffering from cancer, named Otto Tief the Acting Prime Minister and appointed a Government which consisted of 11 members. On 20 September 1944, Uluots departed for Sweden. Tief assumed office in accordance with the constitution and took the opportunity with the departure of the Germans to declare the legitimate Estonian government restored. Most of members of this government left from Tallinn on 21 September and Tief on 22 September. As reported by the Royal Institute of International Affairs at the time: the Estonian national government was proclaimed in Estonia, the Estonian military units seized the national government buildings in Toompea Castle and ordered the German forces to leave. The flag of Germany was replaced with the flag of Estonia in the Pikk Hermann tower of Toompea. Tief’s government however failed to keep control as Estonian military units led by Johan Pitka clashed with both Germans and Soviets. On 22 September, the Soviet Leningrad Front took control of Tallinn. Most of the members and officials including Tief were caught, jailed, deported, or executed by the advancing Soviets. Tief managed to survive a decade in Siberia and after return from deportation died back in Estonia in 1976. Only Kaarel Liidak, Minister of Agriculture, died in hiding on 16 January 1945.
After Uluots died on January 9, 1945 in Sweden, August Rei, as the most senior surviving member of the government, assumed the role of acting head of state. Rei was supported by the surviving members of the Tief's government in Sweden. Rei was the last Estonian envoy in Moscow before the Soviet annexation and had managed to escape from Moscow through Riga to Stockholm in June 1940.
On 12 January 1953, the Estonian Government in Exile was established in Oslo, Norway.

George Sessions Perry

George Sessions Perry (May 5, 1910-December 13, 1956) was an American novelist, World War II correspondent and one of the highest paid popular magazine contributors of his time. He is remembered best for his 1941 novel "Hold Autumn in Your Hand", which won the National Book Award and the Texas Institute of Letters award in 1941. In 1945, famed French director Jean Renoir directed "The Southerner", based on "Hold Autumn in Your Hand", starring Zachary Scott and Beulah Bondi. The critical praise and comparisons to John Steinbeck established Perry as one of the top writers of his era.
Early days.
Born in Rockdale, Texas, he was the only son of Andrew Perry, a businessman who owned the local drug store, and Laura Perry, who set the social scene in Rockdale. After the death of his father in 1922 and the suicide of his mother a year later, George lived with his maternal grandmother Mai Van de Venter, whom he later immortalized in his book "My Granny Van", and his Uncle Perry. He spent a year at Southwestern University in nearby Georgetown, the first of three attempts at a college education that included stints at Southwestern, Purdue and the University of Houston, never earning a degree. At Southwestern he met Claire Hodges, daughter of a Beaumont medical doctor who rode out the devastating 1900 hurricane in Galveston, Texas.
Career.
In 1931 he returned from traveling abroad to marry her and move back to Rockdale. Insulated from the worst effects of the Great Depression by a small inherited income, Perry spent the next six years writing six novels and more than fifty short stories about rural and small-town Texas and the semifeudal system of tenant farming that prevailed at the time. Claire Perry acted as his typist, grammarian, and audience. Finally, in 1937, "The Saturday Evening Post" published one of his stories, and soon thereafter Doubleday published his first book, "Walls Rise Up", a comic novel about three vagrants living along the Brazos River. In 1941 Perry firmly established his place on the Texas literary scene with "Hold Autumn in Your Hand", a novel about a year in the life of a tenant farmer, perhaps the best agrarian novel about Texas. The book won the Texas Institute of Letters "Book of the Year" award in 1941 and became the first Texas book to win the National Book Award. That was the Bookseller Discovery of 1941, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. According to "The New York Times", the Discovery was "a sort of consolation prize that the booksellers hope will draw attention to his work"; 7000 copies had been sold.
George and Claire Perry acquired a second home in Guilford, Connecticut in the late 1940s. He became one of the most popular writers in the nation in the postwar period as a correspondent for "The Saturday Evening Post", particularly with the series "Cities of America" and "Families of America." To the consternation of many of his fans and literary critics, however, he never returned to novels. In declining physical and mental health in his later years, he disappeared on December 13, 1956 after walking into a river near his home there; his body was recovered some days later and a coroner's inquest ruled accidental drowning.

<doc id="20091953" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20091953" title="Bruce McDonald (judge)">
Bruce McDonald (judge)

Bruce P. McDonald (died May 10, 2005) was a provincial court judge in Manitoba, Canada. He resigned in 1993, following controversy about racist and sexist statements he had made from the bench.
Early career.
McDonald became a judge in Portage la Prairie in 1962. He was criticized in 1987 for issuing only a $500 fine in a drunk driving case that resulted in a man's death. By the 1990s, he was one of the last small-town resident judges in the province.
Controversy.
Three of McDonald's rulings in 1992-93 attracted widespread attention and condemnation. In August 1992, he declined a request for assistance from a woman who worked in the same office as her ex-boyfriend, whom she accused of harassment. McDonald was quoted as saying, "Ever thought of quitting work?". A few months later, the "Winnipeg Free Press" reported that McDonald declined a woman's request for a peace bond, and told her to "work something out" with the man she accused of assaulting her. The woman, a resident of the Sandy Bay Indian Reserve, said that she was humiliated by the experience, and that McDonald's comments made it seem as though she was at fault. Advocates for abused women said the incident made a mockery of Manitoba's zero tolerance rules against domestic violence.
In April 1993, McDonald ruled that a 73-year old man who pled guilty to sexual assault against four of his relatives was motivated by "curiosity", and sentenced him to two years' probation. In response, several critics argued that McDonald was insensitive to issues of abuse. Ann McGillvray of the University of Manitoba said that his approach was "40 years out of date" and that he stood out "like a sore thumb" in Manitoba's judicial system. Provincial Justice Minister James McCrae announced a review into McDonald's sentence, and ordered the Manitoba Judicial Council to launch a broader review into McDonald's activities. McCrae also announced that he would overhaul the Judicial Council and introduce provincial legislation to ensure the better screening of judicial applicants. In June 1993, the appeals court overturned and denounced McDonald's ruling, and issued a six month jail term against the defendant.
Further investigative reporting by the "Winnipeg Free Press" revealed that McDonald was known in the legal community for granting discharges in sexual assault cases. He frequently berated Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers for minor technical errors, and kept personal records on accused persons who appeared before him. Several lawyers refused to criticize him on the record, fearing repercussions if they appeared again in his courtroom.
McDonald was suspended on May 11, 1993, after chief provincial judge Kris Stefanson reviewed a transcript of remarks that he made in a December 1969 court hearing. During this case, McDonald said he was "distressed" that residents of the Long Plains Indian Band had refused to cooperate with the RCMP, and expressed "hope" that they would not receive RCMP help if they ever needed it. He then added, "joyful result would be that the residents of the reserve would kill one another off". In the same transcript, McDonald said, "I am well aware of the fact that there is more violence on Indian reserves than anywhere else in the country. I am well aware of the fact that when an Indian [... fights, (he) doesn't fight, he tries to massacre somebody. The amount of damage inflicted on various complainants is considerable, and if it weren't for the fact that most of them have the thickest skulls in the country, there would be many more possibilities of murder charges that would be incapable of being proved because all the witnesses hadn't seen anything." These remarks were widely condemned, with Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs leader Phil Fontaine saying that he was outraged by McDonald's behaviour.
As the scandal unfolded, it was reported that several complaints had been filed against McDonald in the previous decades. A transcript of McDonald's remarks was reportedly sent to chief provincial judge Harold Gyles after the 1969 case, although Gyles said that he never received the document. In 1978, Crown Attorney Bob Maxwell submitted a complaint alleging that McDonald showed bias against aboriginal Canadians, made derogatory remarks made from the bench, and was generally rude and unprofessional in his behaviour. Portions of this complaint were submitted to provincial Attorney-General Gerald Mercier and later forwarded to Gyles, who reprimanded McDonald in private and requested that he give up control of the docket to the Crown. McDonald complied, and a senior official in the Attorney-General's department described the matter as resolved. During this period, Gyles also told Mercier that a public inquiry would cause adverse publicity. Gyles later said that he did not investigate other complaints against McDonald during this period because they were not made in writing. Gord Mackintosh, opposition critic for the New Democratic Party, said that this explanation was not acceptable.
In 1987, the Manitoba Advisory Council on the Status of Women filed a complaint to Attorney-General Roland Penner about McDonald's handling of sexual assault cases. Penner referred MACSW to the Manitoba Judicial Council. Gyles, who served on the council, investigated the matter and sent McDonald a letter of admonition. Several complaints about McDonald were later submitted between 1988 and 1993.
Aftermath.
McDonald resigned in December 1993, just as the Judicial Council was about to begin an investigation into his activities. His resignation caused the immediate cancellation of the hearings. Rosemary Vodrey, who succeeded McCrae as Justice Minister, subsequently rejected requests for an independent inquiry. In 1994, she announced a policy change allowing judicial inquiries to continue after a judge's retirement, if it is in the public interest.
Ruth Teichrob won a Manitoba Human Rights Award in late 1993 for her coverage of the McDonald controversy.
McDonald died on May 10, 2005, at age 86.

Ratchawithi Road

Ratchawithi Road, also spelled Rajvithi (, ) is a major road in Bangkok, Thailand. It begins in Ratchathewi district at Sam Liam Din Daeng Junction, where it intersects with Din Daeng Road and Ratchaprarop Road, and runs northwest, past Victory Monument Circle, through Dusit district, and ultimately crossing the Chao Phraya River on Krung Thon Bridge and ending in Bang Phlat district at Bang Phlat Intersection, where it intersects with Sirindhorn Road and Charan Sanitwong Road.
Ratchawithi Road was formerly known as Sang Hi Road (). It was originally constructed during the reign of King Chulalongkorn, as one of three new roads constructed at the time Dusit Palace was built, along with Lok Road (, now Rama V Road) and Duang Tawan Road (, now Si Ayutthaya Road). The name "Sang Hi" comes from Chinese, and means "exceedingly happy".
The original road stretched only from behind Dusit Palace to the edge of the Chao Phraya. It was later expanded to connect to Ratchaprarop Road, and then extended across the river to Charan Sanitwong Road when the Krung Thon Bridge began construction in 1954. Because it connected the two sections of the former Sang Hi Road on either side of the river, the Krung Thong Bridge has been called by locals Sang Hi Bridge (, "Saphan Sang Hi") since before it was officially christened. The intersection of Ratchawithi and Samsen roads, the final intersection before crossing the bridge on the east side of the river, is named Sang Hi Intersection.

Following (solitaire)

Following is a solitaire card game which uses a deck of playing cards. It is so called because a player has to follow a rotation of suits. It was first described in the book "Games of Patience" by M. Whitemore Jones and has since seen in the book "Games for One" and at least two computer solitaire packages.
At the onset, one has to lay six cards in a row; this will compose the tableau. Like any solitaire game, the object is to remove the aces and build them up to kings. The catch of this game is the rotation of suits that the player must remember: A Club must be placed over a Heart, a Diamond over a Club, a Spade on a Diamond, and a Heart on a Spade. This rule applies to both the foundations and the tableau.
Building on the tableau is down, provided that the rotation of suits described above is followed. An entire sequence in any length can be moved, again retaining the rotation of suits. When the cards in the tableau are not sufficient for building, the stock is dealt one card at a time onto a wastepile. The top card of the wastepile can be used to build on the tableau and the foundations. Once the stock is used up, the wastepile is picked up to become the new stock. This can be done only once in the game. Also, spaces in the tableau can be filled up with any card, whether it is from one of the cards already in the tableau, the top card of the wastepile, or the next card from the stock.
The game ends soon after the stock runs out the second time. The game is won when all cards are built into the foundations, with the King of a foundation pile being the same suit as the Ace that started the pile.

Stephen Switzer

Stephen Switzer (1682–1745) was a garden designer and writer on garden subjects, an early exponent of the English landscape garden who admired and emulated the formal grandeur of French broad prospects and woodland avenues, finding in the state of horticulture an index of cultural health, in Augustan Rome as in contemporary Britain, where "August Designs example is Blenheim Palace denote that Greatness of Mind that reigns in the English "Nobility" and "Gentry"". His landscape design principles parallel those expressed in Alexander Pope's "Epistle to Lord Burlington" and the views on "natural" gardening expressed in essays by Joseph Addison.
Switzer received sufficient early training in Hampshire to be taken on as a garden boy working for George London and Henry Wise in their Brompton nursery, in Kensington, now part of London. Switzer helped execute London's designs at Castle Howard, Yorkshire (from 1706), notably the "wilderness", at Cirencester Park, Gloucestershire (from about 1713), and at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire. Switzer also designed the garden at Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire (about 1716).
In 1715 Stephen Switzer published a work on "Forest, or Rural Gardening", "The Nobleman, Gentleman, and Gardener's Recreation", which he expanded to form his "Ichnographia" (1718; lightly revised and enlarged with two further essays as "Ichnographia Rustica" 1741-42). He also published "The Practical Husbandman and Planter" (1733) and "An Introduction to a General System of Hydrostaticks and Hydraulicks" (1729). 
Stephen Switzer included the first lengthy historical sketch of the progress of gardening in England in "The Nobleman, Gentleman, and Gardener's Recreation" was vocal in the criticism of topiary and the formality of the "Dutch Garden" and introduced the term "ferme ornée", the "ornamental farm" integrating the ‘useful’ and ‘profitable’ aspects of kitchen gardening and animal husbandry with apparently artless beautiful and charming views and details.
His main rival in the practical, though not the literary, aspects of early tentative exercises in "naturalistic" planting schemes was Charles Bridgeman.

Mainly associated with Cambridge University Cricket Club, he made 18 known appearances in first-class matches and had three brothers who all played first-class cricket.
Career.
Kirwan, a right arm fast roundarm bowler, was known as "Wacky". He "bowled jerkily with a low arm, but at a very fast pace". He made his name as a schoolboy player at Eton College, his outstanding performance being to take all ten MCC wickets (all bowled) in 1835. He took a total of 26 wickets in just two matches for Eton that season. He went up to King's College, Cambridge in the same year, and played for the University team thereafter, his cricket career ending when he finally left Cambridge in 1842 to become a curate at St Feock in Cornwall.
Kirwan had an outstanding first-class debut in May 1836 when he played for the university versus Cambridge Town Club at Parker's Piece and took 15 wickets (all bowled) with six in the first innings and nine in the second.
Kirwan's overall first-class career record was 108 wickets (i.e., bowled only) in just 18 matches, a very high rate of six wickets per game. His 9 wickets on debut was his best single performance. He took 5 wickets in an innings 11 times and 10 wickets in a match 3 times. He was less successful as a right-handed batsman, scoring just 293 runs with a highest of 41. He is credited with only 3 catches and so was almost certainly an outfielder.

Small penis rule

The "small penis rule" is an informal strategy used by authors to evade libel lawsuits. It was described in a "New York Times" article in 1998:
"...For a fictional portrait to be actionable, it must be so accurate that a reader of the book would have no problem linking the two," said Mr. Friedman. Thus, he continued, libel lawyers have what is known as 'the small penis rule.' One way authors can protect themselves from libel suits is to say that a character has a small penis, Mr. Friedman said. "Now no male is going to come forward and say, 'That character with a very small penis, that's me!' "
The small penis rule was referenced in a 2006 dispute between Michael Crowley and Michael Crichton. Crowley alleged that after he wrote an unflattering review of Crichton's novel "State of Fear", Crichton libeled him by including a character named "Mick Crowley" in the novel "Next". In the novel, Mick Crowley is a child rapist, described as being a Washington-based journalist and Yale graduate with a small penis.

Electoral districts of Lower Canada

The electoral districts of Lower Canada were territorial subdivisions of the British North American Province of Lower Canada serving as the basis of the representation of the population in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, the lower house of the Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada. This house was the first legislative assembly in the history of Quebec. The districts were used between 1792 and 1838, date at which the constitution of the country was suspended as a consequence of the Rebellions of 1837.
The Constitutional Act of 1791 provided for the creation of a House of Assembly or Legislative Assembly, made up of at least 50 elected members. Lieutenant governor Alured Clarke divided the territory of the province into 27 districts each returning one or two Members to the Provincial Parliament. 23 districts were returning two MPPs and 4 were returning a single one. The rural districts were called counties (French: "comtés"), while the urban ones were called cities ("cités") or bouroughs ("bourgs"). 16 out of 27, bore typically English names, while the others bore French or Amerindian names.
In 1828, governor James Kempt, who was in good terms with the elected House of Assembly, favoured the redrawing of the electoral map: five new districts were created, in total electing 8 new MPPs, in the newly settled Eastern Townships. These elected their first representatives to Parliament in 1829. The following year, the old districts were subdivided into smaller ones, which for the most part were given French names. A last district was created in 1832 and a second seat was added to existing ones, so that when the constitution was suspended in 1838, there were 46 electoral districts in Lower Canada and they were returning 90 MPPs in total. 29 of these bore French names, 11 Amerindian names and 6 English names.

Agnes Blannbekin

Agnes Blannbekin ( or ; c. 1244 – March 10, 1315), was an Austrian Beguine and Christian mystic. She was also referred to as "Saint Agnes Blannbekin" or the "Venerable Agnes Blannbekin", though never beatified or canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. Her controversial revelations were compiled by her confessor Ermenrich and later published in 1731 as "Venerabilis Agnetis Blannbekin". The copies were confiscated by the Society of Jesus, and only two manuscripts survived. One was destroyed in a fire at the Straßburg library in 1870. The surviving manuscript, currently owned by a Cistercian convent in Zwettl, Austria, was not released until the 20th century. Although Blannbekin is best remembered today for her visions, during her life she was known for her ministry to the urban population.
Life.
Blannbekin was born in Plambach, Austria to a peasant family. Her surname, which is also sometimes spelled Blanbakin, comes from the name of this village (i.e., "Plambachen"). At the age of seven or eight, Blannbekin began secretly giving her meals to the poor. By the age of ten or eleven, she began craving the sacramental bread. In around 1260, she joined the Third Order of Saint Francis in Vienna; for the rest of her life she refused to eat meat, claiming the body of Christ was enough meat for her.
During services and prayers Blannbekin began to hear voices which explained spiritual mysteries. Her visions were transcribed by the Franciscan monk Ermenrich, her confessor. Although not all of her revelations were considered obscene, they included visions of monks, woman, and Jesus naked. In one vision, she claimed to have felt the foreskin of Jesus in her mouth:
Crying and with compassion, she began to think about the foreskin of Christ, where it may be located the Resurrection. And behold, soon she felt with the greatest sweetness on her tongue a little piece of skin alike the skin in an egg, which she swallowed. After she had swallowed it, she again felt the little skin on her tongue with sweetness as before, and again she swallowed it. And this happened to her about a hundred times. And when she felt it so frequently, she was tempted to touch it with her finger. And when she wanted to do so, that little skin went down her throat on its own. And it was told to her that the foreskin was resurrected with the Lord on the day of resurrection. And so great was the sweetness of tasting that little skin that she felt in all limbs and parts of the limbs a sweet transformation.
Blannbekin described herself as continually beset with visions throughout the day, which she described as "imber lacrimarum", or a "rain of tears" from God. Many of these visions involved bright lights, and in one she described being "so filled with light within that she could gaze at herself." As with the foreskin occasion, many of her visions involved touch, such as being kissed on the cheeks by the Lamb of God. While eating the Eucharist, Blannbekin claimed to taste Christ; on one occasion, a sexually immoral priest could not find his Eucharist, which Blannbekin claimed to have felt in her own mouth. Similarly, she described drinking a "refreshing spiritual drink" from the spear wound of Jesus. Supposed visitations from Jesus himself caused an orgastic reaction: "Agnes herself was filled with an excitement in her chest every time that God visited her that was so intense that it went through her body and that it burned as a result, not in a painful but in a most pleasurable manner."
Blannbekin died in Vienna, Austria on March 1, 1315 in her convent.

Tobacco (musician)

Thomas Fec, better known by his stage name Tobacco, is an American electronic musician. He is the frontman of the band Black Moth Super Rainbow, in addition to working as a solo artist; in both settings he works most conspicuously with pre-digital electronic instruments such as analog synthesizers and tape machines.
History.
Little is known about Tobacco, as he, along with the rest of Black Moth Super Rainbow, is very private and rarely does interviews. It is known that Tobacco grew up in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Hampton High School in 1998 along with bandmate Seth Ciotti. In a 2009 interview with "Skyscraper Magazine", Tobacco said that his name derived from "a character that freaked me out as a kid, the Tobacco Man," referring to the character from the film "Redneck Zombies".
Tobacco released his first solo album, "Fucked Up Friends", on Anticon on October 14, 2008. It was recorded using entirely analog equipment. "Rolling Stone" said of the album, "one of the year's best stoner-rock records - only it's powered by synths, hip-hop beats and vocoders instead of guitars." "Exclaim!" called it "worthy of obsessive listening." The album featured a guest appearance from Aesop Rock. A DVD of the album had been released more than a year prior, on September 3, 2007, by The 70's Gymnastics Recording Company.
In February 2010, an e-mail sent out to the Black Moth Super Rainbow/Tobacco e-mail list announced a new CD by Tobacco entitled "Maniac Meat" that would feature Beck on two tracks titled "Fresh Hex" and "Grape Aerosmith." Tobacco revealed that in making the album, the two exchanged parts for songs via e-mail, and that they had never actually met in person. On March 30, 2010, the website "Pitchfork Media" released the first song from "Maniac Meat" titled "Sweatmother". The album came out on May 25 on Anticon.
"LA UTI" was released on November 9, 2010 on Anticon as a companion piece to "Maniac Meat". The EP features underground rappers such as Doseone, Rob Sonic, Serengeti among others.
Tobacco produced the track "Glass Coffins" from Antipop Consortium rapper Beans' solo album "End It All" in 2011.
In February 2012 it was announced that Tobacco and Zackey Force Funk were teaming up to release an album under the band name Demon Queen. Since then a couple tracks have been leaked by the artists to soundcloud and a Facebook page has been created.
Style.
In an interview with "Kotori Magazine" in September 2008, Tobacco explained the difference between Black Moth Super Rainbow and Tobacco: "Mostly everything I've done with BMSR is made to be pop. And of people say BMSR is bordering on hip-hop beats. So with Tobacco, I wanted to embrace my beats and get darker and sleeker with it all. I want to make you feel paranoid in a good way. There’s something seriously fucked about workout tapes from the mid 80s, and just about everything obscure on beta tape. They make me feel awful, but really good and curious at the same time. With this Tobacco stuff, I’m trying to translate that feeling." 
Tobacco's live shows mainly consist of him and BMSR bandmate The Seven Fields of Aphelion, and an unnamed person from Portland, Oregon playing along with video projections from "Fucked Up Friends" and "Fucked Up Friends 2".

Take My Word For It (Traditional Chinese: 談判專家) is a 30-episode TVB drama broadcast between November 2002 and December 2002. 
Synopsis.
The story follows the lead characters through their experiences as members of the Police Negotiation Cadre (PNC). The PNC is a volunteer unit of the Hong Kong police force specializing in negotiations with terrorist members, partakers of local violence, and individuals contemplating suicide. The whole series is dotted with both large and small cases handled by the story's heroes and heroines.
There is a love square between Pang Kwok-Tung (Bobby Au-Yeung), Kan Kit (Kenix Kwok), Mok Ka-Chung (Moses Chan) and Poon Man-Ching (Winnie Yeung). Bobby Au-Yeung later finds out that Winnie is cheating on him and secretly meeting Moses, Kenix Kwok's husband. Moses and Winnie leave Hong Kong, however, Moses returns to Hong Kong with the news that Winnie has once again separated from her husband and found another man. Yeung Kwong and Ip Ho-Yan have a comical love relationship, and marry in the end. Eventually, Bobby and Kenix get together. Many problems also happen in Yeung Kwong's (Julian Cheung) family. He is not his father's biological son (although he is favoured over his three siblings). Ip Ho-Yan (Annie Man) has a brief relationship with Julian Cheung's brother, Yeung Hau-Mo (Ellesmere Choi), but it ends when Ellesmere Choi cannot forget his previous girlfriend. Ip Ho-Yan and Julian Cheung start off as beginners learning about PNC. Towards the end, they become professional members of the PNC, and even stop their own instructor, Pang Kwok-Tung (Bobby Au-Yeung) from committing suicide.

<doc id="20092561" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20092561" title="Steel wire armoured cable">
Steel wire armoured cable

Steel wire armoured cable, commonly abbreviated as SWA, is a hard-wearing power cable designed for the supply of mains electricity. It is one of a number of armoured electrical cables – which include 11kV Cable and 33kV Cable – and is found in underground systems, power networks and cable ducting.
The typical construction of an SWA cable can be broken down as follows:
The PVC version of SWA cable, described above, meets the requirements of both British Standard BS5467 and International Electrotechnical Commission standard IEC 60502. It is known as SWA BS5467 Cable and it has a voltage rating of 600/1000V.
SWA cable can be referred to more generally as mains cable, armoured cable, power cable and booklet armoured cable. The name power cable, however, applies to a wide range of cables including 6381Y, NYCY, NYY-J and 6491X Cable. 
Aluminium wire armoured cable.
Steel wire armour is only used on multicore versions of the cable. A multicore cable, as the name suggests, is one where there are a number of different cores. When cable has only one core, aluminium wire armour (AWA) is used instead of steel wire. This is because the aluminium is non-magnetic. A magnetic field is produced by the current in a single core cable. This would induce an electric current in the steel wire, which could cause overheating.
Use of armour for earthing.
The use of the armour as the means of providing earthing to the equipment supplied by the cable (a function technically known as the circuit protective conductor or CPC) is a matter of debate within the electrical installation industry. It is sometimes the case that an additional core within the cable is specified as the CPC (for instance, instead of using a two core cable for line and neutral and the armouring as the CPC, a three core cable is used) or an external earth wire is run alongside the cable to serve as the CPC. Primary concerns are the relative conductivity of the armouring compared to the cores (which reduces as the cable size increases) and reliability issues. Recent articles by authoritative sources have analysed the practice in detail and concluded that, for the majority of situations, the armouring is adequate to serve as the CPC under UK wiring regulations.
SWA BS6724 cable.
The construction of an SWA cable, however, does depend on the intended use of the cable. When the power cable needs to be installed in a public area, for example, a Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH) equivalent, called SWA BS6724 Cable must be used. After the King’s Cross fire in London in 1987 it became mandatory to use LSZH sheathing on all London Underground cables – a number of the fatalities were due to toxic gas and smoke inhalation. As a result, LSZH cables are now recommended for use in highly populated enclosed public areas. This is because they emit non-toxic levels of Halogen and low levels of smoke when exposed to fire. SWA Cable BS6724 – which meets the requirements of British standard BS6724 – has LSZH bedding and a black LSZH sheath.

Stigliano (Sovicille)

Stigliano is a village in Tuscany, Italy, a frazione of the "comune" of Sovicille, in the province of Siena.
History.
Ancient era.
As showed by excavations of ruins of "castellieri" (walls protecting ancient settlements), the origins of Stigliano date to Iron Age times. Scholars have suggested that these structures could have been built by the Etruscans as a defense against the invasion of the Senones. Presence of the latter is confirmed by local toponyms, such as the name of the village Brenna, close to Stigliano, which could stem from the name of their leader Brennus. The name of the local Merse river, which flows behind Stigliano, is potentially directly related to Merseburg, a town in eastern Germany.
Although very little is known of Stigliano during the Roman times, the name of "Sextilianum" which appears in later records, may show the existence of the town at the time.
Middle Ages.
Stigliano is the site for one of the many castles that were part of the "Ardenghesca "consortium.
In the 14th century, Stigliano was the hub of a network of roads crossing the region, one to Massa Marittima and another following the Rosia river to the Maremma. All routes passed through the village of Torri and Stigliano; traces of the old roads can be seen in the woods nearby Stigliano.
The presence of a monastery at Torri triggered economic growth in the area. The monks carried out an agricultural and industrial revolution, draining the marshes and introducing water mills along the Merse. 
An abundance of water and natural source of energy influenced the development of Stigliano and the neighbouring villages during the 13th century. This was of particular importance for Siena, the major city in the area, which had no rivers or natural resources of its own. The first established industry was that of the Wool Masters “The Follatura”, who signed a contract with the monks at Torri to develop the natural springs into a series of aqueducts, one of which still serves the "comune" at Sovicille. The straight dirt track which goes to San Rocco a Pilli was also built at this time.
The river was also diverted to create room for construction of two large mills, “Sassa” and “Volta”. These mills were indispensable for the production of flour to supply Siena. This intricate mediaeval hydraulic system stretched for kilometers and was one of the most important technical achievements of the Middle Ages in Tuscany.
During this era, Stigliano was an independent commune, owning large areas of woodland and granting permits for allotments to its inhabitants, not only to farmers but also commercial entrepreneurs and merchants. There are documents recording deals of land exchanges with the Sienese as far back at the 13th century. However, after the outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 and the subsequent decline of the population, these achievements were neglected and even the revival of agriculture in the 18th century could not compare with the thriving centre in mediaeval times. The plague and the subsequent appearance of the ruthless condottieri armies which plundered of the countryside, ruined the synergy between the commune and its lands.

Tom Savage (painter)

Tom Savage (born November 28, 1953) is a contemporary American painter based in California whose work appears in museum collections and has been exhibited in major cities throughout the United States. His abstract paintings and drawings take a historical cue from post-war European automatism and surrealism, and the influence those movements had on abstract expressionism.
Critical debate.
The primal, unconscious and disharmonious nature of Savage's technique, which the artist himself has described as the antithesis of that of regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton, has proven an interpretive challenge for critics. 
In his "Los Angeles Times" review of Savage's 1995 solo exhibition at the Cirrus Gallery in Los Angeles, critic David Pagel described the artist's works as "raw, incoherent, precarious and daring. At the same time, they're confident and desperate, riddled with deep doubts but also profoundly self-assured."
Writing of the same show in the national West Coast contemporary art review "Artweek", critic Peter Kosenko characterized Savage's paintings as "abstract and generally impressionistic, but they nonetheless resist placement within the traditions of abstract expressionism as codified by formalist criticism, for they display little of the angst-ridden struggle with paint or the preoccupation with the sublime that often characterize the strategies of the genre."
Critic David DiMichele of the "Los Angeles Downtown News", noting Savage's use of unprimed canvas and "thinly applied traceries," wrote that the artist's style is "marked by a pronounced sense of restraint... Emphatically abstract, his work seeks to preserve something of the initial excitement that occurs when an artist first puts brush to canvas."
Revisiting Savage's work at the August 1996 exhibition "Transcendental Meditations" at the William Turner Gallery in Venice, California, Los Angeles Times critic David Pagel observed that the artist's "inarticulate markings, crudely painted and scrawled on raw canvas, share more with children's drawings than with any desire to leave this world behind."

Battenberg course indicator

The Battenberg course indicator is a mechanical calculating device invented by Prince Louis of Battenberg in 1892 for taking station on other vessels whose range & bearing and course & speed are known. By extension, it has a range of other functions related to relative velocity calculations. A number of versions of the device were produced and it proved particularly useful for station-keeping, such as ships moving in convoy during World War II. Manufacture of the instruments was contracted to Elliott Brothers, London. Devices based on the Battenberg indicator were also developed for determining course and distance in aviation and when making allowances for aircraft drift due to winds. Instruments were also manufactured for other navies, for example in the USA. 
Mark I.
Prince Louis of Battenberg employed a firm of London instrument makers to build a prototype to his design. The device comprised:
To use the instrument, the course of the flagship was first set on the guide bar. When the initial and final stations had been set using the position bars, the speed ratio clamp was set to show the ratio of own ship speed to the speed of the flagship (if the flagship was doing 10 knots, and the manoeuvring ship had 15 knots available, the clamp would be set to "1.5"). Ensuring that the pin beneath the speed ratio clamp was set within the diameter grove, the course required to take station could then be read off the circular disc.
Mark II.
The Mark II version dispensed with the use of relative speeds and set the guide bar on a sliding speed scale, thus allowing the speed of the guide and the speed of the own ship to be set independently. The device was constructed largely of brass.
Mark III.
The Mark III instrument was constructed of aluminium alloy.
Mark IV.
Similar to Mark III. The circular scale attached to the end of the 'own ship' bar was moved to be part of the pivot assembly, so that it is fixed relative to the 'guide bar' instead of being fixed relative to the 'own ship' bar. The 'own ship' bar was redesigned with a pointer on the end to read off the scale.
Mark V.
The mark V instrument dispensed with the guide bar and own ship's bar, retaining only the two position bars. However the circular base plate was added to by the provision of two celluloid transparent discs which were placed on top of the base and free to rotate. The instrument body was made in an aluminium alloy, and had a scale graded in degrees around the outside. The base plate had no scale, but a series of interrupted parallel lines running across it. This device was in production around 1955.
One disc was marked with a scale from 0 at the centre to 36 on the outside, in a similar manner to the markings originally etched onto the base plate, except that three marked scales were used, one in a line through the centre and another parallel but half way to the edge either side of the centre line. The markings were then repeated by a second set at right angles to the first. Depending on usage, the marked scale numbers could refer to distance or speed.
A second disc was marked with a circular scale all around the edge labelled in degrees, with radial lines from the centre of the disc stretching out every ten degrees. The disc also had concentric circles which coincided with the marked scale on the other disc. To aid clarity, markings on the second disc were in a different colour to those on the first. 
The rear of the device had a separate rotating calculator, where if the ships speed was set against the 60-minute guide mark, then the distance travelled in any time 0–60 minutes could be read off against the logarithmic time scale.

Herbert Bunston

Herbert Bunston (15 April 1874 – 27 February 1935) was a British stage and screen actor. He is probably best remembered for his role as Dr. John Seward in the Broadway and film versions of "Dracula".
Bunston was born in Dorset, and attended Cranleigh School in Surrey. He appeared on the British stage between 1896 and 1922, after which he emigrated to the United States. He first appeared on the Broadway stage in Arthur Wing Pinero's "The Enchanted Cottage" in 1923 alongside Katharine Cornell. Other roles included "That Awful Mrs. Eaton!" and "Simon Called Peter" in 1925. None of these plays ran as many as 100 performances. Bunston won strong critical notice for his next role in 1925's "Young Woodley", which ran for 260 performances. On 5 October 1927, he debuted alongside Bela Lugosi and Edward Van Sloan in "Dracula".
Following his success in these last two plays, he signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Following a number of roles of greater and lesser significance, Bunston was cast to re-create his Broadway role in the film adaptation of "Dracula" (1931). Bunston continued to appear in character roles for the next four years until his death in Los Angeles in 1935.

Technical data management system

A Technical Data Management System (TDMS) is essentially a Document management system (DMS) pertaining to the management of technical and engineering drawings and documents. Often the data are contained in 'records' of various forms, such on paper, microfilms or on digital media. Hence technical data management is also concerned with record management involving purely technical or techno-commercial or techno-legal information or data. Proper Technical Document Management Systems are essential for the smooth and trouble-free management of large organisations which are built around large scale projects involving engineering. For example, TDMS is a vital function for the successful management of Integrated Steel Plants (ISP), Automobile factories, Aero-space facilities, Infrastructure companies, City Corporations, Research Organisations, etc. In such organisations, Technical Archives or Technical Documentation Centres are created as central facilities, for the effective management of technical data and records.
TDMS functions are conceptually similar to that of conventional archive functions, except that the archived material in this case are essentially engineering drawings, survey maps, technical specifications, plant and equipment data sheets, feasibility reports, project reports, operation and maintenance manuals, standards, etc.
Document registration, indexing, repository management, reprography, etc. are part of TDMS. Various computer software systems are now available in this field. Various kinds of sophisticated reprography equipment, such as document scanners, microfilming and digitization camera units, wide format printers, digital plotters, etc. are available now which make the TDMS functions concered with reprography much easier than a few decades ago.
In some countries, such as in the US, record and document management are considered very vital functions, and much stress is given in the management of Technical Archives. Records and documents coming under the public domain are governed by appropriate laws. However, this has not been so in many underdeveloped and developing nations. For example, India enacted the ' Public Records Act' in 1993. However, many in this country are not aware of the existence of such a law or its importance.

Haifeng dialect

Haifeng dialect, Lufeng dialect or Hailufeng dialect is a dialect mostly spoken in Shanwei, Haifeng and Lufeng in Guangdong, China. It is a sub-dialect of Min Nan Chinese, and sometimes a sub-dialect of Teochew dialect. Since some of the characters pronunciations in Haifeng dialect are different from that in Teochew dialect (due to different rhymes in both dialects), Haifeng dialect is sometimes considered to be independent of Teochew dialect.

SS Westfalen (1905)

SS "Westfalen" was a German ship launched on 14 November 1905 at J.C. Tecklenborg in Geestemünde. 
In the early 1930s "Westfalen" was converted into a seaplane tender to serve as both weather reporting and refueling station for Dornier Wal flying boats of Lufthansa carrying mail trans-Atlantic between Europe and South America. The conversion of the "Westfalen" consisted of a large retractable stern mounted canvas drag apron for the flying boat to taxi on (i.e. for use in heavy seas and so the ship does not have to come to dead stop), cranes to lift the flying boats out the water to be refueled and serviced, and a large compressed air catapult for launching the aircraft heavy with fuel back into the air. When in operation, "Westfalen" cruised 900 miles in the middle of the South Atlantic between Bathhurst, Gambia (now Banjul) and Pernambuco, Brazil. First test trans-Atlantic flights by Lufthansa Wals began in 1933 and the first commercial mail flights in 1934.
World War II.
During World War II, the ship was used for transport between Germany and German-occupied Norway. On 7 September 1944 the ship sank off Marstrand, after hitting a naval mine. Seventy-eight people aboard survived, but most of the locked-up Norwegian prisoners-of-war were casualties, including Petter Moen, Reidar Olaf Østlid and Sverre Lid. SS-Sturmscharführer Wilhelm Heinze also died.

Warrington Phillip

Warrington Dexter Phillip (born 23 July 1968 in Nevis) is a former West Indian first-class cricketer. He represented the Leeward Islands cricket team regularly in the Red Stripe Cup during the 1990s and played for the his home island of Nevis in the inaugural Stanford 20/20, held in 2006, where they were surprise Semi Finalists.
Cricket career.
Phillip took part in the Leeward's winning Red Stripe Cup campaigns of 1993/94 and 1995/96. He played a big part in the 1995/96 Cup Final against Trinidad and Tobago by taking three wickets in the fourth innings which helped his team to win by 73 runs.
Perhaps the biggest scalp of his career was Aravinda de Silva, whom he dismissed when the Leeward Islands took on the touring Sri Lankans at St John's in 1997. He has also taken the wicket of Trinidadian Brian Lara, bowling him in a Red Stripe match which the Leeward Islands won.
His best performance in a match came during the 1994/95 Red Stripe Cup when he was Man of the Match after taking match figures of 13 for 123 against Jamaica. Eight of those wickets came in the first innings, at the expense of 92 runs and he took the other five when Jamaica followed on. At the time of his last first-class appearance, only Andy Roberts has taken better match and innings bowling analysis for the Leeward Islands than Phillip. It was a good season for Phillip, with his tally of 28 wickets at 15.50 only bettered in 1996/97 when he took 35 wickets, but at a more expensive average of 29.25.
Wife's murder.
On 16 February 2006 in Nevis, Phillip's wife Shermel was found dead in the back of her car. The throat of his wife of four years had been slashed and Phillip was arrested and charged by police. On 15 November 2008, a jury in Charlestown found Phillip guilty of murder, and he was due to be sentenced on 22 December 2008, but this was deferred to 6 February 2009. On 6 February 2009, Phillip was sentenced to life in prison.

Reepham High School and College

Reepham High School and College is a secondary school and sixth form with academy status located in Reepham, a small market town in the English county of Norfolk. It is a specialist Science, Applied Learning and Mathematics & Computing centre and has around 1050 pupils on roll. The majority of the students live in outlying villages. Prior to September 2009, when Reepham College opened, it was known as Reepham High School. Mark Farrar is the current principal.
History.
The school opened with around 200 pupils in 1961 as a secondary modern school. The first head was Edward Riddell Smith.
College.
The college, which was previously an 11 to 16 school, added a sixth form in 2009 with a £6,000,000 sixth-form centre investment. A new £280,000 playing field, and additional science classrooms have also been added in recent years.
Achievements.
In 2006, the "Eastern Daily Press" reported that Reepham High was the only school in Norfolk to carry Ofsted’s “Outstanding” ranking. In September 2008, the school was ranked “Outstanding” for a third time, and the school scored the overall grade possible. The school’s website heralded the news thus:
In the early 2006/07 school year rumours circulated that the school’s authorities were attempting to apply for an ‘Arts College’ specialism to add to their belt. However, at the Year 11 Awards Evening on 18 November 2006, Hassell revealed that the specialism would in fact be ‘vocationalism’, and since then Reepham High School and College has become a specialist Science, Mathematics and Vocational school.
The school has been included in the Sunday Times “Best Schools Guide” for achieving the 23rd highest GCSE pass rate at A*–C as a percentage of examination entry in Britain’s state schools.
Notable alumni.
Norwich City goalkeeper Jed Steer attended the school as did Carl Rogers, captain of Norfolk County Cricket Club from 2009 to 2010.
Matthew Fletcher.
Matthew was a sufferer of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, which took his life on the 23 November 2006 at age 16. Born 26 September 1990, he lived all his life in Cawston.
First diagnosed in November 2005, Fletcher achieved fame for his constant struggle against the illness while studying at Reepham High School, Norfolk, UK. He is credited for doing much to raise awareness for Leukaemia sufferers, particularly through his work with the Anthony Nolan Trust. His work and life earned him considerable attention in the local newspaper, the "Eastern Daily Press", often to the size of double-page-inside spreads.
Matthew recorded an audio diary for BBC Radio Norfolk. Extracts from this audio diary were played on the BBC Radio 4 programme "Pick of the Week" presented by Robin Lustig.
The week before his death Matthew was given the “Community Student of the Year” award from Reepham High School and a recorded video message from him was played to the school.

The herbarium is staffed by the South African National Biodiversity Institute and has material dating back to 1812, collected by William John Burchell, as well as geological material gathered by Andrew Geddes Bain and W. G. Atherstone. It also houses a large collection of South African vertebrate and invertebrate fossils, and palaeolithic stone tools discovered by Thomas Holden Bowker (1808–1885) near the Great Fish River.
The Museum currently is spread over seven buildings housing the Natural Sciences Museum, the History Museum, the Observatory Museum, Fort Selwyn, the Old Provost military prison, Drostdy Arch and the Old Priest’s House.
The first curator was B. J. Glanville, who acted in an honorary capacity between 1855 and 1882. Then a small stipend was offered and the position was taken by Mary Glanville until 1888 when S. Mundy, a temporary curator took over and was replaced by Selmar Schonland in 1889. Schonland filled the post until 1910 and handed the reins to John Hewitt who managed the museum for an extraordinarily long term from 1910 to 1958. He was succeeded by T. H. Barry, appointed Director of the South African Museum in Cape Town in 1964 and was in turn followed in 1965 by the entomologist Charles Jacot-Guillarmod (the husband of Amy Jacot Guillarmod).

Dominion (card game)

Dominion is a deck-building game created by Donald X. Vaccarino and published by Rio Grande Games. Each player uses a separate deck of cards to which only he or she has access; players draw their hands from their own decks, not others'. During turns, players use their cards to perform various actions and purchase cards from a common pool of card stacks available to all players, including those that give them more actions, coins to purchase cards, and victory cards that are otherwise valueless during the game. At the end of the game, defined when certain common stacks are exhausted, the player with the highest number of victory points wins. The game has a light medieval theme, with card names that reference pre-industrial, monarchical, and feudal social structures.
Some have drawn parallels with collectible card games such as "", with the distinction that players build their decks "ad hoc" as the game proceeds. (Vaccarino, however, denies that Magic was the inspiration.) "Dominion" is the first game of its kind, and has spawned a genre of similar card-based games, dubbed "deck-builders". Vaccarino developed "Dominion" with expansion sets in mind that introduced new mechanics atop the existing base set, opening the game to numerous variations of play.
The game was released at Spiel 2008 in multiple languages and voted best game of the fair by the Fairplay polls with a rating of 1.75 from 147 votes. In 2009, it won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres and Deutscher Spiele Preis awards. It was one of five winning games in American Mensa's 2009 MindGame competition. By the end of 2010, more than one million copies of it and its expansions had been sold worldwide.
Gameplay.
"Dominion" is a deck-building card game in which two or more players compete to gather the most valuable deck of cards. There are four main classes of cards:
There are other modifying card types. Attack cards generally adversely affect other players, such as forcing them to discard cards from their hand or gain Curse cards. Reaction cards can be triggered out of turn in response to a certain event, such as other players' Attacks.
Some cards are hybrids of the above classes, such as an Action-Victory card which can be used during a player's turn but also counts as some number of Victory Points at the end of the game.
The game is always set up with the same seven stacks of basic cards; there are three stacks of Victory cards, one stack of Curse cards, and three stacks of Treasure cards. In addition, ten stacks of Kingdom cards (typically Action cards) are added to the table. The Kingdom cards can be either selected by the players or chosen randomly. Certain Kingdom cards from the game's expansions may require additional stacks to be added, such as the Potion card (a Treasure card) from the "Alchemy" expansion. These piles represent the finite Supply of cards. Finally, each player receives the same starting deck of ten cards, consisting of seven basic Treasure cards and usually three basic Victory cards. Each player shuffles their deck, and draws the top five cards to form their hand to start the game.
Each turn, the player performs the following phases (abbreviated as "ABC" to help new players remember the order):
If at any time the player must draw a card from their deck, but their deck is empty, they shuffle their existing discard pile and use it as their new deck. Some Action cards can "trash" cards, removing them from the game permanently.
The game ends under two conditions: when the stack of Province cards (the highest-value Victory card in the base game) has been exhausted, or when any three other stacks in the Supply have been exhausted. At that time, the players count the number of Victory Points in their complete decks, and the player with the highest score is the winner. Other end-game conditions have been introduced in the game's expansions.
The game has been compared to the "draft" gameplay style of collectible card games where players vie for the best deck from a common pool of cards. Usually, the game's main strategy is to strive to build a deck that maximizes the player's ability to draw hands that provide 8 coins, which then allows the player to purchase a Province card, the highest value Victory card in the base game. Players must balance effective deck building to reach this coin goal with the acquisition of Victory cards to win the game; most Victory cards have no value during most of the game, and dilute a player's deck of Treasure and Action cards, clogging up their draws.
History.
Vaccarino was a video game programmer and developer in San Francisco in the 1980s and 1990s, during which he spent time playing German-style board games that were coming out, prior to the release of "Magic: The Gathering" in 1993. His interest in "Magic" sparked his own development of a 90-card fan-made extension for the game, "Edge of the World", and he would become an informal contributor towards additional "Magic" works, including being credited in the official "Magic" rulebook. He developed several game ideas in the intervening years and discussed them with "Magic"s creator, Richard Garfield.
In 2006, Vaccarino invented the deck-building mechanic while working on a fantasy adventure card game called "Spirit Warriors II". He struggled with the mechanics of the game before a deadline of showing the game to his local gaming group, and spent one weekend to strip down the game to its core elements; specifically, having problems with the concept of introducing cards that could be acquired over time, Vaccarino instead opted to simply have all such cards available at the start of the game. Vaccarino introduced the game to his local gaming group at a gaming store; the game immediately became popular, overshadowing the usual staples including "Magic" over the next two years.
With the success of the game with his local group, Vaccarino began looking to refine and publish the game. During the 2007 Origins Game Fair, Vaccarino demonstrated the game, and got the interest of Rio Grande Games. Shortly after being signed on with Rio Grande, Board Game Geek's columnists Valerie Putman and Dale Yu requested Rio Grande to allow them to develop the game. During development, "Dominion" was called "Castle Builder", due to its theme of building rooms in a castle, and then, later, "Game X"; Yu is credited with the final name of "Dominion". Vaccarino had planned early on for the game to grow through expansions, though focused these on maintaining the core functionality of the game instead of immediately adding "exotic things"; this was to ensure that, if the game did take off, early expansions would not create two disparate sets of cards, one focused on the normal "Dominion" play, and a second with a strange new mechanic. In a post to Board Game Geek, Vaccarino suggested that he had originally planned out seven different expansions from the start, and in fact, in tuning the core game for release, took cards originally planned for later expansions into the base game.
Dominion has been translated into 18 languages (Chinese, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish and Swedish), comprising 6 different alphabets.
Releases.
"Standalone" means that the set comes with the basic cards required for every play: Estates, Duchies, Provinces, Coppers, Silvers, Golds, Curses, and a Trash card.
Vaccarino plans to stop expanding the game after "Guilds", though he concedes:
Promotional Cards.
Mini-expansions, consisting each of a set of a single kind of Kingdom card, have been released as promotional items.
On the 23rd of January of 2014 Donald X. Vaccarino said "There will probably be a Dominion promocard this year".
Online Play.
A licensed browser-based online implementation of Dominion, hosted by Goko, went live in early March 2013. It was originally intended to be released to the public on August 16, 2012, but because of bugs and server overload, it was withdrawn from public release and returned to beta testing. The official app provides the base Dominion game free to play, and cards from the expansions are available for a fee.
Several unofficial online implementations of Dominion existed prior to the official implementation's launch; Rio Grande Games has requested that these unofficial Dominion implementations be discontinued now that the official online implementation is released. One of these unofficial implementations, located at dominion.isotropic.org, was used by Dominion designer Donald X. Vaccarino to play-test the development of new cards.
Storage Solutions.
With over 3000 cards available with Dominion and all of its expansions, Rio Grande Games has licensed out to certain manufacturers to create storage containers to combine all of the cards into one or two boxes to facilitate storage and transportation issues with owners of multiple expansions.

Angelo Ogbonna

Angelo Obinze Ogbonna (born 23 May 1988) is an Italian footballer of Nigerian descent who occasionally plays as a centre back for Serie A club Juventus and the Italian national team.
Club career.
Torino.
Born in Cassino and of Nigerian descent, Ogbonna was noted by Torino scouts and was later signed by the "Granata" youth academy. He made his Serie A and first-team debut on 11 February 2007 in a 1–2 home defeat against Reggina, playing the entire 90 minutes. He made three further Serie A appearances that season. He then spent the 2007–08 season on loan at Crotone, making 22 league appearances that season.
Ogbonna returned to Torino ahead of the 2008–09 Serie A season, playing mostly as a backup to regulars Cesare Natali and Marco Di Loreto, although he still managed 19 league appearances for the "Granata". Torino, however, were relegated to Serie B at the end of the season. Starting from 2009, after the relegation of the club to Serie B, Ogbonna earned his place as a starter, making 31 league appearances and scoring one goal for the Piedmont-based club during the 2009–10 season. In three Serie B seasons with Torino, Ogbonna made 105 appearances, helping the club return to Serie A after finishing second to Pescara during the 2011–12 season. On 2 February 2012, he renewed his contract with Torino until 30 June 2016.
Ogbonna's first full Serie A season was hampered by two lengthy injuries that limited the player to just 22 league matches. Likewise, Torino's return to the Italian top-flight began well but a dip in form late in the season left the club in a lowly 16th place finish in the league standings.
Juventus.
On 11 July 2013, Ogbonna officially underwent medical examimations at Turin's Fornaca, Isokinetic and the Istituto di Medicina dello Sport ahead of his proposed cross-town move to incumbent league champions Juventus.
International career.
On 12 August 2009, he made his debut with the Italian under-21 national team in a friendly game against Russia.
On 4 June 2011, Ogbonna received his first senior squad call-up by coach Cesare Prandelli, despite playing in Serie B. He is the first Torino player to be called up to the "Azzurri" since 2007. Following several injuries in the "Azzurri" squad, Ogbonna was called up again on 5 October 2011. He made his senior debut on 11 November 2011 in a friendly won 2–0 against Poland, where he came on as substitute for Domenico Criscito in the 77th minute.
Ogbonna was included in the Italian 23-man final squad for UEFA Euro 2012, but never played in any match during the competition.
After he's showing of defensive skill for he's club, he was included in Cesare Prandelli 23 men for the Confederations Cup 2013.

IK Investment Partners

IK Investment Partners (formerly known as Industri Kapital) is a leading European private equity firm, focusing on investments in the Nordic region, Benelux, France and Germany. Since inception, the firm has raised a total of €5.7 billion in investor commitments. The firm invests primarily in middle market companies. 
The firm, which is headquartered at Brettenham House in London has offices in Hamburg, Paris and Stockholm. IK operates through six investment teams covering Benelux, Denmark, Norway, Finland, France, Germany/CEE and Sweden. 
History.
IK Investment Partners was founded under the name Industri Kapital by Björn Savén and Kim Wahl. The firm’s origins lie in Enskilda Ventures which in 1989 sponsored Björn Savén in raising the Scandinavian Acquisition Capital Fund (SAC) and established the London office. SAC closed with approximately €108 million in commitments mainly from Scandinavian investors. 
In the year 1993 Industri Kapital became independent through the management buyout of SAC’s assets and activities from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the parent of Enskilda Ventures. SAC’s was renamed the Industri Kapital 1989 fund. In the same year the company established offices in Stockholm and Oslo. 
In 2011 Industry Kapital suffered major losses in the bankruptcy and sale of Moventas Oy, a Finnish maker of wind turbines.
Funds.
Industri Kapital’s second fund, IK 1994, held its final closing with commitments totaling €250 million, broadening the investor base to include European and North American investors. 
In 1997 Industri Kapital inaugurated its Hamburg office and closed its third fund, IK 1997, with commitments of €750 million. The year after the firm completed it first investment in Germany. 
The fourth fund, IK 2000, closed with €2.2 billion in commitments in the year 2000. IK 2000 made its first investment in France. Three years later, in 2003 Industri Kapital began raising its fifth fund, IK 2004. The firm struggled in the fundraising markets, requiring over two years to hold a final closing on the fund. IK completed fundraising in 2005 with €825 million in commitments. The firm's Paris office was opened the year after. 
In the year 2007 Industri Kapital closed its sixth fund, IK2007, with commitments of €1.7 billion. 
The first investment in Poland was being made with the IK 2004 fund in year 2008. The transaction is IK’s first direct investment in the region and marks the start of the firm’s plans to invest directly in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and the Baltic States, in addition to its operations in Benelux, France, Germany and Scandinavia.
In September 2013, it was announced that Global fuel testing firm DNV Petroleum Services (DNVPS) would be acquired by private equity firm IK Investment Partners, after it was left out of the recent DNV GL merger.
Henrik Madsen, president and ceo of DNV GL Group, said the sale of DNVPS by DNV is based on a review of the DNV Foundation's total portfolio of activities following the merger of the two classification societies.

Ropar Wetland

Ropar Wetland, also named Ropar Lake, is a man-made freshwater riverine and lacustrine wetland. The area has at least 9 mammal, 154 bird (migratory and local), 35 fish, 9 arthropod, 11 rotifer, 9 crustacean and 10 protozoan species, making it biologically diverse.
This important ecological zone is located in the Shivalik foothills of the Lower Himalayas and was created in 1952 on the Sutlej River, in the Punjab state of India, by building a head regulator to store and divert water for beneficial uses of irrigation, drinking and industrial water supply. The endangered turtle Chitra indica and the threatened snake Python molurus ("at lower risk"), as per IUCN Redlist, are reported to be resident in the wetland. Considering the wetland’s diverse and rich biodiversity, Ramsar Convention has included Ropar Wetland (listed as Ropar Lake) as one of the Ramsar sites among the 21 sites listed under India, for “the conservation of global biological diversity and for sustaining human life through the ecological and hydrological functions they perform.”
The wetland is a popular tourist attraction for bird watching and boating. A tourism complex called the ‘Pinccasia’ is located within the wetland boundary, which is run by the Punjab Tourism Development Corporation. A Boat Club is also functioning.
Access.
The wetland is located close to the Rupnagar city, 45 km northwest of Chandigarh City, in Roopnagar and Nawanshahr districts of Punjab. Chandigarh is the nearest airport, which connects to the rest of India.
History.
An archaeological museum of the Archaeological Survey of India at Ropar has displays of the antiquities unearthed during the excavations of mound in the area along with photographs displaying excavation material. The Museum depicts a sequence of six cultural periods or phases, with some breaks from Harappan times to the present day, found in the 21 metre high ancient mound known as Nalagarh Tibbi overlaying the Shiwalik (also spelt Sivalik) deposition on the left bank of the Satluj River where it emerges into the plains. A deep well with a stone inscription of Emperor Shah Jahan (A.D. 1627-1658) has been located at the foot of the mound. The excavations have established that advanced civilization similar to the Harappa and Mohenjodaro Civilization prospered in Ropar town, an integral part of the wetland. 
The wetland area has also a modern history in respect of Anglo - Sikh relations. On 26 October 1831, sitting under the shade of an old ficus tree on the bank of Sutlej River, Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Lord William Bentinck, the British Governor General signed an agreement defining the Anglo - Sikh relations and territories.
Topography.
The total area covered by the Wetland is 1365 ha, which includes 800 ha area of the river and the reservoir, 30 ha of forest area named as Sadavarat Forest and 30 ha under marshy plants. The wetland is surrounded by hills in the North West and by plain area in the South and South East. Agricultural crops such as wheat, rice, sugarcane, sorghum etc., are grown in the farm lands in the area surrounding the wetland but the hills have thin vegetation and are exposed to intensive grazing.
Hydrology.
Climatically, the drainage area of the wetland falls under semi-arid zone of Punjab with mean annual rainfall of 1518 mm. Initially, in the year 1882, a small headwork was constructed on the right bank of Sutlej River, near Ropar town, to supply water to Sirhind Canal. Subsequently in 1952 a head regulator was constructed to divert water not only to the Bist Doab Canal but also to Sirhind Canal and to the Bhakra Main Canal (upstream of the wetland), for irrigation, industrial and domestic use.
Water quality.
Water Quality that determines the health of ecosystem of the wetland was monitored by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) in the year 1998-99. The water quality was reported to be of 'A' category as the river entered into Punjab and deteriorated to 'D' category downstream of Ropar Lake, mainly due to the industrial effluents from a number of factories and industrial units. Further studies on physico-chemical analysis of important parameters, biological estimations as well as pesticide residue analysis have been initiated.
Flora and fauna.
The wetland is rich in flora and fauna which are categorized below.
Flora.
A total of 19 species of trees and 14 species of bushes and grasses are recorded. Of these, the tree species are 1) Acacia catechu, 2) Ameles modesta, 3)Acacia nilotica, 4) Albizzia lebbek 5) Azadirachta indica, 6)Bombax ceiba, 7) Cassia fistula, 8) Dalbergia sissoo 9) Eucalyptus tereticornis, 10) Ficus benghalensis, 11)Ficus religiosa, 12) Mangifera indica, 13)Melia azedarach, 14) Moringa oleifera, 15) Morus indica, 16) Prosopis juliflora, 17) Salix willow, 18)Syzygium cumini (Jambul) and 19) Zizyphus jujuba.
Aqua fauna.
Wetland is a major source of fisheries since large species of fishes have been recorded; some of the commercially important ones are:
Four species of Amphibia (Frogs) have been noted.
Avi fauna.
Several species of birds have been recorded which include 49 species of local birds, 11 species of migratory birds, 3 species of rare birds and 54 species of common birds. Some of the rare birds among the migratory birds noted are:
Fauna.
Two species of tortoise viz., Geoclemys hamiltonii and Chitra indica (endangered species), five species of lizards, 11 species of snakes including the threatened specie of Python molurus or Indian python or ajgar are found in the wetland.
Food chain.
The food chain in the wetland is basically well balanced as it has both deep water and shallow water characteristics and the ecosystem is stated to be 
"almost self sufficient and self-regulating." A Scientific study of the food chain has brought out the following sequence of facts. 
Adverse impacts on the wetland.
Over the years several adverse impacts on the quality of the wetland have been reported. Some of the important ones which invited remedial actions are:
Restoration measures.
The Punjab State Council for Science & Technology has evolved several conservation programmes with support from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoE&F) of the Govt of India. Some of the programmes implemented include mass awareness campaigns and promotion of public participation in the wetland conservation. A few of the measures planned and under various stages of implementation are:

Valentine Cary

Valentine Cary (also spelled Carey or Carew) (died 1626) was an English clergyman, who became bishop of Exeter.
Life.
He was an illegitimate son of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon. He was a graduate of Christ's College, Cambridge, and a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge in 1591.
A pluralist, he was vicar of East Tilbury in 1603, rector at Great Parndon 1606 to 1616, and was vicar of Epping Upland from 1607 to 1609. He was also rector of Orsett and Toft from 1610.
In 1609 he became Master of Christ's College, where he had been a Fellow from 1597 to 1600. The election was bitterly contested, by the Puritan element. Cary was backed by the Lord Chancellor, Baron Ellesmere. It led immediately to a confrontation between Cary and William Ames, who refused to wear the surplice, and who left Cambridge almost immediately. It also led Cary to be suspicious of Joseph Mede, who was to be one of Christ's best-known Fellows.
He was later Dean of St. Paul's. In 1621 he was appointed bishop of Exeter. There is a memorial to him in Exeter Cathedral; he was buried in the old St Paul's Cathedral.

Gay (magazine)

Gay was Toronto's first gay magazine, published almost simultaneously with "ASK Newsletter", together Canada's first gay magazines. The earliest periodical anywhere to use 'Gay' in its title. Produced by four Toronto men in a commercial venture, the Gay Publishing Company, "Gay" ran serious articles, letters to the editor, a diary, gossip columns, a feature called the "Gabrial Club", poetry, fiction, politics and a discrete personals column. "Gay" was illustrated, usually with photographs of drag queens, but also including 'physique' photography.
Intended for a 'mainstream' gay audience it reflected cautious reformism, defending the rights and normalcy of a constituency living in a hostile environment. This was not unlike the political activism emerging in a few large American and European cities before more confrontational activism. "Gay" also published on Toronto police raids on bars, and on the calls for social and political change that were beginning to surface.
The first five-hundred-copy issue sold out almost immediately. Printing two thousand copies by issue three, distributed to a number of outlets in Toronto and Montreal. Shortly, "Gay" expanded into the United States as "Gay International". It quickly outstripped American publications' distributions, and by the spring of 1965 it was publishing twenty thousand copies across North America and selling about eight thousand. Publication ended in 1966 when criminal charges were levied against one of its central creators.

SRT1720

SRT1720 is an experimental drug that was studied by Sirtris Pharmaceuticals intended as a small-molecule activator of the sirtuin subtype SIRT1. The compound has been studied in animals, but safety and efficacy in humans have not been established.
Animal research.
In animal models of obesity and diabetes it was found to improve insulin sensitivity and lower plasma glucose levels in fat, muscle and liver tissue, and increased mitochondrial and metabolic function. In mice rendered obese and diabetic by feeding a high-fat, high-sugar diet, a study performed at the National Institute of Aging found that feeding chow infused with the highest dose of SRT1720 beginning at one year of age increased mean lifespan by 18%, and maximum lifespan by 5%, as compared to other short-lived obese, diabetic mice; however, treated animals still lived substantially shorter lives than normal-weight mice fed normal chow with no drug. In a later study, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan of obese, diabetic mice by 21.7%, similar to the earlier study, but there was no effect on maximum lifespan in this study. In normal-weight mice fed a standard rodent diet, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan by just 8.8%, and again had no effect on maximum lifespan.
Since the discovery of SRT1720, the claim that this compound is a SIRT1 activator has been questioned
and further defended.
Although SRT1720 is not currently undergoing clinical development, a related compound, SRT2104, is currently in clinical development for metabolic diseases.

2007 Indoor Cricket World Cup

The 2007 Indoor Cricket World Cup was an Indoor Cricket tournament that took place in Bristol, England from the 22nd to 29 September 2007 involving both a men's and a women's division. There were a total of 35 matches played in the men's division and 26 matches played in the women's division.
The men's division was split into two stages (in addition to finals) with each side playing each other once before being split into two groups, the top four and the bottom three. The top four sides progressed to a Super 4's stage where they again played each other once in order to be ranked for the semi finals. The semi finals featured Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa with Australia defeating South Africa in the final to record their sixth consecutive World Cup. The top three sides contested a subsidiary title, won by England.
Whilst the women's division was not split into separate stages it did employ a more complicated semi final system that gave all five nations the opportunity of progressing through to the final during the finals stage. South Africa advanced straight through to the final after defeating Australia in the semi finals stage, though Australia then prevailed over New Zealand and were able to reverse their semi final result to defeat South Africa in the final. This was the fifth consecutive World Cup for Australia.
The 2007 Junior World Series of Indoor Cricket was held alongside this event.
Host Selection.
The World Cup was awarded to England by the WICF at the conclusion of the previous World Cup. As a result England became the first nation to host the World Cup twice having held the first tournament in 1995.
Venue.
The England Indoor Cricket Association determined that the Action Indoor Sports Stadium in Bristol would host all World Cup matches and Bristol became the host city as a result. All World Cup matches were played at the same venue.
Participants.
Men's Division
India were also initially entered in the men's division but were late withdrawals from the competition.

Super 4's Stage.
The top four sides at the conclusion of the round robin series progressed through to the Super 4 stage of the tournament. The bottom three sides were relegated to the "World Cup Plate" division and, together with the team that finished 4th after the Super 4's stage, competed for a separate subordinate trophy.
Men's Division - Top Four
Men's Division - Bottom Three
Women's Division
There was no Super 4's stage in the women's division.
Semi finals.
The World Cup finals operated under a different format in each division. In the men's division the winner of the two semi finals proceeded to the final and the remaining two sides competed for the bronze medal match.
The World Cup Plate final was contested between the loser of the bronze medal match and the highest ranked side from the bottom three during the Super 4's stage.
The women's division employed a slightly more complicated format. The fourth and fifth placed sides faced off against one another with the winner taking on third place to earn a right in the preliminary final. The top two sides competed in a major semi final with the winner progressing to the final and the loser taking the second spot in the preliminary final. The remaining spot in the World Cup final was assumed by the winner of the preliminary final.
Men's Division
"Semi Final 1 (1st vs 4th) - winner to final, loser to bronze medal match"
"Semi Final 2 (2nd vs 3rd) - winner to final, loser to bronze medal match"
"Bronze Medal Match - winner receives bronze medal, loser to World Cup Plate final"
Women's Division
"Major Semi Final (1st vs 2nd) - winner to final, loser to preliminary final"
"Qualifying Final (3rd vs 5th) - winner to minor semi final, loser knocked out"
"Minor Semi Final - winner to preliminary final, loser knocked out"
"Preliminary Final - winner to final, loser knocked out"
Finals.
Men's Division
"World Cup"The World Cup final was contested between Australia and South Africa. This final was the sixth consecutive appearance in a World Cup final and was the first for South Africa. Despite performing below expectations early in the tournament, Australia easily accounted for England in their semi final. The South African side, on the other hand, came through a tough encounter with the New Zealand side by just three runs.
In the end, Australia managed a narrow but comfortable victory to claim their sixth consecutive title.
"World Cup Plate"A secondary and subordinate final was played between England (the loser of the bronze medal match) and France (the highest ranked side from the bottom three teams). England rebounded from their heavy loss against New Zealand in the bronze medal match to claim the first Plate title.
Women's Division
The Women's World Cup Final featured Australia and South Africa. South Africa entered the side as favourites having accounted for Australia in all but one of their encounters in the earlier stages of the World Cup. Australia, however, rebounded and managed to claim their fifth consecutive World Cup title.

London Heathrow Terminal 4

London Heathrow Terminal 4 is an airport terminal at London Heathrow Airport, serving the British capital city of London and situated to the south of the southern runway, next to the cargo terminal. It is connected to Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 3 by the vehicular Heathrow Cargo Tunnel, and by rail with the Heathrow Terminal 4 tube station and Heathrow Terminal 4 railway station.
Built at a cost of £200 million, Terminal 4 was opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales on 1 April 1986. Until 2008 it was used mainly by British Airways. It became the Heathrow base for airlines of the SkyTeam airline alliance after British Airways vacated Terminal 4 on 29 October 2009 and moved to Terminal 5.
Design.
The terminal was initially designed as a facility for short-haul 'point-to-point' traffic, to compensate for its relatively long distance from the airport's central terminal area (CTA). The layout of the terminal, with passenger boarding gates very close to the check-in and security halls, was designed to facilitate rapid movement of passengers through the building (a requirement for short-haul, business-focused flights). Upon opening, it boasted other innovations including the complete segregation of arriving and departing passengers and a departure concourse over long. 
Lord King, then Chairman of British Airways, demanded that Terminal 4 be solely for the use of British Airways in order to fulfill the airline's ambition of hosting all its flights in one terminal (an ambition that has still not been realised even with the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008). A similar demand was made on the North Terminal at Gatwick.
Thus Terminal 4's distance from the CTA and design were ill-suited for British Airways' long-haul operations and could be seen as a contributor to the airline's dire operational performance, particularly in the years up to Terminal 5's opening in 2008. For example, passengers had to transfer between Terminal 4 and the CTA by bus rather than by a short moving walkway (as between Terminals 1 and 3 for example) and once inside Terminal 4, the gate areas are not large enough for the 400+ passengers waiting to board the waiting 747s. Passengers' baggage also had to make the trip by van, sometimes resulting in the luggage being mislaid, although this problem was somewhat alleviated in the late 1990s by the construction of an automated transfer tunnel between the CTA and Terminal 4.
Improvements and renovations.
Following the transfer of most of British Airways' flights to Terminal 5 during 2008, Terminal 4 is underwent a £200m upgrade to enable it to accommodate 45 airlines and serve as the base for the SkyTeam airline alliance. The forecourt has been upgraded to reduce traffic congestion and improve security and an extended check-in area opened in late 2009. Piers and departure lounges were renovated, whilst a new SkyTeam Alliance passenger lounge for premium passengers opened in 2009, more recently followed by the Etihad Airways Lounge. A Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge, Gulf Air Golden Falcon Lounge and a Qatar Airways Premium Lounge have all opened since 2010. Two new stands to accommodate the Airbus A380 have been constructed, and a new baggage system has been installed.
Airlines and destinations.
In 2011 Terminal 4 handled 9.9 million passengers on 62,039 flights.
Ground Transportation.
Road links.
Terminal 4 is accessed from Junction 14 of the M25 motorway via the A3113 and then the Southern Perimeter Road. It is also accessible from Central London via the A4 and then the A30. There is a short stay car park directly opposite the terminal and a long stay car park on the other side of the twin rivers.
Rail links.
Terminal 4 is served by Heathrow Terminal 4 tube station on the Piccadilly Line of the London Underground and by Heathrow Connect trains at Heathrow Terminal 4 station. Heathrow Connect provides a stopping service to London Paddington also stopping at Heathrow Central station (There is no charge for train journeys between Terminal 4 and Central stations). Heathrow Connect is intended to be taken over by Crossrail when Crossrail eventually opens, and would have 4 trains per hour compared to the current 2 trains per hour.
The Piccadilly Line has up to 6 trains per hour (about every 10 minutes) in the direction of Cockfosters station via Central London. Trains run via Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 station. They may wait at Terminal 4 for up to 8 minutes. Although the journey takes longer, fares are cheaper than on Heathrow Connect services.
Bus Links.
Terminal 4 is served by some local buses and coach services.
As of 2009, bus services include:
"* - Buses marked with an asterisk run as part of the London bus network on behalf of TfL"

TSV Gerbrunn

The TSV Gerbrunn is a German association football club from the municipality of Gerbrunn, Bavaria.
The club's greates success came in 2002, when it won promotion to the tier four Bayernliga, but it lasted for only one season at this level.
History.
Formed in 1877 as a gymnastics club, the Turnverein Gerbrunn, for the most part of its history, existed as a lower amateur side.
The club rose to a short stint of Bavarian prominence in 1998 when it won the "Bezirksoberliga Unterfranken" (VI) in its first season in the league. From there it advanced to the "Landesliga Bayern-Nord" (V) where it finished in mid-table for the next three years.
The 2001–02 season was to become the club's greatest so far, winning the "Landesliga" and earning promotion to the "Bayernliga" (IV), the highest league in the state.
In the "Bayernliga" the TSV Gerbrunn found the going hard and was eventually relegated, coming last out of eighteen teams. However, the "TSV" won the local Unterfranken Cup, earning it the right to compete in the Bavarian Cup. In this competition, the team went all the way to the final.
Financial considerations forced the club to withdraw to the "Kreisklasse Würzburg" instead of entering the "Landesliga" for 2003–04. Due to the Bavarian Cup final being played at the beginning of the next season, the "TSV" found itself with a much weaker team and was sorely defeated by the TSV Aindling, 0–14. Having qualified for the German Cup by reaching the Bavarian final, the team met the SV Wacker Burghausen, where another 0–14 defeat meant a harsh end to its area of higher league football. It was only one goal off the record cup defeat of DJK Waldberg against Bayern Munich, who lost 1–16 in 1997. Five of Gerbrunn's players, including the goal keeper Stylianos Voulgaris, played in both matches.
The TSV Gerbrunn returned to local amateur league football in the Würzburg region, where it spent most of its previous history. In its first season there, 2003–04, it suffered another relegation, down to the lowest level, the "A-Klasse". A last place finish with 29 loses and one draw to its name, 122 goals scored against, culminated a season that had started with the 0–14 cup los. Gerbrunn actually remained without a win for 15 month, until 29 August 2004, when it beat SV Heidingsfeld II 4–2. Its last victory before that, still in the "Bayernliga", was on 11 May 2003, ironically against the TSV Aindling.
The "TSV" now plays in the "Kreisklasse Würzburg-Gruppe 1", the ninth division of the Bavarian league system, with a second place in 2010-11 as its best result.

London Heathrow Terminal 3

London Heathrow Terminal 3 is an airport terminal at London Heathrow Airport, serving the British capital city of London. Terminal 3 is currently used by Oneworld, Star Alliance members, as well as a few other non-affiliated airlines. It is also the hub for Virgin Atlantic's long-haul operations. 
History.
Opened as The Oceanic Terminal on 13 November 1961, it was built to handle flight departures for long-haul routes. At this time the airport had a direct helicopter service to Central London from the gardens on the roof of the terminal building. Renamed Terminal 3 in 1968, it was expanded in 1970 with the addition of an arrivals building. Other facilities added included the UK's first moving walkways. In 2006, the new £105 million Pier 6 was completed to accommodate the Airbus A380 superjumbo; Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Qantas now operate regular flights from Terminal 3 using the Airbus A380. Redevelopment of Terminal 3's forecourt through the addition of a new four lane drop-off area and a large pedestrianised plaza, complete with canopy to the front of the terminal building, was completed in 2007. These improvements were intended to improve passengers' experiences, reduce traffic congestion and improve security. As part of this project, Virgin Atlantic was assigned its own dedicated check-in area, known as 'Zone A', which features a large sculpture and atrium. Heathrow Airport Limited also has plans for a £1bn upgrade of the rest of the terminal over the next ten years which will include the renovation of aircraft piers and the arrivals forecourt. A new baggage system connecting to Terminal 5 (for British Airways connections) is currently under construction. In addition to the baggage system, the baggage claim hall is also set to undergo changes with dedicated A380 belts and an improved design and layout.
As of 2013, Terminal 3 has an area of .
Airlines and destinations.
In 2011 Terminal 3 handled 19.4 million passengers on 104,100 flights. Terminal 3 is used by the majority of Oneworld alliance partners (except British Airways who use Terminal 1 and Terminal 5, Iberia (Terminal 5), Malaysian Airlines (Terminal 4) and Qatar Airways (Terminal 4)). 
The main presences in Terminal 3 are Air Canada, American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic who have their UK hubs located here. British Airways also have a significant presence, mostly due to restricted capacity in Terminal 5. 
After Terminal 2 is completed in June 2014, it is expected that all Star Alliance airlines currently based in Terminal 3 will move to Terminal 2 throughout 2014. Proposals have been made to demolish Terminal 3 to make way for another phase of Terminal 2. 
Inter-terminal Transport.
Terminal 3 is connected by an underground subway to Terminal 1. Terminal 4 can be reached by the free Heathrow Connect transfer service and likewise, Terminal 5 can be reached by the free Heathrow Express transfer service. In addition, numerous buses ply between the Central Bus Station (Terminal 1 & 3) and terminal 4 & 5, however using the train service is much quicker and easier for passengers with luggage. The bus service is free between terminals.
Ground Transport.
Road links.
As part of the three central terminals at Heathrow, it is well linked to the M4 motorway via the M4 spur road and through a tunnel under the north runway. There is a large, multi-storey car park opposite the Terminal connected by an aerial footbridge.
Rail links.
Terminal 3 is accessed by the London Underground from Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 tube station, with trains towards Cockfosters station via Central London. The Terminal is also accessed by Heathrow Connect and Express from Heathrow Central where services go to London Paddington. Heathrow Connect services are due to be replaced by Crossrail when it finally opens at some point in the future and services would be increased from 2 trains per hour (about every 30 minutes) to 4 trains per hour (about every 15 minutes).
Bus links.
Terminal 3 is accessible to both bus and coach services from Heathrow central bus station.
Current services are:
"* - Buses marked with an asterisk run as part of the London bus network on behalf of TfL"
There are also several coach services operated by National Express operating to other London airports such as Gatwick, Stansted & Luton and other cities in the United Kingdom.

London Heathrow Terminal 1

London Heathrow Terminal 1 is an airport terminal at London Heathrow Airport, serving the capital city of London, used primarily by British Airways and Star Alliance airlines. Terminal 1 was opened in 1968 and was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II in May 1969. At the time Terminal 1 was the biggest short-haul terminal of its kind in Western Europe. In 2005, a substantial redesign and redevelopment of Terminal 1 was completed, which saw the opening of the new Eastern Extension, doubling the departure lounge in size and creating additional seating and retail space. Destinations from Terminal 1 include domestic airports, all Irish routes along with a wide range of European and long haul destinations.
Future.
Heathrow Airport Limited has confirmed that, following the opening of the new Terminal 2 and resulting airline moves, it will close Terminal 1 as soon as practicable.
Domestic and Irish flights.
Unlike Terminal 5, Terminal 1 Domestic flights and Irish flights have a completely separate departure/arrival area from other (International) flights. This was originally used for all domestic flights at Heathrow, and this area of the terminal was occupied by British Airways, Aer Lingus and British Midland (BMI), until British Airways moved all its domestic flights to Terminal 5 when it opened in 2008. It is still used by Aer Lingus, whilst BMI's takeover by the International Airlines Group, and the subsequent sale of some of its domestic slots to Virgin Atlantic has seen Virgin's "Little Red" operation now occupy BMI's old domestic departure lounge at Gate 8, alongside British Airways.
Following the initial departure of British Airways from the terminal in 2009, the area was redesigned so that all passengers pass through the international departure lounge. Domestic and Republic of Ireland passengers pass through an ID check where a photo taken of them at security control is checked to ensure that the correct person is entering the domestic and Irish departure area.
Since the buyout of British Midland International, British Airways service some Short-Haul and Medium-Haul destinations from this terminal, marking its return to the terminal since it moved out in 2009.
International flights.
There is separation between arriving and departing passengers within the International section, although the terminal was not originally built to cater for this separation. A new pier (the Europier) was added in the 1990s which increased the capacity of the terminal.
Terminal reorganisation.
oneworld.
Due to the construction of Terminal 5, most British Airways flights moved out of Terminal 1 to Terminal 5 during 2008. The remaining British Airways flights moved to Terminal 3 on 25 February 2009, later than originally planned.
Finnair, a member of the oneworld alliance, moved to Terminal 3 in January 2009, to join other oneworld carriers.
Since the buyout of British Midland International, British Airways service some Short-Haul and Medium-Haul destinations from this terminal, marking its return to the terminal since it moved out in 2008
Star Alliance.
Twelve members of the Star Alliance are based in Terminal 1 after the reorganization. Eight of them remain in Terminal 3, however, because of lack of space in Terminal 1 and because there are no stands in Terminal 1 for the A380 used by Singapore Airlines. TAM moved into Terminal 1 in March 2010. For the time being United Airlines flights to Houston and Newark will continue to use Terminal 4 until the new Terminal 2 is completed. These were formerly operated by Continental Airlines, which was part of the SkyTeam airline alliance when the 2009 reorganization was planned.
On 25 October 2009, Aegean Airlines moved its twice-daily Athens to London flights from London Stansted Airport to Heathrow Airport, using Terminal 1. Aegean Airlines joined Star Alliance in May 2010.
Other airlines.
Most non-allied airlines will move to London Heathrow Terminal 4, with the exception of Aer Lingus and Virgin Atlantic Little Red, who are due to move to Terminal 2 in 2014 (due to the requirement for domestic/Irish segregation currently not possible in Terminals 3 and 4)
Airlines and destinations.
In 2011 Terminal 1 handled 13.8 million passengers on 122,992 flights.
Ground transport.
Road links.
As part of the three central terminals at Heathrow, it is well linked to the M4 motorway via the M4 spur road and through a tunnel under the north runway. There is a short stay car park directly opposite the terminal and there is also a long stay car park on the Northern Perimeter Road by the northern entrance to the tunnel accessed by a shuttle bus service.
Rail links.
Terminal 1 is accessed by the London Underground from Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 tube station, with trains towards Cockfosters station via Central London. The Terminal is also accessed by Heathrow Connect and Express from Heathrow Central were services go to London Paddington. Heathrow Connect services are due to be replaced by Crossrail when it finally opens at some point in the future and services would be increased from 2 trains per hour (about every 30 minutes) to 4 trains per hour (about every 15 minutes).

Gargoyles (novel)

Gargoyles is one of Thomas Bernhard’s earliest novels, which made the author known both nationally and internationally. Originally published in German in 1967, it’s a kaleidoscopic work, considered by critics his most disquieting and nihilistic.
Plot summary.
The German title translates something like "Confusion" or "Disturbance", but the American publisher chose "Gargoyles", perhaps in order to render the array of human freaks the novel depicts to its very end. In fact, this is a singular, surreal study of the nature of humanity. 
One morning a doctor takes his son—an idealistic student of science and rationality—on his daily rounds through the grim mountainous Austrian countryside. They observe the rural grotesques they encounter—from an innkeeper whose wife has been murdered to a crippled musical prodigy kept in a cage—coping with physical misery, madness, and the brutality of the austere landscape. But when they meet the insomniac Prince Saurau in his castle at Hochgobernitz, his solitary, stationary mind takes over the rest of the novel in an uninterrupted obsessive paragraph. It's a hundred-page monologue by an eccentric, paranoid man, a relentlessly flowing cascade of words that is classic Bernhard: the furious logorrhea is a mesmeric rant, completing the stylistic formation of his art of exaggeration, where he uses metaphors of physical and mental illness to explore the decay of his homeland.
Imagery, style and themes.
Gargoyles is a dark, broken work, the first of Bernhard's novels to be translated and the first to gain him national recognition. The writing style is haunting and compulsive, the setting is the fairy-tale landscape of rural Austria, especially the area surrounding a remote mountain gorge. Then there is the Hochgobernitz castle, which seems to be taken right out of a Nosferatu movie. Its owner - old prince Saurau - is the expression of the best (or worst) Bernhardian values: the Habsburg stand-in who steals the show with a hundred-page monologue about his own descent into madness and his fraught relationship with his own son.
Bernhard shares with Kafka and Beckett the ability to extract more than utter gloom from his landscape of inconceivable devastation. While the external surface of life is unquestionably grim, he somehow suggests more – the mystic element in experience that calls for symbolic interpretation; the inner significance of states that are akin to surrealistic dream-worlds; man’s yearning for health, compassion, sanity.

LHC Les Lions

Lyon Hockey Club (LHC or The Lions) is the ice hockey team of Lyon, France. The team currently competes in the France's Division 2 ice hockey championship. Lyon finished in first place at the end of the 2007 regular season and was undefeated in the playoff series until the final game when the Nice Eagles defeated them on Lyon's home ice.
History.
1898-1953: Ice Hockey in Lyon.
Ice hockey was played in Lyon as early as 1898 on a rink located on the Boulevard des Belges where today the Guimet Museum stands. The Sporting Club de Lyon (Lyon Sporting Club) won the national Coupe Magnus title in 1905 and 1908 but the rink was converted to a museum in 1909 and Lyon was without a rink and a team for the next 44 years.[http://www.info-stades.net/infos/patinoire-charlemagne-77.php]
1953-1997: The CPL Era.
In 1953 the Club des Patineurs Lyonnais (Skating Club of Lyon or CPL) was founded and in 1956 the Lyon team won France's Division 1 ice hockey championship. In 1963 CPL built the Patinoire Charlemagne that still today serves as the home of Lyon ice sports. In their new home CPL won France's Division 2 ice hockey championship in both 1972 and 1989. Christophe Geoffroy's management forces the CPL to the liquidation in 1997
1997-2007: Lyon Hockey Club.
Following the collapse of CPL local businessman Christophe Geoffroy founded Hockey sur glace lyonnais Elite (Lyon Elite Ice Hockey). Teamed with the Lyon Hockey Club Association, an association charged with developing junior ice hockey, the Lyon Hockey Club was born. The new team experienced quick success and twice finished third in France's Ligue Magnus in 1997 and 1998. LHC qualified for Europe's Continental Cup in 1999 and reached the quarter finals before being eliminated.
By 2000 LHC had been relegated to France's Division 3 championship but quickly began to rise through national ranks again. In the 2001 season Lyon reached and won the Division 2 championship and earned a place in Division 1 for season 2002. A poor season in 2002 saw the team return to the second division once again and, despite reaching the final in 2007, LHC remains a Division 2 team in 2008.
2008 Season.
Lyon began the season with a trip to the Illberg Arena to face Mulhouse. Down a goal at the end of the first period, Mulhouse scored again and the Lions scored twice in the second to go into the final break all even. Both Mulhouse and Lyon scored once more in a hard fought final period before a goal to the LHC in the final seconds saw the Lions leave Illberg with their first win of the season.
Lyon welcomed Nantes to the Patinoire Charlemagne in the second round of the Southern Pool and stunned their opponents with a goal after only 28 seconds. A fiery first period ended with Lyon up 2-1 and the match remained scoreless until late in the third period where Lyon scored their third and final goal to win 3-1.
The Lions travelled to the Chambéry Métropole to face alpine rivals Chambéry. It was all even at the end of the first period (1-1) but the LHC added a goal in the second and two more in the third to walk away from the match with a clear 4-1 win.
Back in Lyon for a game against Font Romeu, the Lions went almost two periods before scoring. Just one goal in the second period and two more against a weakening Font Romeu in the third period saw the Lions win 3-0.
The fifth round of season 2008 saw Lyon welcome Cholet and the home team scored early to lead 1-0 after the first period. Both teams added one more goal in the second period and Cholet scored once more in the third to tie it all up. Undisciplined play in the final minutes, however, saw two Lions sent to the penalty box and the Cholet Dogs took advantage of their numbers to score the winning goal with two minutes to go. The defeat against Cholet was Lyon's first regular season loss at home in two seasons.
Game six of the season saw the Lions travel to Clermont and face the Boars. It took only a little more than three minutes for Lyon to open the scoring and, after an equaliser by Clermont, the Geoffrey Paillet scored again for the LHC to finish the first period ahead 2-1. Xavier Simoni scored quickly (33 seconds) into the second period and added another 10 minutes later before Clermont scored again, rounding out the second period to a 4-2 scoreline in favour of Lyon. A final period onslaught by the Lions saw five unanswered goals added (1 on power play, 3 in normal time and 1 while a man down) to give the LHC a 9-2 win and return them to the top of the Division 2 table.

<doc id="20093414" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20093414" title="Subwavelength-diameter optical fibre">
Subwavelength-diameter optical fibre

Subwavelength-diameter optical fibre (SDF or SDOF) is an optical fibre whose diameter is less than the wavelength of the light being propagated through the fibre. An SDOF usually consists of long thick parts (same as conventional optical fibres) at both ends, transition regions (tapers), where the fibre diameter gradually decreases down to the subwavelength value, and a subwavelength-diameter waist, which is the main acting part of an SDOF.
Name.
There is no general agreement on how these optical elements are to be called, different groups preferring to emphasize different properties of such fibres, sometimes even using different terms. The names in use include:
The term "waveguide" can be applied not only to fibres, but also to other waveguiding structures such as silicon photonic subwavelength waveguides. The term "submicron" is often synonymic to "subwavelength" in this case, taking into account that the majority of experiments are carried out with the light with the wavelength between 0.8 and 1.6 µm; however for other wavelengths this may not be true. All the names including the prefix "nano-" are somewhat misleading, since it is usually applied to objects with dimensions on the scale of nanometers or tens of nanometers (cf. nanoparticle, nanotechnology). The characteristic behaviour of the SDOF—high intensity of the electromagnetic field both inside and outside the fibre, maximum confinement of light in transversal cross-section—appears when the fibre diameter is about half of the wavelength of light. That is why the term "subwavelength" is the most appropriate for these objects.
SDF features.
High power in the evanescent field.
The main peculiarity of an SDF is that in the waist region, a significant part of the light's power propagates outside the fibre. Rigorously, this follows from the application of Maxwell's equations to a waveguide with circular cross-section. In a simplified way, this may be explained by the following. Light is guided in waveguides by total internal reflection (TIR) occurring on the interface between the waveguide and surrounding media. During TIR, the light intensity does not fall down to zero immediately at the interface, but decreases exponentially (vanishes) in the adjacent medium (the light field outside the waveguide is called the evanescent field). The depth of penetration of light during TIR depends on the exact configuration, but it is usually greater than or on the order of the wavelength of light.
An SDF has a diameter which is smaller than or on the order of the wavelength of light. Since an SDF is also a waveguide and thus light propagation is physically explained by the same fundamental reasons as TIR, the light, guided by an SDF, penetrates into surrounding media (air or vacuum) to the depth of about one wavelength or more. However, while in the case of conventional waveguides this depth is very small compared to the waveguide dimensions and so only a negligible amount of energy propagates outside the waveguide, in the case of SDF the volume occupied by the evanescent field is bigger than the volume of the SDF itself. Therefore the evanescent field of an SDF contains a significant portion of the whole light energy propagating along the fibre.
Manufacturing.
An SDF is usually created by tapering a commercial optical fibre. Special pulling machines accomplish the process.
An optical fibre usually consists of a core, a cladding and a protective coating. Before pulling a fibre, its coating is removed (the fibre is stripped). Then the bare fibre is fixed at two ends on the movable translation stages of the pulling machine. The middle of the fibre between the stages is then heated with a flame or a laser beam and at the same time the translation stages move in the opposite directions. The glass melts and the fibre is elongated so that its diameter decreases. The flame or laser beam usually also moves in order to obtain waist of significant length and constant thickness.
Using the described method, waists of 1...10 mm in length and diameters down to 100 nm are obtained.
Handling.
Being extremely thin, an SDF is also extremely fragile. Therefore, an SDF is usually mounted onto a special frame immediately after pulling and is never detached from this frame.
Another issue is dust particles which may adsorb to the surface of an SDF. If significant laser power is coupled into the fibre, dust particles will scatter light in the evanescent field, heat up and may thermally destroy the waist. In order to prevent this, SDF are pulled and used in dust-free environments such as flowboxes or vacuum chambers.
Light propagation in SDF.
Light propagation in an SDF is governed by different propagation equations as in a usual optical fibre. See and.

Shaukat Tarin

Shaukat Tarin (; born 1953) is a senior banker from Pakistan and former Finance Minister of Pakistan "(from 2009 to 2010)" in the Yousaf Raza Gillani-led government. 
On 7 October 2008, he was appointed adviser to the government and was elevated to the post of finance minister after being elected as a senator from Sindh on 27 July 2009. Tarin resigned from the ministry on February 23, 2010 to "raise equity from the market for Silkbank," which while working at finance ministry was "a clear conflict of interest."
Before his ministerial role, Tarin served as the country manager of Citibank and did tenures as head of Habib Bank, Union Bank, and twice as chairman of Karachi Stock Exchange. He currently sits on the board of Silk Bank.
Banking career.
Shaukat Tarin (also spelt 'Tareen') is an ethnic Pashtun born to an army doctor in Multan. He got his initial education from Army Cantonment schools all over Pakistan and later got his MBA from University of the Punjab. He joined Citibank in 1975 and remained with it for 22 years rising to become its country manager in Thailand.
In 1997, then-PM Nawaz Sharif asked Tarin to turn around state-owned Habib Bank, for which he left the $1 million plus job in the United States. He, along with Zubyr Soomro at United Bank and Muhammad Mian Soomro at National Bank of Pakistan, were "successful in bringing the nationalised commercial banks (NCBs) back from virtual extinction." 
He left HBL in 2000 to join Union Bank as its president. As the president of the Union Bank, Tarin was associated with the acquisition by Standard Chartered Bank of a 95.37% interest in Union Bank in September 2006. The amount paid was $487 million, in cash.

Robyn Parker

Robyn Mary Parker MP (born 3 August 1958), an Australian politician, is the New South Wales Minister for Environment and Minister for Heritage in the O'Farrell-Stoner Liberal/National coalitition government. Parker is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Maitland for the Liberal Party since 2011 and was previously a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales between 2003 and 2011.
Early years and background.
Parker was born to parents, Adeline and Campbell McEwen. Her family has its origins in the dairy farming district of Taranaki, New Zealand. She studied at the Palmerston North Teacher’s College at Massey University, New Zealand and obtained a Diploma of Teaching. She subsequently worked as a development officer with a focus on Children's Services for the City of Sunshine between 1979 and 1980; a Family Day Care Co-ordinator for the City of Oakleigh between 1981 and 1982, and for Queensland Centacare between 1982 and 1983. After moving to Maitland in the mid-1980s, she was the Co-ordinator of a mobile resource service between 1984 and 1995 and she also taught child studies for TAFE between 1985 to 1992. At Maitland she developed one of the first mobile community outreach programs for that city.
Her interest in politics became evident in 1999, when she became a political advisor to Senator John Tierney but left in November 2001 to become a manager at a skin cancer centre in Lake Macquarie. At the clinic she developed and implemented a program to encourage women to take leadership positions within politics, particularly the Liberal party. 
She is currently the Patron of Wesley Mission's Operation Hope.
Political career.
Ministerial Career.
As Minister for the Environment, Robyn Parker has sought to increase penalties for pollution and develop an independent Environment Protection Authority.
She pursued a science-based approach to recovery of threatened species and secured additional funding for these programs 
Legislative Council.
Parker was first touted as a Liberal candidate in 2000 However, she had to wait until 2002 to be pre-selected for the fifth position on the Liberal ticket, and was the seventh person elected on the combined Liberal/National ticket. 
In 2004 she spoke on the debate of the Criminal Procedure Amendment Sexual Offences Bill in the New South Wales Parliament. She supported the introduction of closed circuit television for victims to give their evidence in court as she had been a victim when she was nineteen in New Zealand. In the debate she pointed out the different standards that apply to rape victims compared to other victims of crime. She said that if "an assailant held you at knifepoint, asked you for your wallet and you complied, there is no question that a crime was committed. You would not be asked if you consented. You would not be asked if you had tried to resist. Only survivors of sexual assault are asked these questions." Following the disclosure, she was inundated with communications from victims who had also not disclosed their experiences saying that "I feel that at least I've been able to help effect some change."
Legislative Assembly.
On 19 February 2010, Parker was pre-selected by the Liberal Party to contest the semi-marginal Lower House seat of Maitland. At the 2011 election, Parker was elected with a swing of 20.3 per cent and won the seat with 56.3 per cent of the vote on a two-party preferred basis. Her main competitor was the incumbent sitting member, Labor's Frank Terenzini.
Personal life.
Parker is married to David and has three children Dylan, Chelsea and Heath and two stepchildren Ben and Tim. Her husband stood for the seat of Newcastle in the 2003 election. In 2009 it was revealed that Parker's eldest son, Dylan, then aged 22, makes and flies paper planes and he has become one of the world's best; whilst at the same time dealing with the sudden discovery of a brain tumour. His story was broadcast in an episode of the ABC TV program "Australian Story".

Hierarchical RBF

In computer graphics, a hierarchical RBF is an interpolation method based on Radial basis functions (RBF). Hierarchical RBF interpolation has applications in the construction of shape models in 3D computer graphics (see Stanford Bunny image below), treatment of results from a 3D scanner, terrain reconstruction and others.
This problem informally named "large scattered data point set interpolation".
The idea of method (for example in 3D) consists of the following:
formula_7 — it is RBF;
formula_8 — it is coefficients which are the solution of the system show on picture:
for determination of surface it is necessary to estimate the value of function formula_3 in interesting points "x".
A lack of such method is considerable complication formula_10 for calculate RBF, solve system and determine surface.
Hierarchical algorithm.
An idea of hierarchical algorithm is an acceleration of calculations due to decomposition of intricate problem on the great number of simple (see picture). 
In this case hierarchical division of space containing points on elementary parts, the system of small dimension solves in each of which. The calculation of surface in this case is taken to the hierarchical (on the basis of tree-structure) calculation of interpolant. A method for a 2D case is offered Pouderoux J. et al. For a 3D case a method is used in the tasks of 3D graphics by W. Qiang et al. and modified by Babkov V.

Occupational therapy in the United Kingdom

This article discusses occupational therapy (OT) in the United Kingdom.
Occupational therapy education in the UK.
Every year around 1,500 new students embark on training to become registered occupational therapists. To qualify as an occupational therapist one is required undertake an approved programme of study at one of the 31 UK universities offering occupational therapy education. There are a variety of full and part time programmes available in occupational therapy the UK, most are Bachelor of Science (with Honours) degrees; some are Postgraduate Diplomas, others are Master's degrees.
All programmes must be approved by the Health Professions Council (HPC) as meeting their minimum standards. This approval is mandatory in order for the graduates to be registered to practice. In contrast, accreditation is a voluntary process which confers further recognition of a programme by the College of Occupational Therapists (COT). Those universities that continue to be accredited have committed to working in partnership with the professional body (the COT) to maintain high standards of education and practice, and to steer the profession’s development within the UK and abroad.
The content of programmes varies but all combine both practice and academic study. Academic components may include anatomy and physiology, psychology and sociology, occupational therapy knowledge and skills, creative and management skills, therapeutic interventions, environmental adaptations and research methods and applications.
History of occupational therapy in the UK.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the establishment of public health measures to control infectious diseases included the building of fever hospitals. Patients with tuberculosis were recommended to have a regime of prolonged bed rest followed by a gradual increase in exercise. Dr Philip, a Scottish physician, prescribed graded activity from complete rest through to gentle exercise and eventually to activities such as digging, sawing, carpentry and window cleaning. During this period a farm colony near Edinburgh and a village settlement near Papworth in Cambridgeshire were established, both of which aimed to employ people in appropriate long-term work prior to their return to open employment. 
During and after the First World War, casualties amongst young men resulted in an acute shortage of manpower in the workforce. The need to re-establish these men in open employment facilitated the growth of OT in the treatment of those with physical disabilities. Curative workshops were opened within military hospitals, based on similar workshops already established in the United States, and were equipped with tools and machinery to exercise joints and muscles. Based on these workshops the first occupational therapy department in Scotland was opened in 1936 at the Astley Ainslie Institution in Edinburgh, where at the same time the first Occupational Therapy Training Centre was opened. 
Margaret Barr Fulton MBE 1900-1989 or Peg Fulton, as she was known, became the first occupational therapist to work in the United Kingdom in 1925. She qualified at the Philadelphia School in the United States and was appointed to the Aberdeen Royal Hospital for mental patients where she worked until her retirement in 1963. During that time, she gained an international reputation for her department and for her part in the development of both the Scottish Association (SAOT) and the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT). OT was introduced into England by Dr Elizabeth Casson who had visited similar establishments in America. In 1929 she established her own residential clinic in Bristol, Dorset House, for ‘women with mental disorders’, and worked as its medical director. It was here in 1930 that she founded the first school of occupational therapy in the UK, Dorset House, The Promenade, Clifton. Its first Principal was Constance Tebbit (later Owens) who returned from training as an occupational therapist in Philadelphia to take up her post. She later went on to set up the Liverpool School of Occupational Therapy. She opened Dorset House School of Occupational Therapy in Bristol in 1930. Her interest in occupational therapy continued with involvement in the Association of Occupational Therapists (AOT), established in 1936. The Second World War added impetus to the development of occupational therapy as the profession played a vital role in the rehabilitation and re-establishment of wounded soldiers into the workforce.
Why are occupational therapists interested in occupation?
Occupational therapists work from an understanding that there is a relationship between the things that people do and their health and well-being 
This is a list of some of the characteristics of occupations, as discussed in literature in the last decade.
• Occupations are activities both meaningful and purposeful to the individual performing them 
• They also usually have sociocultural meaning 
• Occupations fill and structure time 
• They tend to be grouped according to purpose: self-care, leisure and productivity (or work)
• They support roles and participation in society 
• Occupations contribute to the individual’s sense of identity 
• Activities are not occupations if they are involuntary, or if they are aimed at a goal which does not involve individual meaning and participation 
It has been suggested that occupation can be defined simply as ‘doing, being and becoming’, a simple definition which captures the notion of subjectively meaningful activity which results in some kind of transformation in the ‘doer’. 
The word ‘occupation’ has a relatively precise usage in the fields of occupational therapy and occupational science but other disciplines (such as anthropology, psychology, leisure studies) have an interest in the human activities. It can be argued that all activities are meaningful, given that they are socially situated, symbolic constructs, and so the understanding of an activity as an occupation rests, perhaps on personal meaningfulness.
Professional Organisations.
The British Association and College of Occupational Therapists (BAOT/COT) is the professional body for Occupational Therapy staff in the United Kingdom.

Conjunto histórico

In Spain, the legal designation Conjunto histórico (formerly "Conjunto Histórico-Artístico" or "Historic-Artistic Grouping") is part of the national system of heritage listing. It is applied to buildings in a given locality.
It is typically used to protect complete villages, such as Peñaranda de Duero, or historic quarters of towns such as Avilés.
"Conjunto" means "group", and as a group listing, the "Conjunto histórico" is comparable with the British concept of a Conservation Area. 
"Conjunto histórico" is a sub-category within a broader category of "Bien de Interés Cultural", which protects Spain's cultural heritage and is regulated by the country's Ministry of Culture. As well as "conjuntos históricos", the category of "Bien de Interés Cultural" includes the following sub-categories of non-movable heritage:
A "Conjunto histórico" may include buildings which are individually protected as monuments, as is the case at, for example, Peñaranda de Duero or Covarrubias.

Spartan Constitution

The Spartan Constitution, or Politeia, refers to the government and laws of the Dorian city-state of Sparta from the time of Lycurgus, the legendary law-giver, to the incorporation of Sparta into the Roman Empire: approximately the 8th century BC to the 2nd century BC, Every city-state of Greece had a politeia at all times of its sovereign life, including the preceding Achaean Sparta and the subsequent Roman Sparta. The politeia of Dorian Sparta, however, was noted by many classical authors for its unique features, which supported a rigidly layered social system and a strong military.
Development of Spartan society.
The Dorian affiliation.
Spartan society prided itself on being members of a broad ethnic group termed the Dorians, Dōrieis, in their language. This ethnic group self-identified on family and tribal tradition but also was identifiable by the Dorian dialect it spoke. For example, where the Athenian population called itself the dēmos in the Attic-Ionic dialect, the Spartan word was Dāmos, retaining the long a prevalent in an earlier stage of Greek. On the whole Dorian states everywhere could count on mutual identification and support.
Cultural supersession in the mid-Eurotas valley.
Ancient Greece, or Hellas, had two non-continuous periods of native literacy: one, dated approximately 1400 BC-1200 BC, falling within the Late Bronze Age, or Mycenaean Period and the other, beginning with the innovation of the Greek alphabet about 775 BC, within the Iron Age. From the earlier period only diurnal administrative records survive in a syllabary called Linear B. They were in a dialect called variously Mycenaean Greek or Achaean, the ancestor of the Attic-Ionic dialect. After 775 alphabetic inscriptions of all sorts began to appear: tombstones, laws, decrees, making possible analysis of their dialects.
To date only fragments of three Linear B inscriptions have turned up in Laconia, at Agios Vasileios. A few words survive, such as e-pi-zo-ta, "short swords," nothing to distinguish them from the other Linear B tablets. The earliest inscriptions from Sparta are a dedication by one Deinis "to Helen wife of Menelaos" on a meathook and writing on a jar dated by style to about 650 BC, both found at the Menelaion, a shrine to Helen at the site of ancient Therapne across the river from Sparti.
All the evidence points to a Mycenaean Greek occupation of major Mycenaean sites; that is, walled cities on high places, citadels with cyclopean walls, palaces or villas featuring a megaron, Linear B tablets, large storage jars and other appropriate Late Bronze Age pottery. The central Eurotas valley has two candidates for the capital of the Atreid state: the citadel at Pellana and the Bronze Age town with villas on Menelaon Hill in Therapnes. The latter has the advantage of being the site of a shrine to Helen and Menelaus. The circumstantial evidence all points to an occupation of the Eurotas valley by Achaeans. If any Dorians were present they left no trace.
Therapne appears to have been abandoned or reduced to a small population at the end of the Bronze Age. A dark age ensued; evidently the administrations that employed Linear B scribes were not present in that capacity any longer. When alphabetic literacy appeared, the population employing it was Dorian. A remnant of the Achaeans comprised the population of Arcadia. Their dialect, Arcadian, with that of Cyprus (Arcado-Cypriote) is the closest of the dialects to Mycenaean Greek. The Dorians that now occupied the valley had superseded the Mycenaean Greeks.
The newly ascendant population of Sparta identified with other traditions than the ones associated with Mycenaean Greece. They had come, they believed, from central and northern Greece. As allies of the Heracleidae they had fought their way into southern Greece and gone on to Crete and the islands. Their tradition was that of warriors. They valued instant readiness for battle above all else. Escaping from them the Mycenaean Greeks had abandoned their homes to go into exile in Athens and then on to augment the colonies on the coast of Asia Minor as Ionians.
Beyond these circumstances no evidence for the entry of Dorians into the Peloponnesus exists. The association of the destruction of Mycenaean palaces with a "Dorian invasion" is somewhat strained by the compression of events requiring decades into a month or two in a single spring season. And yet, there is no question that Dorian culture superseded Mycenaean culture in the Eurotas valley. This circumstance requires either an invasive population or a revolution of a hitherto unknown and unattested resident population. The Spartan constitution recognizing a socially layered society hints very strongly that this layering came about through invasion and resistance. If that is true, then the Spartan constitution is native to Sparta and did not exist as such elsewhere.
The act of foundation.
Laws of Lycurgus.
The Spartans had no historical records, literature, or written laws, which were, according to tradition, expressly prohibited by an ordinance of Lycurgus, excluding the Great Rhetra.
Issuance of coinage was forbidden. Spartans were obliged to use iron obols (bars or spits), meant to encourage self-sufficiency and discourage avarice and the hoarding of wealth. A Spartan citizen in good standing was one who maintained his fighting skills, showed bravery in battle, ensured that his farms were productive, was married and had healthy children. Spartan women were the only Greek women to hold property rights on their own, and were required to practice sports before marriage. Although they had no formal political rights, they were expected to speak their minds boldly and their opinions were heard.
Structure of Spartan society and government.
Spartan society can be represented by a three-layer pyramid ruled by the government.
Society.
Spartiates.
Not all inhabitants of the Spartan state were considered citizens (part of the "Damos"). Only those who had successfully undertaken military training, called the agoge, were eligible. However, usually the only people eligible to receive the agoge were Spartiates, or people who could trace their ancestry to the original inhabitants of the city although there were two exceptions. "Trophimoi" or "foster sons" were foreign teenagers invited to study. This was meant as a supreme honor. The pro-Spartan Athenian magnate Xenophon sent his two sons to Sparta for their education as "trophimoi". Alcibiades, being an Alcmaeonid and thus a member of a family with old and strong connections to Sparta, was admitted as a "trophimos" and famously excelled in the "agoge" as well as otherwise (he was rumoured to have seduced one of the two queen consorts with his exceptional looks). The other exception was that sons of helots could be enrolled as "syntrophoi" (comrades, literally "the ones fed, or reared, together") if a Spartiate formally adopted him and paid his way. If a "syntrophos" did exceptionally well in training, he might be sponsored to become a Spartiate himself. A free-born Spartan who had successfully completed the "agoge" became a "peer" (ὅμοιος, "hómoios", literally "similar") with full civil rights at the age of 20, and remained one as long as he could contribute his equal share of grain to the common military mess in which he was obliged to dine every evening for as long as he was battle-worthy (usually until the age of 60). This was meant as assurance that every peer took good care of his estates and patrimony. Such "hómoioi" were also required to sleep in the barracks until the age of 30, regardless of whether they were married or not.
Perioeci.
Others in the state were the perioeci, who can be described as civilians.
Helots.
Helots were the state-owned serfs who made up 90 percent of the population. They were citizens of conquered states, such as Messina (Conquered for their fertile land) during the First Messianic War.
Government.
The Doric state of Sparta, copying the Doric Cretans, instituted a mixed governmental state: it was composed of elements of monarchical, oligarchical, and democratic systems. Isocrates refers to the Spartans as "subject to an oligarchy at home, to a kingship on campaign" (iii. 24).
Dual Kingship.
The state was ruled by two hereditary kings of the Agiad and the Eurypontid families, both descendants of Heracles and equal in authority so that one could not act against the power and political enactments of his colleague, though the Agiad king received greater honour by virtue of seniority of his family for being the "oldest extant" (Herod. vi. 5).
There are several legendary explanations for this unusual dual kingship, which differ only slightly; for example, that King Aristodemus had twin sons, who agreed to share the kingship, and this became perpetual. Modern scholars have advanced various theories to account for the anomaly. Some theorize that this system was created in order to prevent absolutism, and is paralleled by the analogous instance of the dual consuls of Rome. Others believe that it points to a compromise arrived at to end the struggle between two families or communities. Other theories suggest that this was an arrangement that was met when a community of villages combined to form the city of Sparta. Subsequently the two chiefs from the largest villages became kings. Another theory suggests that the two royal houses represent respectively the Spartan conquerors and their Achaean predecessors: those who hold this last view appeal to the words attributed by Herodotus (v. 72) to Cleomenes I: "I am no Dorian, but an Achaean"; although this is usually explained by the (equally legendary) descent of Aristodemus from Heracles. Either way, kingship in Sparta was hereditary and thus every king Sparta had was a descendant of the Agiad and the Eurypontid families. Accession was given to the male child who was first born after a king's accession.
The duties of the kings were primarily religious, judicial, and militaristic. They were the chief priests of the state, and performed certain sacrifices and also maintained communication with the Delphic sanctuary, which always exercised great authority in Spartan politics. In the time of Herodotus (about 450 BC), their judicial functions had been restricted to cases dealing with heiresses, adoptions and the public roads. Civil cases were decided by the ephors, and criminal jurisdiction had been passed to the ephors, as well as to a council of elders. By 500 BC the Spartans had become increasingly involved in the political affairs of the surrounding city-states, often putting their weight behind pro-Spartan candidates. Shortly before 500 BC, as described by Herodotus, such an action fueled a confrontation between Sparta and Athens, when the two kings, Demaratus and Cleomenes, took their troops to Athens. However, just before the heat of battle, King Demaratus changed his mind about attacking the Athenians and abandoned his co-king. For this reason, Demaratus was banished, and eventually found himself at the side of Persian King Xerxes for his invasion of Greece twenty years later (480 BC), after which the Spartans enacted a law demanding that one king remain behind in Sparta while the other commanded the troops in battle.
Aristotle describes the kingship at Sparta as "a kind of unlimited and perpetual generalship" (Pol. iii. I285a), Here also, however, the royal prerogatives were curtailed over time. Dating from the period of the Persian wars, the king lost the right to declare war, and was accompanied in the field by two ephors. He was supplanted also by the ephors in the control of foreign policy. Over time, the kings became mere figureheads except in their capacity as generals. Real power was transferred to the ephors and to the gerousia.
Ephors.
The ephors, chosen by popular election from the whole body of citizens, represented a democratic element in the constitution.
After the ephors were introduced, they, together with the two kings, were the executive branch of the state. Ephors themselves had more power than anyone in Sparta, although the fact that they only stayed in power for a single year reduced their ability to conflict with already established powers in the state. Since reelection was not possible, an ephor who abused his power, or confronted an established power center, would have to suffer retaliation. Although the five ephors were the only officials with regular legitimization by popular vote, in practice they were often the most conservative force in Spartan politics.
Gerousia.
The difference with today's states is that Sparta had a special policy maker, the gerousia, a council consisting of 28 elders over the age of 60, elected for life and usually part of the royal households, and the two kings. High state policy decisions were discussed by this council who could then propose action alternatives to the "Damos".
Apella.
The collective body of Spartan citizenry would select one of the alternatives by voting. Unlike most Greek "poleis", the Spartan citizen assembly could neither set the agenda of issues to be decided, nor debate them, merely vote on the alternatives presented to them. Neither could foreign embassies or emissaries address the assembly; they had to present their case to the Gerousia, which would then consult with the Ephors. Sparta considered all discourse from outside as a potential threat and all other states as past, present, or future enemies, to be treated with caution in the very least, even when bound with alliance treaties.

Church of St Martin, Callosa de Segura

The Arciprestal Church of St Martin Obispo is a church in Callosa de Segura, Alicante, Spain. It is a historic monument.
It was built in the 16th century and is an example of a Renaissance hall-church, with a nave and two aisles of equal height with vaults resting on tall classical columns, responding to a model completely alien to the Valencian world. The main facade belongs to the late Gothic style, adorned with archivolts, on which is inscribed (in Latin) "This is the House of God, this is the Gate of Heaven". In the 17th century a belfry was built (with five bells, named - from the highest to lowest - la Martina, la Purísima, San José, Sagrado Corazón and Santísimo Sacramento) was added. In the 18th century Rococo interior decoration and an enormous internal central cupola were added, and the Sacristy and Chapel of the Communion were added in that century in the Neoclassical style.
Inside the church are important jewelled works by Miguel de Vera (16th century), such as an image-reliquary of Saint Martin, the Archprestal cross and the Processional Crook, as well as passiflora sculptures and contemporary altarpieces by Rabasa, Noguera, etc.

Lévy family of graphs

In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a Lévy family of graphs is a family of graphs "G""n", "n" = 1, 2, 3, ..., which possess a certain type of "compactness" or "tangledness". Many naturally occurring families of graphs are Lévy families. Many mathematicians have noted this fact and have expressed surprise that it does not appear to have a ready explanation. 
Formally, a family of graphs "Gn", "n" = 1, 2, 3, ..., is a Lévy family if, for any formula_1
where
Here "D" is the graph diameter of "G", and "A"("n") is the "n"-graph neighborhood of "A". Note that the maximization ranges over subsets "A" of "G", subject to "A" being over half the size of "G"
In words, this means that one can take a subset of size at least half of "G", and blow it up by only formula_4 of the graph diameter, and end up with nearly all the set. 
Long "stringy" (i.e. not "compact") families of graphs such as the cyclic graph of order "n" clearly don't have such a property: one could consider a subset comprising the "n/2" neighborhood of a point (midnight to six o'clock, say). The graph has graph diameter "D" of about "n/2". So the formula_5-neighborhood of the subset is only of size about "n/2". A Levy family would have this neighborhood covering almost all the set. It should be clear that a Levy family must have a very special type of compact structure.

Norton (South Yorkshire) railway station

Norton (South Yorkshire) railway station was a railway station to serve Norton, South Yorkshire, England. It was built by the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway line between Doncaster and Knottingley. The line and its stations were absorbed into the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1847 when that company changed its name from the Manchester and Leeds Railway.
The station buildings were similar to those at Womersley and were described as "Swiss Cottage" style. They are a stone built construction with a clipped gable end.
At the grouping it passed to the LMS and British Railways on nationalisation. The station closed to passengers in September 1948. But the railway line is still open and now carries freight trains (mainly bulk coal) to and from the power stations at Drax, Ferrybridge & Eggborough, along with Grand Central's passenger services between Bradford Interchange and London Kings Cross since 2010.
As part of a report to Doncaster Borough Council in September 2008 the station site was to be protected for future use in a strategy for the railways in the borough, reopening being a distant possibility.

<doc id="20094071" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20094071" title="Mayadunne of Sitawaka">
Mayadunne of Sitawaka

Mayadunne () (1501–1581) was a king of the Kingdom of Sitawaka, who ruled for 60 years between 1521 and 1581. Mayadunne was a fierce opponent of the Portuguese, who had arrived on the Island in 1505. He devoted his whole life attempting to oust his brother Bhuvanekabahu, the king of Kotte and thereby preserve the independence of Lanka, which was being undermined by the Portuguese intrigue. He constantly invaded the territory of Bhuvanekabahu of Kotte.
Early life.
Mayadunne was born in 1501 in Kotte of the Kingdom of Kotte. He was the son of Vijaya Bahu VII who reigned as king from 1509 to 1521. Mayadunne was the youngest child born to Vijaya Bahu VII and his main Queen. He had two full brothers, Bhuvanekabahu and Raigama Bandara, Bhuvanekabahu who was also king of Kotte from 1521 to 1551.
Wijayaba Kollaya.
In 1521 together with his two full brothers Bhuvanekabahu and Raigama Bandara, who were born to the main queen of Vijaya Bahu VII, he revolted against his father, suspecting him of planning to pass the throne of Kotte to one of Vijaya Bahu VII's other queen's sons (Devaraja) after his death. Although Mayadunne was the youngest of the three brothers he was the mastermind behind this revolt which ended with the death of their father Vijaya Bahu VII (he was assassinated by a hired foreigner) and the Kotte Kingdom was divided between the three brothers. This incident is known as "Wijayaba Kollaya" and can roughly be translated as the "Spoiling of Vijayabahu". Bhuvanekabahu came to power as Bhuvanekabahu VII of Sri Lanka and he got established in the Kotte Kingdom with a region roughly including present day Colombo, Gampaha, Districts, North Western Province and Southern Province coastline. Raigama Bandara got established in Raigama with his control roughly over present day Kalutara District & Southern Province except the coastilne (which was under Kotte Kingdom). Mayadunne got established in the Kingdom of Sitawaka (Present day Avissawella) controlling roughly the modern day Sabaragamuwa Province (Kegalle, Ratnapura Districts).
Reign.
Since Mayadunne was the main actor during the rebellion against their father, Bhuvanekabahu VII was from the beginning suspicious of him and developed close ties with the Portuguese who had established a fort in Colombo (1517). Before long Mayadunne got popular support from the local chiefs and population who didn't like Bhuvanekabahu VII collaborating with Portuguese. Mayadunne led several invasion against Kotte but Bhuvanekabahu VII was able to drive Sitawakan forces back with the help of Portuguese. During the first phase of these battles Mayadunne was helped by an anti-Portuguese Kingdom in Calicut, India. The Portuguese wanted to kill Mayadunne fearing one day he will become a greater threat to their foothold on the Island but Bhuvanekabahu VII didn't let them to conduct an all out invasion against Sitawaka.
Several years later after Raigam Bandara died, in 1538, Mayadunne annexed the Kingdom of Raigama to Sitawaka. The all out rivalry between Sitawaka and Kotte started to unroll here on. By this time the Buddhist monks in Kotte who were responsible of the Dantha Dhathuwa, the Sacred Tooth Relic of Buddha, secretly smuggled it into Sitawaka and placed it under the protection of Mayadunne since they saw Portuguese as hostile towards Buddhism. According to the local tradition if someone has the ownership of the Tooth Relic he can claim the throne of all the Kingdoms within Sri Lanka. Mayadunne's popularity grew rapidly among locals and similarly Bhuvanekabahu VII of Kotte and later Dharmapala of Kotte had to rely more and more on Portuguese for help. Mayadunne started frequent attacks against the Kotte Kingdom and more and more of the lands of Kotte became part of Sitawaka. Since Kotte lacked local support the Portuguese automatically became the protectors of that Kingdom. Hence the rivalry between Kotte and Sitawaka turned into a rivalry between Sitawaka and Portuguese.
Sinhalese–Portuguese War.
Mayadunne and the Kingdom of Sitawaka was a part of the Sinhalese–Portuguese War, which was an effort to get rid of the occupying Portuguese forces and stop them from colonizing the island. At the time, it was the worst ever defeat by a colonial power on eastern soil. Mayadunne and his son Rajasigha fought the Portuguese in the Battle of Mulleriyawa and won, where the Kingdom of Sitawaka emerged all-powerful, able to challenge the Portuguese, who lost the opportunity to ensure their total control of the island.
Death and Legacy.
Due to the fact that he stood against Portuguese invaders and stopping them from conquering the whole island, Mayadunne is considered one of the greatest kings of Sri Lanka. He died at the ripe age of 80 years in 1581.

Laser-heated pedestal growth

Laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) or laser floating zone (LFZ) is a crystal growth technique. The technique can be viewed as a miniature floating zone, where the heat source is replaced by a powerful CO2 or YAG laser. Among all the modern techniques for growing crystals from the melt (liquid/solid phase transition), it has become one of the most powerful for materials research.
The geometric shape of the crystals (the technique can produce small diameters), and the low production cost, make the single-crystal fibers (SCF) produced by LHPG suitable substitutes for bulk crystals in many devices, especially those that use high melting point materials. However, single-crystal fibers must have equal or superior optical and structural qualities compared to bulk crystals to substitute for them in technological devices. This can be achieved by carefully controlling the growth conditions. 
Until 1980, laser-heated crystal growth used only two laser beams focused over the source material. This condition generated a high radial thermal gradient in the molten zone, making the process unstable. Increasing the number of beams to four did not solve the problem, although it improved the growth process. The largest improvement to the laser-heated crystal growth technique was made by Fejer "et al.", who incorporated a special optical component known as a "reflaxicon", consisting of an inner cone surrounded by a larger coaxial cone section, both with reflecting surfaces. This optical element converts the cylindrical laser beam into a larger diameter hollow cylinder surface. This optical component allows radial distribution of the laser energy over the molten zone, reducing radial thermal gradients. The axial temperature gradient in this technique can go as high as 10000 °C/cm, which is very high when compared to traditional crystal growth techniques (10–100 °C/cm).
Another interesting feature of the LHPG technique is its high convection speed in the liquid phase due to Marangoni convection. The video presented in the following reference shows the liquid phase convection during lithium niobate (LiNbO3) fiber pulling using a very small piece of platinum wire inside the liquid that is allowed to spin. It is possible to see that it spins very fast. Even when it appears to be standing still, it is in fact spinning fast on its axis.

B. F. Gribble

B. F. (Bernard Finegan) Gribble RBC SMA (10 May 1872 - 21 February 1962) was a prolific British marine artist and illustrator.
Life and works.
Gribble was born in Chelsea in 1872. His father Herbert A. K. Gribble ARIBA was an architect known for his design of the Brompton Oratory. Gribble was set to follow in his father's footsteps, but elected to become a full-time painter in oils and watercolours. He was educated at the College of St Francis Saviour, Bruges, Belgium; South Kensington Art School and under Albert Toft. He married Eleanor Mabel Clunn (Nellie). They settled in Poole, Dorset, some time between 1915 and 1924 (or perhaps in the 1930s), living at 3 Springfield Crescent, Parkstone. He became a member — along with Henry Lamb and Augustus John — of the Poole and East Dorset Art Society.
Although his work included landscapes of Poole and portraits, Gribble was best known as a painter of historical (and often romanticised) maritime scenes. It was once suggested that he had painted "almost every historic event that took place on water, from the landing of William the Conqueror to the Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow in 1919". Spanish galleons and treasure vessels are well represented in his work, and one critic described him as a "specialist in burning ships". Others compared his paintings to the fine marine vistas of the late 19th-century seascape artist, Henry Moore, acknowledging his skill in the accurate portrayal of costume and technical detail and his ability to convey an authentic period atmosphere.(1)
In his preparatory sketches of ships, Gribble made notes on the precise structure and names of sails, masts and rigging, He had studied the movement of water closely, and made highly technical analyses of the construction of rigging and sails to a level where it naturally informed his naval subjects. He also paid close attention to the detail of costume. The evident quality of Gribble's marine pictures lies in the artist's mastery of the oil painting medium adapted to a profound understanding of his chosen subject.(2)
Gribble exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy and the Paris Salon and his paintings were widely sought. Franklin D. Roosevelt was one of many celebrity owners of Gribble paintings.He purchased a painting showing the arrival of American destroyers at Queenstown in Ireland, during World War I. It hung in the Oval Office of the White House when Roosevelt became United States President in 1933. The President reputedly suggested the painting's name —"The Return of the Mayflower" — to the artist. Roosevelt also purchased "Surrender of the German Fleet to the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow". Gribble had been one of the few civilian witnesses to this event in 1918; in his capacity as Official Maritime Painter to the Shipwrights' Company. Both works are believed to have been painted in 1919.(3)
Other notable purchasers of Gribble paintings included Queen Mary, the German Kaiser and the late Jackie Onassis. The Kaiser was so impressed by his work that King George V summoned the artist to a royal residence to meet him. 
Gribble was in demand as an illustrator and his work appeared in many leading magazines, including The Illustrated London News and The Graphic, He illustrated numerous books, his work appearing even on royal postcards and chocolate boxes.
After his death in 1962, his widow donated many of his works to Poole Museum, which now boasts the world's largest collection of Gribble paintings. The collection numbers 250 paintings, drawings, prints and photographs. Typical paintings in the Poole collection are "The Plague Ship", "The Whelp of the Black Rover" and "The Return of the Argosy Galleons", but there are also some local topographical works such as the Guildhall, the Custom House, views of the Quay and harbour, a portrait of former Mayor of Poole, Herbert Carter, in civic regalia and one of a woman believed to be his wife Nellie.
Although Gribble's work has been out of fashion for some decades, Poole Museum has taken the opportunity provided by the First World War Centenary to reassess Gribble's art by staging an exhibition of his marine paintings, based on its collection and focusing on his war paintings. Part of the national centenary programme led by Imperial War Museums, the exhibition also includes loans from private and public collections, including the National Maritime Museum, and the highlight of these is a painting of the scuttling of the German Fleet at Scapa Flow, of which Gribble was an eye witness, from the Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston. The exhibition, titled Painting Drama at Sea, continues until February 2014.
B. F. Gribble is buried with his wife in Parkstone Cemetery, Poole, Dorset. They had no children.

ABS Hovercraft

ABS Hovercraft is a British hovercraft designer and producer, founded in the early 90's.
History.
ABS Hovercraft researched the introduction of new materials to innovate Hovercraft technology.
In 1993 ABS created the world’s fastest recreational Hovercraft fully made from advanced composite materials.
In 1994 ABS launched the largest Hovercraft entirely made from advanced composite materials, called the ABS M10, which was built by Vosper Thornycroft in Southampton. The M10 crossed the English Channel and was the first hovercraft to circumnavigate the Baltic Sea during winter trials in 1994.
In 1995 their ABS M10 was sold to a commercial operator, Eurosense, in Belgium as a replacement for an SR-N6 for use as a hydrographical survey vessel along the coastline off Zeebrugge. Other ABS M10 hovercraft were sold as logistic supply vessels to the Sri-Lanka Navy and to the Swedish Amphibious Corps, produced under license by Kockums AB of Sweden.
In 1998 Tony Blair announced on TV the Millennium Product award of the UK Design Council for the ABS M10 Hovercraft.
Models.
So far ABS has concentrated on larger Hovercraft that can carry up to 100 passengers as ferry or more than 10 tons of disposable payload for military, paramilitary or commercial applications. Their vessels can be used as commercial ferry or for cargo operations, as a work boat or for logistic supply in arduous environments. 
Their technology is licensed to a number of international shipyards. 
Currently the ABS Hovercraft now known as the ABS M-10 is being built under license by ABS under the name "EPS M-10" by EPS Corporation of Tinton Falls, NJ.
The EPS M-10 has the following specifications
Length: 20.6 m

Red flour beetle

The red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) is a species of beetle in the family Tenebrionidae, the darkling beetles. It is a worldwide pest of stored products, particularly food grains, and a model organism for ethological and food safety research.
The red flour beetle attacks stored grain and other food products, including flour, cereals, pasta, biscuits, beans, and nuts, causing loss and damage. It may cause an allergic response but is not known to spread disease or cause damage to structures or furniture. 
The red flour beetle is of Indo-Australian origin and less able to survive outdoors than the closely related species "Tribolium confusum", the confused flour beetle. It has, as a consequence, a more southern distribution, though both species are worldwide in heated environments. The adult is long-lived, sometimes living more than three years. Although previously regarded as a relatively sedentary insect, it has been shown in molecular and ecological research to disperse considerable distances by flight.
This species closely resembles the confused flour beetle, except with three clubs at the end of each of its antennae.

HMS Virulent (P95)

HMS "Virulent" (P95) was a V-Class submarine of the Royal Navy. She was built during the Second World War as part of the second batch (18 in number) of V-Class Submarines ordered on 21 May 1942.
She was built by Vickers-Armstrong (Newcastle-on-Tyne), being laid down on 30 March 1943, launched on 23 May 1944, and finally commissioned on 1 October 1944.
Fate.
"Virulent" was lent to the Hellenic Navy as "Argonaftis" (U15) from 29 May 1946 until 3 October 1958. She was intended to be towed from Malta to the River Tyne. She broke adrift from the tow on 15 December 1958 and was stranded on the northern Spanish coast. She was then found and towed by two Spanish trawlers and the destroyer "Hernán Cortez" to Pasajes on 6 January 1959. Sold to Spanish scrap merchants in spring 1961, she was eventually scrapped in April 1961 at Pasajes.

Foreign policy of Evo Morales

The foreign policy of Evo Morales concerns the policy initiatives made towards other states by the current President of Bolivia, in difference to past, or future, Bolivian foreign policy. Morales' foreign policy can be roughly divided between that of the Americas (led by the United States) and the rest of the world.
World tour.
From December 29, 2005, Evo Morales undertook an international tour described by Latin American media as exceptional. For two weeks, Morales visited several countries in search of political and economic support for his agenda for the transformation of Bolivia.
This tour is said to have constituted a break with decades of tradition in which the first international destination visited by a president-elect in Bolivia was the United States. His itinerary also reinforced the view that his election was part of a strengthening of "anti-imperialist" governments and movements in Latin America.
In September 2006, he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, holding a coca leaf, saying:
In September, 2007, Morales appeared on "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart". There he discussed various political issues. Morales was only the second sitting head of state to appear on the show and the first to be interviewed on the show using a translator.
On April 28, 2008, again he addressed the United Nations at the inauguration of the UN's VII Indigenous Forum UNPFII - United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, with his proposed 10 Commandments to save the Planet, summarized as:
Relations with other South American governments.
A further boost with grassroots cross-South American support came when social organizations meeting in Lima supported Bolivia's negative by Colombia and Peru to bypass collective bargaining with the European Union. La Prensa, El Diario and La Razon reported that the leaders of 15 groups from Bolivia, Peru and Colombia summoned mobilizations demanding that agreements with the EU be negotiated as a bloc and that the association of the Community of Andean Nations be respected. They demanded a popular referendum be conducted in each of the four countries. The first such action of protest would be carried out in Lima, with other measures being coordinated for December. The said organizations also gave support to Bolivia for not having given up to transnationals the negotiation on strategic topics such as the national control over foreign investments and other issues.
UNASUR.
Following the September 11, 2008 massacre in the northern department of Pando, an emergency meeting of the regional grouping UNASUR was called in Santiago, Chile. On September 15, 2008, the 12 countries that make up UNASUR declared their unanimous support for the government of Evo Morales and condemned attempts by the opposition to destabilise the country and attempt a "civil coup" by occupying public buildings.
OAS.
As the date for the referundum on a new constition approached, Morales asked members of the OAS to send election observers and to help with the repecussions to the vote for a new constitution. He said that he was "not too worried about the approval, but I'm concerned about the implementation."
Brazil.
Brazil and Bolivia have been working on expanding and diversifying trade between the two countries in the last quarter of 2008. The 6th Meeting of the Commission for Monitoring Brazil-Bolivia trade was used to this end. As it stood, at the time Brazil was the main destination for exports from Bolivia, having bought, in 2007, 35.7% of the products that Bolivian companies sell to other countries. They were also the main exporter to Bolivia, sending 24.7% of products imported into Bolivia. As industrialized products represented 94.6% of Brazilian sales up to September of the year, Bolivian sales in the same period were limited largely to natural gas, which accounted for up to 92.7% of the total purchased from the country, or US$1.89 billion. The products with the greatest scope for an increase in trade from Brazil to Bolivia were crude oil, insecticides, aircraft, vehicle engines, soy in grain, vegetable oils and ironworks products, amongst others. From Bolivia to Brazil, producs such as animal feed, vegetable oil, crude oil, tin, ores of precious metals, precious gems, dried and fresh fruit, plants, leather and garments were also capable of seeing sales grow.
Venezuela.
Venezuelan relations with Bolivia were largely centered around personal relations with the Leftist leaders of the region. Hugo Chavez strongly supported Morales when he came under attack from the elite in the east of his country and the United States.
Following the rift with the United States, Venezuela came to Bolivia's rescue to double the country's textile exports from what it was selling to the U.S. under an agreement for lax duties that Washington suspended for the ceasure of support in the war on drugs by Bolivia. Bolivian Vice Minister, Huáscar Ajta said at the first round of the Bolivia-Venezuela Business Fair in La Paz that the nearly $47 million in sales was agreed to "double what is being exported in textiles and manufacturing to United States via ATPDEA." Ajta also noted that total trade—the agreement would be signed within the framework of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) and the Trade Treaty of Peoples (TCP) -- "is three times what Bolivia previously exported to Venezuela in textiles and manufacturing." In like measure, the Venezuelan Minister of Production, Susana Rivero said that Venezuela "is not a substitute" for the United States, but "a new market with new conditions, with many facilities. This is an agreement that will allow the export sector -- even if there is a financial crisis -- to not be affected." The previous year U.S. imports from Bolivia totaled $362.6 million, including $73 million worth of jewelry and about $20 million of clothing and household textile goods, as well as $64 million of tin and $46 million of crude oil. It was estimated that more than 30,000 jobs in Bolivia depended on duty-free exports to the United States.
Argentina.
The Bolivian government announced the formation of a bilateral technical commission to assess the viability of supplying gas to Argentina. The Hydrocarbon Minister, Saul Avalos, said deliberations would begin upon his return from Buenos Aires on December 1 to agree on the terms, including the volume and payment commitments. As it stood at the time Bolivia exported nearly 1.7 million cubic meters of gas a day to Argentina, but was trying to redefine the terms of the contract in force, which established that 7.7 million cubic meters should have been supplied in the year, and with projected supplies of 16.6 million cubic meters in 2009 and 27.7 million cubic meters in 2010. Due to the limited extraction capacity the country was bound to promise only what it could accomplish with Brazilian internal markets priority.
Relations with Europe.
In summer 2013, Morales was returning from a summit in Moscow where he made comments that he would consider giving political asylum to U.S. citizen Edward Snowden. On his return trip, his place was forces to land for 14 hours in Austria after Italy, France, Spain and Portugal denied him access to their airspace on fears that Snowden was aboard the airplane. It turned out that Snowden was not on board. However, the Spanish ambassador to Austria came to the airport with two staff members to search his plane. The following week, at a summit in Cochabamba, five Latin American leaders, Argentina's Christina Fernandez de Kirchner, Uruguay's Jose Mujica, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, Suriname's Desi Bouterse and Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, denounced Morales' "virtual kidnapping" and the U.S. pressure they believed resulted in the action. A statement at the end of the summit demanded answers from France, Portugal, Italy and Spain, but did not mention the U.S. Morales also later said "We don't need a US embassy in Bolivia. My hand would not shake to close the US embassy. We have dignity, sovereignty. Without the US, we are better politically, democratically." Maduro said "Europe broke all the rules of the game. We're here to tell President Evo Morales that he can count on us. Whoever picks a fight with Bolivia, picks a fight with Venezuela." Correa said that all the leaders present were offering "all of our support" to Morales and called the move an aggression against the Americas. Russia also criticised France, Spain and Portugal said that "the actions of the authorities of France, Spain and Portugal could hardly be considered friendly actions towards Bolivia [...] Russia calls on the international community to comply strictly with international legal principles." Though France apologised in a statement to the Bolivian government with French President Francois Hollande saying that there was "conflicting information" over the passenger manifest, Morales said "apologies are not enough because the stance is that international treaties must be respected." Bolivia said that it wwould summon the French and Italian ambassadors and the Portuguese consul to demand explanations. Peru's Ollanta Humala was also at the summit that he had arranged. In the end, Venezuela said that it had offered Snowden asylum. Bolivia also offered him asylum.
Relations with India.
India's largest investment project in Latin America was the Jindal Steel and Power iron ore project worth US$2.1 billion and said to be the largest single module of any commercial direct reduction technology project in the world. However, there were hurdles when Bolivian Mines Minister Jose Pimentel said that an addendum may have been required for the Mutun iron ore reserves, amidst Morales' protective provisions in the new constititution to ensure foreign entrepreneurs do not gain an unfair advantage over underdeveloped resources. However, Jindal, later said that the project was back on track.
Relations with Iran.
Iran's top diplomat in Bolivia said his country would open two low-cost public health clinics in the country, which is South America's poorest. Iranian business attache Hojjatollah Soltani said his country planned to use Bolivia as a base for future Red Crescent medical programmes across the continent.
On a visit to Iran, Morales also secured Iranian assistance in promotion of hydrocarbon development. An Iranian commission would help Bolivia to study different options of promoting petro-chemistry and agribusiness production, as well as seek to quicken an investment of about $1.1 billion that Iranian President Ahmadnenijad promised on his visit to Bolivia in September, 2007. Bolivia described the trip as an attempt to reach out to other states "rejected by the international community." Morales added that the two are as "two friendly and revolutionary countries" that are strengthening ties; adding that Iran's efforts to provide economic and political backing would "support the peasant struggle in Latin America." Iran's investments would boost bilateral economic and agricultural ties, from milk processing plants, to television and radio stations, including an agreement to provide Bolivian state television with Spanish-language programming, to funding hydroelectric exploration. Reports also indicated an interest in Bolivia's reserves of uranium and lithium for use in Iranian nuclear projects. Morales previously joked that he too is a part of the "axis of evil."
During another visit to Iran in 2010, together with the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad he said there was a need to "strengthen the resistance front formed by independent and freedom-seeking nations to fight against imperialism and global hegemony."
Relations with Libya.
Following Libya's establishment of diplomatic relations on August 13 and Libyan ambassador to Bolivia, Ali Farfar's, announcement of US$80 million in investments, Morales attended the thirty-ninth anniversary of the Libyan Revolution, where he met the Libyan leader Coloner Muammar al-Gaddafi at Benghazi. In Libya he secured support for his government and for democratic change in Bolivia, more active trade, energy cooperation and improved diplomatic relations. The secretary of the Popular Congress, Muftah Queepe, said Libya ratified its support for the revolutionary and democratic process Morales was applying in Bolivia. Queepe also described Morales as a great revolutionary and defender of Bolivian society’s most basic rights, while stressing Morales’ willingness to solve the Bolivian problems. Morales added tgat "In my country, our goal is to achieve the social equality." He also drew support in Libyan circles by expressing satisfaction over Italy’s decision to compensate Libya for damages caused during its occupation, adding the need for other countries to follow that example. He also praised Gaddafi's philosophy of Islamic socialism. Along with Iran, he also secured Libyan investment in Bolivia's hydrocarbons industry which, despite substantial energy reserves, was struggling to meet a commitment to pump natural gas to Argentina and Brazil.
Relations with Russia.
With Bolivia the focus on relations with Russia is mainly economic, as opposed to political and strategic, as an agreement to invest in Bolivia's natural gas fields shows. It is seen to "help Latin America...it expands Latin America's economic opportunities, diversifies its relationships...that's healthy."
2008 saw, as a first step to re-establish ties with Russia, the Bolivian government had plans to purchase a small batch of Helicopters. Ambassador Leonid Golubev told The Associated Press that he would like to see Russia's ties to Bolivia one day "approach the level" of its growing partnership with Venezuela.
In 2009, amid improving relations between the two countries, Bolivia and Russia signed various agreements pertaining to energy and military ties, mining activities and illegal drug eradication.
Relations with the United States.
Prior to becoming president a rift with the U.S. was foreshadowed after Morales called President George W. Bush a terrorist: "Bush is the only terrorist, because he is the only one who intervenes militarily in the affairs of other countries. This is state terrorism, but those who demand their rights, those people are not terrorists."
On September 10, 2008, Evo Morales declared the US Ambassador to Bolivia, Philip Goldberg, persona non grata—the eighth U.S. ambassador to be declared so, which was quickly followed by the ninth. Goldberg said of the decision that "I regret that the Bolivian government took this decision. I think this has set back U.S.-Bolivian relations." Morales had accused him of conspiring with the opposition after Goldberg was caught on film leaving the office of opposition prefect Rubén Costas following a secret meeting in the early hours of the morning. The U.S. reciprocated by expelling the Bolivian ambassador in Washington. Tensions grew further when Bolivia refused permission for planes from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to fly over Bolivian territory. Morales said: "It's important that the international community knows that here, we don't need control of the United States on coca cultivation... We can control ourselves internally. We don't need any spying from anybody."
Morales said his country should not fear U.S. suspension of trade preferences with Bolivia. In Vallegrande, near where Che Guevara died, he said: "We don't have to be afraid of an economic blockade by the United States against the Bolivian people." Still, his government announced it would send a delegation to Washington to lobby for the country's continued participation in the ATPDEA, a regional trade pact with Andean states offering lowered import tariffs for cooperating with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts.
Relations took a further bite when Morales ordered DEA agents to leave the country within three months from November 1, 2008. In expelling the U.S. agents, he accused them of supporting the opposition separatists, conspiring to overthrow him, spying and having killed farmers. Morales said his country can fight cocaine trafficking on its own. Morales told police officers in the administrative capital of La Paz that, "Some politicians say that with the withdrawal of the DEA, drug trafficking will increase ... I trust that our national police is prepared to fight drug traffickers. We're capable of funding the operations of the national police against drug trafficking." This followed moves earlier in the year where the presidents anti-drug czar Felipe Caceres said Bolivia should "nationalize" the fight against the drug trade, and that the government was ready to invest about $16 million to achieve this.
A 2008 annual report to the U.S. Congress cited three states, including Bolivia, for failing to fight illegal drugs, the first time Bolivia made it onto the most severe category on the list with other political opponents like Venezuela and Myanmar. Morales upped the ante and condemned the United States in saying that it has no such authority to certify whether other countries are successfully fighting drug trafficking. He added that the counter-narcotics "certification process of the U.S. government has to end. It's just political vengeance. It would have to be the OAS or the United Nations that would lead an effort like that."
Rapprochement.
In November 2008, Morales said that he wanted to improve ties with the incoming U.S. administration of Barack Obama. After addressing the U.N. General Assembly, he told the press that "My interest is how to improve relations with the new president. I think we could have a lot of things in common. If we talk about change I have some experience now. I think it would be good to share experiences with the new president-elect." However, ominous signs were also apparent when he repeated allegations against the DEA, saying "The DEA will not return while I am still president. The DEA ... had an intelligence structure, but it wasn't so much to fight drugs, it had more to do with the political aggression against my government...In recent times, we've seen some officials of the DEA involved in political conspiracy."
He added that his government would set up a new intelligence operation involving the military and police to fight drug trafficking in place of the DEA. Later Morales met with four U.S. lawmakers to discuss the expulsion of the U.S. Ambassador. After the meeting Richard Lugar (R-In), said that the United States rejected any suggestion that it did not respect Bolivia's sovereignty or the legitimacy of its government. Morales responded that he was confident relations with the United States would improve when Obama becomes president.
Vietnam and China.
In the light of the declining U.S. economy following the economic crisis of 2008, Bolivian trade officials looked for alternative markets to close an export gap with trade reduction between the U.S. and Bolivia. The country chose Vietnam and China in this regard. Deputy Foreign Minister Pablo Guzman said he would be looking into the possibility of signing bilateral trade agreements with the two countries. The move was said to not only cover the gap, but also expand exports in general.
Criticism and controversy.
Dispute with Europe over Immigration.
A new EU immigration law detaining illegal immigrants for up to 18 months before deportation triggered outrage across Latin America, with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatening to cut off oil exports to Europe.
Evo Morales wrote an open letter to the EU criticizing the new restrictions, published in the British Guardian newspaper as an opinion-editorial on June 16, 2008. On June 18, Morales said that the European law was "racist."
Said Morales on EU immigration law:
"We, too, could say that we are going to expel those who have looted and stolen from us, those who imposed policies of hunger and misery, those who exported illness, exploitation, discrimination."
G-20 Summit.
Together with former Former Cuban President Fidel Castro, Morales said the summit of Group of 20 states was dominated by U.S. President George W. Bush and didn't focus on the problems that plague poorer countries. While Castro said a statement published at the end of the summit didn't address any of the "abuses" caused by the U.S. economic system, Morales said developed countries have provided more money to help distressed banks than they have committed to poor countries to improve health, education and development. "The so-called consensus of the G-20 continues to emphasize market principles and free trade. To get out of this crisis we have to break with the neo-liberal economic model and the capitalist system."

Auchlochan Platform railway station served Auchlochan, a hamlet in the county of South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It was served by local trains on the Coalburn Branch south of Glasgow.
There is now no station convenient for Auchlochan.
History.
Opened by the Caledonian Railway it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. Passing on to the Scottish Region of British Railways during the nationalisation of 1948. It was then closed by the British Railways Board.
The site today.
The platforms has been removed but the alignment of the line and a level crossing gate show its location.

Protected Streaming

Protected Streaming is a DRM technology by Adobe. The aim of the technology is to protect digital content (video or audio) from unauthorized use. 
Protected Streaming consists of many different techniques; basically there are two main components: encryption and SWF verification.
This technique is used by the Hulu desktop player and the RTE Player. Fifa.com also uses this technique to serve the videos on the official site. Some videos on YouTube also use RTMPE, including those uploaded there by BBC Worldwide.
Encryption.
Streamed content is encrypted by the Flash Media Server "on the fly", so that there is no need to encrypt the source file (a significant difference from Microsoft's DRM). For transmission ("streaming"), a special protocol is required: either RTMPE or RTMPS.
RTMPS uses SSL-encryption. In contrast, RTMPE is designed to be simpler than RTMPS, by removing the need to acquire a SSL Certificate. RTMPE makes use of well-known industry standard cryptographic primitives, consisting of Diffie-Hellman key exchange and HMACSHA256, generating a pair of RC4 keys, one of which is then used to encrypt the media data sent by the server (the audio or video stream), whilst the other key is used to encrypt any data sent to the server. RTMPE caused less CPU-load than RTMPS on the Flash Media Server.
Adobe fixed the security issue in January 2009, but did not fix the security holes in the design of the RTMPE algorithm itself. Analysis of the algorithm shows that it relies on security through obscurity. Amongst other things, this renders RTMPE vulnerable to Man in the Middle attacks.
Tools which have a copy of the well-known constants extracted from the Adobe Flash player are able to capture RTMPE streams, a form of the trusted client problem. Adobe issued DMCA takedowns on RTMPE recording tools, including rtmpdump, to try to limit their distribution. However in the case of rtmpdump, this led to a Streisand effect.
SWF verification.
The Adobe Flash player uses a well-known constant, appended to information derived from the SWF file (a hash of the file and its size), as input to HMACSHA256. The HMACSHA256 key is the last 32 bytes of the server's first handshake packet. The Flash Media Server uses this to limit access to those clients which have access to the SWF file (or have been given a copy of the hash and the size of the SWF file).
All officially allowed clients (which are in fact *.swf files) need to be placed on the Flash Media Server streaming the file. Any other client requesting a connection will receive a "connection reject".
The combination of both techniques is intended to ensure streams cannot be sniffed and stored into a local file, as SWF verification is intended to prevent third party clients from accessing the content. However, it does not achieve this goal. Third party clients are free to write the decrypted content to a local file simply by knowing the hash of the SWF file and its size. In practice, therefore, Adobe's own implementation of the Macromedia Flash Player is the only client which does not allow saving to a local file.
The only possible way to restrict connections to a Flash Media Server is to use a list of known hosts, to avoid the whole player (the Flash client) being placed on an unauthorised website. Even this has no real benefit for mass-distributed files, as any one of the known hosts could take a copy of the data and re-distribute it at will. Thus "known host" security is only useful when the known hosts can be trusted not to re-distribute the data.
