Roller shutter

A roller shutter, roller door or sectional overhead door is a type of door or window shutter consisting of many horizontal slats (or sometimes bars or web systems) hinged together. The door is raised to open it and lowered to close it. On large doors, the action may be motorized. It provides protection against wind and rain. In shutter form, it is used in front of a window and protects the window from vandalism and burglary attempts.
Applications.
Roller shutters have many applications, including doors for vans, garages, kitchens, schools, prisons and warehouses. In some parts of the world, roller shutters are subsidized by local governments due to the inherent security benefits. In areas that are frequently exposed to inclement weather, roller shutters are used as a method of insulation and can protect windows against hail damage.

Lipniki, Ostrołęka County

Lipniki is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Łyse, within Ostrołęka County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It lies approximately north of Ostrołęka and north of Warsaw. Established in 1663 by Wiśniewski, a settler from Piotrków Trybunalski, Lipniki is the oldest historically documented village in the Kurpie region of Poland.
The village has a population of 1,152.
Name.
The name "Lipniki" most likely comes from the Polish "lipa," or linden tree, which grow in abundance in the village and environs. Apparently Wiśniewski was inspired by the pleasant odor of the linden trees and named the settlement accordingly. There are however those who claim that the name comes from a variety of shoes made from linden wood called "Lipnioki."
Historical Structures.
Among structures considered historically significant are:
History.
The founder of Lipniki was a man named Wiśniewski, supposedly a nobleman, who was an escapee from the settlement of Piotrków Trybunalski. Having escaped either from a court sentence or from vicious rumors, he established a settlement in 1663. 10 years later he applied to the Starostwo for the right to establish the settlement as the village of Lipniki. He also had to appeal to the Royal Beekeeping Society and accept the so-called "Prawo Bartne" or "Beekeeper's Laws." This was a set of laws governing the production and sale of honey, wax, and related products, which were a chief product of this region and were particularly valuable to the noble class at the time.

French frigate Aréthuse (1812)

The Aréthuse was a 46-gun 18-pounder frigate of the French Navy. She served during the Napoleonic Wars, took part in the conquest of Algeria and ended her days as a coal depot in Brest.
Construction.
"Aréthuse" was laid down at Nantes in 1807 and launched on 15 May 1812.
Career.
Cruise off West Africa, 1812-1813.
On 25 November 1812 the frigates "Aréthuse" (Captain Pierre Bouvet) and "Rubis" sailed from Nantes to intercept British trade off West Africa. In January, having captured a Portuguese ship, "La Serra", they reached Cap-Vert.
On 27 January 1813, "Aréthuse" intercepted the brig HMS "Daring" (Lieutenant Pascoe) off Tamara (one of the Iles de Los off Guinea). "Daring" was run aground and was burnt to avoid capture, and part of her crew was taken prisoner. Pascoe and his men sailed to the Sierra Leone River, where they arrived the next day and reported the presence of the French frigates to the HMS "Amelia" (Captain Frederick Paul Irby). The prisoners of "Daring" were released in a boat on parole.
In the night of 5 February, a storm threw "Rubis" ashore, where she was wrecked, and damaged "Aréthuse" rudder. "Rubis" was abandoned and set afire, while "Aréthuse" effect her repairs.
On 6 February, HMS "Amelia", guided and reinforced by sailors from "Daring", attacked "Aréthuse". A furious, 4-hour night battle followed. "Aréthuse" and "Amelia" disabled each other by shooting at their sails and rigging. Eventually the ships parted, neither able to gain the upper hand, and both with heavy casualties: "Amelia" had 46 killed and 51 wounded; "Aréthuse" suffered over 20 killed and 88 wounded, and 30 round shot had struck her hull on the starboard side below the quarter deck.
"Aréthuse" returned to the wreck of "Rubis" to gather her crew, and returned to France. Soon afterwards "Aréthuse" captured the British privateer "Cerberus", and arrived back in St Malo on 19 April having taken 15 prizes.
Later life and disposal.
She took part in the Invasion of Algiers in 1830 as a transport. In 1833, she was razeed into a corvette. She was decommissioned in 1861 and used as a coal depot in Brest.

Mandibular fracture

Mandibular fracture, also known as fractures of the jaw, are breaks through the mandibular bone. They usually occur due to trauma and are often associated with other facial trauma.
The types of mandibular fractures include fractures at the symphyseal area, horizontal ramus, mandibular angle and condylar neck.
Classification.
There are various classification systems of mandibular fractures in use.
Location.
This is the most useful classification, because both the signs and symptoms, and also the treatment are dependent upon the location of the fracture. The mandible is usually divided into the following zones for the purpose of describing the location of a fracture (see diagram): condylar, coronoid process, ramus, angle of mandible, body (molar and premolar areas), parasymphysis and symphysis.
Alveolar.
This type of fracture involves the alveolus, also termed the alveolar process of the mandible.
Condylar.
Condylar fractures are classified by location compared to the capsule of ligaments that hold the temporomandibular joint (intracapsular or extracapsular), dislocation (whether or not the condylar head has come out of the socket (glenoid fossa) as the muscles (lateral pterygoid) tend to pull the condyle anterior and medial) and neck of the condyle fractures. E.g. extracapsular, non-displaced, neck fracture. Pediatric condylar fractures have special protocols for management.
Coronoid.
Because the coronoid process of the mandible lies deep to many structures, including the zygomatic complex (ZMC), it is rare to be broken in isolation. It usually occurs with other mandibular fractures or with fracture of the zygomatic complex or arch. Isolated fractures of the coronoid process should be viewed with suspicion and fracture of the ZMC should be ruled out.
Ramus.
Ramus fractures are said to involve a region inferiorly bounded by an oblique line extending from the lower third molar (wisdom tooth) region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle, and which could not be better classified as either condylar or coronoid fractures.
Angle.
The angle of the mandible refers to the angle created by the arrangement of the body of the mandible and the ramus. Angle fractures are defined as those that involve a triangular region bounded by the anterior border of masseter muscle and an oblique line extending from the lower third molar (wisdom tooth) region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle.
Body.
Fractures of the mandibular body are defined as those that involve a region bounded anteriorly by the parasymphysis (defined as a vertical line just distal to the canine tooth) and posteriorly by the anterior border of the masseter muscle.
Parasymphysis.
Parasymphyseal fractures are defined as mandibular fractures that involve a region bounded bilaterally by vertical lines just distal to the canine tooth.
Symphysis.
Symphyseal fractures are a linear fractures that run in the midline of the mandible (the symphysis).
Fracture type.
Mandibular fractures are also classified according to categories that describe the condition of the bone fragments at the fracture site and also the presence of communication with the external environment.
Greenstick.
Greenstick fractures are incomplete fractures of flexible bone, and for this reason typically occur only in children. This type of fracture generally has limited mobility.
Simple.
A simple fracture describes a complete transection of the bone with minimal fragmentation at the fracture site.
Comminuted.
The opposite of a simple fracture is a comminuted fracture, where the bone has been shattered into fragments, or there are secondary fractures along the main fracture lines. High velocity injuries (e.g. those caused by bullets, improvised explosive devices, etc...) will frequently cause comminuted fractures.
Compound.
A compound fracture is one that communicates with the external environment. --> In the case of mandibular fractures, communication may occur through the skin of the face or with the oral cavity. --> Mandibular fractures that involve the tooth-bearing portion of the jaw are by definition compound fractures, because there is at least a communication via the periodontal ligament with the oral cavity and with more displaced fractures there may be frank tearing of the gingival and alveolar mucosa.
Involvement of dentition.
When a fracture occurs in the tooth bearing portion of the mandible, whether or not it is dentate or edentulous will affect treatment. Wiring of the teeth helps stabilize the fracture (either during placement of osteosynthesis or as a treatment by itself), so the lack of teeth will guide treatment. When an edentulous mandible (no teeth) is less than 1 cm in height (as measured on panoramic radiograph or CT scan) addition risks apply because the blood flow from the marrow (endosseous) is minimal and the healing bone must rely on blood supply from the periosteum surrounding the bone. If a fracture occurs in a child with mixed dentition different treatment protocols are needed.
Other fractures of the body, are classified as open or closed. Because fractures that involve the teeth, by definition, communicate with the mouth this distinction is largely lost in mandible fractures. Condylar, ramus, coronoid process and ramus fractures are generally closed whereas angle, body and parasymphsis fractures are generally open.
Displacement.
The degree to which the segments are separated. The larger the separation, the more difficult it is to bring them back together (approximate the segments)
Favorablity.
For angle and posterior body fractures, when the angle of the fracture line is angled back (more posterior at the top of the jaw and more anterior at the bottom of the jaw) the muscles tend to bring the fracture segments together. This is called favorable. When the angle of the fractures is pointing to the front, it is unfavorable.
Age of the fracture.
While mandible fractures have similar complication rates whether treated immediately or days later, older fractures are believed to have higher non-union and infection rates although the data on this makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.
Signs and symptoms.
General.
By far, the two most common symptoms described are pain and the feeling that teeth no longer correctly meet (traumatic malocclusion, or disocclusion). The teeth are very sensitive to pressure (proprioception), so even a small change in the location of the teeth will generate this sensation. Patients will also been very sensitive to touching the area of the jaw that is broken, or in the case of condylar fracture the area just in front of the tragus of the ear.
Other symptoms may include loose teeth (teeth on either side of the fracture will feel loose because the fracture is mobile), numbness (because the inferior alveolar nerve runs along the jaw and can be compressed by a fracture) and trismus (difficulty opening the mouth).
Outside the mouth, signs of swelling, bruising and deformity can all be seen. Condylar fractures are deep, so it is rare to see significant swelling although, the trauma can cause fracture of the bone on the anterior aspect of the external auditory meatus so bruising or bleeding can sometimes be seen in the ear canal. Mouth opening can be diminished (less than 3 cm). There can be numbness or altered sensation (anesthesia/paraesthesia in the chin and lower lip (the distribution of the mental nerve).
Intraorally, if the fracture occurs in the tooth bearing area, a step may seen between the teeth on either side of the fracture or a space can be seen (often mistaken for a lost tooth) and bleeding from the gingiva in the area. There can be an open bite where the lower teeth, no longer meet the upper teeth. In the case of a unilateral condylar fracture the back teeth on the side of the fracture will meet and the open bite will get progressively greater towards the other side of the mouth.
Sometimes bruising will develop in the floor of the mouth (sublingual eccymosis) and the fracture can be moved by moving either side of the fracture segment up and down. For fractures that occur in the non-tooth bearing area (condyle, ramus, and sometimes the angle) an open bite is an important clinical feature since little else, other than swelling, may be apparent.
Condylar.
This type of fractured mandible can involve one condyle (unilateral) or both (bilateral). Unilateral condylar fracture may cause restricted and painful jaw movement. --> There may be swelling over the temporomandibular joint region and bleeding from the ear because of lacerations to the external auditory meatus. --> The hematoma may spread downwards and backwards behind the ear, which may be confused with Battle's sign (a sign of a base of skull fracture), --> although this is an uncommon finding so if present, intra-cranial injury must be ruled out. If the bones fracture and overlie each other there may be shortening of the height of the ramus. This results in gagging of the teeth on the fractured side (the teeth meet too soon on the fractured side, and not on the non fractured side, i.e. "open bite" that becomes progressively worse to the unaffected side). --> When the mouth is opened, there may be deviation of the mandible towards the fractured side. --> Bilateral condylar fractures may cause the above signs and symptoms, but on both sides. Malocclusion and restricted jaw movement are usually more severe. Bilateral subcondylar fractures are sometimes termed "flail mandible", and can cause involuntary posterior movement of the tongue with subsequent obstruction of the upper airway. Displacement of the condyle through the roof of glenoid fossa and into the middle cranial fossa is rare. Bilateral condylar fractures combined with a symphyseal fracture is sometimes termed a guardsman's fracture. The name comes from this injury occurring in soldiers who feint on parade grounds and strike the floor with their chin.
Epidemiology.
Mandible fracture causes vary by the time period and the region studied. In North America, blunt force trauma (a punch) is the leading cause of mandible fracture where as in India, motor vehicle collisions are now a leading cause. On battle grounds, it is more likely to be high velocity injuries (bullets and shrapnel). Prior to the routine use of seat belts, airbags and modern safety measures, motor vehicle collisions where a leading cause of facial trauma. The relationship to blunt force trauma explains why 80% of all mandible fractures occur in males. Mandibular fracture is a rare complication of third molar removal, and may occur during the procedure or afterwards. With respect to trauma patients, roughly 10% have some sort of facial fracture, the majority of which come from motor vehicle collisions. When the person is unrestained in a car, the risk of fracture rises 50% and when an unhelmeted motorcyclist the risk rises 4-fold.
Diagnosis.
Imaging.
Plain film radiography.
Traditionally, plain films of the mandible would be exposed but had lower sensitivity and specificity owing to overlap of structures. Views included AP (for parasymphsis), lateral oblique (body, ramus, angle, coronoid process) and Towne's (condyle) views. Condylar fractures can be especially difficult to identify, depending on the direction of condylar displacement or dislocation so multiple views of it are usually examined with two views at perpendicular angles.
Panoramic radiography.
Panoramic radiographs are tomograms where the mandible is in the focal trough and show a flat image of the mandible. Because the curve of the mandible appears in a 2-dimensional image, fractures are easier to spot leading to an accuracy similar to CT except in the condyle region. In addition, broken, missing or malaligned teeth can often be appreciated on a panormic image which is frequently lost in plain films. Medial/lateral displacement of the fracture segments and especially the condyle are difficult to gauge so the view is sometimes augmented with plain film radiography or computed tomography for more complex mandible fractures.
Computed tomography.
Computed tomography is the most sensitive and specific of the imaging techniques. The facial bones can be visualized as slices through the skeletal in either the axial, coronal or sagittal planes. Images can be reconstructed into a 3-dimensional view, to give a better sense of the displacement of various fragments. 3D reconstruction, however, can mask smaller fractures owing to volume averaging, scatter artifact and surrounding structures simply blocking the view of underlying areas.
Research has shown that panoramic radiography is similar to computed tomography in its diagnostic accuracy for mandible fractures and both are more accurate than plain film radiograph. The indications to use CT for mandible fracture vary by region, but it does not seem to add to diagnosis or treatment planning except for comminuted or avulsive type fractures, although, there is better clinician agreement on the location and absence of fractures with CT compared to panoramic radiography.
Treatment.
Like all fractures, consideration has to be given to other illnesses that might jeopardize the patient, then to reduction and fixation of the fracture itself. Except in avulsive type injuries, or those where there might be airway compromise, a several day delay in the treatment of mandible fractures seems to have little impact on the outcome or complication rates.
General Considerations.
Since mandible fractures are usually the result of blunt force trauma to the head and face, other injuries need to be considered before the mandible fracture. First and foremost is compromise of the airway. While rare, bilateral mandible fractures that are unstable can cause the tongue to fall back and block the airway. Fractures such as a symphyseal or bilateral parasymphyseal may lead to mobility of the central portion of the mandible where genioglossus attaches, and allow the tongue to fall backwards and block the airway. In larger fractures, or those from high velocity injuries, soft tissue swelling can block the airway.
In addition to the potential for airway compromise, the force delivered to break the jaw can be great enough to either fracture the cervical spine or cause intra-cranial injury (head injury). It is common for both to be assessed with facial fractures.
Finally, vascular injury can result (with particular attention to the internal carotid and jugular) from high velocity injuries or severely displaced mandible fractures.
Loss of consciousness combined with aspiration of tooth fragments, blood and possibly dentures mean that the airway may be threatened.
Reduction.
Reduction refers to approximating the ends of the bones edges that are broken. This is done with either an open technique, where an incision is made, the fracture is found and is physically manipulated into place, or closed technique where no incision is made.
The mouth is unique, in that the teeth are well secured to the bone ends but come through epithelium (mucosa). A leg or wrist, for instance, has no such structure to help with a closed reduction. In addition, when the fracture happens to be in a tooth bearing area of the jaws, aligning the teeth well usually results in alignment of the fracture segments.
To align the teeth, circumdental wiring is often used where wire strands (typically 24 gauge or 26 gauge) are wrapped around each tooth then attached to a stainless steel arch bar. When the maxillary (top) and mandibular (bottom) teeth are aligned together, this brings the fracture segments into place. Higher tech solutions are also available, to help reduce the segments with arch bars using bonding technology.
Fixation.
Simple fractures are usually treated with closed reduction and indirect skeletal fixation, more commonly referred to as maxillo-mandibular fixation (MMF). The closed reduction is explained above. The indirect skeletal fixation is accomplished by placing an arch bar, secured to the teeth on the maxillary and mandibular dentition, then securing the top and bottom arch bars with wire loops.
Many alternatives exist to secure the maxillary and mandibular dentition including resin bonded arch bars, Ivy loops (small eyelets of wires), orthodontic bands and MMF bone screws where titanium screws with holes in the head of them are screwed into the basal bone of the jaws then secured with wire.
Closed reduction with direct skeletal fixation follows the same premise as MMF except that wires are passed through the skin and around the bottom jaw in the mandibule and through the piriform rim or zygomatic buttresses of the maxilla then joined together to secure the jaws. The option is sometimes used when a patient is edentulous (has no teeth) and rigid interal fixation cannot be used.
Open reduction with direct skeletal fixation allows the bones to be directly mandipulated through an incision so that the fractured ends meet, then they can be secured together either rigidly (with screws or plates and screws) or non-rigidly (with transosseous wires). There are a multitude of various plate and screw combinations including compression plates, non-compression plates, lag-screws, mini-plates and biodegradable plates.
External fixation, which can be used with either open or closed reduction uses a pin system, where long screws are passed through the skin and into either side of a fracture segment (typically 2 pins per side) then secured in place using an external fixator. This is a more common approach when the bone is heavily comminuted (shattered into small pieces, for instance in a bullet wound) and when the bone is infected (osteomyelitis).
Regardless of the method of fixation, the bone need to remain relatively stable for a period of 3–6 weeks. On average, the bone gains 80% of its strength by 3 weeks and 90% of it by 4 weeks. There is great variation depending on the severity of injury and health of the wound and patient.
Special Considerations.
Condyle.
The best treatment for condylar fractures is controversial. There are two main options, namely closed reduction or open reduction and fixation. Closed reduction may involve intermaxillary fixation, where the jaws are splinted together in the correct position for a period of weeks. --> Open reduction involves surgical exposure of the fracture site, which can be carried out via incisions within the mouth or incisions outside the mouth over the area of the condyle. --> Open reduction is sometimes combined with use of an endoscope to aid visualization of fracture site. --> Although closed reduction carries a risk of the bone healing out of position, with consequent alteration of the bite or the creation of facial asymmetry, it does not risk temporary damage to the facial nerve or result in any facial scar that accompanies open reduction. --> A systematic review was unable to find sufficient evidence of the superiority of one method over another in the management of condylar fractures. Paediatric condylar fractures are especially problematic, owing to the remaining growth potential and possibility of ankylosis of the joint. Early mobilization is often recommended as in the Walker Protocol.
Edentulous mandible.
A broken jaw that has no teeth in it faces two additional issues. First, the lack of teeth makes reduction and fixation using MMF difficult. Instead of placing circumdental wires around the teeth, existing dentures can be left in (or Gunning splints, a type of temporary denture) and the mandible fixated to the maxilla using skeletal fixation (circummandibular and circumzygomatic wires) or using MMF bone screws. More commonly, open reduction and rigid internal fixation is placed.
When the width of the mandible is less than 1 cm, the jaw loses its endosteal blood supply. Instead, the blood supply comes largely from the periosteum. Open reduction (which normally strips the periosteum during the dissection) can lead to avascular necrosis. In these cases, oral surgeons sometimes opt for external fixation, closed reduction, supraperiosteal dissection or other techniques to maintain the periosteal blood flow.
High Velocity Injuries.
In high velocity injuries, the soft tissue can be severely damaged far from the bullet wound itself due to hydrostatic shock. Because of this the airway must be carefully managed and vessels well examined. Because the jaw can be highly comminuted, MMF and rigid internal fixation can be difficult. Instead, external fixation is often used.
Pathologic fracture.
Fractures where large cysts or tumours are in the area (and weaken the jaw), where there is an area of osteomyelitis or where osteonecrosis exist cause special challenges to fixation and healing. Cysts and tumours can limit effective bone to bone contact and osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis compromise blood supply to the bone. In all of the situations, healing will be delayed and sometimes, resection is the only alternative to treatment.
Prognosis.
The healing time for a routine mandible fractures is 4–6 weeks whether MMF or rigid internal fixation (RIF) is used. For comparable fractures, patients who received MMF will lose more weight and take longer to regain mouth opening, whereas, those who receive RIF have higher infection rates.
The most common long-term complications are loss of sensation in the mandibular nerve, malocclusion and loss of teeth in the line of fracture. The more complicated the fracture (infection, comminution, displacement) the higher the risk of fracture.
Condylar fractures have higher rates of malocclusion which in turn are dependent on the degree of displacement and/or dislocation. When the fracture is intracapsular there is a higher rate of late-term osteoarthritis and the potential for ankylosis although the later is a rare complication as long as mobilization is early. Pediatric condylar fractures have higher rates of ankylosis and the potential for growth disturbance.,
History.
Management of mandible fractures has been mentioned as early as 1700 B.C. in the Edwin Smith Papyrus and later by Hippocrates in 460 B.C., "Displaced but incomplete fractures of the mandible where continuity of the bone is preserved should be reduced by pressing the lingual surface with the fingers...". Open reduction was described as early as 1869. Since the late 19th century, modern techniques including MMF (see below) have been described with titanium based rigid internal fixation becoming commonplace since the 1970s and biodegradable plates and screws being available since the 1980s.

Rue Saint-Malo

Rue Saint-Malo is a paved street in Brest, France. It is located in the Carpon valley, against the plateau des Capucins in the Recouvrance quarter. Only its lower half survives, as the oldest street in the city.
It runs along the wall of the terrain de la Madeleine, where once stood the convent which took in 'sinful women' and (after the revocation of the edict of Nantes) Huguenots. It is lined with 17th- and 18th-century houses and overlooked by terraced gardens. After its fountain, the road runs into the levée de Pontaniou and ends in the staircase of the Madeleine which leads to the plateau des Capucins.

Thank God for Evolution

Thank God for Evolution is a book by Michael Dowd that argues for a marriage of science and religion within an evolutionary paradigm.
It is endorsed by six Nobel Laureates: Craig Mello, John C. Mather, Thomas C. Schelling, Charles Townes, Frank Wilczek and Lee Hartwell.
It was published by Council Oak Books in November 2006 and acquired in spring 2007 by Viking Penguin. In the book and in his sermons, Dowd presents evolution as a sacred epic of emerging complexity that can be seen as “14 billion years of grace.”

Amalie Materna

Amalie Materna(born Amalia, later Amalie Friedrich-Materna) (10 July 1844 St. Georgen in der Steiermark - 18 January 1918 Vienna) was an Austrian operatic soprano. While possessing a famously powerful voice, Materna also maintained a youthful bright vocal timbre throughout her career which spanned three decades. She is best remembered today for originating several roles in operas by Richard Wagner.
Career.
Materna made her professional opera début at the Thalia Theatre in Graz in 1865. She then married Karl Friedrich, an actor, and was engaged with him singing operettas in suburban theatres near Vienna, and at the Carltheater in Vienna. She made her debut at the Vienna State Opera in 1869, singing Selika in "L'Africaine". Popularly received, Materna became a regular performer at the Vienna court for the next 25 years. Her notable performances include Amneris in the first Vienna performance of "Aida" in 1874 and the title role at the première of Goldmark's "Die Königin von Saba" (10 March 1875).
Materna was perhaps most admired for her interpretations of the works of Richard Wagner. She sang the role of Brünnhilde in the first complete Ring Cycle in Bayreuth (1876), appearing also in the first Vienna performances of "Die Walküre" (1877) and "Siegfried" (1878), and in the first Ring Cycle in Berlin at the Victoria Theatre (1881). In 1882 she originated the role of Kundry in "Parsifal" at Bayreuth, repeating the role there at every festival until 1891.
In 1884, Materna toured the United States with Hermann Winkelmann and Emil Scaria. She joined the Metropolitan Opera roster the following year making her début on 5 January 1885 as Elisabeth in "Tannhäuser". Her other roles at the Met included Valentine in "Les Huguenots", Rachel in "La juive" and Brünnhilde in "Die Walküre". Writing in "The New York Times", W. J. Henderson described her Brünnhilde as "a portrayal of world-wide celebrity and her impressive scenes with Siegmund and Wotan last night – scenes in which her deep feeling, expressive tones, and majestic appearance...told quite as strongly as the beauty and volume of her voice, were awaited with a confidence that was fully justified by the event."
She returned to Vienna later in 1885 and appeared in numerous productions there for the next nine years. Her final performance in Vienna was as Elisabeth on 31 December 1894. After her retirement she taught singing in Vienna, where she made one last public appearance in 1913, singing Kundry at a concert commemorating the centenary of Wagner's birth.

Cape Town TV

Cape Town TV is a community television channel that broadcasts in Cape Town, South Africa. It launched in September 2008 with a one-year, "temporary" license and thereafter won another such license in September 2009. It is a non-profit organisation that is licensed as a community broadcaster in terms of South Africa's Electronic Communications Act.
Signal Transmission and Reception.
CTV is a free-to-air channel that broadcasts on an analogue transmission. The channel transmits from a single low-power transmitter located on Tygerberg mountain, to the north of Cape Town. This site provides the widest possible coverage of the Cape Town metropolitan region, although it is only licensed (by ICASA) for low-power transmission. The channel is broadcast on the frequency 607.25 MHz (channel 38) on the UHF band.
Viewers can pick up the channel if they are in line-of-sight of Tygerberg mountain and their television aerials are oriented towards this site. Automatic or manual tuning of the television set should pick up the channel between the signals of SABC3 and eTV [http://www.capetowntv.org/Information/Tune-in.aspx].
The signal will vary in strength depending on how far distant the viewer is from the Tygerberg site. In order for the channel to gain a stronger signal and increased coverage of the region, additional transmitters will be needed, some of which will be of a considerably higher power. However, each transmitter is licensed to transmit particular frequencies and there is at present a shortage of available frequency spectrum (in South Africa generally, but particularly in Cape Town). Not only will CTV require considerably more funding to acquire such transmitters, but ICASA will also have to license additional frequencies for the channel. This is unlikely to happen before frequency spectrum is 'freed up' by the migration from analogue to digital television transmission, which is scheduled to be completed in 2012.
History.
Cape Town TV (known by the acronym CTV) was founded by community media activists in 2004, following the release of regulations governing the community television sector in South Africa by the broadcasting regulator, ICASA (Independent Communications Authority of South Africa). These activists formed the Cape Town Community Television Collective (CTCTC), which consisted of a grouping of organisations working in the field of community media. 
The Collective engaged in a process of ongoing discussions aimed at creating a community television channel for Cape Town, based on principles of social development, democracy, justice and human rights. Consultations were held with other civil society organisations and the wider public, which resulted in the organisation being formally launched at its first annual general meeting (AGM) in September 2006. This was attended by over 100 representatives from civil society organisations in Cape Town.
The organisation first approached the national public service broadcaster, the SABC, for a programming 'window' which would be viewed only in the Western Cape region. This approach was rejected by the SABC and the organisation then decided to stage its own broadcast. Up to this time, the only community TV broadcasts which had been allowed in South Africa were temporary broadcasts of up to four weeks in duration, which were linked to "special event" licenses. 
ICASA began issuing longer "temporary" licenses of up to one year in 2007, when it licensed Soweto TV in Johannesburg for a 12-month period in July of that year. Consequently, the CTCTC decided to also pursue a one-year license because this would provide a firmer foundation for a permanent community television channel. Application for such a license was made and this was granted by ICASA in July 2008, although the channel was only able to launch on 1 September 2008.
The channel began broadcasting with one hour of programming, which was repeated throughout the day for a two-week period. Thereafter programme hours were steadily increased until the channel was broadcasting 24 hours per day, although many programmes are repeated due to a shortage of available content. The channel does not have a budget for content acquisition, so all programmes are acquired free of charge from invididuals, production houses, organisations and government agencies.
Operational Model.
CTV's operational model is based on partnerships with various civil society organisations and tertiary education institutions. The channel is housed at AFDA, the South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance, located in the suburb of Observatory in Cape Town. AFDA provides CTV with office space, a Final Control Centre room located in the institution's television studio building, access to the production facilities of the television studio and student operators on production equipment. In return, CTV provides AFDA students with on-the-job training and experience in a real broadcast environment, broadcast of student productions and lectures by professional staff. 
CTV also has relationships with other tertiary education institutions in the city, including the University of the Western Cape (UWC), the University of Cape Town (UCT), City Varsity and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). These institutions provide production facilities and student operators for certain television productions as well as their own student short films, PSA's (Public Service Advertisements) and documentaries.
The station is run by a non-profit organisation that has other NGOs as its members. The membership base includes organisations in the fields of labour, education, sport, arts & culture and other development-oriented community organisations. Membership is currently free of charge.
Programming.
CTV has a range of programming that includes content that is acquired from various sources (such as independent producers, community members, production houses, organisations, educational institutions and government agencies) and programmes that are produced either 'in-house' or by programme partners using studio facilities located at AFDA, UWC or UCT.
Programmes are mainly of a documentary nature, covering topics such as NGOs, health, spirituality, religion, human rights, democracy, environment and world affairs. The channel has made a name for itself by broadcasting programmes that would never be shown on conventional television stations. These include controversial issues such as 'conspiracy theories' (e.g. Illuminati, the 9-11 attacks, etc.), animal rights/anti-cruelty, UFOs, the Mayan Calendar and socialism.
Other content includes short films, music programmes, talk shows, actuality programmes and lectures. CTV produces a limited number of programmes 'in-house'; these are mainly studio-based talk shows that have included a current affairs show called "Currents" and a public access show called "Open Studio" where members of the public and some radio DJs can host their own talk shows. CTV now has an 'arts desk' which produces short videos on arts, cultural and sports events in the city. Some programmes, such as "Currents" and the arts desk have a training component, where young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are mentored in video production and video journalism skills.
Programme partners include the Community Media Trust (CMT) which produces the HIV/AIDS awareness show "Siyayinqoba: Beat It!" and Workers World Media Productions, which produces "The Labour Show". Other local content providers produce shows including "What's On in Cape Town" (local events), "Street Talk" (topical issues)"Talent in Action" (amateur performers), "Talk Dini" and "The Friday Sermon" (Muslim religious issues). As of 2011, CTV broadcast Girls Talk TV, a US-based network of 4 cable TV shows geared towards the empowerment of young women. 
CTV has done a number of live broadcasts from the AFDA studio. The first of these was the station's official launch party in April 2009, episodes of "Siyayinqoba: Beat It!" and a fundraising telethon with local entertainers and celebrities in September 2009.
CTV includes the Al Jazeera (English) international news channel in its programming line-up. Al Jazeera is located in Doha and provides an alternative viewpoint on global events, with in-depth news and current affairs coverage. CTV re-broadcasts Al Jazeera live from 13H00-14H00 in the afternoons and from 20H00-21H00 in the evenings.
Challenges.
CTV, like other community television stations in South Africa, faces a number of challenges. These include funding, availability of broadcast frequencies and the migration from analogue to digital broadcasting.
In October 2009 CTV was taken off air for ten days by the national signal provider, Sentech, due to cash flow difficulties that prevented it from maintaining payments for signal distribution. Consequently the channel has embarked on a programme of action aimed at either reducing the fees charged by Sentech to community broadcasters, or incepting a government subsidy for these costs.
This programme of action resulted in a public march on Parliament in November 2009, where the station presented a list of demands to the South African government. These demands included the following:
1. That CTV is not switched off when ICASA licenses a new cell phone TV operator next year but that a frequency is allocated to carry the channel.
2. The creation of an interim support fund for existing community TV stations, in addition to the speedy implementation of the Public Broadcasting Fund.
3. That Sentech provides CTV with a good quality signal and transmission for free or at a significantly reduced rate.
4. That community TV is protected during and after the migration to digital terrestrial television.
The process of migration from analogue to digital television broadcasting that is happening in South Africa poses a significant threat to the channel. The frequency that CTV has been allocated for broadcasting by ICASA has been earmarked for mobile broadcasting, i.e. digital broadcasting to cell phones. This means that when a mobile broadcaster is licensed (which is likely to happen in mid-2010), CTV will no longer have a frequency on which to broadcast. 
Consequently the channel is challenging ICASA to provide an alternative frequency; the alternative would be for the channel to migrate to a digital broadcasting multiplex, but since very few people in South Africa will have the necessary equipment to receive such a signal prior to the switch-off of all analogue television broadcasting (planned for 2012), it means that the station would lose its audience and hence would be unsustainable. ICASA has stated that it will address this issue when it finalises digital broadcasting regulations.

<doc id="19858061" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19858061" title="Personal injury trust">
Personal injury trust

The expression personal injury trust is a legal "term of art" found in the context of the modern English law of trusts (also applicable, where relevant, to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). 
A personal injury trust is a form of trust, a legally binding arrangement, where funds are held by persons called trustees for the benefit of another or others upon the terms of a document called a trust deed.
Special characteristics.
A personal injury trust has several special characteristics:
These are important because it means that a trust does not need to have a generic title or label or be one particular type of trust or another at English law to be considered a personal injury trust. It is or is not a personal injury trust on account of its source and the involvement of the injured settlor. 
Types of trust.
A personal injury trust can be:
The needs of the settlor, their family circumstances and tax or other relevant law should dictate the type of trust used. But whatever the legal type of the trust, if it is funded by an award of compensation for a personal injury then it will be a personal injury trust. 
Personal injury trusts are sometimes referred to as "special needs trusts" but that expression is more general and can create confusion with certain trusts in other jurisdictions. A more accurate and informative alternative description might be "compensation protection trust" as that alludes to its actual purpose under English law. 
Role and practice.
The role and practice of personal injury trusts under English law. 
(1) Basic advantages
The existence of a personal injury trust can enable the injured party to obtain certain means-tested State benefits entitlements and to make the best use of the award under English law but there are also other potential advantages. 
(2) When advice should be given/sought. 
Advice on personal injury trusts is usually given by lawyers involved in all injury related cases concerning:
That is irrespective of whether or not the harm caused was physical or mental. It is irrespective of where the injury occurred. It may have occurred in the UK or abroad. It is also irrespective of the size of the payment made. 
(3) Means-tested benefits advantages. 
A personal injury trust is also considered relevant even if a person is not currently in receipt of means-tested benefits. That is because they might potentially have access to them in the future if their "assessable capital" for means-testing purposes is low enough. Long term care provision in England and Wales, either at home or in a care home, is a means-tested benefit provided by or through local authorities. 
(4) Other practical advantages of a personal injury trust. 
There are also other potential advantages of personal injury trusts apart from the retention of means-tested benefits. That is particularly in the case of older, very young, mentally incapable or other vulnerable persons:
(5) Further points of note. 
Under English law:
(6) Tax issues. 
Personal injury trusts usually carry no UK tax advantages. Compensated people need access to their award via their chosen trustees. Thus it is essential that they retain an interest as a named beneficiary in the award which they settle to form the trust fund. 
The UK taxation anti-avoidance rules prevent tax advantages being given to such "settlor interested" trusts. They apply to settlor interested personal injury trusts in the same way as they apply to trusts founded from non-personal injury related funds. 
Personal injury trusts can create adverse tax consequences under UK tax law if the wrong sort is chosen. For example if an award of more than the "nil rate band" for inheritance tax is placed in a discretionary trust or (since March 21, 2006) an ordinary life interest trust, an inheritance tax charge on the surplus becomes due immediately. The limit is £325,000 for the 2009-10 tax year. Above that a 20% charge at the inheritance tax lifetime rate will apply to the surplus. 
Importantly the above adverse tax consequences do not apply to bare trusts and certain other highly specialised types of trust arrangement. 
(7) Investment of personal injury awards. 
UK trustees will wish to comply with the Trustee Act 2000 and the general law on trustee investment. This is a complex technical field.

Introduction
<br>
We are inviting all enthusiasts of history, of beautiful environment and amazing mazovian culture to the gmina (administrative district) Szulborze Wielkie. Szulborze Wielkie belongs in the Mazovian province, in the Ostrów Mazowiecka district. Is found near gminas: Zaręby Kościelne, Nur, Małkinia, Andrzejewo and Czyżew.

The gmina’s surroundings are lovely forests. Our area is quite flat, so our parents and grandparents were usually farmers Gmina has many amazing views: Meadows and glades, ponds and rivers. The flora is also rich: wheat, corn, oats, rye, tomatoes, onions, carrots, cabbages, cucumbers. The typical animals on the farm are: cow, pigs, hens, and in the forest are boars and deers. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
History
<br>
Gmina Szulborze lies on the ziemia nurska above the river Dębianka. The village was established by Albert Szulborski of the coat of arms Mora. For the first time Szulborze is recalled in Actis terrestribus Dohocensibus (on file of ziemia drochoceńskaj) in 1547. Family Szulborscy wasn’t very rich landed gentry. However, the most famous in our gmina is the village Gostkowo.There had been living Malowiescy family. Małowiescy probably built the manor house in Gostkowo from the half of the 19th century, which exists up till today. It stands up above Brok, on North West end of the village. It is a wooden detached house. There was a big park and two ponds around this manor house. In Gostkowo the legend says lived a man was converted. He founded a statue of St Jan Nepomucen. It was put on the meadow in 1882. A local talking legend of the man which was converted is connected with a statue of a saint. Close to the road Szulborze – Czyżew, stands a stone signpost. It was built in the days of 19th century. It is possible to read two inscriptions carved in the stone: "Czyżew ½ mi" and "Gostkowo ¼ mi".
There is second old legend. There is a pond near the road from Gredzice to Mianowek. A peasant called Gredzica lived in Gredzice. The name of this village was given by him. He was a man of enormous health. In this house was working a young housemaid and a Gredzica’s wife seemed to be jealous. When the housemaid was doing the washing in the local pond, the wife drowned her. This pond is famous for some strange events.
<br>
During the Second World War the Szulborze area came under the rule of the General Government a German Nazi colonial administration. But since 24 June 1940 it belonged to the Soviet administration department. In July 1941 German come back. People tried to fight for freedom. 4.PP battalion of Home Army (AK) was formed. During the Second World War in the village Mianówek took places the most tragic events. The Jewish population of Czyżew, Zaręby Kościelne, Andrzejewo is buried there murdered by the Nazis in August 1941. 5 thousand Jews were executed. There are 2 monuments to commemorate this execution. On the tables in Polish and Hebrew we can read: “Here in the mass grave contains the remains of 5.000 Jewish men, women and children from towns Zaręby, Czyżew, Andrzejewo. There were brutally murdered by the Nazi murderers in autumn 1941. Their only crime was that they were Jews. Honor their memory”.
<br>
After the war Szulborze was a part of Ostrów district as the rural gmina. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Local Customs
<br>
Grandma’s and Grandpa’s Day
<br>Every year, on 21st and 22 January, our grandparents celebrate their own day. This day is very important, because we can show them our love and respect. In some families, the wishes cannot be given through the phone simply, so the grandsons and granddaughters visit grandparents in the family house. Except of wishes they get a lot of presents. Grandchildren usually bake a sweet cake with candles. There is a custom which says, if a celebrating person close his/her eyes and blow the lights from candles off, his/her wish will come true.
In primary school, younger classes often organize a party for their grandparents, They play a short performance as a gift.
<br>
Mother’s Day
<br>All mothers celebrate their special day in gmina Szulborze Wielkie. Children give them flowers, cards, chocolates, and the most important – wishes. Sometimes they even do the housework, so mothers can rest and enjoy their free time. They do this, because they want to thank for an effort that mothers put in children education.
Teachers from our school also prepare a gift for all our mothers. In younger classes it is a nice performance, in older – parents’ meeting..
Birthday
<br>It has been accepted in our community, that birth anniversary should be celebrated. Person who is celebrating his/her birthday, usually buys a bag full of candies and takes it to the teacher during the lesson. Teacher wishes him/her a happy birthday, smile on face, much money, good grades and much more. Then the class mates sing ”Happy Birthday” song. Every time they sing it, they do it carefully, without rush – strange, isn’t it? This activity is repeated during each lesson that day.
Of course this is the official part. After the lesson, a class mates gather somewhere away from the staff room and they start their own custom, such as hitting with a belt the celebrating person.
At home there is organized a party. The celebrating person invites his/her family and friends. There’s a lot of food and drinks with a birthday cake prepared for him/her. 
Children’s Day
<br>The most desired day by every child and teenager is Children’s Day. In this day, children don’t worry about anything, they aren’t interested in anything except having fun. First, Children get wishes and presents from parents and this is only the small part of the attractions in this day.
The best thing about this feast is that there aren't any lessons at school.
During last Children’s Day we were able to watch a spectacular performance and a lecture about addictions led by our school psychologist, Mrs. Alicja Zakrzewska. We learnt the basics of first aid and also took part in an art contest or in a run on 800 meters. At the end of the day, we ate delicious sausages and we drank an orange juice.
<br>
<br>
<br>Holidays
<br>
Christmas
<br>We all love Christmas because of its magic atmosphere. In my opinion, it is a special time, when people forget all their problems and try to be together. Christmas helps people change themselves for better. They become kind, friendly and generous. Some days before Christmas, people clean their houses. Housewives usually cook special dishes and bake Christmas cakes. On the day preceding Christmas, called Christmas Eve we set up the Christmas tree and we decorate it with chains and candles. When everything is ready, it's time for Christmas Eve supper. As soon as the first star appears in the sky, we take seats at the Christmas table. There is always one empty place for an unexpected guest. Before we start eating, we share the holy wafer, we also give presents to one another. Then we taste such dishes as red borsch, pies with sour cabbage and mushrooms, fried carp and lots of cakes. Meanwhile we sing carols or just listen to them. At midninght we often go to church to attend a midnight mass. Next day, 25 December, the first day of Christmas, we usually spend at home- eating a lot of Christmas food, singing carols and having a great time. On the second day of Christmas we either pay or receive visits.
<br>
Easter
<br>We usually celebrate Easter in April. It is the springtime Christian festival, a very specific period of time for all the believers. At Easter we celebrate Christ’s Resurrection, and His victory over death and sin. On Holy Saturday, we go to the church with basket full of eggs, sausages and bread, which is called the Easter Basket, to sacrifice it. On Easter Sunday we meet our relatives for a festive breakfast. Children get the sweets from Easter Bunny, and sometimes they look for chocolate eggs hidden in the house. People wish one another “Happy Easter” and have an occasion to talk together, too. On Easter Monday everyone can expect to be drenched with water.
<br>
<br>
<br>Important Local Events
<br>
Open-air Festival
<br>Once a year, there is an open-air festival organized by our gmina. Usually it takes place in the playground of our school. There is everything we need to have fun on festival. We can listen to music performed by a popular music star like Ewelina Flinta, eat a meal or drink something up.
<br>
Golden Wedding
<br>Golden Wedding is a feast organized in our gmina. Wojt of our gmina invited pairs which lived together for 50 years and gave them medals.
<br>
<br>
<br>School
<br>
We did a survey of students in Junior Secondary School in Szulborze Wielkie. We learned what they think about our school and what they would change. Students also told us what they achieved example results or goals.
90% pupils responded that if they were from another past of Poland they would like to get more information about a location, a history and would like some details information about how to spend time in an attractive way in Szulborze Wielkie.
50% students want would need to know something about culture and landscape of our mother country.
All students responded that our local area is interesting and we can see here example: Jews monument and bunkers from the Second World War.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Our local history says that the first school there was in Szulborze Wielkie in 1910. We known that there was Wincenty Szwantucz the first teacher in Szulborze Them from 25 th January 1919 Marcel Bujanowski started to work. He made a real students’ list. The school was public. An average attendance was 61 figures. There were three classes. Subjects which children were taught were:
<br>• R.E 
<br>• Polish language
<br>• Accounts
<br>• Art
<br>• Singing
<br>
The great students’ success was to finish the school, because children were working on the farms and in the fields so they usually look after a herd of cows on the meadow. Before the Second World War: Maria Godlewska, Marian Zalewski, Zofia Napiwocka, Paweł Dybek and Balanka were working as a teacher. The first wooden school building was in informal way in time of the Second World War. When the Second World Was finished the old school building was in a bad condition. 
Local people collected money and prepared materials for a new building during 10 years. After 14 years they built a new school, which still exists. In 2009 the whole community commemorated this event. 
<br>However history is made by people. Really important for this school was scouts. There were two teams between 1947-1996. The last scoutmasters was Mrs. Janina Zalewska and Mr. Krzysztof Michalec. They organized many camps in Poland and abroad. The scoutmaster Mr. Michalec formed a musicals group that played nice music and sing. It was called, The Lemonade Scout”. It took part in many famous festivals of music.
The famous Polish archbishop Stanisław Wyszyński become a patron of the Primary school in Szulborze Wielkie in 29.05.2002 r. 
In the 2007 - 2008 was built a new part of school, the gymnasium and the hall. The opening meeting was 10.12. 2008. today, this object is also used by all inhabitants of our gmina.
There are 18 teachers and 89 pupils in the Primary school and 79 students in Junior Secondary School.. Teachers are always willing to help and very friendly. At school we have two computer labs, a tennis court, a volleyball pitch, a basketball pitch and a playground. The headmaster Andrzej Grabowski says he wants to ensure that all pupils cared for, and the school is called the diamond mines. Students can develop their interest and can improve their skills. 
<br>
<br>
Young people from our area in their spare time listening to music, watching movies, learning, but also meeting with friends. 
90% of student say that school supports modern ideas for the benefit of students and attractive as well because they can spend time meeting together. 
Most teenagers do not know how to learn or do not like learn, however, 45% of them like learning.
While they were talking about they mentioned: good marks winning competitions and their friends. Some say that they did not win anything, because they were not interesting in the school affairs.
Teenagers say that teachers require a lot from them and want them to have grown to the wise.
Some people say that teachers are not interested in their problems.
In conclusion! We have a good opinion about our school, but we would like to change a few things. Nothing is perfect.

Ananda–In the Himalayas

Ananda in the Himalayas is a luxury destination spa in Narendra Nagar, Uttarakhand, set in the Indian Himalayas. 
Nestled on a Himalayan mountain estate set amidst sal forests, overlooking the river Ganges, close to the towns of Rishikesh and Haridwar, it was established in 2000, and was India's first destination spa. Ananda focusses on Yoga and Ayurvedic practices, combined with international spa therapies. The property includes the royal palace of Narendra Nagar, of the Maharaja of Tehri Garhwal (an Indian princely state), and the restored Viceregal Palace which was added to the palace in 1910–11 by the Maharaja for an expected visit of the Viceroy of India. Though the visit never materialized, the edifice remains, and went to accommodate the likes of Lord Mountbatten of Burma, a later Viceroy of India. 
Today it is considered one of the best spas in the world by the "The Telegraph" and rated No. 1 destination spa in the world by "Travel + Leisure" magazine.
Etymology.
The word "ananda" means bliss and contentment in Sanskrit 
History.
Some years ago, given the impetus on health and rejuvenation in the world and after an exhaustive search located a site for a destination spa, Ashok Khanna, discovered the Palace of the Maharaja at Narendra Nagar, Tehri-Garwhal. It was decided that the property was to be called “Ananda – in the Himalayas”, a name that embodies the spirit and ethos of what Khanna wanted to offer to his guests.
Soon the former Viceregal Palace close to the Royal palace of the Shah family, of the erstwhile princely state of Tehri Garhwal originally built in 1910–11, was restored. Narendra Nagar was the summer capital and the Palace, where the present vice regal suite of Ananda in the Himalayas is situated, is the official residence. 
Traditional Indian practices of yoga, meditation, ayurveda and vedanta are offered at the spa. Treatments include Ayurvedic spa treatments, Tibetan treatments and international therapies such as massage, body wraps and facials 
Visitors.
Ananda has been frequented by many famous guests, including Oprah Winfrey, Jerry Hall, Bill Gates and Melinda Gates, Kate Winslet, Frederick Forsyth, Deepak Chopra, Uma Thurman, Jeremy Piven, Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.
Ratings.
In 2005, "Condé Nast Traveler" rated this spa as the 'Best Overseas Spa Retreat' with a score rating of 99.62 and the Readers choice world's Number 1 destination spa (2005, 2006, 2007, 2012) It is also the only spa in India to be awarded the 5 wave certificate by BISA (British International Spa Association). Highly recommended by many other travel journals such as the "New York Times", Travel and Leisure, While its judged as 'Top Spa in India' by Spa Finder, Inc. According to a reviewer of "The Telegraph", Ananda "..mixes the healing principles of the East with the pampering needs of the West.".
Business.
Ananda is owned and managed by IHHR Hospitality Pvt. Ltd.
The Chairman of IHHR, Mr. G.K. Khanna is a visionary with over 5 decades of experience in the hotel industry. The M.D. of the company, Mr. Ashok Khanna, the son of Mr. G.K. Khanna, is a graduate from the Cornell School of Hotel Administration with over three decades of experience in hospitality. --> 
IHHR hospitality also owns and manages a chain of luxury business hotels known as Ista Hotels. The word Ista is formed by the amalgamation of two Sanskrit words Isht (personal, cherished, sacred) and Sthan(place/space) therefore denoting the new meaning of Ista as 'My personal space'. The same core values, standards and service philosophy of Ananda are carried through to the Ista brand of hotels as well.
Education.
The Ananda spa institute, located adjacent to the Ista hotel in hyderabad, admitted its pilot group of students in the summer of 2008. This educational institution is the only one of its kind in the world that provides yoga, ayurveda and international therapies under one roof. Realising the importance of international certification, the institute has got the International Therapy Examination Council (ITEC), Confederation of International Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology (CIBTEC) to prescribe the curriculum for the courses on international treatments and give the required certification. The curriculum for the Yoga and Ayurveda courses will be framed and certified by the institute itself. The institute plans to lead spa education in South East Asia and maintain high standards throughout the region with international cooperation. Josephine Wackett has been appointed Principal. She was earlier with the world famous Steiner School in London, where she was principal of the Steiner Beauty School for the last 30 years. Josephine is also the CIDESCO International Board member for Education

Murder of Swami Lakshmanananda

Swami Lakshmanananda Saraswati and four others were murdered in August 2008 in the Odisha state of India. Swami Lakshmanananda was a Hindu monk and a highly revered spiritual leader who lived a life dedicated to tribal welfare.
Past Attack.
Swami Lakshamanananda was on his way to visit Brahmanigoan village. However, a bus belonging to Mr. Sugriba Singh, Panna Christian leader and BJD Member of Parliament (Lower House) obstructed the road and Swami was attacked on that spot injuring him, driver and security guard. In his statement Swami blamed Mr. Radha Kanta Nayak, Congress Member of Parliament (Upper House) and chief of Christian group World Vision. He further stated that this was for the seventh time that they failed to kill him.
Threat.
Swami received an anonymous threat only a week before he was killed. Ashram authorities also filed an FIR with the local police. However, no steps were taken to provide appropriate security cover to Swamiji. Odisha Government admitted lapses might have occurred in his security and placed Kandhmal Superintendent of Police Nikhil Kanodia and officer-in-charge of Tumudibandha police station Jena under suspension.
Assassination.
He was killed at his kanyashram (Girls school) at Tumudibandh, about 100 km from Phulbani, the district headquarters of Kandhamal district. Four others including a boy were also killed.
The murder was committed on the Kanya Ashram (a residential school) which housed 130 girls on the day of the Janmashtami festival. A group of 30-40 armed men surrounded the Ashram. Four of the assailants carried AK-47s and many others had locally made revolvers. Two of the four government provided security guards had gone home to eat. The assailants tied and gagged the two remaining guards.
Many of the girls were eyewitnesses to the killing of the swami, as reported by Indian Express
Civil disorder and riots following assassination.
Hundreds of people had gathered en route to pay their last respects to Lakshmanananda. Riots erupted when the procession passed through localities with Christian populations. Christians, who were perceived to be Congress supporters, were targeted everywhere; in some places many Hindu families were also attacked because they were Congress supporters. The attackers included activists of the VHP, the Bajrang Dal and other Sangh Parivar organisations, and workers of the BJP and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), parties that are partners in the government headed by Naveen Patnaik. The violence also saw attacks on Christians who belonged to the Scheduled Castes and on people who claimed tribal status on the grounds that they spoke the Kui language of the Kondh tribal people. The Kui Samaj, which unites members of the native Kondh tribe in Kandhamal, was found to be very much on the side of the VHP and the ruling alliance.
Investigations.
The government announced a special investigative probe into the attack.
The police have arrested Pradesh Kumar Das, an employee of the World Vision, a Christian Charity, from Khadagpur while escaping from the district at Buguda. In another drive, two other persons Vikram Digal and William Digal have been arrested from the house of Lal Digal, a local militant Christian, from Nuasahi at Gunjibadi, Nuagaan. They have admitted to having joined a group of 28 other assailants.
On August 28, a letter of denial was received by a some media outlets, the VHP office in the Gajapati District of Orissa and the Bajrang Dal from a Maoist group. While the letter denied that the Central Committee of the Kotagarha branch of the Maoists had approved the attack, it claimed that some Maoists may have been bribed by Christians to launch the attack. Soon after the appearance of the aforementioned letter, Azad, a leader of the Maoist People's Liberation Guerrilla Army, claimed responsibility for the murder of Lakshmanananda. Azad was suspected by the police of leading the attack himself. On September 9, 2008 the Maoists, who work underground, made an official press release claiming responsibility for the killing of Lakshmanananda. A few claims that Maoist sympathizers of south Orissa had initially denied the role of CPI-Maoist were made in the murder of VHP leaders that sparked off communal violence in Kandhamnal district. Communist Party of India (Maoist) leader Sabyasachi Panda claimed that they killed Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati and four of his disciples at his Jalespeta ashram on 23 August.
On Wednesday July 22, 2009, a young Maoist couple, Surendra and Ruppi Pidikka alias Jaya Venkwara claimed to have been involved in the Swami's killing and surrendered to the Orissa police.
Reconstructing the final moments of the killing of VHP leader Laxmanananda Saraswati and his four associates in Kandhamal’s Jalespeta ashram in August 2008, Orissa police said that a Maoist who surrendered this week claimed there were four policemen at the ashram but they fled when the Maoists announced that they had come looking for the Swami. Four of the six Maoists who carried out the attack were from Chhattisgarh, the police were told. Rayagada SP Ashis Kumar Singh said Surendra Brekwada alias Dasu, who surrendered with his wife Ruppi Pidikka alias Jaya, told them that a six-member crack team of the Maoists, led by Orissa CPI (Maoist) leader Azad alias Duna Keshav Rao, reached Jalespeta ashram on August 23 evening and came across four lathi-wielding policemen. Brekwada, a sharpshooter, was one of the six who allegedly killed the 82-year-old Laxmanananda, Kishore Baba (45), Amritananda Baba (62), Mata Bhaktimayee (40) and Puranjan Ganthi (28), brother of one of the girl inmates of the tribal residential school.
In spite of claims that the case of Swamiji's murder has been solved, it is widely believed to be a cover up, based on doubts expressed by several senior investigators and experts on left-wing extremism.
Subash Chouhan, national co-convener of the Bajrang Dal, refused to accept that the Maoists were responsible, saying "Why all of a sudden so many days after the incident has come and spoken to the television channels?".
Convictions.
On 30 September 2013, Additional district judge Rajendra Kumar Tosh at an Additional district and sessions court in Phulbani convicted seven Christians for the murder: Gadanath Chalanseth, Bijaya Kumar Shyamseth, Buddha Nayak, Sanatan Badamajhi, Duryadhan Sunamajhi, Bhaskar Sunamajhi and Munda Badamajhi. However on 1 October 2013, the same court also convicted a Maoist leader from Andhra Pradesh for the same crime. The defence lawyer, S.K. Padhi said that the ruling would be appealed against in the Odisha High Court.

Yoel Zussman

Yoel Zussman also spelled Yoel Sussman (, born October 24, 1910, died March 2, 1982) was an Israeli jurist and the fourth President of the Supreme Court of Israel.
Biography.
Sussman was born in 1910 in Kraków, Austria-Hungary (now in Poland). He received his LLB from the University of London and his PhD from Heidelberg University. He immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine in 1934. He was certified as a lawyer and served as Chief Prosecutor of the Israel Defense Forces. In 1951 he was appointed to the Supreme Court and served as its Deputy President for several periods of time until 1953. 
In 1965 during the Supreme Court hearings on election appeal case "Ya'akov Yardor vs Central Election Committee for the Sixth Knesset", popularly known as El-Ard Petition, Sussman coined definition of Israel as a "self-defending democracy", which was adopted by the Court.
Supreme Court upheld ban on El-Ard (), a radical Arab electoral list, from participation in the Sixth Knesset elections and Sussman, taking the Supreme Court of West Germany ruling as a precedent, stated that there are supraconstitutional considerations hailing from natural law, that may be superior to any legislation:
Just as an Individual is not bound to agree to being killed, neither is a state is obliged to consent to being annihilated and erased from the map... The German Constitutional Court...spoke of a "fighting democracy", which does not open its doors to acts of sabotage in the guise of legitimate parliamentary activity. For myself, as far as Israel is concerned, I am prepared to confine myself to "self-defending democracy," and tools for defending the existence of the state are at hand, even if we have not found them set forth in detail in the Elections Law
In 1976 he succeeded Shimon Agranat as President of the Supreme Court. He retired in 1980 and was succeeded by Moshe Landau. He was an author several books on bill laws and arbitration laws. He died in 1982.

Muhammad Ahmad Said Khan Chhatari

Lieutenant Colonel Saeed ul-Mulk Nawab Sir Muhammad Ahmad Said Khan, Nawab of Chhatari, GBE, KCSI, KCIE, MBE, LL.D also generally referred to as Nawab of Chhatari (12 Decemeber 1888 - d. 1982) was Governor of the United Provinces, Chief Minister of United Provinces, President of the Executive Council of the Nizam of Hyderabad (i.e. Prime Minister of Hyderabad) and Chief Scout of India.
Round table conference.
During the spring session of the Provincial Council in 1929 when the subject of separate electorates came up in a debate on an innocuous topic, the United Provinces Town Areas (Amendment Bill) leading Muslims of the United Provinces, most notably the Nawab of Chhatari, spoke in favour of separate electorates.
Nawab Chhatari attended the first Round Table Conference, held in St. James Palace in London on 12 November 1930. The Muslim Delegation was led by the Aga Khan III and others, including, but not limited to, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Sir Mohammad Shafi, Maulana Mohammad Ali, Dr. Shafat Ahmad,
Sir Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, Nawab of Chhatari and Fazlul Huq.
Council to Government.
From 17 May 1923 to 11 January 1926 he was Cabinet Minister of United Provinces. In 1931 Nawab of Chhatari was appointed as Minister of Agricultural Department of United Provinces.
Until 1936 the Nawab, like other great Muslim Zamindars e.g. the Raja of Salempur, was a trusted ally of the British Government in United Provinces and a Minister in provincial government. In 1937 the "Government of India Act 1935", which was formulated after the series of round table conferences (RTCs) was to come into operation from 1 April 1937, the Nawab of Chhatari, the leader of NAPs (National Agriculturist Parties), was invited to form his Cabinet.
He was also Minister of Home Affairs in Provincial Government of United Provinces with the salary of Rs.2,500 in 1937.
The Nawab of Chhatari was also member of the National Defence Council from July to August 1941. Later he resigned to accept the post of President of the Hyderabad Executive Council.
Disquiet with Jinnah.
Nawab of Chhatari attended third sitting of the open session of Muslim League which was held in the Pandal at Lalbagh, Lucknow, on Sunday, 17 October 1936, at 10:30 a.m. and was presided by Jinnah. The meeting was also attended by Maulana Shaukat Ali, Moulana Hasrat Mohani, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan, Dr Syed Husain, Raja Gazanfar Ali Khan, Khan Bahadur Kuli Khan, Fazlul Huq, Nawab Jamshed Ali Khan, and others.
Nawab of Chhatari expressed disquiet with the Jinnah's adherence to the Resolution of 23 March 1940. Jinnah asked Chhatari to come out "with a definite scheme of his own" and promised that he would bear that scheme in mind while making a final decision in this regard on 22 October 1940. Chhatari suggested that ""We must get as many Hindus out of the Congress as possible to join hands with us"". His suggestion clearly implied establishment of an all-India federation. The League was not unanimous on Pakistan even after the Lahore resolution.
Prime Minister of Hyderabad.
Nawab of Chhatari was appointed President of the Executive Council of the Nizam of Hyderabad (i.e. Prime Minister of Hyderabad) in August 1941. The Nawab of Chhatari had previously resigned from the National Defence Council on accepting the post of President of the Hyderabad Executive Council. He served on this post from September 1941 to 1 November 1947.
On 6 September 1941 Bahadur Yar Jung, Nizam of Hyderabad, praised Nawab of Chhatari as able administrator. In 1944 Nawab of Chhatari was granted of the title of Saeed-ul-Mulk by H.E.H. the Nizam of Hyderabad. On 25 November 1945, Nawab of Chhatari laid the foundation stone of the Institution of Engineers(India), A.P. State Center (Visvesvarayya Bhavan).
In 1946 the Nizam of Hyderabad suggested to British Raj that the Nawab of Chhatari may be appointed as Governor of Central Provinces and Berar.
Chhatari delegation.
When the Nizam saw that Clause 7 of the Indian Independence Bill did not permit that grant of Dominion Status to an Indian State, he sent a delegation to Delhi on 11 July 1947, headed by the Nawab of Chhatari, President of the Executive Council, to meet Lord Mountbatten of Burma. On 17 August 1947 Nawab of Chhatari wrote to Mountbatten expressing his wish to enter the negotiations.
In August 1947 Sir Walter Monckton (Constitutional advisor to Nizam) and Nawab of Chhatari tendered his resignation to Nizam due to attack on their delegation by Razakars and Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen,
but it was refused.
On 27 October 1947 Razakars and Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen staged a demonstration at the houses of the members of delegation, i.e. Sir Walter Monckton, Nawab of Chhatari and Sir Sultan Ahmed and made it impossible for delegation to leave for Delhi.
On 21 December 1947 Gandhiji had talks with Nawab of Chhatari along with H.S. Suhrawardy, Brijlal Nehru, Rameshwari Nehru, Sheikh Abdullah, Begum Abdullah, Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed, Prince of Kutch, Maharaja of Bhavnagar and Anantrai Pattani.
The Nizam of Hyderabad, in his radio speech on 23 September 1948, said ""In November last , a small group which had organized a quasi-military organization surrounded the homes of my Prime Minister, the Nawab of Chhatari, in whose wisdom I had complete confidence, and of Sir Walter Monkton, my constitutional Adviser, by duress compelled the Nawab and other trusted ministers to resign and forced the Laik Ali Ministry on me. This group headed by Kasim Razvi had no stake in the country or any record of service behind it. By methods reminiscent of Hitelerite Germany it took possession of the State, spread terror ... and rendered me completely helpless.""
The conferences that followed bore no fruit and the Nawab of Chhatari, finding matters intolerable, resigned as President of the Executive Council of the Nizam of Hyderabad.
Public life.
On 23 October 1931 Nawab hosted a dinner which was attended by Iqbal. In 1935 he represented India in a mangoes exhibition in London, where he represented "Rataul" mango, which won first prize and was declared the best mango in the world. On 15 January 1939 his message was published in a pamphlet issued by Education Expansion Department on occasion of The Literacy Day. In 1945 Mahatma Gandhi sent Nawab two letters; one from Panchgani and other from Sevagram. Nawab was also patron of Jamia Urdu,Aligarh, Aligarh.
He had also served as Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University from December 1965 to 6 January 1982.
Nawab also served as the Chief Scout of the All India Boy Scouts Association from 1955 to 1982.
Early life and Family.
He was born to Nawab Mohammad Abdul Ali Khan.the Nawab of Chhatari on 12th December, 1888 in Chhatari, United Province of British India. He did his education from MAO College of Aligarh He was married to daughter of his own uncle Nawab Abdul Samad Khan Bahadur, the Nawab of Talibnagar. His had a son named Farhat Sayeed Khan, who was noted for his interest in Hindustani classical music.

__NOTOC__
The Meridionali/Agusta EMA 124 was a light utility helicopter flown in prototype form in Italy in 1970. The design was undertaken by Agusta for production in a joint venture with Elicotteri Meridionali, based on the Bell 47 that Agusta was building under licence at the time.
The EMA 124 retained the Bell 47's dynamic components, tubular tail, and undercarriage, but was fitted with a new, more aerodynamic forward fuselage with a cabin to seat three. The fuel tank and engine installation were also "cleaned up", and the rotor omitted the stabiliser bars fitted to the Bell 47's rotor.
A single prototype was flown in 1970 (registration I-EMAF), but nothing further came of the project.

Battle of Savenay

The Battle of Savenay took place on 23 December 1793, and marks the end of the Virée de Galerne operational phase of the first war in the Vendée. A Republican force of approximately 18,000 decisively defeated the Armée Catholique et Royale force of 6,000 at Savenay.
Prelude.
After a crushing defeat at the battle of Le Mans on 12 December 1793, a few thousand Vendéens fled to Laval and then to Ancenis, hoping to cross the Loire back into Vendée. Without boats, crossing the river was impossible. Hence the Vendéens built small boats and approximately 4,000 people, including Henri de La Rochejaquelein and Jean-Nicolas Stofflet, managed to cross before the arrival of Republican ships. The Vendéen rear guard was stranded to the north of the Loire, and tried another way around. They went to Blain, 35 km north of Nantes, but had to go back towards Savenay, 30 km west of Nantes.
The eve of the battle.
Savenay was taken by the Vendéens early morning of 22 December, with practically no fighting. The 150 republican soldiers quickly pulled back after a small skirmish with the Vendéen first line and the town's population was evacuated. At 9:00, the royalists prepared the defenses of the town. The republicans under Westermann were the first to arrive, at 11:00. They attacked but were pushed back after a small skirmish. At noon, Kléber and Marceau arrived with the greater part of the Republican army. Another skirmish was fought for the control of the Touchelais woods, to the north-east of Savenay, which the Republicans won.
Those were the last skirmishes of the day because a fog rose during the afternoon; the Republicans kept their positions. At nightfall some "représentants en mission", Pierre-Louis Prieur, Louis Marie Turreau, and Pierre Bourbotte, arrived at the Republican camp. Surprised at the troops' inaction, they ordered military engagement so as to not allow the enemy to rest; Westermann agreed. A war council was held at which Kléber insisted they had to wait for sunrise before attacking; Marceau sided with Kléber and managed to convince Pierre-Louis Prieur. The Republicans took advantage of the night to deploy. At 2:00 in the morning, Tilly's division, which came from Vannes, arrived and deployed in time. Simon Canuel commanded the left flank, Kléber the middle-left, Marceau the middle-right and Tilly the right. Apart from a few passages to the south of the town, the Vendéens were surrounded.
The battle.
At sunrise the battle started, but surprisingly it was the Vendéens and Chouans who launched it in order to take the Touchelais woods and not be surrounded. The attack was commanded by Lyrot and saw success: they captured two cannons and 40 prisoners. Soon after, Kléber launched a counter-attack with his Gendarmes regiment, charging with bayonets and forcing the Vendéens to pull back to the gates of Savenay. In the center, Marceau, commanding the "légion des Francs" and "Chasseurs de Kastel", encountered difficulties and was for a moment restrained by the Vendéen artillery.
On their respective fronts, Canuel, Tilly and Westermann also launched attacks, putting pressure on the royalists on all sides. Soon, the Republicans entered the town despite the resistance of Marigny's artillery. Street combat took place amid great confusion, house by house; numerous Vendéen families participated in the fighting. The Vendéen artillery deployed in front of the church and managed to hold their ground for a while. Fleuriot tried an ultimate counter-attack, he picked 200 to 300 cavalrymen, commanded by Cadoudal, with Pierre-Mathurin Mercier and a few infantrymen. They attacked and pierced Tilly's lines and tried to attack Republican lines along their flank, but the Republican reserves arrived and forced the cavalrymen to retreat.
During that time, on the church square, the Republicans took control of the cannon and turned it against the Vendéens. They fled, pursued by the Republicans, retreating out of Savenay and regrouping to the west of the town (the battle's commemorative cross marks that place). The Vendéens took their last two remaining cannons, which Marigny had kept in reserve, and tried to cover the retreat of the wounded and non-combatants. During this engagement, Lyrot was killed. Marigny retreated again, west to the Blanche-couronne woods, with his two cannons and what was left of his men. He held his position for an hour, then cheered with his men in the marsh for he had managed to escape. To the north-west, a group of 600 Vendéens managed to hold at the Butte des Vignes, and retreated later to the Blanche-couronnes woods but they were encircled mid-way by a corps of the Armagnac regiment and were massacred.
Inside Savenay, the town was searched and hundreds of elders, women and children were taken out of their houses and locked in the church before their trials. The wounded of both sides were brought to the Saint-Armel hospital and taken care of. By 2:00 in the afternoon, the battle was over.
The flight and massacres.
After the battle, Kléber marched in Nantes to celebrate the victory with most of the troops. Yet the republican cavalry under Marceau and Westermann chased the Vendéens, searching the neighboring villages and the countryside, killing or capturing those left behind.
During the search, the brigadier general Alexis Antoine Charlery attacked a position held by 500 Vendéens but failed to defeat them. He proposed that they surrender in exchange for the right to go home unimpeded, a proposition that they accepted and signed. The prisoners were sent to Nantes for ratification of the arrangement by a "Représentant en mission", but he refused and had the prisoners shot and general Charlery arrested. He was later freed and reassigned.
The Bignon Commission which arrived during the day was given the task of judging the prisoners. The commission worked for 3 days and ordered the execution of all the Vendéen combatants caught bearing arms. The executions started that same evening and lasted 8 days, but the number executed is unknown. According to official statistics, they numbered 662, but there are doubts as to whether or not this number only reflects those executed during the 3 first days. The "représentant en mission" Benaban wrote that more than 2,000 were shot. Similarly, General François Carpantier boasted that he had 1,500 people executed. The 1,679 women and children were sent to prisons in Nantes. Some officers, such as Kléber and Savary, asked Carrier to spare them, but Carrier refused to listen and had them all shot or drowned.
Other massacres took place in the countryside. Westermann and his hussards shot 500 to 700 prisoners, men, women and children, at the Sem forest near Prinquiau. Westermann, nicknamed the "butcher of the Vendéens" supposedly wrote to the Committee of Public Safety:
Nonetheless, some Vendéens were lucky enough to manage to escape, helped by the local population. Jean Legland, ferryman on the Loire, declared in 1834 that he helped 1,258 escapees pass in the days following the battle of Savenay. This was confirmed by written testimonies by the Abbé Bernier. In total, 2,500 people might have survived the battle.
Consequences.
The battle marked the end of the Virée de Galerne, and definititively ended the threat of Vendée to the Republic. Yet the war did not stop then and there: fighting continued in Vendée. General Marceau, outraged by his soldiers' behavior, asked to be transferred. Marceau was soon replaced by Kléber as general of the Army of the West, and thereafter by Louis Marie Turreau. Guerrilla fighting continued for some time between the Vendéens and the Republican infernal columns.
In popular culture.
Jules Verne described the battle in the beginning of his historical novel Le Comte de Chanteleine (1862).

History.
The Tanjō range is small but rich in history. The history has deep relation with the temple , on Mount Tanjō. The name Tanjō, and its older names Nibu and Nyu, refer to a mine of amalgam at this mountain. The Tanjō Shrine on the top of Mount Tanjō is a place to worship the goddess of amalgam which was believed to inhabit the mountain. Even today, we can see so many religious objects in this mountain range.
However, the Buddhist temples were burned by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1580 during a war between Oda Nobunaga and Bessho Nagaharu. Hideyoshi was in the service of Nobunaga, and the Myōyō temple was allied with Nagaharu. The temples were rebuilt by Hideyoshi soon afterward, but were heavily damaged in the "Haibutsu kishaku" movement of the Meiji period, when Buddhism was persecuted in favor of the native Shinto religion.

The One O'Clock Chop

"The One O'Clock Chop" is a young adult novel by written by Ralph Fletcher, first published in 2007.
Background.
Ralph Fletch drew up on own experiences in being a clam digger when he was between seventeen and twenty years old. He considers this his first piece of historical fiction and interviewed many Hawaiian woman as part of the research for this novel.
Plot summary.
Matt a fourteen your old boy living on Long Island in 1973 takes a job with Dan a clam digger so that he can earn enough money to buy a used Boston Whaler. Jazzy, Matt's cousin from Hawaii arrives to spend the summer with Matt and his mother. Jazzy and Matt become kissing cousins until Jazzy becomes interested in another boy. They eventually become friends again and Matt learns to stand up for himself.
Explanation of the novel's title.
The One O'Clock Chop is a daily breeze that suddenly moves across the bay where Matt lives roughening up the smooth surface. Dan says "the old salts say you can set your watch by it."
Reception.
Publishers Weekly in their review said "Fletcher turns a coming-of-age story into a rich, affecting read." Suzanne Gordon reviewing for the School Library Journal said "plenty of universal teen fascinations and concerns exist for those readers willing to enter Matt's world and give themselves over to this smoothly paced and competently written novel. Kirkus Reviews said "Fletcher's insight into Matt and his boat dreams fly off the page with a solid resonance that will make this a quick, light, summer beach read." James Blasingame in his review for the Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy said that "the author captures that tumultuous time period in the mid-teen years when young people are exactly in the middle between being adults and children. Love and hope are always bubbling near the surface in these years, and Matt exemplifies this about as well as a character can."

Conrad Roland

Conrad Roland (born "Conrad Roland Lehmann" in 1934) is a German architect and pioneer of the construction of spacenets (tensile structures), which primarily are to be found as rope climbing frames on playgrounds. In 1978 he designed and constructed the biggest spacenet of the world until today, the Super Four Mast Spacenet, for the Federal Horticultural Show (BUGA).
Life.
Roland was born in München. After his final secondary-school examinations, he completed an apprenticeship as a carpenter. From 1954 until 1963 he studied architecture at Technical University of Munich, at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago and at TU Berlin. During his studies from 1959 till 1961 he was an assistant in Mies van der Rohe's office in Chicago.
In 1963 Roland began to work self-employed in Berlin. He mainly compiled studies, projects and documentations on Hanging-houses and Spacenets. The plans for the construction of a sports stadium in Abu Dhabi, which he developed in co-operation with Jörn-Peter Schmidt-Thomsen in the 1960s, won the tendering competition, but has never been realized.
The subject of spatial net architecture was elaborately covered in his book publication "Frei Otto – Spannweiten" (1965). A scholarship of the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, Chicago allowed the work of this monograph. In 1967 Roland worked as guest lecturer in Portsmouth; in 1967 and 1969 he held lectures on “Hanging Houses” in Canada and the United States.
From 1970 onwards the architect devoted himself to the development of the Play-Spacenets. His accomplishments concerning this principle of construction have been honoured with several prizes in and outside the country. In 1974 Roland founded the company “Conrad Roland Spielbau”, which planned and constructed rope play equipment and climbing nets from 1974 until 1985. The succeeding corporation COROCORD Raumnetz GmbH has been carrying the initial letters of his name in the corporate name until today.
Already in 1975 the “Super Two Mast Spacenet” came into being for the Federal Horticultural Show (BUGA) in Mannheim, Germany.
For the BUGA in Düsseldorf in 1987 Roland constructed the biggest Spacenet of the world until today, the “Super Four Mast Spacenet” in Südpark Düsseldorf, which is still in use after remedial maintenance in 2007.
Predominantly, the architect developed Spacenets for playgrounds. In his publication, such as the patent specification for “Spatial Networks” in 1974, Conrad Roland revealed the multitude of applicability of the Spacenets: e.g. multi-level sun terraces, trellis, summer houses, beach and exhibition pavilions or as frame structure for exhibition spaces and sales areas, seat and reclining furniture and also work scaffoldings.
Since 1987 Roland lives in Hawaii.

Battle of Granville

The Siege of Granville occurred at Granville, Manche on 14 November 1793. It faced 5,000 Republicans besieged by Vendéen forces during the Virée de Galerne. It was a Republican victory.
Battle.
A rumour ran through the Vendéen ranks that if they reached a port the English would come to their aid. Their first choice was the port at Saint-Malo but they finally fixed on Granville, apparently less well-defended. On 14 November the Vendéens arrived before the city, but they had no siege equipment and the English had not shown up. Even so, the Vendéens launched an assault and took the suburbs, but their advance was hampered when a fire which broke out and burned down the suburbs. The Vendéens thus passed by the grêve and began to climb the rocks at the foot of the ramparts, when cries of "Treason!" began to spread through their ranks, probably shouted by Republican spies. Quickly panic overtook the Vendéens and, as many fled, the assault failed. Having heard no news of the English forces (despite their actually being very nearby, at Jersey), La Rochejaquelein decided to raise the siege.
Results.
This victory was decisive for the Republicans, who thus avoided the Vendéens and Chouans joining up with the English forces. Discouraged, the Vendéens made an about-turn in an attempt to cross the River Loire again, and managed to fight several more battles in the campaign.

<doc id="19858707" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19858707" title="Mauthner cell">
Mauthner cell

The Mauthner Cells are a pair of big and easily identifiable neurons (one for each half of the body) located in the rhombomere 4 of the hindbrain in fish and amphibians that are responsible for a very fast escape reflex (in the majority of animals - a so-called C-start response). The cells are also notable for their unusual use of both chemical and electrical synapses.
Evolutionary history.
Mauthner cells first appear in lampreys (being absent in hagfish and lancelets), and are present in virtually all teleost fish, as well as in amphibians (including postmetamorphic frogs and toads). Some fish, such as the lumpsuckers seem to have lost the Mauthner cells however.
Role in behavior.
The C-start.
A C-start is a type of a very quick startle or escape reflex that is employed by fish and amphibians (including larval frogs and toads). There are two sequential stages in the C-start: first, the head rotates about the center of mass towards the direction of future escape, and the body of the animal exhibits a curvature that resembles a letter C; then, at the second stage, the animal is propelled forward. The duration of these stages varies from species to species from about 10 to 20 ms for the first stage, and from 20 to 30 ms for the second. In fish this forward propulsion does not require contraction of the antagonistic muscle, but results from the body stiffness and the hydrodynamic resistance of the tail. When an antagonistic muscular contraction does occur during stage 2, the fish rotates in the opposite direction, producing a counter-turn, and a directional change.
The role of the Mauthner cell in the C-start behavior.
In cases when an abrupt acoustic, tactile or visual stimulus elicits a single action potential in one M-cell, it always correlates with a contralateral C-start escape. An extremely quick mutual feedback inhibitory circuit then assures that only one M-cell reaches spiking threshold—as the C-start has to be unilateral by definition—and that only one action potential is fired.
The Mauthner cell-mediated C-start reflex is very quick, with about 5-10 ms latency between the acoustic/tactile stimulus and the Mauthner cell discharge, and only about 2 ms between the discharge and the unilateral muscle contraction. Mauthner cells are thus the quickest motor neuron to respond to the stimulus. It makes the C-start response behaviorally important as a way to initiate the escape reflex in an "all or nothing" fashion, while the direction and speed of the escape can be corrected later through the activity of smaller motor neurons.
In larval zebrafish about ~60% of the total population of reticulospinal neurons are also activated by a stimulus that elicits the M-spike and C-start escape. A well-studied group of these reticulospinal neurons are the bilaterally paired M-cell homologues denoted MiD2cm and MiD3cm. These neurons exhibit morphological similarities to the M-cell including a lateral and ventral dendrite. They are located in rhombomeres 5 and 6 of hindbrain respectively, and also receive auditory input in parallel with the M-cell from the pVIIIth nerve. In fish, water jet stimuli that activate these neurons elicit non-mauthner initiated C-starts of a longer latency, compared with M-cell associated ones.
Although the M-cell is often considered the prototype of a command neuron in vertebrates, this designation may not be fully warranted. Although electrical stimulation of the M-cell is sufficient for eliciting a C-start, this C-start is normally weaker than the one evoked by a sensory stimulus. Moreover, the C-start can be evoked even with the M-cell ablated, although in this case the latency of the response increases. The most widely accepted model of the M-cell system, or brainstem escape network, is that the M-cell initiates a fixed action pattern to the left or right by activating a spinal motor circuit initially described by J. Diamond and colleagues, but the precise trajectory of the escape is encoded by population activity in the other classes of reticulospinal neurons functioning in parallel to the M-cell. This notion is supported by studies using "in vivo" calcium imaging in larval zebrafish which show that MiD2cm and MiD3cm are activated along with the M-cell when an offending stimulus is directed towards the head but not the tail, and are correlated with C-starts of a larger initial turn angle.
Another component of the escape response is mediated by cranial relay neurons that are activated by the Mauthner cell spike. These neurons are electrically coupled with motoneurons which innervate extraocular, jaw and opercular muscles and mediate pectoral fin adduction in hatchetfish. This component of the neural circuit was first described by Michael V.L. Bennett and colleagues.
Mauthner cells in other types of behavior.
Mauthner cells may be involved into behavioral patterns other than the C-start, if these types of behavior also require extremely quick bending movement of the body. Thus in goldfish Mauthner cells are activated during prey capture near the surface of the water, as this type of hunting is dangerous for the fish, and it would benefit from leaving the surface as soon as possible after the prey is captured.
In adult postmetamorphic anurans (frogs and toads) that do not have a tail, M-cells are nevertheless preserved and their discharges are associated with rapid movement of legs during an escape.
Morphology and connections.
Inputs to the M-cell: excitation and feed forward inhibition.
The M-cell has two primary aspiny (lacking Dendritic spines) dendrites which receive segregated inputs from various parts of the neural system. One dendrite projects laterally and the other projects either in the ventral or medial direction, depending on the species.
The ventral dendrite receives information from the optic tectum and spinal cord while the lateral dendrite receives inputs from the octovolateralis systems (the lateral line, acoustic inputs from the inner ear, and inertial information from the statoliths brought by the cranial nerve VIII).
The fibers from the ipsilateral cranial nerve VIII terminate in excitatory mixed electrical and glutamatergic synapses on the M-cell. They also electrically activate glycinergic inhibitory interneurons that terminate on the M-cells. Despite the inhibitory input having one more synapse in its pathway, there is no delay between the excitation and inhibition because the intervening synapse is electrical. It was shown that for weak stimuli the inhibition wins over the excitation, preventing the M-cell from a discharge, while for stronger stimuli excitation becomes dominant. The Inner ear afferents also terminate with electrical synapses on a population PHP inhibitory interneurons (see below) to provide an additional level of feed forward inhibition. The Mauthner cell also has GABA-, dopamine-, serotonin- and somatostatinergic inputs, each restricted to certain dendritic region.
Inputs from the optic tectum and the lateral line help control which way the C-startle bends by biasing the mauthner cells when there are obstacles in the vicinity. In cases where movement away from the stimulus is blocked, the fish may bend towards the disturbance.
Axon cap.
The Mauthner cell axon hillock is surrounded by a dense formation of neuropil, called the Axon cap. The high resistance of this axon cap contributes to the typical shape of the Mauthner cell field potential (see below). In its most advanced form the axon cap consists of a core, immediately adjacent to the Mauthner cell axon, and containing a network of very thin unmyelinated fibers, and a peripheral part. This peripheral part contains the large unmyelinated fibers of the PHP neurons (see below) that mediate the inhibitory feedback to the Mauthner cell; the Mauthner cell itself also sends small dendrites from its axon hill to the peripheral part of the axon cap. Finally, the surface of the axon cap is covered with a "cap wall" composed of several layers of astrocyte-like glial cells. Both glial cells and the unmyelinated fibers are coupled with each other by means of gap junctions.
Evolutionarily, the axon cap is a more recent development than the Mauthner cell itself, so some animals, such as lampreys and eels, while having functional Mauthner cells, don't have axon cap at all, while some other animals, such as amphibia and lungfish, do have a very simplified version of it.
Feedback network.
The main part of the Mauthner cell-associated network is the negative feedback network, which assures that only one of the two Mauthner cells fires in response to the stimulus and that, whichever Mauthner cell fires, it does so only once. Both these requirements are quite natural considering that the consequences of a single Mauthner cell discharge are so strong; a failure to comply with these two rules would not only prevent the animal from escaping, but could even physically damage it. The fastest part of this negative feedback network, which is also the one closest to the Mauthner cell, is that of the so-called "passive hyperpolarizing field potential" or PHP neurons. The fibers of these neurons are located in the axon cap, and they receive inputs from both ipsilateral and contralateral Mauthner cells. The field potentials of PHP neurons are strongly positive, and form a part of the 'Signature field potential' of the Mauthner cell (see below), with the early (ipsilaterally initiated) component being called the Extracellular Hyperpolarizing Potential (EHP), and the later (contralaterally initiated) component being sometimes addressed in the literature as the Late Collateral Inhibition (LCI). The action of PHP neurons onto the Mauthner cells is mediated by electrical, and not chemical effects: the outward currents generated by the action potentials in axon cap fibers flow inward across the Mauthner cell axon hillock and hyperpolarize it.
Outputs.
The only axon of the Mauthner cell reaches from the cell to the midline of the hindbrain, promptly crosses it to the contralateral side, and then descends caudally along the spinal cord. A single discharge of the M-cell achieves a whole set of parallel effects onto the spinal motor networks: 1) it monosynaptically excites large primary motoneurons at one side of the body; 2) disinaptically excites smaller motoneurons at the same side of the body; 3) initiates action potentials in inhibitory interneurons electrically coupled to the M-cell axon, and by their means inhibits a) inhibitory interneurons still at the same side of the body (to prevent them from interfering with the C-start), as well as b) motoneurons at the other side of the body. As a result of this pattern of activation the quick muscles at one side of the body contract simultaneously, while the muscles at the other side of the body relax.
Electrophysiology.
Ephaptic properties.
The inhibition of the M-cell by the PHP cells occurs by ephaptic interactions. The inhibition is brought about without a chemical synapses or electrical synaptic coupling having low resistance gap junctions joining the cells. When the region of the PHP cell axon outside the axon cap depolarizes, the influx of positive charge into the cell through voltage gated sodium channels is accompanied by a passive outflow of current from the PHP cell axon into the region bound by the axon cap. Due to the high resistance of the surrounding glial cells, the charge does not dissipate and the potential across the M-cell membrane is increased, hyperpolarizing it.
Signature field potential.
Because of its size, presence of a quick feedback network, and abundance of electrical and quasi-electrical (ephaptic) synapses, the Mauthner cell has a strong field potential of a very characteristic shape. This field potential starts with a high-amplitude potential sink up to tens of mV in amplitude that originates from the Mauthner cell discharge, and which is closely followed by a positive potential, called Extrinsic Hyperpolarizing Potential or EHP, which is associated with the activity of the recurrent feedback network.
Due to its high amplitude, in some animals the negative part of Mauthner cell field potential can be detected up to several hundred micrometres away from the cell itself. The positive components of the field potential are strongest in the axon cap, reaching amplitudes of 45 mV in adult goldfish. With a knowledge of these properties of the field potential, it is possible to use field potential monitoring as a way to find the Mauthner cell body in vivo, or in vitro in a whole brain preparation, moving the recording electrode in the hindbrain, while at the same time stimulating the spinal cord, thus evoking antidromic action potentials in the Mauthner cell axon.
Plasticity.
Application of serotonin was shown to increase inhibitory inputs to the M-cell, while application of dopamine - to increase the amplitude of both chemical and electrical components of the VIIIth nerve responses via a G protein-mediated activation of postsynaptic D2 receptor. An activity-dependent LTP can be evoked in M-cells by a high-frequency stimulation of the VIIIth nerve. Surprisingly, this LTP is electrical synapse-mediated, and is presumed to involve modification of the gap junction channels. A possibility of LTP induction by sensory stimuli in vivo, and the evidence for the LTP of inhibitory inputs to M-cells were also demonstrated.
Spontaneous preference in turn direction in young goldfish is correlated with one of the Mauthner cells being bigger than the other one. It is possible to change the preference of fish by raising them in conditions facilitating turns in a specific direction; this shift is accompanied by a correspondent change in M-cell sizes.
History of research.
The Mauthner cell was first identified by the Viennese ophthalmologist Ludwig Mauthner in the teleost fish for its associated neural circuit which mediates an escape response called the C-start or C-startle to direct the fish away from a predator.
The M-cell is a model system in the field of Neuroethology. The M-cell system has served for detailed neurophysiological and histological investigations of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Studies by Donald Faber and Henri Korn helped to establish the one vesicle hypothesis of synaptic transmission in the CNS. Other important research topics that have been investigated in the M-cell system include studies by Yoichi Oda and colleagues on inhibitory long-term potentiation and auditory conditioning of the startle response, and studies by Alberto Pereda and colleagues on plasticity of electrical synapses. Other research topics investigated in the M-cell system include studies of spinal neural networks and neural regeneration by Joe Fetcho and colleagues, as well as underwater sound localization, and the biophysics of computation in single neurons.

It was formerly a limited express sleeper train service operated by JR Kyushu, which ran from to and in Kyushu, Japan. The service was discontinued from the start of the revised timetable on 1 March 2005.
History.
The "Sakura" was first introduced on 1 April 1951 as a daytime Limited express service between Tokyo and Osaka. This service was discontinued in October 1958.
The "Sakura" sleeping car service commenced on 20 July 1959 using 20 series sleeping cars. From March 1972, the train was upgraded with 14 series sleeping cars.
From 4 December 1999, the "Sakura" ran coupled with the "Hayabusa" service between Tokyo and . The last services ran on the evening of 28 February 2005.
From 12 March 2011, the "Sakura" name was revived once again for the new shinkansen services operating between and using new JR West N700-7000 series and JR Kyushu N700-8000 series 8-car trainsets. "Sakura" trains operate once every hour between Shin-Osaka and Kagoshima-Chūō throughout the day. There are also additional "Sakura" services once per hour between and Kagoshima-Chuo during the morning and evening. During the middle of the day there will be two additional runs per hour: One between Hakata and Kagoshima-Chūō, and one between Hakata and . Some "Sakura" runs within the Kyushu Shinkansen are operated by 6-car 800 series trains.
Rolling stock.
In the 1990s, the train was formed of up to fourteen 14 series sleeping cars, including two cafeteria cars. The train was hauled by a JR West EF66 electric locomotive between Tokyo and , a JR Kyushu EF81 electric locomotive between Shimonoseki and Moji (through the undersea Kanmon Tunnel), and by JR Kyushu ED76 electric locomotives from Moji to Nagasaki and Sasebo.

Sathuragiri Hills

Sathuragiri Hills or Chathuragiri otherwise known as ' SUNDARA MAHALINGAM ' is situated 10 km from Watrap (Wathirairuppu) near Srivilliputhur. The name Sathuragiri came from Chathur (4) Veda (Vedas) Giri (Hill), where all the four Vedas met and formed the hill. Another meaning is that the whole mountain is in square (Chathuram) in shape so the name Chathuragiri. Sathuragiri is the Abode of God. It is otherwise also called as Mahalingam Hill.
This is also called as "Siddargal boomi". 18 Siddhas were used to live here. abode of god was bending position ..another god calls santhana mahalingam...up to 4 km periya mahalingam statue in forest..and rivers..navagraga stone in top of hill...
This is a mysterious hill where it is believed that siddhars still worship the lord Shiva.
How to Reach here: Pilgrims coming from Chennai direction has to come to Madurai and get down at Krishnan Koil Bus Stop on the way to Srivilliputhur then go to Watrap (Watthirairuppu). From Watrap have to go to Thaanipaarai, the base of the hill. Buses are available even from Srivilliputhur itself to Watrap and Thaniparai. Pilgrims travelling from South have to pass through Nagercoil – Tirunelveli – Rajapalayam – Srivilliputhur – Watrap -Thaniparai.
By Train: One has to take Shenkottai Express from Chennai and get down at Srivilliputhur. Then from there they can take a bus to Thaniparai (base of the Saturagiri Hill)
Up the Hill: For the first time, it takes nearly 4 to 5 hours to climb to the Top of the hill. Rest, can reach the top within 2 to 3 hours. On the hill there is no electricity, no telephone connection, no range for cell phones. We can find few number of shops selling buttermilk, coffee, snacks, etc. during some days like full moon day, no moon day and other festive seasons. Annadhana is going on from morning to evening near both the temples and stay in the shelter provided there before dark falls. Basic amenities are provided at the hill. Devotees are requested not to spoil the natural gifts in the hill. Everybody can avoid plastic covers and intoxicant materials.

The Army of the West ("armée de l'Ouest") was one of the French Revolutionary Armies. It was created on 1 August 1793 by merging the armée des côtes de Brest, the armée des côtes de La Rochelle, and the armée de Mayence, and was sent to fight the revolt in the Vendee.
History.
Reorganisation.
Visiting Republican soldiers of the armée de l'Ouest, Jean-Baptiste Carrier was aggrieved by the state in which he found them: patched uniforms, mismatched or worn-out weapons, supplies insufficient in both quantity and quality, infectious illnesses (especially venereal ones) spreading rapidly, drunkenness. For Jean-Baptiste Carrier, the negligence and greed of the "fat and bold army suppliers" that had forced the troops to behave like looters. Determined to track down the "egotism of the rich citizens of Nantes", Carrier began a requisitions scheme to improve the Armée de l'Ouest.

<doc id="19858814" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19858814" title="Dynamic mode decomposition">
Dynamic mode decomposition

Physical systems, such as fluid flow or mechanical vibrations, behave in characteristic patterns, known as modes.
In a recirculating flow, for example, one may think of a hierarchy of vortices, a big main vortex driving smaller secondary ones and so on. 
Most of the motion of such a system can be faithfully described using only a few of those patterns.
In a purely mathematical setting similar modes can be extracted form the governing equations using an eigenvalue decomposition.
But in many cases the mathematical model is very complicated or not available at all. In an experiment, the mathematical description is not at hand and one has to rely on the measured data only. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a mathematical method to extract the relevant modes from experimental data, without any recurrence to the governing equations. It can thus be applied to any dynamic phenomenon where appropriate data is available. It is similar, but different from proper orthogonal decomposition which has similar features but lacks dynamical information about the data.
Description.
A time-evolving physical situation may be approximated by the action of a linear operator formula_1 to the instantaneous state vector.
The dynamic mode decomposition strives to approximate the evolution operator formula_3 from a known sequence of observations, formula_4. 
Thus, we ask the following matrix equation to hold:
Generally, the vectors formula_6, and subsequently formula_7, are very high-dimensional, and so a strict eigendecomposition of formula_7 is computationally difficult. However, in DMD it is assumed that the set of formula_6 does not span the entire vector space (a good assumption, especially if there is spatial structure in the signal). Thus, after a given time formula_10, where formula_10 is much less than the dimensionality of the system, one can write formula_12 as a linear combination of the previous vectors, i.e., formula_13. In matrix form, we then have:
where "S" is the companion matrix
The eigenvalues of formula_16 then approximate some of the eigenvalues of formula_7. However, since the formula_16 is small (with dimensions formula_19) as compared to formula_7, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of formula_16 can be computed with ease.
Examples.
Trailing edge of a profile.
The wake of an obstacle in the flow may develop a Kármán vortex street. The Fig.1 shows the shedding of a vortex behind the trailing edge of a profile. The DMD-Analysis was applied to 90 sequential Entropy fields
and yield an approximated Eigenvalue-Spectrum as depicted below.
The analysis was applied to the numerical results, without referring to the governing equations. The profile is seen in white. The white arcs are the processor boundaries, since the computation was performed on a parallel computer using different computational blocks.
Roughly a third of the spectrum was highly damped (large, negative formula_22) and is not shown.
The dominant shedding mode is shown in the following pictures. The image to the left is the real part, the image to the right, the imaginary part of the Eigenvector.
Again, the Entropy-Eigenvector is shown in this pictures.
The acoustic contents of the same mode is seen in the bottom half of the next plot.
The top half corresponds to the entropy mode as above.
Synthetic example of a traveling pattern.
The DMD analysis assumes a pattern of the form
formula_23
where formula_24 is any of the independent variables of the problem, but has to be selected in advance.
Take for example the pattern
With the time as the preselected exponential factor.
A sample is given in the following figure with
formula_26,
formula_27 and formula_28
The left picture shows the pattern without, the right with noise added. The amplitude of the random noise is the same as that of the pattern.
A DMD analysis is performed with 21 synthetically generated fields using a time interval formula_29, limiting the analysis to formula_30.
The spectrum is symmetric and shows 3 almost undamped modes (small negative Real part), whereas the other modes are heavily damped.
Their numerical values are formula_31 respectively. The real one corresponds to the mean of the field, whereas formula_32 corresponds to the imposed pattern with formula_33. Yielding a relative error of -1/1000. Increasing the noise to 10 times the signal value yields about the same error.
The real and imaginary part of one of the latter two Eigenmodes is depicted in the following figure.
See also.
Several other decompositions of experimental data exist. If the governing equations are available, an eigenvalue decomposition might be feasible.

Matthew Barker

Matthew Barker (1619 in Great Cransley, Northamptonshire – 25 March 1698 in London) was an English Independent minister and parliamentarian, known for his work on natural theology and for his participation in English 17th-century politics.
Life.
Matthew Barker was born in Arowe Park Hospital, now in Newferry, to parents unknown. He attended Plessington College, Bebington, working as a schoolmaster in Banbury, Oxfordshire, until the outbreak of the English Civil War, at which point he became preacher to a London parish. Barker was an avid parliamentarian and was invited to preach a sermon before the House of Commons on 25 October 1648. The new republic welcomed him, and his moderation earned him the favour of the Cromwell regime, which made him an assistant to the London commission.
After the Restoration of the English monarchy, Barker became a nonconformist, forming his own London congregation. Following the Glorious Revolution, Barker worked to promote unity among Dissenters. To this end he published a collection of advice for scholars entering the ministry, entitled "Flores intellectuales". Barker's major published work was "Natural Theology" in which Barker sought to demonstrate the existence of God from the properties of nature.

Hezekiah Woodward

Hezekiah Woodward (1590–1675) was an English nonconformist minister and educator, also involved in the pamphlet wars of the 1640s. He was a Comenian in educational theory, and an associate of Samuel Hartlib. He was one of those articulating the Puritan argument against the celebration of Christmas.
Life.
In the early 1640s he was a preacher at Aldermanbury in London. At this period he was linked with John Milton, as authors in “the frequent printing of scandalous Books by divers”. He was officially examined about his writings at the end of December 1644, being released after two days, and having acknowledged authorship of some work or works, thought to have included the anonymous "As You Were". Milton either was not pulled in, or was quickly allowed to go.
Then, at Bray, Berkshire, he was an Independent minister, but was ejected in 1662, after the English Restoration of 1660. Subsequently he was in Uxbridge, one of the founders of the Old Meeting Congregational Church there.
Writings.
He engaged Thomas Edwards, a major writer on the Presbyterian side. Woodward supported Katherine Chidley against Edwards.
"As You Were: or a reducing" (1644) was published anonymously, and in support of John Goodwin. It was a reply to "Faces About", attributed to George Gillespie. Gillespie hit back in "Wholesome Severity", from the Presbyterian side.
On education, he advanced the argument that the current grammar schools lacked provision for the most elementary schooling, to the detriment of the quality of the latter. His "A Light to Grammar" (1641) makes the case for education based on stimulation; "A Gate to Science" favoured realism and intelligibility in textbooks.
Parents, in his view, delegated too much of a child's upbringing to teachers. He wrote about his own schooling, in "A Childes Patrimony" (1640), and "Portion" (1649).
Family.
His daughter Frances married John Oxenbridge. His daughter Sarah married Daniel Henchman (c.1627-1685), a founder of Worcester, Massachusetts.

Green Mosque (Balkh)

The Masjid Sabz or Green Mosque is a mosque in the city of Balkh, in northern Afghanistan. It is believed to be have been commissioned by the then ruler of the Eastern Timurid Empire, Shah Rukh, or by his wife Goharshad.
History.
After Tamerlane's death in 1405, his empire fell apart with various tribes and warlords competing for dominance. The Black Sheep Turkmen destroyed the western empire in 1410 when they captured Baghdad, but in Persia and Transoxiana Shāhrukh was able to secure effective control from about 1409. His empire controlled the main trade routes between East and West, including the legendary Silk Road, and became immensely wealthy as a result. His wife, Gowhar Shād, funded the construction of many outstanding mosques and schools throughout khorasan (western Afghanistan and eastern Persia) the most secure portions of the empire. It was during these times of stability that many architectural masterpieces where constructed. In the 1640s Mughal Prince Shah Jahan was stationed in the Balkh Province due to Uzbek incursions. Shah Jahan has been known in the region to have had made adjustments to many of the local mosques and borrowing ideas for his own buildings that he built throughout his reign, also aspects of this building are a precursor to the famous Taj Mahal, as the similarities can be seen.
Architecture.
The main building displays a typical Timurid architectural style. However, today much of the building itself has suffered heavy from neglect and damage by waring factions during the soviet and afghan civil wars. The main courtyard has been well preserved allowing people to pray in the open spaces. To the back of the building however little care has been given to the paving and gardens.
The minaret has either collapsed due to the age of the building or could have been the act of aggression during wartime by the communists. Much of the tile work has disappeared and the wooden doors are in dire need of repair.

Morgan ab Athrwys

__NOTOC__
Morgan ab Athrwys or Morgan Mwynfawr ('Morgan the Benefactor'; fl. ) was a king of Gwent and Glywysing (i.e., Morgannwg) in southeast Wales.
Reign.
Morgan was the grandson and probable successor of King Meurig. Lloyd argues that his timing and joint rule over Gwent and Glywysing makes him the probable namesake for the later realm of Morgannwg (whence modern Glamorgan), although his descendant Morgan the Old is another possibility. Through his grandmother Onbraus ferch Gwrgant Mawr, he may have been heir to the kingdom of Erging as well.
The charters, contained in the "Book of Llandaff", include a number of grants which he is said to have made, to the church of Llandaff in the time of Bishops Oudoceus and Berthguin. 
Other charters in the book, of the time of Berthguin, are attested by him, and an account is also given of ecclesiastical proceedings taken against him by Oudoceus in consequence of his murdering his uncle Ffriog Though the "Book of Llandaff" was compiled about the middle of the twelfth century, at a time when the see was vigorously asserting disputed claims, it nevertheless embodies a quantity of valuable old material, and is probably to be relied upon, in the general view it gives of the position of Morgan. 
He appears as owner of lands in Gower, Glamorgan, and Gwent, and, since the latter two districts were afterwards ruled over by his descendants, was probably sovereign of most of the region between the River Towy and the River Wye.
He seems to have been succeeded by his son Ithel, before Ithel's many sons divided their patrimony among themselves.

Nightlight (film)

Nightlight (a.k.a. View of Terror) is a 2003 television film directed by Louis Bélanger.
Plot.
The film opens with a voyeur taking pictures of an unknown woman dressing up. He later sets her house on fire while she lies unconscious in the room.
Celeste Timmerman is a woman with a successful career, an attractive boyfriend named Brent, and a good friend she can trust with all of her secrets. Lately, she has done nothing but fight with Brent, and she decides she wants to move out. Although Brent is reluctant about her moving out, Celeste buys a new apartment. Soon an unknown man begins to stalk her repeatedly by telephone. The caller says he can see her. Celeste asks her best friend Tasha for help, and Tasha suggests that Celeste block his phone calls. Meanwhile, Brent is mad over Celeste leaving and starts trying to reach her constantly. Celeste thinks he is the stalker, but Tasha tells her he couldn't be. What Celeste doesn't know is that Tasha is meeting Brent secretly, and is trying to seduce him. He is only interested in Celeste, however, and wants to protect her against the stalker.
Celeste is unable to block the stalker's calls, and he becomes angry with her ignoring him. He warns her not to block his calls, not to call the police, and not to have a boyfriend. He threatens to punish her if she disobeys. Celeste ignores his warnings and contacts a detective. She also purchases a telescope to attempt to find the stalker herself. However, the stalker knows Celeste contacted the police, and calls to inform her that she will be punished. Later, returning home, Celeste finds that her curtains have been removed, and she has a voicemail message from the stalker saying that he could be anywhere in her house. Afraid, Celeste immediately leaves the apartment and contacts the police. However, her house boss later tells her that he took the curtains down because they weren't functioning correctly.
One night, Celeste receives another phone call and tries to locate the stalker while he is talking. Believing she has found him, she contacts her house boss. He tells her that what is happening to her also happened to a woman named Justine Jamison, who vanished one day and was never heard from again. Celeste trusts her hotel guard, Derreck, with her suspicions about the stalker's identity, and he reluctantly sneaks her into her suspect's apartment. She finds out that a man named David Jacobson lives there. Later, two investigators, Detective Gillis and Detective Zamora, pay David a visit and find pictures secretly taken from Celeste. Although David swears he has never seen the pictures, he is taken to the police station.
Celeste reunites with Brent, but she receives another threatening call from the stalker ordering her to get rid of Brent. The stalker says he will get rid of Brent if she doesn't. Celeste's fear returns as she realizes that David can't be the caller, because he is in jail. She tries to contact Justine Jamison, the previous stalking victim, but is unable to reach her. Returning home, Celeste realizes her pet bird is missing. 
Later, as she discovers that the stalker has put cameras in her house, Celeste is interrupted with a phone call from Justine. They meet and she tells Celeste that the stalker killed her fiancee. Not much later, the stalker also threatens to kill Brent. In addition, he sends a video message of Celeste's bird, threatening to kill and eat the pet.
In the climactic scene, Derreck leads Celeste to the basement, telling her it is the stalker's hiding place. The stalker is then revealed to be Derreck. Brent, who has also come to the basement, gets into a fight with Derreck. Celeste intervenes just as Derreck is about to kill Brent by hitting the stalker in the head with a pole. The police arrest Derreck. Celeste and Brent are finally set free.

The Hajji Abdul Rahman Mosque (Dari: مسجد حاجی عبدالرحمان; ), also known as the Grand Mosque of Kabul, is one of the largest mosques in Afghanistan. It is located in one of Kabul's commercial areas called "Deh Afghanan", near the Pashtunistan Square and across from the once popular "Plaza Hotel". The building is a three story, which is built on 3.5 acres of land. One floor of the building is dedicated to women only.
The mosque is named after an influential Afghan businessman named Hajji Abdul Rahman who has died but his sons continued the project. Construction of the mosque began in 2001 by Hajji Abdur Rahman but was delayed for several years due to red tape. The mosque has the capacity to serve 10,000 people at a time. There is also a madrasa inside the mosque and a library containing 150,000 books.
The major work on the mosque was completed in late 2009 but the official inauguration took place in July 2012 in which Afghan President Hamid Karzai and many other high-ranking officials attended. The building of the mosque is said to have been initially designed by Afghan architect Mir Hafizullah Hashimi.

Jama Masjid of Herat

The Jama Masjid of Herat (مسجد جمعه هرات), also known as the Masjid-i Jami' of Herat, and the Great Mosque of Herat is a mosque in the city of Herat, in the Herat Province of north-western Afghanistan. It was built by Ghurids, the famous Sultan Ghayas-ud-Din Ghori, who laid its foundation in 1200 AD, and later extended by several rulers as Herat changed rulers down the centuries from the Timurids, to the Safavids, to the Mughals and the Uzbeks, all of whom supported the mosque. Though many of the glazed tiles have been replaced during subsequent periods, the Great Mosque in Herat was given its present form during the closing years of the fifteenth century.
Apart from numerous small neighborhood mosques for daily prayer, most communities in the Islamic world have a larger mosque, a congregational mosque for Friday services with a sermon. The Jama Masjid was not always the largest mosque in Herat; a much larger complex the Mosque and Madressa of Gawharshad, also built by the Timurids, was located in the northern part of the city. However, those architectural monuments were dynamited by officers of the British Indian Army in 1885, to prevent its use as a fortress if a Russian army tried to invade India.
History.
The Masjid-i Jami of Herat, the city's first congregational mosque, was built on the site of two smaller Zorastrian fire temples that were destroyed by earthquake and fire. A mosque was begun by the Ghurid ruler Ghiyas ad-Din Ghori in 1200 (597 AH), and, after his death, the building was continued by his brother and successor Muhammad of Ghor. This is confirmed both by an inscription on the eastern Ghurid portal uncovered in 1964 during a restoration, and by the sixteenth century Timurid historian Khwandamir in his "Khulasat al-Akhbar".
Timurids.
In 1221, Genghis Khan conquered the province, and along with much of Herat, the small building fell into ruin. It wasn't until after 1245, under Shams al-Din Kart that any rebuilding programs were undertaken, and construction on the mosque was not started until 1306. However a devastating earthquake in 1364 left the building almost completely destroyed, although some attempt was made to rebuild it. After 1397, the Timurid rulers redirected Herat's growth towards the northern part of the city. This suburbanization and the building of a new congregational mosque in Gawhar Shad's Musalla marked the end of the Masjid-i Jami's patronage by a monarchy. Replacement of the small ruined mosque was done by construction of an entirely new building with surrounding gardens, which was completed by Jalal al-Din Firuzshah, one of the most prominent emirs under Shah Rukh (1405–1444). The decorations alone took over five years to complete, as the emir brought in workers from all over the empire. The mosque was later given a final renovation under the Mughal Empire, when Prince Khurram (Shah Jahan) was fighting for control of the region against the Uzbek tribes.
19th and 20th Centuries.
Little of the medieval Mosque remains, after the Anglo-Afghan wars much of the mosque was left destroyed. A program launched in 1945 rebuilt walls and rooms, expanded the northeastern section of the mosque from a length of approximately 101 meters to 121 meters and replaced expensive materials from all over the medieval Timurid and Mughal Empires with locally available cheap materials. Overall, the mosque's multiple reconstructions and restoration programs have left little to authenticate as original. However the inscribed Ghorid portal remains, south of the existing main entrance to the mosque.
In 2012, some fifty Afghan traders promised funds for the renovation of the mosque.
Description.
The Great Mosque is laid out in the traditional rectangular iwan pattern, with three walls and a huge central courtyard. Some of the original decoration remains in the center section, but much has been replaced.

Positive pressure enclosure

__NOTOC__
A positive pressure enclosure, also known as an isolation chamber, is a chamber used to provide a safe work environment for performing hot work in the presence of explosive gases or vapours. They are used most often in conjunction with the need for welding, and are often associated with the offshore oil industry.
A positive pressure enclosure works by providing a constant inflow of breathable atmosphere, which in turn causes gas to continuously leak out of the chamber. This outflow of gases prevents the ingress of explosive gases or vapours which are often present in such work locations. This constant outflow of gases from the chamber also serves to cleanse the air within of the undesirable gaseous by-products of the welding process. Most commercial versions of positive pressure enclosures are referred to by their manufacturers as "habitats".
Operating principles.
Flammability limits.
Flammable gases are not generally explosive under all conditions, and indeed, must be present within specific ranges in order to be explosive, or flammable. Additionally, oxygen must be present. The flammability limits of gases are expressed in proportions to the other gases present. For example, for methane, the lower explosive limit (LEL) is 4.4% and the upper explosive limit (UEL) is 17%. A positive pressure enclosure works by making sure that the methane present in the work area never approaches the 4.4% LEL.
Government regulations in the European Union and in North America define the safety requirements for workers working in the presence of flammable gases. In Europe, these regulations are found in the ATEX directives, and in the United States, in the National Electrical Code.
Positive pressure.
The operating pressure inside a typical isolation chamber is set only marginally above local pressure; typically only 0.05 kilopascals (about 0.007 pounds per square inch) above local atmospheric pressure. This is sufficiently low to be undetectable (a person sitting in a bathtub full of water is exposed to greater pressures) to operators working inside the enclosure, but due to the leaky nature of the unit, ensures that the volume of air inside is constantly and rapidly changing. Intake air is piped into the enclosure by fan units.

Bamyan Airport

Bamyan Airport is an airport serving the city of Bamyan in Afghanistan.
It is sited alongside a large military base which, until April 2013, was known as Forward Operating Base Kiwibase and was home to coalition troops including USA, New Zealand, and Malaysia, as well as a detachment of police from Europe (EUPOL) and various aid agencies, and was the base of the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team (NZPRT) run by New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
The airport is used by small fixed wing aircraft, larger aircraft capable of short take off and landing (including C130 Hercules), and rotary wing aircraft. A number of civilian airlines including Embassy Air land at Bamyan as well as various aid agencies and military forces.
Coalition rotary aircraft usually land within the confines of the adjacent Kiwibase which has a fuel farm capable of refuelling aircraft.
Bamyan is a very challenging airport to land and take off from. The airport consists of a long dirt and gravel airstrip, on which aircraft have been known to suffer punctures. Aircraft usually land from the East regardless of wind conditions due to the high cliffs off the North Western corner. It is at an altitude of approximately 2591m above sea level, meaning the air is much thinner and the weather more extreme than at sea level.
It is frequently closed by snow in the winter and can reach temperatures as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the winter and 40 degrees Celsius in the summer. It has no terminal buildings. It is approximately 2595m long 23m wide and fenced by chain link fences approximately 2.5m high. Along the length of this fence are several gates which remain open when the runway is not in use, and local residents cross the runway freely as a main thoroughfare from the southern part of Bamyan City to the main Bazaar. The gates are secured by NZPRT soldiers using padlocks when aircraft are due to land. The soldiers are then required to maintain a security patrol to prevent the fence being breached by inconvenienced locals who may try to cross in the path of aircraft, and more serious breaches to the security of the aircraft.
The runway has a slight bend in it approximately half way down which adds to the challenges faced by pilots during take off and landing. The bend also means that a section of the chain link fence is incomplete on the southern side of the airfield to enable an aircraft wing to pass over a steep drop off into a gully to the south. This section is loosely and ineffectively strung with Razor Wire. Local residents frequently use this week point to cross the runway when it is closed, only to be stuck on the northern side where the fence is mostly complete.
Chinese interests are currently investigating the development potential of Bamyan Airport to further exploit their interest in the coal mines in Northern Bamyan.

William Green (1760–1823) was an English artist, poet, writer, and landscape painter, who made images mainly of the Lake District, determined to make them "adhere as faithfully as possible to nature." His biographer, Charles Roeder, stated: "his novel method is notable, as the artists have all a conventional and uniform style in regard to the representation of mountains. Those of Mr Green are veritable mountains; he says that he knows their anatomy and he is undoubtedly right."
In 1819, Green completed a major work, "The Tourist's New Guide to the Lake District." But he became troubled, and by 1820 his constitution was weakened.

Martin T

__NOTOC__
The Martin T was a training biplane produced in the United States in 1913 for military use. It was a conventional, three-bay biplane with unstaggered wings of equal span. The pilot and instructor sat in tandem, open cockpits with dual controls. Fixed, tricycle undercarriage was fitted which could be exchanged for a single pontoon under the fuselage and wingtip floats.
Early examples were delivered to the Army without engines, so that the Army could power them with engines salvaged from other aircraft, but later TTs came equipped with Curtiss, Hall-Scott, or Sturtevant engines.
In 1915, a Model TT was piloted by Oscar Brindley to win the Curtiss Marine Trophy for the longest flight within ten consecutive hours in the one day, covering 444 mi (710 km).
The Model T was the basis for the Martin S Hydro seaplane, with a lengthened fuselage, a greater span, and upper wing ailerons.

Airship Ventures Inc. was a private company that offered sight-seeing rides (which the company called "flightseeing") in a 12-passenger Zeppelin NT out of a World War II United States Navy hangar at Moffett Federal Airfield near Mountain View, California.
, their airship, built by Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH, is in a state of disassembly, but is still one of three zeppelins in the world. The ship was dedicated and christened "Eureka" at the 75th anniversary celebration for Moffett Field on November 21, 2008; its flight from Beaumont, Texas, where it was shipped, to the Bay Area was the first zeppelin flight in the United States in 71 years.
At long, it was the largest airship in the world until the U.S. Army's LEMV had its maiden flight in 2012.
The company was owned by the husband and wife team of Alexandra and Brian Hall of Los Gatos, California. Alexandra Hall previously ran the Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland, California. Two of their pilots, Katherine "Kate" Board (who left the company to fly another Zeppelin NT in Germany) and Andrea Deyling, are the only female zeppelin pilots in the world.
Airship Ventures was based out of the Bachelor Officer Quarters in Building 20 in the NASA Research Park. The airship was stored in the WWII era Hangar Two - a former blimp hangar.
On November 14, 2012, the company announced that it was closing its doors and grounding flight operations due to a lack of long-term sponsorship. In mid-December the decision was announced to wind up the company and dissassemble the "Eureka", which was shipped back to Germany.

Miller Cabin

The Miller Cabin complex consists of three buildings that were the residence of Robert A. Miller, the first superintendent of Teton National Monument. A house, a barn and a cabin built by the U.S. Forest Service are included. The property was eventually transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in what became the National Elk Refuge. The buildings are a component of the closely related Grace and Robert Miller Ranch.
Robert Miller was born in Wisconsin in 1863, and took up permanent residence in Jackson Hole in 1885, settling on land along Flat Creek. A prominent local citizen, Miller helped to organize the town of Jackson, Wyoming in 1901 and was president of the local bank. His wife served two terms as mayor of Jackson in the 1920s. Miller was chosen by Abraham Archibald Anderson, administrator of the new Yellowstone Timberland Reserve to be administrator of the Teton Division of the reserve from 1903, running the operation from his cabin.
As a result of local rancher, photographer and Wyoming legislator S.N. Leek's efforts, the National Elk Refuge was established in 1912 from nearly of Miller's land, and was administered from the house adjoining Miller's cabin.
The original cabin was Miller's home during his time with the Forest Service. The adjoining two story house was used as the headquarters for the National Elk Refuge in its early years.

The Indian Institute of Technology Ropar (IIT Ropar), sometimes referred to as Indian Institute of Technology Punjab (IIT Punjab), is an engineering and technology higher education institute located in Rupnagar, Punjab, India. It is one of the eight new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) established by the Ministry of Human Resource Development MHRD, Government of India under The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011 which declares these eight IITs as well as the conversion of Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University to IIT. The Act was passed in the Lok Sabha on 24 March 2011 and by the Rajya Sabha on 30 April 2012.
History.
This new institute was established by MHRD in year 2008. The classes for academic session 2008–2009 were held at IIT Delhi. The Institute started functioning from its transit campus in Rupnagar in August 2009.
Campus & Location.
IIT Ropar is located at Rupnagar (formerly known as Ropar) town of the district Rupnagar. Rupnagar was founded in the 11th century and named after Rup Sen son of Raja Rokeshar. Recent excavations and explorations conducted at Rupnagar indicate that the first settlements here were the Harappans, who reached the upper Satluj towards the close of third millennium B.C. The district has rich historical and religious significance.
Rupnagar town is the headquarters of district Rupnagar and is located 42 km. from Chandigarh, the state capital. It is connected by road on National Highway NH-21. The Delhi-Ambala-Una railway line passes through Rupnagar and provides rail connectivity. The nearest airport is at Chandigarh at a distance of about 60 km. The Satluj river passes close to Rupnagar.
The climate is characterised by its general dryness, except during the south-west monsoon season, a hot summer and a cold winter. The winter is from mid-November to February, summer from March to June and the monsoon from late June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall in the district is about 776 mm with about 78% in the period of June to September.
Permanent campus.
The location for permanent campus of IIT Ropar is Birla Seed Farms, Rupnagar. The Government of Punjab has approved about land for the permanent campus in Rupnagar. Foundation stone for the permanent campus of IIT Ropar was laid down on 24 February 2009 by former Union HRD Minister Mr. Arjun Singh.
Temporary campus.
The temporary campus of IIT Ropar is former Women's Polytechnic, Rupnagar. The academic and administration buildings of the Women's Polytechnic were completely renovated to accommodate all the requirements of the Institute . It has all the basic infrastructure to run Academic programmes specially designed by IIT Delhi. The transit campus is equipped with state of art lecture halls along with well 
maintained playgrounds to nurture the bright minds and enhance their overall development. Special emphasis has been laid to set up advanced laboratories to help students gain practical insight of the courses that are a part of their curriculum.
The current temporary campus is a brief 1 km walk from Rupnagar railway station.
Academic system.
The curriculum followed at IIT Ropar provides for a science-based engineering education, with a view to produce quality engineer-scientists. If facilitates broad-based knowledge acquisition and, simultaneously, nurtures a temper for lifelong learning and exploration. Students are encouraged to go beyond the classroom to conduct and carry out independent work by means of research projects, guided reading, and by allowing them to join the research activities undertaken by faculty members. The idea behind such a fashioning of the curriculum is the belief that classroom activities must be supplemented by independent study and also by individual research that broadens one's horizon and provides for opportunities to bring one's ideas to fruition.
The academic programme at the institute follows a semester-based credit system. The prominent feature of the credit system is the process of continuous evaluation of a student's performance and the flexibility to allow a student to progress at an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience, subject to fulfilling minimum requirements for continuation. A minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) is necessary for satisfactory progress and continuation in the programme.

Zwolle railway station

Zwolle is a railway station in Zwolle, Netherlands. The station opened on 6 June 1864 and is on the Utrecht–Kampen railway, also known as the "Centraalspoorweg", the Zwolle–Almelo railway, the Arnhem–Leeuwarden railway, the Zwolle–Emmen railway and the Lelystad–Zwolle railway, also known as the "Hanzelijn".
The station is a major hub for the Northern Netherlands. It is the only way trains can get from the north of the country, to any other region of the Netherlands.
ZwolleSpoort.
On August 31, 2010, the principal stakeholders in the railway station (Prorail, the Dutch Railways and the municipality of Zwolle) started the "ZwolleSpoort" project. This project will result in a major renovation of the existing station, an increase in capacity and an overhaul of the entire public transportation organization in the city. The main reason for the project is the Hanzelijn project, which is expected to increase the passenger traffic by 33% in the period up to 2020. In order to deal with the extra traffic, the passenger tunnel (currently 5 meters wide) in the station will be replaced by a new tunnel 17 meters wide and 120 meters long. The new tunnel will lead onto a new public transportation terminal at the southern end of the station, which will be the main crossroads of the city buses, regional buses and the future tramline to the town of Kampen.. The tunnel will also feature shopping facilities.
The project also entails increasing the capacity and efficiency of the railway emplacement. The new Hanzelijn will be accommodated by a new, fourth railway platform and the 34 points near the station will be replaced by 15 longer ones which will allow a more efficient railway pattern and allow trains to pass at higher speeds.
Train services.
The following train services currently call at Zwolle:
Bus services.
Many bus services also depart from the bus stations outside the station. These include services all over the city and regional services to Harderwijk, Apeldoorn, Urk, Steenwijk, Meppel, Coevorden, Ommen, Raalte and Deventer. "NS" (e.g. Steenwijk NS) means this service calls at the railway station (e.g. in Steenwijk).

Army of the Centre

The Army of the Centre ("armée du Centre") was one of the first French Revolutionary Armies, named after the location it was set up, the Centre region. It was created by order of king Louis XVI of France on 14 December 1791 and attached to Champagne. It had only an ephemeral existence after the battle of Valmy and the Prussians' evacuation of the territory.
Its name reflects its position occupying the centre of the French order of battle on the northern and eastern frontiers, between the armée du Nord and armée du Rhin, the 3rd and 4th military divisions on their creation, then also the 2nd division from 23 March.
By a National Convention decree of 1 October 1792, it was renamed the armée de la Moselle, but remained known as the armée du Centre whilst Kellermann was at its head (i.e. until 7 November 1792).

Digital Personal Workstation

The Digital Personal Workstation is a family of entry-level to mid-range workstation computers developed and manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). These workstations are based on the DEC Alpha and Intel Pentium Pro or Pentium II microprocessors. Members of this family could run the Digital UNIX, OpenVMS and Microsoft Windows NT operating systems.
The i-Series, based on Pentium Pro, was introduced first, on 23 September 1996.
i-Series.
The Digital Personal Workstation i-Series was based on the Intel Pentium Pro or Pentium II microprocessor and ran Windows NT.
Models included the:
These workstations supported either one or two microprocessors and used standard Intel chipsets: Pentium Pro models used the Intel 440FX, Pentium II models suffixed with "i" used the Intel 440BX whereas ones suffixed with "i+" used the Intel 440LX. A superscript "2" suffix indicated a dual processor configuration.
The i-Series has four DIMM slots on its main logic board and supported standard unbuffered or registered 100 MHz ECC SDRAM DIMMs. Using unbuffered memory, the i-Series could support 32 to 512 MB of memory, with registered memory, 64 MB to 1 GB was supported. Unbuffered and registered DIMMs could not be mixed in the same system. Unbuffered DIMMs had capacities of 32, 64 and 128 MB, whereas registered DIMMs had capacities of 64, 128 and 256 MB.
a-Series.
The Digital Personal Workstation a-Series, code named ""Miata"", used the Alpha 21164A microprocessor. Models suffixed with "a" ran Windows NT (with AlphaBIOS) whereas models suffixed with "au" ran Digital UNIX or OpenVMS (with SRM). At COMDEX 1997, the Digital Personal Workstation 500a was a finalist in Byte Magazine's Best of Show award for the best workstation category.
Models included the:
The Alpha microprocessor was socketed in a zero insertion force (ZIF) socket and could be upgraded. These workstations used Digital's 21174 chipset, also known as the "Pyxis" chipset. To increase flexibility and to reduce cost, the L3 cache was optional in these models. If the L3 cache was required, a cache module that contained the SRAMs which implemented the cache would be installed into a cache slot. The cache module had two capacities: 2 or 4 MB.
Two revisions of the "Miata" motherboard were produced, known as "MX5" and "MiataGL" respectively. The later MiataGL motherboard has a revised Pyxis chipset (which fixes a PCI DMA bug), a different ATA controller, an on-board QLogic 1040 SCSI host adapter, and a USB interface.
The a-Series has a 144-bit memory bus, with 128 bits used for data and 16 bits for ECC. There are three memory banks, each consisting of two DIMM slots, for a total of six DIMM slots, which supports 32 MB to 1.5 GB of memory. The a-Series uses proprietary 72-bit DIMMs with error correcting code (ECC) that are twice as tall as standard DIMMs and contain two rows of SDRAMs per a column instead of one. These DIMMs are installed in identical pairs in order to match the width of the memory bus.

Higginbotham's

The Higginbotham's is an Indian company of book sellers and publishers based in the city of Chennai. The main bookstore at Mount Road, Chennai has the reputation of being India's oldest bookshop in existence.
History.
An English librarian named Abel Joshua Higginbotham established The Higginbotham's after allegedly arriving in India as a British stowaway. In the 1840s he found employment as a librarian with a bookstore named Weslyan Book Shop run by Protestant missionaries. However, the store suffered heavy losses and the missionaries who ran the business decided to sell their shop for a low price. Higginbotham purchased the business, set up his own store and called it "Higginbotham's" in the year 1844. The Higginbotham's is, therefore, India's oldest bookstore in existence. It soon gained a reputation for quality. John Murray, in his "Guidebook to the Presidencies of Madras and Bombay" in 1859, describes Higginbotham's as the "premier bookshop of Madras". In March 1859, in a letter to Lord Macaulay, Lord Trevelyan, the Governor of Madras wrote:
The Higginbotham's started selling stationery and also publishing and printing their own books from the 1860s onwards. When the British Crown took over the governance of India from the British East India Company by the Queen's Proclamation of 1858, Higginbotham's printed copies of the Proclamation in English and Tamil and distributed them all over the Presidency. The Higginbotham's were appointed as the "official booksellers to His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales" during the latter's visit to India in 1875. Its first publication ‘Sweet Dishes: A little Treatise on Confectionary' by Wyvern, came out in 1884.

Begijnhof Chapel, Amsterdam

The Begijnhof Chapel, dedicated to Saint John and Saint Ursula, is a Roman Catholic chapel run by the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, in the St Nicholas Parish of Amsterdam. It is located in a former schuilkerk in the Begijnhof across from its original location, the English Reformed Church, Amsterdam. The Miracle of Amsterdam is commemorated yearly with a procession starting from this church.
History.
Around 1150, a group of women came together to live in a religious community, primarily to look after the sick. These were the first 'Beguines’ although the name was not yet used. The women were not nuns and nor did they live in the seclusion of a convent. They had no founders nor did they make lifelong vows. They were unmarried women who made a vow of chastity and promised obedience to the parish priest, but since they were not expected to make a vow of poverty, they were free to dispose of their own possessions as they wished. They could renounce their vows at any moment and leave the Beguinage, for instance, to get married. We do not know exactly when the Beguinage was founded. According to the Amsterdam City Archives, the first time the word ‘beguines’ was used was in an official document of 1307 found in the accounts of the Bailiff of Amstelland. Another document, dated 31 July 1346, speaks of the Beghijnhuis (house of the Beguines) ceded to them by one Cope van der Laene on St Peter’s Eve.
The church of the Beguines.
As early as 1397 the Beguines had a small chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. On 17 October 1419, after the enlargement of the Beguinage, Matthias, titular Bishop of Biduane (a small town on the Adriatic), in his capacity as vicar-general of Frederic III, Bishop of Utrecht, solemnly consecrated a new chapel. This chapel, with its own burial ground, was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and the apostle Matthew.
The church was badly damaged during the two great fires of 23 April 1421 and 25 May 1452. After its restoration, it was re-dedicated. The Beguines themselves paid for the rebuilding and restoration.
When a Beguine died, she was buried in the church, as was common at the time. There was, however, one special, well-known exception: Mistress Cornelia Arens. In her lifetime, the church had turned from a Catholic to a Protestant place of worship, and so she refused to be buried in it, asking to be placed in the ‘wide church path near the gutter’. Despite her wish, when she died on 14 October 1654, she was at first buried in the church and only on 2 May 1655 was she reburied against the church wall outside. Later on, because of work on this wall, her grave was moved to the edge of the bleaching field. Every year on 2 May, her grave is still adorned with flowers.
The Alteration.
Until 1578, Amsterdam was almost completely Roman Catholic, with two large parish churches, six chapels and many monasteries and convents. Every year the worship of the Sacrament of the Miracle drew thousands of pilgrims to the city for the yearly procession known as the Stille Omgang. A fair grew up alongside, ensuring a flourishing economy.
In Amsterdam, the Protestant reformers were particularly opposed to the ‘idolatry’ of the Host and the ‘Roman Catholic concept’ of the Holy Mass. The Orangist Calvinists prevailed and on 26 May 1578, the Alteratie (transition of the municipality to the Protestant church) turned out badly for the Roman Catholics. In an unbloody revolution, the Protestants in Amsterdam took over power and the Catholic magistrates were dismissed. It was now strictly forbidden for Roman Catholics to openly profess their faith, which meant that all churches, monasteries and convents were confiscated by the authorities. The Amsterdam Protestant clergy were assiduous in denouncing every house used for "Paepse afgoderij" (Popish idolatry) to the authorities, but the authorities exercised a degree of restraint in acting on these denouncements. The Beguines, too, had to hand over the church in their courtyard. It was given to the English and has since been called the ‘English Reformed Church’. The Catholics established churches in their houses so that they could nevertheless profess their faith. 
The hidden church.
After the Beguines were obliged to surrender their church, they worshipped in the church sacristy, until this sacristy was in turn appropriated by the Protestant city council. Then they worshipped in one of the small houses in their hofje, not always the same one. The first steps in the construction of the present chapel were taken as early as 1665, after joining two of the hofje houses bought for that purpose at the initiative of parish priest Van der Mije (1665–1700); his nephew laid the foundation stone on 2 July 1671. The Protestant council members of the city of Amsterdam approved the building plans on condition that the building did not look like a church from the outside. The interior chapel was designed by the Catholic architect in Amsterdam, Philips Vingboons (1607–78), and was dedicated to St John the Evangelist and St Ursula. In its present form, it has a gallery with a left and a right section, resting on six wooden columns. The main altar has a painting depicting the Miracle of Amsterdam. Two side-altars have paintings by Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert. The current facade with its gothic-style leaded ogive windows dates only from the 19th century. When the present chapel was opened in 1682, 150 Beguines and 12 widows or single women lived in the Beguinage.
The chapel has undergone many changes. It was extended considerably to the right and the Beguines were given their own side chapel on the left. The façade was renewed and accessibility improved by building a porch. The interior of the chapel also underwent various changes in respect to the paintings, lamps, tabernacle, statues, and windows.
But throughout, the eucharistic reflection, prayer and silence were central.

Anchor (housing association)

Anchor is England’s largest not-for-profit housing association, providing housing, care and support to people over 55 years old. Registered as a charity, it is one of the largest in the UK, with a turnover of £264.9 million in 2012/13.
Anchor is headquartered in central London, with main offices located in Newcastle and Bradford. It employs over 9,000 people nationally and has a growing number of volunteers.
Its patron is Princess Alexandra.
History.
Anchor was established in 1968, as Help the Aged (Oxford) Housing Association, to provide sheltered housing to older people. By 1972, the organisation had completed its first new-build properties and begun diversifying into both leasehold and rented accommodation.
The organisation became Anchor Housing Association in 1975, and launched its first care homes in 1982.
Anchor has since continued to grow its existing services and diversify into new services such as retirement villages and extra-care housing, becoming a thought-leader in caring for individuals with dementia and promoting equality for minority groups, such as LGBT groups.
Anchor's multi award-winning Denham Garden Village – their largest development of retirement properties to date – opened in 2004.
In 2012 they opened West Hall a ground-breaking care home in West Byfleet in Surrey. In the same year it won the Best Interior Dementia Design category at the National Dementia Care Awards 2012.
The organisation rebranded from Anchor Trust to Anchor in 2010, adopting a new logo and refreshed brand image to reflect the range of services on offer.
Services.
Anchor currently offers three main services:
Governance.
Anchor is governed by a trustee board of seven non-executive directors, and an executive management board of sixexecutive directors. Anchor’s current Chief Executive, Jane Ashcroft CBE, who also chairs the English Community Care Association, was awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Social Care award at the Great British Care Home Awards 2010 in recognition of her "...the agenda on developing quality care services across the continuum of care." She also topped a high-profile list of the most influential people in social care at the Care Talk Awards 2012, and is a trustee of The Silver Line; a helpline for older people. Ashcroft is a graduate of the University of Stirling.
The non-executive board members are:
Anchor’s services are regulated by the Care Quality Commission, the Homes and Communities Agency and The Charity Commission.
Agenda and influence.
Anchor has frequently sought to use its profile to draw attention to issues within the care environment. The organisation has published white paper documents investigating ageism on television, lobbied parliament on the importance of older people's issues, and sought to underline the importance of person-centred care.
The organisation has also campaigned to highlight the importance of retaining residential scheme managers at retirement properties.
In 2011 Anchor launched The Grey Pride campaign, calling on government to appoint a Minister for Older People to prioritise the needs of older people and make sure their views and interests receive dedicated attention. The petition gathered 137,000 signatures and was handed in to Downing Street on Monday 28 November 2011. As a result of the campaign the shadow cabinet appointed Liz Kendall as Shadow Minister for Older People. Penny Mordaunt MP secured a debate on the topic in the House of Commons on Thursday 28 June 2012.
In June 2013 a charity single was released by The Anchor Community Band to celebrate the positive aspects of ageing and challenge stereotypes and misconceptions in a fun and inclusive way. More than 350 people from Anchor’s retirement housing and care homes were involved in recording the song and it raised over £15,000 for national charity Contact the Elderly.
Anchor’s specialist Dementia Team - headed by Victoria Metcalfe, previously Care Advisor to the Alzheimer’s Society - has provided advanced training for staff. Of the Department of Health’s stated goal of 3,000 Dignity Champions nationwide, Anchor has more than 500. As well as recognition for this training, Anchor has also received praise for its work in palliative care, and nutrition and catering.
Anchor were one of the first organisations to pioneer Your Care Rating, a groundbreaking customer satisfaction survey conducted by IpsosMORI in 2012.
The organisation is a member of the Care & Support Alliance and a founding member of the Associated Retirement Community Operators Limited (ARCO).

<doc id="19859405" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19859405" title="Chu Liuxiang">
Chu Liuxiang

Chu Liuxiang is the fictional protagonist of the "wuxia" novel series "Chu Liuxiang Series" () by Gu Long. He robs the rich to help the poor and upholds justice in the "jianghu". He is nicknamed "Daoshuai" (; Bandit Chief) or more popularly, "Xiangshuai" (; Chief Xiang). He is intelligent and observant, kind and compassionate. His name "Liuxiang" literally means "lingering fragrance".
Character description.
Chu is a martial arts expert whose prowess in "qinggong" is unmatched. He wields a fan as his weapon and uses it only for self-defence. He relies on his wit, experience and calm to solve several mysteries and overcome several enemies who are more powerful than him. The identity of Chu's martial arts teacher is unknown, and even the well-informed Shuimu Yinji could only deduce that he is a student of Ye Di (), a character from "Daqi Yingxiong Zhuan" ().
Chu's age is not specified in the novels, but he is estimated to be around 30 years old. In "Bianfu Chuanqi", Chu's childhood friend Hu Tiehua is said to be 33 years old. Chu's age is assumed to be close to Hu's.
Chu resides on a housebot called Xiang Boathouse (), which also functions as his headquarters. Living together with him are three women, who are the closest people to him apart from his best friends Hu Tiehua and Ji Bingyan. They accompany him together in "Tiexue Chuanqi". They come from pitiful backgrounds and have been following Chu on his adventures since they were 11 or 12. The first, Su Rongrong, is kind and understanding and specialises in the art of disguise. The second, Li Hongxiu, is very clear and alert and has a good memory. The third one, Song Tian'er, is a good cook and is the most mischievous and adorable of the three. Chu also meets several other beautiful maidens on his adventures, such as Heizhenzhu, Shi Xiuyun, Hua Zhenzhen, Dong Sanniang and Xinyue. He eventually marries Zhang Jiejie, whom he meets in "Taohua Chuanqi".
Chu has a wide network of friends. They include: Monk Wuhua, who becomes his foe later; Ji Bingyan, who appears cold and indifferent but is actually very warm-hearted; Zhongyuan Yidianhong, a powerful swordsman; Zuo Qinghou, the hospitable master of Zhibei manor; "Swift Net" Zhang San.
Novels.
Chu Liuxiang Chuanqi.
The three novels, "Xuehai Piaoxiang", "Da Shamo" and "Huameiniao", are collectively known as "Chu Liuxiang Chuanqi" novel series.
Xuehai Piaoxiang.
Chu Liuxiang steals a rare flower from the capital and brings it back to his boathouse to take care of it himself. He later sees the corpses of several top fighters in the "jianghu" drifting towards him. This arouses his interest and he decides to investigate their deaths. Meanwhile, the Heaven's One Holy Water () of the Holy Water Palace () is stolen and Chu becomes the suspect. Monk Wuhua is eventually revealed to be the mastermind behind all the mysterious events and murders. Chu confronts Wuhua and defeats him in a fight and the latter commits suicide.
Da Shamo.
Chu Liuxiang returns to his boathouse and discovers that Su Rongrong, Li Hongxiu and Song Tian'er are missing. The three maidens are the closest to him besides his friends and he knows that they will not leave without notifying him. He sets forth on a long journey in search of them and reaches a desert. He meets his friends Hu Tiehua and Ji Bingyan there. Through a series of adventures, Chu defeats Shi Guanyin and her son Wuhua, who is actually still alive. Shi Guanyin commits suicide after her defeat. However, Chu has not found the missing girls yet.
Huameiniao.
Chu Liuxiang has a series of adventures with Li Yuhan and his wife Liu Wumei. Liu was previously a student of Shi Guanyin. He engages Shuimu Yinji in a dramatic battle that shocks the entire "jianghu" and emerges victorious. Chu exposes an evil scheme in front of Li Yuhan's father Li Guanyu and rescues the three missing maidens.
Chu Liuxiang Xinzhuan.
The five novels, "Bianfu Chuanqi", "Guilian Xiaqing", "Taohua Chuanqi", "Xinyue Chuanqi" and "Wuye Lanhua", are collectively known as the "Chu Liuxiang Xinzhuan" novel series.
Guilian Xiaqing.
Chu Liuxiang encounters a pair of lovers who are forbidden to be together by their parents. The lovers pretend to have lost their souls after feigning illness so that they can trick their parents. Chu unravels the mystery behind the case and helps the lovers be together.
Taohua Chuanqi.
The end of this story resembles the famous paradox in the English short story "The Lady, or the Tiger?".
Xinyue Chuanqi.
The people living near the sea face constant raids from pirates. The imperial court dispatches the most famous sect in the "jianghu", Jade Sword Manor (), to eliminate the pirates. Unexpectedly, the elimination of the pirates leads to the emergence of a new pirate lord, Heavenly King Shi, who becomes the new threat on the high seas. To make peace with King Shi, the imperial court asks the Jade Sword Manor's leader to offer her daughter Princess Jade Sword's hand-in-marriage to King Shi. This arouses the attention of several martial artists and sects in the "jianghu". It is apparent that the "jianghu" is about to experience some turmoil soon. Chu Liuxiang seems to be the only one who can save them.

At the time of Mahmud of Ghazni's attack on the sub-continent, the state of Gujarat was held under a Rajput named Bheem Singh Solanki who is known to have been an enemy of the ruling Soomra Muslim tribes in Sindh.
Solangis are among oldest tribes of Sindh (i.e. Indus Valley Civilization and neighbouring civilizations). Solangis are found in great populations in virtually every town and District of Sindh. They also lived in the city of Karachi. The Solangi Jats of Dera Ghazi Khan, Vehari, Khanewal, Rajan Pur and Rahim Yar Khan also claimed connections with the Solangi tribe. Like other old Sindhi tribes, they are known under the common nomenclature of Sammat. They inhabited Sindh when the irrigation system was under development and canals were under construction.
The great Mughal said about Solangi, "Solangi is impossible to defeat in battle but easily to overcome by love".

The zodi is a unit of zodiacal dust. 
One zodi is the amount of interplanetary dust in the inner solar system. This dust absorbs light from the Sun and re-radiates it as thermal radiation. The luminosity of the zodiacal dust in the Solar System is about formula_1 relative to the luminosity of the Sun, and in practice, this is the observable characteristic defining one zodi.

Dennis Joseph Slamon (born August 8, 1948), is an American oncologist and chief of the division of Hematology-Oncology at UCLA. He is best known for his work identifying the HER2/neu oncogene that is amplified in 25-33% of breast cancer patients and the resulting treatment Herceptin.
Slamon is the son of a West Virginia coal miner. He attended Washington & Jefferson College for its pre-med program.
He currently serves as director of Clinical/Translational Research at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and as director of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program at JCCC. He is a professor of medicine, chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology and executive vice chair for research for UCLA's Department of Medicine. Slamon also serves as director of the medical advisory board for the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance, a fund-raising organization that promotes advances in colorectal cancer.
For 12 years, Dr. Slamon and his colleagues conducted the laboratory and clinical research that led to the development of the new breast cancer drug Herceptin, which targets a specific genetic alteration found in about 25 percent of breast cancer patients. To acknowledge Slamon's accomplishments, President Bill Clinton appointed Slamon to the three-member President's Cancer Panel in June 2000.
A 1975 honors graduate of the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine, Slamon earned his Ph.D. in cell biology that same year. He completed his internship and residency at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Clinics, becoming chief resident in 1978. One year later, he became a fellow in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at UCLA, Los Angeles. 
His life and research was the template for the plot of the film "Living Proof" (2008), starring Harry Connick, Jr..
Slamon and his colleagues set out to find ways to target their treatments. They took breast cancer cells and mimicked what was happening in their patients, looking at genetic alterations in the genes that regulate growth. One of them was a gene called HER-2, human epidermal growth factor receptor No. 2.
The researchers saw that women who had the HER-2 alteration weren't doing as well because they had a more aggressive tumor. That made it a logical target. Slamon's group found that when they added an antibody to the receptor that the gene made when it mutated, the tumor growth rate dropped dramatically.
The process of identifying the target and validating it in the laboratory worked not just for breast cancer, but for other major malignancies, he said. The UCLA researchers developed models for several cancers, seeing which antibodies worked and which didn't.
Slamon was given the Scheele Award in 2009.

Vittorio Foa

Vittorio Foa (September 18, 1910, Turin – October 20, 2008) was an Italian politician, trade unionist, journalist and writer.
Biography.
Foa was born in Turin in 1910 into a middle-class Jewish family.
In 1931, Foa graduated in Law at the University of Turin and worked in a bank. In 1933, he joined Giustizia e Libertà, an anti-fascist political movement. He was arrested by the OVRA in May 1935 and was condemned to 15 years in prison. He shared his cell with Ernesto Rossi, Massimo Mila and Riccardo Bauer.
Foa was released in August 1943. He joined the resistance movement and entered the Partito d’Azione (Action Party, PdA). As a PdA member, he joined the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale (National Liberation Committee, CLN)
On 2 June 1946, Foa was elected member of the Constituent Assembly and he became a member of the Commission of the Seventy. Foa’s name is linked to articles 39 and 40 of the Constitution dealing with the freedom of trade union organisation.
When the Partito d’Azione dissolved in 1947, Foa joined the Partito Socialista Italiano (Italian Socialist Party, PSI) and was elected an MP in 1953 (and again in 1958 and 1963). In 1957, he joined the left-wing trade union of Giuseppe Di Vittorio, the CGIL, and became an influential and highly charismatic trade union leader.
A leading intellectual of the Italian non-Communist left, Foa supported the theory of the political autonomy of the working class, which would later inspire the foundation of extra-parliamentary leftist groups (PSIUP, PdUP, DP).
At the end of the 1970s, Foa left the trade union and active political life to devote himself to historical research and publishing. He taught Modern History at the Universities of Modena and Turin and researched the history of the working class and of the trade unions. Publications of this period include "La Gerusalemme rimandata: Domande di oggi agli inglesi del primo Novecento" (1985), a study of English working class movements at the beginning of the twentieth century.
In the late 1980s, Foa played an active part in the re-thinking of the Italian left and took a keen interest in the debates within the Italian Communist Party. In 1987 he was elected Senator from the PCI’s list of candidates.
In 1992, Foa retired, dividing his time between Rome and Formia. One of his last public appearances took place in 2002, when Foa joined the “Manifestazione dei Girotondi”, a spontaneous civil movement that developed in 2002–2003 in several Italian towns.
Defined as “the critical voice of the Italian left”, Foa devoted his life to Italian and European politics in their widest sense, and constantly expressed his confidence in the young. From the role of the trade unions, to the place of science in our contemporary society, Foa’s interests embraced crucial aspects of modern life and society.
He died on October 20, 2008 in Formia.
On 21 October 2008, Italian newspapers were filled with tributes to Foa. In La Repubblica, the journalist Miriam Mafai recalled his impatience when asked what the beleaguered Italian left should do. “It’s a waste of time and sense to try to define a leftist identity” – Mafai recalled Foa saying – “You have to do what is right and necessary for the country. It is up to posterity to decide whether it came from the right or the left.”

Petar Gburčik

Prof. Petar Gburčik (Cyrillic: Петар Гбурчик)
(30 October 1931 - 29 October 2006) was a Serbian scientist and a Professor of Meteorology at the University of Belgrade. He was the author of first mathematical models of the numerical weather prediction, which were used operationally in the Weather Service of Yugoslavia from 1970 to 1977. In the same period he began modeling of the atmospheric diffusion of air-pollution and created the first model of the spatial distribution of air-pollution. The output of this model was used for the elaboration of the urban plan of Pančevo. For the actual research of the three-dimensional distribution of wind energy (on the territories of Belgrade and Serbia) he applied the integration of classic models with GIS technology.
Special area of his engagements were the intentionally and inadvertently modified climates, as well as their impact on the sustainable development. These modifications destabilize the climate system and lead to big material and social damage, due to the lack of possibility of weather control. Petar Gburčik proved this with his scientific papers on weather modifications and climate change.

Lmbatavank

Lmbatavank (; also Surb Stepanos meaning "Saint Stephen") is a church located on a hillside southwest of the town of Artik in the Shirak Province of Armenia. It was constructed in the 7th century and was dedicated to Saint Stephen.
Folklore.
Local folklore tells that Turkish invading forces tried to fire a cannon at the church of S. Stepanos. After firing twice at the structure and missing it, they tried once again and misfired the cannon in their own vicinity. The commander saw that what they were firing upon was actually a church and put a stop to the attack.
In more recent years, the church door is said to have been stolen by a man who was seen carrying it away on his back. When asked by the local residents, "What door is this?" he replied "The door to the church." They told him to bring it back, which he did. Since the door was taken from a holy place, it is said that he could not remove it from his back until he returned it to the church because it was stuck.
Architecture.
The church of S. Stepanos has a small cruciform central plan with a single octagonal drum and dome above. The dome is covered by an umbrella style roof, while the four arms of the church have gable roofs. There is one portal that leads into the building, and adjacent to the main entry to the church there is another doorless portal to a side chapel. Decorations are mostly circular shield type patterns on the exterior of the structure, and are limited to the saddles around some of the windows and to the eaves and cornices. Opposite the side of the church with the door there are some inscriptions that may be seen, along with a design of a hollow Cross pattée resting in the center of a circle located to the left of the lower window. This same cross design may be seen at other churches in the area of Artik, for example on the rear façade of the 5th century Surb Marine Church in the center of town. 
In the interior of the church are important frescoes that date to the 7th century. Upon the altar and to each side there are remnants depicting Jesus in the center surroundeded by symbols of heavenly powers. There is also an image of Surb Gevorg riding a horse while holding a staff topped with a cross.
Between 1955-1956 the church was partially reconstructed. Excavations took place during 1960 to clear out the area in front of the church, and under the stones a Bronze Age cemetery and khachkars were found. Some of these khachkars may still be seen in and along the retaining walls next to the church. Other tombstones are nearby.
