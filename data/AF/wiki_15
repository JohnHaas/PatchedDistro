HMS Ariel (1911)

HMS "Ariel" was an "Acheron"-class destroyer built in 1911, which served during the First World War and sank in 1918 after striking a mine. Named after Shakespeare's "airy spirit", or the biblical spirit of the same name, she was the tenth and last ship of the name to serve in the Royal Navy.
Construction.
With her sister, "Acheron", she was a "Thornycroft special", and as such was slightly longer and more powerful than the standard destroyer of her class. "Ariel" was laid down at the Woolston yard of John I. Thornycroft & Company, and launched on 26 September 1911. Capable of , she carried two guns, other smaller guns and torpedo tubes and had a complement of 70 men.
Career.
As part of the First Destroyer Flotilla, she was attached to the Grand Fleet in August 1914, and then to the Third Battle Squadron from the spring of 1916. Once converted to a minelayer in 1917, she became part of the 20th Flotilla.
Establishing the Heligoland Bight patrol.
On 5 August 1914, "Ariel" towed submarine to Terschelling. They were in company with cruiser and submarine . After releasing the tow, the two submarines conducted the first Heligoland Bight patrol of the war.
Battle of Heligoland Bight.
As part of the Harwich Force, the First Destroyer Flotilla took part in the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August. "Ariel" — under Commander Dashwood Moir — shared in the prize money for the battle.
Battle of Dogger Bank.
On 24 January 1915, "Ariel" took part in the Battle of Dogger Bank as part of the First Destroyer Flotilla, with as flotilla leader. "Aurora" was the first British ship to engage the German ships as she encountered Hipper's screening vessels at the Dogger Bank at 07:05.
Sinking of "U-12".
On 10 March, in company with her sisters and , "Ariel" was searching for a German submarine reported by the trawler "Man Island" near Aberdeen. At 10:10, "Attack" sighted and opened fire. "Ariel", commanded by Lt Cdr J V Creagh, sighted the submarine at 10:12 at about and all three destroyers turned towards it. "U-12" dived and raised her periscope, which "Ariel" sighted at a distance of . She turned to ram, sighting the conning tower under the water in the final moments before she struck the submarine at a fine angle. Within two minutes, the submarine had returned to the surface so that the crew could escape, but they found the conning tower hatch jammed, and most of the survivors managed their escape via the other hatches. The destroyers opened fire as the submarine lay on the surface, killing and injuring some of the escaping sailors. At 10:30, "U-12" sank approximately in position , and the destroyers picked up 10 survivors; 19 lives had been lost. The damage to "Ariel"s bow was so serious that she had to be towed into port.
Battle of Jutland.
"Ariel" was present at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Tippet as part of the First Destroyer Flotilla, led by .
Sinking of "UC-19".
On 6 December 1916, sank the Russian sailing ship "Ans". The P&O vessel "Kashmir" sent out a radio warning, and later the same day "Ariel"s lookouts spotted the conning tower of a submarine. A depth charge was dropped in the position of the submarine, but it failed to explode. "Ariel"s explosive paravane was deployed, and after an explosion at about , oil and bubbles were observed. Twenty-five German sailors were killed, and "UC-19" now lies in about of water in an approximate position of .
Conversion to minelayer.
In 1917, the "Acheron"-class destroyers , "Sandfly" and "Ariel" were converted to minelaying destroyers, capable of carrying 40 mines. "Ariel" served with the 20th Flotilla, and operated out of Immingham.
Minelaying operations in the Heligoland Bight.
The provision of converted minelaying destroyers and the availability of reliable H2-pattern mines allowed the greatest allied minelaying operation of the First World War — the attempt to close Heligoland Bight to German ships and submarines. "Ariel" — with her sisters — was employed on this work until the end of the war. On the night of 27–28 March 1918, while laying a barrier minefield north-west of Heligoland, "Ariel" — in company with "Ferret", , and — came upon three armed German trawlers. All three vessels were sunk and 72 prisoners were captured.
Loss.
On 2 August, while conducting minelaying in the western end of the Heligoland Bight, the V-class destroyer sank after striking a German mine. In attempting to exit the minefield, "Ariel" lost her bow and sank in less than an hour. 49 lives were lost, including her commanding officer, Lt. Frank A Rothera.

<doc id="19845079" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19845079" title="Fram Strait">
Fram Strait

The Fram Strait is the deepest gateway to the Arctic Ocean located between Greenland in the West and Svalbard in the East, the latitudinal boundaries are roughly 81°N and 77°N. With depths up to 2.6 km it is the only deep connection between the Arctic Ocean and the world ocean, namely the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea. Other gateways are the Barents Sea Opening (BSO), the Bering Strait and various small channels in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. They are all shallower or narrower than Fram Strait. The Fram Strait is named after the Norwegian ship "Fram".
Oceanographic situation.
Atlantic water.
Atlantic water is a water mass originating in the Atlantic and transported northward by the West Spitsbergen Current in the East of the strait. The sub-surface flow a strong seasonality with a minimal volume transport in winter. The relative warm Atlantic water also transports internal energy into the Arctic Ocean . The northward velocity is maximal in winter, the so-called "heat transport" is therefore highest in winter.
In the past century, the sea surface temperature at Fram Strait has on average warmed roughly 1.9°C (3.5°F), and is 1.4°C (2.5°F) warmer than during the Medieval Warm Period.
Polar water.
The East Greenland Current flows southward on the Greenland Shelf. The water mass is relatively fresh.
Sea ice.
The Fram Strait area is located downwind of the Transpolar Drift and therefore covered by multi-year ice in the West of the strait, next to the coast of Greenland. Approximately 90% of sea ice exported from the Arctic is transported by the Eastern Greenland Current.
The amount of sea ice passing through the Fram Strait varies from year to year and affects the global climate through its influence on thermohaline circulation. Sea ice essentially corresponds to fresh water, its salt content of 4 per mil compares to about 35 per mil for sea water.
Long-time observations.
The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and the Norwegian Polar Institute perform longterm monitoring studies in Fram Strait to obtain volume- and energy-budgets through this choke point. The observations also allow to assess the development of the Arctic Ocean as a sink for terrestrial organic carbon. 
The AWI maintains a transect of up to 16 moorings across Fram Strait since 1997 with a longitudinal spacing of roughly 25 km. In up to five different depths, the water velocity is observed using rotor current meters. Additional CTD-sensors log the temperature and the salinity of the water column. The costs of a mooring are high (around 50 k€), but the most expensive part of the monitoring is the deployment and recovery of the moorings, a single day of RV Polarstern costs more than 50 k€.
Past projects.
The ASOF-N project aimed measure time-series of ocean fluxes between the Arctic and the Atlantic. Part of the work was performed at Alfred Wegener Institute.
Future plans.
It is planned to convert combine biological measurements in the so-called "AWI back yard" (German: "Hausgarten") with the oceanographic measurements within a future cabled observatory Frontiers in Marine Arctic Monitoring (FRAM). The main advantage is "unlimited energy supply for scientific instruments" and "real-time data" acquisition.
Importance for climate.
Computer simulations suggest that 60 to 70% of the fluctuation of the sea ice flowing through the Fram Strait is correlated with fluctuation of 6–7 years in which the Icelandic Low Pressure system extends eastward into the Barents Sea.
The warming in this area has likely amplified Arctic shrinkage, and serves as a positive feedback mechanism for transporting more internal energy to the Arctic Ocean.

Össur is a global company in non-invasive orthopaedics. It develops, manufactures and sells bracing and support products, compression therapy, and prosthetics. The company’s headquarters are in Reykjavík, Iceland. The company also has operations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, with numerous distributors in other markets.
History.
Össur was founded in Iceland in 1971 by Össur Kristinsson, a prosthetist. His family owned the company until 1999, when it went public and was listed on the Iceland Stock Exchange. Initially, the company served only the domestic Icelandic market, and then began to export in 1986. There was expansion in the 1990s and an acquisition strategy in the 2000s. Össur grew from being a prosthetics workshop with a few employees to a high-tech company that employs a staff of around 2,300 in 18 locations around the world.
Acquisitions.
Since 2000, Össur has acquired 15 companies. All except for the Gibaud Group are fully integrated.
Operations.
Research and development.
Össur operates five research and development (R&D) departments, which are located in four countries and employ a total of 76 people. In-house R&D also partners with third parties, including universities and research companies. Össur invests in research and product development. In 2007, that investment amounted to 6 percent of the company’s total sales. The same year, 22 US patents were granted to Össur and 37 new applications filed. At the end of the year, Össur had 218 US, 26 European, and 103 granted international patents in its portfolio, together with 119 US and 239 pending applications world.
Össur is recognized by the World Economic Forum as a "Technology Pioneer", which means it has been identified as a company that is developing and applying the most innovative and transformational technologies.
Products.
Össur operates in three markets: bracing & support, compression therapy, and prosthetics. Össur’s Bionic Technology Platform is a part of the prosthetics market.
Bracing and support.
Össur manufactures a range of braces and support products for arms, legs, and torso. Products include Unloader One, a brace that provides a mechanical solution to knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. It separates bones when ligaments and cartilage are damaged and also prevents further damage to the joint. The firm also makes the CTi (formerly sold as the CTi2), a ligament brace for knees used for both rehabilitation and for injury prevention, as well as cervical collars.
Compression therapy.
Össur entered the compression therapy segment with the acquisition of the French company Gibaud. Products include bandages, tights, stockings, knee highs and stump socks.
Prosthetics.
Össur manufactures prosthetic limbs and joints, liners, sockets, locks and sleeves. Its products include Flex-Foot, a high performance foot made from 100% carbon fiber, a material used extensively in the aerospace industry for its strength and flexibility. The Flex-Foot Cheetah developed by medical engineer Van Phillips and worn by Alan Oliveira and other amputee athletes is a derivative of this product line. Össur also produces the Total Knee prosthetic, which possesses a "locking moment" which keeps the knee from collapsing when it is in full extension, Mauch Knee, which has a hydraulic system for fluid and natural gait, and Iceross silicone prosthetic liners, which provide an interface between the skin and the socket.
Bionic Technology Platform.
This platform focuses on restoring the anatomical function displaced by amputation by using intelligent structures in products that can respond in a human-like way. The division's products are Rheo Knee, a microprocessor swing and stance knee system which utilizes artificial intelligence, Power Knee, which works as an integrated extension of its user, synchronizing motion with that of the sound leg using motor power, and Proprio Foot, an intelligent and motor-powered foot module.
Sponsorship.
The firm's Team Össur comprises international athletes and performers and professionals who use Össur prosthetics. Under this program, Össur is a major sponsor of disabled athletes, including Paralympians and world record holders Oscar Pistorius, Sarah Reinertsen, Jody Cundy and Rudy Garcia-Tolson. The company has also sponsored Paralympian runner Brian Frasure, now a certified prosthetist and mentor to Oscar Pistorius, and Mike McNaughton, a Staff Sergeant in the Louisiana Army National Guard who lost his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan and was subsequently awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.

Quantum of Solace (soundtrack)

Quantum of Solace: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album which was released on 17 October 2008. The album contains the score composed by David Arnold. It is Arnold's fifth soundtrack for the James Bond franchise. His frequent collaborator Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the score.
Development.
David Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, said that "Quantum of Solace" director Marc Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on "Casino Royale", the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to "really work it out". He also said he would be "taking a different approach" with the score. Arnold composed the music based on impressions from reading the script, and Forster edited those into the film.
Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse recorded a demo track for the film, but Ronson explained Winehouse's well-publicized legal issues in the preceding weeks made her "not ready to record any music" at that time. It was announced Jack White of The White Stripes and Alicia Keys would collaborate on "Another Way to Die", which is the first duet in Bond music history, on 29 July 2008. They had wanted to work together for two years beforehand. The song was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee; White played the drums while Keys performed on the piano. The Memphis Horns also contributed to the track. White's favourite Bond theme is John Barry's instrumental piece for "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", and he watched various opening credit sequences from the series for inspiration while mixing the track.
The soundtrack was released by J Records, Keys' record label, though Keys appears on only one track. The track listing follows the order of the music's use within the film, with the exception of the title song being moved to the end of the album (in the film, it appears immediately after track 1). It is presented in the full-length single-release version, rather than the shorter mix heard over the film's opening titles. One notable omission is the fully orchestrated James Bond Theme, which features, as it did in "Casino Royale", only at the film's conclusion, but this time over the traditional gunbarrel walk-on-and-shoot as well as the start of the end titles. Another omission is Four Tet's instrumental closing theme that follows it, playing over the remainder of the credits and entitled "Crawl, End Crawl" within them. This track was later made available on iTunes. Other tracks listed are heard in the film (but not on the album) during scenes such as Dominic Greene's charity fundraising party "Jaime Cuadra - Cholo Soy", "Jaime Cuadra - Regresa", "Jaime Cuadra - El Provinciano"; and Puccini's opera "Tosca" forms the backdrop to a key sequence. "Vesper's Theme" from Arnold's "Casino Royale" soundtrack reappears at key moments in the film; it may be heard on the album in tracks 12, 15, 18 and 23.

Lincoln-Page PT

__NOTOC__
The Lincoln-Page PT was a trainer aircraft produced in the United States from 1929 to 1931.
Lincoln-Page were eager to take a share of the emerging trainer market. Using their Lincoln-Page LP-3 as a basis they set about designing the PT. The resultant aircraft was quite different from the LP-3, having tandem cockpits and a lengthened rear fuselage. The design bears a resemblance to the Swallow aircraft, partially from manager Victor Roos prior history with the company. Structure was standard for its day:- welded steel tube warren girder fuselage with spruce spars and basswood ribs for the wings. With the ubiquitous Curtiss OX-5 the PT proved quite versatile and able to perform basic aerobatic manoeuvers without too much effort. It was awarded ATC no 181 in July 1929.
The aircraft was also offered with a Curtiss OXX-6 100hp engine, but no evidence exists that any were produced. However, a later variant using a Kinner K-5 radial engine was named Lincoln PT-K. An example of this version is preserved at the EAA AirVenture Museum.

Nikos Mihas

Nikos Mihas (; born November 20, in Athens, Greece) is a Greek singer-songwriter of the new age of Greek rock stars.
Early life.
From an early age he showed an interest in music. He started by playing the piano at the age of 10 and a few years later he formed a band with his brother and some friends. The band was called "NIMA" (derived from the first letters of their names, NIkos-MAkis). Some years later he went to Romania to study Medicine and become a doctor. He never left his dream however, which was to become a singer, so he entered the TV talent show "Fame Story 2".
Fame Story (2004).
In 2004, he decided to take part in the talent show "Fame Story 2", shown on the Greek TV channel ANT1, where he was one of the favourites to make it to the finals due to his unique style of performing and his low-profile character. One week before the final, however, he was eliminated from the show but for the first time in a Greek talent show he performed a song that he wrote; a move that many other contestants followed in the years to come. "Party" was a huge success at the time, even without being physically released in the music market.
Professional Career (2005-).
A year after, in the summer of 2005, he saw the release of his first personal album. It was called "Sti Hora Tou Pote" ("Into Neverland") and included many major hit-singles. It contains 12 songs written mostly by him and his band and with contributions of other songwriters.
In March 2007 his second album "Trehei Tipota?" was released. It contains 12 songs in a rock-alternative style including some beautiful ballads. The album also contains a cover of the 3 Doors Down song "When I'm Gone" in Greek lyrics. The record has received mixed reviews from Greek critics.
He is currently in progress of releasing his third album.
In early 2010, "Poso Sou Moiazo" was released as a digital single and video.
Awards.
MAD Video Music Awards.
The MAD Video Music Awards are awarded annually by the Greek music channel MAD TV since 2004. Nikos Mihas has received 2 awards from 5 nominations.

Fame (2009 film)

Fame is a 2009 American musical drama film and a loose remake of the 1980 film of the same title. It was directed by Kevin Tancharoen and written by Allison Burnett. It was released on September 25, 2009 in the USA, Canada, Ireland, and the UK. The movie follows NYC talents attending the New York City High School of Performing Arts (known today as Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School), where students get specialized training that often leads to success as actors, singers, etc.
Plot.
Auditions.
During the opening scenes in auditions and orientation, it is told that in 1936, New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia founded the High School of Music & Art in order to provide a facility where the most gifted and talented public school students of New York City could pursue their talents in art or music, while also completing a full academic program of instruction. In 1948, the School of Performing Arts was created to provide training in performance skills to students who wished to prepare for professional careers in dance, music or drama.
Freshman year.
Students learn on the first day of classes that their teachers expect them to know everything. In dance class, the teacher Ms. Kraft is worried about Kevin's dancing, but is easily impressed by Alice.
In acting class, Jenny feels uncomfortable to let loose and be crazy like everyone else. In music class, Mr. Cranston gives Victor pointers, while Denise plays the music perfectly on the piano.
In the lunchroom, everyone practices their major and they all get up and dance ('This Is My Life'), while Denise and Malik escape the madness and they talk to each other, Denise saying that her uptight and conservative parents thinks that the school is "people sitting around, practicing cello all day", and that they would die if they saw this. Malik reveals that his mother doesn't even know that he is coming to the school because she works three jobs and would never notice.
Just before freshman year ends, it shows Malik at his apartment, his mother finding his report card, making it clear that he goes to P.A. She is angry but he continues to go to the school. The year closes after she goes to work and leaves Malik standing alone.
Sophomore year.
As the new school year begins, it shows the dancers all practicing in a circle, but once it is Kevin's turn, he is out-shined and is forced to go back in his original spot.
In music class, Victor is having trouble sticking to the right music, and adds his own spin on whatever he is playing, which doesn't sit well with Mr. Cranston.
In theater class, Malik talks about his dead sister, Ayanna, causing Mr. Dowd to ask questions that he refuses to answer. Malik then leaves, stating that he's going to be famous, no matter what anyone else says.
Meanwhile, Denise is playing her classical piano, but then starts to sing, assuming she is alone. ('Out Here on My Own') When she leaves, it is revealed to the audience that Malik was watching the whole time. He brings her to Victor and convinces her to sing for the album that they are producing. She agrees to it, as long as her strict father doesn't find out.
At a Halloween party, Malik plays the song, but says the vocals are "anonymous", upsetting Denise, which confuses Malik. Later, Joy is in Central Park drinking beer. She gets up and does a rap, vomiting at the end of it. Neil captures this in his documentary and presents it to the class. Marco asks Jenny out on a date (though not for the first time). She agrees to go with him to dinner at his father's restaurant, where she convinces him to play a song and sing on the piano. He does ('Try'), and she gives him a money tip. The sophomore year portion of the movie ends with them kissing.
Junior year.
Joy has another audition, but is annoyed, because the other girls competing against her always seem to get the part. Neil says that he is meeting with a producer for a short, independent film he wrote and hopes to direct himself.
Meanwhile, Marco and Jenny go to a party, where Jenny sees a guy named Andy Matthews, a former P.A. student who claims to be a professional actor and known player. He tells her that he can have her meet with his agent, and the naive Jenny gives him her cell phone number. Marco leaves, having seen the last part, and Jenny runs out after him. They have a minor fight, but she promises that she will never talk to Andy again, and they go back to her house.
Victor, Malik, and Denise meet with a man from a record company, who says that their demo is interesting, and he will play it at the next meeting and get back to them. Victor and Malik are overjoyed, but Denise is still hesitant. At the next meeting, the producer tells them that Denise is the reason he was interested in their music. He tries to persuade her to stay.
Joy tells Jenny and Neil that she got a part-time acting job on 'Sesame Street' and is very excited about it. Ms. Rowan, the voice teacher, takes some of the students to a karaoke bar where she ends up singing as well. Jenny goes to meet Andy despite what she said to Marco. When she arrives, Andy tells her the director is out sick. He comes onto her, but she stops him and angrily leaves. She tells Marco, and he asks if Andy tried anything, saying that he knew this would happen and that if fame was really that important to her then he hopes she gets the job. He then leaves her sobbing his name on a rooftop.
Neil tries to get his equipment for the movie, but when he tries to find his producer, he is discovered to be gone, along with the $5,000.
Senior year.
Kevin has a meeting with Ms. Kraft, the dance teacher, because he asked her to write him a letter of recommendation. She says she can not write him the letter, because she believes he is not talented enough to become a professional dancer. Meanwhile, as they talk, Alice is dancing to ('Black and Gold') practicing her jazz piece. This conversation with Ms. Kraft causes him to attempt suicide by stepping in front of a subway car. Joy, Rosie, and Jenny are there to stop him.
Victor is told by his girlfriend, Alice, that she is going on a world tour next week. He asks if she will visit him, but she says that after P.A. couples usually go their separate ways.
Joy drops out of school before graduation because she is working on 'Sesame Street' full-time now and her grades have suffered.
Malik talks with Mr. Dowd about his father, which leads to Mr. Dowd telling him about breaking down his walls. Victor, Malik and Denise put on a hip-hop concert at a club at which her parents are at, but Denise told them it was classical jazz because of her father's wishes for her to pursue classical piano and not vocals. Despite this, she defies her father and goes on anyway and wins over her mother during the performance. Marco, along with Neil, Joy, and Rosie, is there to watch but when he sees Jenny come in, he says he has to go. Jenny stops him from leaving, saying that she's been thinking a lot about him, and that it kills her that she hurt him.
Later, during the concert, he puts his arms around her and they smile at each other. When Denise leaves with her parents, her father is outraged and tells her that he is pulling her out of P.A., even though she is about to graduate. Her mom stops him and says that if Denise wants to sing, she should sing.
Graduation.
Before graduation, Jenny gives a speech about success to the graduating class, saying that she felt it when she was in the school. Kevin tells Joy that he is moving back to Iowa, and that he is going to be "the best god damn dance teacher there ever was". During the graduation performance, everybody participates ('Hold Your Dream'), with Denise as the main singer. It ends with all the characters following graduating (except Joy and Alice).
Cast.
The main cast is featured on the official website.
Release.
Critical reception.
The film has received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 25% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 116 reviews with an average score of 4.4/10. For its general consensus, they conclude that ""Fame" is ultimately undone by its choppy editing, its incomplete characterizations, and its apparent desire to appeal to the High School Musical generation" Based on 26 critical reviews sampled by Metacritic, it gave an average score of 39% for the film. On "At the Movies", Michael Phillips gave the film a See It while A.O. Scott gave the film a Skip It.
Box office.
The film opened at No. 3 behind "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" and the newly released "Surrogates" with approximately $10,011,682.

Storm Lake Times

About.
The Storm Lake Times is a twice-weekly newspaper based in Storm Lake, Iowa covering Buena Vista County and parts of Clay, Pocahontas, Sac, Ida and Cherokee counties. The inaugural issue was published on Friday, June 29, 1990, with a full-time staff of just three persons in a 20-by-20 foot one-room office at 521 Michigan Street in Storm Lake, Iowa.
Within a year of opening, the weekly newspaper rapidly outgrew its original office and moved to larger quarters at 210 East Fifth Street, across from the Buena Vista County Courthouse. At that time the paper’s circulation had increased from an initial 1,800 to nearly 4,000 copies every Friday. Initially, The Times was printed at Buena Vista Stationery and Printing, but with the growing number of pages and the need for color photographs, printing operations were moved to Le Mars, Iowa.
In March 1993, The Times began publishing daily, a first in Storm Lake's 125-year history. Three weeks later the rival newspaper in town also went daily, and for 10 months Storm Lake attracted national attention as the smallest city in America with competing daily newspapers. Coinciding with The Times’ switch to daily publication was construction of a new office and printing plant at 220 West Railroad Street (Times Square), which could accommodate staff offices and a six-unit Harris offset printing press.
The Times switched to twice-weekly publication (Wednesday and Saturday) in January 1994. Several years later the rival newspaper gave up daily publishing as well. In November 2001 The Times switched from the familiar tabloid format to broadsheet because of increasing pressure within the newspaper industry to standardize page sizes. The move to a larger page was welcomed by readers and advertisers alike.
The Storm Lake Times was the first newspaper in Iowa to be composed entirely on computer (pagination). The Times was also one of the first newspapers in the state to have an imagesetter, an electronic film machine that allowed staff to produce the highest quality type and photographs, in both color and black and white. In 2004, The Times became the second newspaper in Iowa (after the Des Moines Register) to adopt computer-to-plate electronic imaging which improved printing quality even more.
-Oct. 20, 2007, The Times was mentioned by The New York Times and ABC's George Stephanopoulos and gained national attention for being the first newspaper to endorse a presidential candidate. Written by editor Art Cullen and entitled "Biden For President" the piece stated the case for then-Delaware senator and current Vice President Joe Biden to be elected.
-May 7, 2008, The Times again received national attention for a story written by reporter Jake Kurtz about Dale Davis, a blind, World War II veteran who bowled a perfect 300 game at Century Lanes in Alta, Iowa.
-Nov. 3, 2009, Times editor Art Cullen testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in Washington, D.C., on the impact of health care costs on small businesses in America. The appearance came at the request of a longtime friend, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa).
At a glance.
-The Storm Lake Times is the only locally-owned newspaper in Buena Vista County, and the only newspaper still printed within the county's borders. It also has the largest readership of any newspaper in Buena Vista County.
-The Times printing press produces more than 1.8 million copies of publications per year. In addition to the newspaper twice a week, The Times also prints the liberal Progressive Populist (twice monthly political publication), four Northwest Iowa school alumni publications, as well as various other printing jobs. Its platesetter also produces high resolution printing plates for other area printers. The Times press can print up to 12 broadsheet pages per section with color photos, at a speed of 15,000 copies per hour.
-An average issue of The Times includes 50+ news and sports photographs, about one-third of them in color.
-The Times sports department covers 8 high schools (Storm Lake, Storm Lake St. Mary's, Alta, Newell-Fonda, Schaller-Crestland, Sioux Central, Aurelia, Laurens-Marathon) and one college (Buena Vista University).
-Nearly 600 area cooks have been featured in the popular “My Favorite Recipes” weekly feature.

Fool's Paradise (The Head Cat album)

"Fool's Paradise" is a 2006 album recorded by The Head Cat, a collaboration between Lemmy of Motörhead, Slim Jim Phantom (of The Stray Cats), and Danny B. Harvey. It features covers of mostly classic 1950s songs.
While there is nothing groundbreaking in this recording, the 1950s songs that are chosen (penned by likes of Buddy Holly and members of his group) are played "commendably", keeping close to the original versions with restraint. The album received less praise from other critics.
Critical reception.
Greg Prato of Allmusic refers to the album as "a much needed antidote to the computer/software enhanced state of popular music" and "a worthwhile listen for die-hard fans to hear Lemmy tackle covers of some of his favorite standards". Bob Gottlieb wrote in "Folk & Acoustic Music Exchange" that the band "play some damn good music" and that the songs are "not filled with the fireball frenetic energy that can often make Rockabilly about as pleasant as the sound of a dentists drill nowadays". However, Paul Jordan Sr. wrote the album "sounds like karaoke from a biker's bar! Bad songs sung by bad voices".

Glendon and Rushton railway station

Glendon and Rushton railway station is a former railway station in Rushton, Northamptonshire. Originally known as Rushton it was opened in 1857 by the Midland Railway on what is now the Midland Main Line.
Plans had been made earlier in 1847 for a line from Leicester to , but had lapsed. However the Midland, running to Rugby at that time and dependent on the LNWR for its path into London, was looking for an alternative. It revived its plans for Bedford to go forward to Hitchin to join the Great Northern Railway
While initially solving the problem, traffic continued to build such that the line was quadrupled from London as far as Glendon Junction a little way to the south of the station. Here a new line had been opened through Corby and Manton which could be used by goods trains and those for Nottingham., Thus the line through Glendon northwards was double track as far as Leicester.
It was renamed in 1896, possibly when Rushden opened in 1894 on the Wellingborough to Higham Ferrers line.
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
It closed on 4 January 1960 but the building still stands on the south side of the line.
Until 2006, the station building was subject to a statutory tenancy, and the daughter of the last Station Master lived there. In 2009 a group was formed, named the "Friends of Glendon and Rushton station", to restore the station which was granted Grade II listed status in 1981.

Tales of a Third Grade Nothing

"Tales of a Third Grade Nothing" is the sixth episode of the seventh season of "Family Guy" that aired on November 16, 2008 and ended the first half of the season. The episode follows Peter (voiced by show creator Seth MacFarlane) as he goes back to finish the third grade so that he is able to get a promotion at work. It also follows Brian (also voiced by MacFarlane) and Frank Sinatra, Jr. (voiced by himself) as they buy a club and give it to Stewie (MacFarlane) so that he can remodel it. 
The episode was written by Alex Carter and directed by Jerry Langford, their firsts for the "Family Guy" series. Besides Sinatra, the episode featured guest performances by Bob Barker, James Burkholder, Max Burkholder, Chace Crawford, Elisha Cuthbert, Kaylee DeFer, Andy Dick, Carrie Fisher, Bruce Jenner, Phil LaMarr, Debbie Reynolds, Sinbad, Billy Unger and Mae Whitman, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. The episode garnered 8.52 million viewers, as well as mostly positive reviews from television critics.
Plot.
Peter is sent upstairs by his boss to deliver shipping reports to the CEO. On his way to deliver the reports, he decides to go into the executive bathroom. When he discovers how lavish the bathroom is, he becomes motivated to do well at work so that he can become an executive so he can use the executive bathroom. But while trying to impress his boss Angela by blowing up a billboard, he inadvertently blows up part of a children's hospital. Nevertheless, she is impressed by his improvement at work and recommends an open executive spot for him. However, Human Resources tells him he must first complete the third grade in order to qualify.
Peter does badly at school and offends his teacher Mrs. Wilson by telling a story about her (Mrs.Wilson was also Peter's teacher when he was a third grader), and makes fun of top student Omar. Mrs. Wilson allows Peter to attend the spelling bee after spelling out buttlickers which even Omar can't spell. Omar fails the spelling bee because he misspelled "coagulate", but Peter succeeds after correctly spelling the word "lesbians". When Peter goes back to work, Angela tells him that he will be going to jail for the hospital explosion instead of getting promoted. Fortunately for him, he receives only one week in prison and is told he will be released the following Sunday night at 9:00 ("Family Guy"'s usual time slot).
Meanwhile, Frank Sinatra, Jr. comes back to town to perform with Brian at the "Quahog Cabana Club". Since the club owner is looking to sell, Brian and Frank buy the establishment and they let Stewie transform it into a modern dancing Entertenment club called "Place" (Now Nopl). At first, Frank and Brian feel uncomfortable, but their feelings change once they get into the club life themselves. However, the club swiftly loses its popularity once Andy Dick is seen there. Once the club has emptied, Frank and Brian perform another song.
Production.
"Tales of a Third Grade Nothing" was written by newcomer Alex Carter. It was directed by former "Mission Hill" and "The Oblongs" director Jerry Langford, who had joined the show's directing staff that season making this his first "Family Guy" episode, he would direct the episode "Stew-Roids" later that season. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for "Tales of a Third Grade Nothing".
Actress Carrie Fisher, who is most famous for her role as Princess Leia in "Star Wars", returned to voice Peter's boss, Angela, which she started voicing in the fourth season episode "Jungle Love". Fisher has been given high praise for her portrayal of the character, with The Hollywood Reporter calling it one of her "5 Most Iconic Roles." Singer Frank Sinatra, Jr. also returned to voice himself like he did in another fourth season episode "Brian Sings and Swings". 
In addition to Fisher, Sinatra and the regular cast, former game show host Bob Barker, actor James Burkholder, actor Max Burkholder, actor Chace Crawford, actress Elisha Cuthbert, actress Kaylee DeFer, comedian Andy Dick, athlete Bruce Jenner, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actress Debbie Reynolds, actor Sinbad, child actor Billy Unger, and voice actress Mae Whitman guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actors Lori Alan, Alexandra Breckenridge, writer Steve Callaghan, Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, writer John Viener, and writer Wellesley Wild made minor appearances.
Cultural references.
"Tales of a Third Grade Nothing" makes several media references. The name of the episode itself is a reference to Judy Blume's children's book "Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing", whose narrator-protagonist is likewise named Peter. The first few minutes feature a parody of the film "Jurassic Park" where Peter enters the executive bathroom and inside there is a helicopter that takes Peter to an island; John Hammond, who is inside the helicopter, welcomes Peter, and the music playing while the helicopter flies above the island is that which was used in the movie. Peter using the restroom and commenting on how peaceful everything is is also a reference to a far different scene in the movie when a lawyer was eaten by a Tyrannosaurus Rex after attempting to hide in a bathroom stall. Yosemite Sam, one of the classic "Looney Tunes" characters, is seen trying on skinny jeans in Barney's. The Emperor from the Star Wars movies requests that the song "On the Dark Side" by John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band be played at Brian and Frank's club. A video of John Madden's wedding is shown. Stewie references singer Michael Jackson and how his dance styles appeared to be violent to his own genitalia. Peter says he feels sympathy for John Wilkes Booth then it cuts to Booth at the theater while being annoyed by an obnoxious Abraham Lincoln.
Reception.
In its original broadcast in the United States on November 16, 2008, "Tales of a Third Grade Nothing" was watched by 8.52 million homes and acquired a 4.2 Nielsen rating, the audience measurement systems developed to determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States.
The episode received positive reviews. Ahsan Haque of IGN praised "Tales of a Third Grade Nothing", writing that it had "a convoluted storyline that actually has some kind of logical flow, and more than a fair share of genuinely funny and outrageously offensive jokes.". He graded the episode 8.5 out of 10. Steve Heisler of "The A.V. Club" wrote that the episode was an above average episode, and graded it B. In contrast, Robin Pierson of "The TV Critic" gave the episode a negative review, saying that while it was funnier than the usual episodes of the show it was still "plotless ramblings".

Naval Air Station Chatham

Naval Air Station Chatham, was an operational United States Navy airfield from 1917 to 1922. It was first established as a blimp base during World War I. It was located in Chatham, Massachusetts.
The base was one of the first operational naval air stations in the country. It helped to patrol the northeast United States coast and even participated in a skirmish off of Orleans. In 1922, the station was closed and the history of the base has largely been forgotten except for a lone marker near where the site used to be.
History.
Plans.
As German U-Boats began to get more emboldened by their successes, it became apparent to many that the United States would soon enter a war. As a result, the Department of the Navy planned six new Naval Air Stations on the East Coast. One just happened to be locate next to Pleasant Bay, near Chatham, Massachusetts. The planned station occupied on Nickerson Neck.
Construction.
Before the United States even entered World War I, construction of Chatham Naval Air Station was beginning. The original plans called for building living quarters for officers and enlisted men, hangars, a gas holder, boat house, hospital, pigeon loft, repair shops, garage and assorted storage and maintenance buildings. Pipes were laid in trenches and the nearest fresh water source was away. One of the workers died when his trench caved in on him. His name was Patrick Buckley and he left three sons.
By October, the barracks and mess hall were ready for furniture and galley equipment. The resulting structures could handle about 100 men. That same month, the flag pole was placed and 3,000 people were in attendance for its first raising. In November, the United States entered the war. In December, the skeleton of the blimp hangar was finished and wooden slats were soon covering them. Concrete was then set to be poured for the hangar floors. This was complicated by the fact that it was one of the coldest winters that year. As a result, the concrete was poured and protected by tar paper and hot sand. The sliding doors were then installed at the end of that February. The base was commissioned on January 6, 1918.
Patrols.
By then, many buildings were ready for occupancy and by mid-March, four Curtiss R-9s were delivered to the Chatham Train Station. They were assembled and the first flight was made by Lt. McKitterick on March 25. In July, four Curtiss HS-1L flying boats were delivered to the depot and trucked to the base. These boats were so urgently needed that they were put into service almost immediately. The addition of these boats increased the time available to patrols from dawn to dusk. Two patrol areas, aptly named Areas A and B were then created. Area A was to the north while Area B was to the south. Planes always went in pairs with one plane carrying a radio transmitter. The plane with the transmitter was required to radio in a location every ten minutes. Both planes carried two homing pigeons for emergency communication with the base, and the birds had been trained for either the north patrol or the south patrol. Thus they could not be transferred from one area to another. Planes were equipped with emergency rations and water for three days, a flashlight, flare pistol with red and green cartridges, a sea anchor, life preservers, signal book and local charts. Patrols took place at with the purpose to protect the shipping in a defined area. Often the planes would circle around a ship for hours while looking for U-Boats after picking up the vessel in a predetermined location. While the two planes were out on patrol, two other planes and their fliers were on standby at the station, ready to assist should a plane radio in a distress call. If the planes and men could get airborne within seven minutes, they were considered to be within the acceptable range of response time. Eventually blimps were used to help in the patrol process. With their cruising speed of and a range of , they were a useful asset in the patrols.
U-boat attack.
One of the few known times when the station was utilized for the war was when a report came in of the shelling of nearby Nauset Beach. Nine Curtiss HS-2Ls were dispatched to bomb the submarine that had already sunk five ships and was proceeding to start shelling Orleans, Massachusetts. Either the resulting bombs were duds or they missed, and the U-boat got away.
Closure.
In 1922, the base was closed, possibly because of the aftermath of the 1918 flu pandemic. It is unknown when the buildings were torn down and the area was eventually redeveloped into a housing complex. In 1979, a stone memorial was placed at the end of Strong Island Road to commemorate the NC-4 flight. In the 1980s, two PBYs retraced the famous flight that passed by the station.

Fairfield University Men's Club Volleyball Team (FUMCVB) is a men's college volleyball club based at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut. The team competes in Division 1 West of the New England Collegiate Volleyball League (NECVL) after winning the NECVL Division 2 two straight years between 2006 and 2007.
Organization.
The team competes year-round in league matches and tournaments in the northeastern US as well as nationally. The club is organized and operated by player-elected officers that are chosen at the end of each season. The current officer positions are President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. The club is supported by dues paid by every club member and through funding provided by the University. The club annually attracts over 30 students at tryouts and maintains a roster of approximately 15 student athletes. Student-athletes are expected to attend practice 2-3 times per week, as well as attending conditioning sessions during the week. The season begins in late September and concludes at NIRSA Nationals in Mid-April.
History.
While the university recognized men's club volleyball in the mid 90's, the team was officially founded in 1998 and recognized as a member of the New England Club Volleyball League (NECVL) in 1999. While still relatively young, the team is one of the most accomplished sport clubs at Fairfield University.
The FUMCVB team concluded their 2008 season falling in the second round of the Silver Bracket of the NIRSA National Club Volleyball Tournament in Dallas, TX, good enough for a #17th ranking nationally in Division 2 (student body less than 10,000). They finished their league play with a 7-2 league record with victories over Columbia University, Dartmouth College, University of Connecticut, University of New Hampshire and Yale. They fell to Yale in the Quarterfinals of the 2008 NECVL League Championships held at Fairfield University. 
From 1999 - 2007 the team competed in the NECVL, gaining back-to-back Division 2 league championships in 2006 and 2007. The team went undefeated in league play in 2007, winning nearly 20 league matches without losing a single game. Between 2006 and 2007 the team only lost one league match, winning nearly 40 league matches in two years. 
The team has garnered two national Top 25 finishes at NIRSA Nationals, achieving that status in 2006 and 2008.

Omalaeti O'Swapo

Omalaeti O'Swapo was the only album released by the Namibian political kwaito group Omalaeti O'Swapo (meaning; Swapo juniors). The group included four musicians, Pablo, The Dogg, Gazza and Elvo but was actually the pet project of the Swapo party. The group was chosen and put together by the Swapo party. The four artists were one of the most popular musicians in the Namibian music industry at the time the group was formed. Elvo handled all the production duties, and John Walenga handled the management and promotion under the supervision of Swapo. The album sold well, especially among the Swapo veterans and supporters, but was not critically successful due to its political influence. After the release of the album each member went back to their respective solo careers, rarely speaking about Omalaeti O'Swapo. 
Album objectives.
The album's objective was to promote Namibian's 2004 presidential elections. President Hifikepunye Pohamba was the Swapo presidential candidate after former President Sam Nujoma stepped down. The Omalaeti O'Swapo musicians used the opportunity of their kwaito talent on the album to encourage the youth and the Namibian nation at large to take part in the election. 
Presidential Call.
""Presidential Call"" is the album's first track and is a remake of Gazza's song ""Shidolodolo"". The song features an encouraging speech from both presidents. 
Establishment of Omalaeti Music.
After the release and success of the album, John Walenga (the executive of the album) established a music company by the same name, Omalaeti Music. Omalaeti Music is today one of Namibia's biggest labels and is home to successful selling artists such as Tate But, PDK and DJ Kboz.

Carroll Community College

Carroll County Community College is a 2-year Community college serving the residents of Carroll County, Maryland.
History.
Responding to interest expressed by citizens of Carroll County, the Carroll County Board of Commissioners examined the need for additional educational opportunities in the county in 1973. As a result, the county commissioners appointed a team to conduct a special study to review the possibilities.
Catonsville Community College took an interest in the idea and presented a proposal, which was sent to a Carroll Community College Advisory Committee with the purpose of evaluating the recommendation for a community college. Then, a draft Community College Service Agreement was forwarded to Catonsville Community College. On February 10, 1976, the Carroll County Commissioners entered into a three-year contractual agreement with Catonsville Community College to establish a branch campus in Carroll County. The green light was given for the Carroll County branch of Catonsville Community College to begin its instructional program for more than 750 students with over 1500 course registrations.
As a result of a visit by the Maryland State Secretary of Higher Education, Dr. Shaila Aery, the college began to take steps towards becoming independent. In 1992, the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) directed the college to begin the process for it to achieve degree-granting status as a two-year community college.
In late 1992, the college met with the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), to become accredited as a two-year, degree-granting institution. After visits by evaluating teams representing MHEC and MSCHE, degree-granting status was offered by MHEC in 1993 and candidacy with MSCHE was awarded the same year.

Lordship of Anholt

The Lordship of Anholt was a small state of the Holy Roman Empire. It was an imperial estate and a member of the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle. 
Geography.
The state consisted only of the City of Anholt in the present-day District of Borken in the German state of North Rhine Westphalia. It had received town privileges in 1347 and finally was incorporated into the City of Isselburg in 1975. The Lordship bordered three larger states: the Duchy of Guelders, the Bishopric of Münster, and the Duchy of Cleves. 
History.
The Lords of Anholt, originally liegemen of the Utrecht bishops, reached independence as "Freiherren" by the early 14th century. In 1402, their territory fell to the Lords of Bronckhorst through marriage. These acquired a comital title and in 1431 had Anholt recognized by King Sigismund of Luxembourg as an imperial estate with a seat in the Reichstag. 
In 1512 the forces of Guelders under Duke Charles of Egmond occupied Anholt, as the Bronckhorst counts had sided with his rival Philip I of Castile, and could not be induced to release it until in 1537 they were paid a significant ransom. The counts stayed loyal to the House of Habsburg, therefore their lordship had to suffer in the Eighty Years' War, when it was attacked by the Geuzen of the Utrecht Union, as well as in the Thirty Years' War. 
In 1641, again by marriage, Anholt was acquired by the princes of Salm, and passed to the Salm-Salm division of Salm. When Salm-Salm was annexed by France in 1793, Anholt became the seat and main possession of the princes of Salm-Salm. In 1802, the princes of Salm-Salm, together with their relatives, the princes of Salm-Kyrburg, received the newly created Principality of Salm as a compensation for their losses from the Empire; this much larger new Principality was adjacent to Anholt and eventually incorporated it.

Association of Armenian Scouts

The Association of Armenian Scouts (Armenian: "Haï Ari", alternately "Association des Scouts Armeniens") was the Armenian Scouting in Exile movement recognized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement. In 1929 the Association of Armenian Scouts, centered in Paris, was given recognition as a member of the International Conference. "Haï Ari" (in French "Association des Scouts Armeniens", in English Association of Armenian Scouts) was a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement from 1928 to 1997. The organization was recognized in exile, with headquarters and approximately 1,100 members in France.
History.
Scouting in Armenia was founded in 1912, then later developed abroad among the refugees who had survived the genocide of 1915-1916 and among those that had fled the new communist occupation of their lands, at which point Scouting ceased to exist in Armenia.
Dr. Kourkène Medzadourian, Chief Scout of Armenia, moved to France, where troops of Armenian Scouts were established in large cities.
In 1929, World Scouting recognized the association of Armenian Scouts "Haï Ari", based in France. While the Association did not have its own territorial base, it was the exception to the rule, remaining a member of the World Organization and the European Scout Region.
In April 1939, J. S. Wilson paid a visit in Paris for the tenth anniversary of the recognition of the Association of Armenian Scouts.
At its meeting in 1945, the International Committee considered the standing of the two non-territorial National Scout Organizations, the Association des Scouts Armeniens and the Association Nationale des Scouts Russes. It was proved that the Armenian organization was very much alive, and that it had members in various countries, some of whom could not be recognized as Scouts without the existence of the Armenian organization. The same did not appear to be the case with the Russian Scouts, whose membership had dwindled and seemed to be confined to DP camps. The Committee felt that the continued registration of the Association Nationale des Scouts Russes was not justified. The policy adopted in 1947 and reaffirmed in 1949 remained as it was until 1957, when the Committee decided to reconsider the whole question of policy in view of changed conditions.
In 1994, Hayastani Azgayin Scautakan Sharjum Kazmakerputiun (HASK - the Armenian National Scout Movement) was born. The French-based Association of Armenian Scouts expressed its desire to withdraw from membership in order to allow Scouting in Armenia to become a member of the World Organization, and ceased to exist as a member of the World Organization. Membership in the World Organization passed to Hayastani Azgayin Scautakan Sharjum Kazmakerputiun on April 18, 1997.
The organization was disbanded on January 9, 1998.
Ideals.
The Scout Motto is "Միշտ պատրաստ", "Misht Badrast", "Always Ready" in Armenian.
The Scout emblem incorporated the national colors as well as Mount Ararat, also an element of the coat of arms of Armenia.

List of Central American submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film

The following is a list of the films submitted by the Central American countries in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Academy Awards.
As of 2010, only five Central American films have competed in this category. Nicaragua sent two films in the 1980s, Guatemala sent one film in the 1990s, and Costa Rica sent one film in the 2005 and another in 2010. All films were made in Spanish. In 1983, Nicaragua's Alsino and the Condor became the first and thus far only Central American film to be nominated for an Oscar. 
El Salvador, Honduras and Panama have never submitted films for consideration. 
<br>
NOTE: The year listed in the table is the year the film was submitted for Oscar consideration. The Oscar ceremony took place the following year.
All three early submissions were political dramas set against the backdrop of U.S. longstanding involvement in the region's political affairs. Nicaragua's first submission, "Alsino and the Condor", tells the story of an 11-year boy named Alsino whose remote village becomes the scene of fighting between visiting U.S. "advisers" and rebel fighters. Six years later, they sent "The Spectre of War", funded in part by the Nicaraguan government, about a resort worker who leaves his job to join anti-Contra forces. The film was most notable for interspersing dance choreography with war footage. 
Guatemala's sole Oscar entry, "The Silence of Neto" takes place in 1954, against the backdrop of a U.S.-supported coup d'état as seen through the eyes of an upper-middle-class young boy, witneessing the world changing around him. 
The most recent Central American entry is Costa Rica's "Caribe", an ecological soap opera featuring a love triangle between a married couple and the wife's newly arrived half sister. Like the earlier three, U.S. influence prominently features in the plot in the form of an international oil company which wants to begin oil drilling in the ecologically pristine area.

Raid on Saint-Paul

The Raid on Saint-Paul was an amphibious operation conducted by a combined British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Marines force against the fortified French port of Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte (now known as Réunion) during the Napoleonic Wars. The operation was launched on 20 September 1809 as both a precursor to a future full scale invasion of Île Bonaparte and in order to capture the French frigate "Caroline" and the East Indiamen she had seized in the Action of 31 May 1809 which were sheltering in the harbour. The operation was a complete success, with British storming parties capturing the batteries overlooking the port, which allowed a naval squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley to enter the bay and capture the shipping in the harbour.
The French defenders of the town, despite initially resisting the attack, were unable to prevent the seizure of the port's defensive fortifications. The British force later withdrew under pressure from the main garrison of the island, burning warehouses containing over £500,000 worth of silk captured from British merchant ships. Ultimately the French were unable to effectively oppose the invasion, the island's governor General Des Bruslys retreating to Saint-Denis rather than engage the British and later committing suicide. The transportation of forces from the recently captured island of Rodriguez, the co-ordination of land and naval forces and the failure of the French defenders to co-ordinate an effective response were all features of the subsequent invasion and capture of Île Bonaparte in July 1810.
Background.
The French Indian Ocean territories of Île de France and Île Bonaparte were heavily fortified island bases from which French frigates were able to launch raids against British trade routes across the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars. In late 1808, a squadron of four frigates departed France for the region under Commodore Jacques Hamelin with orders to prey on the convoys of East Indiamen that regularly crossed the Indian Ocean. During the late spring of 1809, these frigates dispersed into the Bay of Bengal, attacking British shipping and coastal harbours around the rim of the Eastern Indian Ocean. The Royal Navy was also preparing an operation in the region, a staggered campaign intended to blockade, isolate and subsequently capture both Île de France and Île Bonaparte, eliminating the final French territories and bases east of Africa.
To conduct the British operation, Admiral Albemarle Bertie at the Cape of Good Hope organised a squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley to blockade the islands, capture any French shipping that presented itself and begin preparations for the invasions. Rowley was equipped with the antiquated ship of the line HMS "Raisonnable" and a small squadron of frigates and smaller ships, later reinforced with a force of soldiers from Madras in British India, with which he seized the nearby island of Rodriguez to use as a raiding base.
On 14 August, one of Rowley's ships, the 18-gun sloop HMS "Otter", attacked a French brig at Rivière Noire District on Île de France. Although the attack was ultimately unsuccessful, "Otter"'s captain Nesbit Willoughby and his landing party were able to break into and out of the harbour without severe difficulties. This prompted Rowley to consider a larger scale operation against a more heavily fortified French position. Two months earlier, in the Action of 31 May 1809, the French frigate "Caroline" had captured two East Indiamen, the "Streatham" and "Europe" in the Bay of Bengal. The French captain, Jean-Baptiste-Henri Feretier, led his prizes back to the French-held islands, arriving off Île de France on 22 July. Feretier was prevented from attempting to reach Port Louis by Rowley's blockading squadron and instead put his ships into Saint-Paul on Île Bonaparte to unload his captured vessels and replenish his supplies.
Preparation.
Rowley became aware of Feretier's presence at Saint-Paul during the following month and determined to attack the port and recapture the valuable ships in the harbour. The operation was also to be a prelude to an eventual invasion attempt, giving the squadron experience of an amphibious landing operation. Conferring with Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating on Rodriguez, Rowley determined that Keating's men would land behind the gun batteries that defended the town and storm them. This would allow Rowley to bring his squadron directly into the harbour, capture the shipping anchored there and possibly seize the town as well. Rowley's planning was directly affected by a failed attack on Saint-Paul on 11 November 1806, when HMS "Sceptre" and HMS "Cornwallis" had attacked the harbour without infantry support. Their target was the frigate "Sémillante", but neither ship had been able to pass the heavy batteries that protected the port and the British ships were forced to withdraw.
On 16 September, the troops were prepared, and 368 British Army soldiers were embarked on the British frigate HMS "Nereide" under Captain Robert Corbett, Willoughby's "Otter" and the Honourable East India Company schooner "Wasp". This troop convoy was joined off Saint-Paul on 18 September by the rest of Rowley's squadron, the flagship "Raisonnable" and the frigates HMS "Sirius" under Captain Samuel Pym and HMS "Boadicea" under Captain John Hatley. These ships mustered an additional 236 seaman volunteers and Royal Marines who would join the assault. The entire invasion force was then embarked on "Nereide", as Corbett had experience with the Île Bonaparte coastline, with the assault designated for the early morning of 21 September.
Assault.
At 05:00 on 21 September 1809, "Nereide" entered the bay of Saint-Paul under the cover of darkness and successfully landed the British force, without any sign they had been sighted from the shore, at the Pointe des Galets. The Pointe des Galets was north of Saint-Paul, the distance allowing the force, divided into Keating's soldiers from Rodriguez and the naval force led by Nesbit Willoughby, to approach the heavy gun batteries that guarded the port unobserved. Storming the strongest batteries, Lambousière and la Centière, at 07:00, the British force surprised the garrisons, captured the fortifications and turned their cannon onto the shipping moored in the harbour, firing grape shot at the decks of the frigate "Caroline".
A detachment of the British landing force then separated from the main body and seized a third battery named la Neuf, routing a force of local militia that attempted to block their advance with artillery assistance from the British squadron in the bay. The militia had come down from their garrisons in the surrounding hills and been joined by 110 French soldiers who had disembarked from "Caroline", but the small French force was easily brushed aside by the British landing party. Keating and Willoughby then destroyed the guns in the first two captured batteries and stormed the remaining two fortifications, once again capturing them and using their own cannon to fire on the shipping in the harbour.
While the landing force drove off the defenders and captured the fortifications, the naval squadron entered the harbour and opened up an overwhelming fire on the outnumbered "Caroline". Shot was also fired at the captured East Indiamen, various other vessels in the harbour and any small batteries or shore positions that remained in French hands. Feretier and the other French naval officers, recognising that their position was hopeless, cut the anchor cables of their ships and allowed them to drift ashore, where they abandoned ship to escape capture. The British squadron then anchored in the harbour as their crews set about refloating the grounded French ships on the beach. In addition to "Caroline" and the East Indiamen, Rowley's squadron successfully captured a 14-gun privateer brig named "Grappler" and five or six smaller ships. With the harbour and fortifications in British hands, Keating and Willoughby entered the town of Saint-Paul without further combat.
Withdrawal.
On the night of 21 September, the landing party embarked on the British ships in the bay having destroyed all of the fortified positions that surrounded the harbour. During 22 September, French forces were seen gathering in the hills around the town, brought from outlying garrisons to join the main garrison from the capital Saint-Denis by the island's governor General Des Bruslys. Rowley and Keating anticipated that this force, which outnumbered their own, would recapture the town on 23 September and accordingly ordered Willoughby to land with his marines and sailors to burn French government property along the waterfront. The most obvious and significant target of Willoughby's force was a warehouse on the docks that was stocked with the captured silk from the East Indiamen captured by "Caroline". Willoughby ordered this building to be burned, destroying over £500,000 worth of captured textiles, (the equivalent of £ as of ). Other nearby warehouses were not destroyed as it was not possible to rapidly determine their ownership. Although the French force had reached the outskirts of the town, Willoughby was able to land and rembark his troops without a single shot being fired. On 22 September, Rowley received a petition from a body of slaves in the town who had escaped during the fighting and demanded arms with which to attack the French. They also offered to burn the town to the ground. Rowley, who sought to cultivate good relations with the populace with a view to capturing the island in the near future, refused their demands and had the slaves returned to their owners, where eight were executed for plotting rebellion. There was however a noted example of a slave displaying loyalty to his owner: The painter Jean-Joseph Patu de Rosemont had served in the militia forces with the journalist Nicole Robinet de La Serve and was captured when Keating's troops entered Saint-Paul. Taken aboard the British squadron, Rosemont's son Amédée applied to exchange himself for his father as a prisoner but was refused. Shortly before the squadron departed, Rosemont's personal slave Félix swam to the squadron to serve his owner in captivity. For his loyalty, Félix was manumitted when Rosemont was freed in 1810.
On 23 September, Rowley and Keating planned another landing under cover of the guns of the "Nereide" to drive off the French reinforcements. On landing, however, it was discovered that the French force had disappeared. Lacking support for a counterattack from the local landowners, who favoured a return to the monarchy, Des Bruslys was unwilling to order an assault which he deemed would have inevitably led to an unnecessary bloodbath. Instead, he ordered his forces to abandon Saint-Paul and retire to Saint-Denis during the night. Without support from his commanding officer, Captain St-Michel, commandant of Saint-Paul, agreed to surrender the town entirely, withdrawing his remaining forces under a flag of truce. The agreed truce lasted five days, during which the British force loaded their ships with French government provisions, equipment, military and naval stores and those cargoes from captured British ships that had not been burnt by Willoughby. The French made no effort to prevent this, Des Bruslys having committed suicide some days before, torn between his refusal to surrender the island to the British and his reluctance to order a bloody battle for what he regarded to be an "open island".
Rowley also seized the East Indiamen "Streatham" and "Europe" and restored their previous captains and crews, who had been released as part of the truce. A number of smaller merchant ships were captured and all were refitted for the journey to Britain, to be convoyed there by the newly captured "Caroline". This 40-gun frigate, only three years old and very large and powerfully built, was given to Corbett in recognition of his services in the operation and renamed HMS "Bourbonaise", reflecting the British name for Île Bonaparte, Île Bourbon. Willoughby was promoted to post captain and immediately took command of Corbett's former ship "Nereide". Late on 28 September, Rowley led his force to sea from Saint-Paul having burnt or seized all government shipping, stores and buildings in the town and surrounding areas.
Aftermath.
Casualties of the operation were not high on either side. British losses in the landing party amounted to 15 killed and 58 wounded, with an additional three missing. The naval squadron suffered no known casualties in the engagement, principally because they did not come under heavy fire. French losses have not been calculated, but apart from General Des Bruslys were probably a similar figure to the British. In contrast, the damage to the morale of the French defenders of Île Bonaparte was severe: the death of Des Bruslys and the failure to properly defend the town undermined their efforts to such a degree that the eventual invasion of the island in 1810 was carried out without significant fighting or loss. This invasion force was similar in size to the raiding party and was once again led by Rowley and Keating.
"Caroline" was a "tolerably fine frigate" and her capture was a blow to the French squadron based on Île de France under Hamelin. The recapture of the East Indiamen was also an important success, reducing the impact of French operations in the region during 1809. The raid also provided the British forces with vital experience in conducting amphibious landings staged from Rodriguez and gave an indication of the quality of French shore defences and defensive formations throughout the islands, which would have an important effect on future operations, especially the Invasion of Île Bonaparte in 1810.

Erland and the Carnival

Erland and the Carnival are a British folk rock band, formed in London, by multi-instrumentalist Simon Tong (formerly of The Verve, Blur and The Good, the Bad & the Queen), Orcadian folk guitarist and singer Gawain Erland Cooper and drummer/engineer David Nock (The Orb, The Cult, The Fireman). In 2010 they released their critically acclaimed eponymous debut album. 
Erland and the Carnival are best known for their contemporary arrangements of traditional Scottish and English folk songs, including "Tramps and Hawkers", "Was You Ever See" and "Love Is a Killing Thing", collected by Ralph Vaughan Williams. The band's debut album was recorded at Damon Albarn's Studio 13 and released in January 2010.
History.
Erland Cooper spent years studying Bert Jansch and Davey Graham, sourcing old British songs from the Vaughan Williams museum near where he lives and developing his writing skills. He was introduced to Simon Tong and David Nock by his friend Youth.
After Erland recorded the track "Coming Home" with Nock for Tong and Youth's Butterfly recordings compilation "What the Folk (Vol 2)"- the three began writing and playing together around London. Inspired by Daniel Johnston's "Hello How Are You?" (On which he re-recorded individual albums to meet demand because his tape machine was broken), Erland and the Carnival released a limited edition debut EP in September 2008, with each CD containing different recordings unique to each copy.
Carnival are named after the Jackson C. Frank song "My Name is Carnival" which the band have recorded a cover version of. The track "Everything Came Too Easy" was inspired by a speech by Charles Van Doren to the House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight, a United States Congress subcommittee, investigating a rigging scandal on the quiz show Twenty One. The track "The Derby Ram" is a modernisation of a folk standard about a giant fictional sheep, reworked to comment on the suicide of Shaun Dykes.

Yordan Hadzhikonstantinov-Dzhinot

He was born around 1818 in Köprülü, Ottoman empire (today in Republic of Macedonia). Yordan completed his basic education in a local church school at Veles and next he attended the high schools at Thesalonika and Samokov. In 1840 he started to teach as a private teacher, and in 1845 he was appointed a teacher in a municipal school at Veles. There Yordan involved in a conflict with the Greek clergy and he was forced to leave the town. In 1848 he settled in Üsküp (now Skopje), where he worked as a teacher in the Bulgarian school. There Yordan applied modern pedagogical methods in his practice. Meanwhile he published some patriotic articles in the Bulgarian newspaper "Tsarigradski vestnik". In January 1857 Yordan was dismissed from the service under the pressure of the Greek metropolitan bishop of Üsküp. The same year the local Turkish authorities had Yordan exiled from Üsküp, where he would not return. 
In 1861, when the Grand Vizier of the Empire visited Köprülü, Benedictus (local bishop) acaused Yordan Hadzhikonstantinov of spying and conspiracy with the Serbians and the Bulgarian leader Georgi Rakovski, whose prohibited in Turkey books and newspapers Yordan had kept in his private library. The Grand Vizier believed the allegations and had Yordan exiled in Aydın, (Asia Minor). On the way to Aydin Yourdan lost one of his eyes, couse he was called "The Genie" ("Джинот", "Dzhinot"). He returned from exile in 1863 and devoted all of his time to the education.
Yordan Hadzhikonstantinov-Dzhinot died in Köprülü on 22 August 1882.
Works.
Yordan Hadzhikonstantinov was in touch with The Society of the Serbian Letters (Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) in Belgrade and he published some of his discoveries on the pages of "Glasnik magazine" (an official tribune of the society). On 24 January 1854 Yordan send from Skopie a manuscript copy of а medieval Bulgarian record, called ""A naration about the restoration of the Bulgarian Patriarchate in 1235"", which was discovered at first by Dzhinot and was published in "Glasnik magazine" in 1855. Yordan Hadzhikonstantinov-Dzhinot found a manuscript of a Bulgarian medieval story ""An oration of Saint Cyryl, how he baptized the Bulgarian people""', called ""Solunska legenda"" (""A legend from Thesalonika""). It was published in "Glasnik magazine" in 1856.
Yordan Hadzhikonsatntinov was author of some patriotic articles in the Bulgarian "Tsarigradski Vestnik" (""Istanbul newspaper""), as "God" (published in 1851), "Bulgarian literature" (1852), "About the Church Slavonic language" (1852), "Veles" (1857), "Prilep" (1854) etc.
They contain information about the history and geography of the Macedonian region, and also some information about the history of the Bulgarian people, Bulgarian education and the Bulgarian Church in Macedonia. Being a real Bulgarian patriot, Yordan Hadzhikonstantinov-Dzhinot thought, that Bulgarians are descedants of the ancient Thracians and Illyrians. In his publications Yordan lost no occasion to declare his Bulgarian ethnic identity:""...I am Bulgarian, and I bewail our lost Bulgarians, who are in Lower Moesia, and it is our duty to lay down our life for our brothers, the dearest Bulgarians.""
Macedonian point of view.
According to the Macedonian view, now prevalent and official in the books in Republic of Macedonia, Yoardan Hadzhikonstantinov-Dzhinot had Macedonian identity and ""he dedicated four decades of his life to promoting education in the Macedonian language"", so he had an important role for Macedonian National Revival and for establishment of a Macedonian literary language. The Yordan's articles, where he pointed that he is Bulgarian, refute these Macedonian assertions.

James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley

James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley (8 January 1312/1313 — 1 April 1386) of Heighley Castle, Staffordshire, was an English peer.
Origins.
James Audley was the son and heir of Nicholas Audley, 1st Baron Audley (1289–1316) by his wife Joan FitzMartin (died Feb. 1320 / 1 Aug. 1322), daughter of William I FitzMartin (d.1324), feudal baron of Barnstaple, Devon. She was in her issue (i.e. posthumously) the eventual sole heiress of her brother William II FitzMartin (d.1326) to the feudal barony of Barnstaple.
Marriages and progeny.
James Audley married twice:
Succession.
James Audley had settled the feudal barony of Barnstaple by means of an entail on his heirs male, with remainder to the crown. As all his sons from both his marriages died without progeny, the barony thus became the inheritance of King Richard II (1377-1399), who granted the barony to his half-brother John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter (c.1352-1400), in tail-male.

Stand-off at the Fords of Arkaig

The Stand-off at the Ford of Arkaig occurred in September 1665 at Achnacarry, about northeast of Fort William, Scotland. The Chattan Confederation led by the Clan Mackintosh assembled an army to challenge Clan Cameron in a 360 year-old dispute over the lands around Loch Arkaig. After a week of stalemate, the long-running feud was ended by a deal in which the Camerons bought the land from the Mackintoshes.
Background.
14th century.
The Camerons and Mackintoshes had disputed the ownership of lands around Loch Arkaig and in Glen Loy to the south since the beginning of the 14th century. According to Mackintosh tradition, before 1291 the land had belonged to Dougal Dall MacGilleCattan, chief of the ancient Clan Chattan. In that year, his daughter Eva married Angus Mackintosh, 6th chief of Clan Mackintosh, uniting the two clans in the Chattan Confederation. Angus and Eva lived in Glen Loy for a few years before Angus had to flee from the Lord of Islay, into exile in Badenoch. The Camerons then occupied the lands, provoking about 360 years of feuding over the area. The clans fought their first battle, the Battle of Drumlui, in either 1330 or 1337. William Mackintosh, the son of Angus and Eva, had his right to the lands confirmed by charters from John of Islay, Lord of the Isles in 1337 and from King David II in February 1359. These charters and the marriage formed the basis of the Mackintosh claim on the lands, even though they were occupied by the Camerons for many years.
1660s.
Lachlan Mackintosh of Torcastle became chief of Clan Mackintosh in 1660, and immediately pursued his clan's ancient claim to the land. In 1661 he obtained a decree from Parliament assigning the lands to him, whilst Ewen Cameron of Lochiel was at Court pushing his claims to Ardnamurchan and the area around Loch Sunnart on the West Coast. In a letter dated 7 June 1661 the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, Lord Glencairn, wrote from London to the "Lord President and Lords of Session" in Edinburgh telling them to freeze Mackintosh's action until they heard again from the King, as he had a scheme to resolve the problem and reward Cameron for his loyalty (Glencairn and Cameron had played large parts in the Royalist rising of 1651 to 1654). No more was heard from the Court, so in July 1662 Mackintosh obtained a Decree of Removal against the Camerons in the area. Cameron sought an audience with the King, pointing out that the Camerons would not leave their ancient lands peacably. The King was unwilling to interfere directly in the affairs of Parliament, so a letter was written on his behalf to the Earl of Middleton, another veteran of the uprising and now Lord High Commissioner to the Scottish parliament. This letter, dated 30 May 1662, urged Middleton to find a peaceful resolution. Meanwhile a warrant had been issued for Cameron's arrest, but he persuaded the Privy Council to defer it for a few weeks, allowing him to return home to Lochaber.
Later that summer Mackintosh petitioned for a Commission of fire and sword against Cameron, unsuccessfully at first but in 1663 he had the whole of Clan Cameron declared outlaws. The commission against Cameron authorised various noblemen to implement it, but when approached by Mackintosh, they all told him to accept the financial compensation that had already been offered to him by Cameron. So Mackintosh decided to take matters into his own hands and having failed to induce his neighbours to join him, resorted to bribery to get them on his side. Meanwhile in January 1665, the Duke of Rothes, Lord Chancellor of Scotland, ordered the Commission of Fire and Sword into abeyance until the Privy Council had decided what to do.
Both Cameron and Mackintosh appeared before the Privy Council and agreed to be bound by its decision. Initially the Council told them to agree a sum of compensation between themselves, but when this proved impossible, the Council ordered Cameron to pay Mackintosh 72,000 merks (about £3600 in English money of the time). Mackintosh tried to leave Edinburgh in secret, but was arrested and bound to keep the peace. However as soon as he got home, he called on the Chattan Confederation to launch an expedition into Lochaber. Some of his friends tried to dissuade him, but Mackintosh ignored them and led 1500 men to the south end of Loch Lochy. Cameron assembled a force from his own clan joined by MacGregor men, a clan that had served Glencairn in 1653-4, and a small party of MacIans of Glencoe. They numbered 300 bowmen, plus 900 men armed with guns, broadswords and targe shields. They then marched for Cameron's home at Achnacarry, which is in a strategic position on the south bank of the River Arkaig, on the isthmus between Loch Arkaig and Loch Lochy.
Stand-off.
On 16 September 1665, Mackintosh marched through the wood of Glastermore to Clunes before taking up position in what is now known as Caig Parks north of the River Arkaig. Cameron's men withdrew across the river to Achnacarry, securing the only ford on the river. For two days the armies faced each other across the river. Having no boats, Mackintosh started to move his force up the side of Loch Arkaig, getting as far as Achnasaul. Cameron entrenched 50 men at the ford, and then moved the rest of his force west to face Mackintosh across the loch.
Meanwhile, the Earl of Argyll had sent 300 Campbells under John Campbell of Glen Orchy, later Earl of Breadalbane, with orders to end the dispute with force if necessary. He started negotiations with Mackintosh, who retreated east a little, setting camp opposite the island of Eilean Loch Airceig, but no agreement was found that day. On the 19th, a settlement was agreed by friends of the two parties, but Mackintosh refused to accept the terms, even when his men refused to fight for him. Mackintosh and his army marched back to Clunes. On the morning of the third day, he agreed to a deal in which he sold the land to the Camerons for 72,500 merks, and his friends paid the extra money he wanted themselves.
Meanwhile Campbell had encountered a party of men under Cameron of Erracht, whom Cameron had sent across the loch by boat the night before. Cameron had started on a march with the rest of his men to the western end of Loch Arkaig and back down the north bank, to surprise the Mackintosh army from the west. En route Cameron met Campbell, who told him of Mackintosh's agreement. Cameron wanted to continue his march until Campbell threatened to join his men with the Mackintosh army and set all the forces of the Earl of Argyll against the Camerons.
Aftermath.
On the 20 September 1665, Cameron crossed the river to meet with his former enemy at the House of Clunes and to sign a contract for the sale of Loch Arkaig and Glen Loy, with Cameron and six friends paying in three instalments over two years. Along with 24 of their leading clansmen, the two chiefs saluted each other, drank together, and exchanged swords to mark the end of the feud. That afternoon Mackintosh marched in good order north from Clunes to Laggan.
Tradition had it that in more than three centuries, "a Mackintosh and a Cameron had never even spoken together", which of course ignored alliances such as that at the Battle of Inverlochy (1431). The Camerons considered it something of a Pyrrhic victory, as the pursuit of their claim to Arkaig and Glen Loy over the years had cost them lands worth four times as much. Cameron had problems raising the money, and was offered a loan by the Earl of Atholl in an attempt to curb the power of Argyll, but Argyll offered a similar loan at lower interest. However there were strings attached, Cameron had to pay £100 Scots in feu-duty and to acknowledge Argyll as superior of the lands. The Camerons were still paying rent to Argyll's factor in 1749.

Maiacetus

Maiacetus ("mother whale") is a genus of early middle Eocene (ca. 47.5 mya) cetacean from Pakistan. 
Paleobiology.
The genus contains a single species Maiacetus inuus, first described in 2009 on the basis of two specimens, including a specimen which has been interpreted as a pregnant female and its fetus. This represents the first description of a fetal skeleton of an archaeocete. The position of the fetus (head-first) suggests that these whales gave birth on land. Whales generally give birth tail first, while all land mammals give birth head first. That the "Maiacetus" should give birth on land is not so implausible because this whale is semiaquatic or amphibious. "Maiacetus" represents the transition of land mammals back to the oceans where these animals were living on the land-sea interface and going back and forth.
However, J. G. M. Thewissen, discoverer of "Ambulocetus", has questioned these conclusions, suggesting that the smaller skeleton could be a partially digested meal. Even if the small skeleton is a fetus, Thewissen writes that it may not have been preserved in its normal in-vivo position.
This species is medium-sized with a skeleton in length and an estimated weight of .

Central Midland Railway

The Central Midland Railway , a division of Progressive Rail Incorporated of Lakeville, Minnesota, is a short line railroad in the U.S. state of Missouri, operating under lease of the former St. Louis Subdivision of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. CMR operates the eastern-most 60 miles of the 298-mile Rock Island line which used to stretch from St. Louis to Kansas City, Missouri. Today, CMR's operation of the line is performed under two separate leases from the Union Pacific Railroad and the Ameren Corporation, respectively, from Overland, Missouri - a suburb of St. Louis, to a location just west of Union, Missouri. CMR's first leased-segment is Union Pacific's "Lackland Subdivision" which extends from "Rock Island Junction" near the intersection of Page Avenue and I-170 in Overland to a location on the north-side of Creve Coeur Lake in Maryland Heights, Missouri, known as "Vigus." The second leased-segment is owned by Ameren and extends from Vigus to Pleasant Hill, Missouri, with active service terminating just west of Union.
History.
The Central Midland is made up of trackage from the former 18th and 19th subdivisions of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRIP). The line was opened in 1905, and cut across the northern Ozark Mountains from St. Louis to Kansas City, Missouri. The entire route was 298 miles long, and featured several large bridges, as well as four tunnels. 
On March 31, 1980, the Rock Island ceased all operations as a condition of its bankruptcy, and the line was passed into the hands of the Kansas City Terminal Railroad. Soon after, the line was sold as part of a package deal which included the Kansas City to Tucumcari, New Mexico, "Golden State Route" to the St. Louis Southwestern Railway (SSW). SSW originally had plans to rehabilitate the Rock Island across Missouri as a part of its purchase. However, due to years of deferred maintenance by its previous owner, bringing the line up to modern class 1 mainline standards was deemed uneconomical by the SSW. Instead, the company acquired trackage rights to operate its trains over Missouri Pacific Railroad's (now Union Pacific) parallel St. Louis to Kansas City mainline. 
SSW never ran a single through-train across Missouri since it acquired the line in 1980, and kept the far eastern segment between Overland, Missouri, to Owensville, Missouri open to local train service only. After the 1993 flood, reopening the line all the way to Kansas City was a possibility SSW briefly looked into, but was quickly decided against given the deteriorated condition of the line and its related infrastructure, combined with the fact that many of the original on-line customers had either closed, moved, or converted to semi-truck for deliveries. From 1993 to 1995, on-line traffic between Owensville and Union declined significantly, and by December 1995, SSW cut train service back further east to Union. SSW then quickly filed a request with the Interstate Commerce Commission (now the Surface Transportation Board) to abandon the route west of Union. However, a lawsuit filed by the "Save The Rock Island Committee" (or "STRICT") resulted in denial of the application, and the rails remained. 
In 1996, SSW, which was a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad, officially merged into the Union Pacific Railroad. The entire St. Louis to Kansas City line was now entirely owned and retained by the Union Pacific. To regulate the route's competitive impact on UP's parallel ex-Missouri Pacific St. Louis to Kansas City main line, UP retained ownership of the extreme east and west ends of the Rock Island; specifically, from "Rock Island Junction" in Overland, Missouri, to "Vigus" in St. Louis County on the east, and between Pleasant Hill and Kansas City on the west. UP then sold the remainder of the line to Ameren, which formed a subsidiary for its railroad known as the "Missouri Central." 
Today, Union Pacific leases the operation of its eastern segment, known as the "Lackland Subdivision" to the CMR from Overland to Vigus. From Vigus on west to Union, Ameren leases the operation of its Missouri Central subsidiary to CMR. Union receives rail service on an as-needed basis. From Union west to Pleasant Hill, the line is unused and generally in poor condition. A 50-mile segment between Pleasant Hill and Windsor, MO, is in the process of being officially abandoned by Ameren. Although currently inactive, Union Pacific retains the west end between Pleasant Hill and Kansas City for possible reactivation in the future, if traffic patterns ever warrant it.

Diamond type

Diamond type is a method of scientifically classifying diamonds by the level and type of their chemical impurities. Diamonds are separated into four types: Type Ia, Type Ib, Type IIa, and Type IIb. The impurities measured are at the atomic level within the crystal lattice of carbon atoms and so, unlike inclusions, require an infrared spectrometer to detect.
Different diamond types react differently to diamond enhancement techniques. Different types can coexist within a single stone; natural diamonds are often mixes of Type Ia and Ib, which can be determined by their infrared absorption spectrum.
Not restricted to type are "green" diamonds, whose color is derived from exposure to varying quantities of ionizing radiation.

Juca

Júlio Cernadas Pereira (13 January 1929 – 11 October 2007), aka Juca, was a Portuguese football midfielder and coach.
Most of his career was associated with Sporting, as both player and manager.
Playing career.
The son of Portuguese parents who had settled in Mozambique, Juca was born in Lourenço Marques, and started playing professionally with local Sporting de Lourenço Marques, as a goalkeeper. In 1949 he returned to the land of his ancestors and joined Sporting Clube de Portugal, where he would remain nine years until his retirement at the age of only 29 – due to a knee injury– helping the "Lions" win five national championships and the 1954 domestic cup.
During nearly four years, Juca gained six caps for Portugal. His first game was a 1–1 draw with Austria on 23 November 1952 in a friendly match in Porto, and his last appearance was in another exhibition game, with Hungary (9 June 1956 in Lisbon, same result).
Coaching career.
Shortly after retiring, in 1960, Juca started managing, his first job being with main club Sporting's under-19. He was promoted to head coach of the first team the following year, being in charge for three 1/2 of the following five years, and winning the 1962 and 1966 leagues (he was only in charge for four matches in the latter campaign however) and the 1963 Portuguese Cup.
After spending the following years with three clubs, namely Académica de Coimbra – he was also inactive in some seasons – Juca returned to Sporting for the 1975–76 season, being fired after the team could only rank in fifth position, 12 points behind champions S.L. Benfica.
In his second spell with the Coimbra outfit, Juca accumulated and worked for the first time as coach of the Portuguese national team – in 1968 he had already worked in Brazilian Otto Glória's staff- winning three games during the 1978 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign and finishing second to Poland in its group, but faring worse in the 1982 edition (fourth position); both campaigns ended in failure to reach the final stages.
Juca was again in charge of the national side for the 1990 World Cup qualification, missing it by just two points in the favour of Czechoslovakia. After being dismissed, he returned to Sporting Clube de Portugal, working until 2004 as director of football and youth coordinator. He died at the age of 78.

Lego Games

Lego Games is a product range of the construction toy Lego, which focuses on a series of playable games of different types, all of which use Lego bricks, and use the Lego concept of building to encourage players to change adapt the rules of the games.
Set Information.
The Lego Games sets are board games created by designer Cephas Howard, with consultants Bernie DeKoven and Reiner Knizia, that incorporate Lego pieces as components for the game. Most use original themes and settings, though a small number have been based on existing Lego themes, such as Harry Potter Hogwarts which is based on the Lego Harry Potter theme, and Ninjago: The Board Game, based on Ninjago. The Ramses characters represent a mini-theme within the Games line, comprising three of the sets so far: Ramses Pyramid, Orient Bazaar, and Ramses Return. A more promoted subtheme is the Role-playing game based Heroica, with boards that can be connected to one another. All of the sets make use of the distinctive "Lego Dice" - a solid plastic, Lego-compatible cube with soft rubber rimming on each edge to give the die a particularly strong bounce. Depending on the game, the die can be built with different Lego tiles on its faces which will affect gameplay in different ways. The age recommendations range from five and up to eight and up.
The first Lego Games sets were released on July 2, 2009 in the United Kingdom. These ten sets varied in size from around 100 to 350 pieces. Four of the sets - Lava Dragon, Pirate Code, Minotarus, and Creationary - were later released in the United States in March 2010. In March 2010 four new sets were released in the United Kingdom, ranging in size from around 90 pieces to 120. In the United States five of the original ten games were released in June 2010, with only Lunar Command not getting released. This delay between European and American releases has repeated with each subsequent wave of new games. As part of a promotion for the American release, a tour of 13 different parts of the United States was undertaken from July 2 to September 19, 2010.
In July 2010 another four new sets were released in the United Kingdom. At around the same time, Shave a Sheep and Harry Potter Hogwarts were released in the United States, with the former game being renamed "Wild Wool," with Magma Monster and Orient Bazaar following in August and Atlantis Treasure in October. Christmas 2010 saw the distribution of the special set 2010: Happy Holidays - The Christmas Game, a gift to LEGO staff and partners. A further five sets are scheduled for general UK release in early 2011.

Anecdotal value

In communication studies, science communication, psycholinguistics and choice theory, anecdotal value refers to the primarily social and political value of an anecdote or anecdotal evidence in promoting understanding of a social, cultural, or economic phenomenon. While anecdotal evidence is typically unscientific, in the last several decades the "evaluation" of anecdotes has received sustained academic scrutiny from economists and scholars such as Felix Salmon S. G. Checkland (on David Ricardo), Steven Novella, R. Charleton, Hollis Robbins, Kwamena Kwansah-Aidoo, and others. These academics seek to quantify the value of the use of anecdotes, e.g. in promoting public awareness of a disease. More recently, economists studying choice models have begun assessing anecdotal value in the context of framing; Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky suggest that choice models may be contingent on stories or anecdotes that frame or influence choice. As an example, consider Joseph Stalin's apocryphal quote: The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.

Kathleen Coburn

Kathleen Hazel Coburn, OC, FRSC (September 7 1905 – September 23 1991) was a Canadian academic and a leading authority on the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
Born in Stayner, Ontario, a fourth generation Canadian of Scottish–Irish descent, Coburn was one of six children born to John Coburn, a Methodist minister, and Susannah Wesley Emerson, Coburn was educated at Harbord Collegiate Institute in Toronto, Canada and later studied at the University of Toronto, taking a BA in 1928 and an MA in 1930. Having been awarded an Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire War Memorial Scholarship (IODE) to Oxford in 1930, she obtained a B.Litt from St Hugh's College, Oxford in 1932. 
In 1930 the 25 year-old Coburn visited The Chanter's House at Ottery St Mary in Devon, which had been the home of the Coleridge family for centuries. Here she discovered an extensive archive of documents written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Geoffrey Coleridge, 3rd Baron Coleridge gave her unlimited access to this archive, and allowed her to have it photographed and the copies placed in the British Museum for the benefit of future scholars. He also granted her permission to edit and publish Coleridge's Notebooks, which she edited from 1957 to 1990. 
In 1949 Coburn was instrumental in negotiating the sale of this Chanter's House archive to the British Museum for £10,200, with a donation from the Pilgrim Trust. The collection was eventually deposited with the British Museum in May 1951. 
Coburn spent her entire academic career at Victoria College in the University of Toronto, firstly for four years as Assistant to the Dean of Women before joining the English Department in 1936, becoming Professor in 1953 until her retirement in 1971.

In 1979 she was awarded the Pierre Chauveau Medal by the Royal Society of Canada and the Rosemary Crawshay Prize in 1990.
Coburn made a bequest to Victoria College to set up 'Coburn Fellowships' where up to three Fellowships a year valued at $20,000 are awarded to Canadian and Israeli students who are studying in the fields of Fine Art or Humanities. The E. J. Pratt Library in the Victoria University in the University of Toronto has the Kathleen Coburn Reading Room, which is dedicated to Coburn's memory.

Barton Family Foundation

The Barton Family Foundation is a charity established in 2005 by United States Congressman Joe Barton to provide support to "select charitable organizations" in , which Barton represents. His daughter-in-law, Amy Barton, is the Foundation's Executive Director. The foundation spent $130,000 on overhead between 2005 and 2008 and made $90,000 in donations.
The foundation drew page one attention from the "New York Times" when it was revealed that major energy corporations, such as the Chicago-based nuclear energy producer, Exelon Corporation, make large gifts to the Foundation. In June 2008, at a time when Barton had introduced legislation to assist corporations with the recycling of spent nuclear fuel, Barton solicited a $25,000 donation to the Foundation from Exelon. Exelon has also donated $80,000 to Barton's campaign funds.
According to a 2008 "New York Times" story, the foundation pledged $400,000 to the local Boys and Girls Club to help build a $1.2 million clubhouse. The "Washington Times" reported in 2009 that the foundation gave only $90,000 for the clubhouse. The foundation also pledged $500,000 for a local Meals on Wheels group. Although the foundation made no direct gifts to that charity, Energy Future Holdings and BNSF Railway gave $35,000 in the foundation's name. Both companies have also supported Barton election campaigns. 
The donations by major energy corporations led to an investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics in 2009. Barton was cleared of unethical conduct charges.

Gap Puche Cabin

The Gap Puche Cabin is a log cabin near Jackson, Wyoming that is the last survivor of the early outfitting industry in Jackson Hole. It was built "circa" 1929 at the junction of the Gros Ventre River and Crystal Creek by brothers-in-law Actor Nelson and Charlie Smith. Beginning in 1930 the property was used by John Wort and Steve Callaghan as a base camp for their hunting guide, or outfitting operation, and became known as "Wort's Hunting Camp". Callaghan's interest in the operation was bought by Billy Stilson around 1935, and bought out Wort by 1939. The cabin was moved in 1942 or 1943 to its present location.
In 1976 Stilson sold the outfitting business to Gap and Peg Puche, who continue to use the cabin as a base camp.

Fredrik Gabriel Hedberg

Fredrik Gabriel Hedberg (July 15, 1811 in Saloinen, now a part of Raahe - August 19, 1893 Kimito) was Finnish Lutheran priest, Neo-Lutheran writer and father of confessional Lutheranism in Finland.
Hedberg was ordained 1834 and became curate in Siuntio, then in Lohja, belonging since 1836 to Pietist revivalist movement led by Savonian farmer and lay preacher Paavo Ruotsalainen. Soon Hedberg became one of the leaders of this movement in southern Finland. Rationalist diocesan chapter begun to dislike Hedberg's activity because of his Pietism and he was transferred first to Paimio 1838 and 1840 as prison chaplain in Oulu. 1842 he became temporary curate in distant Raippaluoto and 1843 curate in Pöytyä.
Gradually, since time in Oulu, Hedberg discovered Lutheranism without any "order of salvation" from Martin Luther's postil and abandoned Pietism including books of Arndt and Spener among others, which had formerly been his spiritual authorities. He began to read Luther, Praetorius, and Book of Concord, and wrote in Raippaluoto a devotional commentary to 1st chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, "The Doctrine of Faith unto Salvation" (Eng. transl. 1998), which focused on justification by faith alone, being full of joy about salvation. Hedberg now began a controversy against Pietism, using works of Johann Gerhard, Rudelbach, Löhe, G. Thomasius, Harless and Catenhusen. His main writing in this controversy is "Pietism och Christendom" (1845) where he criticised Spener, Rambach, Fresenius, Nohrborg and Schartau. 1855 Hedberg became parish priest of Kaarina, publishing a book against the teaching of the Baptists. 1862 he became parish priest of Kimito.
Hedberg published several religious newspapers for his readers. He kept reading neo-Lutheran theology, Luther and evangelical Roman Catholics Martin Boos and Johannes Gossner. He organised a fundraising as a gift for persecuted Old Lutherans of Prussia. Also in Sweden he had lots of readers associated with Rosenius. His theological influence had become so remarkable, that the Lutheran Evangelical Association of Finland was founded in 1873 to foster and maintain confessional Lutheran revival in Finland.
Later years Hedberg focused more and more on sacraments and on mystical union with Christ. In St Andrew's church in Kimito the Eucharist was celebrated every Sunday during Hedberg's time, which was at that time very rare. As celebrant he also always used chasuble.

Jean-Pierre-Antoine Rey

Jean-Pierre-Antoine Rey (21 December 1767 - 12 January 1842) commanded a famous French infantry regiment during the Napoleonic Wars and became a general officer in 1808. He led an infantry brigade in a number of actions in Spain. His brother Louis Emmanuel Rey was a French general of brigade who also served in Spain during the Peninsular War. Since most sources do not distinguish between the generals named Rey, the two are easily confused.
Early career.
Rey was born on 21 December 1767. He became colonel of the 57th Line Infantry Regiment on 11 November 1803. In the War of the Third Coalition the 57th fought at the Battles of Memmingen, Ulm, and Austerlitz. At Austerlitz on 2 December 1805, the regiment fought in Dominique Vandamme's division of Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps. On 25 December 1805, Rey received the Commandant's Cross of the Légion d'Honneur.
Peninsular War 1808–1809.
The Dos de Mayo Uprising in May 1808 rendered the French occupation of Spain insecure. Among other units sent to Spain to reinforce the Imperial French units already there were ten veteran battalions under Georges Mouton. Dropping off one brigade at Vitoria, Mouton joined the army of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières and fought at the Battle of Medina de Rioseco on 14 July 1808. Hilaire Benoît Reynaud's brigade with 3,000 men of the 4th Light and 15th Line Infantry Regiments participated in the battle. The troops left at Vitoria were commanded by Rey, a newly minted brigadier. The brigade consisted of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 2nd Light and 12th Line Infantry Regiments and one battalion of the "Garde de Paris".
On 9 November 1808, Marshal Nicolas Soult replaced Bessières in command of the II Corps with Mouton's troops designated the 1st Division. The next day, Soult crushed an outclassed Spanish army at the Battle of Burgos. Seeing the Spanish deployed in a bad position, the French marshal placed Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud's dragoon division on the left, Antoine Lasalle's light cavalry in the center, and Mouton's infantry on the right. Not bothering to wait for divisions under Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle and Jean Pierre François Bonet to arrive, Soult ordered an attack. After a cavalry charge collapsed the Spanish right wing, Lasalle's horsemen swung to take the left wing in flank while Mouton's foot soldiers mounted a frontal attack. In the subsequent slaughter, French losses were probably less than 200 while the Spanish may have lost 2,500 killed and wounded and another 900 captured. The same regiments fought under Merle at the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809, but Rey was no longer with the division by that time. The brigadiers were Reynaud, Jacques Thomas Sarrut, and Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières.
At the Battle of Talavera on 28 July 1809, Rey led a brigade in the IV Corps division of Horace François Sébastiani. Sébastiani arranged his brigades side by side in two lines. Therefore, the six battalions of Rey's 28th Line Infantry Regiment and Louis Ligier-Bellair's 58th Line were in the front line. Their initial attack was launched against the British 61st Foot and the Guards Brigade. Ignoring the French musketry, the red coats waited until their enemies were away before firing a murderous volley. The front ranks of French soldiers were mowed down and the survivors took to their heels with the British infantry in enthusiastic pursuit. The 61st Foot soon halted, but the British Guards chased their enemies too far. The routed French battalions rallied behind the second line and, with the help of their powerful artillery, defeated and threw back the Guards. A second French attack rolled forward, threatening to burst through the mauled enemy formations. The British commander Arthur Wellesley quickly brought up Alexander Randoll Mackenzie's brigade and there was a deadly musketry duel for twenty minutes before the second French attack was beaten back. Losses were appalling on both sides. Sebastiani's division suffered 2,100 casualties, of whom only 60 were made prisoners. The butcher's bill included all four colonels wounded, seven of 12 battalion commanders, and 70 other officers. On the British side, Mackenzie was killed and his brigade lost 632 casualties out of roughly 2,000. The Guards lost 611 out of 2,000. The 61st Foot lost 265 men. The second line units in Sébastiani's division were the 32nd and 75th Line Infantry Regiments.
Peninsular War 1810–1814.
Spanish General Joaquín Blake y Joyes Blake advanced from the Murcian border on 2 November 1810 with 8,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. Cúllar was reached on the 3rd and the small Spanish army kept going. Blake committed a serious blunder by allowing his troops to become badly spread out. His advance guard of cavalry and 3,000 infantry bivouacked near Baza on the evening of the 3rd. His 2,000-man rear guard camped near Cúllar while his remaining division was situated between the two towns. Defending Baza was Rey with a brigade from Sebastiani's 1st Division. Rey's force counted one battalion of the 32nd Line Infantry Regiment and three battalions of the 58th Line.
But help was on the way. Receiving news of the Spanish invasion, Édouard Milhaud marched his cavalry to Baza. He reaching there early on 4 November 1810 and united his horsemen with Rey's 2,000 French infantry. Milhaud brought 1,300 cavalrymen, including the 5th, 12th, 16th, 20th, and 21st Dragoon Regiments and the Polish lancers of the Legion of the Vistula. The French also had two horse artillery batteries. Blake had 12 guns in addition to the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the Army of the Center. Arranging his troopers on both sides of the main highway, Milhaud ordered a cavalry charge. The French horsemen plowed into Blake's horsemen and scattered them. As the Spanish cavalry fled, they rode through their own infantry formations. When the French dragoons and Polish lancers galloped toward the disordered Spanish infantry, the men took to their heels. The Imperial French horsemen completely smashed Blake's vanguard, hacking down scores of soldiers and capturing hundreds of others. When the French came upon Blake's second division deployed in difficult terrain, they stopped their charge. Blake quickly ordered a retreat. In the Battle of Baza the French lost 200 killed and wounded. The cavalry won the battle and Rey's infantry suffered negligible losses. Blake's army lost 500 killed and wounded and 1,000 soldiers captured.
In February 1812, Francisco Ballesteros with 2,000 Spanish infantry and 300 cavalry attempted to seize the port of Málaga. On the 16th the Spanish force bumped into Jean-Pierre Maransin with 2,000 French infantry and 400 cavalry at the village of Cártama. Ballesteros claimed to have killed Maransin and cut down 1,200 of his men. In fact, Maransin was wounded and his troops suffered about 150 casualties. The Spanish force retreated when Rey appeared with 2,500 foot and 200 horse and aimed an attack at Ballesteros' flank.

Napoleon Diamond Necklace

The Napoleon Diamond Necklace is a diamond necklace commissioned by Napoleon I of France c. 1811–1812. It is currently on display in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., United States.
Description.
The Napoleon Diamond Necklace consists of 28 mine cut diamonds set into a single thread, with a fringe of alternating pendeloque and briolettes diamond cuts. The five pear-shaped pendoloques are each mounted below a small brilliant cut diamond. The four ovaline pendeloques are mounted above designs which incorporate 23 brilliant cut diamonds each. Each briolette mounting is set with 12 rose cut diamonds.
While the gems of the Napoleon Diamond Necklace have never been professionally graded by a lapidary (as they have never been removed from their mountings), infrared spectroscopic analysis of the diamonds has shown that they are primarily Type Ia. However, 13 of the 52 largest diamonds in the necklace are of the rare Type IIa variety. A number of the Type Ia diamonds show indications of sulfide crystal imperfections.
History.
Marie Louise.
In 1810, Napoleon I of France divorced the Empress Joséphine, as she proved to be incapable of producing an heir. He re-married two months later to Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria. Within a year, Marie Louise bore a son. To celebrate, in June 1811 Napoleon I commissioned the Napoleon Diamond Necklace from the Parisian jewellery firm Nitot et Fils, at a cost of 376,274 French francs. This sum was the equivalent of the Empress's entire annual household budget. There are several contemporary portraits of Marie Louise wearing the Napoleon Diamond Necklace, including a number by the artists François Gérard and Giovan Battista Borghesi. Several years later, in 1815, Napoleon was exiled to Saint Helena. Marie Louise returned to Austria with the necklace and owned it until her death.
Inheritance and sales.
Upon the death of Marie Louise in 1847, the necklace passed to Archduchess Sophie of Austria, the wife of her nephew Archduke Franz Karl of Austria. Two diamonds were removed from the necklace to shorten it, at the request of Princess Sophie. These diamonds were fitted to a pair of earrings, the location of which is now unknown. Following the death of Sophie in 1872, the Napoleon Diamond Necklace was jointly inherited by her three surviving sons, Archdukes Karl Ludwig, Ludwig Viktor, and Franz Joseph of Austria. Karl Ludwig later acquired his brothers' stakes in the necklace, and upon his death in 1914 passed it to his third wife, Maria Theresa of Portugal.
At the start of the Great Depression in 1929, Maria Theresa engaged two people presenting themselves as "Colonel Townsend" and "Princess Baronti" to sell the necklace for US$450,000. Realising that the current economic conditions would make it almost impossible to reach the asking price, the pair began offers at $100,000, signing on Archduke Leopold of Habsburg, the destitute grandnephew of Maria Theresa, to vouch for the necklace's authenticity. Deals were negotiated with the jewelers Harry Winston and Harry Berenson, but eventually the pair sold the necklace to David Michel of New York for $60,000, of which the pair claimed $53,730 as expenses. When informed of the sale, Maria Theresa took the matter to court, eventually resulting in the recovery of the necklace, the jailing of Archduke Leopold, and the flight of Townsend and Baronti from the authorities.
After resolving the incident, Maria Theresa held the necklace until her death in 1944. Four years later, the Habsburg family sold it to the French industrialist Paul-Louis Weiller. In 1960, Weiller sold the Napoleon Diamond Necklace to Harry Winston, who believed that the historical value of the piece would make it more valuable than if the stones were removed and resold individually, as was common practice at the time. As such, he kept it intact, reselling it the same year to Marjorie Merriweather Post. Post donated the necklace to the Smithsonian Institution in 1962, and it has since remained on display at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., United States.

Louis Martin (lay brother)

Blessed Louis Martin (22 August 1823 – 29 July 1894) was a French layman and the father of Saint Thérèse de Lisieux. His wife was Blessed Marie-Azélie Guérin.
Life.
Early life.
Louis Joseph Aloys Stanislaus Martin was the third of five children of Pierre-François Martin and Marie-Anne-Fanie Boureau. All his siblings died before reaching age 30.
Although Louis intended to become a monk, wishing to enter the Augustinian Monastery of the Great St Bernard, he was rejected because he did not know Latin. Later he decided to become a watchmaker, and studied his craft in Rennes and in Strasbourg.
Marriage and family.
He later fell in love with Marie-Azélie Guérin, a lacemaker, in 1858 and they married just three months later. Her business was so successful that Louis sold his watchmaking business to go into partnership with her.
"Alongside this strong, tender, but undeniably domineering woman Louis Martin seems to have been made of much softer stuff. He was a dreamer and brooder, an idealist and romantic. He loved nature with a deep sentimental enthusiasm. From him Thérèse inherited her passion for flowers and meadows, for her native landscape, for clouds, thunderstorms , the sea and the stars. There was too..wanderlust...He made pilgrimages to Chartres and Lourdes, went to Germany and Austria, travelled twice to Rome and even to Constantinople, and planned but did not live to carry out a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. " Along with this desire for adventure was an impulse towards withdrawal; in Lisieux he arranged a little den for himself high up in the attic, a true monastic cell for praying, reading and meditation. Even his daughters were allowed to enter it only if they wished spiritual converse and self-examination. As in a monastery, he divided the day into worship, garden work and relaxation.
Although the couple lived as brother and sister for ten months after their wedding, they decided to have children. They would later have nine children, though only five daughters would survive infancy:
As a jeweller and watchmaker he loved the precious things with which he dealt. To his daughters he gave touching and naïve pet names : Marie was his "diamond", Pauline his "noble pearl", Céline "the bold one", and "the guardian angel" - Thérèse was his "little queen", "petite reine", to whom all treasures belonged.
On August 28, 1877, Zélie died from breast cancer in Alençon, Orne. Louis sold her lacemaking business and moved to Lisieux, in Normandy, where Zélie's brother Isidore Guérin, a pharmacist, lived with his wife and two daughters.
Death.
In 1889 Louis suffered two paralyzing strokes followed by cerebral arteriosclerosis, and was hospitalised for three years at the Bon Sauveur asylum in Caen. In 1892 he returned to Lisieux, where his daughters Céline and Léonie looked after him devotedly until his death on July 29, 1894 at the chateau La Musse near Évreux.
Beatification.
Louis and Marie-Azélie Martin were declared "venerable" on 26 March 1994 by Pope John Paul II. They were beatified on 19 October 2008; Jose Cardinal Saraiva Martins, the legate of Pope Benedict XVI, presided at the Mass of Beatification in the Basilique de Sainte-Thérèse, Lisieux. The faithful are now invited to pray for a miracle attributed to their joint and sole intercession. After such a miracle is deemed credible by officials at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, they can be counted among the saints of God.
Progress toward canonization.
The cause of Blessed Louis and Zélie Martin has progressed significantly since 2008. On January 7, 2013, Archbishop Carlos Osoro Serra of Valencia, Spain presided at the opening of the canonical process to inquire into the healing in 2008 of a little girl named Carmen who was born in Valencia four days before Louis and Zelie were beatified. Eight doctors testified that there was no scientific explanation for her cure. The diocesan tribunal held its closing session on May 21, 2013, and the file was sent to Rome for review by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, who may recommend to the Pope that Louis and Zélie Martin be canonized.
Publications.
In 2011 the letters of Blessed Zélie and Louis Martin were published in English as A Call to a Deeper Love: The Family Correspondence of the Parents of Saint Therese of the Child Jesus, 1863-1885 translated by Ann Connors Hess and edited by Dr. Frances Renda (Staten Island, N.Y.: Alba House). Only 16 letters from Louis survive, but many of Zélie's 216 letters give vivid details about Louis as husband and father.

Large-cell lung carcinoma

Large-cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) is a heterogeneous group of undifferentiated malignant neoplasms originating from transformed epithelial cells in the lung.
Incidence.
[[File:Pie chart of lung cancers.svg|thumb|260px|Pie chart showing incidence of large-cell lung cancer (shown in green at upper left) as compared to other lung cancer types, with fractions of smokers versus non-smokers shown for each type.]]
In most series, LCLC's comprise between 5% and 10% of all lung cancers.
According to the Nurses' Health Study, the risk of large cell lung carcinoma increases with a previous history of tobacco smoking, with a previous smoking duration of 30 to 40 years giving a relative risk of approximately 2.3 compared to never-smokers, and a duration of more than 40 years giving a relative risk of approximately 3.6.
Another study concluded that cigarette smoking is the predominant cause of large cell lung cancer. It estimated that the odds ratio associated with smoking two or more packs/day for current smokers is 37.0 in men and 72.9 in women.
Diagnosis.
LCLC is, in effect, a "diagnosis of exclusion", in that the tumor cells lack light microscopic characteristics that would classify the neoplasm as a small-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or other more specific histologic type of lung cancer.
LCLC is differentiated from small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) primarily by the larger size of the anaplastic cells, a higher cytoplasmic-to-nuclear size ratio, and a lack of "salt-and-pepper" chromatin.
Classification.
The newest revisions of the World Health Organization (WHO) "Histological Typing of Lung Cancer schema" include several variants of LCLC, including:
Large-Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC).
One clinically significant subtype is "large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma" (LCNEC), which is believed to derive from neuroendocrine cells.
In addition, a "subvariant", called "combined large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma" (or c-LCNEC), is recognized under the new system. To be designated a c-LCNEC, the tumor must contain at least 10% LCNEC cells, in combination with at least 10% of other forms of NSCLC.
Clinically.
Patients typically present with a non-productive cough and weight loss.

Sainsbury's Local

Sainsbury’s Convenience Stores Ltd (trading as Sainsbury’s Local) is a chain of 500 convenience stores operated by the UK's second largest supermarket chain Sainsbury's. Sainsbury's Local stores have different branding and fascia to the company's supermarkets.
History.
In 1998, Sainsbury’s piloted its first Local store in Hammersmith. The store opened on the busy Fulham Palace Road, and was designed for the convenience of customers who did not have time to do a full food shop. Research showed that people were working longer hours and more women were in employment than ever before. Customers needed to spend less time on chores such as shopping, so local ‘top-up’ shopping was an ideal solution. As well as a large range of ready meals, wines and desserts designed for people on-the-go, the branch also offered hot drinks and freshly baked goods, alongside Sainsbury’s best selling products. The Hammersmith store also had a cash machine and opened until midnight most days of the week. 
The Sainsbury’s Local store was also ground-breaking in terms of staff training. In most Sainsbury’s stores, colleagues were trained for specific departments. The small size of Sainsbury’s Local stores meant that staff needed a high level of product knowledge across all departments. Keeping in line with the ‘Local’ concept, the Hammersmith store also employed only local people.
Joint venture with Shell.
In June 2003, Sainsbury’s announced that it was creating 100 new convenience stores at Shell petrol stations. The shops were to open over the next three years, leading to the creation of up to 2000 jobs. 
The first of the stores opened in the autumn of that year, following a successful trial at six garages in south east England. The new stores were based on the existing "Sainsbury Local" outlets, but also sold car care products and motor accessories. 
In the end, only 24 stores were opened. The joint venture has now ended due to being unprofitable.
Acquisitions.
Following rival Tesco’s purchase of the convenience store chain T&S Stores in 2002 and the subsequent conversion of 450 of the 870 T&S stores into its Tesco Express convenience stores, Sainsbury’s announced the acquisition of a number of convenience store chains:
Bells Stores.
In February 2004, Sainsbury’s announced it was to buy Bells Stores in the North East of England for around £22m. Bells Stores operated 54 neighbourhood stores, and was owned and run by the Bell family. The stores were initially refurbished to trade as ‘Sainsbury’s at Bells’.
Jacksons Stores.
In August 2004 Sainsbury’s further increased its presence in the convenience store sector, by acquiring Jacksons Stores for £78m from the family food business William Jackson & Son Ltd, owned by the Oughtred family. Jacksons Stores had 114 stores in the Yorkshire area and the North Midlands, and just before the Sainsbury’s acquisition, was voted the UK’s best independent convenience store chain. The acquisition doubled Sainsbury’s market share in the convenience store sector to 2%. The stores were initially refurbished to trade as ‘Sainsbury’s at Jacksons’.
J B Beaumont.
In November 2004, Sainsbury’s acquired JB Beaumont, a convenience chain owned and run by the Beaumont family and which was then number 48 in the Grocer Top 50. The company first began trading as a butcher in Kirkby-in-Ashfield (Nottinghamshire) in 1902. The six JB Beaumont stores were located in Cotgrave; Bingham; Keyworth; Long Eaton; Chilwell and Gedling. The stores were initially refurbished to trade as ‘Sainsbury’s at Beaumonts’.
S L Shaw.
In April 2005, Sainsbury’s acquired SL Shaw Ltd, a neighbourhood convenience store operator with five stores in the south east of England. After a programme of refurbishment, the five stores converted to the Sainsbury’s Local format, combining Shaw’s reputation and customer service with Sainsbury’s expertise in fresh and convenience foods.
Branding.
Sainsbury's initially retained the strong Bells and Jacksons brands. For example, refurbished stores were called Sainsbury's at Bells or Sainsbury's at Jacksons. These were effectively Sainsbury's Local stores with a revised fascia, retaining some features of the former local chain. Unrefurbished stores retained the original brand and logo, but still offered Sainsbury's own brand products, pricing and some point of sale, without accepting Nectar cards. The old websites were also retained with some Sainsbury's branding.
This was an experimental format and on 4 May 2007 it was announced that all stores would be re branded as Sainsbury's Local, with the management teams of the smaller stores integrated into Sainsbury's own teams.
Sainsbury's Central.
A second convenience format, Sainsbury's Central, was used for small to mid-sized stores in town centres and commuter areas; the Central stores have an offer dominated by food-to-go and convenience foods, but also carry selected ranges from mainline stores. Sainsbury's has announced plans to phase out Central as a store brand, and rename these sites simply as Sainsbury's, though some stores are still to be refurbished and converted.
Plans.
On 12 November 2008 Sainsbury's announced that 50 convenience stores would open in the 2009/10 financial year, and a further 100 the following year.

Nanfan Treaty

Deed from the Five Nations to the King, of their Beaver Hunting Ground, more commonly known as the Nanfan Treaty, was an agreement made between the representatives of the Iroquois Confederacy with John Nanfan, the acting colonial governor of New York, on behalf of the The Crown. The treaty was conducted in Albany, New York, on July 19, 1701, and amended by both parties on September 14, 1726. 
The Five Nations (which became the 'Six Nations' after 1720) granted "after mature deliberation out of a deep sense of the many Royal favours extended to us by the present great Monarch of England King William the Third" the title to a vast area of land, covering significant portions of the present-day Midwestern United States and southern Ontario that they had claimed as a hunting ground, as far west as 'Quadoge' (now Chicago), by right of conquest during the later Beaver Wars of the 17th century.
As the vast majority of the Beaver Hunting Grounds described in the Nanfan Treaty were also claimed by New France or its Algonquian Indian allies, the French did not recognize the treaty, and the English made no real attempt to settle these parts for the time being. In the amended agreement 25 years later, the strip of land 60 miles wide adjoining Lakes Erie and Ontario, starting at Sandusky Creek, was reserved for continued Six Nations occupation and use, with the permission of its owner under the 1701 agreement, the King of Great Britain. 
A copy of the treaty, containing the totem images of more than a dozen Iroquois chiefs, is part of the collections of the British National Archives.

Liu Zhennian

Liu Zhennian () (1898 in Nangong, Hebei, China - May 13, 1935) was a Chinese military commander during the Warlord Era and Nanjing decade in the history of the Republic of China.
Liu graduated from the Baoding Military Academy and served as a regimental and brigade commander under the warlords Li Jinglin, Zhu Yupu, and Zhang Zongchang. After the defeat of Zhang Zongchang, Liu switched sides his forces were absorbed by the Kuomintang. He captured and killed his former patron Zhu Yupu on 4 September 1929. Subsequently Liu was appointed commander of the 21st Division in 1930.
Having eastern Shandong as his defense area, he became known as the "King of Shandong East" and was unpopular for levying heavy taxes. In autumn 1932, he was attacked and evicted from Shandong by its governor Han Fuju because Liu had refused to obey his orders. After his defeat, Nanjing transferred him and his 21st Division south to Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province at the end of 1932. There his troops, removed from their familiar surroundings, suffered from sickness and became mutinous. Despite his appeal to Chiang Kaishek in January 1933, his Division was sent to participate in the Fourth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet in Jiangxi Province. He soon resigned from the army, but was arrested in May by Li Duping for disobeying Chiang's order to attack the Chinese Red Army and was executed as a consequence in 1935.

<doc id="19846590" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19846590" title="Operation Sea Signal">
Operation Sea Signal

Operation Sea Signal was a United States Military humanitarian operation in the Caribbean in response to an influx of Cuban and Haitian migrants attempting to gain asylum in the United States. As a result, the migrants became refugees at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The operation took place from August 1994 to February 1996 under Joint Task Force 160. The task force processed over 50,000 refugees as part of the operation. The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy rescued refugees from the sea and other migrants attempted to cross the landmine field that then separated the U.S. and Cuban military areas. Soldiers and Marines provided refugee camp security at Guantanamo Bay, and ship security on board the Coast Guard Cutters. This mass exodus led to the U.S. Immigration implementation of the Wet Feet Dry Feet Policy. The mass Cuban exodus of 1994 was similar to the Mariel boat lift in 1980.
Background.
As Economic, Political, and Social problems continued in Cuba many citizens were looking to the United States for better opportunities. These problems led to several demonstration across Cuba in early 1994. In response to anti-government demonstrations in Havana on August 5, 1994, Fidel Castro threatened to allow a mass exodus to the United States. A few days later Castro ordered his security forces not to interfere with anyone trying to leave. Almost immediately a wave of boat people known as Balseros, set out in home made rafts, boats, and inter-tubes to try to reach the United States. These devices were hastily made, overcrowded, and lacked enough food and water for the trip. The United States Military set out to help save the lives of the Balseros, and provide safety and security for them at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay. Upon finding the Balseros they were rescued and boarded unto U.S. Navy, and U.S. Coast Guard vessels. Many of the boat people were already suffering from heat injuries, and many had no food or fresh water. Several young boys and girls under the age of 10 were found floating alone on inter-tubes. The children talked of how their mother or father were taken by Sharks during the voyage. Several refugees died during the journey and numerous rafts were found completely empty or broken into several pieces. Many of the boats who had engines were out of fuel and were floating in the current.
Operations.
Preparations began quickly to accommodate the large influx of migrants to the base at Guantanamo. Military dependents were sent back to the United States not only for security, but also to help alleviate the water shortages that would plague the base during the course of the Operation. Large tent cities were constructed by military personnel at several sites across the Windward side of the base, including Camp Alpha, Camp Bravo. Camp Golf, and Camp X-Ray. The Base golf course and the McCalla airfield on the windward side were also reutilized as refugee holding camps. First established for Operation Sea Signal, notably Camp X-Ray, were reopened after the September 11 terrorist attacks to form the basis of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. 
Camp conditions were challenging due to high heat conditions, water shortages, lack of restroom facilities, and large amounts of trash. The camps were secured using rows of razor wire and were surrounded by portable light generators. Refugees lived in GP Large and GP Medium tents, and slept on military issue cots. Portable restrooms were located throughout the camp, and Navy Seabees constructed concrete shower facilities within the camps. Camp security included interior camp patrols, exterior camp patrols, and fixed exterior guard towers. 
Refugees were assigned to specific camps for several different reasons. Cuban and Haitian camps were separated from each other. There were specific camps for intact families, camps for single men, and separate camps for unaccompanied minors. There were not enough unaccompanied single women to fill and entire camp, but the camps often had tents that were set aside for only them. There was also a camp located at Camp X-Ray for refugees who committed various crimes while at Guantanamo Bay. Originally there was a combined camp for all single Men and Women, however due to several problems that arose from these combined living conditions the two groups were separated.
Camp living conditions improved on a daily basis throughout the operation. All day long you could view camp soccer matches, with many different teams within each camp. In the beginning of the mission U.S. Humanitarian rations were distributed as the main meals, and then military style chow halls were added to the camps. Artwork was constantly being created by the refugees, and the art work was displayed for the refugees, and the U.S. military to view. Several of the drawings and painting depicted the refugees travels across the Ocean, with several depictions of shark attacks.
All refugees were interviewed and screened by U.S. Immigration personal deployed to the base for operations. Haitian refugees were repatriated and returned to their country under a joint agreement between Haiti and the United States. Following an agreement between the U.S. and Cuban governments exodus was once again prevented by Cuba. The Cuban refugees were allowed entry into the United States, and the camps were removed and the base returned to normal conditions.

Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage.
These operations by the United States Joint Task Force 160 (September 8, 1994 – March 15, 1995) to relieve the overcrowded migrant camps at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.
Safe Haven established four camps on Empire Range, Panama to provide a safe haven for up to ten thousand Cuban migrants. Safe Passage then returned the migrants to Guantanamo after the crowded conditions could be alleviated. Camps were established in Panama as a result of an agreement between the US and Panamanian governments that permitted the Cubans to remain in Panama for six months. Cuban migrants continued to arrive until the camps reached their peak occupancy of 8,600. Of these 8,600, approximately 1,280 Cubans entered the United States in mid-October 1994 as a result of a program of parole entry by the US Department of Justice. In addition, 110 Cubans were accepted by Spain, and 10 by Venezuela.
Due in part to uncertainly about their future, some of the Cuban migrants became increasingly restless as the weeks went by. The growing tension led to disturbances and riots on December 7–8, 1994, which were quickly controlled by US military members. During the riots, more than 200 US military personnel and 30 Cubans were injured and two Cuban migrants drowned in the Panama Canal while attempting to flee from the camps. There was also considerable property damage, including the destruction of various military vehicles, computers, and telephones.
As the expiration of the US-Panamanian agreement permitting the Cubans to stay in Panama approached, planning began for Operation Safe Passage—the return of the Cubans to Guantanamo Bay Naval Facility. Between February 1, 1995, and February 20, 1995, several hundred Cubans were transported from Panama to Guantanamo Naval Base. The mission of the transfer operation was to move the Cuban migrants from Safe Haven camps in Panama to Guantanamo in a safe, orderly manner.
Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
Citation to accompany the award of the Joint Meritorious Unit Award to the Joint Task Force 160 (23 June 1995) General John Shalikashvili, USA, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff
The Joint Task Force 160, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, distinguished itself by exceptionally meritorious achievement from 20 May 1994 to 19 May 1995. During this period, the soldiers, sailors, marines, airman, and coast guardsmen of the Joint Task Force 160 provided emergency temporary humanitarian assistance to both Cuban and Haitian migrants under extraordinary circumstances that involved international interest. The Joint Task Force interdicted on the high seas, transported and off loaded over 50,000 Caribbean migrants from Coast Guard and Navy vessels, and provided shelter, security, nourishment, and medical attention. It also coordinated multi-agency operations at various centers throughout the Caribbean to identify, process, and transport Cuban and Haitian migrants to the United States safe haven locations, and back to Haiti or Cuba. With empathy and dedication to duty the Joint Task Force professionally aided large numbers of migrants during periods of extreme tension, while simultaneously serving US immigration interests and furthering US national policy. These difficult and complex tasks were accomplished in a superior fashion over many months despite political and legal controversy, limited logistical support, overwhelming numbers of migrants and the extraordinary nature of this non-doctrinal mission. By their exemplary performance of duty, the members of Joint Task Force 160 have brought great credit upon themselves and the Department of Defense.

The Estonian Air Force had more than 130 aircraft in the middle of the 1930s. Estonian engineers had previously designed and constructed several trainer and light fighter aircraft types, of which the most famous is the PTO-4 which entered service in 1938 as a military training aircraft.
Before the Soviet occupation, Estonia had placed an order for 12 Supermarine Spitfire fighters and 2 Westland Lysander aircraft from Britain, and was also seeking to purchase 12 Messerschmitt 109 fighters from Germany. Deliveries were interrupted by the start of World War II and the Spitfires later served in the Royal Air Force.

Nick Veasey

Nick Veasey is a British photographer working primarily with images created from X-ray imaging. Some of his works are partial photomanipulations with Photoshop. He therefore works with digital artists to realise his creations.
Born in London in 1962, he worked in the advertising and design industries and pursued work in conventional still photography before being asked to X-ray a cola can for a television show. Veasey also X-rayed the shoes he was wearing on the day and upon showing the finished image to an art director was galvanised by the response it provoked.
He lives near Maidstone, England. His work has featured in many international advertising campaigns and adorned products and packaging worldwide, notably Adobe's Creative Suite livery and Lenor/Downy fabric conditioner.
In 2009, a major exhibition of his works began at Maddox Fine Arts in Mayfair, London. Artworks are also exhibited in galleries internationally, with exhibitions running in 2010 in Europe, North America and Asia.
Veasey's first collection of images collated into hardback format: "X-ray: See Through The World Around You" was recently released by Carlton/Goodman in the UK and Penguin in North America. The book collects images captured over a 13-year period of experimentation with X-ray imaging and equipment.
He is the recipient of many photographic and design awards including IPA Lucie Awards, AOP, Graphis, Communication Arts, Applied Arts, PX3 and awards from the D&AD also being nominated for the IPA Lucie International Photographer of the Year 2008.
He claims to be responsible for realising the possibly largest X-ray to date, a life size Boeing 777 jet, which currently resides upon a hangar at Logan Airport, Boston.

Dwight Armstrong

Dwight Alan Armstrong (August 29, 1951 – June 20, 2010) was an American anti-Vietnam War activist who was one of four persons involved in the August 24, 1970, Sterling Hall bombing on the campus University of Wisconsin–Madison, in an act of political protest against the University's research efforts on behalf of the United States armed forces. The bomb destroyed the building, killing one person and injuring three. Armstrong spent several years on the run after the incident.
Armstrong was born on August 29, 1951, in Madison, Wisconsin. He grew up there as "an ordinary Midwestern boy, fond of playing baseball and bicycling around his exurban community" as described by "The New York Times" in his obituary. He dropped out of high school in 10th grade and by 1970 he had joined his brother Karl in actively opposing American involvement in the war in Vietnam. On New Year's Eve 1969, Dwight and Karl stole a light plane from a local airport and unsuccessfully dropped bombs on an area ordnance factory.
In response to the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970, in which four protesters were shot and killed by the Ohio National Guard, they conceived of an attack on the Army Mathematics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, which had been a frequent site of anti-War protests. Karl made a bomb out of dynamite, of fuel oil and of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
The bomb was placed in a stolen van left next to Sterling Hall, a building that housed the Army Mathematics Research Center, as well as the university's physics department. They lit the fuse after checking the windows of Sterling Hall and seeing no activity, assuming that the building was empty. A bomb threat was phoned in to the Madison Police Department, giving five minutes notice of the planned detonation, though previous such calls turned out to be pranks. A police cruiser was dispatched to the site minutes before the explosion. The bomb detonated at 3:42 AM on August 24, 1970, killing Robert Fassnacht, a physics post-doctoral researcher who was working late, injuring three others, and causing millions of dollars in damage to the building.
Dwight Armstrong drove away with his brother, Leo F. Burt, and David Fine to a truck stop where they celebrated the bombing. When they heard a news report on their car radio that someone had been killed by the explosion, all four went on the run, with Dwight's seven years at large the longest of the four people suspected in the bombing aside from Leo Burt, who is still at large. On September 4, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began a search for the four fugitives, placing them on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Armstrong remained underground until he was arrested in April 1977 in Toronto. He pleaded no contest to state murder charges and federal conspiracy charges. As part of his plea bargain he was sentenced concurrently to seven years each in state and federal prison and was released on parole in 1980 on the condition that he participate in a community rehabilitation program.
He was arrested again in 1987 in Indiana where he was charged with operating a meth lab. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was released in 1991. He came back to Madison, where he tended to his mother and worked driving a taxi. In 2001, he purchased the Radical Rye Deli with Karl.
In a 1992 interview with "The Capital Times" of Madison, he stated that "My life has not been something to write home about". He justified the bombing, stating that "We did what we had to do; we did what we felt a lot of other people should have done", continuing that "I don't care what public opinion is; we did what was right."
Armstrong died of lung cancer at age 58 on June 20, 2010, at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics in Madison, Wisconsin. He was survived by his mother, his brother, two sisters, and a daughter.

David Fine

David Sylvan Fine (born March 19, 1952) was one of four perpetrators of the August 24, 1970, Sterling Hall bombing on the campus University of Wisconsin–Madison, in an act of political protest to the University's research efforts on behalf of the United States armed forces. The bomb destroyed the building, killing one person and injuring three. Fine spent six years on the run after the incident.
Early life and education.
Fine was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the second of two children in middle-class family. He attended the Wilmington Friends School, a private Quaker-run school. He enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison beginning in the fall of 1969. At the university, he was reporter for the student newspaper, The Daily Cardinal, and earned above-average grades in his freshman year—the only year he was in attendance.
Sterling Hall bombing.
In response to the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970, in which four protesters were shot and killed by the Ohio National Guard, Fine, along with brothers Karleton and Dwight Armstrong and Leo Burt conceived of an attack on the Army Mathematics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, which had been a frequent site of anti-War protests. At age 18, Fine was the youngest of the four. Karleton made a bomb out of dynamite, of fuel oil and of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
The bomb was placed in a stolen van left next to Sterling Hall, a building that housed the Army Mathematics Research Center, as well as the university's physics department. They lit the fuse after checking the windows of Sterling Hall and seeing no activity, assuming that the building was empty. The bomb detonated at 3:42 AM on August 24, 1970, killing Robert Fassnacht, a physics post-doctoral researcher who was working late, injuring three others, and causing millions of dollars in damage to the building. Fine and the other three then drove to a truck stop where they celebrated the bombing. When they heard a news report on their car radio that someone had been killed by the explosion, all four went on the run.
Life as fugitive, capture, trial and imprisonment.
Fine was eventually captured in San Rafael, California on January 7, 1976. On June 8, 1976 he pled guilty to two felonies in federal district court: conspiracy and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. On the same day, he also pled guilty in Dane County Wisconsin Circuit Court to charges of destruction of property and to murder in the third degree for causing the death of Robert Fassnacht.
He was sentenced to a total of seven years in prison on the federal charges and received a sentence in the state court of seven years; the two sentences were to run concurrently. Fine was paroled on August 15, 1979 and remained on parole for approximately three additional years.
Later life.
After his release, he earned a college degree at the University of Delaware and a law degree at the University of Oregon. In 1987, after passing the Oregon Bar exam, Fine was denied admission to the Bar on the grounds that "he had failed to show good moral character." Fine appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Oregon which upheld the decision. In the court's decision it was written: He has not shown himself to be a credible person and did not establish that he now has the good moral character required to practice law. We base our decision on applicant's present statements about his past acts. We recognize that persons can and do reform. However, in this case applicant's deceitful, self-serving conduct persisted at the time of the hearing.
As of August 2010, Fine is married and works as a paralegal in Portland, Oregon.

Arise (horse)

Arise (foaled 1946 at Hamburg Place in Kentucky) was a Canadian Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racehorse. He was sired by the 1936 Santa Anita Derby winner, He Did, a son of the 1928 Preakness Stakes winner, Victorian. Out of the dam Coralie B., his damsire Apprehension was a grandson of English Triple Crown champion, Rock Sand.
Arise was purchased by Harry Addison, Sr. and Mrs. Jack Addison of Toronto, Ontario from breeder R. M. Wood in 1946. They entrusted the colt's race conditioning to future Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame trainer, Jim Bentley. In 1948 the two-year-old Arise was sent south to race in New York State where he won twice and was notably second in the Youthful Stakes, a race that at the time was one of the most important of the year for juveniles. As a three-year-old in 1949, Arise earned wins in important both Canada and the United States. At Toronto's Thorncliffe Park Raceway he set a track record for six furlongs and at Long Branch Racetrack he won the Canadian Championship Stakes. Racing in the United States, at New York's Saratoga Race Course Arise captured the Travers Stakes, marking the first-ever win in that prestigious race by a Canadian-owned horse. In the Jerome Handicap, he finished second by a nose to Capot. At age four, Arise continue to perform with the best. At Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York he won the Excelsior Handicap and the Fall Highweight Handicap plus the American Legion Handicap at Saratoga Race Course.
Sent back to the track at age six, Arise won the 1951 Monmouth Handicap, the Questionnaire Handicap and defeated Piet in winning the Carter Handicap.
Retired from racing, in 1953 Arise was sent to stand at stud at Kentucky's renowned Claiborne Farm. His time as a stallion was limited as he produced only a few offspring in 1954 and 1955, non of which met with racing success.

Benjamin Pierce Cheney, Jr.

Benjamin Pierce Cheney, Jr. (April 8, 1866 – June 5, 1942), was an American business executive. He had extensive investments in railroad securities and served as a director of Wells Fargo & Company and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. 
Cheney was born in Boston in 1866, the eldest child and only son of Benjamin Pierce Cheney and Elizabeth Stickney (Clapp) Cheney. His father was one of the pioneer expressmen of the United States. The younger Cheney prepared for college at English High School in Boston and with a private tutor. He received his BA degree from Harvard University in 1890.
Until the death of his father in 1895 Cheney aided him in the management of his interests, which included the largest portfolio of railroad securities held in the Boston area. Upon his father's death, he was elected to succeed him as a director of Wells Fargo & Company.
Having extensively studied railroad operations, Cheney was elected a director of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad and took an active part in the management of the Santa Fe system.
Besides his directorships with Wells Fargo and the Santa Fe system, Cheney was a director of Manchester Mills, Manchester, Massachusetts, and of numerous Boston banks and trust companies. He also served as president of the San Diego Land & Town Company, one of his father's old ventures. At one time he was a member of the Algonquin, Union, Boston Amateur Athletic and University clubs of Boston, the Metropolitan, Players and Harvard clubs of New York City, and the University Club of San Diego California.
He was married at Covington, Kentucky, on February 23, 1898, to Julia Arthur (born Ida Lewis), a noted actress. She was born at Hamilton, Ontario, on May 3, 1868, the daughter of Thomas J. Lewis, a tobacco manufacturer, and Elizabeth (Arthur) Lewis. The Cheneys made their home in Boston, with a summer estate on Calf Island. The couple were childless.
In August 1899 Andrew Christeson was elected to succeed Cheney as a director of Wells Fargo. It is not said that Cheney had resigned, nor is any other information given in the meeting minutes.
As a young man Cheney had taken part in amateur theatricals, and after his marriage he financed a number of professional productions, including a number that starred his wife at venues in Boston, New York City and elsewhere in the Northeast. She also appeared in ten silent films between 1908 and 1919. Her last screen performance was a benefit film to aid victims of World War I. Julia Arthur Cheney made her last Broadway performance in 1921, playing Lady Macbeth opposite Lionel Barrymore. 
The Cheneys were also patrons of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where they donated a number of antiquities.
Cheney later suffered heavy financial reverses, and during the last years of his life he was no longer active in business. He died of thirst in the desert near Kingman, Arizona, on June 5, 1942 - ironically, alongside the tracks of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Julia Arthur Cheney died in Boston on March 28, 1950.

Piet (horse)

Piet (foaled 1945) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning three consecutive runnings of the Jamaica Handicap. Bred by Charles B. Bohn and Peter A. Markey, they raced him under their "nom de course", BoMar Stable. Piet was sired by multiple stakes winner, Grand Slam, a son of 1927 American Horse of the Year, Chance Play.

At age two, Piet won two races in Maryland, taking the 1947 Spalding Lowe Jenkins Stakes and the Richard Johnson Stakes at Laurel Park Race Course but got his most important victory of the year at Chicago's Arlington Park when he won the Arlington Futurity.
In his three-year-old debut, Piet won the Ral Parr Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. His other significant win of 1948 saw him defeat Coaltown in capturing the Skokie Handicap at Washington Park Race Track. In 1949, Piet won the first of his three straight editions of the Jamaica Handicap at Jamaica Racetrack. The following year, in addition to another Jamaica Handicap, Piet also won the Whitney, Toboggan, and Bay Shore Handicaps.
1951 was six-year-old Piet's last year of racing. He won his third consecutive Jamaica Handicap and notably ran second to Casemate in the Metropolitan Handicap and was third behind winner Arise in the Carter Handicap.

International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics

The International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) is an annual astronomy competition for high school students. It is one of the international science olympiads.
The Olympiad was founded from a dissidence inside the International Astronomy Olympiad, in order to increase the scope of the organization. The first IOAA website states that:
The first IOAA was held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in November/December 2007. The subsequent annual meetings were held during August/September or October in Indonesia (2008), Iran, China, Poland (2011), Brazil, and then Greece in 2013. The 2014 IOAA has been planned for Suceava, Romania, from 1 to 10 August 2014, and then followed by Indonesia during 2015 (see more below: Host countries).
History.
The first IOAA was held in the city of Chiang Mai, Thailand, from November 30 to December 9 of 2007, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the King Bhumibol Adulyadej and the 84th anniversary of the Princess Galyani Vadhana. The countries that attended to the first edition were: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Greece, India, Indonesia, Iran, South Korea, Laos, Lithuania, Myanmar, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Ukraine. The International Board, composed by the leaders of every attending country, became the solely decision body of the olympiad. At that time, there was already at work, for a five-year term, a President (Dr. Boonrucksar Soonthornthum, Thailand) and a General Secretary (Dr. Chatief Kunjaya, Indonesia).
The second IOAA was held in 2008, August 19 to 28, in the city of Bandung, Indonesia, having the participation of 22 countries –- including a team from Cambodja and an observer from Malaysia.
The third IOAA was held in 2009, October 17 to 27, in the capital Tehran, Iran. The observational exam was held in the desert, in the Caravanserai of Deh Namak. 20 countries participated –- the first time for Khazakstan and Serbia.
The fourth IOAA was held in 2010, September 12 to 21, in the capital Beijing, China. One-hundred fourteen competitors attended, coming from 23 countries –- the first time for Czech Republic, Philippines and Russia.
The fifth IOAA was held in 2011, August 25 to September 4, around the cities of Katowice, Chorzów and Kraków, Poland. This was the first IOAA to be held in Europe. The participants came from 26 countries, including the first time coming Bulgaria, Colombia, Croatia, Hungary and Portugal. In Poland, the International Board elected, from 2012 on, a new President (Dr. Chatief Kunjaya, Indonesia) and a General Secretary (Dr. Greg Stachowski, Poland). They also indicated two Regional Coordinators (Dr. Thaís Mothé Diniz, Brazil, for Americas and Dr. Aniket Sule, India, for Asia and Pacific).
The sixth IOAA was held in 2012, August 4 to 13, at Rio de Janeiro and Vassouras, Brazil—the first time in America. The participants came from 28 countries.
The seventh IOAA was held from 27 July to 4 August 2013 at Volos, Greece. Total 39 teams from 35 countries participated in the event. These included first time teams from U.S.A., New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, Armenia, the Republic of Macedonia and Cyprus.
Host countries.
Note: Hosts from 2015 onwards were decided on tentative basis (subject to availability of funding) during the seventh IOAA.
Format.
The IOAA is organized annually in a different host country, which shall cover all costs with every team during the event (includin lodging, food, excursions, awards, etc.). Having no registration fee, the participating countries shall only cover the expenses for its own team to arrive at the host place.
Each participating country sends one regular team with up to five (5) high school students (or students who finished their high school within the year of the competition), accompanied by two team leaders, normally scientists or teachers. In addition, the host country has the right to send one additiona, guest team.
Exams.
One differential in astronomy tests is the great importance of knowing the skies and of carrying systematic observations, something as important as the formulation of hypotheses and theories. Therefore, an astronomy competitor should be tested both in his theoretical and practical skills. Furthermore, it is also very important to know how to work collaborativelly, in a team.
Typically then, an IOAA participant faces four exams:
Although the official working language of IOAA is English, each exam is translated beforehand, by the team leaders of each country, for the student's native languages.
The host country should have an academical jury which should prepare, apply and give marks to the exams. But the team leaders have an important role on it, in the following steps:
Prize nomination.
The criteria for prize nominations at IOAA is as follows: the average of the three biggest marks makes 100%. 
In addition to that, the first mark overall receives a special prize as "absolute winner". The best marks in each of the exams (theoretical, data analysis and observational) also receive special prizes. Furthermore, each host country can offer other special prizes as well (in 2009, Iran offered the prizes of "most creative solution", "most concise answer", "most organized answer", "most skillful observer" and "most calm observer").
Prizewinners.
Team competition.
The first two IOAAs used a system of aggregating the three best scores (testwise) of each team to decide the official team rankings. This system was abandoned in later years and a team competition has been introduced from 2010 where the entire team works a task or a set of tasks together and scores are awarded to the entire team. These scores are not added to participant's individual scores of other rounds. The table lists only the top five countries or teams.
Medal tally.
Country-wise rankings as per the medal tally of the first six IOAAs is shown. The table lists only top ten countries and teams. "Guest teams" denote second teams from the same country.
Best Exams Prizes.
Also, IOAA offers special prizes for the best students in each category:
High-scoring participants.
The following table lists multiple (triple and more) gold medal winners of IOAA with their ranks and corresponding years.
Note: Several countries (e.g. India, Indonesia, Iran) do not allow their students to compete in IOAA for more than two times, even if they are eligible. Thus, statistics from those countries are not included in the table above.

Death or Glory (album)

Death or Glory is the fifth studio album by German heavy metal band Running Wild, released November 8, 1989 through Noise Records. Being one of their most successful releases, it contains the concert favourites "Riding the Storm" and "Bad to the Bone". The final track, "March On", was not included on the vinyl release due to space constraints.
The CD version (both the original and remastered) of the album contains 1991's "Wild Animal" EP, albeit with a different running order than that of the original. However, despite the presence of "Wild Animal" EP on the original pressing CD, neither the booklet nor back insert tray mention these songs. But the CD non-playing side (of the original pressing), however, does list the 4 songs from this EP. The booklet on the remastered version has the full info on including of the EP.
Running Wild filmed a live video to the song "Bad to the Bone", recorded in Düsseldorf. The song had some airtime at MTVs Headbangers Ball. "Riding the Storm" also had a live video that was also shot in Düsseldorf with a crowd of nearly 9,000 attendees.
The track "Bad to the Bone" was recorded by a cappella band van Canto and was released on their fourth studio album Break the Silence.

In 2005, "Death or Glory" was ranked number 285 in "Rock Hard" magazine's book of "The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time".

List of North American light rail systems by ridership

__NOTOC__ 
The following is a list of all light rail systems in North America, ranked by ridership. Daily figures for American and Canadian light rail systems are average weekday unlinked passenger trips, unless otherwise indicated. For light rail systems in the United States and Canada, these figures come from the American Public Transit Association (APTA) Ridership Reports statistics. For Mexico, the figures are obtained from Banco de Información Económica's Instituto Nacional de Estadísitica y Geografía (INEGI), and the daily figures represent daily passenger trips "averaged from the monthly and Quarterly ridership figures". All figures are from 2012 and the Second Quarter (Q2) of 2013, unless otherwise noted. 'Daily boardings per mile' figures have been rounded to the nearest 5 or 10. 
The question of which systems would count as 'light rail transit systems' is debatable, so this table includes some systems (such as Toronto's) which are technically "Streetcars" rather than "true" Light rail.

Rugby union playing record.
Besseling played 15 games for the NSW Waratahs from 2000 to 2001 and is a former second-rower and 1999 Ken Catchpole Medallist.
New South Wales political career.
Besseling was elected as an independent member in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the seat of Port Macquarie; winning the seat in a 2008 by-election following the resignation of former independent member Rob Oakeshott. Oakeshott resigned as Member for Port Macquarie and successfully ran for the federal seat of Lyne. Besseling worked as a political adviser for his sometime rugby teammate Oakeshott for the previous three years.
Besseling won the seat with 35.9 percent of the primary vote and 54.5 percent of the two-party vote. Alby Schultz, the Liberal Member for Hume, was seen campaigning a few times for Besseling, referring to him as "the pick of the candidates". Similar support was provided from Bill Heffernan, a Liberal Senator, sparking anger and resentment within the federal coalition.
In 2011 Besseling lost his seat to National Party candidate Leslie Williams. A swing of 11% against him was put down to his association to Rob Oakeshott, federal member for the Division of Lyne. Besseling's re-election campaign struck controversy when oil from his campaign bus caused an accident on the Oxley Highway that resulted in three people being seriously injured.
Following his failure to win re-election, Besseling recommenced employment as a political advisor, working in the office of Rob Oakeshott.
Local government.
In 2012, Besseling was directly elected as Mayor; and secured three other Councillors to the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council on his independent election ticket.

Ludwig Fischer

Dr. Ludwig Fischer (April 16, 1905 – March 8, 1947) was a German National Socialist lawyer, politician and a convicted war criminal.
Background.
Born into a Catholic family in Kaiserslautern, Fischer joined the Nazi Party in 1926 while a student, and the Sturmabteilung (SA) in 1929, eventually rising to the rank of Gruppenführer. In 1937, he was elected to the Reichstag.
Actions during Nazi occupation of Poland.
After the 1939 Invasion of Poland, he was appointed Governor of the Warsaw District in the occupied General Government (the area of Poland that was not formally annexed). He held this position until the withdrawal of the German forces from Warsaw in January 1945.
Fischer was directly responsible for a number of war crimes, as well as crimes against humanity. He was responsible for the creation of the Warsaw Ghetto, issued many anti-Semitic laws, as well as participating in the bloody Ghetto de-establishment and deportation. He was also responsible for many terrors in the occupied city, including mass executions, slave labor programs and deportation of Polish Jews to the various Nazi Concentration Camps. He was sentenced to death by the Special Courts of the Polish resistance movement for crimes against Polish citizens. His name was first on the list of "Operation Heads"—the serial assassinations of Nazi personnel by the Polish Resistance. Before the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, his car was shot at in Operation Hunting, but Fischer survived.
After the failure of the Warsaw Uprising, Fischer played an important role in the planned destruction of Warsaw by Nazi Germany. He was also responsible for the poor conditions in the temporary transit camp in Pruszków, which was built to intern people expelled from the capital.
Postwar trial and execution.
Fischer, then aged 41, was arrested after the war by Allied forces and was handed over to the Polish authorities. He was tried before the Supreme National Tribunal and sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging in Warsaw's Mokotów Prison. There is a film in existence showing the execution of Ludwig Fischer, which is sometimes misidentified in the media as that of Amon Goeth.

T-Rex (restaurant)

T-Rex is a Prehistoric themed restaurant that includes a gift shop, along with animatronic dinosaurs that move and roar. T-Rex has differently-themed restaurant sections, such as prehistoric insects (which includes enlarged animatronic insects), ice age (which includes ice caves and animatronic mammoths), and under the sea (complete with jellyfish ceiling and large aquarium). In the dinosaur-themed area, a gift shop allows customers to "Build-A-Dino", which is provided by Build-A-Bear Workshop who work in partnership with T-Rex.
T-Rex is owned by Landry's Restaurants, which started back in 1920 in Katy, Texas. Landry's went private in 2010 when Tilman Fertitta, the CEO of Landry's and a large shareholder, made an offer to buy all shares. Landry's is no longer traded on the NYSE.
The first T-Rex restaurant opened in Kansas City, followed by the opening of another at Downtown Disney in Walt Disney World, on October 17, 2008. (It appears to have been themed around the Rite of Spring segment of Fantasia.) It features Tyrannosaurus rex, Apatosaurus, Triceratops, mammoths, Stegosaurus, Parasaurolophus, and multiple pterosaurs, sea jellies, large insect models, alongside a Pachycephalosaurus, 13-foot wide octopus, and 2 fish tanks. There is a 2-min. meteor shower with various sized asteroids, and the ice cave turns from a blue or purple-pink color to orange to give the feeling it is melting, and all animals hoot, roar, and go berserk. T-Rex has a fossil dig in which kids can uncover a T-Rex or find their own fossils to keep and/or split a geode open. They have interactive touch screens that have games, toon clips, and things to learn about several of the creatures at the restaurant. Outside there is an Argentinosaurus skeleton and on the other side a parasaurolophus sits in a pond fed by a waterfall with some plants by it. The restaurant looks like a forest with snowy mountains in the middle.

Slamet Abdul Sjukur

Slamet A. Sjukur (Born in 1935 in Surabaya), is the founding father of contemporary Indonesian music. He studied and worked in Paris under Olivier Messiaen and Henri Dutilleux. He was a lecturer at IKJ (Institut Kesenian Jakarta) but because of his unconventional ideas, he finally had to leave. He has been living in Jakarta and Surabaya as a freelance composer, teacher and music critic. Developing the idea of minimax in music, his compositions are "notable for their minimal constellation of sounds and for their numerological basis which indicate the composer’s interest in a new ‘ecology of music’".
This idea views limitation not as obstructions but as a challenge to work with a simple material, maximally.
His honors include the Bronze Medal from the Festival de Jeux d’Automne in Dijon (1974), the Golden Record from the Académie Charles Cros in France (1975, for Angklung) and the Zoltán Kodály Commemorative Medal in Hungary (1983). More recently, "Gatra" named him a Pioneer of Alternative Music (1996) and he was made an Officier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2000) and a life member of the Akademi Jakarta (2002). Some of his prominent students include Gilang Ramadhan and Soe Tjen Marching.

List of special editions of Today (NBC program)

On the NBC morning news program Today, the designation "special edition" often applies to instances wherein one or both hosts anchor the program from a location other than Studio 1-A, or in the event of significant news developments. The expansion of an episode is not at all unusual, usually for planned long-duration news events such as presidential inaugurations or elections. The first such expanded edition came on January 20, 1953, with the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Breaking news can also extend the show's hours: during the July 7, 2005 London bombings and Friday following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, "Today" remained on the air for six hours, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. EDT.
Most special editions are introduced as ""From NBC News, this is a special edition of" Today".
These were just some of the special editions of "Today" that were broadcast.
1950s.
1952.
February.
When news of the death of Britain’s King George VI reached New York in the early morning hours of Wednesday, February 6, 1952, the plan for that morning’s show was thrown out and the program instead covered the monarch’s death. News anchor Jim Fleming helped lead coverage that day, and live analysis was provided by NBC foreign correspondent H.V. Kaltenborn.
March.
In part to bring the new show to a wider audience, NBC partnered with Time Magazine to produce a special primetime edition of "Today". Dave Garroway, Jack Lescoulie and Jim Fleming anchored the half-hour edition, which aired at 9:00 p.m. ET on Monday, March 31, 1952.
July.
"Today" staff covered the 1952 Republican National Convention in Chicago from July 7–11, 1952. News anchor Jim Fleming traveled to Chicago, and Dave Garroway and Jack Lescoulie remained in New York. To bring the event to the nation, 55 microphones were placed around the convention hall, along with eight cameras and miles of coaxial cables. Ten cities were added to the NBC network for the event, mainly west of the Mississippi River, bringing the estimated audience to some 70,000,000 Americans. The same procedure was followed for the Democratic National Convention, held in the same building July 21–26.
1953.
January.
January 20, 1953: "Today"'s first presidential inauguration coverage—the first inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower. Dave Garroway and Jack Lescoulie anchored from New York. News anchor Jim Fleming broadcast from Washington for the day’s coverage. NBC correspondent Merrill Mueller demonstrated the network’s first portable Vidicon television camera, employed for the first time that day.
March.
Soviet leader Joseph Stalin died on March 5, 1953. The time difference between Moscow and New York meant "Today" would get first crack at the story. The hastily-assembled show that morning included analysis from "Today" news anchor Jim Fleming, who once worked in NBC's Moscow bureau, and veteran NBC foreign correspondent Hans von Kaltenborn. Alexander Kerensky, a former leader of the Russian Provisional Government, was awakened and brought to the RCA Exhibition Hall to add his commentary on Stalin's death.
Twelve days later, March 17, 1953, Garroway hosted the show from the Nevada Test Site to cover an atomic bomb test. The nuclear detonation was carried live on "Today" at 8:20 a.m. ET (5:20 a.m. local time).
June.
Tuesday morning, June 2, 1953: "Today" covered the coronation of Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, in collaboration with the BBC. The BBC provided live audio of the ceremonies. Still pictures taken from television screens in London were faxed to the RCA Exhibition Hall studio, where Garroway would show them to viewers. Multiple correspondents from both NBC and the BBC offered commentary and analysis, both in-studio and on location at Westminster Abbey. Coronation coverage began at 5:00 a.m. EDT and concluded at 9:00 a.m. EDT.
1955.
January.
The show originated from Miami Beach the week of January 10–14, 1955. The trip was a coordinated effort among "Today", "Tonight Starring Steve Allen" and "Home" with Arlene Francis. A blurb in the "New York Times" promised "Seminole Indians wrestling eight-foot alligators, an underwater sound interview and a Dixieland band."
October.
"Today" originated from Kansas City, Missouri, on Tuesday, October 18, and Wednesday, October 19.
1956.
April.
"Today" broadcast from Los Angeles the week of April 30 - May 4, 1956, in part to inaugurate cross-country NBC News service. In an unusual step, "Huntley-Brinkley Report" anchor Chet Huntley anchored alongside Dave Garroway for the week.
July.
Thursday, July 26, 1956: Coverage of the overnight sinking of the Italian ocean liner , which foundered off the coast of Massachusetts. Home-movie film of the aftermath, shot by a passenger, was secured by a "Today" producer and broadcast on the show. Reporters Paul Cunningham and Dick McCutcheon provided analysis of the collision and subsequent sinking.
August.
Monday, August 20, 1956, Garroway and Lescoulie hosted the show from San Francisco, part of NBC's coverage of the 1956 Democratic National Convention.
October.
"Today" originated from New Orleans, Louisiana on October 19, 1956. Segments included a performance from the Al Hirt Dixieland Jazz Band.
1957.
September.
September 2–6, 1957, "Today" originated from Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the first time an American network program broadcast from outside the United States for an extended period.
October.
The entire first hour of the Wednesday, October 2, 1957, edition was dedicated to a discussion of racial issues in America, moderated by Dave Garroway. Guests included American Civil Liberties Union Chairman Ernest Angel, Reverend Theodore Braun, Mississippi Senator James Eastland, and National Urban League director Lester Granger. The hour mixed live discussion and commentary with taped reports from northern and southern cities.
1959.
April.
The week of April 27–May 1, 1959, "Today" originated from Paris, France. Garroway and company spent a week in the French capital, focusing on the art, culture, history and politics of France. Brigitte Bardot and Charles Van Doren appeared on the show. In the days before satellite communications, the Paris shows could not be broadcast live in the United States. Each day's edition was filmed in advance, developed, edited and flown back to New York to be shown the next morning. Both the Paris 1959 and Rome 1960 remotes were broadcast in this manner.
September.
The Tuesday, September 15, 1959, edition of the show was dedicated to an in-depth examination of the life and politics of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, tied to Krushchev's visit to the United States that week. Guests included reporters Martin Agronsky and Harrison Salisbury, along with George Allen, then-director of the U.S. Office of Information.
1960s.
1960.
January.
The eighth anniversary show, broadcast on Thursday, January 14, 1960, was taped entirely in Washington, D.C. Garroway and company visited the Library of Congress.

The cast toured the Supreme Court building and the White House, and Garroway delivered a commentary on the history of the White House while standing in front of the building.
April.
The week of April 11–15, 1960, "Today" traveled to Rome, Italy. The Spanish Steps and the Coliseum were toured. Garroway interviewed actor Peter Ustinov, and examples of the culture and society of Italy were demonstrated. The Vatican was toured on Good Friday, April 15. As with the Paris remote the previous year, the Rome segments featuring Garroway and Jack Lescoulie were pre-taped and sent to New York to be spliced with live news updates anchored by Frank Blair and Florence Henderson.
1962.
April.
Host John Chancellor, along with Frank Blair, anchored the show from the 1962 World's Fair on Thursday, April 26, 1962. Blair demonstrated a machine that calculated satellite orbits.

1963.
May.
Thursday morning, May 16, 1963, "Today" went on the air at 1:15 a.m. Eastern Time to provide overnight coverage of Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper's flight. The 22-orbit mission marked the end of Project Mercury.
November.
On November 23, 1963, "Today" aired a special three-hour Saturday program recapping the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the previous day. Host Hugh Downs, Jack Lescoulie, and newsreader Frank Blair anchored the broadcast. In the opening minutes, Downs noted that the atmosphere that day "was very different" from what he had ever previously experienced. Lescoulie recalled how traffic in New York City after the assassination was at a standstill, and that telephone circuits were jammed. Downs added that as the hours passed, the country's grief would turn into a "more historic kind of grief." Man-on-the-street reports were gathered by Barbara Walters. Sander Vanocur reported from the White House, with Martin Agronsky in Washington and Pauline Frederick at the United Nations in New York.
The Monday, November 25, 1963, edition covered President Kennedy's funeral. Downs anchored from an NBC Washington studio, while Blair, Walters, and Vanocur in Washington provided standup reports. For Walters, this marked the first time she had reported on a national event, as she reported from outside the United States Capitol, where Kennedy lay in state, saying, "These are the honor guards who have been guarding the casket of President Kennedy."

Marines' Memorial Club

The Marines Memorial Club in San Francisco, California at 609 Sutter Street (at Mason), is a private social club for United States Marines and other veterans of the United States Armed Forces. The nonprofit Marines Memorial Association owns the large building in the Union Square neighborhood of San Francisco that houses a hotel, theater, restaurant/bar, sports club, special event facilities, library, museum, memorial, and a military history bookstore.
History.
As a port city, San Francisco has since its founding by Spain been associated with military personnel, naval personnel, and merchant mariners. During World War II it was a point of embarkation for many sailors in the Pacific, who would keep fond memories of their few days in the city before leaving for the war.
The Marines Memorial was opened as a club for veterans of the Marines, although membership is open to all United States servicemen and servicewomen. Early in 1946, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Alexander A. Vandegrift, had proposed a "living memorial" to Marine casualties from the War in the Pacific. A group of Marines arranged to buy a building owned by a women's club at Mason Street and Sutter Street in San Francisco, whose members they had met through their participation in the wartime WAVES program. The club opened on November 10, 1946, the anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps.
The theater predates the club, and was part of the original 1926 building. In its early days it hosted nationwide radio broadcasts by Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra. It later housed the San Francisco Actor's Workshop, which produced plays by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and Bertholt Brecht. It was also the first home of the American Conservatory Theater.
Today the Association has 21,000 members from all branches of the United States military, NOAA, and the Public Health Service, mostly from California.

Birgit Ridderstedt

Birgit Ridderstedt (November 26, 1914 – September 16, 1985) was a Swedish-American folk singer and cultural ambassador who appeared at festivals and on television in the 1950s and early 1960s with material she produced herself.
Background.
Born in Ludvika, Sweden, a daughter of Stefan Anderson and Ragnhild Fredrika Sandberg, she immigrated with her husband C. Erik Ridderstedt and two small sons to the United States in 1950, settling in Chicago and later in Batavia, Illinois.
Career.
Ridderstedt was a cultural personality who gave presentations of Scandinavian music and folklore on WTTW and WGN television in Chicago in the 1950s and early 1960s. Her television appearances on public service and eventually for commercial channels in Chicago added to her notoriety in the Chicago media market. Ridderstedt opened her own gift shop and organized entertainment for festivals and parades especially popular with Scandinavian-Americans in the Fox Valley (Illinois). She worked to establish a previously unusual cooperation between any talented residents she could find of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish extraction. Ridderstedt returned to Sweden in 1962 with her family, but was also active in western Florida in the 1970s with her folk song programs.
The Ridderstedt couple lived in the Stockholm suburb of Täby when retired; he died in 1982. Their family grave is found in Stora Tuna Churchyard. Birgit Ridderstedt was the mother of Swedish-American writer and entertainment director, Jacob Truedson Demitz.
Songs.
Ridderstedt also wrote songs of her own in the early 1950s which have been registered with STIM. “Twinkling Stars” was used in 1975 in "AlexCab" for a parody of "The Osmonds"; and ”I Love Christmas Time” for a single gramophone record in 1990 with Agneta Lindén and Ola Isedal;. In 2013 "She Gave Me My Darling Man" and "It All Is Meant for You" were used in a "cabaret noir" at Michelangelo restaurant in Stockholm's Old Town.

Wort Hotel

The Wort Hotel was built in downtown Jackson, Wyoming by brothers John and Jess Wort, who were significant figures in the transformation of the economy of Jackson Hole from ranching to tourism. The somewhat Tudor-style building was the first luxury hotel in Jackson. The two story building features brick facing, with half-timbering and stucco on the second floor and a series of gables facing the street.
The hotel was built on property that had been bought by Charles Wort, father of John and Jess, who operated a livery stable on the site from 1915 to 1932. From 1932 to 1940 the Wort Family operated what is now Signal Mountain Lodge in Grand Teton National Park, until the Wort Hotel was opened in 1941. In 1950 the Silver Dollar Bar was added, with 2032 uncirculated silver dollars embedded in the surface of the bar. 
Wort Family.
Charles J. Wort first arrived in Jackson Hole in 1893 at age 19 to visit his brother Hamilton and half brother Stephen Leek. Charles remained to homestead in the South Park region of Teton County. After a trip to his native Nebraska to marry his wife Luella Perkins in 1899 he returned with Luella. In the early 1900s he began to work as an outfitter, assisted by his sons John and Jess. The Worts began to assemble land in the center of Jackson in 1915 with the aim of eventually building a hotel. In the meantime Charles built the Wort Livery Stable and Corral on the property, operating until 1932, along with the Wort Garage at Broadway and Cache. In 1917 Charles and Luella bought the Jackson Hotel at North Cache and Deloney, operating it for slightly more than a year. In 1925 they built a house across from the future hotel on West Broadway, ending their career as ranchers. The house was moved to Wilson, Wyoming in the 1960s. They had previously built a log cabin at Broadway and Cache for their sons to stay in when inclement weather prevented them from returning home from school in Jackson. Known as the Wort boys' cabin, it was later used as a law office by Will Simpson. Moved into Town Square, it was used by a stagecoach ride concession until 1996, when it was given to Simpson's grandson, Senator Alan Simpson who reportedly moved it to Cody.
During the 1920s the Worts obtained the first concession in Grand Teton National Park at Jenny Lake, where they ran a boating concession. In the 1930s the Worts operated their hunting concession in the Gros Ventre Mountains at what is now the Gap Puche Cabin. In 1932 the Worts purchased the Ole Warner Camp on Jackson Lake, naming it the Wort Lodge and Camp and operating it until 1940 when it was sold as the Signal Mountain Lodge. The proceeds from the sale financed the construction of the Wort Hotel, undertaken by John and Jess, Charles having died in 1933.
Hotel.
The Wort Hotel was designed by Idaho amateur architect Lorenzo "Ren" Grimmett. Grimmett is stated to have subsequently designed a near twin to the Wort, the Stage Coach Inn, in West Yellowstone, Montana. The Wort was finished just before the outbreak of World War II. Despite wartime restrictions, the hotel became popular with servicemen on furlough. Gambling was officially illegal, but tolerated until the 1950s, when Wyoming Governor Milward Simpson began a campaign against gambling. At the Wort, gambling retreated to the basement Teton Room, locally known as the "Snake Pit." Gambling finally ceased in the mid 1950s.
A fire in 1980 severely damaged the hotel, destroying much of the second floor, but it was reopened in 1981 with minimal changes. In 1984 the hotel was sold out of the Wort family. The hotel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. 
In 2009, AAA named the Wort Hotel one of the top 10 historic U.S. hotels.

Umgeni Steam Railway

Umgeni Steam Railway - a railway preservation group, started in 1982 subsequent to the donation of a small Dubs loco by Illovo Sugar, now located just outside Durban in a small village called Inchanga. The history of the line they use dates back to the 1880s when the first railway line was built to run from Durban-Pietermaritzburg (90 km by road). The line runs through a 53M long tunnel at Drummond built in 1878, and is probably the oldest tunnel in use today in South Africa. The Class-3BR loco, in use every month, was built by North British Locomotive Company (Scotland, UK) in 1912 and she celebrates her 100th birthday in February 2012. The coaches used range from 1908 through to 1953, with most being built in the 30's.
Excursion Trains.
On the last Sunday of every month excursion trains are run from Kloof to Inchanga. Special trains are sometimes run further south to Durban and/or further north to Pietermartizburg.
Museum.
At the old Station Master's House next to the Inchanga Station, a SAR Museum called the Inchanga Railway Museum has been opened. The Museum is open to the public every Sunday, and tea, coffee, breakfast and lunch is served in the tea garden. On train running days, a buffet is served at lunch.
Bookings for breakfast, lunch or the buffet can be made on the Umgeni Steam Railway website for running days, or at Bevelart for all other days. To organize school excursions or to make appointments to view the museum other than on Sundays, go to the Bevelart website and email Bev.
Routes.
The Umgeni Steam Railway currently operate trains on the last Sunday of each and every month throughout the year between Kloof and Inchanga, with special trains running from Pietermaritzburg to Inchanga and Nottingham Road. The route from Kloof to Inchanga follows the old main line from Durban to Pietermaritzburg and traverses some of the steepest railway gradients in South Africa (1:30 to 1:50).
Fleet.
The fleet of steam locomotives includes a Class 3BR, Class 12R, Class 14R, two Class 19Ds, a Class GF Garratt and a Class GMAM
Garratt, along with the locomotive that the company was started with - namely an 1892 vintage Class A "Dübs A".

William Anderton

William Anderton (born 1879 in Blackpool) was an English professional footballer. He spent six years at Blackpool in the 1900s, making over 100 Football League appearances for the club. He played in midfield.
Anderton made his debut for Blackpool on 21 December 1901, in a 3–0 home victory over Gainsborough Trinity. He went on to make a further twenty appearances in the 1901–02 season, scoring four goals.
In the 1903–04 campaign, Anderton was an almost ever-present, appearing in 33 of the club's 34 league games. He sat out the entire 1904–05 season, however, due to injury. 
Anderton almost missed the entire 1905–06 season too, but made his return to the team on 14 April 1906, with four league games remaining. He appeared in only one more of those four games, however.
In his final season with Blackpool, 1906–07, Anderton made eighteen league appearances and scored two goals. His final appearance for the club occurred on 20 April 1907, a 4–3 victory over Grimsby Town at Bloomfield Road in the penultimate match of the season.

October 2008 Central America floods

The October 2008 Central America floods were caused by a series of low pressure areas including Tropical Depression Sixteen, a short-lived tropical cyclone in the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season that made landfall in Honduras. Heavy rainfall began in early October 2008 while a tropical wave passed through the region. On October 14, Tropical Depression Sixteen formed just off the northeast coast of Honduras, and at the same time a low pressure system was on the Pacific coast. Both systems increased rainfall across the region, although the depression dropped heavy rainfall close to its center when it moved ashore on October 15. Although Tropical Depression Sixteen quickly dissipated over land, its remnants persisted for several days. Another low pressure area interacted with a cold front on October 21, adding to the rainfall in the region.
Heavy rainfall extended from Costa Rica to southeastern Mexico, causing what was considered the worst natural disaster in the region since Hurricane Mitch in 1998. In the former country, rainfall totaled 2,100 mm (83 in) over several weeks, making the week ending October 17 the wettest in San José since 1944. Floods in Costa Rica damaged 32 bridges and roads in 174 locations, while 1,396 homes were damaged, killing seven people. In Nicaragua to the north, weeks of heavy rainfall killed 16 people and damaged or destroyed 1,333 houses. In Honduras where the tropical depression made landfall, rainfall reached 1.2 m (4 ft) in some areas, although the highest official total there related to the depression was 360 mm (14.19 in) on the offshore Roatán over six days. About 40% of municipalities in the country experienced flooding, forcing over 50,000 people to leave their homes. The floods damaged about 50% of roads in Honduras, and over 10,000 houses were damaged or destroyed. Damage totaled about 3 billion lempiras (HNL, $225 million USD), and there were 60 deaths.
In northern Guatemala, the floods damaged about of crop fields, accounting for Q128.9 million (2008 GTQ, $16.8 million USD) in crop damage. There were 17 deaths and about 4,000 damaged houses in Guatemala. In neighboring El Salvador, the rains contributed to October 2008 being the third wettest month across the country, after Hurricane Stan in 2005 and Hurricane Mitch in 1998. One person died, and hundreds were forced to evacuate their houses. In Belize, the rains flooded about 1,000 homes, forcing the evacuation of one entire town due to health reasons. The rains caused additional flooding following Tropical Storm Arthur striking the country in May, damaging a bridge that was rebuilt after Arthur. Natioinwide, the floods caused BZ$54.1 million (BZD, $27.1 million USD) in damage and two deaths.
Meteorological history.
Widespread rainfall occurred throughout Central America in early October 2008 due to the passage of a tropical wave through the region. Later, another tropical wave approached the region, which was believed to have left the west coast of Africa on September 17. The wave developed a low pressure area on October 10 in the southwestern Caribbean, with sporadic convection. On October 13, the system consisted of a large area of convection drifting northward offshore eastern Central America, and Dvorak classifications began, indicating gradual organization. At that time, there was another low pressure area on the Pacific coast, and both systems were producing rainfall across Central America.
At 1200 UTC on October 14, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated that Tropical Depression Sixteen developed about 85 km (50 mi) northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios, a point where the border of Nicaragua and Honduras meet the Caribbean. In the hours after the depression's formation, the convection decreased, and Hurricane Hunters indicated that the small low-level circulation was rotating around a broader circulation. Shortly after 1200 UTC on October 15, the weak tropical depression made landfall just west of Punta Patuca in northern Honduras, with a broad and ill-defined circulation. Continuing west-southwestward over land, the circulation dissipated on October 16 over the mountains of central Honduras, although the depression's remnants continued to produce rainfall across the region for several days. On October 21, a cold front was moving through the Yucatán peninsula, interacting with a newly formed low in the Gulf of Honduras to produce additional rainfall.
Preparations.
Around the time when the NHC began issuing advisories on the depression, officials issued a tropical storm warning for northern Honduras that eventually covered the country's entire coastline. A tropical storm warning was also issued for the coast of Belize. When the NHC began issuing advisories on the depression, the agency anticipated the depression would intensify into a strong tropical storm, based on low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures; however, the agency noted uncertainty in the track. A ridge to the north was expected to steer the nascent depression westward, and two tropical cyclone forecast models predicted the storm would continue west-northwestward to strike Belize. Other models forecast a more immediate landfall, which would limit intensification. While the storm was active, officials in Honduras issued a yellow alert for seven departments where heavy rainfall had occurred. A nationwide yellow alert was also issued for El Salvador, meaning there was potential for flooding and landslides, although alerts were dropped on October 21 when the threat of rainfall diminished.
Impact.
Although a weak tropical cyclone, the depression and its remnants dropped heavy rainfall across Central America for several days, spreading into Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize. In Honduras where it made landfall, rainfall peaked at 360 mm (14.19 in) on the offshore Roatán over six days. A member from Mercy Corps estimated the rainfall in October to have totaled around 1.2 m (4 ft) in some areas. On the mainland, rainfall reached 266 mm (10.47 in) at El Empalme. In El Salvador, the depression dropped heavy rainfall, mainly in the southern coastal portion, with a 24 hour peak of 239 mm (9.40 in) in Puerto Parada en La Unión. Over a period of eight days, rainfall in Belize reached 547 mm (21.52 in) at Baldy Beacon. Rainfall extended as far north as southeastern Mexico. Throughout the region, the flooding destroyed about 10,000 homes and left about 250,000 people homeless. News agencies considered the flooding the worst in the region since Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
According to Costa Rica's National Meteorology Institute, the week ending on October 17 was the wettest in San José since 1944. Over a period of several weeks, rainfall reached about 2,100 mm (83 in). The influence between the precursor to the depression and a low pressure area in the eastern Pacific caused flooding in Costa Rica that killed seven people. In Guanacaste Province, a landslide covered three cars, and in Monteverde, another landslide knocked over a power line that killed two people. In Parrita, an ambulance carrying four people was struck by a fallen tree, while in Puntarenas, another vehicle was struck by a tree, killing one of its occupants. Transport was disrupted in widespread areas in the north and south of the country due to landslides blocking roads. Across the country, the floods compromised roads in 174 locations and damaged 32 bridges. Flooding isolated about 6,900 people in 75 communities, and about 77,000 people were forced to leave their homes. Power outages affected 89 communities, and 424 water wells along the Pacific coast were polluted. Nationwide, the floods damaged 1,396 houses and 39 schools.
In early October, heavy rainfall began affecting Nicaragua, causing mudslides and flooding. The tropical depression added to weeks of heavy rainfall that killed 16 people, many caused by people attempting to cross swollen rivers. Toward the end of October 2008, Lake Managua overflowed, causing flooding in the capital city of Managua. Across the country, 2,273 people evacuated to storm shelters after the floods damaged or destroyed 1,333 houses. Transportation was disrupted when the floods wrecked four bridges and 154 mi (248 km) of highways. Classes were canceled in León and Chinandega departments. The crops in the latter department were almost entirely destroyed.
Following months of drought conditions, the heavy rainfall in Honduras caused flooding, initially in the southern and central portions, although the entire country experienced rainfall, with 40% of municipalities experiencing flooding. The rains caused widespread landslides, particularly in the western and central portions. In the capital city Tegucigalpa, the rainfall in October was estimated to have been twice the average annual total. In two locations, the Pan-American Highway was disrupted by either landslide or flooding, and widespread areas were isolated nationwide by flooded roads. According to Reuters, about 50% of the roads in Honduras were damaged during the floods, with 227 roads and 106 bridges damaged. A landslide near Corquín blocked a river and created a natural dam, forcing hundreds of nearby residents to leave. In Colón Department, the Tocoa River overflowed, while flooding in Atlántida damaged crop lands. A total of of crops were damaged, mostly in Comayagua Department. 14 water systems were damaged, and 150,000 people lost power in Olancho Department. Landslides in Tegucigalpa killed six and displaced about 500 people. In El Progreso, 375 inmates from a jail had to be evacuated to another facility. A total of 50,676 people were forced to evacuate in the country, most of whom stayed in shelters. 2,474 homes were destroyed in Honduras, with another 8,688 damaged or flooded. In addition, at least nine schools were damaged or destroyed. Nationwide, the floods killed 60 people, and damage was estimated at about 3 billion lempiras (HNL, $225 million USD). The low death toll compared to Hurricane Mitch was largely due to the widespread evacuations.
Floods in Guatemala overflowed rivers and caused landslides in Izabal and Petén departments, blocking many roads. The rising rivers damaged about 175 houses, forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes. About of crop fields were damaged or destroyed, including corn, rice, and beans, and crop damage nationwide was estimated at Q128.9 million (2008 GTQ, $16.8 million USD). About 2.5% of the national corn crop and 3.7% of the rice crop were wrecked during the floods. Nationwide, about 4,000 houses and 82 roads were damaged or destroyed, and 17 people died in the country from the floods. In neighboring El Salvador, floods affected the houses of about 600 families. High levels forced officials to release water from several dams, causing urban flooding. Along the coastline, the floods damaged maize and bean crops. The average rainfall across El Salvador for the month of October was 475 mm (14.76 in). This was the third highest for October since such record keeping began in 1971, after 2005 when Hurricane Stan struck and 1998 when Hurricane Mitch crossed the area. The tropical depression killed one person in the country.
In Belize, the rainfall in one week represented the average monthly values at some stations. Heavy rainfall from the depression caused levels to rise along rivers and creeks. A bridge that had been rebuilt following earlier Tropical Storm Arthur was flooded, prompting the Belize Defence Force to assist in crossings. This isolated much of Cayo District from the rest of the country until the bridge was repaired. On the western portion of the district, flooding along the Macal River damaged a bridge crossing into northern Guatemala, which restricted traffic only to people returning home. Levels along the Macal and the Belize River were higher than the floods of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, but less than that of Hurricane Keith in 2000. The floods caused residents to evacuate after over 1,000 homes were flooded; 311 people stayed in shelters, while the remainder stayed with families and relatives. Of the affected houses, 12 were destroyed and 802 were severely damaged. Most of the affected population was in rural areas of western Belize. One village in Orange Walk District had to be quarantined due to the health threat from the floods for 25 days. Many roads were closed, and there were widespread school closures. Overall, the floods killed two people in the country and caused BZ$54.1 million (BZD, $27.1 million USD) in damage. Most of the damage was agricultural, accounting for BZ$28.2 million (BZD, $14.1 million USD), or 25% of the country's agricultural gross domestic product. Other damage included BZ$11.7 million (BZD, $6.3 million USD) to roads and bridges. The ongoing floods caused BZ$2.7 million (BZD, $1.5 million USD) in tourism losses, due to closed facilities and water damage.
Aftermath.
Following the floods in Costa Rica, the country's Red Cross opened shelters to house storm victims. The government advised residents not to drink water out of fear it could be polluted from the flooding. A state of emergency was declared on October 18 due to the effects in Costa Rica. In Nicaragua, officials deployed about 3,000 soldiers to assist in flood operations. The World Food Programme provided about 8 tons of food to families in El Salvador affected by the flooding. Then-president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya declared a national state of emergency on October 19. In Honduras, pre-positioned supplies from UNICEF quickly diminished due to the widespread distribution of blankets and medical kits, raising fears for the spread of disease. The World Food Programme provided about 58 tons of food to 5,500 families in Honduras. Residents returned home as floodwaters gradually receded. The Mercy Corps later provided corn and bean seeds to 1,300 Honduran farmers to regrow the damaged crops. In May 2009, the World Bank provided $25 million (USD) to Honduras to rebuild damaged roads and bridges. Workers in Guatemala airlifted food to storm victims due to residual flooding. The Guatemalan government provided $6.6 million to residents in the northern portion of the country, including medical supplies and seeds to regrow crops. A state of emergency was declared for Cayo District in Belize. Search and rescue teams were deployed to the district, and medical crews visited several towns, providing help to 3,000 people. The Belize National Emergency Management Organization provided meals to about 9,000 people following the floods.
Across the affected areas, the Red Cross spent about $247,000 to provide food and blankets. In the weeks and months following the flooding, various international groups provided aid totaling nearly $11 million. The United States donated $622,732 worth of assistance, mainly to help with logistical work and relief efforts. The United States military also worked to purify drinking water in Honduras. Canada donated $412,201 worth of assistance, including providing shelter in Honduras and rebuilding schools. The country of Brazil donated about $1.68 million worth of food. The Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department of the European Commission provided nearly $2.2 million for relief efforts. Other European country donations included nearly $500,000 from Ireland for hygiene and food supplies, $675,675 from the Netherlands for general relief efforts, $154,570 from Spain through the World Food Programme, $159,559 from Germany for shelters, and $892,468 from Sweden. Several Asian countries donated to the relief efforts, including $123,810 from Japan to Honduras to purchase emergency goods, $22,000 from South Korea, and $10,000 from Singapore to Honduras. Non-governmental organizations and other groups providing aid included $1.5 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund, $300,000 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, $120,000 from Catholic Relief Services, and $289,000 from ACT Alliance.
In November, weeks after the tropical depression struck Honduras, Tropical Storm Paloma formed in the western Caribbean and caused additional rainfall in the region.

Jacob Truedson Demitz

Jacob Truedson Demitz (born Lars-Erik Jacob Ridderstedt on August 13, 1948) is a Swedish-American writer and entertainment director who wrote a 1996 book about Scandinavian kings and, as Lars Jacob, has directed hundreds of cabaret shows in the United States and Europe since 1972. He grew up in Illinois, returned to Sweden and later lived for extended periods in Florida and California.
Origin and names.
Demitz was born in Örebro, Sweden, the son of singer Birgit Ridderstedt and C. Erik Ridderstedt, and first arrived in the United States as an infant, then living in and near Chicago until the age of 13. Through his father's crafts-and-gifts import business and his mother’s entertainment ventures he was inspired early in an inter-cultural environment.
Not wanting to be mistaken for a cleric uncle also called "Lars Ridderstedt", who had gained notoriety in Sweden, he decided in 1969 to use Jacob as his first name of address. After noticing for many years the problems Americans had in using his parents' last name, he adopted the surname of Demitz in 1980, the original name from 1693 of the extinct House of Ridderstedt before nobility, and he was the first in 300 years to change his name back.
His patronymic Truedson added in 1990, stems from a Scanian great-great-grandfather Trued Abrehamsson, whose lineage has been traced back to the 1640s when the area and the family were Danish, and whose descendants outside of Europe inhabit many of the United States today.
Writer's career.
"Throne of a Thousand Years" (ISBN 91-630-5030-7) had more than 30 years of research by Demitz before it was published in 1996, appreciated particularly for its English-language name forms for Swedish royalty and a lack of nationalism. The book fulfilled collection requirements as a reference work and was included as such at more than 180 libraries, including the national libraries of 73 countries. It has been out of print since 2001.
Demitz's 500-volume historical library was accepted in advance for posthumous donation to the Folke Bernadotte Memorial Library at Gustavus Adolphus College, making him a member, as of 2005, of the college's Gustavus Heritage Partnership, named for King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden.
An STIM member since 1970, Demitz has scripted and directed Max von Sydow for television in English and written special lyrics for major corporations. He has also done a regular half-page editorial column in 1996–1997 for "Nya Ludvika Tidning" plus numerous other articles for selected press and information websites like Find A Grave.
Demitz's published song lyrics started with a record album for EMI in 1970 which had good reviews, and a single for Odeon the following year, that both included his Swedish version of Burt Bacharach's "Close to You". Other adaptations include "Santa Baby", "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" (both in Swedish), and an original company song in English for SAS Group called "Flying Time".
He also writes as a human rights activist, and his complaints led to the censure of one of the Sweden’s top judges in 1993, over erased trial tapes of testimony, and in 1995 to a nationally publicized debate over the use of young children to sell lottery tickets, commented on by a Cultural Minister in agreement.
In recent years, Demitz has reviewed and rewritten English text for Swedish individuals and organizations, including Karolinska Institutet in 2005.
Entertainment.
Having graduated "Studentexamen" that year at Mörby Läroverk (a junior college) in Danderyd, Sweden, specializing in languages and the musical arts, he desired within two years to cross the Atlantic again and moved to Florida. Attracting interest as a model of free-spirited European youth, he appeared in Tampa Bay area press and in 1972 as a featured guest on the talk shows of Herb Hunt and George Michelle.
A Stockholm disc jockey and dance leader in the early 1970s, Demitz choreographed disco scenes in an avant-garde motion picture "More from the Language of Love".
Returning there from Florida, he soon was Director of Entertainment for Sweden’s nightclub queen Alexandra Charles and in 1975–1976 put on celebrated shows for her and in Gothenburg that he had created earlier in Miami Beach. Fans of his decadent cabarets included the members of ABBA and tennis champion Björn Borg, who saw rambunctious new ground broken in domestic Swedish entertainment.
Lars Jacob’s mimical spoof "Wild Side Story" ran more than 500 times (1973–2004) in Florida, Sweden, California and Spain.
Demitz hosted a formal celebrity dinner at Berns on the Mae West Centennial in 1993. A month later his intended show extravaganza was cancelled there because of new demands from the restaurant due to insufficient sales of the SEK 1,000 tickets.
That same year and in 1995 he did some of his most appreciated performances as the "Preacher" in an outdoor musical event called "Farmer's Wedding" performed in his mother's native town of Ludvika and at the Stockholm Water Festival in the royal Kungsträdgården park.
For a youth project called "Läckerhetsvakten" (a pun on 'security guard' for youthful health and attraction), the F.U.S.I.A. cabaret school (1998–2005) where Demitz was the creative director, got one of Skandia's "Ideas for Life" grants in 2001.
He has also lived in Salzburg, Austria where his voice was schooled in 1968–1969 by Grete Menzel, has English and Swedish as primary languages and speaks fluent German, French and Spanish plus dialects and phrases of a number of other tongues. Being multilingual, and his entertainment background, worked for Demitz in 1999–2000 at the 5-star Palm Oasis resort (belonging to Interval International) on Grand Canary, where he became a successful timeshare agent and defended ethical practices only in that field. The work drew severe criticism anyway from press in Sweden, where all forms of timeshare have had bad publicity and have been frowned upon.
Since 2005 he is Chairman of nonprofit foundation Southerly Clubs and since 2006 Deputy Chairman of FamSAC, an international society of some 5,000 relatives, among them Stanley M. Truhlsen, Mattias Klum and Siri von Reis. Demitz has arranged and hosted international family reunions and commemorations, some of them large, in the Swedish capital and provinces of Sudermania, Scania and Dalecarlia as well as in New York City, New Jersey, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska and Wyoming.
For the CabarEng ensemble, from 2009 until his retirement in 2013, Lars Jacob directed Tuesday night cabarets such as "CaCa Bleu" and "ÄngelCab" (2013) in Stockholm. He went on tour in 2011 with the group doing "A Tribute Westward" and "Cabaret Large A-Cup" at venues in Manhattan, Washington DC, Annapolis and Boston. In retirement he is still consulted by cabaret groups and occasionally writes or lectures as a freelance inter-cultural communicator.
Awards.
Formally, Jacob Truedson Demitz wears The Beverly Hills Hotel’s five-year gold pin, from work 1976–1984 as Front Desk Manager and Duty Manager there, and a small decoration awarded in 1993 for various deeds in his Dalecarlian motherland by Sveriges Hembygdsförbund. The latter is the "Association of Swedish Homelands" and has over 1,900 homeland societies from all parts of that country as member organizations.

Ghosthunting With...

Ghosthunting With... was a British paranormal television programme based on investigating purported paranormal activity. Yvette Fielding hosts the programme, broadcast on digital channel ITV2 between 2006-2011, where she took celebrities to haunted buildings to investigate.
2006.
Girls Aloud.
Only four of the five members of Girls Aloud took part in the pilot episode of the show, which was set in North Wales. Nadine Coyle opted out of the show because she was too scared. This left Nicola Roberts, Kimberley Walsh, Cheryl Cole and Sarah Harding to go ghost hunting.
Plas Teg
Yvette gives the girls a tour of the house, where she speaks out. They hear knocking noises throughout the house. They then decide to have a séance. Nicola then leaves the group and retreats to the taxi and psychologist Professor Geoffrey Beattie. During the séance objects are thrown around the room, supposedly by a squire who used to work at the house. Cheryl feels something touch her arm just before the séance. After the séance, the group split to find more ghosts. Cheryl and Kimberley go downstairs, while Sarah and Yvette stay upstairs. When Cheryl and Kimberley return, Cheryl's finger is flicked, presumably by the ghost.
Crossley Hospital
The next site the girls visit is Crossley Hospital an abandoned sanatorium. The hospital itself is derelict, but there are many out-houses which the girls enter, such as the morgue and the nurses' quarters. In the morgue, Yvette decides to play with the Ouija board. Nicola opts out, but stays to watch. But while touring the morgue, she reached the end of her nerve and left the group again. She is soon followed by Sarah. The remainder of the group, accompanied by security, continue their expedition to the basement. Sarah decides to rejoin the group at this point. While in the basement, the group gets stones thrown at them. Cheryl, Kimberley and Sarah decide to call it a night and depart for the safety of the taxi and Geoff. But Yvette stays to face the spirit. But the longer she stays, the more stones get thrown at her so she decides to leave.
2007.
The Dingles ("Emmerdale").
In this episode Yvette takes Lucy Pargeter (Chastity Dingle), Verity Rushworth (Donna Windsor-Dingle), Hayley Tamaddon (Delilah Dingle), Joseph Gilgun (Eli Dingle) and Mark Charnock (Marlon Dingle), to three of the reputedley most haunted locations in York, including the National Railway Museum.
McFly.
For this episode, Yvette takes the McFly band into the Northumbrian countryside to visit three different locations. While the four band members were in high spirits for the tours of the locations, their personalities change completely upon switching to night-vision.
Underground mine
Yvette takes the band underground to explore a dark and damp mine; all five were required to wear hats and welly boots in order to pass through the mines. The first person to be scared is Dougie, who loses his hat, runs into the wall and cuts his lip upon being startled. Knocks are heard almost frequently whenever Yvette called out, and after a while suggests the group split up to explore the two different tunnels. Upon arriving at the end of their tunnel, Tom and Harry play a prank on Yvette, Dougie and Danny by knocking when she attempts to call out. However, their prank is apparently mimicked by an unseen entity, and the five decide to move on upon Harrys instructions to "leg it".
Forest & cottage
Yvette takes the boys to a forest, where a cottage, formerly used for keeping male slaves in cramped conditions, also resides. During a séance, Yvette and McFly make contact with a male spirit who throws a stone around the room. Next, Yvette prepares a challenge for the four of them; she assigns Tom and Dougie to one tent in the forest, and Harry to another. Danny, however, is told to remain in the cottage; after 15 minutes, Yvette blows a whistle as a sign for the boys to return to her. Danny gets freaked out when he hears knocking, Harry becomes too scared to do anything, and Tom and Dougie become distracted with a game to hide their fear; the two later admit to having felt like something was touching them during the challenge.
13th century castle
For the last part of the night, Yvette takes the band to a castle, where paranormal activity is said to be frequent. Harry even tries calling out to one of the spirits himself. After taking them on a tour around the castle, including an old smoking room (now a bedroom), a bathroom and a few old dungeons, Yvette begins her final challenge. She gives the boys a choice to stay in a haunted room for as long as they can handle, or wait outside in the taxi. Tom and Dougie are the only two to refrain from staying in their rooms. Danny stays in the dungeon, lasting a fair few minutes before being let out, while Harry is sent to the old smoking room, where he agrees to stay for only five minutes with security outside the room.
Radio 1.
BBC Radio 1 DJ's Scott Mills, Comedy Dave, Rachel Jones & Aled Haydn Jones, travelled to a Napoleonic fortress (which included a labyrinth maze of tunnels below ground), a guard house near to the fortress (said to be home to the spirits of three soldiers), Eastbury Manor (built upon the former site of Barking Abbey founded in 666) and their final destination of the night was the Caponier tunnels.
2008.

During the 2007 Most Haunted Live from Transylvania, in an interview, Yvette Fielding explained that Paul O'Grady had originally been lined up to take part in a Most Haunted celebrity special. This came after he took part in the Most Haunted Live in London during 2005. However, before filming could commence (which was scheduled for the end of 2006), Paul fell ill. Living TV decided to go ahead with the commission, with the exception of turning the recorded programme into a Live show.

The Saturdays.
Yvette takes on, The Saturdays to three haunted sites in Wales.
The girls visit three equally terrifying locations, nestled within the Welsh mountains; the clock tower, the manor and the kitchen block. In each of these areas there have been countless reports of strange sightings, the sounds of chatter coming from empty rooms, cooking smells coming from an empty kitchen, and reported ghostly sightings. During the time in the first location, Rochelle Wiseman said she felt someone touch her leg and someone blowing onto her neck.
The second ghostly hot spot is the eerie clock tower, which was constructed using beams taken from an ill fated ship. The tower is rumoured to be haunted by a restless spirit of a suicide victim and anyone who enters is confronted by his hostile presence.
The final destination of the evening is the manor. The girls will visit the foreboding first floor landing which has been noted as having the most paranormal activity in the building. Next up is the surgery room which was used by the Red Cross for injured soldiers during the first world war and finally the attic where the tormented spirit is said to sway back and forth in an old rocking chair. Strangely, it is said that female entertainers who would perform at the Manor for the former owner complained of being harassed by an evil presence.

Hassan Khomeini

Hassan Khomeini (born 3 December 1972, Persian: سيد حسن خمينی) is a "mid-ranking" Iranian cleric. Of Khomeini's 15 grandchildren he has been called "the most prominent" and the one "who many think could have a promising political future." 
Early life.
Hassan Khomeini is the grandson of the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini. He is the son of Ahmad Khomeini and Fatemeh Tabatabai. 
Career.
Hassan Khomeini became a cleric 1993. He was appointed caretaker of the Mausoleum of Khomeini in 1995 where his grandfather and father are buried, and has had official meetings with officials such as Syrian President Bashar Assad and Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. He is also teaching in the holy city of Qom, and has published his first book on Islamic sects.
He has been described as having "expressed frustration with some policies of a regime dominated by fundamentalists," such as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In an interview in February 2008, Hassan spoke out against military interference in politics. Soon after, in what some observers believe may have been retaliation, an article in a publication tied to President Ahmadinejad accused him of corruption, "claiming that he drove a BMW, backed rich politicians and was indifferent to the suffering of the poor." 
This was "the first time in the history of the Islamic Republic" that one of Khomeini's offspring was "publicly insulted," according to the Iranian daily newspaper "Kargozaran". Hassan met with reformers before the 2009 election and met with defeated presidential candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi and "supported his call to cancel the election results."

<doc id="19847525" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19847525" title="(Lil) Green Patch">
(Lil) Green Patch

(lil) Green Patch was a Facebook application developed by Ashish Dixit and David King that simulated a small garden on a Facebook user's profile. By tending their and their friends' gardens, the Facebook users were able to raise money for Nature Conservancy to save the rain forest. In September 2008 it was rated as the number one application on Facebook ahead of "Texas HoldEm Poker". In April 2009 it had slid to a sixth ranking.
(lil) Green Patch became unavailable to users on June 10, 2010, following a decision by new owners Playdom to discontinue this game.
Popularity and area of rain forest saved.
In the first quarter of 2008 (lil) Green Patch users raised over $15,000 in donations which was enough to save more than of rainforest. The application was then among the 15 most popular Facebook applications with 350,000 active users. In June, 2008 it was one of the top ten most installed applications with more than 5,217,180 installations and 521,718 active users a day. By October 2008, the app had raised $91,000 for the Nature Conservancy., and by December 2008 the number of users was reported at 6.3 million and the application was ranked as one of the five most popular Facebook applications. The area of Costa Rican rain forest that had been saved at that time was up to 70 million square feet.
In its final accounting, Causes.com, the independent charity clearinghouse for Facebook apps that processed its donations. reported that (Lil) Green Patch had generated $210,261 in contributions for the Nature Conservancy. As of December 2010, it remains the all time top recruiter for this charity with nearly 1200 users, more than double the next largest contributor.
Growing Controversy and Blog Comment Speculations.
Such success did not go unnoticed, leading a leading venture funded gaming company, Playdom, to acquire the independent Green Patch team in November 2009.
But its notoriety also drew detractors.
While Green Patch benefitted from the huge increase in Facebook members going on concurrently, many of these new Facebook users were unfamiliar with independent organizations such as Causes.com used to provide accountability for charitable contributions, but hyper aware of similar scams common elsewhere on the web. As a result, the accuracy of Green Patch's charity donation were widely questioned in blog comments. Although these speculations were shown to be unfounded, their frequent repetition may have unfairly tarnished the game's reputation.
Another source of controversy swirled about the amount of the donations relative to the size of the user population. Despite an average donation per contribution ratio exceeding $175 per contributor, some detractors disparaged the game by claiming total donations amounted to just pennies per user.
Demise of Green Patch and Diaspora of Team.
Rumors, speculation and controversy also surround the surprise cancellation of the still popular (Lil) Green Patch just 6 months after Playdom acquired the Green Patch team and the month immediately prior to the announcement of Playdom's acquisition by Disney. Playdom also announced they were canceling all other games from the GreenPatch except (Lil) Farm Life.
Also during the time between the rapid rise of (Lil) Green Patch and its subsequent acquisition and eventual cancellation, competitor Zynga initiated trade secrets lawsuits against Green Patch, Playdom and 22 other rivals. These lawsuits were settled subsequent to Disney's acquisition of Playdom. The timing of events in the lawsuit with events affecting the acquisition and cancellation added to the previous speculation that Playdom senior management sacrificed (Lil) Green Patch and the studio's other games in hopes of settling the legal dispute prior to the Disney acquisition.
Despite a user base of over 350,000 active users, Playdom announced it was shutting down (Lil) Green Patch and on June 10, 2010 the game was permanently discontinued. A user protest to get Playdom to resume the game was unsuccessful. In July 2010, Disney in turn completed its acquisition of Playdom. Disney restructured its games studios into a new Disney Interactive Media group, adding Playdom, while also shuttering several other older game studios.
In November 2010 Disney settled the Playdom and Green Patch suits with Zynga.
Within a year of cancellation of the game nearly all of the original Green Patch employees at the time of acquisition had left Playdom, including GreenPatch Inc. founders David King and Ashish Dixit, and (Lil) Green Patch Art Director and Game Designer, Tig Sylvan.

William Coleridge, 5th Baron Coleridge

William Duke Coleridge, 5th Baron Coleridge (born 18 June 1937) is an hereditary peer who lives in Ottery St Mary in Devon, England.
The son of Richard Duke Coleridge, the 4th Baron Coleridge, Coleridge was educated at Eton College in Berkshire, England, and at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Berkshire. He served as an officer in the Coldstream Guards in Kenya between 1961 and 1963. Coleridge was Commander of the Guards Independent Parachute Company between 1970 and 1972. He was Governor of the Royal West of England School for the Deaf. He retired from the British Army's Coldstream Guards with the rank of Major in 1977. He succeeded to the title of 5th Baron Coleridge of Ottery St. Mary in 1984 on the death of his father, the 4th Baron.
Coleridge married Everild Tania Hambrough, the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Beauchamp Hambrough, on 17 February 1962. They have three children, including Coleridge's only son, the Hon. James Duke Coleridge (b. 5 June 1967), the present heir to the Barony. A daughter is the model and actress Tania Harcourt-Cooze. The marriage was dissolved in 1977. Later that year he married Pamela Baker, daughter of George William Baker. He has two children from this second marriage. 
The ancestral home is The Chanter's House in Ottery St Mary in Devon. Coleridge was the last family member to live there because the increasing costs of maintaining the property caused the family trust in October 2006 to put the property up for sale and auction the contents. In 1999 Coleridge had attempted to lease part of the family estate in order to raise money to prevent the sale.

Blackwell Grange

Blackwell Grange is an early 18th-century country house at Blackwell, near Darlington, County Durham, England. Much altered in the 19th century, it is now an hotel. It is a Grade II* listed building.
The house was built about 1710 for George Allan, a wealthy industrialist who died in 1748. The three-storey, five-bayed central block was extended in the mid-18th century by the addition of two substantial two storey five bay wings and a ten bay south garden front.
Allan left the estate to his granddaughter, and in 1785 it passed to her cousin James Allan of Darlington. In 1828, it was bequeathed to George Allan, and from him it passed, in about 1850, to a cousin Robert Henry Allan (High Sheriff of Durham 1851), whose mother was Hannah Havelock.
In 1880, another cousin, Sir Henry Havelock Bt., came to the property on the condition that he changed his name to Havelock-Allan. The Havelock-Allan baronets held the estate until after the death of the second Baronet in 1953.
The estate park is now a golf course, The Blackwell Grange Golf Club, and the house is a Forestdale Hotel. In February 2013, it was announced the hotel will become part of the Choice Hotel franchise with a complete renovation of the bars, lounges and bedrooms.

Jean Malaquais

Jean Malaquais (1908 - December 22, 1998) was a French novelist.
He was born as Wladimir Jan Pavel Malacki in Warsaw in 1908 of a non-religious Polish family of Jewish descent. In 1926, he left Poland, traveling in Eastern Europe and the Middle East; he wrote: "I had the feeling that the end of the world was approaching in Poland, so I wanted to discover the life of other lands before it disappeared entirely. Morally and intellectually I was a tramp, a companion of the dispossessed." He settled in France, where he worked as a laborer, and adopted the name of Jean Malaquais (which he took from the Quai Malaquais). He was associated with, though not formally a member of, several French leftist organizations, including the Trotskyist Communist League, and during the Spanish Civil War he joined the Republican forces as a member of the militia columns of the left Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). He obtained the Prix Renaudot in 1939 for his novel "Les Javanais", based on his experience as an immigrant mine worker in Provence; it was admired by André Gide, who made Malaquais his private secretary.
At the beginning of World War II, he was conscripted into the French army, though not a French citizen. He was captured by the Germans, but managed to escape, and fled to southern France. In 1943, he succeeded in leaving France with the assistance of Varian Fry and the Emergency Rescue Committee bound for Mexico, and, eventually the United States, where he became a naturalised citizen; his parents died in Nazi concentration camps. He returned to France in 1947, but left again for the United States in 1948. (Beginning in 1942 and continuing after the war, he was a member of the Left Communist group Gauche communiste de France; in the United States, he was loosely affiliated with a number of non-Communist left groups.) His most famous work, about an international group of exiles in Vichy France, was "Planète sans visa" (1947), which has been translated into many languages.

Livin' with Lucy

"Livin' with Lucy" is an Irish television programme presented by Lucy Kennedy. First aired on 14 April 2008, the premise of the show is that Kennedy spends a weekend living with a different celebrity each episode, analysing their daily lives and interviewing them in their own homes all the while with cameras filming in the background. The show airs on RTÉ Two on Monday nights at 21:30. The programme has proven controversial, with Kennedy being stalked by paparazzi and some of the celebrities airing slanderous views.
Series two began on 20 October 2008. Series three began to air on RTÉ Two on Thursday 11 November 2010 and ended on 16 December 2010.
Episodes.
Series one.
Series one began on 14 April 2008. During filming of the show Kennedy was hunted by the paparazzi and subjected to vicious photography and googling when she stayed with British tabloid fodder Jade Goody. She encountered controversy whilst staying with Samantha Mumba when the singer launched a verbal attack on Irish radio presenter Dave Fanning, calling him a number of unprintable expletives. Senator David Norris was said to have commented: "I tire out people half my age. I had Lucy Kennedy staying with me for her "Livin' with Lucy" series and she had to go to bed for a week afterwards."
Series two.
Series two began on 20 October 2008. In the first episode presenter Lucy Kennedy spent three days with Shane Lynch in his caravan in Surrey. Don Baker enticed Kennedy into his jacuzzi and she also joined him on stage to play the tambourine.
Series three.
Series three began on 11 November 2010 and ended on 16 December 2010. 
Reception.
The "Irish Independent" claimed self-regard was Kennedy's "most striking trait" and derided her obsession with bodily functions ("poo" and "willies" are frequently mentioned). When Calum Best announced his reasons for taking part (he wanted to "tell the Irish people what's going on -- if they watch this shit show."), the newspaper suggested they give him a job as a critic. It was later named by the "Irish Independent" as one of its six worst television programmes of 2008.

<doc id="19847596" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19847596" title="USS Willoughby (AGP-9)">
USS Willoughby (AGP-9)

The second USS "Willoughby" (AGP-9) was a motor torpedo boat tender that served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946.
Construction and Deployment.
"Willoughby" was laid down as an "Barnegat"-class" small seaplane tender designated AVP-57 on 15 March 1943 at Houghton, Washington, by Lake Washington Shipyards. She was reclassified as a motor torpedo boat tender and redesignated AGP-9 on 11 May 1943. Launched on 21 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. D. R. Lee, she was commissioned on 18 June 1944 with Lieutenant Commander A. J. Church in command.
After fitting out and undergoing sea trials, "Willoughby" conducted her shakedown out of San Diego, California, from 9 July 1944 to 4 August 1944, exercising in antisubmarine warfare operations and antiaircraft and gunnery drills and running further speed trials. Following a post-shakedown periods in the shipyard at Terminal Island, California, from 5 August 1944 to 11 August 1944, "Willoughby" shifted to San Francisco, California, where she loaded stores before getting underway on 15 August 1944, bound for Funafuti in the Ellice Islands.
While she was en route, her destination was changed to Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands. "Willoughby" fueled and took on stores at Tulagi in the Solomon Islands on 1 September 1944 before she reached her destination, Seeadler Harbor, Manus, on 6 September 1944. Her stay there proved brief, however, for she got underway that day, bound for the Padaido Islands.
The voyage to Mios Woendi proved eventful, as "Willoughby" picked up a sound contact on sonar at 1335 hours on 7 September 1944, distance 1,000 yards (914 m). Going to general quarters, the ship commenced a run on what, after the executive officer had reported seeing a torpedo wake pass the ship, she believed to be a submarine. At 1342 hours, "Willoughby" dropped four depth charges and, although she lost contact with the submarine, continued her search of the area. Regaining a slight sound contact at 1512 hours, "Willoughby" made another run but did not drop depth charges. The ship secured from general quarters at 1632 hours, resumed her voyage, and arrived at Mios Woendi on 8 September 1944.
New Guinea campaign.
"Willoughby" tended patrol torpedo boats (PT boats) at Mios Woendi from 9 September 1944 to 12 October 1944. During that time, the New Guinea campaign was gradually coming to an end; PT boats operating from Mios Woendi were finding slimmer pickings to choose from in regard to Japanese barge traffic. All combat patrols from Mios Woendi finally ceased on 16 November 1944 when the Japanese evacuation from New Guinea had been completed.
The Philippines campaign.
The Leyte campaign begins.
"Willoughby" was part of the burgeoning force of PT boats and their tenders that had grown as the World War II in the Southwest Pacific had progressed. So significant had been the role of PT boats in the island-hopping campaigns that they were slated to take part in supporting the initial landings in the Philippine Islands. Moving the motor torpedo boats from New Guinea to the Philippines, however, presented a problem.
Commander Selman S. Bowling, commanding Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron (MTBRon) 21, considered the voyage too long to be made "in one hop, even if escorted by tenders." The margin of safety for the ships to operate with, once they arrived in the objective area after the long voyage, was deemed unacceptable. Fuel was critical.
Ultimately, the decision was made to route the boats via the recently secured Palau Islands, sending them along with their tenders. "Willoughby" made up part of this significant movement—described as "the largest and longest mass movement of PT's under their own power during the war"—that began on 13 October 1944, at Mios Woendi.
On that day, "Willoughby", in company with motor torpedo boat tenders USS "Oyster Bay" (AGP-6) (Commander Bowling's flagship) and USS "Wachapreague" (AGP-8), seaplane tender USS "Half Moon" (AVP-26), two United States Army craft, and 45 PT boats, sailed for the Palaus on the first leg of their monumental voyage of 1,200 nautical miles (2,222 kilometers). At Kossol Roads, the PT boats fueled from the tenders, while the tenders in turn fueled from accompanying oilers. On the second leg of the trip, the PT boats fueled at sea from the tenders, a difficult task but a necessary one if the PT boats were to arrive off Leyte with their fuel tanks full and ready to go.
The PT boats arrived at Leyte Gulf on the morning of 20 October 1944, the first day of the landings on the western beaches of Leyte proper, and commenced patrols that evening. "Willoughby" steamed to San Pedro Bay, off Leyte, arriving there at 1443 hours on 21 October 1944, and tended the PT boats of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons (MTBRons) 7 and 21 over the ensuing weeks.
On 23 October 1944, "Willoughby" took on board a man from USS "PT-325" who had been wounded by shrapnel during Japanese air attacks that day. On 24 October 1944, heavy Japanese air attacks upon the American invasion forces commenced at 0750 hours; American combat air patrol (CAP) fighters shot down four Japanese twin-engined Mitsubishi G4M "Betty" bombers, one of them attempting a suicide dive into a transport. A few moments later, a formation of "Sally" light bombers came into the area, and a heavy antiaircraft barrage claimed three of them. CAP fighters and antiaircraft fire combined to down most of another mixed group of Japanese planes —- Kawasaki Ki-45 "Nicks," Aichi D3A "Vals," and a Mitsubishi Ki-46 "Dinah" that attacked subsequently.
"Willoughby" gunners claimed two planes downed—this was reduced to one the next day—and one of the planes she damaged crashed into and sank a nearby landing craft infantry (LCI). "Willoughby" brought on board five of the LCI's survivors and saw a "kamikaze" crash into the ocean-going tug USS "Sonoma" (ATO-12). During the day, "Willoughby" stood at general quarters at one point for a stretch of six and one-half hours.
Japanese air attacks enlivened the next day, 25 October 1944, as well. During that 24-hour span, "Willoughby" was at general quarters for 11 and one-half hours. She also shot down one Japanese plane.
The Battle of Leyte Gulf.
Meanwhile, major Japanese naval forces were approaching the Philippines from three directions. The Japanese southern force was heading through the Sulu Sea in the direction of Surigao Strait, their central force was crossing the Sibuyan Sea toward the San Bernardino Strait, and a northern force of Japanese aircraft carriers was north of Luzon, hoping to lure the American Fast Carrier Task Force away from Leyte Gulf.
For the first time since the 1942 fighting off Guadalcanal, the opposing sides arrayed battleships against one another. Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf deployed his forces across the northern end of Surigao Strait. Thirty-nine of the 45 PT boats that had come from Mios Woendi and made the long voyage via the Palaus deployed in sections of three boats each, strung out through the straits and along the coasts of Mindanao, Leyte, and Bohol, into the Mindanao Sea, to detect and report on the enemy's approach.
In the Battle of Surigao Strait that followed, the PT boats played a significant role. "The skill, determination, and courage displayed by the personnel of these small boats is worthy of the highest praise," reported Admiral Chester W. Nimitz subsequently. "Their contact reports," he continued, "as well as the firing and illumination they drew from the enemy, gave ample warning to our own main body; and, while the issue of the later main engagement was never in doubt, the PT's action very probably threw the Japanese command off balance and contributed to the completeness of their subsequent defeat."
All boats attached to "Willoughby" participated in that important encounter, while the tender herself remained at San Pedro Bay. The battle was just one part of the larger Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23 October 1944-26 October 1944, in which the Imperial Japanese Navy suffered a crushing defeat.
The Leyte campaign concludes.
In ensuing days, "Willoughby" experienced Japanese air attacks at odd intervals during daylight hours. On the morning of 27 October 1944, one of her boats came under attack by Japanese planes, when a Mitsubishi A6M Zero (or "Zeke") dropped a fragmentation bomb off the bow of USS "PT-152". Two men died and eight were wounded; the boat subsequently pulled next to "Willoughby" and transferred the dead and wounded to the tender.
Also while at San Pedro Bay, "Willoughby" experienced a storm of typhoon intensity on 30 October 1944. During that spell of heavy weather, the storm carried away one of the ship's motor launches, but it was later recovered. The ship herself suffered no damage.
From 31 October 1944 to 12 November 1944, "Willoughby" experienced daily air raids. On 5 November 1944, Japanese planes scored a direct hit on USS "PT-320", moored off the tender's starboard bow, demolishing the boat and killing nearly the entire crew; only one man survived. A week later, on 12 November 1944, a flight of suicide aircraft attacked; while "Willoughby" herself was not touched, she witnessed "kamikaze"s crash into landing craft repair ships USS "Egeria" (ARL-8) and USS "Achilles" (ARL-41).
"Willoughby" and her sister ship "Wachapreague" retired from Leyte on 13 November 1944 and arrived at Mios Woendi on 16 November. On 17 and 18 November 1944, the motor torpedo boat tenders loaded stores and supplies. Later, in company with motor torpedo boat tender USS "Pontus" (AGP-20), "Wachapreague", seven Army crash boats and 41 PT boats, "Willoughby" departed New Guinea and proceeded vai Kossol Roads back to the Philippines, in a repeat performance of the previous mass movement of PT boats from New Guinea to that strategic archipelago. After servicing the PT boats en route, at Kossol Roads, on 23 November 1944, Willoughby steamed into Leyte Gulf, arriving late on 27 November 1944.
The tender manned her general quarters stations when a large American task force nearby —- composed of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers — underwent a Japanese air attack. Shells from friendly ships fell "perilously near" "Willoughby", but she emerged unscathed as the force repulsed the Japanese raid.
The Luzon campaign.
Shifting to Espiritu Santo soon thereafter, "Willoughby" picked up necessary spare parts vital to the continued operation of PT boats in the Philippine Islands on 4 January 1945 and departed for the Treasury Islands on 5 January 1945, where she picked up more spare parts after her arrival on 8 January 1945. She continued loading operations at Green Island, Emirau Island, and Manus before returning to the Philippines, anchoring in San Juanico Strait on 18 January 1945.
Over the next three days, "Willoughby" unloaded the vital spares that had been gathered on the recently completed voyage. She then steamed to Mangarin Bay, off Mindoro Island, towing a fuel barge and a small pontoon drydock, and in company with 25 Army tugs escorted by two destroyer escorts, and arrived there on 31 January 1945. En route, on 27 January 1945, she spotted a Japanese plane, but it did not attack the convoy.
"Willoughby" was at Mindoro only briefly. Underway soon thereafter, she took the "kamikaze"-damaged destroyer USS "Gansevoort" (DD-608) in tow. Since no other vessels were available to tow the crippled destroyer, "Willoughby" drew that special duty and pulled the ship to San Pedro Bay, arriving on 5 February 1945. "Willoughby" then resumed tending PT boats at San Pedro Bay on 6 February 1945.
"Willoughby", carrying the personnel of MTBRons 20 and 30, departed Leyte on 19 February 1945 in a Mindoro-bound convoy with 25 landing ships tank (LSTs), 15 landing ships medium (LSMs), nine LCIs, seven motor minesweepers (YMS), a patrol craft (PC), a small coastal transport (APC), and three submarine chasers (SC). On the morning of 21 February 1945, the Japanese submarine "RO-43" torpedoed destroyer USS "Renshaw" (DD-499), one of the convoy's escorts. The torpedo struck the destroyer's forward fire room, leaving her dead in the water. Destroyer USS "Shaw" (DD-373) stayed behind to protect the crippled "Renshaw" while the convoy proceeded. Ultimately, a tug, dispatched from Leyte, brought the crippled "Renshaw" into port.
The Palawan campaign.
"Willoughby" meanwhile arrived at Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, on 23 February 1945 to prepare for the imminent invasion of Palawan, in the southern Philippine Islands. On 27 February 1945, "Willoughby" weighed anchor and set out for Palawan with a convoy of 19 LST's and 21 PT boats, escorted by four destroyers. On 28 February 1945, units of the 8th Army went ashore on Palawan, the westernmost major island in the Philippine archipelago. On 1 March 1945, "Willoughby" and her charges from MTBRons 20 and 23 arrived off Palawan at Puerto Princesa and began operations. The invading troops of the 8th Army found little opposition awaiting them ashore, and the PT's, patrolling the length of the island, found no Japanese forces afloat.
Off the southern tip of Palawan, however, the PT boats found a small Japanese garrison on the island of Pandanan. The boats repeatedly strafed the Japanese positions, encountering a volume of fire that was initially heavy but that later slackened and finally disappeared. Late in April 1945, a landing party went ashore and found that the Japanese had evacuated. Thus, at the end of April 1945, the PT boats ceased patrols off Palawan.
The Borneo campaign.
Relieved by motor torpedo boat tender USS "Mobjack" (AGP-7) at Puerto Princessa on 30 April 1945, "Willoughby" weighed anchor and sailed for Samar, arriving at PT Base 17 on 2 May 1945. She spent the next eight days steaming to various points in Leyte Gulf, taking on stores in preparation for the expected invasion of Brunei Bay in British North Borneo.
"Willoughby" returned to Mangarin Bay in company with five merchant ships and two destroyer escorts and then spent the period from 13 May 1945 to 4 June 1945 off Mindoro, tending MTBRons 13 and 16, preparing for the North Borneo operation to come. The tender got underway on 5 June 1945 and on 6 June 1945 arrived at Puerto Princessa, where the PT boats refueled and underwent minor repairs.
"Willoughby" weighed anchor on 7 June 1945 and headed for Brunei Bay, rendezvousing in Balabac Strait on 8 June 1945 with the Brunei assault force, and continued in company with those warships for the remainder of the voyage toward her objective. Meanwhile, on 9 June 1945, four of her PT boats -- USS "PT-78", USS "PT-81", USS "PT-82", and USS "PT-84"—patrolled the invasion area.
On 10 June 1945, the Australian 9th Division moved ashore at Brunei Bay and pushed inland. "Willoughby" arrived at Brunei Bay that day and went to general quarters at 0615 hours in preparation for the assault phase of the strikes on Labuan Island, Muara Island, and Polompong Point. Shortly thereafter, a lone Japanese plane attacked the formation to which "Willoughby" was attached and dropped two bombs which splashed into the water without causing any damage.
"Willoughby" tended MTBRons 13 and 16 in Brunei Bay until August 1945. Early in June, the ship experienced several air raid alerts, and three enemy planes actually entered the area on 14 June 1945. In the meantime, ashore, the Australians were encountering heavy resistance from the Japanese on Labuan Island. The PT boats supporting the campaign destroyed a 60-foot (18.25 m) sailing vessel and six barges during the first phase of the landings and then ran out of targets afloat. They then machine-gunned and mortared Japanese positions, and at times conducted joint strikes with Royal Australian Air Force planes at Jesselton, Miri, and Kudat, three Japanese-held oil centers on North Borneo.
During her time at Brunei Bay, "Willoughby" shifted her anchorage on 10 July 1945, moving to a spot off Muara Island, the site of the newly established PT boat base. She remained there for the rest of the war. She lay at Muara Island on 15 August 1945 when word reached her that the Japanese had decided to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. Simultaneously, offensive operations by MTBRons 13 and 16 ceased.
"Willoughby" earned three battle stars for her World War II service
Post-World War II Navy career.
On 24 August 1945, "Willoughby" got underway for Mindanao to take on a cargo of diesel fuel and arrived at Zamboanga on 26 August 1945. During her passage, she sighted a Japanese horned-type naval mine and destroyed it with gunfire. "Willoughby" returned to Muara Island at the end of August 1945, encountering en route on 28 August 1945 and sinking another stray Japanese naval mine.
From 30 August 1945 to 8 September 1945, "Willoughby" tended PT boats off Muara Island before she embarked 38 officers and 318 enlisted men of the Australian 9th Division and loaded 50 tons of supplies on 9 September 1945, at nearby Labuan Island. She got underway on 10 September 1945, bound for Tanjong Po, off the mouth of the Sarawak River. En route, she rendezvoused with six PT boats, which she accompanied for the rest of the passage.
Making arrival on 11 September 1945, 180 troops disembarked from "Willoughby" and went on board five of the PT boats. The sixth PT boat embarked Captain W. C. Jennings, Commander J. P. Engle, USNR, and Lieutenant Commander A. W. Fargo, USNR, three American naval officers who had been invited to attend the surrender of Japanese forces in North Borneo. Soon, the six PT boats and the Australian corvette HMAS "Kapunda" headed upriver.
Although the surrender ceremonies had been set for 1400 hours on board "Kapunda", the Japanese commander, Major-General Hiyoe Yamamura, reported that he was indisposed to attend. Ordered to show up, however, Yamamura arrived at 1500 hours. The surrender was signed, and the Japanese left "Kapunda", at 1600 hours. The six PT boats then proceeded on to Kuching on the Sarawak River and put ashore the first Australian occupation troops.
The next morning, 12 September 1945, "Willoughby" disembarked the remaining Australian troops to the PT boats and unloaded the 50 tons of stores into two Landing craft tank (LCTs) brought to Tanjong Po for that purpose. On 13 September 1945, 210 former Allied prisoners of war and internees kept at Batu Lintang camp near Kuching embarked in "Willoughby". Among the men transferred were two American POWs, enlisted men who had been captured by the Japanese after their ship, the heavy cruiser USS "Houston" (CA-30, had been sunk in Sunda Strait on 1 March 1942 during the Battle of Sunda Strait. Several stretcher cases went on board the Australian hospital ship "Manunda", anchored off Tanjong Po.
Underway on the afternoon of 13 September 1945, "Willoughby" and her PT boats headed for Labuan Island and, upon her arrival there on the evening of 14 September 1945, discharged all evacuees. "Willoughby" subsequently made two additional voyages to Kuching, each time transporting Australian troops and relief supplies on the inbound passage and taking out former prisoners of war and internees on the return trip. She made her last visit to Tanjong Po on 23 September 1945, returning to Brunei Bay and anchoring at her usual berth off Muara Island late on 24 September 1945.

Oakleigh Thorne

W.O.S. Thorne, more generally known as Oakleigh Thorne (July 31, 1866-May 23-1948), was a publisher of tax guides who also served as a director of Wells Fargo & Company from 1902 to 1918.
Thorne was born in 1866 in New Hamburg, New York, the son of Edward Thomas Thorne and Charlotte (Pearsall) Thorne. He was educated in the schools of Poughkeepsie, New York. On February 26, 1889, he married Helen T. Stafford. The couple made their home in Millbrook, New York, which remains the family's principal place of residence.
In 1892 he purchased a small printing company that under his management became Commerce Clearing House, a major publisher of tax guides for lawyers and accountants.
Thorne was elected a director of Wells Fargo & Company on January 2, 1902. This was at the time control of the express company passed to E.H. Harriman; the company headquarters moved from San Francisco to New York City in 1904. Thorne remained a director of Wells Fargo until the company ceased express service in 1918.
Expanding into the realm of railroad speculation, Thorne and his partner Marsden J. Perry bought up a controlling interest in the failing New York, Westchester and Boston Railway in 1906. Combined with the assets of the competing New York & Portchester Railroad, the Millbrook Company was created as a holding entity that was transferred to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad following the Panic of 1907.
Thorne was president of Trust Company of America when its main office on Wall Street was the target of a bank run starting on Wednesday, October 23, 1907, during the Panic of 1907. It survived, with the backing of J. Pierpont Morgan and an infusion of gold from the Bank of England and other European sources.
In addition to his connection with Commerce Clearing House, Wells Fargo, and Trust Company of America, Thorne was a director of the Corporation Trust Company and of the Bank of Millbrook.
Oakleigh Thorne died on May 23, 1948. He should not be confused with his great-grandson, also named Oakleigh Thorne, who sold Commerce Clearing House to the Dutch media firm of Wolters Kluwer in 1996. He was listed on Forbes' 2008 list of the world's billionaires as #1014 with a net worth of $1.1 billion. The family's holdings are now managed by his son, Oakleigh Thorne IV, who has been chief executive officer of eCollege.com since May 2000.

Aldridge School

Aldridge School is a mixed secondary school and sixth form with academy status located in Aldridge, in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall in the West Midlands, England. The other secondary school in Aldridge is St Francis of Assisi Catholic Technology College. Although not officially recognised as such, it has the unofficial status of a Specialist Music College, as the school does offer a music scholarship to around 20 students per year. The school is also recognised as a Science College. The current headmaster is Mr David Mountney.
History.
The school was formed by the merger in 1975 of Aldridge Grammar School and Tynings County Secondary Modern School, which were co-located on the same campus.
Aldridge Grammar School opened in September 1959 and was an 11-18 selective school. The Headmaster until his retirement in 1974 was E I E (Eric Ioan Emlyn) Whitman, BSc (1909-1990) who had previously played first class cricket for Glamorgan in 1932.
Aldridge School adopted its current name when the merger took place in September 1975. 
In September 2003, Aldridge School became a Science College. Since then, it has invested heavily in science equipment for each subject, as well as a Biology block. The school boasts 15 laboratories with prep rooms and technical support, available for all three of the sciences.
House system.
When a pupil joins the school, they are placed in a tutor group which is assigned to one of the four houses - Barr, Daniels, Linley and Scott - each of which houses around 360 pupils. Each academic year, through a series of inter-house events, mainly sports (e.g. football and cricket), each house may earn points depending on their respective positions in the event (1st place = 4 points, descending so that 4th place = 1 point).
Music Scholarship.
Aldridge School offers a music scholarship for prospective students who wish to join the school in Year 7. To be eligible, one must play an instrument and undertake a selection process, completing two parts, namely the instrumental audition where one plays two pieces of their own choice and the theory part, similar to a normal music theory paper. Unlike normal selection where one must fall within a 3-mile radius of the school's location to apply, the scholarship process allows anyone to apply, with students coming from as far as Great Barr, West Bromwich and other places around the Birmingham/Staffordshire area. Aldridge has one of the largest state school music departments in the country, with over 50 pupils studying music at A-level.

<doc id="19847759" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19847759" title="Jan-Fishan Khan">
Jan-Fishan Khan

Jan-Fishan Khan, born Sayyid Muhammed Shah, was a 19th-century Afghan warlord who participated in the First Anglo-Afghan War and the subsequent Indian Rebellion of 1857.
Jan-Fishan Khan was the son of an , Sayyid Qutubuddin Khan, of Paghman, the family's ancestral home in Afghanistan. His family has historically claimed descent from Ali ar-Ridha, the eighth Imam.
Life.
In the First Anglo-Afghan War, Sayyid Muhammed Shah, also known to the British as the "Laird of Pughman", supported Shah Shuja and the British Army against other Afghan forces, apparently in order to honour a family allegiance to Shah Shuja. In 1840, he was awarded the title "Jan-Fishan Khan" by Shah Shuja for his support. According to writer James Moore, the title means "The Zealot" (however this is a misunderstanding of the meaning of the Persian idiom which can mean "zealous" in the sense of ‘ready to sacrifice one's life’, as it is defined in Steingass). One of Jan-Fishan Khan's descendants Saira Shah has correctly explained that this "nom de guerre" translates literally as "scatterer of souls". Shah recounts that the appellation has a double meaning: first, that of a warlord scattering the souls of his enemies, and second, one based on a Sufi couplet describing the supplicant's devotion to God:
Having accompanied Sir Robert Sale’s force on its march from Kabul to Jalalabad, Jan-Fishan Khan was honourably mentioned in despatches for his assistance. In the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Jan-Fishan Khan again helped the British to quell the mutiny. Lethbridge (1893) gives the following summary in "The Golden Book of India", a genealogical and biographical source: 
Exiled from Kabul ever since the British retreat from Afghanistan, Jan-Fishan Khan eventually came to settle in Sardhana, a town near Meerut in the North-Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, and was given the hereditary title of nawab in recognition of his services. He had lost several of his sons in the fighting.
The Sardhana estate.
According to the "Imperial Gazetteer of India" (1908): On account of services rendered to Sir Alexander Burnes in his Kabul mission, and subsequently to the British in the retreat from Kabul, a pension of Rs. 1,000 a month was given to the family, which settled at Sardhana. As a reward for subsequent help to the British in the Indian mutiny, the title of Nawab Bahadur, and confiscated estates assessed at Rs. 10,000 per annum, were conferred on Jan Fishan Khan, with concessions as to the revenue assessed. The pension was also made permanent. During the lifetime of the first Nawab, and for some time after, the family added largely to the estate, but speculations in indigo and personal extravagance caused losses. The estate was taken under the Court of Wards in 1895, and in 1901 the debts, amounting to 10 lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000 Rupees), were paid off by a loan from Government.
Tradition has it that the town of Sardhana (population 12,059 in 1891, growing to 12,467 in 1901 and 47,970 by 2001) was founded by a Raja Sarkat, whose family ruled there until their expulsion by the Muslims. Sardhana was once famous as the residence of the Catholic ruler Begum Samru.
Sufi connection.
According to his descendant Idries Shah's obituary, as well as being an Afghan warlord, Jan-Fishan Khan was also a Sufi sage.
Statements attributed to Jan-Fishan Khan by Idries Shah in his books on Sufism include: "The candle is not there to illuminate itself", "You may follow one stream. Realize that it leads to the Ocean. Do not mistake the stream for the Ocean" and "The visible places of Sufi study are like lamps in the dark. The inner places are like the Sun in the sky. The lamp illuminates an area for a time. The sun abolishes the dark". Khan also features in several teaching stories and some didactic passages in these books.
Descendants.
After Jan-Fishan Khan's death in 1864, his three sons succeeded him as Nawab, the last being Saiyid Ahmad Shah, who succeeded in 1882.
Jan-Fishan Khan has a number of notable descendants, including his great-grandson, the author and diplomat the Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah who married the author and traveller Saira Elizabeth Luiza Shah; great-great-grandchildren: the authors and Sufi teachers Idries Shah and Omar Ali-Shah and the storyteller Amina Shah; and great-great-great-grandchildren: the author and filmmaker Tahir Shah; the author, reporter and documentary filmmaker Saira Shah, and Safia Nafisa Shah, Tahir's twin sister, who edited the book "Afghan Caravan." Omar Ali-Shah's son, Arif Ali-Shah is a filmmaker and has led Sufi study groups.
Other famous descendants in India, Pakistan and Canada include the former Indian Deputy Chief of Army Staff Zameerud-din Shah, acclaimed actors Naseeruddin Shah and Syed Kamal (Syed Bilaluddin Shah), as well as the Pakistani-born English cricketer Owais Shah.Canadian Realtor ((Agha Sarwat Ali Shah)) who is married to Mobeen Zehra Shah ((Suhaila))and have two sons, ((Sifat Ali Shah))and ((Samat Ali Shah))

United Centre

United Centre () is a Ukrainian political party. It is an offspring of Our Ukraine. Legally United Centre is the successor of the Party of Private Property (; "Partija Privatnoi Vlasnosti"), registered with the Ministry of Justice on September 24, 1999. The party changed its name to United Centre in March 2008.
The party won 3 seats in the Ukrainian parliament in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election; but in February 2013 its member Pavlo Baloha was deprived of his deputy seats by the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine because it had established that the election results in the single-member districts in which he was elected had been "unreliable".
History.
Party of Private Property.
The Party of Private Property was registered with the Ministry of Justice September 24, 1999. At the 1999 Ukrainian presidential election the party endorsed incumbent President Leonid Kuchma.
During the Ukrainian parliamentary elections 2002 it was part of the electoral alliance Team of Winter Generation. Team of Winter Generation won 2.0% of the popular vote and no seats.
Party of Private Property did not participate in the Ukrainian parliamentary elections of 2006 and 2007.
The merger of United Centre with the Democratic Party of Ukraine failed to materialize prior to the first ever congress of United Centre.
United Centre.
Viktor Yushchenko Presidency (2008-2009).
In February 2008 several prominent members left Our Ukraine. Viktor Baloha, Head of the President's Secretariat resigned on February 15 (to lift the issue of the correlation between the authorities as the President's Chief of Staff and as a member of the OU-PSD presidium). Roman Bezsmertny, high ranked party official, along with people's deputies, Mykhaylo Polyanchych, Ihor Kryl, Viktor Topolov, Oksana Bilozir and Vasyl Petevka resigned on February 20, in a joint statement the declared that: "some of the leaders of the party play their own game, coming from personal interests and it has nothing to do with responsibility, pluralism and norms of democracy."
At the sixth Party Congress of the Party of Private Property, held on 20 March 2008, the party decided to change its name too United Centre. At this time the parties goals where: "assisting President Viktor Yushchenko to realize its program of actions" and "to unite Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine".
On March 27, United Centre held the founding meeting in Kiev. On July 8, Presidential Secretariat's Chief Baloha entered the United Centre party. On July 12, 2008 United Centre re-elected Verkhovna Rada deputy Ihor Kril of Our Ukraine - People's Self-Defense bloc as its leader. The merger of United Center with the Democratic Party of Ukraine failed to materialize prior to the congress. Administrative pressure by governors upon state employees to sign up to United Centre is said to be ongoing. Our Ukraine-People's Self-Defence Bloc did complain that members of its regional branches are being poached by United Centre.
In October 2008 Social Christian Party merged with United Centre.
On October 21, 2008 the presidium of People's Union Our Ukraine decided not to team up with any other party then the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc for the 2008 snap parliamentary poll and called the idea of teaming up with United Centre "impossible". On 20 November 2008, the United Centre leader Ihor Kril said the party will participate independently in the next parliamentary elections and that he "fully support the view that the format of Our Ukraine-People's Self-Defense Bloc, as it exists now, is not realistic or effective. Every political force should take responsibility for their actions before the electorate". 
According to UNIAN, the People's Union Our Ukraine and United Centre parties was to carry out a unifying congress on January 17, 2009. The People's Democratic party was reported to join the move. However nothing like this happened.
After Viktor Baloha resigned as Head of the Secretariat of the President of Ukraine he claimed he resigned from this post as he is totally against President Yushchenko's decision to run for president for a second term, the second reason behind his resignation was nepotism. "I'm confident that you have no moral right to participate in the presidential elections. I'm not your supporter here," Baloha said in a statement made available from the United Centre party's press service to Interfax-Ukraine on May 19, 2009.
Viktor Yanukovych Presidency (since 2010).
The party did not join the parliamentary coalition which supported the Azarov Government in March 2010 because the Communist Party of Ukraine was a part of that coalition.
A March 2010 poll predicted that the party would get 0.2% of the vote at the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election.)
Early August parliamentarian Kyrylo Kulykov joined the party, thus as of August 2010 6 United Centre members are lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada. Kulykov had switched from Yuriy Lutsenko's People's Self-Defense. This was 9 too short to form a United Centre faction in the Verkhovna Rada.
In the 2010 local elections the party won a few representative in regional parliaments but achieved a stunning victory in the Zakarpattia Oblast.
On November 12, 2010 President Viktor Yanukovych appointed party leader Viktor Baloha Minister of Emergencies and Minister of the Protection of the Population from the Chernobyl disaster . According to Baloha this did not mean his party would join the coalition Government. According to Ukrayinska Pravda the United Centre deputies in parliament already quietly voted with the Party of Regions (the main component of the Azarov Government). Deputy Lesya Orobets left the party after Baloha's appointment because the party never informed her about it.
According to Ukrainian media Strong Ukraine party leader Serhiy Tyhypko personally prevented an merger of United Centre with Party of Regions in March 2012.
The party did not take part in the October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election nationwide proportional party-list system; instead nine members of the party tried to win a seat in nine of the 225 local single-member districts. The party won 3 constituencies (all in Zakarpattia) and thus parliamentary representation. These seats where won by Viktor Baloha, Vasyl Petiovka and Pavlo Baloha. Pavlo Baloha joined the faction of Party of Regions in December 2012, while Viktor Baloha and Petiovka did not join any faction. Pavlo Baloha left the Party of Regions faction mid-April 2012 to became an unaffiliated lawmaker too.
Pavlo Baloha was deprived of his deputy seats on 8 February 2013 by the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine because it had established that the election results in the single-member districts in which he was elected (single-member districts number 71 in Zakarpattia Oblast) had been "unreliable". On 7 July 2013 Pavlo Baloha's mandate was officially cancelled.
Stances.
The party rejects any possibility of joining a parliamentary coalition with the Communist Party of Ukraine.

Witherwack

Witherwack is a suburb in the north of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England, situated between Red House to the west, Carley Hill to the east and Marley Pots to the south.
The area is an overspill council estate, usually regarded as part of "Greater Southwick", and was built in the 1960s. In common with most estates in Sunderland, the street names all start with the same letter - 'W' in the case of Witherwack. 
The whole of the estate falls within the SR5 postal code and is represented by three Labour councillors as part of the Southwick ward on Sunderland City Council.
Fulwell Quarry Nature Reserve.
Fulwell Quarry, known locally as Witherwack Quarry, is a Local Nature Reserve located in the disused quarries at Fulwell. It is bounded by Witherwack to the west, Carley Hill to the south, Newcastle Road to the east and the South Tyneside county border to the north. Road access is via Newcastle Road only; however, the site is also accessible by foot from the neighbouring suburbs of Witherwack and Carley Hill. Public transport is available on Go North East services 9, 35/A/B/C, 99 and X3.
The nature reserve is of national importance due its rare Magnesian Limestone geology. The wildflower meadows and grasslands are the favourable habitats for many butterflies, such as the Large Skipper, the Small Skipper and the Dingy Skipper. Plants include "Fragaria vesca" (Wild Strawberry) and "Blackstonia perfoliata" (Yellow-wort). Looking to the north and east, there are good views of the Cleadon Hills and the North Sea coast.
Transport.
Witherwack does not have its own Tyne and Wear Metro station. However, nearby Stadium of Light Metro station on Newcastle Road, and Seaburn Metro station on Station Road, are both within easy reach from Witherwack by bus services 7 and 99 respectively. 
There is a park and ride facility near Witherwack based at Stadium of Light Metro station. There are 182 free car parking spaces available. Witherwack is located less than a mile north of the Queen Alexandra Bridge, giving good road links into Sunderland City Centre. Witherwack is located close to the A1231 for road links to Washington, Tyne and Wear, which in turn feeds into the A1. Witherwack, via the A1231, is close to the A19; north to the Tyne Tunnel and North Tyneside, or south to Peterlee and Teesside.
Witherwack has been built around a purpose built bus terminus, which is situated at the eastern end of Wiltshire Road.

Michael Wolff (journalist)

Michael Wolff (born August 27, 1953) is an American author, essayist, and journalist. He currently writes a regular column for "Vanity Fair" magazine. His most recent book, "The Man Who Owns the News" (2008), is a biography of Rupert Murdoch, based on more than 50 hours of interviews with the media mogul. 
Early life.
Michael Wolff was born in Paterson, New Jersey, the son of Lewis A. Wolff, an advertising man, and Marguerite V. Wolff, a newspaper reporter. He went to Columbia College of Columbia University in New York City. While a student at Columbia, he worked for the "New York Times" as a copy boy. 
He published his first magazine article in the "New York Times Magazine" in 1974: a profile of Angela Atwood, a neighbor of his family. As a member of the Symbionese Liberation Army, she helped kidnap Patricia Hearst. Shortly after this, he left the "Times" and became a contributing writer to the "New Times", a bi-weekly news magazine started by John Larsen and George Hirsch. Wolff's first book was "White Kids" (1979), a collection of essays.
Career.
After publishing his first book, Wolff received an advance to write a novel, which he never finished. A college friend, Steven J. Hueglin, who had become a successful Wall Street banker, asked for Wolff's help in evaluating investments in media companies. He pulled him into a career as a media business entrepreneur. 
In 1988, Wolff took over the management of the magazine "Campaigns & Elections". He became involved in advising start-up magazines, including "Wired." He also raised financing for media companies and new businesses. 
In 1991, he launched Michael Wolff & Company, Inc., specializing in book-packaging. Its first project, "Where We Stand", was a book with a companion PBS series. The company's next major project was creating one of the first guides to the Internet, albeit in book form. "Net Guide" was published by Random House. On the eve of launching the title as a monthly magazine, the incipient magazine was bought by CMP Media, the publisher of computer magazines. 
Wolff's company continued to publish a succession of book-form Internet guides. In 1995, the company took a round of venture capital investment, with shareholders including Patricof & Co., the New York venture capital firm. It began to convert its print directories into a website and digital directory called Your Personal Network. At one point, the company was valued by bankers seeking to take the company public at more than $100 million. The venture collapsed in 1997, and Wolff was expelled from the company.
Return to writing.
Wolff returned to writing, from which he had been absent for more than ten years, and recounted the details of the financing, positioning, personalities, and ultimate breakdown of a start-up Internet company. The book, "Burn Rate", became a bestseller. Wolff briefly worked as a weekly columnist for "The Industry Standard", an Internet trade magazine published by IDG. 
In August 1998, he was recruited by "New York magazine" to write a weekly column. Over the next six years, he wrote more than 300 columns, solidifying his reputation as provocative and knowledgeable writer about the media industry. The entrepreneur Steven Brill, the media banker Steven Rattner, and the book publisher Judith Regan, were criticized by him.
Wolff has been nominated for the National Magazine Award three times, winning twice. His second National Magazine Award was for a series of columns he wrote from the media center in the Persian Gulf as the Iraq War started in 2003. His book, "Autumn of the Moguls" (2004), which predicted the mainstream media crisis that hit later in the decade, was based on many of his "New York" magazine columns.
In 2004, when "New York" magazine's owners, Primedia, Inc., put the title up for sale, Wolff helped assembled a group of investors, including "New York Daily News" publisher Mortimer Zuckerman, to back him in acquiring the magazine. Although the group believed it had made a successful bid, Primedia decided to sell the magazine to the investment banker Bruce Wasserstein.
In 2005, Wolff joined "Vanity Fair" as its media columnist. In 2007, with Patrick Spain, the founder of "Hoover's", and Caroline Miller, the former editor-in-chief of "New York" magazine, he launched "Newser," a news curator. 
That year, he also wrote a biography of Rupert Murdoch, "The Man Who Owns the News", based on more than 50 hours of conversation with Murdoch, and extensive access to his business associates and his family. The book was published in 2008. That year he also began writing a daily column for Newser.
In 2010, Wolff became editor of "Adweek". He lasted in the job barely a year before stepping down. 
Criticism.
In its review of Wolff's book "Burn Rate", "Brill's Content" criticized Wolff for "apparent factual errors" and said that more than a dozen of the subjects he mentioned complained that Wolff had "invented or changed quotes" that he attributed to them. 
In a 2004 cover story for "The New Republic", Michelle Cottle wrote that Wolff was "uninterested in the working press," preferring to focus on "the power players—the moguls" and was "fixated on culture, style, buzz, and money, money, money." She also noted that "the scenes in his columns aren’t recreated so much as created—springing from Wolff’s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events." Calling his writing "a whirlwind of flourishes and tangents and asides that often stray so far from the central point that you begin to wonder whether there is a central point", she quoted one daily New York columnist as saying "I find it nearly impossible to read his columns. They’re flabby. I don’t know what the fuck he’s trying to say." One journalist who knew Wolff told Cottle, "He can't write. He doesn't report." Cottle subsequently called Wolff "possibly the bitchiest media big foot writing today."
The "Columbia Journalism Review" criticized Wolff in 2010 when he suggested that "The New York Times" was aggressively covering the breaking News International phone hacking scandal as a way of attacking News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch. "CJR" called Wolff's analysis "pathetic", "disgusting", "twisted", and based on "zero evidence".
In 2013, Gawker.com cited Wolff as a major example of "trolling", whereby media run stories designed solely for the purpose of outraging their consumers and thereby provoking public reaction. Gawker wrote, "Wolff is intelligent enough to be an actual, serious media critic; he's also canny enough to know that few people give a shit about serious media criticism, so he can get a lot more readers by tossing off ridiculous white wines ["sic"] about restaurant reservations and incendiary mansplanations; and, he's both needy and amoral enough to just, you know, insult people for attention."
"New York Magazine" has called him an "angry man for pay" and a "media provocateur". 
Personal life.
In 1981, Wolff married Alison Anthoine, an attorney. They have three children and are currently separated.

<doc id="19848028" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19848028" title="Henry Killigrew (diplomat)">
Henry Killigrew (diplomat)

Sir Henry Killigrew (c. 1528 – 1603) was an English diplomat and ambassador in the sixteenth century. He was several times employed by Elizabeth I in Scottish affairs and served as one of the English appointees to the Council of State of the Netherlands in the United Provinces in 1586 and 1587-1589. Member of Parliament for Newport & Launceston in 1553, Saltash in 1563, Truro in 1571-2.
Career.
He was the fourth son of John Killigrew of Arwenack, of an old Cornish family, by Elizabeth, second daughter of James Trewenard of Trewenard. He was probably educated at Cambridge, but there is no definite information on the point. Killigrew served as a gentleman in the household of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, and became a lifelong follower of the Dudleys. On 18 February 1553 he was returned member of parliament for Newport-juxta-Launceston. He assisted Sir Peter Carew in escaping to the continent in January 1554, and during the remainder of Queen Mary of England's reign appears to have been in exile. Killigrew was at Paris in July 1556, when he was described by the English authorities as a rebel. From a French base, he and his brother Peter engaged in piracy. In August 1557, Henry was present at the Battle of St. Quentin, where Sir James Melville stated of him that "Harry Killygrew, an Englis gentilman, my auld friend," held his horse while he got his wound dressed after his escape. Killigrew was recalled to England on the accession of Elizabeth, and she employed him on various diplomatic missions, including one to Germany in connection with negotiations for a defensive league. In July 1559 he went for a short time to assist Nicholas Throckmorton in France.
Killigrew counted both Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester and William Cecil, Lord Burghley as his patrons. He wrote to Dudley in 1562, regarding their Prostestant policies: "In these cases I take you to be as one". In July 1562 he led a military contingent at Rouen, as part of the Newhaven expedition. In June 1566 he was sent on a mission from Elizabeth to Mary, Queen of Scots, for the 'declaration of sundry things necessary to be reformed between them for the preservation of their amity'. He returned in the following July, and after the murder of Darnley was again sent to Scotland with a special message to the Queen of Scots, which he delivered to her 'in a dark chamber.'
On 20 April 1572 he was elected M.P. for Truro. In September, shortly after the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, he was again sent to Scotland, in connection with the negotiations for the surrender of the Queen of Scots to the Protestant lords, who would then immediately execute her. This was a scheme so secret that, apart from Killigrew, only Queen Elizabeth, Cecil and Leicester were privy to it on the English part. Due to the Earl of Mar's sudden death, nothing came of it. Killigrew ultimately succeeded in persuading Elizabeth to send an English force to assist in the siege of Edinburgh Castle. He remained in Scotland till the castle fell, and in numerous letters to Burghley minutely described the siege, and the negotiations connected with its surrender. Subsequently he was employed in similar diplomatic missions in Scotland, Germany, France, and the Low Countries. The Treaty of Nonsuch gave the English crown the right to designate two councilors to the Dutch council of state. Killegrew served as an English Councillor on the Dutch Council of State in 1586, and again in 1587-1589. While in attendance on the Earl of Essex in France he was knighted on 22 November 1591. He was the first in England to write political memoirs to highlight and defend his actions during his career as a public servant. He died in the spring of 1603, his will having been proved on 16 April.
Artistic activities.
David Lloyd praises Killigrew in his "Worthies" for his learning and his artistic accomplishments. He states that, while a good musician, he was especially skilled as a painter, being "a Dürer for proportion ... an Angelo for his happy fancy, and an Holbein for oyl works", but no authenticated work of his brush is known. Killigrew gave £140 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, for the purchase of St. Nicholas Hostel, the materials of which were applied to the construction of the lodge for Dr. Laurence Chaderton, the first master. His London residence was in Lothbury.
Family.
Killigrew lived in Hendon in Middlesex and Truro in Cornwall. On 4 Nov. 1566 Killigrew married in the church of St Peter Le Poer, London, Catherine, fourth daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke. He thus became Cecil's brother-in-law. His wife died in 1583, and on 7 November 1590 he was married in the same church to Jaél de Peigne, a Frenchwoman. She was naturalised in June 1601, and on 19 April 1617 she married George Downham, bishop of Derry. By his first wife Killigrew had four daughters:
By his second wife he had a daughter, Jane, and two sons, Joseph and Henry. Joseph, ten years old at his father's death, succeeded to his estates.
In fiction.
He is a major character in the historical novel "The Grove of Eagles" by Winston Graham; the novel turns largely on the declining fortunes of his nephew John Killigrew of Arwenack, who looks to his uncle's influence to protect him.

<doc id="19848030" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19848030" title="Greenlandic cuisine">
Greenlandic cuisine

Greenlandic cuisine is traditionally based on meat from marine mammals, game, birds, and fish, and normally contains high levels of protein. Since colonization and the arrival of international trade, the cuisine has been increasingly influenced by Danish and Canadian cuisine. During the summer when the weather is milder, meals are often eaten outdoors.
National dish.
The national dish of Greenland is suaasat, a traditional Greenlandic soup. It is often made from seal, or from whale, reindeer, or sea birds. The soup often includes onions and potatoes, and is simply seasoned with salt and pepper, or bay leaf. The soup is often thickened with rice, or by soaking barley in the water overnight so that the starches leach into the water.
Seafood.
The majority of Greenland is covered by permanent glaciers, the sea is the source for most food. Seafood dishes include various fishes (often smoked), mussels, and shrimp. "Ammassat" or capelin, a fish in the salmon family is commonly eaten and can easily be dried. Atlantic halibut, redfish, deepwater redfish, Greenland halibut, and lumpfish are fished from the west coast, as are Greenland cod ("Gadus ogac") and shorthorn sculpin ("Myoxocephalus scorpius"), but these two are eaten only as a last resort. Arctic char is fished off the east coast. The Greenland shark ("Somniosus microcephalus") is rarely eaten because it is poisonous but can be edible after a complicated preparation of either boiling the meat repeatedly or fermenting the meat.
Global warming has shifted the migration of Atlantic cod, allowing for commercial fishing off Greenland's east coast. Drift ice can create problems during fishing season, and the Danish government has not invested in large-scale fish processing plants.
Sea mammals provide important staples to Greenlandic diets. A traditional Inuit specialty is "mattak", a Greenlandic term for the raw hide of narwhal or white whale. "Mattak" can be prepared with blubber, and occasionally dried reindeer meet. When eaten raw, "mattak" is an important source of vitamin C. Hunting hooded seals were traditionally an important annual social event as well as subsistence activity, which included men, women, and children. Also popular is "arfivik", or Bowhead whale, smoked whale meat served with onions and potato. Dried cod and whale with whale blubber is a popular lunch and snack food. Bearded and ringed seals are hunted year round, especially by Polar Inuit, while narwhals and white whales are hunting during the summer. Subsistence whale hunting by indigenous peoples is legal, but some animal rights organization are concerned about commercial whale hunting in Greenland, with one company, Arctic Green Food freezing and distributing a quarter of Greenland's whale meat.
Meat.
Land-based dishes include reindeer (caribou), lamb, mutton, and musk-ox, which can be served tartare. Sheep farming and cattle ranching were introduced to Greenland by the Norse. Caribou are hunted in the fall, foxes and hares year round, musk-oxen in the spring, and polar bear are hunted in the spring and fall. Meats can be boiled, dried, frozen, fermented, or occasionally eaten raw. Caribou livers are consumed raw, immediately after the hunt.
Fowl.
Spring to fall is the season for hunting wild birds. The Polar Inuit hunt dovekie ("Alle alle"), eider, ptarmigan, thick-billed murre (Brünnich's Guillemot or "Uria lomvia"), and a variety of sea gulls. Additionally, kittiwake and ptarmigan are hunted on the east coast. Sometimes wild eggs are gathered by hunters.
Plants.
Blueberries and crowberries ("Empetrum nigrum"), harvested in the autumn, often garnish cakes and other desserts. Berry compotes accompany meat dishes. Seaweed is stored as a reserve food for winter. During the summer, roseroot ("Sedum rosea"), fireweed ("Epilobium") leaves, and Greenland lousewort ("Pedicularis groenlandica") are gathered. Green vegetables are scarce but global climate change has slightly extended the growing season, so Greenlandic farmers are experimenting with new crops, such as broccoli. Rice, potatoes, and onions are common starches in meals.
Seasoning and herbs.
"Herbs have grown here for a thousand years,” says Anne Sofie Hardenberg, author, cook, and TV and radio personality. “The magical silence Greenland is good for man, herbs, and animals." She is part of the locavore movement, which avoids Scandinavian influences in favor of local Greenlandic culinary traditions. Angelica is a seasoning staple in Greenlandic cuisine. Spices are used sparingly in Greenlandic dishes.
Beverages.
Greenlandic coffee is a popular after-dinner drink. It typically features hot coffee, whiskey, Kahlúa, Grand Marnier, and whipped cream. Served in a bordeaux glass, the coffee is set on fire before drinking.
Ice beer, that features 2000-year-old natural Arctic ice harvested from glaciers, was pioneered by the Greenland Brewhouse in Narsaq. Currently, the Godthaab Bryghus, in Nuuk, and Icefiord Bryghus, in Ilulissat, brew with glacial water. Both crowberries and angelica are brewed into ales at the Icefiord Brewery.
Until 1954, alcohol sales were heavily restricted in Greenland, so homebrewing is widely popular.
Markets.
Until 1980, animal foods comprised most of the Polar Inuit's diet, but grocery stores provide coffee, tea, biscuits, potato chips, and other foods. The diversity of fresh fruit and vegetables varies greatly during the year. In periods where supplies can be delivered by ship (approximately May through November), the diversity is mostly better than in the winter period, where vegetables and fruit only can be delivered by plane.

Kosuke Koyama

In works such as "Water Buffalo Theology" and "Three Mile an Hour God", he defended a theology that he considered to be accessible to the peasantry in developing nations, rather than an overly academic systematic theology. In total, Koyama wrote thirteen books. One of his most well-known books, "Water Buffalo Theology", was described as "ecological theology, liberation theology and contribution to Christian-Buddhist dialogue". In "No Handle on the Cross: An Asian Mediation on the Crucified Mind" (1976), Koyama explained how the cross can be considered the symbol of Christian suffering, and began the book with a chapter entitled "The Cross and the Lunchbox". Koyama explained, in the preface to this book, which he wrote in Tokyo at Christmas 1975, how he did Christian missionary work in Thailand from 1960 to 1968, and how his experiences in Thailand rekindled interest in Asian religion in him (Koyama, 1976). He also explained in the preface how the book grew out of the Earl Lectures which he delivered at the Pacific School of Religion in California. Koyama also spoke at a conference in Edinburgh in 1985, in which he described God as "a hot God", suggesting a certain dynamic quality to the attributes of God.
In his book "No Handle on the Cross" he reflected on his interest in the relationship between history and theology, and also pointed out the imperial nature of Indo-European languages among those speakers of languages such as Sinhalese or Japanese. He also told, in this book, of an incident which happened to him in Singapore, where he met a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka. He told the monk about crusades for Jesus Christ and the monk looked puzzled. "Why do you need to crusade?" asked the monk. The monk indicated that if one felt a need to crusade, then one was not a true disciple. Instead, the monk championed, true to his Buddhist beliefs, the virtue of self-denial.
"Water Buffalo Theology" is probably Koyama's best-known work. The book was partly inspired by Koyama's work as a missionary in Northern Thailand. His works of "Mount Sinai and Mount Fuji" and "Water Buffalo Theology" are, in part, an examination of Christian theology within the context of Thai Buddhist society, growing out of Koyama's missionary experience in Thailand. Koyama was an editor of the "South East Asia Journal of Theology", for which he himself wrote a considerable number of articles. Koyama published at least thirteen books, including "On Christian Life" (currently available only in Japanese) and over one hundred scholarly articles. Koyama's work has been described as helping to bridge the boundaries between East and West, between Christianity and Buddhist thought, between the rich and the poor. It has been pointed out that he has no overarching system in this theology, which shows commitment to serving a "broken Christ trying to heal a broken world". He was named as an important figure for the development of a global Christianity (Cohn-Sherbok, 1998).
Koyama died at a hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts, of pneumonia complicated by oesophagal cancer, on March 25, 2009. His wife Lois died April 13, 2011. He is survived two sons, a daughter, and five grandchildren. (Source: New York Times online, accessed September 7, 2010). His last work was "Theology and Violence: Towards A Theology of Nonviolent Love", published in Japanese in 2009 by Kyobunkwan, a publishing firm in Tokyo (Source: www.pres-outlook.com/news-and-analysis/1/8640.html, accessed April 2009).

Tra quante regione

Tra quante regione (""Amongst all the regions"") is a ballata by the late medieval and early renaissance composer Hugo de Lantins. As with another vocal composition by Guillaume Dufay entitled Vasilissa ergo gaude, Lantins' ballata celebrated the marriage of the Italian princess Cleofa Malatesta with the Byzantine Despot of the Morea Theodore II Palaiologos. The marriage took place on the 21st of January 1421 or sometime in 1422 in Mystra. The actual date and place of the first performance remain disputed

She is a fellow at the American Academy of Microbiology and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Zakian served as the chair of "Princeton's Task force on the Status of Women Faculty in the Natural Sciences and Engineering at Princeton." from 2001-2003, in 2003 Zakian became Princeton University's representative to Nine Universities, Gender Equity Analysis 
Education and career.
Zakian completed her A.B. in Biology at Cornell University, graduating cum laude and with distinction in all subjects, in 1970. Zakian went on to pursue graduate work in Biology at Yale University, while she was working on her Ph.D. (1970-1973) she received a NSF predoctoral fellowship. In 1975, Zakian completed her Ph.D. in Biology, her thesis was supervised by Joseph G. Gall and concerned "DNA replication in Drosophila." Zakian served as a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University from 1975-1976, during this time she conducted research on "animal virus replication" with Dr. AJ Levine. Later in 1976, Zakian continued her postdoctoral research at the University of Washington where she worked on research concerning "yeast DNA Replication" with Dr. WL Fangman.
In 1978, Zakian joined the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center as an assistant member, Zakian was promoted to the position of an "associate member" in 1984 and to the position of"full member" in 1987. During her time at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Zakian published or co-published around sixty articles in peer-reviewed journals like Nature (journal), Cell (journal), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America and the Journal of Molecular Biology. Additionally, during her stay at Fred Hutchinson, Zakian served as either an editor, associate editor or member of the editorial board of journals such as: Plasmid (1986–90), Chromosoma (1990-), J. Exptl. Zoology (1991–96), Trends in Cell Biology (1991–97), Molecular and Cellular Biology (1992–98), Genes to Cells (1994-98).
In 1995, Zakian was appointed as a professor in the Department of Molecular Biology at Princeton University. Zakian was awarded the Harry C. Wiess Professor in the Life Sciences in the Department of Molecular Biology in the year 2000, a position that she holds to this day. Zakian served as the chair of "Princeton's Task force on the Status of Women Faculty in the Natural Sciences and Engineering at Princeton." from 2001-2003, in 2003 Zakian became Princeton University's representative to Nine Universities, Gender Equity Analysis 
Research Area.
Zakian has published 150 papers in peer-reviewed journals throughout her career. Most of Zakian's research concerns telomeres, which are "the regionof repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromatid, which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes." Zakian's lab " uses a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to identify proteins that affect telomeres and to determine their mechanism of action." One of the lab's "major goal[s is to understand how telomeres, the physical ends of chromosomes, contribute to chromosome stability."
Zakian, along with GM Dani, "were the first to construct and characterize a linear artificial chromosome." in 1983. This work, along with another related study helped to introduce the "use ciliate telomeres to generate linear yeast episomes, a strategy that began the molecular era of yeast telomere biology" Zakian, working with a team of other researchers in the paper "Position effect at S. cerevisiae telomeres: reversible repression of Pol II transcription" (Gottschling et al. 1990 Cell) "discovered telomere position effect, TPE, the transcriptional repression of genes near telomeres in budding yeast." In 1994, Zakian, along with Schulz, "identified the Pif1p DNA helicase as an inhibitor of telomere lengthening and especially of telomere formation." In "Pif1p helicase, a catalytic inhibitor of telomerase in yeast." a team of researchers, including Zakian, found that "Pif1p-like helicases are found in diverse organisms, including humans" and that "Pif1p is the prototype member of a helicase subfamily" The team proposed that "Pif1p-mediated inhibition of telomerase promotes genetic stability by suppressing telomerase-mediated healing of double-strand breaks." Ivessa, Zhou and Zakian later discovered another, "highly connected," member of Pif1p's "helicase subfamily" called Rrm3p. In their paper they found that both Pif1p and Rrm3p both "affected rDNA replication but had opposing effects on fork progression."

Täuberln-Walzer ("Little Doves Waltz"), opus 1, is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss I. The work is very simple in form, containing seven melodies without an introduction or coda. It debuted during the carnival of 1826, when Strauss introduced his band to the public of Vienna at the Schwan, in the Roßau suburb of Vienna.
Although it is Strauss' first numbered composition, it was not his first work: he had written several other dances under the name of his friend Josef Lanner when the latter was unable to compose due to an illness.

Suwanni Sukhontha

Suwanni Sukhontha () was the pen name of Suwanni Sukhonthiang (; 1 March 1932 – 3 February 1984), a Thai writer and novelist. In 1971, she won the SEATO Literature Award, the award which has been succeeded by the S.E.A. Write Award after the dissolution of SEATO.
Life.
Education and careers.
Suwanni was born in Phitsanulok Province, Thailand. Her father, Yoi Sukhonthiang (ย้อย สุคนธ์เที่ยง), was a medical officer. Her mother was Taeng-on Sukhonthiang (แตงอ่อน สุคนธ์เที่ยง). Suwanni had one elder sister.
She completed primary education at Phadung Nari-Kawi Phitthaya School (โรงเรียนผดุงนารี-กวีพิทยา) and secondary education at Chaloem Khwan Satri School (โรงเรียนเฉลิมขวัญสตรี) in Phitsanulok Province. She then studied at the Pohchang Academy of Arts (วิทยาลัยเพาะช่าง) in Bangkok for two years. Following that, she studied painting at the Faculty of Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Arts, Silpakorn University, and completed this bachelor's degree in 1951.
After graduation, she became a government officer, working as a government teacher at Bangkok's School of Arts for three years and as a lecturer at Silpakorn University in 1950s. She began writing novels in 1965. In that year, her first short story, "Chot Mai Thueng Puk", was published in Siam Rath Weekly (SRW) and she started using the pen name "Suwanni". She later changed her pen name to "Suwanni Sukhontha" upon suggestion of Pramun Unhathup (ประมูล อุณหธูป), SRW editor-in-chief.
Her first novel, "Sai Bo Yut Sane Hai", was published in "Satri San" (สตรีสาร; "Females' Journal") and met with jubilant welcome. She then resigned from the government post at Silpakorn University and became a full-time writer. She also started a female magazine called "Lalana" (ลลนา; "Girls") in 1972 and later became its editor-in-chief.
Family.
Suwanni married Thawi Nantha-khwang (ทวี นันทขว้าง), her fellow lecturer at Silpakorn University and a National Artist. The two had four children. Because of frequent quarrels, they later divorced.
Following the divorce, Suwanni lived with her longtime friend, Sirisawat Phanthumasut (ศิริสวัสดิ์ พันธุมสุต). When Suwanni and Thawi divorced, one of their children, Duangta Nantha-khwang (ดวงตา นันทขว้าง) or Kop (กบ), was just born. The children were then sent to Chiang Mai Province to live with their grandparents. The family discord also distanced Suwanni and her only son, Wongmueang Nantha-khwang (วงศ์เมือง นันทขว้าง) or Namphu (น้ำพุ), who saw his family as broken and resorted to narcotic drugs. Namphu died of narcotic drug overdose at the age of 18 in 1974.
After the death of Namphu, Suwanni said she had frequently been asked how she could let her son be addicted to drugs and this question always rendered her speechless. Because of her son's death, she also blamed herself for being "incapable of raising a child". Suwanni later adapted his story into a novel called "Phra Chan Si Nam Ngoen" as a lesson for other parents. In its preface, she wrote:
"When I kissed you for the last time, our tears were blended together. I told you to rest in peace, my dear. From that day on, I lived my spiritless life like a wind-up toy. Today, I have just learnt the greatness of the suffering of a mother."
The novel has been adapted into films and television dramas for many times. It also made the term "problem child" (เด็กมีปัญหา) popular in Thai society and called attention to family and drug problems.
Death.
Around 16:30 hours of 3 February 1984, Suwanni was stabbed to death by two young men on her way to a market in Bangkok. The two men, Khachin Sombun (คชินทร์ สมบูรณ์) and Phaithun Sawangphrai (ไพฑูรย์ สว่างไพร), were technical school students and were addicted to narcotic drugs. They wanted to steal her BMW car and seek some money to purchase drugs. Suwanni's dead body was found left in dense grasses behind Siam Park City and eight stab wounds were found on the body. The two students were arrested on 4 February 1984.
When Suwanni died, her novel "Wan Wan" was still in progress. Novelist Kritsana Asoksin (กฤษณา อโศกสิน) later completed it.
Writings.
Suwanni's works were well-known for their realistic structure. She was noted for using a common but sarcastical language in her works, contrary to the style popular at that time. The characters she created were usually ordinary people and reflected the downsides of human beings. Suwanni was also renowned for profound understanding of female psyche and her use of "brush stroke" to create rich imagery.
The following is an incomplete list:
In popular culture.
Many of her novels have been adapted into films and television dramas. These include:
In several television dramas, Suwanni was notably portrayed by Sinjai Plengpanich. Suwanni was also portrayed by Patravadi Mejudhon in the 1984 film adaption of "Phra Chan Si Nam Ngoen".

Steven O'Shaughnessy

Steven Joseph O'Shaughnessy, often known as Steve (born 9 September 1961, Bury, Lancashire, England) is a former English cricketer, who played for Lancashire and Worcestershire in the 1980s, and then had a substantial career in Minor Counties cricket with Cumberland. Since retiring from playing, he has become an umpire, and was promoted in December 2010 to the first-class panel for the 2011 season.
Life and career.
He was selected for the England Young Cricketers tour of the West Indies in 1979–80, playing in all three Youth Tests. He was successful with the bat, hitting 130 from number eight in the second match at Castries and then, higher up the order, 81 and 93 in the third game at Bridgetown. He was also to play for the Young Cricketers against their Indian counterparts in 1981, but with less success.
O'Shaughnessy made his List A debut on 1 June 1980, in a John Player League for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Aigburth, though his contribution was minimal as he was dismissed for one and neither bowled nor held a catch. His first-class debut was just three days later, against Oxford University at The University Parks where he made an unbeaten 50 and took two catches in a ten-wicket victory. He took 3–23 in a John Player League match against Hampshire in late July, and ended the summer with seven List A wickets, but his only first-class victim of the season was Yorkshire opener Richard Lumb in late August.
From 1981 until 1987, O'Shaughnessy played fairly regularly in the Lancashire side. He made two of his five first-class centuries in 1983 (100* versus Yorkshire and a contrived 105 against Leicestershire, of which more below), but it was 1984 which proved to be his best year with the bat. He passed a thousand first-class runs for the only summer of his career, hitting 1,167 at 34.32, including the other three centuries, the highest – and his career-best – being 159* against Somerset at Bath. 1984 also saw his only List A hundred: 101* against Leicestershire in August. As a bowler, his highest season's aggregates were 27 in 1982 for first-class cricket and 26 in 1984 for the one-day game. His career-best returns were 4–66 against Nottinghamshire in the County Championship in 1982, and 4–17 against Leicestershire in the 1985 Benson & Hedges Cup.
An unusual incident occurred on the last day of the 1983 County Championship season. Lancashire were playing Leicestershire, and rain had delayed the start of play by a day and a half. On the final afternoon, facing an attack consisting of David Gower (9–0–102–0) and James Whitaker (8–1–87–0), Lancashire openers Graeme Fowler and O'Shaughnessy both scored centuries: Fowler's in 46 minutes and O'Shaughnessy's in 35.
This performance won O'Shaughnessy the Walter Lawrence Trophy for the fastest century of the season, despite its contrived circumstances, and equalled Percy Fender's 1920 record. Fender himself, by then 91 years old and blind, sent O'Shaughnessy a telegram: "Congratulations on equalling my 63-year-old record. Fender" and the two men met a few days later at Fender's home in Horsham.
O'Shaughnessy received his Lancashire cap in 1985, but he had a disastrous summer in first-class cricket. In 23 innings he passed 50 only once, and his average was barely 13.
He did better in one-day cricket, averaging over 29, but (the aforementioned 4–17 notwithstanding) the wickets were starting to dry up: he would only ever take two wickets in a List A innings once more.
The next two seasons were rather better so far as batting was concerned, though his bowling fell away further: he took just 12 first-class wickets in the two seasons combined, averaging 72 and 50 in 1986 and 1987 respectively.
In 1988, O'Shaughnessy moved to Worcestershire, and his career with his new employer began promisingly with 50 against his old county in the Refuge Assurance League at Old Trafford.
He followed it up with 44 in the Championship against Nottinghamshire at Worcester.
However, it proved to be a false dawn. That 44 remained his highest first-class score for Worcestershire, and although he did strike 62 versus Hampshire in the NatWest Trophy semi-final,
he failed badly with the rest of the top order in the final, being dismissed for one run.
By 1989, O'Shaughnessy was spending considerable amounts of time in the Second XI, and made only one first-class appearance (against the touring Australians), and although he played in 12 List A games he enjoyed little success. After the Refuge Assurance League game against Kent at the end of July, O'Shaughnessy would not be seen again in a Worcestershire shirt, nor indeed in first-class cricket.
Although no longer involved in county cricket at the highest level, he continued to play Minor Counties cricket for a decade. As well as his numerous games for Cumberland (which gave him the occasional List A appearance in the NatWest Trophy) he turned out on one occasion in 1990 for Northumberland.
He also played in Australia for the Australian Capital Territory on a few occasions in the early 1990s, and in 2003 and 2004 played club cricket for Alderley Edge Cricket Club.
O'Shaughnessy's final List A appearance came for Cumberland against Scotland in the C&G Trophy in August 2003.
He scored 8, and thus missed by just one run the chance to have scored 3,000 List A runs in his career.

Career.
He served in the Royal Canadian Engineers. He returned to RMC from 1936-40 as Lieutenant Colonel staff-adjutant. In May 1939, he announced to the RMC on behalf of the Commandant 816 Brigadier K. Stuart that the present class would not be offered commissions until June 1941. This decision was made because the government had decided that an applicant for a Canadian commission had to be at least 20 years old. Ex-cadets were delighted by this policy. The largest recruit class since World War I, one hundred cadets, arrived in Kingston, Ontario in Augusy 1940. He was promoted to Brigadier, General Staff, army headquarters and Major-General Commanding Officer of the 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division from January 1943 to October 1943.

5-4-3-2-Run

5-4-3-2-Run is a Canadian game show for kids that ran from about 1988 to 1990 on CTV in Canada and on many independent stations in the United States. Hosted by Andrew Cochran, the show combined general knowledge questions, wacky stunts and messy surprises similar to "Double Dare".
Gameplay.
Two full games were played during each show. The contestants, known as "runners", were randomly picked out of the studio audience upon a correct response to a question. Four players were chosen for each game, and once chosen they were asked to put on protective capes because some elements of the game were messy.
In each round, a category was given and possible answers were shown on monitors at the end of the playing course. The goal was to pick the answers that fit within the category. To give time to randomize the answers, the players were asked to complete a stunt such as walking on bucket stilts, stomping balloons, picking up straws, etc. Once they reached the bin at the other end of the course, each player chose one of the answers and were also given the option of staying where they were or trading into the one seat that was empty or with another player (in the latter event, the other must agree to the trade for it to take place). When all players were satisfied with their choice, they pushed a plunger on the desk. Those who picked a correct answer moved on to the next round, while the person who picked the incorrect answer would get something dumped on their head and be eliminated from further play, winning a consolation prize. The two players remaining at the end of the game would move on to the bonus round.
"Surprises".
A player who chose an incorrect answer would get a "surprise" dumped on them from a tube above their head. Some were silly, such as ping-pong balls and Monopoly money, while others were messy, such as whipped cream. The most popular form of surprise was a gooey dropping of colored slime - either blue (aka the "Blue Goo"), green (aka the "Green Stream") or purple (aka the "Purple Slurple").
Bonus Round.
The two winners from each game played in the bonus round. The players were shown four prizes, and were asked to choose the prize they most wanted to play for. If only one player chose a particular prize, that player had to answer only one question to win that prize. If more than one player chose the same prize, then a "face-off" took place with the last person to give a correct answer to a question winning the prize. Nobody left the game empty-handed, at the very least they took home a board game as their prize.

Toponogov's theorem

In the mathematical field of Riemannian geometry, Toponogov's theorem (named after Victor Andreevich Toponogov) is a triangle comparison theorem. It is one of a family of theorems that quantify the assertion that a pair of geodesics emanating from a point "p" spread apart more slowly in a region of high curvature than they would in a region of low curvature.
Let "M" be an "m"-dimensional Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature "K" satisfying
formula_1
Let "pqr" be a geodesic triangle in "M", such that the geodesic "pq" is minimal and if δ ≥ "0", the length of the side "pr" is less than formula_2.
Let "p"′"q"′"r"′ be a geodesic triangle in the space form "M"δ such that the length of sides "p′q′" and "p′r′"is equal to that of "pq" and "pr" respectively and the angle at "p′" is equal to that at "p". 
Then
When the sectional curvature is bounded from above, a corollary to the Rauch comparison theorem yields an analogous statement, but with the reverse inequality.

Bernard Turnbull

Bernard Turnbull (16 October 1904–7 April 1984) was a Welsh international centre who played club rugby for Cardiff and was capped six times for Wales. Turnbull has been described as a dogged and unimaginative centre, but with the ability to finish off the work of others. Turnbull captained Wales on one occasion in 1927.
Rugby career.
Turnbull played rugby as a boy for St. Peters RFC, one of the smaller teams based in Cardiff, along with his brothers, Maurice and Kevin. Maurice would later play for Cardiff and like his brother would also represent Wales, though he is better known for representing England at cricket.
Bernard Turnbull was first selected to play for Wales against Ireland in the 1925 Five Nations Championship under the captaincy of Idris Jones. Wales were humiliated in the match, losing 19-3, in the biggest victory Ireland had achieved against Wales. Turnbull scored the only points for Wales with a try, his only international points. Turnbull missed the 1926 Championship, but was re-selected for the 1927 tournament and in the opening match against England was given the captaincy. In a tight game played at Twickenham, Wales lost narrowly 11-9, and even scored more tries then their opponents; a good feat considering they played three quarters of the match with 14 men after Dai Jones was injured in the first half. Turnbull played in the next game of the championship against Scotland, but for the third time found himself on a losing Welsh team.
Turnbull's next game was against England in the 1928 Five Nations Championship, in a game Wales should have won but for a slip by the normally reliable Rowe Harding. Turnbull was now on four match losing streak for Wales but his next game was against France, who had failed to beat Wales in the first 13 Championship encounters. Like the 1927 match against England, France were a 14-man team for the majority of the game after an early injury; and therefore when Wales lost the game the result was an even bigger embarrassment. Turnbull was not selected for the 1929 Welsh season, but was back in 1930 for his final game against Scotland at Murrayfield. Wales lost 12-9 and Turnbull ended his international career without experiencing a Welsh victory.
In 1931, Turnbull faced the touring South African team as part of the Cardiff team. Turnbull turned out with his brother Maurice and fellow Welsh internationals Ronnie Boon, Archie Skym and captain Harry Bowcott. Although Cardiff lost, sports journalist 'Old Stager' said: "B. R. Turnbull was the best centre on the field, ubiquitous in defence and valiant in attack."

Havant Town F.C.

Havant Town F.C. was an English football club based in Havant, Hampshire. They ceased to exist in 1998 when they merged with Waterlooville to form Havant & Waterlooville.
History.
Havant F.C. were formed in 1883 and played in the Portsmouth League. In 1958 they merged with Leigh Park (who had just won the FA Sunday Cup) to form Havant & Leigh Park. The merged club won the Portsmouth League at the first attempt, and in 1970 stepped up to Division Four of the Hampshire League. After several promotions the club reached Division One by 1977. In order to progress further, the club were seeking to move away from their basic Front Lawn ground. They purchased the site of West Leigh Park in 1980 and moved in in August 1982, at which point the club was renamed Havant Town.
In 1986 the club became founder members of the Wessex League. After winning the league in 1990–91 they were promoted to Division One South of the Southern League, where they remained until merging with nearby Waterlooville F.C. in 1998.
