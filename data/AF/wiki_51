Social software in education

Social software is used in education. This use of social software is discussed here, with an emphasis on how research results can inform the practice of teachers and learners.
Background.
Software for Learning Becoming Social.
Stereotypical views of software suggest that it is written by nerds and used by individuals, but the reality may be different. Any significant or established piece of software is likely to be the result of a collaborative effort by software developers , working together or building on someone's previous work. Figure 1 appears to show students working individually at their computers.
At face value, this use of software does not seem to be very social but the reality could be different, with students engaging in online chats, sending emails, posting in discussion forums with friends and acquaintances, near and far. Even where only one person is using the computer, everyone around can be joining in and having fun, as in Figure 2.
Software on a single computer being used in a classroom can be seen as an activity in a social setting. The student using the computer may talk to the teacher and other students, asking for help, sharing information and reactions to their experiences of the software in use.
A study of young children’s use of a program for drawing and writing found that they were not only reading printed texts and writing on paper but also engaging in multimedia, computer-based composition . This effect has also been observed with students using a shared system. An experiment with Group Decision Support Systems revealed university students’ appreciation of and benefit from the information structuring and sharing features of the system (Alavi, 1994).
A more recent exploratory video study into young people's use of games consoles reveals that individual use takes places in a rich social context.
“"Games intended to engage a single player were shown to incorporate cooperation with, and the contribution of, others."” (Schott & Kambouri, 2006).
This study found examples where collaborative play was more effective for learning than explicit instruction.
Others believe that software can enable the engineering of social interaction. One approach to using software for learning aligns with a programmatic, step by step approach to learning that fits with learning as instruction, knowledge as transmission (see Table 1). The claim is that learning and other social activities can be programmed just like a computer. The "Games, Action, and Social Software" group at Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIAS):
“"argue that the issue of constructing and verifying social procedures, which Professor Rohit Parikh suggestively calls social software, be pursued as systematically as computer software is constructed and analysed by computer scientists." (see "What is Social Software? ,")” (NIAS, 2006) [http://www.nias.knaw.nl/en/press_releases/rohit_parikh/].
This programmatic approach is evident in variants of online course design. others being described in the context of Web 2.0 technologies that view the trend towards great social networking online as simply an evolution of elearning rather than a major paradigm shift. The utilisation of social software, however, is not simply a new way to teach content, it is method that shifts our relationship with knowledge to include a greater emphasis on peer-to-peer sharing of knowledge, towards more flexible sharing (favouring wikis and web sites over formal journals and copyright) and more ephemeral knowledge (the constantly updating world of blogs and RSS feeds (Mason and Rennie, 2008). Researchers have consequently explored a changing educational landscape where social networking (using a whole variety of new applications) is no longer the one-way transmission of knowledge, but a collaborative process of research and sharing that is no longer linear, not necessarily under the full control of the tutor, and places a higher value on the co-creation, sharing, and re-purposing of educational resources, and above all on increased "interaction" between the learning participants (Mason and Rennie, 2006).
The term "social software" (see later at came into popular use from 2003 after Clay Shirky’s influential article on social software and groups (Shirky, 2003) [http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_politics.html. It is fairly straightforward to trace the evolution of social software in parallel with the development of tele-communications and the Internet/WWW (Allen, 2006) The spread of tele-communications networking in the late 1970s was a trigger that led to an increase in ‘social’ uses where users could interact remotely through networked software. Usenet, group chat, and MUDs all developed within the space of 18 months (Shirky, 2003)[http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_politics.html.
Text-based games were played on local networks, Arpanet and other networks that preceded the Internet as we know it now. Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) are text-based games that allow players to adopt roles on a complex virtual environment that exists mainly in the players’ imaginations. They rely on text-based communication and invocation of rules programmed into the MUD. MOOs, introduced in the 1990s are MUDs that can be configured using their own built-in object-oriented language (Bartle, n.d.) Though many links to MUDs and MOOs are now dead, you can find some useful information and examples at this site (Jobe, 2000)[http://www.education-world.com/a_tech/tech010.shtml . There are links to some useful examples, such as this one where students collaborated online to learn and produce resources ("Water Pollution in Brazil and California," 2002). Computer users could get in touch with each other: talk, argue, play, get to know each other. In the 1980s, the possibilities for the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in education became clear (Hiltz & Wellman, 1997). The WELL, Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, an early example of virtual community, started in 1985, forming a meaningful community for members, some of whom met face to face, and others who never met (Rheingold, 1994) (see links at [http://wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/On-line_communities). With the advent of the Internet in the 1990s, new opportunities opened up for learning.
Learning Becoming Social.
Informal learning has always been social, but trends in education and technology have led to a growth in social learning, even in formal education. Formal institutions for learning, schools, colleges and universities have a fairly long history but limited to an elite. Most of the population of Europe and the United States had no schooling whatsoever until the first half of the nineteenth century (Giddens, 1993), and education for all children has yet to be achieved in all countries. Education statistics published in May 2008 show that 75 million children were out of school in 2006, down from 103 million in 1999 UNESCO, 2008. Learning within the family setting, socialisation, is a large part of most children’s learning experiences, it being where they first learn about roles, relationships and responsibilities within the family, the wider community and society, (Alexander & Clyne, 1995).
We also learn about our culture through social groups and through work, by experience and social interaction, sometimes called enculturation. Young children also learn through play, often in a social setting with their friends. This is in contrast with formal learning in academic environments that focuses on learning from descriptions of the real world, rather than from direct experience of it.
"“Learning in naturalistic contexts is synergistic with the context; the learning outcome is an aspect of the situation, an aspect of the relation between learner, activity and environment, so it is learning about that world and how it works.”" (Laurillard, 1993)
As education became a goal of industrial societies, in turn it became the object of study itself. The twentieth century saw the development of a rich variety of learning theories (many outlined in the useful Theory into Practice database). It is impossible to categorise these theories but we can identify three themes broadly based on how they interpret and theorise about learning and teaching (see Table 1), and link these to developments in learning technology. We do not suggest that these themes developed in any sequence but rather they are interconnecting strand of thought. Each of these themes has developed over time and enjoyed variable popularity at different times. In practice, tutors may incorporate elements from any or all of these themes in designing and conducting learning activities with students.
Instruction – teaching and learning of explicit knowledge and skills.
The first theme is that of instruction, where learning is seen as pre-planned, determined by a teacher or instructor. Knowledge is understood as something that can be transmitted from teacher to student. Techniques include programmed learning, tutorials, lectures, and drill-and-practice (Cronje, 2000) This approach is seen as traditional, founded on behavioural psychology, e.g. behaviourism "Operant Conditioning (B.F. Skinner)" (Kearsley, 1994) [http://tip.psychology.org/skinner.html. Rather than being superseded by later approaches, we can see "instruction" as an ongoing theme, evident in elements of much of the current practice, even where a "social constructivist" approach is being adopted. For example, a UK undergraduate will almost certainly receive some formal lectures, alongside more active learning activities such as simulations and group work.
Social Constructivism.
Social and experiential theories of learning were increasingly applied to technology-enhanced learning in the third quarter of the twentieth century. Exponents regard truth as testable in action with observable outcomes, hence always open to criticism and revision (Dewey, 1991).
Constructivism asserts that although humans possess some innate cognitive potentialities, human knowledge is largely constructed (Phillips, 1995). Early constructivist work, e.g. Piaget’s emphasised the individual, but interest grew in social constructivism. This is an approach, based on phenomenology, that places a greater emphasis on the importance of social interactions in affecting the individual's generation of knowledge or facts about the world.
Figure 3 - The Constructivist Shift, after (Goodyear et al., 2001)
Another challenge to theories of rational action was the emphasis on situated action, with plans being formulated pre or post-hoc but abandoned in the messy reality of embodied action. Two examples of social constructivist approaches are situated cognition, (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989) and situated learning, (Lave & Wenger, 1991).
""Situated cognition theorists suggest that knowledge and the conditions under which is it used are inextricably linked. Social cognitivists indicate that learning is a goal-directed activity that is connected to the social contexts, including people, in which it occurs or is ultimately applied. Both views promote learning in realistically complex contexts that do not decontextualize knowledge and skills from the circumstances in which they are applied."" (Hannafin, 1997).
Vygotsky’s work, from much earlier in the twentieth century, has been re-appraised in the new context of computer-mediated communication (CMC). Vygotsky’s emphasis on language as a tool for mediation in the social process of education, and the agency of the teacher and more experienced peers in the educational development of the individual, assumed new significance in the use of CMC in education (Bacalarski, 1994) [http://psych.hanover.edu/vygotsky/bacalar.html]. Like Dewey, Vygotsky viewed meaning and experience as primarily social.
Moore's transactional distance theory is characterised along three axes
""There are three key variables to consider regarding transactional distance: structure, dialogue, and learner autonomy. Structure is determined by the actual design of the course, the organization of the instruction, and the use of various media of communications. There are also different forms of dialogue: two-way, real-time communication versus dialogue internalized within the student. Finally, learner autonomy depends upon the individual learner's sense of personal responsibility and self-directedness. "" (Transactional Distance Theory, 2002) [http://cde.athabascau.ca/cmc/transactional.html]
Critical pedagogy – learning as empowerment.
In critical pedagogies, knowledge is seen as inseparable from the power relations that exist in its context. Paolo Freire and Ivan Illich have been key 20th Century influences on those who challenge societal and power relations that underpin institutions such as schools and universities, formal education systems
Illich promoted the idea of Deschooling in a critique of education that had four aspects:
• The process of institutionalization that can undermine people’s autonomy and creativity
• Experts and expertise that can control knowledge production and can remove power from individuals to decide on what is knowledge and how they can shape their environment
• Commodification, whereby learning is treated as a commodity that can be controlled and priced above the means of many, making it scarce rather than available – “a thing rather than an activity”.
• The principle of counterproductivity, the means by which a fundamentally beneficial process or arrangement is turned into a negative one. 'Once it reaches a certain threshold, the process of institutionalization becomes counterproductive'. In schools that have reached a certain threshold of institutionalization, students can stop learning and even unlearn (Smith, 1997a) [http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-illic.htm].
These ideas are particularly interesting in societies where the Internet is widely diffused. The Internet offers people opportunities to access vast amounts of data, but on the other hand the data can be structured in highly commodified ways.
Freire’s work has had significant influence on informal education, and his emphasis on conversational rather than curricular forms of education can give insights into the effective use of social software in learning. His work was practical and his ‘pedagogy of the oppressed’ was concerned with how people’s experience of education could help them to change their lives (Smith, 1997b)[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-freir.htm].
Lundin has characterized as feral learning, the learning that people engage in to satisfy learning needs that emerge in their day to day lives, using search engines, networks of contacts (Lundin,1998) [http://science.uniserve.edu.au/newsletter/vol13/lundin.html].
In Open Source Software (OSS) Development communities, developers, testers and users work collaboratively to create a common good, software whose licence is open to further adaptation and improvement. Examples in education can be found at School Forge (Schoolforge.net, 2008)[http://www.schoolforge.net/].
There is also a growing Open Content (OC) movement that seeks to make educational resources freely available, through information and communication technologies as they become globally diffused. The Cape Town Declaration (not without its detractors) encapsulates some of the lofty goals of this movement (The Cape Town Open Education Declaration, 2007) “The Open Data Commons – Public Domain Dedication & Licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify, and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions.” (Open Data Commons, n.d.) [http://www.opendatacommons.org/. In both OSS and OC, social software is key to the creation, improvement and dissemination of the products of these communities.
Formal and Informal Learning.
We all continue to learn throughout our lives, mostly outside of formal education programmes and institutions. Even where education is formally organized, as in schools, colleges and universities, student learning undertaken under the control or initiative of the learner can be seen as informal. The following examples illustrate the variety of sectors and contexts:
• Students from different countries engaging in collaboration online to solve a problem: formally they learn about problem-solving and informally they learn about each other’s cultures, see http://www.cabweb.net, and http://tlgplace.ning.com
• Older people with coronary heart disease engaging in a virtual community to learn more about their condition and how to live with it, see http://www.heartsofsalford.net
• Trades union members, see http://www.workersliberty.org/
• Genealogy enthusiasts joining list servers and discussion forums to get answers to questions, and incidentally from learning about search techniques, software and approaches to data organization, see http://www.genesreunited.com/ and http://www.freebmd.org.uk/ that is engaged in the collaborative transcription of Civil Registration index of births, marriages and deaths for England and Wales
Summary.
Two trends emerge in learning, particularly within the context of technology use. The first trend is the towards the social, often in formal group work or informal study groups or associations that may extend way beyond a class cohort. The social construction of knowledge relies heavily on dialogue, and this may be between students and possibly a teacher within a group. Social software can give very effective support to, not only dialogue, but also non-verbal and non-direct forms of communication . The second is the rise in informal learning, where the potential for power shifts to occur and for learners to form their own groups and associations is very important. This too can be supported by social software. How social software supports these two themes for educational purposes has recently been reviewed by Mason and Rennie (2008).
Definitions.
Social Presence.
Rourke, Anderson, Garrison & Archer (1999) define social presence as the ability of learners to project themselves socially and affectively into an online community of inquiry. Three categories of response are identified:
Affective - the expression of emotion, feelings, and mood
Interactive - those that show that someone else is attending to the poster
Cohesive - those that draw the community together (sometimes called weaving)
They offer social presence density calculation as an important quantitative description of computer conferencing environments (Rourke, Anderson, Garrison, & Archer, 1999)
[http://cade.athabascau.ca/vol14.2/rourke_et_al.html].
Research has also shown that communication richness may be revealed by the application of critical social theory. communicating via electronic media ""perform social acts in action situations that are normatively regulated by, and already have meaning within the organisational context"" (Ngwenyama & Lee, 1997) [http://www.coba.usf.edu/departments/isds/faculty/abhatt/rm/Ngwenyama97-CST.pdf].
An example of this could the power relations that underpin a set of text messages between a group of young people where meaning could only be understood within that social context. A bullying text from a stranger would have a very different impact.
Social Network Sites.
In a recent review paper, boyd and Ellison define social network sites “as web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system. The nature and nomenclature of these connections may vary from site to site” (boyd & Ellison, 2007)[http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html].
This Commoncraft video gives an excellent explanation of Social Networking (LeFever, 2007) [http://www.youtube.com/v/x66lV7GOcNU&hl=en&fs=1].
Social Software.
Social software can be defined as software that supports group communication (Shirky, 2003) In its current manifestations, there are three key activities that social software supports: "conversational interaction" between individuals and groups; "social feedback" where groups rate the contributions of members; and "social networks" where the links between individuals and groups are made visible (S. Boyd, 2006)[http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2006/10/are_you_ready_f.html.It also has the capacity for control and structure to emerge from user interaction rather than solely by design (Dron,2006). For example, in a VLE such as Blackboard, a group is determined and allocated by the instructor or teacher. In contrast, in a social networking environment, such as elgg, individual users can make many groups and form networks of association by "friending". Students told to engage in discussion on a forum visible to their teacher may set up a backchannel (on Instant messaging or mobile phone) to help them manage their 'viewed' discussion.
Social Translucence.
Erickson and Kellogg define socially translucent systems as ones that exhibit three properties - visibility, awareness, and accountability - in supporting social interaction. They make social information visible to help participants to understand what is happening; and to be held accountable for their own actions. They say "In socially translucent systems we believe it will be easier for users to carry on coherent discussions; to observe and imitate others' actions; to engage in peer pressure; to create, notice, and conform to social conventions. We see social translucence as a fundamental requirement for supporting all types of communication and collaboration." An implication is that participants need to be aware of all three properties and what they mean within the context for the interactions (Erickson & Kellogg, 2002) [http://www.pliant.org/personal/Tom_Erickson/st_TOCHI.html].
Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is sometimes called the read/write web, evident through technologies such as Blogs ("What is blogging?," n.d.) Wikis ("What is Wiki?," n.d.) [http://www.wiki.com/whatiswiki.htm and media sharing sites, such as YouTube and flickr [http://flickr.com/. O'Reilly stresses the business opportunities offered by a move to the Internet as platform, harnessing its network effects. Software is seen as a process of engagement with users, rather than as an artefact that resides on a single device Web 2.0 has many applications in education (Anderson, 2005)[http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/techwatch/tsw0701b.pdf.
Current state of the art.
Social software is evident in commercial and open source services, software and packages. Examples include:
1. reviewing and recommender functions, such as in the e-commerce site, Amazon
2. 'free' but commercial social network services, such as Facebook and Bebo through their basic functionality and add-on applications
3. commercially licensed software, such as commercial virtual learning environments, that contain elements of support for social interaction e.g. Blackboard, and specific packages such as First Class for communication and collaboration, and Elluminate for online 'live' classrooms
4. open source software packages that may be free-standing tools, such as forums, or virtual learning environments (also called learning management systems), the most notable of which is Moodle . Open Source Development projects may have educational support communities or networks associated with them, for example Moodle and Eduspaces (that sprang from the elgg OSS community).
Educators will be looking for appropriate software that can support the three key activities from our definition of social software: conversational interaction between individuals and groups; social feedback where groups rate the contributions of members; and social networks where the links between individuals and groups are made visible.
Conversational Interaction between Individuals and Groups.
Any virtual learning environment is likely to support conversational interaction through email and discussion forums, within class cohorts and other groups, defined by the institution. Students may use multiple channels to support social and work-related communication, each occupying its niche, e.g. forums for class-wide discussion, private messaging for personal contact, and email for intra-team communication (Haythornthwaite, 2001. However, support for social feedback and learner-led groupings like personal social networks is likely to be thin in widely used commercial VLEs, see examples here Well-established VLEs were predicated on top-down control and organisation, and will need to make radical changes to their architectures to accommodate true social networking features. Blackboard has pursued a policy of adding to functionality by acquiring software that is then incorporated as 'building blocks' but the integration is often superficial. For example, the link to a person's name is more likely to pull up an email form, rather than to their 'linkable' profile and on to their blog, wikis, etc. Blackboard has ProjectNG on the horizon [http://www.blackboard.com/projectNG/, and promises to incorporate Web 2.0 functionality and OSS content (but not the other way around). One advantage of an institutional implementation of conversational tools (as a by-product of a VLE) is that student enrolment is managed, and the teacher can concentrate on structuring the activity for pedagogic purposes.
Social feedback.
Social feedback may come in the form of conversational responses, from students and teachers who are effective communicators and facilitators. Salmon's 5 Stage model puts facilitating, supporting and responding in the last two stages (Salmon, 2000)[http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml], implying that these are more advanced skills for students.
Emoticons may be used to express a wider range of responses, usually expressed by non-verbal communication: for example to soften negative statements, or to express enthusiastic approval or humour (Bell & Zaitseva, 2005) [http://www.wwwords.co.uk/pdf/viewpdf.asp?j=elea&vol=2&issue=4&year=2005&article=4_Bell_ELEA_2_4_web&id=146.87.255.19]. On the other hand, emoticons may be perceived as childish, or not appropriate in formal education. Emoticons are routinely available in chat rooms and forums in the public domain, but are not currently embedded in every VLE. For example, Moodle has emoticons but they are not available in current versions of Blackboard.
Social feedback may also be given through the commenting on and rating of contributions, e.g. blog or discussion forum postings, or uploads to photo or video sharing sites. In Moodle, a teacher can set up scales in Forums, Glossaries and Assignments for students and teachers to rate a student's activity [http://docs.moodle.org/en/Scales].
However, extrinsic rewards can be counter-productive, especially with complex activities, where too much emphasis on the outcome can de-motivate and reduce intrinsic satisfaction (Kohn, n.d.)[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/motivation.html].
Feedback on learning processes can be encouraged through reflective threads in discussion forums, or through the use of reflective journals (offered in Moodle as an activity, and through personal development planning software). This is not particularly social, as journals are usually one to one between student and teacher.
Social Networks.
Where social software exhibits 'social translucence', personal social networks may be visible implicitly. For example, Moodle offers the chance for participants to see who is in their space or course, and who else is online at the same time, as this screen shot shows.
This knowledge of who is in their course and whether or not they are online may provoke multi-channel communications such as private messages, forum posts and emails that can strengthen participants' personal social networks. Clicking on Frances Bell's name in the example above would allow logged in users to send her a private message, access her profile (where she may have provided links to other channels such as Skype), and check forum posts she has made.
Free commercial social networks such as Facebook allow individuals to make their personal networks visible explicitly by use of 'friending' and other relationship management features.
Facebook was started by Mark Zuckerberg and co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes when they were students at Harvard. University networks still use a valid email address to establish membership of a Facebook University network. Universities have made use of Facebook for social and marketing purposes but there are obstacles to the incorporation of its use into 'official' educational activities. Students may object to academics entering what they see as 'their space', sometimes called the 'creepy treehouse' effect (Stein,2008) [http://flexknowlogy.learningfield.org/2008/04/09/defining-creepy-tree-house/]. Institutions may also be wary of their staff instigating dialogue in spaces where they have no control over blocking users or deleting offensive posts, yet being found guilty by association when problems occur.
There is a subtle difference between Blackboard's Sync Facebook application [http://wiki.blackboardsync.com/display/SYNC/About+Blackboard+Sync] that pushes course information out to students and the Open University's Course Profiles
application [http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogarchive/010855.html] that is based on student self-reporting and open information-sharing of recommendations on course. University of Leicester used Facebook to encourage socialisation between students on an online course.
[http://www.topuniversities.com/student_survival_guide/features/article/face_to_face_or_facebook/]
Two examples of social networking software that takes account of educational needs are elgg and Ning. Elgg is an OSS package that facilitates social networks for learning, with v1.0 released in August 2008 [http://news.elgg.org/pg/blog/Dave/read/47/elgg-v10-has-left-the-building, for example the University of Brighton's social network for students and staff Community@Brighton [http://community.brighton.ac.uk/] http://community.brighton.ac.uk/.
Ning is a social networking service that allows users to set up their own networks, all hosted on Ning servers, usually based around a common interest. There is a 'free' service, funded by advertisements, and a paid-for service with some additional features [http://www.ning.com/].
http://education.ning.com
Drupal an OSS Content Management System (CMS) is also used for educational purposes, and offers modules to support social networking [http://groups.drupal.org/social-networking-sites. Implementing your own site using Drupal or elgg gives institutions maximum control over data and functionality but requires an investment of resources in customising, installing and maintaining the site. A Ning network allows a teacher (or anyone) to set up and manage a network fairly easily, but the data resides on a Ning server.
Implications for practice.
There are four key areas of implications for practice on the use of social software in formal education: academic development; curriculum, delivery and technology design; decisions on what is provided by educational institutions; and digital literacy for social learning.
Academic Development.
Teachers and Learning Technologists have a challenging task to keep up to date with the results of research and emerging technologies themselves. This can be done through formal channels, such as workshops, training and conferences; or through online networks deploying social software and social networking services. Increasingly, social software is being included in academic delivery to help with both formal assessments and with formative and/or self-help assessments that encompass peer-to-peer learning.
Critical success factors.
Maximising success in the use of state of the art social software in learning is currently more of an art than a science, given the relative newness of much of the social software and social networking services currently available. However, teachers and students using social software can be guided by research results from earlier results from the social use of computer-mediated communication.
Teachers Understanding of Social Software.
Teachers establishing learning activities for students will be guided by social theories of learning and by their knowledge of what different social software packages and services offer in the support of learning.
ICT Literacy Skills.
Students (and teachers) need to develop ICT literacy skills that enable them to create and engage critically with digital media artifacts, and offer social feedback to their peers.
Support for Co-Construction of Knowledge.
To enable learning to be constructed (in part at least) by online interaction within a social group, participants should be able to engage in dialogue, through discussion forums, chats and other tools. Dialogue can focus around ideas or artifacts (such as images, videos and texts). Knowledge can also be co-constructed through collaborative tools such as Wikis and group blogs.
Social Networks for Learning.
Both students and teachers can become independent managers of their own learning by seeking, exploring and testing ideas with others within their own social network, beyond the constraints of a classroom. Each student has their own social network for learning including classmates and others, and that will persist (though changing) beyond the period of their formal education. Social networking services can assist in this persistence.
Issues and future directions.
Anderson asserts that social software, and the emerging educational semantic web will deliver cost savings and improvements in the effectiveness of distance learning (Anderson 2005) [http://www.unisa.edu.au/odlaaconference/PPDF2s/13%20odlaa%20-%20Anderson.pdf].
Social software is emergent and offered through a variety of tools and services. This means that VLEs may lag behind Web 2.0 offerings in terms of features, tempting teachers to utilize non-institutional implementations. Such a decision represents a trade off between reliability and richness: a risk that is more easily managed by an autonomous student than a teacher with professional responsibilities of care. Teachers and students will negotiate delicate division of responsibilities between the formal, teacher-directed learning supported by institutional software and learning initiated by the learner using tools and in environments most suited to what and how they wish to learn.
Conclusions.
Teachers experience and reflect on their own use of social software to help them plan and evaluate use with their students. As for students social software is also a vehicle for teachers learning about technology innovations that emerge from design research and human innovation. The evaluative research on how these innovations become embedded in practice tends to lag behind the innovation itself. There is, however, a growing body of work on the student experience to ascertain what is appropriate and likely to be effective.

Rocky Brands

Rocky Brands, Inc., formerly known as Rocky Shoes & Boots, Inc., designs, develops, manufactures and markets outdoor, work, western and Military footwear as well as outdoor and work apparel and accessories. The company was founded in 1932 in Nelsonville, Ohio and still maintains its corporate headquarters there.
History.
In 1932, William Brooks, joined by his brother F. M. "Mike" Brooks, founded The William Brooks Shoe Company in Nelsonville, Ohio. Both men had lost their jobs during the Great Depression when Godman Shoe Co. of Columbus went bankrupt. In search of opportunity, the brothers set up shop in a rent-free factory with lent equipment and what would eventually become Rocky Brands was born.
The company originally employed 50 to 100 workers with a production rate of 300 pairs of shoes per day. With a newly constructed addition and the installation of more equipment, by the mid-1930s the factory employed 225 people and production output increased to more than 2,000 pairs per day. During the 1940s and 1950s business continued to grow. While supplying more than one million pairs of shoes and boots for military conflicts such as World War II and the Korean War, the company built key relationships with leading footwear retailers.
But in 1958, William Brooks decided to sell the business to the Irving Drew Shoe Company of Lancaster, Ohio. His nephew, John Brooks, who had worked in the plant full-time since age 17, attempted to make a play for the family-run business, but his efforts were rebuffed. William Brooks refused to sell, telling his nephew the shoe industry had no future.
In 1975, the new owners were getting ready to sell or shut down the business. John Brooks, who stayed through the Irving Drew years as plant manager, bought the business back for $640,000, re-establishing The William Brooks Shoe Company in Nelsonville. John Brooks then brought his son, Mike Brooks, into the business as a product designer and manager. In 1977, Mike Brooks won an award for what now is called the original "Rocky boot," and the company paid $1,000 for a trademark and launched the Rocky brand.
As the company struggled in the early 1980s, the shoe market bounced back, and in 1983, the company began marketing occupational shoes, such as those worn by police officers and mail carriers, under the Rocky brand. It opened up new markets and new distribution methods. Sales rose and in 1988, the company reached $20 million in annual revenue.
Two years after the retirement of John Brooks in 1991, his son, Mike Brooks took the company public, spending nearly three-quarters of a million dollars in the process, changing the name to Rocky Shoes & Boots and initiating the company's initial public offering.
Rocky Shoes & Boots acquired EJ Footwear on December 6, 2004 for $87.7 million in cash and roughly $10 million in stock. The move brought Georgia Boot, Durango, and Lehigh Safety Shoes brands into Rocky's fold and added a licensed footwear brand in Dickies. 
In 2006, Rocky Shoes & Boots changed its name to Rocky Brands, Inc. to reflect its growing portfolio. Following the name change Rocky Brands added comfort footwear Zumfoot shoes and Michelin footwear to its ranks.
Philanthropy.
In 2010, Rocky Brands formed the not-for-profit philanthropic organization Rocky Community Improvement Fund (RCIF). The mission of the Rocky Community Improvement Fund, RCIF, is to enhance the quality of life for the people of Nelsonville and the surrounding communities by promoting philanthropy among Rocky Brands associates, building an endowment and awarding grants.
Awards.
Rocky was awarded Footwear Plus magazine's Plus Award in the work footwear category for 2010.

Jimmy Stewart 2007

Jimmy Stewart 2007 is a double live album by progressive rock band Umphrey's McGee. The album was released on June 17, 2008 and consists of some of the band's best improvisational performances from 2007. "What is Jimmy Stewart?" is a brief explanation of their approach to improvisation. The track "Eat - 2.17.07 - San Francisco, California" would become the basis for a new song "Waist Down", debuted on May 24, 2008. A follow-up to the UMLive.net downloads "Jimmy Stewart The Album" and "Jimmy Stewart The Second Album", "JS2007" is the first in the series to be offered in CD form, complete with artwork.
Origins of the album's name.
Umphrey's McGee named their particular improvisational creations "Jimmy Stewarts." The name is derived from that of a meeting room at the Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel. The room was named after the American actor Jimmy Stewart. The band had just played at a wedding for their friend Jeremy Welsh in 2001. The band went back to the meeting room to have a jam session around three o'clock in the morning, and it was recorded by their sound man Kevin Browning. (Pietro C. Truba. (2008, May 15))Bayliss the lead singer said “We had one of the best improv’s we’ve ever had. It was really kind of a different approach to playing that we had never done before and we really liked it.” (Brendan Bayliss, Guitar and vocals) Cinninger said,“So we went down to the concert hall, and barely turned on all the instruments. And kinda sat on the floor really. I think I grabbed my acoustic and we were just barely tapping on things.” “It’s pretty funny, it runs about 30 minutes or so. We get away with literally like tapping on our stuff. It was kinda loosely based there and because of the room, it was called the Jimmy Stewart ballroom or whatever, we decided to christen the name.”(Jake Cinninger Guitarist and vocals). After the jam session in the Jimmy Stewart ballroom, Umphrey's McGee tried to put what they call “Jimmy Stewarts” into every show. "A “Jimmy Stewart" is the specific portion of each show that is set aside for the band's own brand of improvisational music. They also use “Stewarts” as an improvisational exercise for songwriting while on the road. In addition, it serves to seamlessly give fans, as well as the band, something different every night." (brendan bayliss(2008, May 15))
Signals Used By Umphrey's McGee.
When playing at shows, in order to keep themselves in sync while playing improv they have a number of special signals. According to Cinninger, when the band is playing during a concert someone will throw a signal and within 4 beats show another signal and then four beats later they change the flow of the music. According to Cinninger they usually pick who’s going to do what types of sounds so there’s no confusion with how they're going to play. Simple things like a hand wipe will tell the band what to do according on how they planned.(Cinninger) According to band archivist and compiler of the “Jimmy Stewart 2007” album Jon McLennand, there are other signals used during the show. Leaning back, for instance, signals a “bounceback” during which they return to a section they were playing before. This became popular in 2003.
According to (Ryan Stasik Umphrey’s bass player) there is another signal they like to use where he tries to signal that a section is too long; he stops playing, telling the others it’s time to change the style. 
The most important form of communication Umphrey's McGee uses is eye contact. Cinninger compares the members of his band to sheep and shepherds. Usually the person in front controls what everyone is going to do, so the band members watch the leader and follow his signals. However, true to the nature of improvisation, nothing is set in stone. Everyone in the band is constantly watching each other's eyes but there’s not normally more than two people leading. “As long as everyone is making eye contact and looking then we’ll be able to get to where we need to go,” Bayliss adds.
"Typically they use the instrumental interlude of a song as a launching point, and a band member will signal the rest of the band with an unspoken visual cue to signal what to do next. For example, a smile might indicate a major key while a sad face could direct the band to a minor key." Pico (2008, July 17)

Richard Horwood

Richard Horwood (1757/8–1803) was a surveyor and cartographer. In 1795 he published a "Plan of the Cities of London and Westminster the Borough of Southwark and Parts adjoining Shewing every House", at a scale of 26 inches to the mile. At the time this was the largest map ever printed in Britain. After he decided to chart the entire city of London, down to each individual building, Horwood set about soliciting subscriptions to finance the project in 1790. His intention was to publish the complete map within two years, at a scale of 26 inches to the mile. However, the scope of the project was so extensive, and his cost to complete it so high, that rather than taking the estimated two years, the project took almost ten to complete. Despite acquiring royal patronage from King George III, the project suffered financial hardship, making it even more difficult to produce. Despite this, Horwood eventually published the entire map, consisting of 32 sheets. The last sheet was made available in 1799.
Horwood also published a map of Liverpool, the city where he died impoverished in 1803, not long after completing his extensive project.
Modern usage.
Sections of an 1813 edition of the London map are reproduced in Charles Palliser's novel "The Quincunx". The story is set a few years after the publication of the map, which is used by one of the characters. 
A selection of the Horwood maps were used in the publication of "Timbuctoo", a novel based on the adventures of Robert Adams, which includes five large fold-out maps of London.

Iris folding

Iris folding is a paper craft technique that involves folding strips of colored paper in such a way to form a design. The center of the design forms an "iris" — a shape reminiscent of the iris diaphragm of a camera lens.
History.
Iris folding originated in Holland, where early craft persons made their designs using patterned paper cut from the inside of envelopes. Today, crafters use any light weight paper, such as scrapbook paper, origami paper, wrapping paper, the inside of envelopes or pages of magazines. Ribbon is also used.
Techniques.
Iris folding is done with a pattern. The crafter uses the finished product to decorate the front of a greeting card, as a scrapbook embellishment, to decorate an altered book or a mixed media collage, or in various other ways.
Supplies for iris folding include a pattern, strips of colored paper, permanent transparent tape, cutting tools and a temporary tape such as painters tape. The temporary tape is used to hold the pattern in place while the craftperson creates the design.
Iris folding patterns are available from booksellers or as downloadable files made available on Internet web sites. Other craft persons doing iris folding create their own patterns.

<doc id="19964347" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19964347" title="59Fifty">
59Fifty

The 59Fifty is a model of baseball cap made by the New Era Cap Company based in Buffalo, New York. They are often referred to as "Fitted Caps". The 59Fifty is the official on-field cap of Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball, as well as the official sideline cap of the NFL as of 2012. 59Fifty caps are also made for the NHL and NBA. 59Fifty caps are available assorted "custom" colors for sports teams of the aforementioned leagues as well as city names and Marvel Comics and DC Comics character designs. Since its debut in 1954, the 59Fifty has become the standard American baseball cap, as well as a hat industry standard and fashion leader. These caps are distinguished by their high and stiff crowns. Also 59Fifty have popularity globally.
History.
New Era has been making caps for Major League Baseball since 1934, when they provided caps for the Cleveland Indians. Back then (and for several decades after) New Era had to compete with other companies, most of which were the leading sporting goods manufacturers of the time. The 59Fifty officially made its debut in 1954, but 59Fifty on-field caps were not available to the general public until 1978 when New Era placed a mail order advertisement in The Sporting News.
Changes to the 59Fifty over the next several decades were few, but there was some experimentation. During the 1970s and 80s, some teams experimented with nylon fabric as opposed to wool. Leather sweatbands fell out of favor to cloth sweatbands and were phased out by the late 80s. The underside of the visors were traditionally green, but beginning in the 70s, teams slowly switched over to gray. By 1995, all Major League Baseball teams were using gray. The New York Yankees were among the last teams to use green.
In the late 1980s, the suppliers for official MLB on-field caps were narrowed down to two; New Era and Sports Specialties. On-field caps then carried the "Diamond Collection" label from that point on. In 1992, MLB on-field caps began featuring the MLB "batterman" logo on the back of every cap. In 1994, New Era became the exclusive company to supply the official on-field caps of Major League Baseball. That same season, New Era provided bronze "batterman" pins for Major League Baseball's 125th anniversary that players pinned onto the back of their 59Fifty caps. In 1996, New Era began raising the embroidered logos on the 59Fifty. That year, film director Spike Lee requested the first 59Fifty cap that was not an official team color; a red New York Yankees cap. The New Era "flag" logo began appearing on the side of non-MLB on-field caps in 1997.
Beginning in the late 1990s, teams began to experiment with black fabric under the visors to help with the sun's glare, and black sweatbands to make them appear less sweat-stained. The "Diamond Collection" label also changed to the "Authentic Collection". In 2007, New Era changed the 59Fifty significantly. The material changed from wool to polyester, and all teams were now using black fabric under the visor as well as black sweatbands.

<doc id="19964363" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19964363" title="Total system power">
Total system power

Total system power is a term often used in audio electronics to rate the power of an audio system. Total system power refers to the total power consumption of the unit, rather than the power handling of the speakers or the power output of the amplifier. This can be viewed as a somewhat deceptive marketing ploy, as the total power consumption of the unit will of course be greater than any of its other power ratings, except for, perhaps, the peak power of the amplifier, which is essentially an exaggerated value anyway. Shelf stereos and surround sound receivers are often rated using total system power.
One way to use total system power to get a more accurate estimate of power is to consider the amplifier class which would give an educated guess of the power output by considering the efficiency of the class. For example, class AB amplifiers are around 25 or 50% efficiency while Class D amps are much higher; around 80% or more efficiency. A very exceptional efficiency for a specific Class D amp, the ROHM BD5421efs, operates at 90% efficiency. 
In some cases, an audio device may be measured by the "total system power" of all its loudspeakers by adding all their peak power ratings. Many home theater in a box systems are rated this way. Often low-end home theater systems' power ratings are taken at a high level of harmonic distortion as well; as high as 10%, which would be painfully noticeable.

Shelf stereo systems are becoming more popular as their capabilities increase while size decreases. The price of shelf stereo systems are also declining and give consumers a better product for less money. The term may be used to describe systems ranging from a basic, battery-powered boombox to a sophisticated, multi-function high-powered receiver. Shelf stereos are often rated using the total system power in order to "beef-up" their apparent power.
History.
Shelf stereos basically date back to the radio receivers often found in diners ever since the advent of radio; however, these early receivers were not stereophonic receivers, they are the predecessors of shelf stereo.
Today.
In terms of power, many shelf stereo systems are considerably good, many of them having a total system power greater than 500 watts, which is considerably more than many surround sound receivers, which are usually higher in price. Most shelf stereos use either the standard 2 channel format or the 2.1 channel format, with the latter being more common in the higher powered systems. The "point one" indicates the use of a subwoofer along with the two main speakers. However, this is the main difference between shelf stereos and surround sound receivers. Surround sound receivers most commonly utilize 2.1, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 speaker setups that provide true surround sound. Shelf stereos have adapted to new times with many integrating different types of media. Many stereos come with or have the ability to connect: 
The size of today’s shelf stereos have also changed. Many of the popular stereos today are one connected piece as opposed to multiple speakers that separate from a main unit. Among the new one piece shelf stereos are the stand alone iPod speaker system. These systems are made primarily for the use of iPods and utilize an iPod dock.

Dobytown, Nebraska

Dobytown is a ghost town in Kearney County, Nebraska, United States, three miles west of Fort Kearny. Officially named Kearney City, the community was established in 1859. Its common name of "Dobytown" was derived from the resemblance of its twelve to fifteen earthen buildings to adobe structures. Although the community no longer exists, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The site is located at an altitude of 2,129 feet (649 m).
Like many new frontier communities, Dobytown evolved to meet the needs of the thousands of soldiers, traders, teamsters and pioneers traveling west. Gambling, liquor and prostitution were among its main attractions. Dobytown also served as the major outfitting point west of the Missouri River, the center of frontier transportation from 1860 to 1866. A Pony Express station was located in Dobytown and it was the first county seat of Kearney County.
One of Dobytown's most famous visitors, General William Tecumseh Sherman described the horrible whiskey he was served there as "tanglefoot".
The completion of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1869 reduced the travel along the trail and by the fort. The U.S. Army issued an order for abandonment of Fort Kearny on 22 May 1871. This caused Dobytown to be abandoned.

Williams Plains (Bowie, Maryland)

Williams Plains is a historic home located in the White Marsh Recreational Park at Bowie in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States. It is a -story brick house, with a Flemish bond south facade and six-course common bond used for the remaining walls. It is an early- to mid-19th-century brick house which is significant primarily for the Greek Revival–influenced interior decorative detailing which remains almost completely intact and thus is an excellent and somewhat rare record of domestic architecture in Prince George's County in the first half of the 19th century. The dominant design elements which characterize the decorative detailing include Greek Revival influenced trim, mantels, and paneled doors. A much lower -story wing, likely dating to 1942, projects from the northern portion of the east side. The bricks of the wing are laid in stretcher bond, and is a veneer-over-frame construction.
Williams Plains was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Cut-out score

A cut-out score or cutout score is a musical score in which measures with rests are simply omitted, and no rests of any kind are used. Cut-out scores are mostly used for proportional notation scores, such as Penderecki's "Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima". "Proponents of this arrangement argue that it dispenses with needless clutter on the score page," while "others maintain that not enough is gained by this format to justify the extra effort in setting up the score."
Cut-out scores can be created with any full-featured scorewriter, such as Finale or Sibelius. Instead of extracting parts, all the players are given the score.

Tyler Newton

Tyler Isaac Newton (born May 13, 1982 in Utica, New York) is an American professional basketball player who plays for the Rera Kamuy Hokkaido of the Japan Basketball League (JBL Super League). Newton, commonly nicknamed "T-Newt," is tall and plays the power forward position, but is also capable of playing other frontcourt positions like center or small forward.
High school.
Newton attended John Burroughs High School in Burbank, California, where he lettered in volleyball and water polo while earning a scholastic achievement award. Newton began playing organized basketball during his sophomore year in high school, but failed to make the varsity squad and was never used in a game. By his senior year, Newton was scoring career bests of 33 points and 24 rebounds. The big stats were no fluke, as he grabbed 24 rebounds twice during the season and was the fourth leading rebounder in the entire Los Angeles area that year, leading his team to a 17–6 record en route to a league title, and Honorable Mention All-Foothill Conference honors. Newton was inducted into the John Burroughs Middle School Hall of Fame in 2006.
College.
After a season with the Antelope Valley (California) Marauders, Newton transferred to Shasta College in Redding, California, where he led the Knights to a 28–6 record while being named to the All-Conference team and honored as an All-State player.
Newton was recruited by the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California and redshirted during the 2002–2003 season. The next season, Newton averaged 7 points and 4 rebounds per game coming off the bench. Eight of his 10 double-digit scoring efforts came in games in which he did not start, including a 22 point performance in just 16 minutes of action. Newton was voted Most Inspirational by his teammates and earned All-Big West Conference Honorable Mention. The following season, Newton continued his quiet leadership in scoring and rebounding, while helping his team to their second NCAA tournament appearance in as many years.
Professional career.
Newton is an experienced international athlete, having played for teams in countries such as Australia (Hervey Bay Hurricanes), Austria (Allianz Swans Gmunden), France (JDA Dijon Mustard) and Japan (Rera Kamuy Hokkaido). In the United States, he has played with the San Jose Skyrockets and Hollywood Fame of the ABA and the Santa Barbara Breakers of the IBL.
In 2007, Newton was selected as one of two foreign (non-Japanese) players to lead a new Japanese franchise in the city of Sapporo. Newton joined Japanese superstar Takehimo Orimo for the inaugural season of the Rera Kamuy Hokkaido and, after a season of adjustment, they have turned the team into a leading force in the JBL. Newton and his team have the enthusiastic support of local residents, who are excited to have professional basketball in their city. Newton leads his team in scoring (17 points per game), rebounding (12 per game), blocked shots (1.4 per game) and being 4 feet taller than everyone else.
He is also among the JBL League leaders in scoring, field goal percentage, blocked shots and rebounding. His accomplishments were acknowledged in 2007, as he was one of only four foreign (non-Japanese) players to be selected for the JBL League All-Star Game, which featured 24 of the top players in Japan. In 2008, Newton became a two-time All-Star and was the second-leading vote-getter among foreign players. Newton helped lead the East to a 120–98 victory by scoring 18 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in only 18 minutes of play. In the off-season of 2009 he played for the Chico Rage in the highly competitive Sacramento Professional Development League (SPDL) where he averaged 25.8 pts. 8.5 rebs. and 2 blocked shots a game going up against NBA players Donte Greene, Jason Thompson, and Matt Barnes.
Player profile.
Newton is a versatile, all-purpose front court player who mostly plays the power forward position, but has also played center, small forward and point forward throughout his career. Newton is considered one of the best shooters in Japan, hitting over 60 percent of his field goal attempts. Newton briefly struggled with his free throw shooting early in the 2008–09 JBL season. However, by converting 80 percent (12/15) of his free throw attempts against a "Hack-a-Newt" defense by the Mitsubishi Diamond Dolphins, Newton has proven to be a solid free throw shooter as well.
On offense, Newton utilizes his quickness, size, and strength to get past defenders. Newton is known for his exceptional agility and upper body strength, which puts him among the leaders at finishing down low in the paint. He is a solid rebounder who regularly ranks among the league leaders in rebounds. His overall skill sets and on-court play have led to many comparisons to NBA legends Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin McHale, and Kevin Garnett.
Personal life.
During his high school years at John Burroughs High School, Newton was a letterwinner in basketball, water polo, and swimming.

Pseudochromis springeri

"Pseudochromis springeri", also known as Blue-Striped Dottyback, is a popular saltwater aquarium fish from the red sea and eastern Indian ocean.
Appearance.
A small marine fish that reaches two inches in length. It is dark blue or black with blue stripes along its head and fins.
In the Aquarium.
"Pseudochromis springeri" is a hardy member of a saltwater aquarium. As one of the few saltwater fish that can be bred in captivity. Use of tank bred individuals in aquariums is often encouraged to reduce the pressure on wild populations. Twenty gallons is typically quoted as the minimum tank size required to permanently house this fish, although it can be raised in as little as ten gallons with a risk of it harassing any other fish and invertebrates in its tank.
It is less aggressive than most dottybacks but will sometimes harass small, passive, fish and shrimp. It can be quite territorial meaning it is best to only keep one in an aquarium. If more than one is kept in an aquarium it is important that they are added at the same time. Despite its hardy nature, it also must not be placed in an aquarium with larger predatory fish such as lion fish, and grouper which will often see it as a food source.

<doc id="19964537" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19964537" title="Thin-slicing">
Thin-slicing

Thin-slicing is a term used in psychology and philosophy to describe the ability to find patterns in events based only on "thin slices," or narrow windows, of experience. The term seems to have been coined in 1992 by Nalini Ambady and Robert Rosenthal in a paper in the "Psychological Bulletin".
History and overview.
Many studies have shown indication that brief observations can be used to assess outcomes, at levels higher than expected by chance. Once comparing these observations of less than five minutes to greater than five minutes, the data showed no significant change, thus implying that observations made within the first few minutes were unchanging. 
One of the first series conducted by James Bugental and his colleagues showed that parents' expectancies, identified from brief clips of their tone, are related to their children's behavior process. The tone of a mother with a normal child and one whose child has behavioral problems differed significantly. These conceptions provide an underlying basis that there actually is an ability to judge from brief observations. Research in classrooms has shown that judges can distinguish biased teachers from unbiased teachers along with "differential teacher expectancies" simply from brief clips of teachers' behaviors. Likewise, research in the courtroom has shown that in brief excerpts of judges' instructions to jurors in trials, raters could predict the judge's expectations for the trial.
The term thin-slicing means making very quick decisions with minimal amounts of information. Thinking has always been described as a conscious effort. Artist Henri Cartier-Bresson called thinking a "decisive moment" of consciousness, but in reality thin-slicing is an unconscious behavior. Similarly, photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt referred to a direct connection between his eye and his shutter finger, bypassing his brain, which was critical for many of his most celebrated images. Thin-slicing also produces distinct biological and sociocultural effects. In one of Nalini Ambady's experiments, she reminded the female Asian students about their gender or their ethnicity before they took a math test. There are many prevailing social stereotypes that suggest women are not good at math and Asians are good at math. Her study showed that subtly cueing students' gender or ethnic identities affects their performance. The individuals whose ethnicity was cued scored higher than the control group, who in turn scored higher than the students whose gender was cued. See also Priming and Stereotype Threat.
"Blink".
One of the most popular books on thin-slicing is "Blink" written by Malcolm Gladwell. In this book, the author goes through and describes interesting examples and research which exploit the idea of thin-slicing.
Experiments.
Drs. Albrechsten, Meissner and Susa of the University of Texas at El Paso conducted two separate studies of processing style (intuitive vs. deliberative processing) in a deception detection task. In the first experiment, a thin-slicing manipulation was used to show that intuitive processing can lead to more accurate judgments of deception when compared with traditional forms of processing. In the second experiment, participants who engaged in a second task performed more accurately in a deception task than participants who were asked to provide a verbal rationale for each decision. The results converged suggest that intuitive processing can significantly improve deception detection performances. 
Emotions.
An individual's mood and judgments have been known to cause and/or distort cognitive abilities. Studies pertaining to judgments made during these time frames, aids the theory that emotions cloud rational concision thoughts. The three most influential studies were conducted by Nalini Ambady at the Harvard University, Department of Psychology. In the first study, induced sadness led to reduced accuracy in judgments of teacher effectiveness from brief samples of nonverbal behavior. In the second study, sad participants showed reduced accuracy in judging relationship type from thin-slices as well as diminished judgmental efficiency. Study 3 showed the possibility that sadness impairs accuracy by promoting a more deliberative information-processing style. All of these studies have the basic principle that emotions do in fact affect judgement as seen through effects on thin-slicing.
Examples in everyday life.
Some people may believe that the effects of the phenomenon known as "déjà vu" happen within the same time frame of thin-slicing and might also have a direct correlation.
Many other uses of thin-slicing are implied and seen throughout the media such as firemen making split-second decisions, or cops knowing something is wrong by simply a gut feeling. All these imply and show that thin-slicing actually occurs and is a fact of life that actually occurs within everyone.

He retired as a Major-General in 1882. Lempriere surveyed the route from Hope to Lytton via the Coquihalla River in 1859.
Mount Lempriere in the North Thompson region of the British Columbia Interior, between Kamloops and Tete Jaune Cache-Valemount, was named after him by 1917. A Canadian National Railway railway point in this area was also named Lempriere, where there was a post office from 1942 to 1945 when Japanese were interned at a work camp in this area.

Akab Dzib

The Akab Dzib is a pre-Columbian structure at the Maya archaeological site of Chichen Itza, located in the central-northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula of present-day Mexico.
The building is formally catalogued in archaeological surveys as Chichen Itza Structure 4D1; alternative spellings include Akab Tzib and Akabdzib. In modern Maya orthography, the building's given name renders as ' or '. 
"Akab Dzib" means, in Mayan, "The House of Mysterious Writing". An earlier name of the building, according to a translation of glyphs in the Casa Colorada, is "Wa(k)wak Puh Ak Na", "the flat house with the excessive number of chambers” and it was the home of the administrator of Chichén Itzá, kokom Yahawal Cho' K’ak’. 
The INAH completed a restoration of the building in 2007. It is relatively short, only high, and is in length and wide. The long, western-facing facade has seven doorways. The eastern facade has only four doorways, broken by a large staircase that leads to the roof. This apparently was the front of the structure, and looks out over what is today a steep, but dry, "cenote". The southern end of the building has one entrance. The door opens into a small chamber and on the opposite wall is another doorway, above which on the lintel are intricately carved glyphs—the “mysterious” or “obscure” writing that gives the building its name today. Under the lintel in the door jamb is another carved panel of a seated figure surrounded by more glyphs. Inside one of the chambers, near the ceiling, is a painted hand print.

Pseudochromis steenei

"Pseudochromis steenei", also known as Lyretail Dottyback, is a saltwater fish from Indonesia that is occasionally kept in aquariums.
Appearance.
A small marine fish that reaches five inches in length. Males are grey with a bright orange head, while females are dark grey.
In the Aquarium.
"Pseudochromis steenei" is a hardy member of a saltwater aquarium. As one of the few saltwater aquarium fish that can be bred in captivity use of tank bred individuals in aquariums is often encouraged to reduce the pressure on wild populations.
Twenty five gallons is typically quoted as the minimum tank size required to permanently house this fish. It is best to house them in a species tank, or aquariums greater than a hundred gallons however or they may bother other species persistently. Because it typically ignores invertebrates it is considered reef safe, although it will sometimes attack shrimp.
It is more aggressive than most, and perhaps all, dottybacks and will often attack other fish and even people. It can be particularly territorial with members of its own species meaning it is best to only keep one in an aquarium. Despite its hardy nature, it should not be placed in an aquarium with larger predatory fish such as lionfish, and grouper which may see it as a food source.

Samuel Crowell

Samuel Crowell was a ship-captain and fur trader in the late 18th Century on the Pacific Northwest Coast. Crowell was master of the "Hancock", a brig owned by Messrs. Crowell and Creeighton of Boston, Massachusetts, which left Boston in November 1790 and arrived on the Northwest Coast in July of the following year, spending a good time of the season trading in the area of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Crowell and his men built the first European-type vessel to be constructed on the Charlottes, a tender for the "Hancock", doing so on Maast Island which lies off the native village of Masset. Crowell and his vessel are believd to have been the first non-indigenous vessel to penetrate Masset Sound. Crowell and the "Hancock" sailed to China in the fall of 1791 and, after selling her cargo of furs there, returned twice more to the Islands, in 1792 and 1793.
Crowell Rock, near Moresby Island in the southern Queen Charlottes, and Crowell Point, near Masset, are named after him. Hancock Point, also on southern Moresby, was named for his ship.

David Henderson is a Christchurch, New Zealand based property developer.
In 1994 he founded the libertarian magazine the "Free Radical". He was also a student of Zenith Applied Philosophy, "It really sparked my interest. I found it greatly stimulating and inspiring, immensely so. They got a terribly bad name, a bad rap."
From 1992 to 1995 he was audited 27 times after claiming a GST refund and the Inland Revenue Department demanded he pay $NZ924,341 in taxes and penalties. He was charged with fraud, his business failed and he was bankrupted and had to sell his house. The IRD eventually conceded that he did not owe it $NZ924,341, and fraud charges against him were dropped. They also admitted that they owed him $NZ64,000.This experience led him to write a book "Be Very Afraid: One Man’s Stand Against the IRD". In 2007 his story was made into a film by South Pacific Pictures, entitled "We're Here To Help".
Henderson's company, Property Ventures Limited is currently undertaking a number of developments including the billion dollar new town, Five Mile, in Queenstown.
In November 2007 saw the opening in Christchurch of a new style of hotel named HotelSO. This building, acquired by Henderson in 2004, was occupied by the Inland Revenue Department.
Applications were made in the High Court at Christchurch on 16 May 2008 to have Mr Henderson's Five Mile Holdings and Property Ventures placed in liquidation. 
In early August 2008, the Christchurch City Council held a short-notice urgent meeting about sensitive central city property purchases, then on 8 August 2008 announced that it would buy five of Henderson's properties for approximately $NZ17 million. Henderson was to have first option to buy back the properties. This decision caused much civic controversy.
The High Court in Christchurch placed Henderson in bankruptcy on 29 November 2010.

Lampropeltis triangulum gaigeae

Lampropeltis triangulum gaigeae, commonly known as the black milk snake, is a nonvenomous subspecies of milk snake. It is the largest known milk snake. Black milk snakes are found in the mountains of Costa Rica and Panama. 
Description.
Hatchlings black milk snakes are between 12 and 16 inches in length. They are red, black, and white or yellow as hatchlings. When they are between 6 and 10 months of age, the black milk snakes will begin to change colors, and start to turn black as they grow to adulthood. 
Adult black milk snakes average between 48 - 76 inches (4 feet - 6 feet 4 inches), but some have been known to grow up to 7 feet in length.
Geographic range.
Black milk snakes are native to Costa Rica and Panama. They typically live in the wet, high mountain cloud forests at elevations between 5,000 and 7,400 feet in Costa Rica, and 4,300 - 6,500 feet in Panama. 
Diet.
Black milk snakes typically eat mice, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, reptile eggs, birds, and bird eggs in the wild. 
Captivity.
Black milk snakes can make excellent pets for many people. They are typically very hardy snakes in captivity. As hatchlings they will readily accept mice, and as adults may consume medium-sized rats. Since they dwell in high elevations in the wild, they do well with their temperatures between 72 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit. If they are kept at temperatures between 80 - 85 degrees, they metabolize their food much more quickly than other colubrids, and can become overweight very easily.

<doc id="19964876" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19964876" title="Digital mapping">
Digital mapping

Digital mapping (also called digital cartography) is the process by which a collection of data is compiled and formatted into a virtual image. The primary function of this technology is to produce maps that give accurate representations of a particular area, detailing major road arteries and other points of interest. The technology also allows the calculation of distances from once place to another. 
Though digital mapping can be found in a variety of computer applications, such as Google Earth, the main use of these maps is with the Global Positioning System, or GPS satellite network, used in standard automotive navigation systems.
History.
From Paper to Paperless.
The roots of digital mapping lie within traditional paper maps such as the Thomas Guide. Paper maps provide basic landscapes similar to digitized road maps, yet are often cumbersome, cover only a designated area, and lack many specific details such as road blocks. In addition, there is no way to “update” a paper map except to obtain a new version. On the other hand, digital maps, in many cases, can be updated through synchronization with updates from company servers.
Expanded Capabilities.
Early digital maps had the same basic functionality as paper maps—that is, they provided a “virtual view” of roads generally outlined by the terrain encompassing the surrounding area. However, as digital maps have grown with the expansion of GPS technology in the past decade, live traffic updates, points of interest and service locations have been added to enhance digital maps to be more “user conscious." Traditional “virtual views” are now only part of digital mapping. In many cases, users can choose between virtual maps, satellite (aerial views), and hybrid (a combination of virtual map and aerial views) views. With the ability to update and expand digital mapping devices, newly constructed roads and places can be added to appear on maps.
Data Collection.
Digital maps heavily rely upon a vast amount of data collected over time. Most of the information that comprise digital maps is the culmination of satellite imagery as well as street level information. Maps must be updated frequently to provide users with the most accurate reflection of a location. While there is a wide spectrum on companies that specialize in digital mapping, the basic premise is that digital maps will accurately portray roads as they actually appear to give "life-like experiences." 
Functionality and Use.
Computer Applications.
Computer programs and applications such as Google Earth and Google Maps provide map views from space and street level of much of the world. Used primarily for recreational use, Google Earth provides digital mapping in personal applications, such as tracking distances or finding locations.
Scientific Applications.
The development of mobile computing (PDAs, tablet PCs, laptops, etc.) has recently (since about 2000) spurred the use of digital mapping in the sciences and applied sciences. As of 2009, science fields that use digital mapping technology include geology (see Digital geologic mapping), engineering, architecture, land surveying, mining, forestry, environmental, and archaeology.
GPS Navigation Systems.
The principle use by which digital mapping has grown in the past decade has been its connection to Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. GPS is the foundation behind digital mapping navigation systems.
How It Works.
The coordinates and position as well as atomic time obtained by a terrestrial GPS receiver from GPS satellites orbiting Earth interact together to provide the digital mapping programming with points of origin in addition to the destination points needed to calculate distance. This information is then analyzed and compiled to create a map that provides the easiest and most efficient way to reach a destination.

Milk and Alcohol

"Milk and Alcohol" is a song by the band Dr. Feelgood, that reached number nine in the UK Singles Chart in 1979. Written by Nick Lowe and Gypie Mayo, and produced by Richard Gottehrer, the song was Dr. Feelgood's biggest hit and continues to be played by the band.
History.
"Milk and Alcohol", written in 1978 by Nick Lowe and John "Gypie" Mayo, reportedly retells Lowe's 1970s experiences drinking one too many Kahlúa-milk drinks at or after a United States concert by bluesman John Lee Hooker. However, while the song anonymously criticises Hooker ("Main attraction dead on his feet, Black man rhythm with a white boy beat"), ironically it was inspired by Hooker's own lyric about "milk, cream and alcohol". The song was recorded in 1978 and first appeared on "Private Practice", an album by Dr. Feelgood that was released in October 1978. The heavy riffs on "Milk and Alcohol" were added by Mayo, a guitarist who replaced Wilko Johnson in 1978, after Johnson left the band as a result of an argument over the recording of Dr. Feelgood's fourth album, "Sneakin' Suspicion" (1977).
"Milk and Alcohol" was released as a single in January 1979. The vinyl material of the single record was issued in the three colours of black, white and brown, with the white and brown meant to call to mind white milk and brown alcohol. The outline of a Kahlúa bottle appears on the record sleeve. The background around the bottle on the different record sleeves was varied to match the vinyl colour.
The song reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart in the same month it was released. The track reached number nine in the United Kingdom chart, in part due to the song's reference to the milk and alcohol drink, and spent nine weeks in the listing. Capitalizing on the notoriety the song brought, the band presented "Milk and Alcohol" live to audiences around the world in 1979, including in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, Russia and the United States.
Impact.
"Milk and Alcohol" was the band's fourth hit single in the United Kingdom, and their only Top 10 single in the UK Singles Chart. In 1979, the musical world was perceived as being dominated by "fey glam-rockers and 15-minute Mellotron solos." When "Milk and Alcohol" was played in the pubs of Canvey Island in the late 1970s, the song came across as a radical departure that contributed to "a short, sharp shock of roots rock." For a while, the song led to some drinking both alcohol and milk while listing to Dr. Feelgood perform live.
In April 1989, a remixed "Milk and Alcohol (New Recipe)" was issued by EMI in both 7" vinyl ((EM 89) with "She's Got Her Eyes on You" as the B-side); and 12" vinyl ((12 EM 89) with "She's Got Her Eyes on You" and "Mad Man Blues" on the B-side).
In 1997, "Milk and Alcohol" continued to be played by the band while making the rounds of the world's pubs, clubs and concert halls. However, by 2003, "Milk and Alcohol" was seen as a "forgotten gem" and was listed at number nine on "Moozak Top Ten", a tongue-in-cheek "cow music" listing that included entries such as "Bovinian Rhapsody", a wordplay on the popular 1975 song "Bohemian Rhapsody," and "You Can Cull Me Al", a wordplay on "You Can Call Me Al." With the band continuing to present the song in concerts, the music community regained respect for the song. In 2005, the band's biggest hit was being called a "classic." In that same year, "Milk and Alcohol" was considered by the music magazine "Q" in its compilation of the top ten cigarettes and alcohol songs for the ultimate soundtrack to a drinking session, but lost out to the 1987 song "Nightrain" by the American rock band, Guns N' Roses. Mayo's guitar performance on "Milk and Alcohol", which ranked as number four on a 2005 list of the top ten great British guitar heroes, was cited in that same listing for waking "a generation of guitarists up to the sheer power and energy" of the guitar.
Three decades after reaching the UK's top ten, "Milk and Alcohol" continues to be a popular choice for the band during its concerts.

Clem Beddow

Jonathon Harry "Clem" Beddow (born October 1885, deceased) was an English footballer. His regular position was as a forward. He was born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire. He played for Trent Rovers, Burton United, Manchester United and Burnley.
Football career.
Beddow started his career in amateur football with Trent Rovers before joining Football League Second Division side Burton United in 1904. After making 21 league appearances and scoring twice for Burton during the 1904–05 season, he signed for rival Second Division club Manchester United in February 1905. Beddow made his debut for the club on 25 February 1905 in the goalless draw away at Barnsley. He scored his first goal for Manchester United in the 6–0 win against Doncaster Rovers on 1 April 1905 at Old Trafford. During the 1905–06 season he netted 11 goals, including a hat-trick against Grimsby Town in the 5–0 victory on 6 January 1906. Beddow also scored a hat-trick the following week as United progressed to the Second Round of the FA Cup with a 7–2 home win over non-League outfit Staple Hill.
The three goals in the FA Cup tie turned out to be Beddow's last for Manchester United. Following the side's promotion to the First Division for the 1906–07 season, he played only sparingly. In July 1907 he returned to the Second Division, joining Burnley on a free transfer. Beddow played his first competitive game for his new club in the first match of the 1907–08 season, a 0–5 defeat away to West Bromwich Albion. The following week, he scored twice as Burnley secured a 3–1 win against Stoke at Turf Moor. After losing his place in the team for a short period, Beddow netted twice on his return as Burnley won 3–2 away at Barnsley on 19 October. During November, he scored in consecutive matches against Grimsby Town and Oldham Athletic. However, he was dropped for the game against Stockport County on 14 December in favour of young William Short, making his senior debut. Beddow did not appear again for Burnley that season, unable to displace first Alex Leake and later Frederick Whittaker from the starting eleven.
Beddow struggled to force his way back into the first team in the 1908–09 campaign, making just two league appearances without scoring. The following season he was used only once, selected at right outside forward ahead of Jonathan Morley for the visit of Hull City on 8 September 1909. However, Burnley were beaten by a single goal and youngster George Clarke was picked for the next match, and Beddow left the club shortly afterwards.

Sea-level curve

The sea-level curve is the representation of the changes of the sea level throughout the geological history.
The first such curve is the Vail curve or Exxon curve. The names of the curve refer to the fact that in 1977 a team of Exxon geologists from Esso Production Research headed by Peter Vail published a monograph on global eustatic sea-level changes. Their sea-level curve was based on seismic and biostratigraphic data accumulated during petroleum exploration.
The Vail curve (and the monograph itself) was the subject of debate among geologists, because it was based on undisclosed commercially confidential stratigraphic data, and hence not independently verifiable. Because of this, there were later efforts to establish a sea-level curve based on non-commercial data.
In 1987–1988 a revised eustatic sea-level curve for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras was published, now known as the Haq sea-level curve, in reference to the Pakistani-American Oceanographer Bilal Haq.

Career.
Born in Cowdenbeath, Bissett played for Glencraig Thistle and Third Lanark prior to the First World War in his native Scotland before moving to Manchester United in 1919. He made his Football League debut on 15 November 1919 in a 1–0 loss at Burnley and remained at Old Trafford for two years, scoring 10 goals in 42 appearances.
In November 1921, he transferred to Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he made his debut on 3 December 1921 in a 2–0 win at Port Vale. He remained a first choice player for the remainder of the season, scoring nine times in 29 games. However, the appointment of George Jobey as manager during the 1922–23 season saw Bissett's opportunities decline and he featured only sporadically in that campaign.
He left to join Welsh League club Pontypridd in January 1924, but moved to Southend United four months later before retiring in 1926. He died in 1946.

The Play of the Week

Play of the Week is an American anthology series of televised stage plays which aired in NTA Film Network syndication from October 12, 1959 to May 1, 1961.
Ambitious undertaking.
The series presented 67 (35 in the first season, 32 in the second) videotaped Broadway-style productions, broadcast nightly and Sunday afternoons on New York City's independent, WNTA Channel 13, which served as NTA's flagship station, and at varying times and days on the approximately 100 other stations affiliated with NTA. Because well-known performers were willing to accept minimum payments (top salary was $750) for the prestige of appearing in the critically praised showcase, production costs were kept to an average of $40,000. Although the budget was low, the show had a high distinction which, combined with its reputation as an innovative production, gave it momentum and propelled it into winning a Peabody Award.

William "Billy" Grassam (born 20 November 1878; date of death unknown) was a Scottish footballer who played as a forward.
Playing career.
Grassam played for Scottish Junior Football Association sides Redcliffe Thistle and Maryhill before joining English side Burslem Port Vale in July 1899. He scored three goals in the opening five Second Division fixtures of the 1899–1900 campaign, and finished the season with ten goals in 41 games. In the summer of 1900 he moved on to West Ham United of the Southern League. On 1 September 1900, he became the first West Ham player to score a hat-trick, when he scored four goals on his debut against Gravesend United. The club finished sixth in 1900–01. He finished as the club's joint-top scorer (with George Ratcliffe) in 1901–02 with ten goals. After West Ham finished tenth in 1902–03, Grassam returned to Scotland with Celtic.
In September 1903, he went back to England to join Manchester United and scored 11 goals in 23 games in his first season with the club, becoming joint-top scorer in the league (with Billy Griffiths and Tommy Arkesden). However, he fell out of favour the following season, contributing just two goals in six league games, before moving on to Leyton in July 1905. He rejoined West Ham later that year, where he built up a solid partnership with Harry Stapley. The Boleyn Ground outfit finished 11th in 1905–06, 5th in 1906–07, 10th in 1907–08, 17th in 1908–09, and 9th in 1909–10. Having lost his first-team place to Danny Shea, Grassam moved on to league rivals Brentford in 1910. He was the second-highest goal scorer of the period for the "Hammers" behind Shea, before the club joined the Football League in 1919.

Leonard Cohen

Leonard Norman Cohen, (born 21 September 1934) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, musician, poet, and novelist. His work has explored religion, politics, isolation, sexuality, and personal relationships. Cohen has been inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, Cohen received a Prince of Asturias Award for literature.
The critic Bruce Eder assessed Cohen's overall career in popular music by asserting that "is one of the most fascinating and enigmatic … singer/songwriters of the late '60s … has retained an audience across four decades of music-making … Second only to Bob Dylan (and perhaps Paul Simon) [in terms of influence, he commands the attention of critics and younger musicians more firmly than any other musical figure from the 1960s who is still working at the outset of the 21st century."
The Academy of American Poets has commented more broadly on Cohen's overall career in the arts, including his work as a poet, novelist, and songwriter, stating that "[Cohen's] successful blending of poetry, fiction, and music is made most clear in "Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs", published in 1993, which gathered more than 200 of Cohen's poems … several novel excerpts, and almost 60 song lyrics … While it may seem to some that Leonard Cohen departed from the literary in pursuit of the musical, his fans continue to embrace him as a Renaissance man who straddles the elusive artistic borderlines."
Early life.
Cohen was born on 21 September 1934 in Westmount, an English-speaking area of Montreal, Quebec, into a middle-class Jewish family. His mother, Marsha (Masha) Klonitsky, was the daughter of a Talmudic writer, Rabbi Solomon Klonitsky-Kline of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry. His paternal grandfather, whose family had emigrated from Poland, was Lyon Cohen, founding president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. His father, Nathan Cohen, who owned a substantial clothing store, died when Cohen was nine years old. On the topic of being a Kohen, Cohen has said that, "I had a very Messianic childhood." He told Richard Goldstein in 1967, "I was told I was a descendant of Aaron, the high priest."
Cohen attended Roslyn Elementary School and, from 1948, Westmount High School, where he was involved with the student council and studied music and poetry. He became especially interested in the poetry of Federico Garcia Lorca. As a teenager, he learned to play the guitar, and formed a country-folk group called the Buckskin Boys. Although he initially played a regular acoustic guitar, he soon switched to playing a classical guitar after meeting a young Spanish flamenco guitar player who taught him "a few chords and some flamenco."
Cohen frequented Saint-Laurent Boulevard where he went for fun, and ate at places such as the Main Deli Steak House. According to journalist David Sax, the Main Deli was where Cohen and one of his cousins would go to "...watch the gangsters, pimps, and wrestlers dance around the night." Cohen also enjoyed visiting the previously raucous bars of Old Montreal as well as Saint Joseph's Oratory, which had the closest restaurant near Westmount where he and his friend Mort Rosengarten could go for coffee and a smoke. After moving out of Westmount, Cohen purchased a place in the previous working-class neighborhood of Montreal's Little Portugal on Saint-Laurent Boulevard where he read his poetry at various surrounding clubs. It is also during his time there in the small neighborhood that he wrote the lyrics to what would become some of his most famous songs.
Poetry and novels.
In 1951, Cohen enrolled at McGill University, where he became president of the McGill Debating Union and won the Chester MacNaghten Literary Competition for the poems "Sparrows" and "Thoughts of a Landsman". Cohen published his first poems in March 1954 in the magazine "CIV/n". The issue also included poems by Cohen's poet-professors (who were also on the editorial board), Irving Layton and Louis Dudek. Cohen graduated from McGill the following year with a B.A. degree. His literary influences during this time included William Butler Yeats, Irving Layton (who taught political science at McGill and became both Cohen's mentor and friend), Walt Whitman, Federico Garcia Lorca, and Henry Miller. His first published book of poetry, "Let Us Compare Mythologies" (1956), was published by Dudek as the first book in the McGill Poetry Series the year after Cohen's graduation. The book contained "poems written largely when Cohen was between the ages of fifteen and twenty", and Cohen dedicated the book to his late father. The well-known Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye wrote a review of the book in which he gave Cohen "restrained praise".
After completing his undergraduate degree, Cohen spent a term in McGill's law school and then a year (1956–1957) at the School of General Studies at Columbia University. Cohen described his graduate school experience as "passion without flesh, love without climax". Consequently, Cohen left New York and returned to Montreal in 1957, working various odd jobs and focusing on the writing of fiction and poetry, including the poems for his next book, "The Spice-Box of Earth" (1961), which was the first book that Cohen published through the Canadian publishing company McClelland & Stewart. Fortunately for Cohen, his father's will provided him with a modest trust income, sufficient to allow him to pursue his literary ambitions for the time, and "The Spice-Box of Earth" was successful in helping to expand the audience for Cohen's poetry, helping him reach out to the poetry scene in Canada, outside the confines of McGill University. The book also helped Cohen gain critical recognition as an important new voice in Canadian poetry. One of Cohen's biographers, Ira Nadel, stated that "reaction to the finished book was enthusiastic and admiring...the critic Robert Weaver found it powerful and declared that Cohen was 'probably the best young poet in English Canada right now.'"
Cohen continued to write poetry and fiction throughout much of the 1960s and preferred to live in quasi-reclusive circumstances after he bought a house on Hydra, a Greek island in the Saronic Gulf. While living and writing on Hydra, Cohen published the poetry collection "Flowers for Hitler" (1964), and the novels "The Favourite Game" (1963) and "Beautiful Losers" (1966). His novel "The Favourite Game" was an autobiographical "bildungsroman" about a young man who discovers his identity through writing. "Beautiful Losers" received a good deal of attention from the Canadian press and stirred up controversy because of a number of sexually graphic passages. In 1966 Cohen also published "Parasites of Heaven", a book of poems. Both "Beautiful Losers" and "Parasites of Heaven" received mixed reviews and sold few copies.
Subsequently, Cohen published less, with major gaps, concentrating more on recording songs. In 1978, he published his first book of poetry in many years, "Death of a Lady's Man" (not to be confused with the album he released the previous year with the similar title, "Death of a Ladies' Man"). It wasn't until 1984 that Cohen published his next book of poems, "Book of Mercy", which won him the Canadian Authors Association Literary Award for Poetry. The book contains 50 prose-poems, influenced by the Hebrew Bible and Zen writings. Cohen himself referred to the pieces as "prayers". In 1993, Cohen published "Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs", and in 2006, after 10 years of delays, additions and rewritings, "Book of Longing". "The Book of Longing" is dedicated to the poet Irving Layton. Also, during the late 1990s and 2000s, many of Cohen's new poems and lyrics were first published on the fan website The Leonard Cohen Files, including the original version of the poem "A Thousand Kisses Deep" (which Cohen later adapted for a song).
Cohen's writing process, as he told an interviewer in 1998, is "like a bear stumbling into a beehive or a honey cache: I'm stumbling right into it and getting stuck, and it's delicious and it's horrible and I'm in it and it's not very graceful and it's very awkward and it's very painful and yet there's something inevitable about it".
In 2011, Cohen was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for literature.
Recording career.
1960s and '70s.
In 1967, disappointed with his lack of financial success as a writer, Cohen moved to the United States to pursue a career as a folk music singer-songwriter. During the 1960s, he was a fringe figure in Andy Warhol's "Factory" crowd. Warhol speculated that Cohen had spent time listening to Nico in clubs and that this had influenced his musical style. His song "Suzanne" became a hit for Judy Collins and was for many years his most covered song. After performing at a few folk festivals, he came to the attention of Columbia Records representative John H. Hammond who signed Cohen to a record deal.
Cohen's first album was "Songs of Leonard Cohen" (1967). Although Hammond was originally supposed to produce the record, he was ill and was replaced by the producer John Simon. Simon and Cohen clashed over instrumentation and mixing; Cohen wanted the album to have a spare sound, while Simon felt the songs could benefit from arrangements that included strings and horns. According to biographer Ira Nadel, although Cohen was able to make changes to the mix, some of Simon's additions "couldn't be removed from the four-track master tape." Nevertheless, the album became a cult favorite in the US, as well as in the UK, where it spent over a year on the album charts. Several of the songs on that first album were covered by other popular folk artists, including James Taylor and Judy Collins.
Cohen followed up that first album with "Songs from a Room" (1969) (featuring the often-recorded "Bird on the Wire") and "Songs of Love and Hate" (1971). Both of these albums were produced in Nashville by producer Bob Johnston, who helped Cohen achieve the sparer sound that he'd been after on his first album; Johnston also joined Cohen on two subsequent live tours, playing organ and piano.
In 1970, Cohen toured for the first time, with dates in the United States, Canada and Europe, and appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival. He toured again in Europe and Israel in 1972 with some of the same band-mates, including Charlie Daniels and his producer, Bob Johnston; the band was nicknamed "The Army". Both tours were represented on the "Live Songs" LP. "Leonard Cohen Live at the Isle of Wight 1970" was released in 2009. The 1972 tour was also filmed by Tony Palmer under the title "Bird on a Wire" which was shown re-cut under Cohen's guidance in 1974 but only released to the public in 2010, reconstructed according to Palmer's original version.
In 1971, the film director Robert Altman featured the songs "The Stranger Song", "Winter Lady", and "Sisters of Mercy" (all from Cohen's debut album "Songs of Leonard Cohen") on the soundtrack for his Western film "McCabe & Mrs. Miller".
Beginning around 1974, Cohen's collaboration with pianist and arranger John Lissauer created a live sound praised by the critics. They toured together in 1974 in Europe, and in US and Canada in late 1974 and early 1975, in support of Cohen's record "New Skin for the Old Ceremony", which was produced and arranged by Lissauer. In late 1975 Cohen and Lissauer performed a short series of shows in the US and Canada with a new band, in support of Cohen's "Best Of" release. The tour included new songs from an album in progress, co-written by Cohen and Lissauer and entitled "Songs for Rebecca". However, none of the recordings from these live tours with Lissauer were ever officially released, and the album was abandoned in 1976 (however, some of the songs that were meant for "Songs for Rebecca" were later rewritten by Cohen with Phil Spector for Cohen's 1977 album "Death of a Ladies' Man").
In 1976 Cohen, without Lissauer, embarked on a new major European tour with a new band and changes in his sound and arrangements, again, in support of his "The Best of Leonard Cohen" release (in Europe retitled as "Greatest Hits"). Laura Branigan was one of his back-up singers during the tour, and the set-list included the unreleased songs "Everybody's Child" (a.k.a. "Blessed Is the Memory") and "Storeroom" (both released as bonus tracks to 2007 reissue of "Songs of Leonard Cohen"), and the new song "Do I Have to Dance All Night?" (which was released as a single with the song "The Butcher" in a single available in Europe only). From April to July, Cohen gave 55 shows, including his first appearance at the famous Montreux Jazz Festival.
After the European tour of 1976, Cohen again attempted a new change in his style and arrangements; his new 1977 record, "Death of a Ladies' Man" (one year later, in 1978, Cohen also released a volume of poetry with the coyly revised title, "Death of a Lady's Man"), was co-written and produced by Phil Spector, known as the inventor of the "Wall of Sound" technique, which backs up pop music with many layers of instrumentation, an approach very different from Cohen's usually minimalist instrumentation. The recording of the album was fraught with difficulty—Spector reportedly mixed the album in secret studio sessions, and Cohen said Spector once threatened him with a crossbow. Cohen thought the end result "grotesque", but also "semi-virtuous". The record was released by Spector's label, Warner, and was returned to Columbia's Cohen catalogue in the late 1980s. Cohen did not take part in the album's promotion, but in his tours of 1979, 1980 and 1985, he performed two songs from the album, "Memories" and "Iodine". However, Cohen chose not to include any of the album's songs on his later compilations "More Best of Leonard Cohen" and "The Essential Leonard Cohen".
In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional "Recent Songs", which blended his acoustic style with jazz and Oriental and Mediterranean influences. Beginning with this record, praised in 2001 by Cohen as his favourite, Cohen began to co-produce his albums. Produced by Cohen and Henry Lewy (Joni Mitchell's sound engineer), "Recent Songs" included performances by Passenger, an Austin-based jazz-fusion band that met Cohen through Mitchell. The band helped Cohen create a new sound by featuring instruments like the oud, the Gypsy violin and the mandolin. The album was supported by Cohen's major tour with the new band, and Jennifer Warnes and Sharon Robinson on the backing vocals, in Europe in late 1979, and again in Australia, Israel and Europe in 1980. The tour was filmed by Harry Rasky as "The Song of Leonard Cohen", and the film was broadcast on television in 1980. Cohen also gave a couple of major TV appearances in 1979, including German's ZDF television. In 2000 Columbia released an album of live recordings of songs from the 1979 tour, entitled ""; the album (with a different track list) was originally rejected by the label in 1980.
During the 1970s, Cohen toured twice with Jennifer Warnes as a back-up singer (1972 and 1979). Warnes would become a fixture on Cohen's future albums, receiving full co-vocals credit on Cohen's 1985 album "Various Positions" (although the record was released under Cohen's name, the inside credits say "Vocals by Leonard Cohen and Jennifer Warnes"). In 1987, she recorded an album of Cohen songs, "Famous Blue Raincoat".
1980s.
In the early 1980s, Cohen co-wrote the rock musical film "Night Magic" with Lewis Furey, starring Carole Laure and Nick Mancuso (voice-over by Furey); the LP was released in 1985. Lissauer produced Cohen's next record "Various Positions," which was released in December 1984 (and in January and February 1985 in various European countries). The LP included "Dance Me to the End of Love", which was promoted by Cohen's first video clip, directed by French photographer Dominique Issermann, and the frequently covered "Hallelujah". Cohen supported the release of the album with his biggest tour to date, in Europe and Australia, and with his first tour in Canada and United States since 1975, although Columbia declined to release the album in the United States where it was pressed in small number of copies by the independent Passport Records. Anjani Thomas, who would become Cohen's partner, and a regular member of Cohen's recording team, joined his touring band. The band performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival, and the Roskilde Festival. They also gave a series of highly emotional and politically controversial concerts in Poland, which was under martial law and performed the song "The Partisan", regarded as the hymn of the Polish Solidarity movement. During the 80s, almost all of Cohen's songs were performed in Polish language by Maciej Zembaty.
In 1986, Cohen appeared in the episode "French Twist" of the TV series "Miami Vice." In 1987, Jennifer Warnes's tribute album "Famous Blue Raincoat" helped restore Cohen's career in the US. The following year he released "I'm Your Man," which marked a drastic change in his music. Synthesizers ruled the album and Cohen's lyrics included more social commentary and dark humor. The album, self-produced by Cohen, remains one of Cohen's most acclaimed albums, and was promoted by iconic black and white video shot by Dominique Issermann at the beach of Normandy. Cohen supported the record with series of television interviews, and an extensive tour of Europe, Canada and US. Many shows were broadcast on European and US television and radio stations, while Cohen performed for the first time in his career on PBS's Austin City Limits show; he also performed at the Roskilde Festival again, among other dates. The tour gave the basic structure to typical Cohen's three-hours two-acts concert which he used in his tours in 1993, 2008–10 and 2012. The selection of performances from the late 1980s was released in 1994 on "Cohen Live". None of the concerts was released in its entirety, although some were bootlegged. Parts of one of three Royal Albert Hall concerts were used in BBC documentary "The Songs from the Life of Leonard Cohen", which was released on laser disc and video tape.
"Hallelujah".
"Hallelujah" was first released on Cohen's studio album "Various Positions" in 1984. The song had limited initial success but found greater popularity through a 1991 cover by John Cale which formed the basis for a later cover by Jeff Buckley. "Hallelujah" has been performed by almost 200 artists in various languages. Statistics from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); the Canadian Recording Industry Association; the Australian Recording Industry Association; and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry show more than five million copies of the song sold prior to late 2008 in compact-disc format. It has been the subject of a BBC Radio documentary and been featured in the soundtracks of numerous films and television programs.
The song is the subject of the book "The Holy or the Broken: Leonard Cohen, Jeff Buckley & the Unlikely Ascent of 'Hallelujah'" (2012) by Alan Light. In a "New York Times" review Janet Maslin praised the book and the song, noting that "Cohen spent years struggling with his song 'Hallelujah.' . . . He wrote perhaps as many as 80 verses before paring the song down and recording it on the 1984 album "Various Positions". His label, CBS Records, refused to release "Various Positions", not realizing that 'Hallelujah' would become one of the most haunting, mutable and oft-performed songs in American musical history."
1990s.
The use of the album track "Everybody Knows" from "I'm Your Man" in the 1990 film "Pump Up the Volume" helped expose Cohen's music to a younger audience. The song also featured prominently in fellow Canadian Atom Egoyan's 1994 film, "Exotica". In 1992, Cohen released "The Future", which urges (often in terms of biblical prophecy) perseverance, reformation, and hope in the face of grim prospects. Three tracks from the album – "Waiting for the Miracle", "The Future" and "Anthem" – were featured in the movie "Natural Born Killers", which also promoted Cohen's work to a new generation of US listeners. 
As with "I'm Your Man", the lyrics on the "The Future" were dark, and made references to political and social unrest. The title track is reportedly a response to the L.A. unrest of 1992. Cohen promoted the album with two music videos, for "Closing Time" and "The Future", and supported the release with the major tour through Europe, United States and Canada, with the same band as in his 1988 tour, including a second appearance at the PBS's Austin City Limits. Some of the Scandinavian shows were broadcast live on the radio. The selection of performances, mostly recorded on the Canadian leg of the tour, was released on 1994 "Cohen Live" album, but none of the new songs from the album itself were included in the live album.
In 1993 Cohen also published his book of selected poems and songs, "Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs", on which he had worked since 1989. It includes a number of new poems from the late 1980s and early 1990s and major revision of his 1978 book "Death of a Lady's Man".
In 1997, Cohen oversaw the selection and release of "More Best of Leonard Cohen" album, which included a previously unreleased track, "Never Any Good", and an experimental piece "The Great Event". The first was left over from Cohen's unfinished mid-1990s album, which was announced to include songs like "In My Secret Life" (already recited as song-in-progress in 1988) and "A Thousand Kisses Deep", both later re-worked with Sharon Robinson for 2001 album "Ten New Songs".
In 1994, Cohen retreated to the Mt. Baldy Zen Center near Los Angeles, beginning what became five years of seclusion at the center. In 1996, Cohen was ordained as a Rinzai Zen Buddhist monk and took the Dharma name "Jikan", meaning "silence". He served as personal assistant to Kyozan Joshu Sasaki Roshi.
Although around 2000 there was a public impression that Cohen would not resume recording or publishing, he returned to Los Angeles in May 1999. He began to contribute regularly to The Leonard Cohen Files fan website, emailing new poems and drawings from "Book of Longing" and early versions of new songs, like "A Thousand Kisses Deep" in September 1998 and Anjani Thomas's story sent on 6 May 1999, the day they were recording "Villanelle for our Time" (released on 2004 "Dear Heather" album). The section of The Leonard Cohen Files with Cohen's online writings has been titled "The Blackening Pages".
2000s.
Post-monastery records.
After two years of production, Cohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of "Ten New Songs", featuring a heavy influence from producer and co-composer Sharon Robinson. The album, recorded at Cohen's and Robinson's home studios, includes the song "Alexandra Leaving", a transformation of the poem "The God Abandons Antony", by the Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy. The album was a major hit for Cohen in Canada and Europe, and he supported it with the hit single "In My Secret Life" and accompanying video shot by Floria Sigismondi.
In October 2004, Cohen released "Dear Heather", largely a musical collaboration with jazz chanteuse (and current romantic partner) Anjani Thomas, although Sharon Robinson returned to collaborate on three tracks (including a duet). As light as the previous album was dark, "Dear Heather" reflects Cohen's own change of mood – he has said in a number of interviews that his depression has lifted in recent years, which he attributed to Zen Buddhism. In an interview following his induction into the Canadian Songwriters' Hall of Fame, Cohen explained that the album was intended to be a kind of notebook or scrapbook of themes, and that a more formal record had been planned for release shortly afterwards, but that this was put on ice by his legal battles with his ex-manager. He decided not to promote the album at all, but in 2005 he released a home video accompanying the song "Because Of", shot by his daughter Lorca Cohen, while there were no official album singles.
"Blue Alert", an album of songs co-written by Anjani and Cohen, was released on 23 May 2006 to positive reviews. Sung by Anjani, who according to one reviewer "...sounds like Cohen reincarnated as woman...though Cohen doesn't sing a note on the album, his voice permeates it like smoke." The album includes a recent musical setting of Cohen's "As the mist leaves no scar", a poem originally published in "The Spice-Box of Earth" in 1961 and adapted by Phil Spector as "True Love Leaves No Traces" on "Death of a Ladies' Man" album. "Blue Alert" also included Anjani's own version of "Nightingale", performed by her and Cohen on his "Dear Heather", as well the country song "Never Got to Love You", apparently made after an early demo version of Cohen's own 1992 song "Closing Time". During the 2010 tour, Cohen was closing his live shows with the performance of "Closing Time" which included the recitation of verses from "Never Got to Love You". The title song, "Blue Alert", and "Half the Perfect World" were covered by Madeleine Peyroux on her 2006 album "Half the Perfect World", while the third covered song, "Crazy To Love You", was included in the album's Japanese edition.
Before embarking on his 2008–2010 world tour, and without finishing the new album which has been in work since 2006 (new song, "The Street", was recited by Cohen in 2006 on KCRW radio, and he also played two new songs from a demo tape, "Book of Longing" and "Puppets"), Cohen contributed few tracks to other artists' albums – new version of his own "Tower of Song" was performed by him, Anjani Thomas and U2 in 2006 tribute film "Leonard Cohen I'm Your Man" (the video and track were included on the film's soundtrack and released as B-side of U2's single "Window in the Skies", reaching No 1 in Canadian Singles Chart), in 2007 he recited "The Sound of Silence" on album "Tribute to Paul Simon: Take Me to the Mardi Gras" and "The Jungle Line" by Joni Mitchell, accompanied by Herbie Hancock on piano, on Hancock's Grammy-winning album "", while in 2008 he recited the poem "Since You've Asked" on album "Born to the Breed: A Tribute to Judy Collins". According to the press release for his 2012 album "Old Ideas", song "Amen" was recorded in 2007.
Lawsuits and financial troubles.
Sylvie Simmons explains, in her 2012 biography on Cohen that Kelley Lynch, Cohen's longtime manager, "took care of Leonard's business affairs … was not simply his manager but a close friend, almost part of the family." However, Simmons notes that in late 2004, Cohen's daughter Lorca began to suspect Lynch of financial impropriety, and when Cohen checked his bank accounts, he noticed that he had unknowingly paid a credit card bill of Lynch's for $75,000 and also found that most of the money in his accounts was gone (including money from his retirement accounts and charitable trust funds). Cohen would discover that this theft had actually begun as early as 1996 when Lynch started selling Cohen's music publishing rights despite the fact that Cohen had no financial incentive to do so at the time.
On 8 October 2005, Cohen sued Kelley Lynch, alleging that she had misappropriated over US $5 million from Cohen's retirement fund leaving only $150,000. Cohen was sued in turn by other former business associates. These events placed him in the public spotlight, including a cover feature on him with the headline "Devastated!" in Canada's "Maclean's" magazine. In March 2006, Cohen won a civil suit and was awarded US $9 million by a Los Angeles County superior court. Lynch, however, ignored the suit and did not respond to a subpoena issued for her financial records. As a result it has been widely reported that Cohen may never be able to collect the awarded amount.
In 2007, US. District Judge Lewis T. Babcock dismissed a claim by Cohen for more than US $4.5 million against Colorado investment firm Agile Group, and in 2008 he dismissed a defamation suit that Agile Group filed against Cohen. Cohen has been under new management since April 2005.
On 1 March 2012, Sylvie Simmons notes that Kelley Lynch was arrested in Los Angeles for "violating a permanent protective order that forbade her from contacting Leonard, which she had ignored repeatedly. On April 13, the jury found her guilty on all charges. On April 18 she was sentenced to eighteen months in prison and five years probation." Cohen told that court, "It gives me no pleasure to see my onetime friend shackled to a chair in a court of law, her considerable gifts bent to the services of darkness, deceit, and revenge. It is my prayer that Ms. Lynch will take refuge in the wisdom of her religion, that a spirit of understanding will convert her heart from hatred to remorse."
"Book of Longing".
Cohen's book of poetry and drawings, "Book of Longing", was published in May 2006; in March a Toronto-based retailer offered signed copies to the first 1500 orders placed online. All 1500 sold within hours. The book quickly topped bestseller lists in Canada. On 13 May 2006, Cohen made his first public appearance in thirteen years, at an in-store event at a bookstore in Toronto. Approximately 3000 people turned up for the event, causing the streets surrounding the bookstore to be closed. He sang two of his earliest and best-known songs: "So Long, Marianne" and "Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye", accompanied by the Barenaked Ladies and Ron Sexsmith. Also appearing with him was Anjani, the two promoting her new CD along with his book.
In 2006, Philip Glass composed music to Cohen's 2006 book of poetry "Book of Longing". Following the series of live performances which included Glass on keyboards, Cohen's recorded spoken text, four voices (soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, and bass-baritone), and other instruments, and as well the screenings of Cohen's artworks and drawings, Glass' label Orange Mountain Music released a double CD with the recording of the work, entitled "Book of Longing. A Song Cycle based on the Poetry and Artwork of Leonard Cohen".
2008–2010 World Tour.
2008 tour.
13 January 2008, Cohen quietly announced a long-anticipated concert tour. The tour, Cohen's first in 15 years, began 11 May in Fredericton, New Brunswick to wide critical acclaim, and was extended until Winter of 2010. The schedule of the first leg in Summer of 2008 encompassed Canada and Europe, including performances at The Big Chill, the Montreal Jazz Festival, and on the Pyramid Stage at the 2008 Glastonbury Festival on 29 June 2008. His performance at Glastonbury was hailed by many as the highlight of the festival, and his performance of "Hallelujah" as the sun went down received a rapturous reception and a lengthy ovation from a packed Pyramid Stage field. He also played two shows in London's O2 Arena, while in Dublin he was the first performer to play an open air concert at IMMA (Royal Hospital Kilmainham) ground, performing there on 13, 14 and 15 June 2008. In 2009, the performances were awarded Ireland's Meteor Music Award as the best international performance of the year.
In September, October and November 2008, Cohen gave a marathon tour of Europe, including stops in Austria, Ireland, Poland, Romania, Italy, Germany, and Scandinavia. In London, he played two more shows at the O2 Arena and two additional shows at the Royal Albert Hall.
"Live in London".
On 21 March 2009, Cohen released "Live in London", recorded on 17 July 2008 at London's O2 Arena and released on DVD and as a two-CD set. The album contains 25 songs and is over two-and-a-half hours long. It was the first official DVD in Cohen's recording career. The quotation on the album referred to one hundred five-star reviews the tour gained in the international press in 2008.
2009 tour.
The third leg of Cohen's World Tour 2008–2009 encompassed New Zealand and Australia from 20 January to 10 February 2009. In January 2009, The Pacific Tour first came to New Zealand. Simon Sweetman in The Dominion Post (Wellington) of 21 January wrote "It is hard work having to put this concert in to words so I'll just say something I have never said in a review before and will never say again: this was the best show I have ever seen." The Sydney Entertainment Centre show on 28 January sold out rapidly, which motivated promoters to announce a second show at the venue. The first performance was well-received, and the audience of 12,000 responded with five standing ovations. In response to hearing about the devastation to the Yarra Valley region of Victoria in Australia, Cohen donated $200,000 to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal in support of those affected by the extensive Black Saturday bushfires that razed the area just weeks after his performance at the Rochford Winery in the "A Day on the Green" concert. Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper reported: "Tour promoter Frontier Touring said $200,000 would be donated on behalf of Cohen, fellow performer Paul Kelly and Frontier to aid victims of the bushfires."
On 19 February 2009, Cohen played his first American concert in fifteen years at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. The show, showcased as the special performance for fans, Leonard Cohen Forum members and press, was the only show in the whole three-year tour which was broadcast on the radio (NPR) and available as the free podcast.
The North American Tour of 2009 opened on 1 April and included the performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Friday, 17 April 2009, in front of one of the largest outdoor theatre crowds in the history of the festival. His performance of "Hallelujah" was widely regarded as one of the highlights of the festival, thus repeating the major success of the 2008 Glastonbury appearance. The performance has been included on 2010 "Songs from the Road" live release. During this leg, Cohen regularly performed new song, "Lullaby".
On 1 July 2009, Cohen started his marathon European tour, his third in two years. The itinerary mostly included sport arenas and open air Summer festivals in Germany, UK, France, Spain, Ireland (the show at O2 in Dublin won him the second Meteor Music Award in a row), but also performances in Serbia in the Belgrade Arena, in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Turkey, and again in Romania. On 3 August, Cohen gave an open air show at the Piazza San Marco in Venice.
On 18 September 2009, on the stage at a concert in Valencia, Spain, Cohen suddenly fainted halfway through performing his song "Bird on the Wire", the fourth in the two-act set list; Cohen was brought down backstage by his band members and then admitted to local hospital, while the concert was suspended. It was reported that Cohen had stomach problems, and possibly food poisoning. Three days later, on 21 September, on his 75th birthday, he performed in Barcelona. The show, last in Europe in 2009 and rumoured to be the last European concert ever, attracted many international fans, who lighted the green candles honouring Cohen's birthday, leading Cohen to give a special speech of thanks for the fans and Leonard Cohen Forum.
The last concert of this leg was held in Tel Aviv, Israel, on 24 September, three days after Cohen's 75th birthday, at Ramat Gan Stadium. The event was surrounded by public discussion due to a cultural boycott of Israel proposed by a number of musicians. Nevertheless, tickets for the Tel Aviv concert, Cohen's first performance in Israel since 1980, sold out in less than 24 hours. It was announced that the proceeds from the sale of the 47,000 tickets would go into a charitable fund in partnership with Amnesty International and would be used by Israeli and Palestinian peace groups for projects providing health services to children and bringing together Israeli veterans and former Palestinian fighters and the families of those killed in the conflict. However, on 17 August 2009, Amnesty International released a statement saying they were withdrawing from any involvement with the concert and its proceeds. Amnesty International later stated that its withdrawal was not due to the boycott but "the lack of support from Israeli and Palestinian NGOs." The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) led the call for the boycott, claiming that Cohen was "intent on whitewashing Israel's colonial apartheid regime by performing in Israel." On 24 September at the Ramat Gan concert, Cohen was highly emotional about the Israeli-Palestinian NGO Bereaved Families for Peace. He mentioned the organization twice, saying "It was a while ago that I first heard of the work of the 'Bereaved Parents for Peace'. That there was this coalition of Palestinian and Israeli families who had lost so much in the conflict and whose depth of suffering had compelled them to reach across the border into the houses of the enemy. Into the houses of those, to locate them who had suffered as much as they had, and then to stand with them in aching confraternity, a witness to an understanding that is beyond peace and that is beyond confrontation. So, this is not about forgiving and forgetting, this is not about laying down one's arms in a time of war, this is not even about peace, although, God willing, it could be a beginning. This is about a response to human grief. A radical, unique and holy, holy, holy response to human suffering. Baruch Hashem, thank God, I bow my head in respect to the nobility of this enterprise." At the end of the show he blessed the crowd by the Priestly Blessing, a Jewish blessing offered by Kohanim. Cohen's surname derives from this Hebrew word for priest, thus identifying him as a Kohen.
The sixth leg of the 2008–2009 world tour went again to US, with fifteen shows in October and November, with the "final" show in San Jose. The final leg included two new songs, "Feels So Good" and "The Darkness". But at that point, Cohen's "World Tour 2010" was already announced with the European dates in March.
The 2009 world tour earned a reported $9.5 million, putting Cohen at number 39 on "Billboard" magazine's list of the year's top musical "money makers".
Live releases.
On 14 September 2010, Sony Music released a live CD/DVD album, "Songs from the Road", showcasing Cohen's 2008 and 2009 live performances. The previous year, Cohen's performance at the 1970 Isle of Wight Music Festival was released as a CD/DVD combo. The DVD version included interviews with Kris Kristofferson and others.
2010 tour.
Cohen's 2008–2009 world tour was prolonged into 2010. Originally scheduled to start in March, the first dozen of the original European dates were postponed to September and October due to Cohen's lower-back injury. Officially billed as the "World Tour 2010", the tour started on 25 July 2010 in Arena Zagreb, Croatia, where in the week of the show 16 of Cohen's albums simultaneously entered the Croatian Top 40, while Cohen's work was presented by the translation of "Book of Mercy", two of Cohen's biographies, and with selection of poems in major literary magazine "Quorum", while there was also the translation of Linda Hutcheon's work on Cohen's literary output. In December 2010, the national daily newspaper "Vjesnik" ranked Cohen's show among the five most important cultural event in Croatia in 2010, in the poll among dozen of intellectuals and writers; it was the only event ranked which was not actually Croatian. The tour continued through August, with stops in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Scandinavia, and Ireland, where on 31 July 2010 Cohen performed at Lissadell House in County Sligo. It was Cohen’s eighth Irish concert in just two years after a hiatus of more than 20 years. On 12 August, Cohen played the 200th show of the tour in Scandinavium, Gothenburg, Sweden, where he had already played in October 2008; the show was four hours long.
The Fall leg of the European tour started in early September with an open-air show in Florence, Italy, and continued through Germany, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and Austria, where Cohen performed at the famous open-air opera stage of Römersteinbruch bei St. Margarethen im Burgenland, and then continued with dates in France, Poland, Russia (Moscow's State Kremlin Palace), Slovenia and Slovakia. In Slovenia's brand new Arena Stožice, Cohen accepted Croatia's Porin music award for best foreign live video programme, which he won for his "Live in London" DVD. Cohen's last European show was held in Sibamac Arena, in Bratislava, Slovakia. The shows in late September and October were performed without Sharon Robinson, who left this tour leg due to heavy illness; the setlist omitted songs co-written by her, but old Cohen standards were added instead.
The third leg of the 2010 tour started on 28 October in New Zealand and continued in Australia, including an open-air concert at Hanging Rock near Melbourne. It was the first show ever organised at the site. The tour finished with seven special dates added in Vancouver, Portland, Victoria and Oakland, with two final shows in Las Vegas' The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on 10 and 11 December. The very last concert on 11 December was the 246th show on the world tour which started on 11 May 2008.
The world tour 2010 was covered daily on the Flickr photo blog which was edited by Cohen's road manager, entitled Notes from the Road.
2010s.
In 2011, Cohen's poetical output was represented in Everyman's Library Pocket Poets, in a selection "Poems and Songs" edited by Robert Faggen. The collection included a selection from all Cohen's books, based on his 1993 books of selected works, "Stranger Music", and as well from "Book of Longing", with addition of six new song lyrics. Nevertheless, three of those songs, "A Street", recited in 2006, "Feels So Good", performed live in 2009 and 2010, and "Born in Chains", performed live in 2010, were not released on Cohen's 2012 album "Old Ideas", with him being unhappy with the versions of the songs in the last moment; the song "Lullaby", as presented in the book and performed live in 2009, was completely re-recorded for the album, presenting new lyrics on the same melody. Cohen has announced that those songs will be included on the follow-up to "Old Ideas", unofficially announcing very close release date, what was not confirmed as he embarked to the new world tour in August 2012.
A new biography, "I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen", written by Sylvie Simmons, was published in October 2012. The book is the second major biography of Cohen (Ira Nadel's 1997 biography "Various Positions" was the first).
"Old Ideas".
Leonard Cohen's 12th studio album, "Old Ideas", was released worldwide on 31 January 2012, and it soon became the highest charting album of Cohen's entire career, reaching #1 positions in Canada, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Croatia, New Zealand, and top ten positions in United States, Australia, France, Portugal, UK, Scotland, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, Germany, and Switzerland, competing for number one position with Lana Del Rey's debut album "Born to Die", released the same day.
The album was produced by Cohen, Ed Sanders, and Patrick Leonard, who was credited for production, co-writing, engineering and programming of four songs off the album. Anjani Thomas and 2008–10 tour band member Dino Soldo produced one song retrospectively, with members of Cohen's 2008–10 tour band playing prominently on number of songs. Still, only one song was performed fully with the tour band, the leading single for the album, "Darkness", already played on 2009 and 2010 shows. Sharon Robinson, Dana Glover and Jennifer Warnes contributed most of the backing female vocals.
The album was announced with free online single and lyric video for "Show Me the Place". The lyrics for the song "Going Home" were published as a poem in "The New Yorker" magazine in January 2012, prior to the record's release. The entire album has been streamed online by NPR on 22 January and on 23 January by "The Guardian".
The album received uniformly positive reviews from publications like "Rolling Stone", the Chicago Tribune, and The Guardian. At a record release party for the album in January 2012, Cohen spoke with "The New York Times" reporter Jon Pareles who states that "mortality was very much on his mind and in his songs this album." Pareles goes to characterize the album as "an autumnal album, musing on memories and final reckonings, but it also has a gleam in its eye. It grapples once again with topics Mr. Cohen has pondered throughout his career: love, desire, faith, betrayal, redemption. Some of the diction is biblical; some is drily sardonic."
2012–2013 World Tour.
On 12 August 2012, Cohen embarked on new European tour in support of "Old Ideas", adding a violinist to his 2008–10 tour band, now nicknamed Unified Heart Touring Band, and following the same three-hours setlist structure as in 2008–12 tour, with addition of number of songs from "Old Ideas". European leg ended on 7 October, after concerts in Belgium, Ireland (Royal Hospital), France (Olympia in Paris), England (Wembley Arena in London), Spain, Portugal, Germany, Italy (Arena in Verona), Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Romania and Turkey.
The second leg of the Old Ideas World Tour took place in the US and Canada in November and December, with 56 shows altogether on both legs.
Cohen returned to North America in the spring of 2013 with concerts in the USA and Canada. A summer tour of Europe happened shortly afterwards.
Cohen then toured Australia and New Zealand in November-December 2013.
Themes.
Recurring themes in Cohen's work include love, sex, religion, depression, and music itself. He has also engaged with certain political themes, though sometimes ambiguously so.
Love and sex.
"Suzanne" mixes a wistful type of love song with a religious meditation, themes that are also mixed in "Joan of Arc". "Famous Blue Raincoat" is from the point of view of a man whose marriage has been broken by his wife's infidelity with his close friend, and is written in the form of a letter to that friend. "Everybody Knows" is about sexual relationships during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s in which "the naked man and woman are just a shining artifact of the past."
Religion.
Cohen is Jewish, and he has drawn from Jewish religious and cultural imagery throughout his career. Examples include "Story of Isaac", and "Who by Fire", the words and melody of which echo the Unetaneh Tokef, an 11th-century liturgical poem recited on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. Broader Jewish themes sound throughout the album "Various Positions". "Hallelujah", which has music as a secondary theme, begins by evoking the biblical King David composing a song that "pleased the Lord" and continues with references to Bathsheba and Samson. The lyrics of "Whither Thou Goest", performed by him and released in his album "Live in London", are adapted from the Bible (Ruth 1:16–17, King James Version). "If It Be Your Will" also has a strong air of religious resignation.
Depression.
Having suffered from depression during much of his life (although less so in recent years), Cohen's early works often included themes of depression, self-harm and suicide. An atmosphere of depression pervades "Please Don't Pass Me By" and "Tonight Will Be Fine". "Seems So Long Ago, Nancy" and "Dress Rehearsal Rag" are songs about suicidal characters (though another interpretation of "Dress Rehearsal Rag" suggests that the reference to cutting with a razor could be self-harm rather than suicide), and the darkly comic songs "One of Us Cannot Be Wrong" and "Stories of the Street" mention suicide. The song "Teachers" mentions girls who use scalpels to harm themselves, and in "The Butcher", Cohen writes, "Well, I found a silver needle, I put it into my arm. It did some good, it did some harm." However, it is also suggested that this is a reference to heroin use and addiction.
Politics.
Themes of political and social justice also recur in Cohen's work, especially in later albums. In "Democracy", he both acknowledges political problems and celebrates the hopes of reformers: "from the wars against disorder/ from the sirens night and day/ from the fires of the homeless/ and the ashes of decay/ Democracy is coming to the USA." He has made the observation in "Tower of Song" that "the rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor/ And there's a mighty judgment coming." In the title track of "The Future" he recasts this prophecy on a pacifist note: "I've seen the nations rise and fall/ .../ But love's the only engine of survival." In "Anthem", he promises that "the killers in high places say their prayers out loud/ [are gonna hear from me."
War is an enduring theme of Cohen's work that—in his earlier songs and early life—he approached ambivalently. Challenged in 1974 over his serious demeanor in concerts and the military salutes he ended them with, Cohen remarked, "I sing serious songs, and I'm serious onstage because I couldn't do it any other way...I don't consider myself a civilian. I consider myself a soldier, and that's the way soldiers salute." In "Field Commander Cohen" he imagines himself as a soldier of sorts, socializing with Fidel Castro in Cuba—where he had actually visited at the height of US-Cuba tensions in 1961, allegedly sporting a Che Guevara-style beard and military fatigues. This song was written immediately following Cohen's front-line stint with the Israeli air force, the "fighting in Egypt" documented in a passage of "Night Comes On". In 1973, Cohen, who had traveled to Jerusalem to sign up on the Israeli side in the Yom Kippur War, had instead been assigned to a USO-style entertainer tour of front-line tank emplacements in the Sinai Desert, coming under fire.
Deeply moved by encounters with Israeli and Arab soldiers, he left the country to write "Lover Lover Lover". This song has been interpreted as a personal renunciation of armed conflict, and ends with the hope his song will serve a listener as "a shield against the enemy". He would later remark, "'Lover, Lover, Lover' was born over there; the whole world has its eyes riveted on this tragic and complex conflict. Then again, I am faithful to certain ideas, inevitably. I hope that those of which I am in favour will gain." Asked which side he supported in the Arab-Israeli conflict, Cohen responded, "I don't want to speak of wars or sides ... Personal process is one thing, it's blood, it's the identification one feels with their roots and their origins. The militarism I practice as a person and a writer is another thing... I don't wish to speak about war."
His recent politics continue a lifelong predilection for the underdog, the "beautiful loser". Whether recording "The Partisan", a French Resistance song by Anna Marly and Emmanuel d'Astier, or singing his own "The Old Revolution", written from the point of view of a defeated royalist, he has throughout his career expressed in his music sympathy and support for the oppressed. Although Cohen's fascination with war is often as a metaphor for more general cultural and personal issues, as in "New Skin for the Old Ceremony", by this measure his most militant album.
Cohen blends pessimism about political/cultural issues with humour and, especially in his later work, with gentle acceptance.
Personal life.
Romantic relationships.
Leonard Cohen lived at Hydra, Greece in 1960 with Marianne C. Stang Jensen Ihlen (born in Norway 1935), and the song "So Long, Marianne" was written to and about her. Their relationship lasted for most of the 1960s.
Cohen had a relationship beginning in the 1970s with the Los Angeles artist Suzanne Elrod, with whom he has two children: a son, Adam, born in 1972, and a daughter, Lorca, born in 1974 and named after poet Federico García Lorca. Adam Cohen began a career as a singer-songwriter in the mid-1990s and fronts a band called Low Millions, while Lorca took the part in her father's tour team during the 2008–2010 world tour as photographer and videographer. She also shot Cohen's video for the song "Because Of" in 2004, while her "Backstage Sketch" was included on Cohen's 2010 DVD "Songs from the Road". She has directed and shot video clips for The Webb Sisters and Kamila Thompson. On 2 February 2011, Lorca gave birth to a daughter, Viva Katherine Wainwright Cohen with biological father Rufus Wainwright. Lorca is raising the child.
Cohen has said that "cowardice" and "fear" prevented him from ever actually marrying Elrod. Elrod took the cover photograph on Cohen's "Live Songs" album and is pictured on the cover of the "Death of a Ladies' Man" album. She is also the "Dark Lady" of Cohen's 1978 book "Death of a Lady's Man". Cohen and Elrod split up in 1979.
"Suzanne", one of his best-known songs, refers to Suzanne Verdal, the former wife of his friend, the Québécois sculptor Armand Vaillancourt, rather than Elrod.
In the 1980s, Cohen was in a relationship with the French photographer Dominique Issermann, who shot his first two music videos for the songs "Dance Me To The End Of Love" and "First We Take Manhattan". Today Issermann is most famous for her photo sessions with Carla Bruni and for her fashion photography for magazines like "Elle"; in 2010 she was the official photographer of Cohen's world tour. Her photographs were used for the covers of his 1993 book "Stranger Music" and his album "More Best of Leonard Cohen" and for the inside booklet of Cohen's 1988 record "I'm Your Man" (which is dedicated to Issermann with words: "All these songs are for you, D. I.").
In the 1990s, Cohen was romantically linked to actress Rebecca De Mornay. De Mornay co-produced Cohen's 1992 album "The Future", which is also supposedly dedicated to her with an inscription which quotes Rebecca's coming to the well from the Book of Genesis chapter 24 and giving drink to Eliezer's camels, after he prayed for the help; Eliezer ("God is my help" in Hebrew) is Cohen's Hebrew name, and Cohen sometimes referred to himself as "Eliezer Cohen" or even "Jikan Eliezer".
Religious beliefs and practices.
Cohen is described as an observant Jew in an article in "The New York Times":Mr. Cohen keeps the Sabbath even while on tour and performed for Israeli troops during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. So how does he square that faith with his continued practice of Zen? "Allen Ginsberg asked me the same question many years ago," he said. "Well, for one thing, in the tradition of Zen that I've practiced, there is no prayerful worship and there is no affirmation of a deity. So theologically there is no challenge to any Jewish belief." 
Cohen has been involved with Buddhism since the 1970s and was ordained a Buddhist monk in 1996; however, he still considers himself Jewish: "I'm not looking for a new religion. I'm quite happy with the old one, with Judaism."
In his concert in Ramat Gan, Israel, on 24 September 2009, Cohen spoke Jewish prayers and blessings to the audience in Hebrew. He opened the show with the first sentence of Ma Tovu. At the middle he used Baruch Hashem, and he ended the concert reciting the blessing of Birkat Cohanim.
Since the late 1970s Cohen has been associated with Buddhist monk and teacher Kyozan Joshu Sasaki roshi (venerable teacher), regularly visiting him at Mount Baldy Zen Center and serving him as personal assistant during Cohen's own reclusion into Mt. Baldy monastery in the 1990s. Sasaki roshi appears as a regular motif or addressee in Cohen's poetry, especially in the "Book of Longing", and also took part in 1997 documentary about Cohen's monastery years, "Leonard Cohen: Spring 1996". Cohen's 2001 album "Ten New Songs" is dedicated to Joshu Sasaki.
Cultural references.
Cohen is mentioned in the Nirvana song "Pennyroyal Tea" from the band's 1993 release, "In Utero". Kurt Cobain wrote, "Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld/ So I can sigh eternally." Cohen, after Cobain's suicide, was quoted as saying "I'm sorry I couldn't have spoken to the young man. I see a lot of people at the Zen Centre, who have gone through drugs and found a way out that is not just Sunday school. There are always alternatives, and I might have been able to lay something on him."
Cohen is also referenced in the songs "Who Is in Your Heart Now?" by Studio Killers, "A Drop in Time" by Mercury Rev, "Now I Am Here" by The Black, "Ego Is Not A Dirty Word" by Skyhooks, "Under You" by Better Than Ezra, "Fools Gold" by Fiction Family, "Illusions in G Major" by Electric Light Orchestra, and "Careful What You Wish For" by Raine Maida.
In 1991, playwright Bryden MacDonald launched "Sincerely, A Friend", a musical revue based on Cohen's music.

Enobosarm

Enobosarm ((2"S")-3-(4-cyanophenoxy)-"N"-(also known as Ostarine, GTx-024 and MK-2866) is an investigational selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) from GTX, Inc for treatment of conditions such as muscle wasting and osteoporosis, formerly under development by Merck & Company.
Structure.
According to a recent paper authored by GTx, "Readers are cautioned to note that the name Ostarine is often mistakenly linked to the chemical structure of [S-4], which is also known as andarine. The chemical structure of Ostarine has not been publicly disclosed." While GTx has not formally disclosed the structure of Ostarine, the chemical composition of Ostarine is revealed in patent databases such the WIPO and discussed by Zhang et al., 2009 in the primary literature. Various SARM chemotypes exist (aryl propionamides, quinolines, quinolinones, bicyclic hydantoins), though aryl propionamides such as Ostarine, Andarine/S-4, and S-23 represent some of the most advanced putative therapeutics under investigation. In terms of atom connectivity, Enobosarm differs from Andarine by cyano substitutions on the phenyl rings as it replaces both the nitro and acetamido moieties.
Doping.
Selective androgen receptor modulators may be used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to anabolic steroids. For this reason, SARMs were banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency in January 2008 despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs have been developed. 
In June 2013, professional cyclist Nikita Novikov was provisionally suspended after a possible breach of anti-doping rules, due to a positive A-sample result for Ostarine.

Robert de Castel

Robert de Castel (d'Arras) (fl. 1272) was a trouvère active in and around Arras in the late thirteenth century. He is mentioned in the "Congés" of Baude Fastoul, written in 1272, which place him Arras at that date. He is the addressee of the poem "Robert du Chastel, biaus sire", a "jeu parti" by another trouvère of Arras, Jehan Bretel (died 1272), which was judged by another Artesian, Gaidifer d'Avion. 
Robert wrote six songs that have been preserved; two of these achieved some popularity. "En loial amour ai mis" is designated "coronée" (crowned) in one source, indicating that it won a poetic contest, probably to be associated with the Puy d'Arras. More popular was "Se j'ai chanté sans guerredon avoir", which survives in eleven manuscripts: it is recorded in the Phrygian mode in the Chansonnier Cangé, is in the Dorian mode in the Chansonnier du Roi, and is "coronée" in the Chansonnier des Memses. The later anonymous religious piece "La volontés dont mes cuers est ravis" was a contrafactum of its melody. Besides these two songs Robert wrote "Amours me mont me guerroie", "Bien ait l'amours qui m'a doné l'usage", "Nus fins amans ne se doit esmaier", and "Pour (çou) ce se j'ain et je ne sui amés". This last was quoted—both lyrically and to a lesser degree musically—by Guillaume de Machaut in his four-part Middle French motet.

Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo

Fernando Zóbel de Zangróniz Arrieta - Róxas de Ayala y Montojo de Torróntegui (August 27, 1924 – June 2, 1984), also known as Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo and Fernando M. Zóbel, was a Spanish Filipino painter and businessman.
Early life.
Zóbel was born in Ermita, Manila in the Philippines to Enrique Zóbel de Ayala (1877–1943) and Fermina Montojo y Torrontegui and was a member of the prominent Zóbel de Ayala family. He was a brother of Jacobo Zóbel (father of Enrique J. Zóbel), Alfonso (father of Jaime Zóbel de Ayala) and Mercedes Zóbel McMicking, all children of his father from his first wife, Consuelo Róxas de Ayala (who died in September 25, 1907 at the age of 30).
Zóbel took up medical studies at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. In 1942, he had spinal deficiency that forced him to become bedridden that year. To pass the time, he took up sketching. He finished studying in Santo Tomas and left for Harvard University in 1946 to take up degrees in history and literature.
Boston-style works.
Zóbel started painting without formal training while in Harvard. He graduated in 1949 as magna cum laude. He later stayed on as biographical researcher after finishing his bachelor's degree. It was at this time, he met American artists Hyman Bloom, Reed Champion and Jim Pfeufer who helped him launch his career as an artist. His paintings were in style of the Boston artists and are considered his Boston-style works.
Modernism and abstract expressionism.
Zóbel returned to the Philippines and became friends with contemporary Filipino modernist artists. As such, he collected modernist works and set up exhibits for them to be shown and noticed since modernist art was largely unappreciated. In 1954, he left Manila and enrolled in the Rhode Island School of Design where he saw an exhibition by Mark Rothko. Rothko's paintings made an impression on Zobel later to be done in his later works. When he returned to Manila, Zobel started in having interest in Chinese and Japanese art and took up calligraphy classes until 1960. During this time, he joined the faculty of the Ateneo de Manila University and later was given an honorary doctorate and was made honorary director of the Ateneo Art Gallery for his contribution in education and as patron of the arts. To make a name for himself as a full-time painter, he later resigned from his position in the Ayala Corporation and moved to Spain.
"Saeta" and "Serie Negra" series.
Zóbel is best known for his first artwork series called the "Saetas". Named after the liturgical song sung in Holy Week in Spain, they were developed for the most part in the Philippines. Zóbel faced the technical problem of how to achieve the lines that his theme required, lines that were, in his own words, "long, fine, and controlled." The surgical syringe was the solution which was his trademark in painting. The Saetas were his first artworks incorporating colors he saw in Rothko's works. After the Saetas, Zóbel started painting his concept on black as a color in a series called "Serie Negra" or Series in Black influenced by East Asian calligraphy. The Serie Negra was started in 1958 while he was in Madrid which were done after four years.
Later life and death.
After his first two definitive art series, Zóbel began painting landscapes inspired by the river Júcar. In his later years, he created the Museo de Arte Abstracto Español at Casa Colgadas in the town of Cuenca, Spain in 1963. 
Zóbel was a tutor and helped in the careers of Spanish painters some of which were Antonio Lorenzo, Eusebio Sempere, Martín Chirino López, Antonio Saura and many others. Until his death, Zóbel was working on a series called "Dialogos" which was reactions to art masters which he saw in the museums around Europe. In 1983, King Juan Carlos of Spain bestowed upon Zóbel the Medalla de Oro al Mérito en las Bellas Artes. 
Zóbel died of a heart attack in Rome, Italy on June 2, 1984. 
In 2003, a retrospective traveling exhibit in honor of Zobel were held in Cuenca and Seville. On May 21, 2006, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit by the Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo for his contributions in the arts. On May 24, 2008, Zobel's work titled "Noche Clara" was sold at Christie's in Hong Kong was sold for PHP 6,000,000, making it the most expensive Philippine artwork.

Bill Clement (rugby union)

William Harries "Bill" Clement OBE MC TD (9 April 1915 – 10 February 2007) was a Welsh international wing who played club rugby for Llanelli and was capped six times for Wales. Clement was described as a staunch tackler with speed and a good turn of pace; and after his appearance for the British Isles was seen as the best defensive wing of the decade. In his later career he would become Secretary of the Welsh Rugby Union.
He served as an infantry officer in the British Army during the Second World War, and was decorated during the Normandy Campaign, and twice wounded.
Rugby playing career.
Clement was selected to the Wales team while playing for Llanelli, the team he would captain during the 1938/39 season. On 22 October 1935 he was part of the Llanelli team that faced the touring New Zealand national team.
In 1937 Clement was selected to represent the Welsh team as part of the 1937 Home Nations Championship under the captaincy of Claude Davey. It was a terrible campaign for Wales and Clement as the team lost all three matches; though Clement showed his team playing skills when he unselfishly set up a try for Wilf Wooller in the opening game against England.
The selectors kept faith with Clement, and he returned for the entirety of the 1938 campaign, this time with Cliff Jones leading the team. Wales beat England in the opening game and just lost to Scotland three weeks later at Murrayfield. In the final game of the tournament Clement scored his first and only international points when he scored a try at St Helens against Ireland. In 1938 Clement was chosen to represent the British Isles in their the 1938 tour of South Africa. This would be his last rugby campaign as a knee injury sustained in 1938 ended his playing career.
International matches played.
Wales
Military career.
With the outbreak of the Second World War, Clement was commissioned into the 4th Battalion of the Welch Regiment. He was injured in action twice, the first time was during the Battle for Caen, during the action for which he was awarded the Military Cross (MC). On 23 July 1944, Clement, now a war substantive captain and temporary major, was part of a raid on enemy positions around Le Bon Repos, near Caen. Clement was in command of one of two companies of the Welch Regiment involved in the operation, but as they advanced down a 900-yard slope toward the objective, he and his men came under heavy fire and Clement was injured in his leg. They suffered high levels of casualties, one of Clement's platoons was all but wiped out, with just four survivors. Casualties with this platoon included one of just two other officers who had started the attack with Clement. He managed to rally his troops and engaged the enemy in close-quarter combat, killing at least 30. When ordered to withdraw, Clement remained until his wounded had been recovered, and only then returned to the rendezvous, where he finally agreed to receive medical treatment. For his actions in this encounter he was awarded the Military Cross on 21 December 1944. In 1945 he was wounded in action in the Netherlands, again while in charge of his company of the 4th Battalion.
Clement remained in the Territorial Army after the war, holding the rank of captain and honorary major. He was awarded the Territorial Efficiency Decoration for his long service on 29 April 1955, and finally left the army when he reached the age limit for service, on 9 April 1965.
Later life.
After the end of the war, Clement returned to Wales, becoming an accountant in Llanishen. He returned to rugby in 1955 when he was chosen from 83 applicants to take over the roll of Secretary of the WRU after Eric Evans became terminally ill. One of his first duties was to solve the problem of a home international against Scotland in 1956, when the pitch at the Cardiff Arms Park was entirely frozen. Clements arranged for a team of men to keep braziers burning on the pitch overnight in an identical solution to the same problem that effected the same pitch in 1893.
He was secretary throughout the Second Golden Age of Welsh rugby and along with treasurer Ken Harris is remembered for overseeing the rebuilding of the old Cardiff Arms Park. On his retirement in 1981 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to rugby.

<doc id="19965553" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19965553" title="The Dave Howard Singers">
The Dave Howard Singers

The Dave Howard Singers is a cult Canadian alternative rock band/project originally formed in Toronto, Canada. The project is based around the talents of singer-songwriter Dave Howard (the only consistent member) and the signature sound of his Ace Tone organ. During the second half of the 1980s, the band were resident in (and drew many members from) Britain, where they were a cult act making several appearances on nationwide television.
Howard's work is noted for its mixture of eccentric humour and sincerity, and its persistent attempts to marry extremely disparate and clashing elements of light popular music (lounge-pop tunes, crooner vocals) and industrial/electronic avant-garde music (rapid electronic rhythms, noise, screaming). Howard’s vigorous stagecraft and highly emotional performance style has led him to be described as a "surreal revolutionary", "a vaudeville entertainer for the post-apocalyptic age" and "damned irresponsible and depraved". His songs have been described as "evoking a singular world both comforting and cruel." Howard himself has admitted “I've always had a passion for exploring extreme emotions, especially in my work. Extremely deranged, delighted, demented, deluded, you name it.”
Early years (1979-1984).
An ex-student of the Royal Conservatory of Ontario, Dave Howard started his musical career in Toronto in 1979, as part of a post-punk band called The Diner’s Club (also featuring drummer Boris Rosych and guitarist Brian Ruryk). Howard noted later “we were into all that stuff out of New York like Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, DNA, The Contortions and of course Suicide. I also liked the clean minimalism of groups like Young Marble Giants. And just to totally confuse you, a tiny portion from my list of early influences would be Burt Bacharach, The Beatles, John Barry, early Genesis, Bernard Hermann, Holst, Debussy and Dean Martin.”
Striking out as a solo act in 1981 (accompanied by a drum machine called “Max”), Howard took on the ironic project name of The Dave Howard Singers - despite the fact that not only was he the only singer in the group, but also the only member. Drawing principally on his Suicide and Burt Bacharach influences, he performed song-sets mingling rapid electronic rhythms and noise with lounge-friendly pop tunes and crooner vocals. Audiences confused by this mixture – apart from those who were implacably hostile - were won over by Howard’s sense of humour and encouragement of audience participation (he would invite them to sing along, heckle and tell stories as part of his concert experience). While Toronto-based, he supported international music acts such as James Chance and the Contortions, The Psychedelic Furs and Jah Wobble. The debut Dave Howard Singers release was the 8-song cassette album "Alone And Gone" in 1983, followed by the cassette EP "A Loan And A Yawn".
The London years (late 1984-1986).
In October 1984, British keyboard player and producer Dave Formula (Magazine, Visage) was brought in by Howard’s manager Peter Noble to produce Howard’s recordings. Formula persuaded Howard and Noble that if Howard was serious about a musical career, he should relocate to Britain. Following Formula's advice, Howard moved to London and was teamed up with ex-Howard Devoto sidemen Pat Aherne (drums) and Martin Heath (bass, formerly of The Poison Girls) to form a live trio. This line-up recorded the "Whoishe?" EP, including the live favourite (and "Mad Max" tribute) “Road Warrior”, which was released on Howard’s own label Hallelujah! Records (via Rough Trade). However, Howard soon became dissatisfied with the musical direction he was being groomed for. Following a WOMAD gig in 1985 at which he had been presented (semi-ironically) as Canada’s musical representative, Howard parted company with Formula, Aherne and Heath.
The day after WOMAD, Howard teamed up with fellow Canadian Nick Smash, a stand-up drummer and “heavy percussionist” who'd previously worked with Rent Boys Inc. The new-look Dave Howard Singers made an appearance on "The Tube", toured with The Shock Headed Peters and supported Sonic Youth in Amsterdam.
The Dave Howard Singers followed up "Whoishe?" with the live-in-concert EP "Goodnight Karl Malden" EP, recorded in winter 1985 in the Netherlands and released in March 1986. To promote the EP, The Dave Howard Singers pulled off a considerable press coup by playing a bizarre free concert (assisted by slide and video projections) at the London Canadian Embassy (Canada House) in April 1986. Howard posed, tongue-in-cheek, as a cultural representative (much as he had at WOMAD in 1985) and delivered a noisy set. Described as "the loudest launch reception for a record ever witnessed", the concert was a great cult success and was covered by (among others) Melody Maker, Sounds and New Musical Express.
In October 1986, The Dave Howard Singers released a cover version of the David Essex hit "Rock On" (produced by The Stranglers’ JJ Burnel). This was described at the time as "frighteningly minimalist" and as "ruffian unrest". Even as recently as 2004, the single was described in retrospect as “mutated… beyond all recognition, with Max providing heavy duty electro beats, Nick Smash beating the shit out of his tom-toms and Dave screaming his lungs out (through) a convoluted series of sections before finally degenerating into full-on insanity, with Dave screeching a tirade of obscenities.” Howard made much of the initial friction between himself and Burnel (the latter a committed DHS fan) during the recording session ("It all got off to a tempestuous start. On the first day I was so uptight and made him uptight, so he threatened me with my life. I was thinking, God, this isn't how it should be working out. Then, after the air was cleared, it all worked out fine.")
Nick Smash left the band the day before the "Rock On" video was to be shot, having clashed with manager Peter Noble and claiming to be "getting pretty sick of that Ace Tone". He would later to patch up his personal relationship with Howard, although he would not return to the band.
The London years (1987-1992).
Still using the “Dave Howard Singers” project name, Howard continued as a solo performer (accompanied by the ever-faithful Max). He released the “quasi-hip-hop” single "Yon Yonson" (based on an American nonsense rhyme) in 1987, immediately following it up with a disco remix called "Yon Yonson Meets Dr R-R-Ruth" (which spliced the original single with "crackpot sex therapy out-takes").
By May 1988, Howard had recruited singers Wendy and Sarah to provide live backing vocals for him. Bernadette Keeffe (of The Happy End) also sang with him for about a year. In November 1988, The Dave Howard Singers supported Spacemen 3. By this point, Howard’s onstage stunts including placing his Ace Tone organ on a wheelchair rather than a keyboard stand (while in Canada, he had often sat in a wheelchair to play the organ). The single "What Do You Say To An Angel?" (inspired by an unprovoked attack on Howard by a Hell's Angel) appeared in early 1989. By this time, the line-up of the Dave Howard Singers had changed again with the addition of “guitar alchemist” Simon Walker, who in turn had brought in T. Daniel Howard (drums). The band became a quartet with the addition of bass player Christian “Bic” Hayes (ex-Ring), whose additional unicycling and juggling skills had endeared him to Howard. 
Bic would eventually leave The Dave Howard Singers to play guitar with Cardiacs, and was later known for his membership of first Levitation and subsequently Dark Star. He was temporarily replaced by Stump bassist Kev Hopper. Later in 1989, Simon Walker also left The Dave Howard Singers when he was recruited by The House Of Love to replace the infamous Terry Bickers (who himself was shortly to join another ex-DHS member, Bic, in Levitation). Regarding the poaching of Walker, Howard was later to comment, with regret, “It was a sad day... You know, it's just me but I don't think they made full use of him. Pity.”
The band reorganised as a trio of Dave Howard, T. Daniel Howard and new bass player Bevin Burke. With a new recording contract signed with the Ghetto Recording Company, this lineup recorded the single “All My Relatives Look The Same” (released in 1990) and the long-awaited Dave Howard Singers debut album "It’s About Time" (1991) which was produced by Paul “Thwack” Laventhol (the former King Kurt guitarist, and Dave Howard’s neighbour). Later on in 1991, Burke was replaced on bass by Anand Gary Subassa (a.k.a. “Subs”) and the band undertook a tour of Europe, frequently playing at squat parties. However, the band's progress was damaged when Ghetto Recording Company folded at the time of the album release (part of the general malaise hitting the British music industry at the time). Consequently, "It’s About Time" was only released in Germany (apart from an unusual release in Canada for which the band operated under the name of Devoured and the album was released under the title "13").
By early 1992, a disaffected Dave Howard had spent eight years on the margins of the British music industry only to have his hopes dashed by bad luck. Taking stock of the situation, he dissolved the band, quit music and moved back to Canada. He has also cited “the fact that certain family members weren't gettin' any younger and didn't have family close by to look out for them” as affecting his decision.
Back in Canada (1992-2006).
Back in Toronto, Howard was soon coaxed out of retirement to play with Paul Laventhol (who’d also moved to Canada) in a burlesque band which also featured drummer Keith “Keef” McGuinness. Laventhol’s time in Canada was fairly short, and once he had returned to the UK Howard and McGuinness became the duo Me And Keith (which played two concerts, a year apart). After the end of this project, Howard retired his Ace Tone organ and retreated to the studio to write music for Canada’s Global Television Network. He subsequently became Audio Director of the multimedia production company Chromacide and went on to write music for cartoons, commercials, websites and animations.
The return of the Dave Howard Singers (2007-present).
On April 7, 2007, the original lineup of The Dave Howard Singers (Howard and Max) reconvened to play at Mitzi’s Sister, Toronto. The project have performed several gigs since then. Apparently reinvigorated by his live activity, Howard has re-released his first four UK EPs ("Whoishe?", "Goodnight Karl Malden", "Rock On", "Yon Yonson") as a compilation CD called "What Your Girlfriend Threw Out, Or Your Friend Never Returned". They continue to perform live, however only when the occasion is justified. On Monday November 12, 2012 at the Wrongbar Toronto, On. The Dave Howard Singers had the distinct honour of opening for the incomparable Lydia Lunch.

Gaidifer (Gadifer) d'Avion (fl. 1230–50) was an Artesian trouvère from Avion. He entered the Church and was associated with the poets of the so-called "School of Arras". 
Gaidifer was well-connected to contemporary poets. He was a respondent to Jehan Bretel in two "jeux partis" judged by the trouvères Perrin d'Angicourt and Jehan le Cuvelier d'Arras and the banker Audefroi Louchart. Gaidifer was a judge of Jehan de Grieviler and Robert de Castel in two other "jeux partis". 
Besides his two "jeux", Gaidifer wrote seven "chanson courtoises", six of which appear only in the Rome Chansonnier. His style is described as "sharply circumscribed": all his poems are isometric and octo- or decasyllabic. All his simple melodies are in bar form, but spanning wide ranges (often an octave or higher). In "Tant ai d'amours", which served as a model for Lambert Ferri ("J'ai tant d'amours apris et entendu") and Adam de la Bassée ("Ave rosa rubens et tenera"), there is repetition in the cauda. One piece, "Tout me samble", does not survive with its music.

Richard Morrison (ambassador)

Sir Richard Morrison (or Morison or Morysine) (ca. 1513-1556) was an English humanist scholar and diplomat. He was a protégé of Thomas Cromwell, propagandist for Henry VIII, and then ambassador to the German court of Charles V for Edward VI. 
Life.
Richard Morrison was the son of Thomas Morison of Hertfordshire by a daughter of Thomas Merry of Hatfield. He had a sister, Amy, who married Stephen Hales (d. 27 March 1574), esquire, of Newland, Warwickshire, brother of John Hales.
Morrison attended Cardinal College, Oxford (now Christ Church) ca. 1526 and met Nicholas Udall, who became the master of Eton College and was known as the father of English comedy. He graduated B.A. at Oxford on 19 January 1527–8, and directly entered the service of Thomas Wolsey; but he soon left the cardinal, visited Hugh Latimer at Cambridge, and went to Italy to study Greek. He attended the University of Padua in 1532, making the acquantaince there of Michael Throckmorton. In Italy both these young humanists had links with a group of reformers later called ‘spirituali’, whom Morison met through contacts with Edmund Harvel and Bishop Cosimo Gheri. He became a proficient if impoverished scholar at Venice and Padua, and retained an interest in literature, along with his adopted Calvinistic religious views. 
Writing in February 1536 to Thomas Cromwell, he said that he wished to do something else than be wretched in Italy. Cromwell summoned him home, and gave him an official appointment. Morison and Throckmorton subsequently took up diametrically opposed religious positions: while Throckmorton would embark on a career as agent for Reginald Pole, Morison returned to England to become Henry VIII's propagandist, producing "A Remedy for Sedition" in response to the Pilgrimage of Grace. Cromwell used a whole coterie of "divers fresh and quick wits" that also included Nicholas Udall, John Bale, John Heywood (C. 1497-1580), Thomas Gibson, William Marshall, John Rastell, Thomas Starkey, Richard Taverner and John Uvedale.
On 17 July 1537 he became prebendary of Yatminster in Salisbury Cathedral, and derived benefit from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. He received the mastership of the hospitals of St. James's, Northallerton, Yorkshire, and St. Wulstan, Worcester, with other monastic grants. The King in 1541 is said to have given him the library of the Carmelites in London. 
In 1546 Morison went as ambassador to the Hanseatic League. On Henry VIII's death he was furnished with credentials to the king of Denmark, and ordered by the council to announce Edward VI's accession. On 8 May 1549 he was made a commissioner to visit the university of Oxford, and before June 1550 was knighted. In 1550 Morison replaced Sir Philip Hoby as Ambassador to the Emperor. Setting off in July, he went with Roger Ascham as his secretary, the two reading Greek every day together. His despatches to the council were long, but Morison found time to travel in Germany with Ascham, who published in 1553 an account of their experiences in "A Report of the Affaires of Germany." The emperor frequently remonstrated through Morison about the treatment of the Princess Mary; and he did not altogether like Morison, who was in the habit reading Bernard Ochino's "Sermons" or Machiavelli to his household ‘for the sake of the language.’ 
After Edward's death, Morison was revoked as ambassador. On 5 August 1553 he and Sir Philip Hoby received a recall for a political gaffe: they had alluded to Guilford Dudley as king in a letter to the council. The next year Morison withdrew to Strasburg with Sir John Cheke and Anthony Cooke, and spent his time in study under Peter Martyr, whose patron he had been at Oxford. He was at Brussels early in 1555, and is said also to have passed into Italy, but he died at Strasburg on 17 March 1556. 
Morison died a rich man, and had begun to build the mansion of Cashiobury in Hertfordshire.
Works.
Morison said: 
He is also said to have written ‘Comfortable Consolation for the Birth of Prince Edward, rather than Sorrow for the Death of Queen Jane,’ after the death of Jane Seymour on 24 October 1537. ‘A Defence of Priests' Marriages’ is sometimes assigned to him (probably appeared between 1549 and 1553). 
In manuscript are ‘Maxims and Sayings,’ Sloane MS. 1523; ‘A Treatise of Faith and Justification,’ Harl. MS. 423 (4); ‘Account of Mary's Persecution under Edward VI,’ Harl. MS. 353. Morison suggested to king Henry VIII that the popular Robin Hood plays should be suppressed in favour of anti-papist propaganda. His attitude is clear in a Cottonian manuscript entitled "A Discourse Touching the Reformation of the Lawes of England" (1535):
Marriage and issue.
Morrison married Bridget Hussey, the daughter of John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford; after his death she remarried twice, in 1561 to Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland and then in 1566 to Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford. By her he had a son Charles, afterwards Sir Charles, kt., and three daughters: Jane married to Edward, Lord Russell, son of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford; Elizabeth to William Norris; and Mary to Bartholomew Hales. His son completed Cashiobury, which passed into the Capel family by the marriage of Sir Charles's daughter Elizabeth with Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham. According to Anthony Wood, Morison left illegitimate children.
By his mistress Lucy Peckham (d. 31 July 1552), the daughter of Thomas Peckham, and wife of Sir George Harper (d. 12 December 1558), Morrison had a son and three daughters. According to the inquisition post mortem taken 18 October 1560, these children were Marcellus Harper (d. 1 February 1559); Frances, who married William Patrickson, gentleman; Mary, who married Bartholomew Hales, gentleman, brother of John Hales; and Anne, who died unmarried.

Tuxedo, Maryland

Tuxedo is an unincorporated community in Prince George's County, Maryland, in the United States.
History.
Scattered settlement in Tuxedo appeared along the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (later the Pennsylvania Railroad) by 1886, according to historic maps. The community is bounded on the north by the Town of Cheverly, on the south and east by the John Hanson Highway, and on the west by the B&O Railroad line. The settlement slowly developed along three blocks adjacent to the rail line. By 1917, the community contained approximately 20 houses, one church, and one school. Tuxedo grew to include two additional blocks and a total of approximately 50 residences and a new school by 1942.
Tuxedo has remained unincorporated, but shares services with the incorporated town of Cheverly, which was developed in the early 20th century. The second school constructed in Tuxedo was called the Cheverly-Tuxedo School and opened in 1923. This school and another facility in Cheverly remained in operation until 1991. Since that time, the Cheverly-Tuxedo School has functioned as a specialty education center. Another facility shared with Cheverly was the volunteer fire department. The Tuxedo-Cheverly Fire Station was constructed in 1930. This building has since been enlarged and is now operated by Prince George’s County. Most of the land in and around Tuxedo has become industrial because of its proximity to the railroad line, the John Hanson Highway, and Baltimore-Washington Parkway.

Jérôme Carrein

Jérôme Carrein (1939 – 23 June 1977, Douai) was the second-to-last convicted criminal to be executed by guillotine in France.
On 27 October 1975 in Arleux, Northern France, Jérôme Carrein, father of five children, often of no fixed abode, an alcoholic and a tuberculosis sufferer, met Cathy Petit, an eight-year-old local girl. Petit was the daughter of the owner of a bar that Carrein frequented. He enticed the girl to follow him into nearby marshlands to search for fish bait. Having arrived there, Carrein attempted to rape the child before strangling and drowning her.
Carrein was arrested the next day and quickly confessed to his crime. He was tried before the Pas-de-Calais criminal court at Saint Omer, found guilty and sentenced to death on 12 July 1976. Christian Ranucci, also sentenced to death for a child murder, was guillotined at Marseille's Baumettes prison sixteen days later.
Carrein appealed against his sentence and was retried on 1 February 1977 at the criminal court in Douai. Two weeks before the second trial began, Patrick Henry, another child murderer, had narrowly escaped a death sentence at the criminal court in Troyes thanks to the skill of his lawyer, Robert Badinter, and public outrage in France was particularly strong. Carrein was found guilty again and sentenced to death a second time.
Carrein's final appeal in mid-June 1977 was turned down by President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. Carrein was guillotined at 04:30 on 23 June 1977 in the yard of Douai prison; the executioner was Marcel Chevalier. Only one more convicted criminal – Hamida Djandoubi – would suffer death upon the guillotine in France.

Rogers Heights, Maryland

Rogers Heights is an unincorporated community in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States.
History.
The Rogers Heights subdivision is bounded on the north by 1950s-era subdivisions, on the south and east by Bladensburg, and on the west by Edmonston. Named after one of the former owners of the land tract, Rogers Heights was developed between 1938 and 1952. Two factors contributed largely to the selection of this tract for development; roadways and sewers. The subdivision was located along or close to major roadways. Rogers Heights is located along Edmonston Avenue, a north-south route later rebuilt as Kenilworth Avenue. This road gave residents access to Bladensburg and the Bladensburg Road into the District of Columbia. Residents could also travel west on Decatur Street to the growing center of Hyattsville and access U.S. Route 1. The second factor in the settlement of Rogers Heights was the availability of public sewer lines from Bladensburg.
By 1942, the Rogers Heights subdivision contained ten residential blocks and approximately 200 residences. The streets were laid out in a grid pattern with three roads extending east from Edmonston Avenue intersected by five north-south streets. Roads constructed between 1942 and 1957 to the east of the earlier blocks were slightly more curvilinear. The common building type constructed was the modest brick and frame ranch. Scattered commercial properties are located along Edmonston and Kenilworth Avenues. However, most of the retail facilities are clustered around the Riverdale Plaza, in nearby Riverdale Park.
The area is served by Rogers Heights elementary school and Bladensburg High School; Elizabeth Seton High School (Catholic, girls-only) and the Bladensburg Community Center Park are also located in Bladensburg, immediately adjacent to Rogers Heights.

Van Duyn v Home Office Ch. 358 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61974J0041:EN:NOT C-41/74) was a case of the 1974 European Court of Justice concerning the free movement of workers between member states.
Facts.
The British government denied Yvonne Van Duyn, a Dutch national, an entry permit because she was affiliated with the Scientology religion, which the government had believed to be socially harmful. She sued, citing the Treaty of Rome and Community law, and the case was referred to the European Court of Justice.
Judgment.
Under Article 48 of the ECC Treaty, the Court ruled that states could exclude a national from another state on public policy grounds based only on the personal conduct of that individual, and in Van Duyn's case her affiliation with a group could be considered personal conduct. Thus, because Britain had in the seventies a public policy of preventing the spread of Scientology (this policy was repealed in 1980 after parliamentary review), the Home secretary's exclusion order of Van Duyn was allowed under community law.

Donald Smith (tenor)

Donald Sydney Smith OBE (27 July 19201 December 1998) was an Australian operatic tenor. His voice had a bright Italianate quality, which could match in size, carrying power and tonal allure the voices of most sopranos and mezzos. He attracted a fiercely loyal public following, and many Australians who had no prior experience of opera became opera lovers through Smith's work. His performances were regularly sold out.
Biography.
Donald Sydney Smith was born in Bundaberg, Queensland, on 27 July 1920. His early schooling and education was spasmodic and at around 10 years old, while in 4th grade primary school, he was removed from school by his parents to help work on his family's milk run and dairy property. At around the age of 12 years old he was sentenced to the Westbrook Farm Home for boys (outside Toowoomba), where he spent some seven months for allegedly stealing and 'joy riding' in a friend's father's motor vehicle. He was subsequently released into the care of one of his older sisters. During this period in his early teenage years he continued to educate himself while working as a sugar cane cutter on properties in and around the Bundaberg area. At the age of 18 years old, he met Thelma Joyce Lovett, whom he married in Bundaberg in 1942 and remained with until his death. After his wedding he worked in the capacity as a sugar chemist for the Bundaberg Fairymead Sugar Mill. In 1942 their son Robin was born, and his two daughters Deanna and Beth were born in 1943 and 1945 respectively.
On 4 October 1941, during World War II, Smith enlisted in the Australian Army. He served at Milne Bay in New Guinea. It was in New Guinea while serving as private and a machine gunner that he was wounded in the right hand by friendly fire after being mistaken for the enemy, while setting up range markers for the guns. He was first transported to an American-based hospital ship for treatment of his injuries. The Australian Army at that time were unaware of where he was being treated. Therefore it was during this time that his wife Joyce (who was on her way to hospital to deliver their first daughter Deanna) was advised by the Army that he was "missing in action, believed to be deceased". He was discharged on 28 October 1943 as a private from the 47th Battalion. During recuperation for his injuries and after being repatriated to Australia, his family were then advised that he was still alive.
Smith began his career singing on the local radio station 4BU Bundaberg, singing mainly country and western songs. His first singing teacher was a lady named Kate Gratehead. It was she who helped him refine his musical ability and vocal technique for his natural tenor voice. After the birth of their third child, Smith and his wife left Bundaberg and relocated firstly to Toowoomba and then to Brisbane. Here Smith became acquainted with the well known band leader J.J. Kelly. Under Kelly's direction, Smith performed the tenor roles in his first operas, including the lead tenor role in Sir Edward German's "Merrie England" in Brisbane in 1944. He also performed the lead tenor role in Michael William Balfe's "The Bohemian Girl" and the role of 'Don Caesar de Bazen' in William Vincent Wallace's "Maritana".
In 1948, he joined the Brisbane Opera Society, and sang roles such as Don José ("Carmen"), the title role in "Faust", the Duke of Mantua ("Rigoletto"), Roméo ("Roméo et Juliette") and Canio ("Pagliacci"). Canio was a role with which he became particularly associated. In 1952 he began two years of study at London's National School of Opera, after winning the 'Mobil Quest' singing competition. He returned to Australia, and sang with an Italian touring company in 1955, alongside singers such as Gabriella Tucci and Ken Neate. In 1958 he appeared with the then Elizabeth Trust Opera Company, singing Count Almaviva ("The Barber of Seville") and Tamino ("The Magic Flute"). In 1960 he sang Pinkerton opposite Dame Joan Hammond's Madama Butterfly.
He made his Sadler's Wells debut in England in 1962, where he performed many Verdi operas such as "Attila". He also sang at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, where he made his debut as Calaf in "Turandot" opposite the English soprano Amy Shuard. He made his career in the UK for six years, returning in 1967 to sing with the Australian Opera in roles such as Canio, Manrico ("Il trovatore"), Bob Boles ("Peter Grimes"), the Duke of Mantua, Dick Johnson ("The Girl of the Golden West"), Cavaradossi ("Tosca"), Radames ("Aida"), and the King ("A Masked Ball"). He also appeared in German roles, such as Florestan in "Fidelio".
In 1968, the first opera telecast in Australia, "Tosca", featured Marie Collier in the title role, Donald Smith as Cavaradossi, and Tito Gobbi as Scarpia.
On 21 January 1973 Donald was the first voice to sing in the Sydney Opera House, when he appeared in the first test concert in the Opera Theatre, along with Elizabeth Fretwell and members of the ABC National Training Orchestra, conducted by Robert Miller.
While Italian opera (and particularly where sung in English) was his natural metier, he also performed many concerts and song recitals. Together with his son Robin Donald Smith, who performed professionally under the name Robin Donald, they presented in 1974 a series of "Smith & Son" concerts throughout Australia.
Donald Smith's last performance for the Australian Opera was in Verdi's "I masnadieri" with Joan Sutherland. This was the only occasion that these two singers sang a complete opera together. He became ill and retired in 1981. He later became a singing teacher in Brisbane at the Queensland Conservatorium of Music.
He made many individual recordings both in England with the Sadler's Wells Opera Company and in Australia with EMI records. He also appears in compilation videos and CDs such as "Celebration – 40 Years of Opera", and "Australian Singers of Renown in Opera, Operetta & Song", compiled by John Cargher.
Donald Smith died in a Brisbane nursing home, with members of his extended family by his side, on 1 December 1998. He was survived by his wife Thelma Joyce (who died on 26 November 2009) and their three children.
His eldest grandson is former English Premier League player Jason Cundy, eldest son of his youngest daughter Carol-Beth Cundy.
Honours.
In 1973 Donald Smith was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He was the first resident member of the Australian Opera to be awarded this honour.

<doc id="19965903" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19965903" title="Extra credit">
Extra credit

Extra credit is an academic concept, particularly used in American schools. Students are offered the opportunity to undertake optional work, additional to their compulsory school work, in order to gain additional credit that would boost their grades.
Reasons for extra credit.
Teachers employ extra credit for a variety of reasons. For example, it may be felt that students who are highly capable may benefit from additional challenge that might not be suitable as required work for all students. Extra credit may also be used as a way to allow a student to improve his or her grade after weak performance earlier in a course. In both of these cases, extra credit can promote differentiated instruction by factoring in optional work in the assessment of student performance.
Method of computation.
Typically, participation in extra credit can only improve one's grade. Points might be added to an existing activity, for example, if the student correctly answers a more difficult portion of a test than would be required to meet the objectives of a unit. Optional activities may also add points or marks used in an overall grade computation. This may, for example, increase the numerator of the fraction used in computing an overall percentage, while leaving the denominator unchanged. This can lead to grade percentages that exceed 100% unless the policy used for grade computations caps a grade at a maximum value.
Controversial aspects.
Author Julia G. Thompson refers to extra credit as "a controversial topic for teachers." In California, during late 2006, there was controversy when students were offered extra credits simply for buying course books in an effort to overcome a lack of resources. In 2002, in Pennsylvania, a student took part in an anti-abortion demonstration in order to gain additional credits.
In popular culture.
The concept has been featured in a titular role in various works of fiction, including "Amber Brown Wants Extra Credit" and the Degrassi "extra credit" series.

Destructive fishing practices

The phrase destructive fishing practices (or DFPs) has been featured in international fisheries literature for around three decades. No widely accepted definition of the phrase exists, and this will almost certainly remain the situation, given very different national and industry perspectives. The DFPs discussion with the most standing is that of the Fisheries and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations - the FAO.
The Outcomes and Implementation Statements of the "World Summit on Sustainable Development", held in Johannesburg in 2002, contain a commitment to phasing out destructive fishing practices in the marine environment by the year 2012. All nations attending the summit supported this statement.
Many nations had made commitments to end destructive fishing practices much earlier. In 1999, 124 nations explicitly gave their support to the FAO "Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries 1995" through the Rome Declaration on Responsible Fisheries. The list of these nations includes most of the major fishing nations of the world. However, while the Code of Conduct contains a commitment to end destructive fishing practices, the Code contains no time-lines.
The narrowest definition of destructive fishing practices refers principally to bottom trawling over vulnerable habitat (shallow corals, deep sea corals, or seagrass, for example), as well as practices such as shark-finning, blast-fishing, poison-fishing, muroami, and push-netting. These latter practices are not significant within the fishing zones of most developed nations, being generally outlawed. Bottom trawling over vulnerable habitat, however, will continue within the Exclusive Fishing Zones of most nations until governments have mapped the location of vulnerable habitats, and taken steps to exclude all bottom trawling activities from these areas.
A wider and more useful definition would include:
This definition could be extended to cover activities such as:

Scott Owens

Scott Owens (born 1963) is American poet.
History.
Owens was born in Greenwood, South Carolina, and raised in mill villages and on his grandparents' small farm. His father was in the military, and the family later moved to Fort Bragg, NC, and then to Darmstadt, Germany, and Augusta, Georgia, where he graduated from the Academy of Richmond County. Most of his early childhood was lived below the poverty line, necessitating frequent relocation in and around Greenwood. His childhood was also marked by periods of domestic abuse by his stepfathers. His mother was married 6 times during his childhood and his father 5 times. Three of their marriages were to each other.
Owens was the first member of his family to attend college. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English with a minor in Education at Ohio University, continuing on to the University of North Carolina, Charlotte for a Masters Degree in English. He also earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing from the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, and taught at the middle school, high school, and college levels, including a stint as Headmaster of The Patterson School. He is the founder of the reading series, Poetry Hickory (2007 - ), author of the poetry column, "Musings," published in "Outlook", editor of "Wild Goose Poetry Review", founding editor of "234", former Associate Editor of "Southern Poetry Review," Vice President of the Poetry Council of NC and the NC Poetry Society, Founder of The Art of Poetry at the Hickory Museum of Art, and a writer of reviews of poetry collections. He has taught creativity, writing, and poetry workshops at various schools, conferences, and conventions throughout the Southeast. Owens is recognized as a proponent of and community organizer for poetry.
Owens has completed most of his creative and critical work while living in Hickory, North Carolina, and teaching at Catawba Valley Community College. His poems have been nominated for nine Pushcart Prizes and seven Best of the Net Awards, and received awards from the Academy of American Poets, the North Carolina Poetry Society, the Poetry Society of South Carolina, the Next Generation Indie Awards, and the North Carolina Writer's Network. His poem, "So Norman Died of Course,"received a Special Mention from the Pushcart Prize Anthology for 2009 and "On the Days I Am Not My Father" and "Rails" were featured on Garrison Keillor's "The Writer's Almanac" in 2008 and "Cleaning House" in 2014. His more than 1100 published poems have appeared in a diverse range of journals, including "Georgia Review", "North American Review", "Poetry East", "Hayden’s Ferry Review", "Cimarron Review", "Greensboro Review", "Chattahoochee Review", "Cream City Review", "Beloit Poetry Journal", and "Cottonwood", among others. More than 100 of his essays and reviews have appeared in "Main Street Rag," "The Pilot," "Pirene's Fountain," and many others.
Themes.
Owens' poems treat a wide range of themes often expressed as dialectics, including faith and agnosticism, abuse and parenting, alienation and existentialism, loneliness and collaboration, entrapment and liberation, personal relationships and self-sufficiency, the disappearance of a rural American South characterized as both pastoral and violent, and the possibilities of redemption as his characters attempt to make sense of an often seemingly senseless world. His settings and imagery are familiar but often quirky, utilizing extended metaphors and juxtaposing the mundane with the transcendent in sometimes disturbing ways. His work is marked by diversity in tone, style and subject matter, at times nearly formal, at other times conversational and performance-based; at times political, at other times focused on nature; at times distraught about the state of humanity, but just as often optimistic and celebratory. He often re-envisions the lives of familiar historical and mythological characters and has created his own everyman figure named Norman. He cites deep imagism, confessionalism, and surrealism among his strongest influences. and lists Whitman, Frost, Stevens, Williams, Cummings, Plath, Sexton, Yannis Ritsos, Yehuda Amichai, CP Cavafy, George Seferis, Adrienne Rich, Galway Kinnell, and Tim Peeler as the poets who have had the greatest impact on his own work and thought.

__NOTOC__
The THK-16 "Mehmetçik" (Turkish: "Little Mehmet")was an aircraft designed in Turkey in the early 1950s to provide the Turkish Air Force with a domestically designed and built jet trainer. The project was cancelled without the aircraft having been built.
As designed, the THK-16 was to have been a conventional, mid-wing monoplane with the pilot and instructor seated in tandem under a long canopy. Power would have been provided by two small turbojets mounted in underwing nacelles, and construction was to have been metal throughout. Design work was practically complete in 1952 when Türk Hava Kurumu was bought out by MKEK. Although the THK-16 was selected as one of the THK designs that MKEK felt was worth continuing with and allocated the designation MKEK-3, the Turkish Air Force purchased the Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star as its jet trainer and work on the local design was abandoned.

Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement

The Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement was created by the United Nations to enhance the cooperative management of fisheries resources that span wide areas, and are of economic and environmental concern to a number of nations. As of 2013, the treaty had been ratified by 80 parties, which includes 79 states and the European Union.
The full name of the agreement is: 
The United Nations Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks
Straddling stocks are fish stocks that migrate through, or occur in, more than one exclusive economic zone. The Agreement was adopted in 1995, and came into force in 2001.
Highly migratory fish is a term which has its origins in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It refers to fish species which undertake ocean migrations and also have wide geographic distributions, and usually denotes tuna and tuna-like species, shark, marlin and swordfish. Straddling fish stocks are especially vulnerable to overexploitation because of ineffective management regimes and noncompliance by fishing interests.

Hardenhuish School

Hardenhuish School (formerly Chippenham Grammar School and Chippenham Girls' High School) is a large mixed secondary school and sixth form in Chippenham, Wiltshire, for students aged 11 to 18. Since September 2010, it has been an Academy. It is one of three in Chippenham, the others being Abbeyfield and Sheldon. The school is headed by Jan Hatherall. It is situated in the northern zone of Hardenhuish Park on the Hardenhuish Lane. The Great Western Ambulance Service HQ is nearby to the east, and Sheldon School nearby to the south.
History.
Earliest Records.
In 854AD, documents record the settlement known as Hardenhuish on the north-west side of Chippenham. The name probably derives from the family holding of one Herejeard', who occupied the land.
In 1066, the Domesday survey establishes the owner as Arnulf who held it before this date. The medieval manor house and church were situated on the flat land which now form Sheldon School's playing fields.
18th Century.
In 1707, the Colborne family purchased the estate and selected a new site for a fine Georgian house, Hardenhuish House, on higher ground to the north, built in 1773 to 1774.
In 1777, Joseph Colborne, of Hardenhuish became Sheriff of Wiltshire.
In 1779, Joseph Colborne, decided that a new church should also be erected on higher ground to the west of his new Georgian house. Dedicated to Saint Nicholas, it was designed by the famous Bath architect John Wood and is supposed to contain recycled material from the earlier church.
19th Century.
In 1822, the Clutterbuck family bought the Hardenhuish estate.
In 1826, Thomas Clutterbuck, of Hardenhuish became Sheriff of Wiltshire.
In 1854, Edmund Lewis Clutterbuck, of Hardenhuish became Sheriff of Wiltshire.
From 1875 a private venture grammar school existed in Chippenham, conducted in St. Mary Street by a Mr. Wilson and from 1883 by Mr. Cruikshank.
In 1891 the Technical Instruction Acts (1889 & 1891) provided financial assistance for evening classes in various science and arts subjects. Earlier voluntary classes that had existed were now coordinated, and this became the beginning of a national system of technical education. Subjects included Shorthand, Animal Physiology, Chemistry, Physics, Hygiene, Carpentry and Dressmaking.
In 1893, Edward Newall Tuck was appointed by the Education Committee of the Borough of Chippenham to organise technical classes in Chippenham and district. Classes were held in rented premises at No. 21 London Road and at the Jubilee Institute, as well as villages including Grittleton and Yatton Keynell. Teachers from elementary schools attended classes in a School of Art on Saturdays at the Jubilee Institute. Tuck, in addition, gave talks on Wiltshire history and nature study, he also served as town councillor and was Mayor of Chippenham from 1931 to 1932.
In 1894, pupils were not admitted to classes until they reached the age of 11. Pupils from day schools were admitted free from aged 11 to 16. The fees at this time were fixed at 6d per month, the whole expenses of the school being met by fees and grants from the Science and Art Department and the County Council. Higher grade classes for boys, including Woodwork and Chemistry, were held at No. 21 London Road.
John Coles.
In 1896, under the provisions of the Technical and Industrial Institutions Act (1892), the Borough of Chippenham established the Chippenham and District County School, subsequently known as the Chippenham County Secondary School for Boys and Girls, with Tuck as the first headmaster (He would remain in this post until 1939). The first Chair of Governors was former mayor Alderman John Coles.
The premises were still located at No. 21 London Road and the Jubilee Institute. As the tenancy of the private venture school was to end on 25 March 1896, the Town Council paid Cruikshank £10 for the desks, books and goodwill of his school. Boys were drawn from three elementary schools in Chippenham, the British, National and St. Paul's Schools. In addition twelve boys had previously attended the private grammar school. Others were from other private schools in Chippenham, Corsham, Devizes, Calne and surrounding villages. 39 boys aged 11 to 16 were on the admission register from 13 April 1896. The curriculum included Latin, French, Science, History, Geography, Grammar, Book-keeping, Shorthand, Arithmetic, Writing, Geometry and Freehand Drawing.
In September 1898, a girls' school was established, against some opposition, in the Temperance Hall, Foghamshire. 22 girls were admitted at opening, from the schools of Mrs. Parry (Market Place), Miss Alexander (Monkton Hill), Mrs. White (Marshfield Road), from private tuition and from local National and British schools.
20th Century.
On 24 September 1900, the Chippenham District County School opened in Cocklebury Lane, now part of Wiltshire College, (built on an acre of land purchased in 1896 by the County, Urban and Rural District Councils). The ceremony was attended by the Mayor and Aldermen of Chippenham. In addition to Mr. Edward Newall Tuck the headmaster, the staff included three masters and one mistress, there were 99 pupils. The total cost of the project was £6,000. In addition to the buildings and playground, four acres of adjoining land were rented for playing fields. All day classes were consolidated here and pupil numbers increased rapidly.
On 1 May 1901 the decision was taken by the Governors for the school to become a Science School. 4 scholarships were granted to 3 female and 1 male students. In July it was decided to establish a centre for pupil-teachers at the school.
In 1902, Local Education Authorities were established and Wiltshire County Council became responsible for education in Chippenham. 
Latin was omitted from the curriculum.
By 1904 there were 101 pupils, 50 from urban and 51 from rural areas. In addition 49 pupil teachers were attending, 9 from urban and the remainder from rural schools, and the evening classes had 139 pupils.
From 1905 girls from elementary schools attended Cookery classes at the Cocklebury Road site.
In 1906, Sir Gabriel Goldney, 2nd Baronet, CVO, CB of Hardenhuish Park became Sheriff of Wiltshire.
By October 1907 the school had 128 pupils, 64 boys and 64 girls. The age of admission was 9, and the leaving age 17 to 18.
In addition to the yearly fees paid by pupils the school was financed by County and Government grants.
In 1908 the fees were £5 5s. 0d. a year, including books. However, there were a number of scholarships available and figures for the year show that of 115 pupils, 66 girls and 49 boys, 57 held scholarships, one a free place, and only 57 were fee-payers.
The Interwar Years.
In 1922, the school received further County and Government grants.
In the interwar years, numbers of pupils on roll increased steadily, and by 1929 there were 262. The Junior department was reorganised as a Kindergarten and Preparatory Form, catering for 61 children aged 8 to 10. However, the number of pupils over the age of 16 was proportionally small in comparison with the average for Wiltshire Grammar Schools, consequently there was no discrete sixth form, although a small number of pupils did progress to University, some with the aid of County Scholarships.
By the early 1930s the buildings were presenting difficulties of overcrowding.
By 1935 pupil numbers had reached 288, Hardenhuish Park was purchased from the Clutterbuck family by Wiltshire County Council in order to implement the educational requirements of the growing town.
Grammar School.
In 1938, the Secondary Grammar School moved from Cocklebury Road to new buildings (since demolished), erected on the east side of Hardenhuish House. 
The old Manor House became the headmaster's room, the school library and some classrooms.
The new school extended over 40 acres of Hardenhuish Park, new buildings contained a hall, gymnasium, laboratories, classrooms, and cloakrooms.
In 1939, the Preparatory department closed.
By 1940 there were 414 pupils, of whom 25 were evacuees, 10 percent were under the age of 11 and, still, only 2 percent over 16.
The Cocklebury Road premises became Chippenham County Secondary Modern School, a senior mixed school taking children aged 11 and over from the primary schools of Chippenham and district.
In late 1940, early 1941 the school took in a large number of evacuees from Wanstead, East London, who had already spent a year in Gloucester.
A field next to school housed a camp occupied by soldiers of the 4th Armored Division and 11th Armored Division, whose headquarters were at Lackham House and Manor. Close relations developed between these troops and the school.
Post WWII.
Following the war, there was a steady increase in the numbers of pupils and additional buildings were constructed. The catchment area of the school covered the triangle between Chippenham, Corsham and Melksham.
In 1956, with pupil number at 547, (102 of these in the Sixth Form), constant growth of the area saw the major development of a new secondary modern school for girls to the south of Hardenhuish Church
On 28 September, the new Girls' High School opened. These buildings now form part of Hardenhuish School.
The Headmistress, Miss E. Denne, had 486 pupils in her charge.
In 1958, a field was purchased at the Folly to enable an approach road to be made to serve the new secondary schools.
Chippenham Boys' High School.
In 1959, a secondary modern, Chippenham Boys' High School, was constructed lower down Hardenhuish Park. These buildings now form part of Sheldon School.
In 1960, more Grammar School buildings were erected behind Hardenhuish House due to the continual growth of Chippenham. The school began to admit 120 instead of 90 each year. 
The three schools occupied some 40 acres of Hardenhuish Park and some 2000 boys and girls attended from the Borough and from the district within a radius of about 8 miles.
In 1966, the Grammar School and the Girls' High School integrated with the Chippenham Secondary Modern Schools in a semi-comprehensive system with all 11 to 13 year old boys and girls being educated on the Hardenhuish site. 
Comprehensive.
In 1975, the three existing schools were merged into two comprehensive schools, under the names Hardenhuish and Sheldon. Hardenhuish was made up of the old Grammar School and Girls' High School buildings, spanning right across the old Hardenhuish estate and comprising seven blocks.
The 1975 Chippenham development plan stated, "Two mixed 8 form entry comprehensive schools each to accommodate 1200 pupils aged 11 to 18, with 200 in each school sixth form additionally, to be formed on the campus at Hardenhuish by merging the existing three schools. The Boys’ High School to have additional classrooms and accommodation for girls. The Girls’ High School and the Chippenham School to be merged into one school".
Hardenhuish would serve the northern and western areas of Chippenham and adjacent villages. Sheldon would take pupils from the southern and eastern areas of the town and adjacent villages.
In September 1975 Hardenhuish School opened as a comprehensive school in the Grammar School and Girls’ High School buildings, and renamed to reflect the school having become coeducational.
A £2 million capital building project over the last decade has transformed the learning environment.
Completed in 2003, the new Technology Centre began the first phase, soon followed by the new Sports Hall with climbing wall, the new English and Performing Arts Centre, and the extensively redeveloped Science and Maths Centres. The school was awarded Specialist School Status as a Mathematics and Computing College.
The most recent, completed in 2009, a new two-storey Sixth Form Centre, has given Hardenhuish some of the most impressive facilities in the county., in April the school added a second specialism in Science.
Academy.
In September 2010, Hardenhuish accepted Michael Gove's invitation to opt out of Local Authority Control and convert to academy status, becoming one of the first Outstanding Specialist Academies as part of the coalition government’s flagship programme.
Ofsted and Academic Performance.
Hardenhuish received the tenth highest A-level average results for comprehensives in Wiltshire at the end of the 2009/2010 school year. As well as expertise in the specialisms of Mathematics & Computing and Science, Hardenhuish has received many awards over recent years, some of which are the ICT Mark in 2010, designated a Lead School for Gifted & Talented learners, and the International School Award every year since 2010. In its 2008 Ofsted report, Hardenhuish was judged to be "outstanding".

Ansar or Insar (Arabic أنصار, population 31,970) is a village in the Nabatieh Governorate region of southern Lebanonlocated between Nabatieh and Tyr. During the Lebanese civil war in the 1980s it was the location of a detention camp for suspected Palestinian terrorists and allied Muslim militiamen captured by the Israeli military in Lebanon. Prisoners were categorised and then either moved to more secure facilities or released. In August 1983, after several escape tunnels were discovered underground, the 5,000 inmates it had held at the time were moved. An Israel Army reservist who had served at Ansar was quoted in the newspaper "Maariv" claiming the camp was sitting on top of an underground tunnel system.
In 2006, it was bombarded by Israel during escalating conflicts and 5 people were killed
Ansar is the hometown of the poet and journalist Said fayad (1921 - 2003).

Artisteer

Artisteer is a WYSIWYG website theme creation tool developed by Extensoft.
Artisteer automates creating Web templates, including a "Suggest Design" button, which randomly generates Web design and displays the design preview. The user can then adjust the design using variety of options, and export the design as either a Web template in XHTML and CSS format, or a WordPress theme.
Artisteer is available for the Windows operating system. A beta version of Artisteer for Mac OS 10.5 is making slow progress and can be downloaded.
The first version of Artisteer was released in September 2008. Artisteer version 3.0 was released on June 2011. The current version is Artisteer 4.1 for Windows and 3.1 Beta for Macintosh.
Overview and features.
As an automated WYSIWYG editor, Artisteer hides the details of pages' HTML code from the user, making it possible for non-coders to create web templates and blog themes. The application makes it very easy to create tableless layouts. The created code complies with W3C standards.
Artisteer allows users to preview websites in many browsers, provided that they are installed on their computer. 
Unlike other HTML editors, Artisteer does not create fully functional Web sites, but creates Web templates that are then to be either manually integrated with a Web applications or applied to a CMS system. Artisteer also provides an option to export Wordpress themes, which do not require further modifications and can be applied to a Wordpress system by copying them directly into Wordpress "themes" folder.
Automation.
Artisteer allows for some automation of web design in the sense of being able to successfully assemble a usable Web template from random elements without user intervention. The user invokes the automation feature by selecting the "Suggest Design" option, and can then review the suggested random design. Theoretically this method can produce an unlimited number of original Web designs.
The term "Web Design Automation" (a registered mark of iRadek Software), is now more and more commonly being used to describe these and other forms of software that essentially remove the need to perform many of the traditional task associated with web design and web deployment.
Language availabilities.
Artisteer is available in the following languages:

Fukusa

, are a type of Japanese textile used for gift-wrapping or for purifying equipment during a Japanese tea ceremony. Fukusa are square or almost square pieces of lined fabric ranging in size from about 9 inches to 36 inches on a side.
For covering gifts.
Traditionally in Japan, gifts were placed in a box on a wooden or lacquer tray, over which a fukusa was draped. The choice of a fukusa appropriate to the occasion was an important part of the gift-giving ritual. The practice of covering a gift became widespread during the Edo or Tokugawa period (1615–1867).
The scene or the motifs depicted on fukusa are chosen to indicate either the occasion for which the gift is being given, or because they are appropriate for one of the annual festivals, when gifts are exchanged. The richness of the decoration of the fukusa attests to the giver’s wealth and aesthetics. 
After being admired, a fukusa, along with its box and tray, were typically returned to the donor. However, when gifts were presented to a high official, the fukusa was not always returned. This was one of the subtle devices used to control the wealth of the lords and samurai.
In the first part of the 18th century, the art of the fukusa reflected the taste of the aristocratic minority of Japan: the daimyo and samurai. The subtle cultural references inherent in the designs were recognizable only to the educated members of these classes, who lived and exchanged gifts in the cities of Kyoto and Edo (Tokyo) and their surrounding areas. The use of ornamental fukusa in the Edo era was almost entirely confined to these geographic areas. 
By the 19th century, the merchant class moved up the social ladder and adopted customs of the aristocracy, including gift giving with fukusa. Family crests, or mon, were added on the lining side of gift covers beginning in the late 18th century and tassels were placed at each corner so the gift covers could be picked up without touching the fabric. Today, fukusa are rarely used, and when they are it is almost exclusively around Tokyo and Kyoto for gifts given at the time of marriage.
In the Edo era, textiles were an integral part of Japanese art. There was no arbitrary division of art into fine arts and decorative arts, as is prevalent in Western art. Eminent artists were commissioned to design textiles and each work was an original creation. Unfortunately, artists seldom signed their work.
Satin silk was the fabric preferred for embroidery, which often made extensive use of couched gold- and silver-wrapped thread . As paste-resist (yuzen) dyeing became popular, crepe (chirimen) silk was favored. Tapestry weave (tsuzure-ori) tapestry also was a popular technique as well as weft brocade (nishiki).
For use in tea ceremony.
Fukusa can also refer to several types of silk cloths used in Japanese tea ceremony. 
Tsukai fukusa are usually undecorated squares of silk used to ritually purify tea utensils during a "temae" (tea-making procedure). Those used by men are usually deep purple, while those used by women are usually red or orange. Other colours are sometimes used, as are fukusa decorated with images.
Dashi fukusa are larger squares of silk with various patterns used by hosts and guests to handle chawan (tea bowls) during certain "temae", usually those involving the making of thick tea, in some tea traditions. 
Ko-bukusa are small squares of brocaded silk used by hosts and guests to handle chawan during certain "temae", usually those involving the making of thick tea, in some schools of Japanese tea ceremony instead of dashi fukusa.

David Wagner (tennis)

David Wagner (born March 4, 1974) is an American wheelchair tennis player. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down and with thirty percent function in his hands, he competes in the quadriplegic division of that sport. He plays by taping the tennis racket to his hand. He is currently ranked number one in the world in doubles and number two in singles behind Peter Norfolk of the United Kingdom.
Wagner was born in Fullerton, California, and grew up in Walla Walla, Washington. He played basketball in high school and tennis in college. He became a quadriplegic at age 21 while visiting a friend in Redondo Beach, California, during summer break. He and his friends were playing frisbee on the beach and Wagner began chasing after the frisbee through shallow water. He attempted to jump over a wave, but the wave caught his feet, spun him around, and he landed head-first in the sand, leaving him paralyzed. He took a year off of college and began practicing table tennis as part of his rehabilitation. He won a national competition in that sport three years in a row, from 1997 to 1999.
In 1999, at age 25, he attended a wheelchair tennis training camp set up by Rick Draney, then the top-ranked quadriplegic tennis player in the world. Wagner immediately loved the sport and by 2002 was the number one ranked U.S. quadriplegic player. At the 2004 Summer Paralympics he won a gold medal in quad doubles with Nick Taylor and a silver medal in singles. The next year he reached number one in the world rankings in both singles and doubles and repeated that achievement in 2007. Also in 2007, he participated in the first quad competitions held at the U.S. Open, winning doubles with Taylor and taking second in singles behind Peter Norfolk. Wagner had successfully urged the United States Tennis Association to include a quadriplegic division at the event; the U.S. Open was the first of the Grand Slam tournaments to do so. The Australian Open followed suit the next year, and Wagner again lost the first place match of the singles competition to Norfolk and won doubles with Taylor. At the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, he and Taylor won gold in doubles and competed against each other in the bronze medal match of the singles event, with Wagner taking the match and the medal. As of January 2011, Wagner is ranked first in singles and doubles.
Wagner worked as an elementary school teacher until 2004, when he began competing in tennis full-time. He currently lives in Hillsboro, Oregon.

<doc id="19966504" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19966504" title="Baikunthapur Forest">
Baikunthapur Forest

Baikunthapur is a Terai forest region in the western part of the Dooars in West Bengal, India, south of the Himalayan foothills, between the Mahananda River to the west and Teesta River to the east. The main towns in the area are Siliguri and Jalpaiguri. The forests are partly in the Darjeeling district and partly in the Jalpaiguri district.
Baikunthapur is an important ecological zone, home to many wild elephants, but is threatened by growth of the local population. The least disturbed areas are in the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary. Historically, the Baikunthapur forests were the secure base of the Raikat princes in the time when Koch Bihar was an independent kingdom. Lord Krishna is also said to have found refuge in the forest at one time.
Geology and Climate.
The northern part of West Bengal is covered by fans of sediment washed down from the Himalayas. The Baikanthapur formation is the youngest fan in the area. It consists of very fine white sand inter-layered with ochre yellow sticky silty clay and overlain by dark grey to thick silty loam. The Shangaon formation represents the deposits of the flood plain faces of the Baikunthapur formation. Measurements have shown a maximum arsenic content well beyond the permissible limit (0.05 mg/L, Indian standard) within a depth range of 10–30m, in the Shaugaon surface. This raises concerns about the possibility of arsenic poisoning in the region and in downstream locations.
There are three main seasons: Summer, Monsoons and Winter. The summer season extends from first week of March to the second week of June, with April being the hottest month. Summer temperatures range in the mid-thirties. The Monsoons (June–September) bring severe rain. 125mm or more may fall in 24 hours, bringing all activity to halt and often causing local floods and landslides. Annual rainful may exceed 250 cm. Winters (September–February) can be chilly, with cold winds from the Himalayas. Temperatures may fall as low as 5 degrees Celsius during this period.
The land use pattern has changed dramatically since discovery of the potential for growing tea and reduction of the incidence of malaria. At one time, the area was one of dense forests, lakes and marshes laced with constantly shifting rivers. In the last fifty years, a huge influx of people have drastically changed the environment. Today, the area is just 25% forest, 15% tea garden, 43% cultivated and non-cultivated land and 17% water bodies, residential, hill etc.

Pan back for broader and broader views until the channels of the Brahmaputra are visible at the foot of the image. Along the line between the mountains and the plain you will see patches of dark green - the remaining Terai forests. One hundred years ago, there would have been a continuous and much wider band of dark green. Forests like the Baikanthapur with all their diversity of life and value in moderating water flow continue to be eroded by the growing human population.
History.
It is believed that Lord Krishna went into hiding in the jungles of Baikunthapur with his principal wife and queen Rukminiat one time. For this reason, ISKCON chose nearby Siliguri as the site for the biggest Krishna Centre in the Northeast.
The Raikat family were local rulers in the Baikunthapur area between 1523 and 1771, semi-independent rulers related to the Koch dynasty of the Kamata kingdom. The Raikat capital was at Siliguri, then deep within impenetrable forests between the rivers Mahananda to the west and Teesta to the west. During the 1680s, when the Bhutias were trying to take control of Koch Bihar, the Raikats intervened and tried to establish their own candidate for the throne. After a confused struggle, the Raikats withdrew and accepted the authority of the Fauzdar of Ghoraghat, perhaps only nominally.
The Raikats moved their capital south to Jalpaiguri around 1720. The Faujdar of Rangpur pressured the Raikats to accept the suzerainty of the Nawab of Bengal sometime between 1736 and 1739, but the Faujdar had to invade the territory in 1756 to enforce the claim. The Raikats still paid only partial tribute. In 1771 the British annexed Baikanthapur and the Raikats became Zamindars (tenants) of Baikunthapur, but remained largely independent. As late as 1839, the British government in India complained that the Raikat had taken possession of the western Duars of Bhutan.
In the 1850s commercial exploitation of Darjeeling tea began in the area. The British Raj assumed increasing control under their system of district commissioners, succeeded by the state of India in 1947.
The last Raikat of Baikunthapur, died intestate in 1946. The family home is still occupied, but is suffering from disrepair. However, the crumbling Rajbari (palace) in Jalpaiguri is a popular sightseeing spot for tourists and locals. The palace grounds hold the large palace building, its portico, a bushy garden, and two temples. The gate is a huge unreinforced concrete arch structure. There are several lakes in the Palace ground, one maintained by the government.
Environmental Degradation.
The Baikunthapur forests have shrunk considerably. They have always been vulnerable to shifts in river courses, but the swampy wet land helps the natural forest to regrow. However, recent deforestation of a huge area is causing ecological imbalances, and also changing weather conditions. Land clearing, terracing, mining and construction are all contributing to soil erosion and degraded water quality.
Joint Forest Management (JFM) activities started in the Baikunthapur area in 1994-95. The efforts have not been fully effective, perhaps because the Forest Department has not sufficiently involved the local population or explained the purpose of the program. Natural forests in the Baikunthapur and Jalpaiguri Forest Divisions, where more than 30% of forest area is under JFM, are being ruined by illegal and destructive felling and uncontrolled grazing. Production of agricultural residue for use as household fuel is negligible. Forests serve as the main source of fuelwood for local people in Jalpaiguri, Baikunthapur, Cooch Bihar (Wildlife) and Darjeeling Forest Divisions. According to a study carried out by the Indian Institute of Forest Management, 93% of households collect wood for fuel from forests in the Baikunthapur area. The quantity of wood extracted does not appear to be sustainable.
Each year, teams from the Baikunthapur forest division seize illegal consignments of lumber worth lakhs of rupees from the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary and the adjacent Baikunthapur Forest Reserve in West Bengal. However, far more wood is sold than seized.Again, some argue that this is because the land tenure system does not encourage proper stewardship by the local inhabitants. In the past, there have been abuses by the army and officials. But the overwhelming factor has been explosive population growth.
Elephant Issues.
The elephant population in West Bengal is healthy and expanding. This is causing problems. Elephant depredation or the destruction of human settlements and raiding of agricultural crops has been occurring since ancient times, but the increase in both human and elephant populations in recent years is causing a growing number of incidents. Human-elephant clashes have become a regular feature in the tea gardens of Jalpaiguri district. There is a growing number of reports of poisoning and electrocution of the elephants by farmers trying to protect their fields. In July 2008, an elephant that had strayed out of the Baikunthapur forest range near Jalpaiguri trampled to death one man and injured another who came in its way. The Siliguri-Alipurduar broad gauge line cuts across the corridor that connects the Apalchand Reserve Forest of Baikunthapur Forest Division and the Mal Block of Kalimpong Forest Division. In seven years up to 2008, 26 elephants have been killed by trains on this line.
Gajoldoba Reservoir.
Gajoldoba is a reservoir formed by the first Teesta Barrage, which was built for irrigational purposes. It is surrounded by the Baikunthapur forests, and is an hour's drive from Siliguri. The reservoir is used by many water birds from Ladakh and Central Asia including Brahmini duck, Bar-headed Goose, Poachard, Pintail, Shoveler, Mallard, Black Ibis, and many species of Stork, Cormorant and Duck.

Timeline of the Mongol Empire

This is the timeline of the Mongol Empire from 1206, when Temüjin received the title of Chinggis Khan, to the death in 1370 of the last emperor of Yuan Dynasty in China, who had been deposed in 1368. The Yuan emperors used the title of Khagan (Great Khan, or Emperor) of the Mongols as successors to Genghis as overlord of all the Mongol dominions, though after the death of Kublai Khan in 1294, their suzerainty over the other divisions of the Mongol Empire (initially the Chagatai Khanate, the Golden Horde, and the Ilkhanate) was almost notional. The Mongol Empire is usually considered to have come to an end in 1368, though the title of Khagan continued to be used by the rulers of Northern Yuan Dynasty in Mongolia, a far less powerful successor entity, until 1634.

Marquis de Choisy

Brig. Gen. Claude Gabriel marquis de Choissey () was at the siege of Yorktown in command of Lauzun's Legion and Gen. George Weedon's Virginia militia, at Gloucester, Virginia, under the command of Rochambeau, opposite Banastre Tarleton.
Capture of Cracow.
France was allied with Poland against Russia, in the Bar Confederation. On 2 February 1772, he led 270 men, in the capture of Kraków Poland, from 1,500 Russians. A small party entered through a sewer, surprised the guard, and opened the postern gate. Not being reinforced in time, they retreated to the citadel, Wawel Castle. They held it through a siege of several weeks against 18,000 Russians, until it fell to Suvorov on 28 April 1772.
On 24 March 1772, he was appointed Brigadier General of Infantry, and in 1779 appointed to be Mestre of the Camp for the Fourth Regiment Chasseurs a Cheval.
Joining the "Expédition Particulière".
Competition was fierce among French officers to join the expedition to America, to gain fame and promotion. Marquis de Choisy arrived at Brest with five others officers to join the Army, but was turned away. Then he sailed, with ten officers, on the "Sybille" for Santo Domingo, changing ships to "La Gentille", arriving at Newport on 29 September 1780.
Tensions ran high among officers in camp; he sought to reconcile officers who had fought a duel.
On 29 October, Rochambeau sent Brigadier General Choisy with Lauzun's Legion, as they marched from Rhode Island to Head of Elk, Maryland, traveled by water to Alexandria, Virginia, and marched to Glouchester Courthouse.
Skirmish with Tarleton.
Glouchester point was an obvious escape route from Yorktown. Marquis de Choisy was assigned the Virginia militia, Lauzun's Legion, and 800 French Marines. Opposite them was Tarleton's Legion, Simcoe's Rangers, the 80th Foot regiment, and the Erb Prinz (Prince Hereditaire) regiment.
On 4 October 1781, Marquis de Choisy was marching towards Gloucester by the Severn road (Route 17), while John Mercer, with the Virginia militia, "veterans", took the York River road. Tarleton, who had crossed the river the night before, led a covering force for a "grand forage", for supplies.
Lauzun and Tarleton charged and countercharged over the open ground. Tarleton was unhorsed, and Lauzun's Legion skirmished allowing the infantry to fire upon the British. Tarleton withdrew within his lines, and the French pursued, before being ordered to withdraw by the Marquis de Choisy.
The British lost killed or wounded one officer and eleven men; the French lost two officers and fourteen hussars.
Marquis de Choisy wrote Washington:
Sir, I have the hounor to inform you that by our arrival at Saoul's Tavern we have met with the ennemi who was in number about 500 men Cavalry and Infantry, that the Cavalry of the Duc of Lauzun has attaqued them, pierced through and that we have had a great advantage on them We can esteem they have 30 men killed or wounded The 200 men grenadier Americans who were the only Infantry advanced enough to have part in the affair and who have behaved excedingly well have killed one officer who was at the head of the Infantry of the ennemi. T'is a general report that Tarleton has been wounded. The ennemi have retired to Gloucester and we are quickly in our Camp where I expect you will join to morrow as we have already agreed.
I have the hounor to be your
Most humble servant,
Choisy 
After the battle.
Washington corresponded with him about captured horses after the battle.
There was some controversy, about horses and lodging, and returning runaway slaves.
He returned to France with the Comte de Rochambeau, from Annapolis, sailing in January, 1783.
He was presented the medal, "Libertas Americana", by Benjamin Franklin. He was promoted to "Maréchal de Camp" (major general) on 5 December 1781, and commander in 1784. He was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Louis. He was promoted to be Lieutenant General, 20 May 1791, and honorably retired on 4 February 1793.
Général of the French Révolution.
The revolutionary government, which had just published, on 26 October 1791 the decree cementing Avignon and Comtat Venaissin with France, dispatched "civil police chiefs" who were escorted by troops placed under the command of the general Choisy (with the 9th regiment of dragoons). Arriving on the spot, they ordered, after the Massacres of La Glacière, arrests, but on 19 March 1792, a general amnesty was voted by the National Assembly putting a rest to the inquiry.

Sébastien Lespès

Sébastien-Nicolas-Joachim Lespès was a French admiral who played an important role in naval operations during the Sino-French War (August 1884–April 1885), as second-in-command of Admiral Amédée Courbet's Far East Squadron.
Early career.
Sébastien Lespès was borne on 13 March 1828 at Bayonne (Basses-Pyrénées). He attended the École Navale, passing out as a midshipman ("aspirant") on 1 August 1846. In 1850, after serving successively on the warships "Inflexible", "Friedland", "Océan" and "Psyché" with the French Squadron of Evolutions ("escadre d'évolutions"), he took part in the Senegal campaign aboard the brig "Aigle". He received his promotion to "enseigne de vaisseau" during the course of this campaign, on 26 October 1850.
During the Crimean War (1854-6) he saw service aboard the warship "Valmy" in the Black Sea, and also distinguished himself ashore with the French naval batteries at the Siege of Sebastopol. He was promoted "lieutenant de vaisseau" on 2 December 1854, and was also decorated with the cross of a chevalier of the Legion of Honour.
He was posted to the Far East in 1857 and saw active service in the Second Opium War and the Cochinchina campaign, serving successively aboard the warships "Audacieux", "Némésis", "Dordogne" and "Duchayla". He was present with "Némésis" at the attack on the Pei-ho forts and at the capture of Da Nang (September 1858), and with "Duchayla" at the capture of the Kien Chan forts during the Siege of Tourane (18 November 1859).
In April 1860 he was appointed to the command of the aviso "Norzagaray" and given the task of scouting the river routes of Cambodia.
He was promoted "capitaine de frégate" on 27 January 1864 and took part in the Iceland campaign, for two summers, as second officer of "Pandore". He was then appointed by Commandant d'Ariès as chief of staff of the West Coast naval division ("division navale du littoral ouest de la France").
In 1869 he sailed for Shanghai with the corvette "Dupleix" as flag captain and chief of staff to Rear Admiral Krantz, who had recently assumed command of the China and Japan Seas naval division. He therefore saw no action during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In the early 1870s "Dupleix" left the division to undergo repairs, and was replaced by "Montcalm". Lespès remained in command of "Montcalm" until 1876.
During this tour of duty in the Far East, on 20 May 1873, Lespès was promoted "capitaine de vaisseau".
In 1876, following his return to Toulon, he assumed command of the frigate "Revanche", one of the warships of France's squadron of evolutions ("escadre d'évolutions"). "Revanche" was seriously damaged by a boiler explosion in May 1877, and Lespès was subsequently given command of the ironclad "Héroïne", also with the squadron of evolutions (May 1877–May 1878).
During the next five years Lespès held two important administrative posts on the "Conseil des travaux de la marine" and the "Conseil d'Amirauté". He also held successive command of the first-class ironclads "Redoutable" and "Amiral Duperré".
He was promoted rear admiral ("contre-amiral") on 7 December 1881.
Command of Far East naval division.
On 7 March 1884 Lespès arrived in Hong Kong aboard his flagship "La Galissonnière" to replace Admiral Charles Meyer in command of France's Far East naval division. After his arrival the naval division consisted of the ironclads "La Galissonnière" and "Triomphante", the cruisers "d'Estaing", "Duguay-Trouin" and "Volta", and the gunboat "Lutin".
The Tonkin Coasts and Far East naval divisions were both placed under Admiral Courbet's command in July 1884, as war with China loomed, and the two divisions were formally united into a Far East Squadron in August 1884.
Sino-French War.
Lespès did not possess Admiral Courbet's tactical brilliance, and his record as a naval commander during the Sino-French War was mixed. On 5 August 1884 he successfully destroyed the Chinese forts at Keelung, and landed a force of sailors to occupy the town. On 6 August the Chinese counterattacked, and Lespès was forced to re-embark his landing force.
On 29 August 1884, while Courbet's squadron was fighting its way successfully down the Min River after its victory in the Battle of Fuzhou, Lespès came up from Keelung with his flagship "La Galissonnière" and attempted to force his way into the river. "La Galissonnière" came under fire from the Chinese forts at the entrance to the river, received several hits, and was forced to withdraw.
On 8 October 1884 Lespès was in overall command of the French attack on Tamsui, which was ignominiously repulsed by the Chinese. The Battle of Tamsui was an embarrassing defeat for the French, and Courbet seems to have realised the limitations of his subordinate commander. Thereafter Lespès was given relatively unexacting duties. In February and early March 1885, while Courbet hunted down several Chinese ships of the Nanyang Fleet and brought them to action in the Battle of Shipu and the Battle of Zhenhai, Lespès was left in command of the blockade of Formosa. In late March 1885, in the Pescadores Campaign, Courbet took personal command of the naval expedition. Again, Lespès was left behind to direct the blockades of Formosa and the Yangzi River.
Command of the Far East Squadron.
After Courbet's death on 11 June 1885, Lespès briefly assumed command of the Far East Squadron. He delivered a moving tribute to his predecessor at a memorial service for Courbet at Makung on 13 June attended by the sailors of the Far East Squadron and the marine infantry of the Formosa expeditionary corps that had fought the Pescadores Campaign. His command lasted just over a month. On 25 July 1885 the French government reconstituted the traditional Far East naval division at close to its 1883 strength, and Lespès resumed command of his old division, with Admiral Adrien-Barthélémy-Louis Rieunier as his second-in-command. The postwar Far East naval division consisted of the ironclads "La Galissonnière" (Lespès' flagship), "Turenne" (Rieunier's flagship) and "Triomphante", the cruisers "Lapérousse", "Primauguet", "Champlain" and "Roland", and the gunboats "Vipère" and "Sagittaire".
Personality and views.
Lespès tended to make a good impression on those who made his acquaintance. On 9 August 1884, four days after the French bombardment of the Keelung forts, the Canadian missionary George MacKay was invited aboard "La Galissonnière" in Keelung harbour and met Lespès. MacKay, who was accompanied by a Taiwanese student, was struck by the French admiral's humanity:
Four days after the bombardment, in company with an Englishman, I went around the coast in a steamship, and was allowed to go on shore to examine the smoking fortifications. Soldiers were lying on their faces, with bodies shattered. Evidently they had been fleeing when exploded shells ended their lives. These shells were sent with such terrific force as to cut off branches of a tree that were half a foot in diameter. A magazine that had exploded hurled masses of concrete to an incredible distance. The Englishman and myself, with one of my students, were invited on board the flagship "La Galissonair" and taken through every part of the vessel. When we went down below our attention was directed to three holes, nearly a foot in diameter, just above the surface of the water, made by shells from the Chinese fort. The vice-admiral spoke in the highest terms of the gunners who aimed so truly. Though he was a man of war, this officer was also a man of sympathy; for when my student looked afraid as the soldiers under drill and their officers dashed to and fro with swords dangling at their sides, he said, 'Poor fellow! Tell him not to be afraid. We have no pleasure in killing people.'
Lespès was a reflective and sensitive man, with a good deal of human sympathy. According to Captain Fournier of the French cruiser "Éclaireur", who met George MacKay in Keelung on the eve of the French evacuation in June 1885, Lespès had made no secret of his distaste for Jules Ferry's aggressive policy towards China, and believed that France should not have fought the Sino-French War. This was also Fournier's view (he called the coercion of China 'a disgusting affair'), though it was not an opinion espoused by the majority of the officers of the Far East Squadron.

Muhammad Masihullah Khan

Muhammad Masihullah Khan Sherwani Jalalabadi (, "Muḥammad Masīhu’llāh Khān Shīrwānī Jalāl ābādī"; 1911/1912 – 12 November 1992) was an Indian Deobandi Islamic scholar known as an authority in Sufism. He was among the senior "khalifahs" of Ashraf Ali Thanvi, who gave him the title ""Masih al-Ummah"" ("Comforter of the "Ummah"").
Early life.
Muhammad Masihullah Khan was born in 1329 or 1330 AH (1911/1912) in Sara’i Barla, a village in the Aligarh district of Uttar Pradesh, India. His family was of the Sherwani tribe, a Sayyid tribe of Pathans. His father's name was Ahmad Sa`id Khan.
Masihullah was known for his piety in his youth, and he often sat in the company of the "ulama" and Sufis. He developed a close companionship with Muhammad Ilyas Kandhalvi, who introduced him to the books and lectures of Ashraf Ali Thanvi.
Education and training.
The greater part of Masihullah's Islamic education was undertaken in his hometown under Mufti Sa`id Ahmad Lucknowi. He then enrolled in Darul Uloom Deoband in 1347 AH (1928/1929). In the same year he took "bay`ah" (pledge of allegiance to a Sufi shaykh) on the hands of Ashraf Ali Thanvi.
At Darul Uloom Deoband, Masihullah's teachers included Husain Ahmad Madani, Muhammad I'zaz Ali Amrohi, Syed Mian Asghar Husain Deobandi, and Muhammad Ibrahim Baliyawi.
Masihullah graduated in Sha`ban 1351 AH (1932). On 25 Shawwal 1351 (February 1933), he was granted "khilafah" by Thanvi, his shaykh, and was thus authorized to take his own disciples. Despite Masihullah's young age, Thanvi listed him among his eleven most distinguished "khalifahs" (spiritual representatives). Thanvi had confidence in Masihullah's methods of spiritual training, and would sometimes refer disciples to Masihullah for training. 
Jalalabad.
Upon the direction of Thanvi, in 1357 AH (1938/1939) Masihullah moved to the town of Jalalabad in the district of Muzaffarnagar, due to the need for a teacher there. In Jalalabad, Masihullah took charge of a small, two-roomed school known as Madrasah Miftah al-`Ulum. Within thirty years the school developed from a simple "maktab" into a large madrasah with Islamic education offered from the elementary level up to the Alimiyah and Ifta levels.
In 1407 AH (1986/1987), Masihullah gave the responsibility for running the madrasah to his son so that he could devote more time to his "khanqah", where an increasingly large number of people were coming for spiritual reformation. Every Monday and Thursday, Masihullah would conduct a two- to three-hour gathering for instructing his disciples. Every Friday, after the "jumu`ah" prayer, he would have a gathering for the general public which would be attended by several hundred people from Jalalabad and the surrounding areas. 
Masihullah died on Thursday night, 12 November 1992. He was buried the next day after "jumu`ah". The "janazah" prayer was led by Mufti Inayatullah, and his funeral was attended by over 250,000 people. He was buried in the cemetery next to the madrasah.

Raukokore is a small settlement close to the East Cape in the northeastern North Island of New Zealand. It is located on State Highway 35, close to the mouth of the Raukokore River, 40 kilometres to the west of Hicks Bay. 
Raukokore's most notable feature is its Anglican church, a landmark of the East Cape region, which stands isolated close to the shore of Papatea Bay. The church was named as one of the East Cape/Gisborne region's "101 must-do" sites by the New Zealand Automobile Association.
The Raukokore church was built by a Captain Stirling from hand sawed timber and if one looks closely at the exterior planks saw teeth marks can be seen.Until a few years it was very run down but the local Stirling marae raised money and had it restored so that now its well used for church services and weddings.
At the back is a well kept Maori Stirling family cemetery, where most headstones have photos of the deceased. If you visit which welcomed if you follow the local Maori custom washing your hands as you leave.

Proposed railways in Sydney

Various railway lines have been proposed for Sydney, Australia, including both heavy rail extensions to the existing network, and more recently proposals for metro style lines.
Bradfield railway scheme, 1920s.
John Bradfield, engineer and designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, had a grand vision for Sydney's railway system that has only been partly fulfilled. After joining the New South Wales Public Works Department in 1891, he submitted a report in 1915 calling for the electrification of the suburban railways, a city underground railway and the Harbour Bridge. World War I led to the collapse of all three proposals, and it was not until 1922 that the Bridge Bill passed through Parliament, and 1923 until the first sod was turned on the city railway.
Bradfield's overall concept called for the construction of a network of underground city railway lines in association with the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and a new rail terminal, Central. A larger network of lines was proposed for the western, eastern and southern suburbs (see map) however most of these lines remained concepts only and have never been constructed. The Depression and later World War II, along with the growth of the motor car that led to the passenger numbers in Bradfield's plans being grossly overestimated, all prevented the full realisation of the Bradfield scheme. Parts of the city underground were constructed and exist as the present day City Circle, with small sections built for the additional proposed city lines such as additional platforms at Wynyard and St James stations which have never been used for heavy rail transport. The underground city loop was constructed originally as a stub line to St James, and the line through Town Hall and Wynyard to the Harbour Bridge. It was not until 1955 that the loop was completed by the construction of Circular Quay station. A line to the eastern suburbs was eventually built, but along a different alignment to that envisaged by Bradfield, who proposed a line along Oxford Street.
Sydney Area Transportation Study, 1974.
In 1968, the State Planning Authority of New South Wales released the "Sydney Region Outline Plan", which was to guide the development of Sydney for the period 1970–2000. In particular, it aimed to develop new growth corridors to areas such as Green Valley, Campbelltown and Blacktown. This was followed in 1974 by the "Sydney Area Transportation Study" which proposed several new rail lines in the new growth areas as well as several new lines to ease congestion in the established areas of Sydney. The proposed lines were:
The rail plans also involved significant duplication and quadruplication of existing lines. Despite extensive modelling, the vast majority of the proposals outlined were not constructed.
Eastern Suburbs Railway, 1960-70s.
In 1967, the NSW government recommenced construction on the dormant Eastern Suburbs line that had been partly constructed and had lain dormant since 1952. The original proposal was for a line to Kingsford via Bondi Junction, Randwick and the University of New South Wales. In 1976, the project was curtailed to Bondi Junction, and the full line to Kingsford was not constructed.
MetroWest proposal, 1990.
In 1990, the State Rail Authority undertook a feasibility study into the development of a new underground line along the western edge of the Central Business District. Called MetroWest, the proposal called for the construction of a new underground line between Redfern and Wynyard along the western edge of the CBD with a new underground station complex at Central station, new stations in the Haymarket and Market street areas, and terminating at a remodelled Wynyard station. The proposal would include platforms suitable to fit longer InterUrban passenger trains from the Central and South Coasts and the Blue Mountains, running through the new line in lieu of terminating at Central. The line underwent a two-year feasibility study and the corridor remains protected for possible future development with planning buffers placed along the corridor in 2006, however plans presently remain unrealised.
Action for Transport 2010, 1998.
In 1998, the NSW government released a position paper on various road and public transport projects to be delivered before 2010. The rail projects envisaged were:
Three projects were listed for consideration as additions after 2010:
Of these proposals, only the ones already under construction or advanced planning (the Airport line and the Epping- Chatswood section of the Parramatta Rail Link) are or will be completed. Most of the proposed roads and motorways outlined in the same paper have been constructed however.
Bondi Beach railway, 1996-7.
In 1996, the NSW government proposed a privately funded extension of the Eastern Suburbs railway from Bondi Junction to Bondi Beach. The final proposed version of the line would have seen a single track extension ending in a station under Bondi Beach park, with a premium (extra $2.50 proposed) added to ticket prices. The Bondi Beach Railway Company, owned by Lend Lease Infrastructure and the Macquarie Bank, proposed to build and maintain the railway at a cost of $197 million and to operate it for a 30-year term. The proposal met with fierce opposition from local residents who were concerned with the loss of parkland, fare premium, and little potential use by residents. After a degree of planning and gaining Federal Government backing, the proposal was dropped in 1999.
'Christie' proposals, 2002.
In 2002, the Co-ordinator General of Rail, Ron Christie, released a report, the "Long-Term Strategic Plan for Rail for Sydney, the Central Coast, Newcastle, the Illawarra, the South Coast and the Blue Mountains", which outlined the critical infrastructure that would need to be built between then and 2050 to ensure the long-term survival and operation of the CityRail network. Christie's report suggested that several "metro" lines should be built to service new areas and to relieve capacity on existing lines. In particular, Christie suggested lines:
Western FastRail.
Western FastRail was a privately operated underground rail tunnel proposed to run between the Sydney CBD and Parramatta, a distance of 26 km, with the high-speed link continuing to Penrith on the outskirts of Sydney. First introduced in 2004 by a consortium of Dutch bank ABN AMRO and developer Leighton Holdings, the project, dubbed the Penrith High Speed Link, was again floated in December 2006 and received favourable comments by the New South Wales State Government, and was offered funding by Federal Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd should the Australian Labor Party win the 2007 Federal Election.
The proposed link would ease congestion along the main West-East corridor and reduce the current 29 minute service into the city to just 12 minutes. The service would operate in conjunction with RailCorp, and would use CityRail's existing railway stations and ticketing system, but with an extra fee on top of the normal CityRail ticket price (at approximately $9.90 a trip including a $3.10 surcharge). The train fleet and rail infrastructure would be built and maintained by a private company. The line has been estimated to cost $5 billion.
Metropolitan Rail Expansion Programme, 2005.
On 15 June 2005, NSW Premier Bob Carr shortly before his resignation announced the Metropolitan Rail Expansion Programme (MREP). The MREP consisted of three new rail connections:
Estimated to cost about A$8 billion, $5 billion of which was for the building of a new tunnel under the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney central business district, (called the CBD Rail Link). Under this plan, the north-west suburbs would be served by the North West Rail Link by 2017, the new south-west suburbs would be linked to the network via the South West Rail Link by 2015, and the rail line would pass through the new growth corridor from Ryde to the airport. Critics of the New South Wales government have criticised what they perceive as a lack of follow through, citing the previously planned Parramatta to Chatswood rail link which has since been truncated to link only Epping to Chatswood, with the Epping to Parramatta portion postponed indefinitely.
It would also have included quadrupled lines between St Leonards and Chatswood on the North Shore line. In 2006, Premier Morris Iemma placed planning buffers along two potential corridors in the CBD (the MetroWest and MetroPitt routes) to secure future accessibility. Developers who want to excavate deeper than two metres within a 25-metre buffer zone of the corridors will need to seek RailCorp's approval.
Parramatta Rail Link (PRL).
In 2002 the State Government proposed a Parramatta-Epping-Chatswood link. That same year construction began on the latter half which was completed seven years later as the "Epping to Chatswood Railway Line". However the other half was postponed indefinitely in 2003 by the then-New South Wales Transport Minister Michael Costa citing a lack of projected passenger numbers and economic viability.
On 11 August 2010, the Federal Labor Government promised 2.6 billion dollars towards this project, which, along with the NSW State Labor Government, would have constructed a line from Parramatta to Epping through the Carlingford line. Work was due to start in 2011, with a prospected 2017 finish, but the NSW Liberal Government under Barry O'Farrell cancelled the project, instead requesting that Federal funding be diverted to a more expensive upgrade of the Pacific Highway. The Gillard Federal Government responded by revoking the funding altogether.
North West Rail Link (NWRL).
After its original announcement in 1998 for completion in 2010 as part of the "Action for Transport 2010" plan, in 2006 the schedule was revised for completion in 2017 and later brought forward to a staged plan for train services to Castle Hill and Hills Centre in 2015, and to Rouse Hill by 2017. It was planned to be 22 kilometres in length, consisting of a 16 kilometre section in tunnel from Epping to the proposed Burns Road Station, followed by a 4 kilometre section above ground from Burns Road to Rouse Hill. Six new stations were proposed to be constructed at Franklin Road, Castle Hill, Hills Centre, Norwest, Burns Road and Rouse Hill. A train stabling facility was proposed at the north west of Rouse Hill Town Centre. The NWRL was to connect with the Epping to Chatswood Rail Link through a direct tunnel between Epping and Franklin Road stations, although an original proposal connected with the existing Northern Line north of Cheltenham. The direct route was to use the stub tunnels originally built for the deferred Parramatta Rail Link between Parramatta and Epping. New stub tunnels for the Parramatta Rail Link were to be constructed so that if the Parramatta line were completed, trains from Parramatta would have also been able to link into the Epping-Chatswood Line.
It was proposed that the NWRL would offer an off peak rail service of four trains per hour, with six to eight trains per hour in peak periods and is expected to carry six to eight million passengers per year.
In 2008, the North West rail line was superseded by the now-cancelled North West Metro (see below). In 2010, the NWRL was resurrected as part of a new Metropolitan Transport Plan . In May 2011, the new Coalition Government released the proposed plan for comment and drilling commenced on 7 September 2011
South West Rail Link.
The "South West Rail Link" was announced as part of the Metropolitan Rail Expansion Programme to cater to the "South West Growth Centre". It was to consist of a 12-kilometre, twin-track railway running from Leppington and Edmondson Park to connect with the South line at Glenfield. The project also included a train stabling facility to the west of the new Leppington station, and a redesigned and expanded Glenfield station with flyovers to connect with the East Hills line.
On 31 October 2008, the Premier revealed that the South West Rail Link was to be 'indefinitely shelved' due to budetary constraints, and only an upgrade of the Glenfield Station car park is to proceed. On 14 November 2009, the then-New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees announced that construction of stage two of the South West Rail Link would begin in mid-2010, with completion scheduled for 2016.
CBD Rail link.
The third component to the MREP was the "CBD Rail link", a new underground railway line starting at Redfern Station, travelling under the Central Business District and under Sydney Harbour, through the Northern Sydney suburbs and ending at the existing Chatswood railway station. The six kilometre cross-tunnel was slated to cost $5 billion and was to include new or expanded stations at Redfern, Central, Pitt Street, Martin Place, Circular Quay, Victoria Cross, Crows Nest, St Leonards, Artarmon and Chatswood.
On 13 September 2007, it looked unlikely that the New South Wales government would commit to the line when they announced a proposal for a metro line that would span the harbour, the Anzac Line. (see below) On 19 March 2008 the State Government announced that the line would be on hold after construction begins on the North West Metro in 2010, its role to be partly superseded by that railway line. In October 2008, the North West Metro line itself was cancelled and replaced with a shorter CBD metro which would partly follow the alignment of the CBD Rail Link.
Metro proposals, 2008.
Anzac Line.
In 2007, the NSW government announced the concept of an underground metro line between West Ryde and Malabar. The line would have started at West Ryde station on the Northern Line before travelling beneath Victoria Road through Top Ryde, Gladesville, Drummoyne, Rozelle and Pyrmont . The line would then pass through existing city stations at Wynyard, Martin Place and St James, before heading south beneath Anzac Parade to Moore Park, the University of New South Wales in Kensington, Maroubra Junction and Malabar. No detailed design or planning was performed, and the western leg of the line (between West Ryde and the city) was adapted into planning for the North West Metro in 2008 (see below).
North West Metro.
In early 2008, the NSW State government announced plans to build a metro line between the North West suburbs of Sydney and the CBD. Known as the North West Metro, the line would have superseded the North West Line which was to be built as part of the Metropolitan Rail Expansion Programme, and included a new section between Epping and the CBD via Gladesville, approximately along the course of Victoria Road. Controversial from the start, the line was criticised for being too long, too expensive, and inappropriate for a low density suburban area.
The North West Metro was to have been 37 kilometres in length, with 32 kilometres underground and 5 kilometres above ground. The line was likely to have been operated without drivers. The North West Metro would have incorporate the alignment and stations previously proposed by the North West Rail Link but included the additional benefits of directly linking the North West with Gladesville, Drummoyne, Pyrmont and the CBD. There were proposed to be 17 new metro stations at St James, Martin Place, Wynyard, Pyrmont, Rozelle, Drummoyne, Henley, Gladesville, Top Ryde, Denistone East, Epping, Cherrybrook, Castle Hill, Hills Centre, Norwest, Kellyville and Rouse Hill.
According to the State Government press release announcing the North West Metro project, the metro line was to offer a rail service of one train every four to five minutes (three minutes during peak hours). However, there was debate as to whether advertised point-to-point transit times may have been too optimistic. It was to have run on conventional standard gauge track, similar to the existing CityRail network, but with single deck rolling stock.
In October 2008, the NSW Premier cast doubts upon the likelihood of constructing the North West Metro, and instead proposed a short metro line between Central station and Rozelle via Town Hall and East Darling Harbour (Barangaroo), with the potential for further westwards extension to Macquarie Park and Epping. On 31 October 2008, the Premier announced that the North West Metro would not proceed due to budgetary constraints.
CBD Metro.
On 23 October 2008, Premier Nathan Rees announced the CBD Metro, a shortened version of the North West Metro which would run from Rozelle to Central stations. It was submitted to Infrastructure Australia for funding, with construction proposed to commence in 2010. It was also announced that the line may be extended to link from Rozelle Station to Epping & Macquarie Park in the future. In December 2008, the project was placed on a short-list of projects to be funded by Infrastructure Australia's "Building Australia Fund".
West Metro.
After the announcement of the North West Metro, the State Government announced concepts for a metro line through the Inner Western suburbs of Sydney (to be known as the West Metro), and the potential for a South East Metro along the route of the before-mentioned Anzac Line beneath Anzac Parade. Like the CBD Metro, the West Metro was placed on a short-list of projects to be funded by Infrastructure Australia's "Building Australia Fund". in December 2008.
Despite geotechnical work having been performed and the acquisition of properties in progress, in February 2010, the NSW government announced that it had cancelled plans for metro construction (see below).
2031 Sydney Transport Blueprint, 2009.
In 2009 the Sydney Morning Herald revealed plans for a "Sydney Transport Blueprint" which the deposed NSW Premier Nathan Rees was to release in December 2009. The proposal was to include:
The proposals were to cost $180 billion over 25 years. In late 2009, Nathan Rees was deposed by Kristina Keneally casting doubt upon the blueprint.
Metropolitan Transport Plan: Connecting the City of Cities, 2010.
In February 2010, the NSW premier Kristina Keneally announced the "Metropolitan Transport Plan: Connecting the City of Cities". Plans for metro lines were cancelled, with the focus altered to expansion of the present heavy rail system. The rail-related portions consisted of:
In August 2010, the Australian Labor Party announced funding for the Epping-Parramatta rail line (as an extension of the Carlingford Line) as part of its re-election bid for the 2010 federal election, despite it not appearing in the State Government's Transport Plan. In March 2011, the State Election resulted in Barry O'Farrell elected as premier of NSW who has committed to constructing the North West rail line and the light rail extension. The Western Express and CBD Relief Line were cancelled by the new government. As of 2013, the Epping-Parramatta rail line has been shelved by the NSW Government.
NSW Transport Masterplan, 2012.
In June 2012 the government released the "Sydney's Rail Future: Modernising Sydney's Trains" plan. The plan warned that if there was not a second Harbour Crossing and CBD line by 2031 there would be moderate to severe overcrowding on lines approaching the CBD, with passenger displacement predicted for the Northern Line and East Hills/Illawarra Line. The plan also predicted further congestion the three major CBD station: Central, Town Hall & Wynyard.
In December 2012, a new transport masterplan for Sydney and New South Wales was announced by Barry O'Farrell after community feedback and discussion.

En-rogel

En-rogel (Hebrew: ‛êyn rôgêl עין רגל) was a famous land-mark near Jerusalem. It was the hiding-place of David's spies, Jonathan and Ahimaaz (2 Sam. 17:17), and lay close to the stone Zoheleth where Adonijah held a sacrificial feast when he attempted to assert his claims to the throne (1 Kings 1:9). In later times it was one of the boundary marks between Judah and Benjamin (Josh. 15:7, 18:16). The obviously sacred character of the spring suggests that it is the same as the Dragon Well of Neh. 2:13.
There can be little doubt of its antiquity, and it may well have been a sacred place in pre-Israelite times. The meaning of the name and its identification are uncertain.
The interpretation 'Fuller’s Well' does not bear the mark of antiquity. It is probable that, like Zoheleth, the original name had some sacred or mythic significance.
Two identifications of the place have met with considerable favour:
Against the latter it is urged that Bir-Eyyub is a well, not a spring, that it lies too far from ez-Zehweleh, although it lies near a large stone in Siloam village called Zehwillat, that it is in full view of the city, and does not suit the context of 2Sam. 17:17, and that its antiquity is uncertain. The chief points in favour of (1) (which Baed. identifies with Gihon spring) are: its antiquity and the evidence of Josephus. (Anti. vii. 14 4), who places the well in the royal gardens. Other arguments based upon the fact that in later times the well was used by fullers are necessarily precarious.

Haitian Heritage Month

Haitian Heritage Month is a celebration in the United States of Haitian heritage and culture. It was first celebrated in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1998. Tele Kreyol, one of the Boston Haitian Access Television programs, celebrated the whole month of May with a series of programs on Haitian history, culture, and contributions to the world. The month-long celebration has continued with such activities as parades, flag raisings, and exhibits organized by Haitian-Americans United, Inc. (H.A.U.) in collaboration with several Haitian organizations in the New England area.
The Haitian community of Palm Beach County, Florida, which started the Heritage celebration in 2001, contributed greatly to make the Heritage Month first a statewide celebration, and then, a national one in the United States. South Florida congressman Kendrick B. Meek introduced unsuccessfully a bill in the United States House of Representatives in 2004 and 2006 to recognize the month of May as Haitian-American Heritage Month in the United States. President George W. Bush and his wife Laura Bush sent a letter in May 2005 to congratulate the Haitian-American community for the heritage month and organized a celebration at the White House the same year.
Since 1998, several governors, members of state senates and houses of representatives, mayors and city councilors have issued annual citations and proclamations, recognizing the Haitian Heritage Month celebration in their states or cities.
In 2008, the Haitian Heritage Month/Flag Day was celebrated with parades, festivals, schools activities, and flag raising ceremonies in the following cities and counties in the U.S.:
The Haitian Heritage Month celebration is an expansion of the Haitian Flag Day, a major patriotic day celebration in Haiti and the Diaspora. Haitian President Dumarsais Estimé started the Flag Day celebration with parades, cultural and athletic events in many cities in Haiti in the 1930s, when he was minister of education under President Sténio Vincent. Estime wanted to commemorate annually the creation of the Haitian flag on May 18 to encourage the development of patriotic sentiments among Haitian youth.
Beside the Flag Day celebration, the month of May carries a number of significant historical and cultural traditions that Haitians are proud to make aware of and to pass on to future generations. In Haiti, May 1 is celebrated as Labor and Agriculture Day. May 2 used to be Flower Day. The Congress of Arcahaie that united black and mulatto officers to fight together for Haiti's independence is remembered from May 15 through 18. The Haitian slave and revolutionary general, Toussaint Louverture, was born on May 20, 1743. Teacher's Day is May 17, University Day May 18, and Mother's Day is celebrated on the last Sunday of May. For Haitian Catholics, May is the month of Mary, the mother of Jesus.

Santa Mesa station is a station on the South Main Line (Southrail) of the Philippine National Railways. Like all PNR stations, the station is at grade. It is located on an unnamed road near Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard in Santa Mesa, Manila, making it one of two stations (the other is Pasay Road) to have its own access road. The station is named after the district where it is located.
The station is the fourth station southbound from Tutuban and is the only Southrail station serving Santa Mesa. 
In addition to having its own dedicated access road, Santa Mesa station is also one of three stations (the others being Pasay Road and España) to have its original platforms extended and raised in order to accommodate new PNR diesel multiple units. The original platforms have been retained for the use of Commuter Express locomotives and especially for intercity trains, although Santa Mesa is not designated as a station where these trains can stop. Previously, the station served as the terminus for the Santa Mesa-Mandaluyong branch line, although this line has since been dismantled.
Nearby landmarks.
The station is near landmarks such as the Santa Mesa Public Market, SM City Sta. Mesa, the main campus of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP), the Eulogio "Amang" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST), the Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School and the Philippine headquarters of the Tzu Chi Foundation.

<doc id="19967008" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19967008" title="Dynamic combustion chamber">
Dynamic combustion chamber

The Dynamic Combustion Chamber is an engine that allows for the combustion of gases in a vacuum or under pressure, eliminating the production of air pollutants. Combined with a clean renewable source of electricity, the Dynamic Combustion Chamber would serve as a battery to store and discharge electricity when needed. This would fill in the gaps that sources of electricity such as wind and solar have during different time periods, and replace peaker plants or fossil fuel based power plants which supply electricity to the grid when there is a shortage. 
How It Works.
Hydrogen and Oxygen gas are fed into a vacuum inside a chamber. The hydrogen is combusted with oxygen
to form water and heat. A heat exchanger is inside the chamber to remove the heat from the chamber.
The heat exchanger has water inside which is boiled to make steam. The steam can be used to create
electricity through a turbine and generator, or it can be used as a source of heat. The water created in the chamber can be recycled for creating steam or for electrolysis.
Prototypes.
SOG R&D Corporation, the company which holds the patents on the Dynamic Combustion Chamber, has contracted the Hydrogen Production and Utilization Laboratory at University of California, Davis to perform the testing. A lab bench scale model was built and verified that it produced steam and also that there were no pollutants formed during the process. 
Advantages and Disadvantages.
Typically combustion based engines use the air as their source of oxygen. The problem with using
air is that it contains other gases than oxygen. Gases such as nitrogen react with oxygen at high
temperatures to form pollutants. By moving the combustion reaction inside a vacuum and using pure
oxygen, there are no pollutants formed during the reaction. 
Requiring pure oxygen limits the portability and usability of the Dynamic Combustion Chamber. A vehicle would need to carry a tank of hydrogen and oxygen. Competing technologies such as Fuel Cells can use hydrogen and air, however using air instead of pure oxygen makes fuel cells less efficient. Considering the need for pure oxygen as well as hydrogen, hydrolysis or
splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, seems to be the most practical source of reactants. 
To generate electricity a turbine with a generator is necessary. A fuel cell can generate electricity directly, removing extra moving parts. Since fuel cells do not have any moving parts they do not lose energy to friction. Fuel cells generate heat as well as electricity which reduces their efficiency.
Potential Uses.
Just like other engines the Dynamic Combustion Chamber needs a source of fuel. There has been some controversy about whether hydrogen technology actually reduces pollution or just moves it to a more central source such as a power plant. By using clean renewable sources such as wind or solar, hydrogen can be produced without any pollution. This hydrogen can be transported or consumed later when needed. This adds to the portability and usability of an electricity source. Commonly in the electrical grid there are base load power plants and peaker plants.Using hydrogen as an energy storage medium would reduce emissions as peaker plants are particularly inefficient.

Muroami

The muro-ami fishing technique, employed on coral reefs in Southeast Asia, uses an encircling net together with pounding devices. These devices usually comprise large stones fitted on ropes that are pounded into the coral reefs. They can also consist of large heavy blocks of cement that are suspended above the sea by a crane fitted to the vessel. The pounding devices are repeatedly and violently lowered into the area encircled by the net, literally smashing the coral in that area into small fragments in order to scare the fish out of their coral refuges. The "crushing" effect of the pounding process on the coral heads has been described as having longlasting and practically totally destructive effects.

JRDF (framework)

JRDF is an open source RDF framework for Java. It provides an object oriented model of RDF graphs including URIs, Literals and Blank Nodes. It was initially released in 2003 from work on the TKS and Kowari triple stores (later Mulgara) in order to provide an API that could be used to bridge other APIs such as Jena and to model RDF concepts. These APIs allow RDF to be created and written using various formats such as N3 and RDF/XML. It has an implementation of SPARQL although it is not complete. RDF graphs can be stored in memory or on disk through various persistence layers. In 2008, JRDF implemented a triple store across Hadoop using a technique called RDF molecules.
JRDF is similar to other frameworks such as Jena and Sesame although it does not currently provide support for OWL (Web Ontology Language).

Sile Doty

Sile Doty (August 30, 1800 – March 12, 1876) was an infamous robber, burglar, horse thief, highwayman, counterfeiter, and criminal gang leader. Stewart Holbrook says that Doty "was, before the James-Younger era, the most energetic and notorious all-around bandit in the United States." Doty's criminal career is known primarily through his autobiography, compiled by J. G. W. Colburn and published four years after Doty's death as "The Life of Sile Doty The Most Noted Thief and Daring Burglar of His Time." As this title suggests, the tone of the autobiography is boastful and unapologetic. Doty excuses his crimes as stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Except where otherwise noted, what follows is taken from the autobiography and may contain exaggerations and self-serving distortions.
Early life.
He was born Silas Doty in St. Albans, Vermont. As a child, he stole toys from his siblings, a pen knife from his teacher, and a horseshoe from a blacksmith, not because he needed or wanted these things, but for the excitement and pleasure he took from evading detection. When Doty was about nine years old, his family moved west to Bangor, New York, a fur trapping region, where he began a lucrative three-year career of stealing animals from traps and selling their furs. About 1815, Doty joined a band of thieves and counterfeiters operating in the Bangor area. In a few years, Doty became the leader of this gang, whose depredations now extended throughout New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.
In the winter of 1818, Doty learned blacksmithing and used his new skills to outfit himself with a complete set of skeleton keys and burglary tools. Throughout his criminal career Doty specialized in making such tools and employing them with great stealth and skill. Doty typically employed disguises, false identities, misdirection, and other nonviolent means, but when directly challenged he would resort to brass knuckles or whatever was at hand. Doty learned to pass counterfeit money from Ed Cooper, a resident of New York City, who would wholesale such money to him for 30 cents on the dollar.
Criminal methods and tactics.
Doty typically entered a town with one or more associates, who would pretend not to know Doty in order to gather intelligence about whether he had been detected—and if so, what actions were being taken to pursue him. If he had counterfeit money, Doty would go on a spending spree, all the while scouting out where stores kept their money. If a tempting prize was guarded by a watch dog, Doty would feed it poisoned meat. At night he and his associates would break into homes, places of business, and stables using skeleton keys and relocking doors after leaving. He would deposit his loot with a confederate. By the time Doty was ready to leave town, he would have scouted out a fast horse to steal, in order to make his getaway. A favorite tactic was to have an associate show up at the location of the horse to be stolen with a legitimately rented horse. Doty would steal both the horse and a sulky, wagon, or other rig, which would be attached to the legitimate horse and driven by the associate in the opposite direction from that taken by Doty and the stolen horse. Several miles out of town, the stolen rig would be abandoned and the legitimate horse returned to its owner. It never failed that when the theft was detected, the aroused citizens would pursue the tracks of the stolen rig.
Each year, Doty would go on a campaign of crime through the towns and cities of New York State and New England. He was part of an extensive network of criminals with whom he cooperated and to whom he could sell his stolen goods. During the summer of 1822, Doty learned sailing by working on a boat traveling up and down the Saint Lawrence River, and in the process managed to fill a trunk with pilfered valuables. In the fall, Doty made use of his new sailing skills by stealing a pleasure boat in Kingston, Ontario, loading it with stolen property, and sailing it down the Saint Lawrence to a place near Ogdensburg, New York, where he unloaded the boat and sank it.
England.
In the spring of 1823, finding himself hotly pursued by his victims from throughout the northeastern United States, Doty decided to ship out for Quebec City, from which he took passage first to Halifax, thence to Liverpool, England. Doty soon found a thriving underworld in Liverpool, from which he selected four rogues for his English gang. After engaging in some thievery in Liverpool, the gang took a ship to the north of England near the Scottish border where they stole nine horses. After a five-day ride, the gang reached London, where they sold the stolen horses. Doty spent the winter of 1823-1824 committing burglaries in London. In the spring, he was forced to flee London on foot, one step ahead of the law. Having walked all the way to Liverpool, he booked passage to New York City under an alias.
Midwest.
Doty spent the winter of 1824-1825 at his father's home in Bangor, New York, perfecting his metalworking skills and courting Sophia Adams, whom he married in the spring of 1825. Doty tried to lead a settled life of farming, but he could never resist the temptation to go on another campaign of thievery. Finally by 1834, Doty was wanted for crimes throughout the northeast and his evil reputation had followed him home to Bangor, so he moved with his wife to Adrian, Michigan, and shifted his criminal operations to Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois. In 1838, Doty extended one of his campaigns into Kentucky, where he helped a slave to escape and cross the Ohio River to the free state of Ohio. Doty was motivated less by abolitionist sentiment than by the challenge of stealing a slave.
In 1839, Doty moved to Steuben County, Indiana where he hired Lorenzo G. Noyes to work for him as a farm hand. When Noyes learned of Doty's criminal activities he threatened to go to the authorities, whereupon Doty struck him with a hickory walking stick, killing him. Doty hid the body in a swamp. In 1841, Doty was arrested for stealing a span of matched bays and confined to the jail in Huntersville, Virginia, now in West Virginia, but an accomplice smuggled him a saw and auger, which he used to saw through the log structure and make his escape. He made his way to the notorious Tamarack House near Rome, Indiana, the hangout of outlaws from throughout the Midwest. Sile Doty, most likely, knew of and had connections with the Banditti of the Prairie in Illinois. The following winter Doty was arrested in Michigan for stealing a large number of buffalo robes and several sets of harness and sent to the penitentiary for two years. In June 1842, a body said to be that of Lorenzo Noyes was discovered, and as a result Doty was removed to the jail in Angola, Indiana to stand trial for Noyes' murder. In 1844, Doty was convicted of murder in the second degree and sentenced to life in prison.
Mexico.
In the fall of 1845, the Supreme Court of Indiana granted Doty a new trial, and he was returned to the Angola jail to await the retrial. In the spring of 1846, he escaped by cutting a hole through the jail floor and got as far as Logansport, Indiana before being identified and returned to jail. Using two knives hidden in his belt, Doty broke out of jail once more and headed for the Mexican-American War, reaching General Zachary Taylor's army at Camargo about September first. Congress had passed a law forgiving all past offenses of those who enlisted for the duration of the war, so Doty sent letters to his home saying that he had enlisted until the end of the war, although he had done no such thing.
After Monterrey fell to the Americans Doty joined other scoundrels in a binge of looting and murder. About December 1846, Doty stole the best horse he could find in General Taylor's camp at Monterrey and rode it to General Winfield Scott's camp at Camargo, where he won General Scott's good will by presenting him with the stolen horse. Scott employed Doty to take care of the horse and used him as a messenger during the Battle of Veracruz. Doty followed the American army all the way to Mexico City, disguising himself as a Mexican at night in order to waylay and rob Mexican citizens, selling the plundered goods to soldiers in the American army.
Home, prison and old age.
In the fall of 1847, Doty returned to his home in Steuben County, Indiana and continued his depredations on the citizens of northern Indiana and southern Michigan, having convinced his neighbors that he had been granted amnesty because of his participation in the Mexican-American War. In August 1849, Doty was arrested for robbing a peddler, and spent several months in jail in Hillsdale, Michigan before being bailed out. Doty was able to get his trial postponed repeatedly, during which time he stepped up his criminal activity stealing more property, he claimed, than at any other time in his career. When he finally came to trial in the spring of 1851, Doty was found guilty and sentenced to 17 years in the State Prison of Southern Michigan. Even though Doty could not resist stealing small items like horseshoes, he was trusted by his jailors to work alone outdoors at various farm chores, and he was released two years early for good behavior on September 1, 1866. The following summer, Doty stole a horse from a lawyer who, he thought, had wronged him years before. He was apprehended at a livery near the old Yates House hotel in Bryan, Ohio, and returned to prison for four years. Upon release, Doty immediately returned to his life of crime, and was again convicted of theft and returned to prison for another two years. Despite being in his seventies by the time he completed this sentence, Doty continued his criminal career until his death at the home of his son in Reading, Michigan.
Sile Doty appears as a character, played by Robert Wilke, in the 1956 film "Raw Edge".

Ziegenbock

Ziegenbock (Ziegen Bock) is an amber ale brewed by Anheuser-Busch. It is billed as "for Texans by Texans."
Ziegenbock is an imitation craft brew marketed under Anheuser-Busch's ICS (Import - Craft - Specialty) brand, positioned as a Texan beer to compete with Shiner Bock. Ziegenbock is brewed at Anheuser-Busch's Houston brewery and is very similar to Michelob Amber Bock, but it is sold exclusively in the Texas market. Like Shiner Bock and Amber Bock, it does not conform to the BJCP style guidelines for a Bock, either in terms of flavor profile or potency. A Traditional Bock typically has an ABV range of 6.3 - 7.2%, where Ziegenbock is 4% (Shiner Bock is 4.4%; Amber Bock slightly truer in this respect at 5.2%.) Also lacking is the complex richness of Munich and Vienna malts. Shiner Bock comes somewhat closer to the flavor profile of a Bock.
Ziegfest.
Ziegfest is an annual music festival sponsored by Ziegenbock and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch. Ziegfest typically features "red-dirt" musicians. There are typically several venues with the events scheduled around a month apart.
Concept and Development.
Ziegenbock was developed in the 1990s after a team of Southern Methodist University students identified that "Specialty" beers were becoming more of a plausible purchase rather than the mainstream flavors produced. A part of the team, Clarke Russell, conducted focus groups amongst brew house patrons as well as students at multiple universities to determine the demand of a Specialty beer such as Ziegenbock. The intent was not only to design a beer capable of supplying beer aficionados, but people interested in the flavor of specialty beers rather than mainstream breweries. As a result Ziegenbock was developed as the definitive specialty beer to compete with specialty beers such as Shiner Bock, Samual Adams, Sweetwater as well as other more regional ales presented across ths U.S.

<doc id="19967284" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19967284" title="Alcohol laws of Maryland">
Alcohol laws of Maryland

Alcohol laws of Maryland are unique in that they vary considerably by county, due to the wide latitude of home rule granted to Maryland counties.
State laws.
Underage possession and consumption.
It is illegal under state law for a person under the age of 21 to possess or consume an alcoholic beverage, but the law contains several exceptions:
It is also a separate offense for an underage person to misrepresent their age for purposes of obtaining alcohol, and to merely possess any sort of card or document that falsely identifies the person's age. An underage person who illegally possesses alcohol or false identification is subject to a citation rather than arrest, and the event is considered a civil offense, meaning that it does not count as a criminal conviction and cannot result in imprisonment in and of itself. This is because the reason for the drinking age in the first place is that the law does not consider individuals under 21 to be responsible enough to consume alcohol unsupervised, and therefore holding them fully criminally responsible would be paradoxical.
Furnishing alcohol to underage persons.
Except for the exceptions provided in the previous section, Maryland's law also makes it illegal for anyone to purchase alcohol for someone under 21, or to give it to them. Both these laws require that the defendant knew the person was under 21, and that they purchased or furnished it for the purpose of that underage person consuming it. In addition, it is also illegal for an adult who owns or leases property, and lives at that property, to knowingly and willfully allow anyone under 21 to consume alcohol there, unless they are members of the same immediate family. This law does not necessarily make homeowners criminally responsible for any illegal drinking at their residence, unless they were both aware of it and intentionally allowed it to happen.
Taxation.
In July 2011, Maryland's taxation of alcohol was increased for the first time since the 1970s, from 6 percent to 9 percent. This taxation is applied at the consumer level, appearing as a line-item on the customer's receipt.
County laws.
Note: Four Montgomery County grocery chains — Giant Food, Safeway, Shoppers Food & Pharmacy, and Magruder's — received an exception from the state law that bans grocery stores from selling beer and wine under a grandfather clause. These four are allowed to have one location that sells beer and wine in Montgomery County: Giant’s New Hampshire Avenue store in Silver Spring, Safeway in Olney, Shoppers in Germantown, and Magruder's in Gaithersburg. These licenses can be transferred to any of the chain’s other locations in Montgomery County subject to approval by the county Board of License Commissioners.

Ulocladium is a genus of fungi. Species of this genus contain both plant pathogens and food spoilage agents. Other species contain enzymes that are biological control agents. 
Some members of the genus can invade homes and are a sign of moisture because the mold requires water to thrive. They can cause plant diseases or hay fever and more serious infections in immuno-suppressed individuals. 
Species of "Ulocladium" resemble those of genus "Alternaria" with which they were once included. But "Ulocladium", unlike "Alternaria", do not produce alternariols, tenuazonic acid, altersolanols, or macrosporin.

Development Assistance Accountability Act

The Official Development Assistance Accountability Act, Bill C-293, is a piece of Canadian federal legislation that governs how development aid given to foreign countries is delivered and administered. The bill was introduced as a Private Member's Bill by Liberal MP John McKay which called for significant changes to the manner in which Canada’s official development assistance is delivered and administered. 
Often referred to as the ‘Better Aid Bill,’ its primary purpose is to mandate that the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) target Canada’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the specific goal of poverty reduction in developing nations. 
Prior to the passage of C-293, parliamentary committees and NGOs had called for a clearer mandate for ODA. Critics of Canada’s aid spending noted that assistance was often sent to countries that had recently experienced strong economic growth and prosperity or had dubious records regarding human rights. In an article from June 19, 2007, National Post columnist John Ivison reported that Canada had sent $7.7 million to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for job creation programs and reconciliation projects, despite the country’s healthy economy, lower taxation rate and higher per capita GDP. In another example, Ivison noted that in 2004-2005 China received $57 million in ODA, amid concerns held by the international community about human rights abuses.
The Bill established a set of principles that CIDA must take into account when judging how aid is to be spent. First, it requires that the perspectives and concerns of those who receive ODA be taken into account. This means that Canadian aid flows will have to respect the priorities of its beneficiaries - the people living in poverty. Secondly, it requires that ODA be promulgated in a manner consistent with Canadian values and foreign policy, sustainable development, and the promotion of democracy and human rights. The Bill also requires that Canadian foreign aid spending be more transparent and accountable to Parliament and must be reported in a timely manner. 
Due to the legislated focus on long-term poverty reduction, ODA cannot be redirected towards international military efforts or short-term disaster relief (areas of policy that the Canadian government must fund separately) and is subject to judicial review and oversight by the Minister. 
The Honourable Romeo Dallaire moved third reading of C-293 in the Senate. Senator Dallaire hailed the Bill saying: “My colleague in the other place, the Honourable John McKay, introduced Bill C-293 in the House of Commons in May 2006, almost two years ago. It has come a long way since then and has been put through many valuable and essential debates. I believe the debates initiated by Bill C-293 were so important that they will inform the nature of any future essential international development policy and legislation in this country. It is a first step.”
On March 20, 2008 C-293 passed third reading in the House of Commons with unanimous support from all parties. It received Royal Assent on May 29, 2008, thus becoming law as the Development Assistance Accountability Act, (An Act respecting the provision of official development assistance abroad).
Canada’s Official Development Assistance Accountability Act represents a trend among other nations that provide foreign aid toward legislated mandates for the provision of foreign aid. In 2002 the U.K. passed the International Development Act that entrenched poverty reduction as the preponderant focus of its foreign aid. Other countries with similar legislation include Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Luxembourg, Denmark and Belgium.
C-293 has received praise from a diverse array of groups and organizations including Canada's Coalition to End Global Poverty, 
Make Poverty History, Engineers without Borders and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada.

Joseph Matthais Gérard de Rayneval (1736–1812) served as under-secretary of state to Comte de Vergennes.
In 1776, he produced a memo of the strategic situation, "Reflections on the Situation in America".
In 1782, he was sent on several secret missions to England, to make peace feelers.
John Jay, learning of the trip, suspected French duplicity, leading him to begin separate negotiations with the British.
He negotiated with Jay about Missippippi: If by the future treaty of peace, Spain preserves West Florida, she alone will be the sole proprietor of the course of the Mississippi from the thirty-first degree of latitude to the mouth of this river. Whatever may be the case with that part which is beyond this point to the north, the United States of America can have no pretentions to it, not being masters of either border to this river.
On 30 November, preliminary articles of peace are signed. But it took a year, until 3 September 1783 for the Paris Peace Treaty to be signed.

Sheridan Flouring Mills, Inc.

The Sheridan Flouring Mills, also known as the Mill Inn, are an industrial complex in Sheridan, Wyoming. The mills were a major component of the economy of north central Wyoming, providing collection, storage and milling of locally-produced wheat and other grains into flour and other milled products. The original mill was established by Captain Scott W. Snively in the early 1890s. The Sheridan Milling and Manufacturing Company was sold to J.W. Denio in 1903, who operated the mill at its location on Broadway Avenue near downtown Sheridan. A catastrophic fire destroyed this mill in 1919, resulting in the purchase of a new location on Coffeen Avenue and construction of a much larger mill.
The present complex was built in 1920-21 for J.W. Denio by Ballinger and McAllister of Bloomington, Illinois. It consists of a reinforced concrete mill building with a long two-story wing and a more compact six-story section, adjoined by a reinforced concrete grain elevator with seven pairs of grain tanks. The elevator features a large logo with a cowboy on a bucking horse and the legend "Best Out West Enriched Flour, Tomahawk Feeds For Livestock and Poultry, Sheridan Flouring Mills, Inc." The elevator building is high, while the grain tanks are high. The mill therefore dominates the skyline of Sheridan.
The mill was purchased by Nebraska Consolidated Mills Company in 1963, the firm that became Con-Agra in 1971. The mill was upgraded in 1967, but closed in 1972. In 1974 a local corporation purchased the mill and converted it into a hotel in 1977-1978. As part of the hotel renovation, the interior partitions were removed from the mill building and new windows were installed, partially closing the openings with masonry. 
The grain elevators had a capacity in the 1930s of 410,000 bushels of grain. They are now abandoned and their machinery has been removed. The mill's products included wheat cereal and biscuit, doughnut, waffle and pancake flour, marketed as "Best Out West." Animal feed products were sold under the "Tomahawk" brand. The mill employed a baker to test the production by baking bread twice a day.
The mill had a rail connection via a spur line of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The tracks were removed with the development of the Sugarland commercial district.

Turf Battles

Turf Battles, often referred to as TB, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). It is IMAZIC's first released game first introduced in 2002. "Turf Battles" takes place within the world of Fomalhaut, years after a major war. Originally published under HyperEngines LLC, but the operation team was actually based in Bangalore, India, a company known as TurfbattleGames Pvt Ltd which in turn was a subsidiary of QIXO.com an airfare search engine company. Mr.Daniel Ko, CEO of Qixo announced the open beta of TB on around September 2005, forming a subsidiary company exclusively for game operations. Due to many technical issues the game ultimately failed and TurfbattleGames closed its operations on mid-2008. 
However, due to popular player support, the title was picked up for the American audience by Aeria Games and Entertainment. Aeria Games and Entertainment announced "Turf Battles" on December 9, 2008. After three Closed Betas, Turf Battles has gone into a final Beta Stress Test which moved into an Open Beta. On June 18, 2010 Aeria Games closed down the Turf Battles servers citing "over a year of continued issues (old and new). (Aeria Games) have been working with the developer through these difficulties, but the efforts of both teams have not been able to completely eradicate the problems facing Turf Battles. Fewer and fewer people have been logging in." 
In 2012, an independent development team "Hyper Envision" purchased the rights to Sephiroth. They have named the project Turf Battles: A New Beginning and are currently in Alpha Testing, however this is reserved for the development team for now. The server's will hopefully be up and running for the public late 2012, early 2013, it will mark the revival of Turf Battles English. They will be developing based on the original HyperEngine LLC system, including the Island PK system.
Turf Battles is now undergoing closed beta and is ready to play

Gameplay.
Starting a character or a play session.
As with other MMORPGs, players control a character avatar within a game world, exploring the landscape, fighting monsters, completing quests and interacting with NPCs or other players. In common with many other MMORPGs, "Turf Battles" does not require the player to pay for a subscription, but in-game items can be purchased with real-world money.
To enter the game, the player must select a realm (or server). Each realm acts as an individual copy of the game world. Servers are both Player versus player (PvP) where open combat among players is common and Player versus environment (PvE) where the focus is on defeating monsters and completing quests. On a server a player may create characters belonging to either race, either Human or Nephilim. Each server has several channels which players can change between freely during gameplay and either select one of their previously made characters or create a new one.
To create a new character, players must choose between the two races of Humans or Nephilim. Characters from the two races can communicate and trade, and members of the two races can speak, email, group, and share tribes. The player selects the new character's class, such as Archers or Blue Mages for the Nephilim or Blades, Fists or Red Mages for the Humans. The classes are limited to the particular races.
On-going gameplay.
As characters become more developed, they gain skills, requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character. Crafting materials such as leather, herbs, metal, wood, and gems can also used by characters. Characters may also form or join tribes, allowing characters in the same tribes unified communications, a shared tribe name, and possibly identity, tribe bank and dues.
Much "Turf Battles" play involves questing. These quests, also called tasks or missions, are usually available from non-player characters (NPCs). Quests usually reward the player with experience points, items, and/or in-game money. It is also through quests that much of the game's story is told, both through the quest text and through scripted NPC actions. Quests are linked by a common theme, with the next quest triggered by the completion of the previous, forming a quest chain. Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, speaking to various NPCs, visiting specific locations, interacting with objects in the world, or delivering an item from one place to another.
While a character can be played on its own, players can also group up with others in order to tackle more challenging content. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group. In "Turf Battles" when a character dies, they are resurrected in the nearest Safe Zone and when a character dies to a monster, they lose some experience and there is a possibility of dropping items you had equipped, requiring the player to attempt to return to that location to regain that piece. When a character fights the items equipped degrade, requiring in-game money and a NPC to repair them. Items that degrade heavily can become unusable until they are repaired.
"Turf Battles" contains a variety of mechanisms for Player versus player (PvP) combat. Each server allows player versus player combat almost anywhere in the game world. In these environments, players can attack each other at almost any time or location. On all servers there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted. Battle arenas, for example, allow all players to engage each other without fear of penalty or loss of rank.
Setting.
"Turf Battles" is a Massively Multi-Player Online Role Playing Game. It takes place in a 3D-representation of the world of Fomalhaut that players can interact with through their characters. The game features two main lands on the continent of Fomalhaut and numerous smaller lands and islands. In this game world, players use their characters to explore locations, defeat creatures and complete quests, among other such activities. By doing this, characters gain experience points. After a set amount of experience points have been gained, a character gains a level and new stat points, opening up the option of learning new skills and using new items, exploring new areas and attempting new quests. As a player explores new locations they can
"save" locations for future reference, and in order to teleport back to these locations should the desire arise. Players can discover "crystal shifters" in newly discovered locations and then use those NPCs in order to teleport to previously discovered locations in other parts of the world. Players can also use facilities such as NPCs, or "crystals" in order to move from one area of Fomalhaut to another. Although the game world remains reasonably similar from day to day, locations have changeable weather such as dust, snow and storms.
A number of facilities are available to characters when in towns and cities. In each major city characters can access a warehouse in order to deposit items, such as treasure or crafted items. Each warehouse is unique to that character, with players able to purchase additional storage space. In the major cities of Fomalhaut, players can expect to see player hosted booths. These are effective for selling items you have gained, or while you wish to remain connected to the game should you decide to go away from your keyboard.
Some of the harder challenges in "Turf Battles" require players to group together to complete them. These usually take place in dungeons and other difficult areas that a group of characters can enter together. This allows players to explore areas and complete quests with other players outside the group. Each major area has one main dungeon and are designed for characters of varying progressions.
Development.
"Turf Battles" was first announced by HyperEngines LLC in October 2005. Development of the game from the Korean version has taken about 2 months with extensive testing. The game was designed to be an open environment where players are allowed to do what they please. Quests are optional and were designed to help guide players, allow character development, and to spread characters across different zones to try to avoid what developers call 'player collision'. The game interface allows players to customize appearance and controls and other modifications.
"Turf Battles" runs natively on Windows platforms. If you are using Windows Vista: While running "Turf Battles", for best results, choose the option: "Run as Administrator".
Regional variations.
IMAZIC distributes "Turf Battles" in the following countries: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, and the United States.
In Korea, the game is called "Sephiroth" (세피로스). Sephiroth is the base version of Turf Battles. Written in Korean, and allowing those with only Korean Social Security Numbers to play.
In Taiwan, the game is called "Sephiroth" (凱旋). The game is written in the Chinese language, and is restricted solely to players that are located in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.
In China, the game is called "Kaixuan" (凯旋/Triumph). The game is written in the Chinese language, and is restricted solely to players that are located in Asia.
In Japan, the game is known as "Sephiroth" (セフィロス). Written in Japanese, the client download is currently only available to those who live in Japan.
Usage problems.
"Turf Battles" may have issues when using dual and Quad core CPUs. Computers with AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor CPUs and Intel Core 2 CPUs may experiences some problems with "Turf Battles".
Windows Vista users may have issues installing and running "Turf Battles". This issue can be resolved by choosing the "Run as Administrator" option, when installing the game or launching the client. Another option is to disable the User Account Control located in the control panel. Disabling this option requires you to restart your computer in order for the changes to take effect.
Security concerns.
Among many MMORPGs, "Turf Battles" does not have a protected user authentication system. It is the players responsibility to choose a strong and secure password, and to avoid downloading third party software as these can often contain keyloggers. These are trojans which record your keystrokes and sometimes mouse clicks, and display them for another user to see, and to steal your log in information. While this type of authentication may be vulnerable, it is not unique to "Turf Battles" and other MMORPGs may also choose to use this type of protection.
Community.
Aside from playing the game and conversing in discussion topics, "Turf Battles" players often participate in the virtual community in creative ways. This includes, but is not limited to: fan artwork.

Elen Dosia

Elen Dosia (1915 - May 15, 2002), born Hélène Odette Zygomala, sometimes known as Ellen Dosia, was a French opera singer of Greek origin.
Dosia was born in Constantinople. She became a soprano singer, and enjoyed her first major success at age 20 with the title part in "Tosca". She quickly became one of the most popular singers at Opéra Garnier and Opéra-Comique, where she performed from 1935 through 1952. Before World War II she was described as "the most popular singer in the world". She appeared often in Massenet operas, performing in "Manon" and "Thaïs", and appearing at the June 1942 Massenet Gala singing the title role in a tableaux of "Esclarmonde".
In 1951 she appeared in "Of Men and Music", a Fox film production, singing excerpts from Salome's part in "Hérodiade".
On November 15, 1947 Dosia debuted at the Metropolitan Opera as Tosca to Jan Peerce's Cavaradossi and Frank Valentino's Scarpia with Giuseppe Antonicelli conducting. Her performance was relatively poorly received; reviews were critical, and after only five performances (in both "Tosca" and "Manon", and as Mélisande in "Pelléas et Mélisande" the following season), she retired from the stage in 1952. Thereafter Dosia concentrated on her family life.

At Otago he became interested in metamorphism and studied the unexplored metamorphic rocks of South Island on which he earned his PhD in 1934 from the University of New Zealand. His application and expansion of Pentti Eskola's concept of metamorphic facies led to his publication of "Mineralogical and Structural Evolution of Metamorphic Rocks", the book that established his position in the field of petrology and was a great influence on a generation of geologists.
In 1946 he accepted a position at the University of California in Berkeley. At Berkeley he gained insight into experimental studies of petrology and geochemistry. He later collaborated with John Verhoogen on the classic work "Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology" published in 1960. He authored eighty technical papers and six textbooks on metamorphic, igneous, and structural petrology. He retired from Berkeley in 1971.

Dear Lemon Lima

Dear Lemon Lima is a 2009 family comedy feature film written and directed by Suzi Yoonessi. Based on her short film of the same name and developed with the support of Film Independent and its Filmmaker Labs, this film is about a 13-year-old half-Yup’ik girl navigating her way through first heartbreak and the perils of prep school in Fairbanks, Alaska. In learning the meanings of love, friendship, and community, Vanessa Lemor finds her voice by embracing her heritage and reclaiming the spirit of the World Eskimo Indian Olympics (WEIO) at a private school where her narcissistic sweetheart’s family is legendary.
Plot.
Vanessa Lemor, a lonely 13-year old Yup’ik (Western Eskimo) girl with a vivid imagination, is dumped by her true love, über intellectual Philip Georgey, 14. Vanessa spends the summer in Fairbanks, Alaska, working at an ice cream shack and obsessing over the heartbreaking tragedy. After numerous unsuccessful attempts at erasing fond memories, she resolves to win Philip back at Nichols Academy (named after Yoonessi's alma mater, Nichols School), a close-minded preparatory school where the Georgey family is legendary. 
Awarded the only minority scholarship, Vanessa’s new life is a nightmare. Back from the summer abroad and fluent in French, Philip is elevated to popular status, while Vanessa is relegated to the bottom of the prep school caste system with the rest of the FUBARs. Rounding out the rest of the FUBARs are Hercules, a loveable, but socially inept boy with wildly overprotective parents, Samantha, a 14-year old who claims her father is a rapper, and Nothing (formally known as Madeline), whose family owns a funeral parlor. Vanessa’s consolation prize is Philip’s decision to honor Vanessa by being her student advisor. Philip, wishing the best for his pupil, reinstates the values that once brought them together – the pursuit of individuality and embracement of a social consciousness: an alternative lifestyle for a better world. Unfortunately, Vanessa misinterprets his preaching, and alienates herself by presenting an anarchist essay at the opening school ceremony. To make matters worse, she is the only freshman captain selected for the school’s infamous Snowstorm Survivor competition, an event inspired by the Native events in the World Eskimo Indian Olympics. 
Vanessa believes that a victory in the Snowstorm Survivor championship is the only way into Philip’s heart. She quickly forms a quirky team with her fan base in the weight room. Team FUBAR prepares for the event, driven by Vanessa’s plight for her true love. Unlike the Native Olympics that brings together people of all sizes and shapes to celebrate Native Alaskan culture, Nichols’ Snowstorm Survivor simply perverts the traditional Eskimo games in order to foster an antiquated class system.
After the tragic loss of a beloved teammate, Vanessa discovers the true meaning of love and must embrace her Native heritage to reclaim the spirit of the World Eskimo Indian Olympics.
Release.
"Dear Lemon Lima" premiered on June 20, 2009 at the Los Angeles Film Festival and was released theatrically on March 4, 2011.

<doc id="19968071" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19968071" title="Pop culture pathology">
Pop culture pathology

Pop culture pathology (or Popular culture pathology) is the forensic study of popular culture in fields such as celebrity, music, fashion, food, aesthetic desire, television, as well as additional and often obscure media and stimuli. Pop culture pathology is an obscure branch of both Critical Theory and Cultural Studies. 
Originating in private universities in the United States around the turn of the millennium, pop culture pathology is the systematic attempt to analyze trends in culture in order to examine more closely the relationships that the individual has to the world around them. The studies include experiments with the aesthetic experiences that people have in common, with the goal being to uncover the intrinsic trend that allows for the phenomenon of extrinsic trends. Some common philosophical foundations for this tradition are Michel Foucault and the philosophy of deconstruction pioneered by Jacques Derrida.
The Botto Experiment.
The most common way to test theories in pop culture pathology is to attempt to simulate situations of complete cultural ignorance. For example, a test done in 2005 at University of California, Berkeley, is referred to as the "Botto Experiment". A young student named Nicholas Botto was given a CD on its release date that had received no radio play and which he had no exposure to. He listened to only this album for two months and was readmitted to society. He was told to return in a year's time with 5 albums that he found he enjoyed in light of the album he had been assigned. In the experiment the album that was famously used was "In An Aeroplane Over The Sea" by the indie rock band Neutral Milk Hotel. The style of music was known as "Lo-Fi" which was uncommon at the time. A year later Botto returned with five similar albums. His choices perfectly predicted a generation of music in the Lo-Fi genre, opening the door for pop culture pathology to be known as a legitimate subject.
Implications of Popular Culture Pathology.
The postmodern implications of this type of experimentation are still being realized by scientists and philosophers. By assigning meaning to a certain cultural item the person conducting the experiment is deciding what will matter in the entirety of the next year for the subject. It seems to go without saying that this type of influence poses solutions for current cultural trends that are deemed "immoral." By making the greater good more fashionable socially many of the worlds problems have the potential to be fixed in the future.
Failures of Popular Culture Pathology.
Unfortunately the Botto Experiment caused irreversible side effects. The cultural boom that the experiment predicted engulfed the subject forcing an end to the next stage of the experiment. Next, the subject was supposed to be given the same album a second time and told to return with an additional five. The second phase was supposed to show the instability of modern society and the impossibility of forcing the individual to move against it. This was proven wrong as the subject returned to the same five albums as before, effectively ruining the study.
Macro Ventures in PCP.
This type of experiment has taken place on different scales and in different ways. For example, the Music Genome Project has created a service known as Pandora Radio that allows the user to connect with various types of music according to extremely limited initial criteria. This type of conditioning is also present in the latest incarnation of Apple's iTunes. The new "Genius" feature allows the user to discover music that perpetuates their current cultural trend, furthering the flawed results of the perplexing but vastly studied Botto Experiment.
What comes next?
Academia has been waiting anxiously for the next manifestation of popular culture pathology. The anticipation has caused the creation of two different views on the subject. One, pioneered in the United States, predicts that the science will next try to cause moral reform. Much fear surrounds this popular view but more than that there is suspicion that the sentiment has simply been placed at the influence of another experiment in the field itself. Given the ironic nature of the study it seems likely that the next manifestation will be at the hands of the next philosopher daring enough to repeat the Botto Experiment with a focus on the field of popular culture pathology instead of popular culture itself.
The second prediction arose in Europe and is more secular. Philosophers there believe that popular culture pathology is the end of the moral focus of the "new world." The term "new world" has been used here in order to call attention to the fact that the Americas have habitually been ahead of Europe technologically, but far behind intellectually. The idea that morality is facing its doom is generally coming, again, from postmodern European philosophy (see Nietzsche, Baudrillard, Heidegger) predicting the realization that meaning is being assigned by the institution not the individual. This brings the field back to Michel Foucault and the problem of the individual. This view harbors intense curiosity at the cyclical nature of the study. In the end only time will tell the future of this curious new field of study.

Trinity Episcopal Cathedral (Portland, Oregon)

Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Portland, Oregon is the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Oregon of The Episcopal Church. The cathedral is located at 147 N.W. 19th Ave., Portland, Oregon 97209, in the Northwest District.
The legal name of the cathedral corporation is "Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, Portland, Oregon". It was originally organized on March 18, 1873 as "Trinity Episcopal Church, Portland, Oregon" and was renamed Cathedral on February 17, 1994 after the Episcopal Bishop of Oregon relocated the diocesan seat to the current location in the previous year. The Rt. Rev. Robert Louis Ladehoff, the Eighth Bishop of Oregon, consecrated the Cathedral on November 19, 1993. Prior to 1993, the seat of the Diocese of Oregon was then-Cathedral of St. John the Baptist since 1973, which, in turn was relocated from then St. Stephen's Cathedral.
The Cathedral serves as the central parish of the Episcopal diocese whose jurisdiction includes the parts of Oregon west of the Cascade Mountains. Approximately 1800 active parishioners attend the Cathedral's holy eucharist services and participate in various activities. In addition, Trinity Episcopal Cathedral has operated since 2002 the Center for Spiritual Development under the direction of the Rev. Canon Marianne Wells Borg; the Center was merged with the Cathedral's adult education program on August 1, 2008.
The Dean of the Cathedral is the Very Reverend William Lupfer, who is assisted by the Rev. Canon Nathan LeRud (Spiritual Formation and Catechesis), and the Rev. Canon Raggs Ragan (Canon Pastor), as well as a number of non-stipendiary clergypersons such as the Very Rev. Roy Coulter (former Dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, Portland), the Very Rev. Hollingshead "Lin" Knight (former Dean of the Cathedral Church of St. Andrew, Honolulu, Hawaii), the Very Rev. John Bright, the Rev. Canon Jack Hilyard, the Rev. Canon Joseph Dubay, the Rev. Canon Patrick Tompter, the Rev. John Scannel, the Rt. Rev. Robert Ladehoff, the Rev. Maureen Tighe, and the Rev. Deacon Valerie Ivey. New Testament scholar and author Dr. Marcus Borg serves as Canon Theologian.
History.
In 1853 the congregation had grown to 25 parishioners, and called its first rector, the Rev. John D. McCarty. Construction began on a permanent building, located at the corner of Southwest Second Avenue and Oak Street in Portland on land donated by parishioner Benjamin Stark, a prominent lawyer and citizen. When this building, essentially a log cabin, was consecrated by the newly elected Missionary Bishop of the vast Missionary District of the Oregon and Washington Territories, the Right Rev. Thomas Fielding Scott, it was the first Episcopal church building north of San Francisco and west of St. Paul.
By 1871, Trinity had grown to over 200 members. The congregation had purchased a half block at the corner of Southwest Sixth Avenue and Oak Street for $3,000. In 1872 a new church building was built on this site that was thought to more accurately reflect the congregation's (and the City of Portland's) stature. The Vestry voted that the Chancel window of this church was to be a memorial to Bishop Thomas F. Scott. This window, which was saved when 1872 building burned, is now in the East wall of the present Cathedral. The congregation in this period included many prominent Portlanders, including Cicero Hunt Lewis, Sylvester Pennoyer, Rodney Glisan, and Matthew Deady. In 1873, Trinity was involved in the founding of Good Samaritan Hospital. In 1902, the church building at Sixth and Oak was heavily damaged by fire, and the congregation decided to relocate yet again, to the more fashionable NW 19th Avenue, where many wealthy parishioners lived. This new building, in which the congregation still worships, was consecrated on October 14, 1906. The stained glass windows, the work of the Charles J. Connick Studios of Boston, date from the late 1940s.
In the late 1970s the Episcopal Church was undergoing a period of liturgical renewal, with the adoption of a new Book of Common Prayer. Under the leadership of Trinity's rector, the Reverend William H. Wagner, Jr., the Cathedral was redesigned and renovated to better reflect a new understanding of worship. The altar was moved forward, closer to the congregation, and the chancel was redesigned to allow for more flexible seating. This redesign, completed in 1983, coincided with the building of a new organ, and Trinity hired young organ designer Manuel Rosales to begin construction on a new instrument. In 1987 the Rosales Organ, Opus 11, was completed and has since earned acclaim as one of the finest organs in the country.

Columbia River Knife &amp; Tool

Columbia River Knife & Tool (CRKT) is an American knife company established in 1994, and currently based in Tualatin, Oregon, United States. The company's president and sales executive is Rod Bremer and the finance executive is Peggy Bremer. Though based in the United States most of its products are manufactured in China and Taiwan.
History.
CRKT was founded in 1994 by Paul Gillespi and Rod Bremer. Both individuals were formerly employed with Kershaw Knives. The company did not truly take off until the 1997 Shot Show when the K.I.S.S (Keep It Super Simple) knife was introduced. The small folder, designed by Ed Halligan was a success. Within the opening days of the show the years worth of the product was sold out. They sold at 4-5 times original production numbers resulting in a tripling of production efforts.
On October 3 of 2000 US Customs seized a shipment of 80,000 CRKT folding knives worth more than $4.3 million. All 50 models seized had always passed every Customs test in prior situations. The shipment had cleared Customs on September 29 but on October 3 an inspector decided that the knives acted like switchblades despite the fact that none of them fit within the definition set forth by the U.S. Switch Blade Knife Act of 1958. On October 17 a letter was co-signed by Oregon U.S. Congresswoman Darlene Hooley and Senator Gordon Smith that petitioned the head of Customs to aid CRKT. Because of their action there was a Federal inquiry of the US Customs actions that had to be answered within thirty days. On October 20 the company was once again allowed to move their product. However this was not before losing over $1 million in sales and spending over $30,000 on legal fees.
Products.
The company produces a wide range of fixed blades and folding knives, multi-tools, sharpeners, and carrying systems. CRKT has collaborated with custom knifemakers such as Ken Onion, Harold "Kit" Carson, Allen Elishewitz, Pat Crawford, Liong Mah, Steven James, Greg Lightfoot, Michael Walker, Ron Lake, Tom Veff, Steve Ryan, and the Graham Brothers.
Patents.
CRKT owns fifteen patents and patents pending. These include the AutoLAWKS (Lake And Walker Knife Safety) locking mechanism, the Outburst assist opening mechanism, Lock Back Safety (L.B.S.) mechanism, and Veff-Serrated edges. 
AutoLAWKS folders are essentially standard locking liner folders with an extra safety feature. The Lawks system was developed by Ron Lake and Michael Walker. There is an extra piece of metal that keeps the lock in the locked position once opened. There is a small piece of metal with a circular cut out mounted on the pivot pin in between the locking liner and the handle scale. The small disk shaped piece has three protrusions. There is a small flange that sticks out at a right angle to the rest of piece, opposite that is a finger stud, and next to the stud is an attachment point for a small spring. When the knife is opened the spring rotates the piece so that the flange is wedged between the handle scale and the lock preventing the lock from being dislodged. To close the knife the stud must be pulled away from the blade rotating the disk so that the flange is out of the way of the lock. While the stud is depressed the knife is closed in the same manner as any other liner lock.
The Outburst is the company's proprietary mechanism for their assisted-opening knives. These knives are standard pivot joint liner lock or frame lock folding knife. Inside the knife there is a spring tab that catches the tang of the blade as it is manually opened. Once the blade reaches thirty degrees the spring takes over and quickly snaps the knife open.
The Lock Back Safety mechanism, also invented by Ron Lake, is similar in function to the LAWKS mechanism. It is a lockback folder with a switch that can prevent the locking bar from being depressed. Inside the handle there is a small rod with a flange near the butt of the handle. The other end is connected to a switch near the pivot end. When the switch is pulled back (away from the pivot) the lock functions as a regular lockback. When the switch is closed the flange on the rod slides under tip of the locking bar at the butt end. This prevents the depression of the bar and the blade from unlocking. When the knife is closed the system functions the same way to lock it closed or allow it to open.
Veff-Serrations were developed by Tom Veff, a sharpener and knife maker, and are exclusively licensed to CRKT for production. The Veff-Serrations differ from standard ones in that they are large and set at an angle of 60 degrees whereas most serrations are small and arranged 90 degrees from the cutting surface.

SeaPort Airlines uses the callsign "Sasquatch" to communicate with air traffic controllers. The carrier played off this in early 2013 when it introduced "Roger, The SeaPort Airlines Sasquatch" as the airline's mascot. 
Fleet.
SeaPort uses a fleet of nine-passenger, single engine Pilatus PC-12 and Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft. Wings of Alaska operates both Cessna Caravan 208 and Cessna 207 aircraft.
Operations and Amenities.
SeaPort Airlines operates scheduled commuter service, connecting rural communities to the national transportation network across the Pacific Northwest and Mid-South. Beginning May 1, 2013, SeaPort Airlines will serve Burbank, Imperial/El Centro, and San Diego, California
Pacific Northwest Service.
SeaPort's Pacific Northwest Service at its Portland International Airport (PDX) hub was historically targeted at commuters between Seattle and Portland wishing to avoid congestion at the larger Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and the main commercial terminal at Portland International Airport. In late 2011, Seaport began to reinvent its business model and the carrier ended its namesake route between Seattle (Boeing Field) and Portland on January 27, 2012.
As part of this business shift, on January 15, 2012 SeaPort Airlines began nonstop flights between Portland International Airport and North Bend/Coos Bay (Southwest Oregon Regional Airport) utilizing Cessna Caravan aircraft. 
On October 21, 2008, SeaPort Airlines was awarded a two-year government grant to provide commercial service from Portland to Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton beginning December 1, 2008, replacing subsidized service by Horizon Air.
Mid-South Service.
The entirety of SeaPort's Mid-South service based at Memphis International Airport and Kansas City International Airport is federally subsidized under the Essential Air Service. 
On March 12, 2010, SeaPort won a two year Essential Air Service contract to provide three daily flights Sunday through Friday between Salina, Kansas and Kansas City International Airport. As part of this growth SeaPort secured Department of Transportation approval to add daily flights between Kansas City International Airport and Harrison, Arkansas. In July 2011, SeaPort began service to Dallas Love Field from El Dorado and Hot Springs.
In February 2013, SeaPort Airlines announced that its contract to provide Essential Air Service (“EAS”) at McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport has been extended by the US Department of Transportation through January 31, 2014. The carrier had been awarded a one-year, rather than the typical two-year contract, due to the low number of passengers that used the flights operated by the previous carrier providing EAS, which had put Jackson’s continued eligibility for subsidized air service at risk.
California Service.
On May 1, 2013, the airline began service connecting Imperial/El Centro to San Diego and Burbank. The EAS contract was awarded to SeaPort in January 2013, replacing incumbent carrier SkyWest Airlines, which linked Imperial to Los Angeles.

Louisiana French

Louisiana French (, Louisiana Creole: "françé la lwizyann") refers to the group of French dialects spoken in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and formerly elsewhere in colonial Lower Louisiana. It comprises several distinct varieties. Figures from the United States Census report that roughly 3.5% of Louisianans over the age of 5 were claimed to speak French or a French-based creole in their homes.
The most widely spoken form of Louisiana French is Cajun French, sometimes known as Louisiana Regional French. It developed after the arrival of Acadian migrants during the Great Upheaval of the 18th century. A prestige dialect known as Colonial or Plantation Society French was formerly prominent, but has now largely been subsumed into the Cajun dialect. Additionally, Louisiana Creole French is a related creole language.
Speakers of Louisiana French identify ethno-racially as Creole, French Creole, Spanish Creole, Mississippi Creole, Alabama Creole, Texas Creole, California Creole, African-American, Black, Chitimacha, Houma, Biloxi, Tunica, Choctaw, White, Cajun, Acadian, French, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Syrian, Lebanese, Irish and others. Individuals and groups of individuals, through innovation, adaptation and contact, continually enrich the French language spoken in Louisiana, seasoning it with linguistic features sometimes only found in Louisiana.
Education.
French-language Public School Curriculum (French Immersion).
As of Autumn 2011, Louisiana has French-language total immersion or bilingual French and English immersion in ten parishes: Calcasieu, Acadia, St. Landry, St. Martin, Iberia, Lafayette, Assumption, East Baton Rouge, Jefferson and Orleans. Students placed in the program begin in kindergarten or 1st grade and continue until high school.
The curriculum in both the total French-language immersion as well as in the bilingual program follows the same standards as all other schools in the parish and state.
The Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) recruits teachers locally and globally each year.
Les Amis de l'Immersion, Inc. is the parent-teacher organization for students in French immersion in the state. Les Amis organizes summer camps, fundraisers and outreach for teachers, parents and students in the program.
The immersion programs as of Autumn 2011 are as follows:
CODOFIL Consortium of Louisiana Universities and Colleges.
The Consortium of Louisiana Universities and Colleges unites representatives of French programs in Louisiana Universities and Colleges, and organizes post-secondary level Francophone scholastic exchanges and provide support for University students studying French language and linguistics in Louisiana.
Language Properties.
Grammar and Syntax.
The grammar and syntax of Louisiana French is the same as that of French spoken elsewhere in the world. There are, however, some syntactical features that were once present in the French-speaking world, that remain present in Louisiana. The difference between "je étais après manger" and "j'étais après manger" ("I was eating"; cf. Irish English "I was after eating") is in the spelling; there is no audible difference.
Vocabulary.
Lexically, Louisiana French differs only minutely from other varieties of French spoken in the world. However, there are several lexical treats stemming from many linguistic origins; some are unique to Louisiana French, while others are shared sporadically throughout the Francophone world. 
Place Names.
Place names in Louisiana French usually differ from those in International French. For instance, locales named for American Indian tribes usually use the plural article (les) before the name, instead of the masculine or feminine singular article (le/la). Likewise, movement towards those locations necessitates the plural – aux – before the place name.
In informal Louisiana French, most US states and countries are pronounced in English and therefore require no article (California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Mexico, Colorado, Mexico, Belgium, Morocco, Lebanon, etc.).
In formal Louisiana French, prefixed articles are absent, however the names of the states and countries usually are in French (Californie, Texas, Floride, Belgique, Liban).
Contractions.
In informal Louisiana French, often contractions are absent.
Examples:
(I learned from the grandparents).
Instead of *"J'ai appris des grand-parents".
Instead of *"La lumière du ciel".
Creole language influences.
Francophones and Creolophones have worked side-by-side, lived amongst one another and have enjoyed local festivities together throughout the history of the state. As a result, in regions where both Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole are spoken (or once were), the inhabitants of the region often code switch, beginning the sentence in one language and completing it in another.
Taxonomy.
Taxonomies for classing Louisiana French have changed over time. Until the 1960s and 1970s, Louisianans themselves, when speaking in French, referred to their language as français, or créole. In English, they referred to their language as Creole French, and French, simultaneously.
In 1968, Lafayette native James Domengeaux, a US Congressman and State Representative, created the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), whose mission was to oversee the promotion, visibility and expansion of French language usage in Louisiana. His mission is clear: (re)create a European French bastion in Louisiana by making all Louisianans bilingual in International French and English. To accomplish his goals, he teamed up with political leaders in Canada and France, including former French President Georges Pompidou. Louisiana French, he found too limiting, so he imported Francophone teachers from Europe, Canada and the Caribbean to teach normative French in Louisiana schools. His penchant for International French caused him to lose support in Louisiana: Louisianans, if they were going to have French in Louisiana schools, wanted Louisiana French, not "Parisian French."
Simultaneously, an ethnic movement took root in South Louisiana led by Francophones like James Donald Faulk, Dudley Joseph Leblanc and Jules O. Daigle. James Donald Faulk, a French teacher in Crowley, Louisiana, introduced using the term Cajun French, for which he created a Curriculum Guide, or Teacher and Student Manual for institutionalizing the language in schools in 1977. Roman Catholic Priest Jules O. Daigle, who in 1984 published his Dictionary of the Cajun Language, followed him. Cajun French is intended to imply a variety of French spoken in Louisiana by descendants of Acadians, an ethnic qualifier rather than a linguistic relationship.
Linguists and social scientists then categorized Louisiana French into a tripartite system based on colonial class lines: Colonial French or Plantation Society French, Napoleonic French, Acadian French/Cajun French and Louisiana Creole French, though these academic terms did not last long before quickly fading away.
In 2009, Iberia Parish native and activist Christophe Landry introduced three terms representing lexical differences based on Louisiana topography: Provincial Louisiana French (PLF), Fluvial Louisiana French (FLF) and Urban Louisiana French (ULF).
That same year, the Dictionary of Louisiana of Louisiana French, subtitled "as spoken in Cajun, Creole and American Indian communities," was published. It was edited by a coalition of linguists and other activists. The title clearly suggests that the ethno-racial identities are mapped onto the languages, but the language, at least linguistically, remains shared across those ethno-racial lines.
These are the academic taxonomies applied to categorizations of Louisiana French. With nationwide ethnicization came internal sub-divisions that, some of the state's inhabitants, insist are ancestral varieties. As a result, it is not odd to hear the language referred to as French, Canadian French, Acadian French, Broken French, Old French, Creole French, Cajun French and so on. Still other Louisiana Francophones will simply refer to their language as French, without qualifiers. Internally, two broad distinctions will be made: formal French ("good French" or "proper French") and informal French ("broken French").
Formal French.
Formal French is the language used in all administrative and ecclesiastic documents, speeches and in literary publications. This variety of French, also known as Urban Louisiana French (ULF), is spoken in the urban business centers of the state. These regions have historically been centers of trade, commerce and contact with speakers of French from Europe. This would include New Orleans and its environs, Baton Rouge and its environs, St. Martinville (here, along class lines) and other once important Francophone business centers in the state. ULF sounds almost identical to Standard International French, with guttural Rs and intonation that varies from European to North American.
Informal French.
This variety of Louisiana French, also known as Provincial Louisiana French (PLF), Cajun French and Acadian French, or le cadien, has its roots in agrarian Louisiana, but is now also found in urban centers due to urbanization beginning in the 20th century.
Historically, along the prairies of Southwest Louisiana, Francophone Louisianans were cattle grazers and rice and cotton farmers.
Along the bayous and the Louisiana littoral, sugar cane cultivation dominated and in many parishes today, sugar cultivation remains an important source of economy (e.g. Iberia and St. Martin parishes).
In this variety of LF, the Rs are alveolar (not guttural, they’re flat), the AU in words becomes /aw/, the vowels at the beginning and end of words is usually omitted (Américain -> Méricain, Espérer -> Spérer). Likewise the letter O following an É frequently disappears in spoken informal LF all together (Léonide -> Lonide, Cléophas -> Clophas).
The nasality and pitch in PLF is akin to pitch and intonation associated with provincial speech in Québec. In terms of nasality, Louisiana French is not far different from French spoken in Brussels, Paris and Dakar (Senegal). Among these three varieties, and others, there is, however, a difference in stress (inflection, accentuation), rhythm (cadence and lilt), articulation, timbre (character and quality of each phoneme, or sound), form and sound fluctuations (modulation), and tone (intonation). The pitch of PLF and Provincial Quebec French (PQF) share a predominantly agricultural history, close contact with pre-Columbian peoples and relative isolation from urbanized populations.
Bayou Lafourche French.
Particular mention should be made to the Francophones of Bayou Lafourche. There’s an interesting linguistic phenomenon here that is absent everywhere else in Louisiana. Some Francophones along Bayou Lafourche pronounce the G and J in French as the English letter H (as done in Spanish), and others pronounce these two letters in the ordinary manner of other Francophones.
Two theories exist to explain this unique feature. On the one hand, some activists and linguists attribute this feature to an inheritance of Acadian French spoken in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and other Canadian maritime provinces, a theory based entirely on observation of shared vocal features rather than the communities being linked by migration.
On the other hand, it has been suggested that there may be a linguistic link to the Creole Hispanophones living at the Mississippi River and Bayou Lafourche junction, who were more numerous than the Acadians who lived in the immediate vicinity.
Interesting side note: the Louisiana Creole spoken in Lafourche Parish in and around Kraemer, Choctaw, Bayou Bœuf and Chackbay contains the letters G and J, but they are voiced as they are in LC spoken elsewhere in the state, and as the French spoken elsewhere – not as the aspirated Hs in Lower Bayou Lafourche French.
Music.
Musically, Louisiana French is and has been the traditional language for singing music now referred to as Cajun, Zydeco, and Louisiana French Rock. Today, Cajun, Creole Stomp, and Louisiana French Rock remain the only three genres of music in Louisiana utilizing French instead of English. In Zydeco, most artists interject expressions and phrases in French in songs predominantly sung in Louisiana English.
Healing Practices.
Medicine men and women, or healers, called traiteur/traiteuse in French, are still found throughout the state. During their rituals for healing, it is often French that is employed to summon the gods for a speedy recover to normalcy.
Infrastructure.
Signage, packaging, and documentation in French exists throughout the state. Beginning in the 1990s, when cultural and ethnic tourism proved a lucrative enterprise, luring large numbers of Francophones to Louisiana, State and local tourism bureau commissions were influential in convincing city, parish and state officials to produce bilingual signage and documentation. French and English bilingual signage is therefore usually confined to the old districts of cities, like the French Quarter in New Orleans, downtown Lafayette, New Iberia (trilingual with Spanish), St. Martinville, Breaux Bridge, and several other cities. Locals continue to refer to the place names in English and for postal services the English version is generally preferred.
To meet the demands of a growing Francophone tourist market, tourism bureaus and commissions throughout the state, but particularly in southern Louisiana, have information on tourist sites in both French and English (as well as in other major languages spoken by tourists).
Similarly, the state government passed measures in 2011 to provide Louisiana French Language Services at the governmental level, with particular mention to cultural tourism and local culture and heritage. The legislative act was drafted and presented by Francophone and Francophile Senators and Representatives. It asserts that the French language is vital to the economy of the state. Accordingly, the bill sets forth that each branch of the state government shall take necessary action to identify employees who are proficient in French. Each branch of the state government shall also take necessary steps in producing services in the Louisiana French language for both locals and visitors. This bill is, however, an unfunded state mandate.

Modoc Northern Railroad

The Modoc Northern Railroad is a defunct railroad company that operated over of track in northeastern California and southern Oregon and was based in Tulelake, California. The railroad connected Klamath Falls to Alturas, California, and Lakeview, Oregon, to Alturas, California. The railroad shipped mostly timber products and some perlite from the mine and mill near Lakeview.
The rails used by the Modoc Northern were first laid out in June 1927 by a non-operating subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Company with the same name. On November 1, 2005, Union Pacific Railroad leased the Modoc line, connecting Klamath Falls to Alturas, to the MNRR for five years. By request of the Lake County, Oregon, commissioners, the MNRR also took over operation of the Lake County Railway, connecting Alturas to Lakeview, in 2006. UP cancelled the lease on May 5, 2009, and a new operator has assumed control of Lake County Railway.

<doc id="19968197" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19968197" title="The Game of Cootie">
The Game of Cootie

The Game of Cootie is a children's roll-and-move tabletop game for two to four players. The object is to be the first to build a three-dimensional bug-like object called a "cootie" from a variety of plastic body parts. Created by William Schaper in 1948, the game was launched in 1949 and sold millions in its first years. In 1973, "Cootie" was acquired by Tyco Toys, and, in 1986, by Hasbro subsidiary Milton Bradley. The game was given a new look and continued to enjoy commercial success. Several companies published cootie games in the first half of the twentieth century but only Schaper's featured a free-standing, three-dimensional cootie. In 2003, "Cootie" was named to the Toy Industry Association's "Century of Toys List".
Game play.
The object of the original 1949 game is to be the first player to build a "cootie" piece by piece from various plastic body parts that include a beehive-like body, a head, antennae, eyes, a coiled proboscis, and six legs. Body parts are acquired following the player's roll of a die, with each number on the die corresponding to one of the body parts. The body corresponds to one, the head to two, three to the antennas (feelers), four to the eye, five to the proboscis (mouth), and six to the leg. The first part to be acquired must be the body, and then the head. All other body parts may then be acquired in any order. When a player acquires a part, an additional throw of the die is allowed in an attempt to acquire another part. The winner is the first player to completely assemble a cootie.
Etymology.
The earliest recorded use of the word "cootie" appears in Albert N. Depew's World War I memoir, "Gunner Depew" (1918): "Of course you know what the word 'cooties' means...When you get near the trenches you get a course in the natural history of bugs, lice, rats and every kind of pest that had ever been invented." The word may be derived from Malayian "kutu", a head louse. In North American English, children use the word to refer to a fictitious disease or condition, often infecting members of the opposite sex. Among children, the word effectively serves as a device for enforcing separation of the sexes.
Design and product history.
In 1948, Minneapolis, Minnesota postman William H. Schaper whittled a bug-like fishing lure he believed had toy potential, and sold it (and others like it) in his store as a sideline to his homebound business of manufacturing small commercial popcorn machines. Eventually, he created a game around his creation, and, in 1949, molded it in plastic and formed the W. H. Schaper Mfg. Co. Inc..
Schaper offered Dayton's, a local department store, several "Cootie" sets on consignment and the game proved a hit, selling 5,592 by the end of 1950. By 1952, Schaper's company sold 1.2 million "Cootie" games, and thereafter, a million games a year. By the mid-1960s, Schaper's company was selling more than twenty-five different games from its Golden Valley, Minnesota headquarters. In Australia, the game was distributed by Toltoys in the late 60s under the title "Creepy Critters". "Cootie" was one of many revamped traditional games cast in plastic by the Schaper company. Several games had bug titles such as "Tickle Bee", "Inch Worm", and "Tumble Bug".
The company eventually produced "Cootie" spinoffs such as "Giant Cootie" and "Deluxe 6 Cootie", a game with six cooties instead of four. In the late 1960s, Sears offered an exclusive "Cootie House" with a vinyl mat and eight Cooties.
Tyco Toys bought W.H. Schaper Mfg. Co. Inc. in 1973 and manufactured the game with a change in graphics but little change to the original game. In 1986, Hasbro, through its subsidiary Milton Bradley Co., arranged with Tyco Toys Inc. to purchase "Cootie" and three other games from the Schaper Toy Division of Kusan Inc.. Milton Bradley brought a new look to "Cootie" with legs that sported in-line skates, sneakers, and other accessories.
Though the Schaper company published other games including "Ants in the Pants", "Don't Spill the Beans", and "Don't Break the Ice", "Cootie" remained the company's best seller with over 50 million games sold between 1949 and 2005.
Other cootie games.
Schaper's game was not the first based upon the insect known as the "cootie". The creature was the subject of several tabletop games, mostly pencil and paper games, in the decades of the twentieth century following World War I. The "Cootie Game" fashioned by the Irvin-Smith Company about 1915 was a hand-held game that involved tilting capsules into a trap over a background illustration depicting a WWI battlefield. In 1927, the J. H. Warder Company of Chicago released "Tu-Tee", and the Charles Bowlby Company released "Cootie"; though based on a "build a bug" concept similar to Schaper's, both were paper and pencil games. In 1937, Rork's released "The Game of Cootie", and it too was a paper and pencil game. A paper and pencil party game called "Beetle" is popular in Britain but its date of origin is unknown. In 1939, Transogram published "Cootie", a game featuring a three-dimensional wooden bug assembled in a die-cut tray. Schaper's game was the first to employ a fully three-dimensional, free-standing plastic cootie.
Legacy.
Schaper's plastic bug has become an icon, and, for some, a symbol for the baby boomer generation. In 2003, the Toy Industry Association included "Cootie" on its "Century of Toys List" of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.

The CF05 () submachine gun developed by Chongqing Changfeng in early 1990s in response to China's demand for a new submachine gun design. It was developed by the same team who designed the QSZ-92 pistol, which is now the main pistol used by PLA and PAP. CF05 design is chambered for 9x19 DAP-92 ammunition, used internationally for most pistols and sub machine guns used by armed forces and law enforcement.
Development.
Development of the CF05 started from 1993 to 1994 with the design finalized in 2004. In March 2004, the prototype went through a review before the design was finalized in May to August of 2005. The CF05 submachine gun is a blowback-operated system. Magazine is a 50-round helical made from translucent polymer, located at the top of the weapon. Early prototypes had secondary feed option, with pistol magazine inserted into the pistol grip. CF05 submachine gun is fitted with open sights, and has a mounting point rail for optics situated to the rear of the sight block. Threads in the barrel allow the weapon to attach silencer. Shoulder stock is retractable, and is made from polymer material.
The CF05 can be outfitted with a laser sight.
