Laotian society

Laotian society is a society characterized by semi-independent rural villages engaged in subsistence agricultural production. Ethnic, geographic, and ecological differences create variations in the pattern of village life from one part of the country to another, but the common threads of village self reliance, limited regional trade and communication, and identification with one's village and ethnic group persist regardless of the setting. Rural trade networks, however, have been a part of life since the 1950s. Except near the larger towns and in the rich agricultural plains of Vientiane and Savannakhét, villages are spaced at least several kilometers apart and the intervening land variously developed as rice paddy and swidden fields or maintained as buffer forest for gathering wild plants and animals, fuelwood, and occasional timber harvest.
Ethnicity differentiates the villages but is usually not a source of conflict or antagonism. Nearly all villages are ethnically homogeneous, although a few include two or more distinct groups. Ethnic mixing often has resulted from different groups migrating to a new settlement site at about the same time, or a larger village at a crossroads or river transit point developing into a minor trading center. Ethnic identity is never absolutely immutable. Some minority Laotian individuals have adopted lowland Lao behavior and dress patterns, or intermarried with lowland Lao, and have effectively acculturated to lowland society. In some units, military service has also brought together Laotians of different ethnic groups, both before and after 1975.
Since 1975, there has been more sense of national unity among most rural villagers. Precolonial governments depended more on a system of control at the district level with the chao muang (district chief) maintaining his own allegiance and tribute to the state. Administrative practices under the French and during the post-World War II period were confined primarily to provincial and a few district centers. The government was able to extract taxes with some facility but had little impact on the daily lives or thoughts of most villagers. However, since 1975, the government has expended considerable energy and resources on national unification, so that even isolated villages recognize the role of local government and consider themselves at some level to be part of a Laotian state.
Lowland Lao society.
"Lao Loum" (Laotian of the valley), have been the dominant group- -numerically, politically, and economically—since the founding of the Kingdom of Lan Xang in the fourteenth century. The Lao of the Lao Loum ethnic group comprise just over 50 percent of the total population. Other related lowland groups include the Lue and Phu Thai, who together make up an additional 15% of the population. Groups such as the Tai Dam and Tai Deng are included by government statistics in the general category Phu Thai despite linguistic and cultural differences from other lowland groups. Variations occur regionally and among different ethnic subgroups, but the general patterns are relatively uniform. Most officials in the RLG were Lao Loum, and despite increases in the number of minority officials in the government, the lowland Lao held a clear majority in the early 1990s. Lowland cultural patterns are frequently considered the norm in designing policy or setting development priorities.
Lao Loum traditionally live in stable independent villages situated near lowland rivers or streams. At higher elevations, villages are located in valley areas that give as much access as possible to land suitable for paddy rice cultivation. Villages are self-contained and range from around twenty to over 200 households, although they typically contain forty or fifty houses and 200 to 300 people. Usually, villages are separated by rice fields or unused land. In rural areas, there might be five kilometers or more between villages, whereas in more densely populated areas only one kilometer or less separates the settlements. Most villages have grown in population over time, and if good land becomes scarce in the vicinity, it is not uncommon for some families to migrate to another area, either individually or as a group. Individual households usually move to another village where the family has kin or friends, but larger groups have often migrated to unsettled areas. Such village fission or relocation continued into the early 1990s, although migrants had to obtain permission from the district administration before settling in a new site.
The traditional independence and relative isolation of lowland villages has been reduced since the late 1980s. Although commerce in forest products—for example, sticklac—dates to colonial times, as roads have improved and marketing networks expanded, the government has encouraged commercial production for trade and export. As long as the open economic policies of the New Economic Mechanism are operating, the process of integrating lowland villages into a national socioeconomic system will likely continue.
Lao Loum houses are built on wooden piles with the floor from one to two-and one-half meters above the ground. This style keeps the living area above the mud of the rainy season, provides a shady area under the house to work or rest during the day, and allows the house to catch breezes for natural cooling. Depending on the wealth and resources of the family, the walls and floor may be made of woven split bamboo or sawn wood; the roof is constructed from grass thatch, bamboo, wood shingles, or corrugated steel roofing sheet. Some older houses in well-off villages are roofed with clay tiles, but this style was no longer common in the early 1990s. A separate rice granary is built in the house compound, also on posts using similar construction. Livestock is sometimes kept under the house.
Houses commonly range from five by seven meters to eight by twelve meters, with the smallest size typical of a newly established household or a family that has recently moved. Most houses are built with a porch on the long side that is used for visiting and as a public area. The interior is divided into one or two sleeping rooms, a common room for visiting and eating, and a separate kitchen area or side porch. Household furnishings are simple: mats or mattresses and blankets for sleeping on the floor, a low woven bamboo and rattan table for eating, and a few pots and dishes for cooking and eating. Lao Loum sit on the floor and eat from common bowls of soup or other dishes. Steamed rice is distributed among two or three common baskets placed around the edge of the table.
Lao Loum households average between six and eight persons, but may reach twelve or so in exceptional cases. The family structure is typically nuclear or stem: a married couple and their unmarried children, or an older married couple together with one married child and his or her spouse plus unmarried children and grandchildren. Because kinship is reckoned bilaterally and flexibly, Lao Loum may maintain close social relationships with kin who are only distantly related by blood. Terms of address for persons in an older generation distinguish whether the relationship is through the father's or mother's side and elder from younger siblings.
Marriage occurs through a blend of traditional and modern practices. In earlier generations, marriages may have been arranged by the families, but at least since the 1960s, most couples usually have made their own choice, which is communicated to the parents. A bride-price is negotiated, which often defrays the expenses of the wedding. The wedding takes place at the home of the bride's family, with whom the couple initially resides either in the same house or nearby. The groom helps with farming in the bride's family for several years until the couple feels they are economically ready to establish a separate household. Even then, they may continue to farm jointly with the older generation and either divide the harvest or eat from a common granary. A bride may sometimes move into her husband's household, but uxorilocal residence is somewhat more common. Initial uxorilocal residence combined with the sequential establishment of separate households by each older sibling frequently leaves the youngest daughter and her husband to care for the aged parents and ultimately to inherit the house. All the children divide lands and other valuables.
Polygyny is traditionally allowed but uncommon since the LPDR government outlawed it shortly after coming to power. Further, having multiple wives generally was restricted to the elite because it required the ability to maintain a larger household. However, many men have mistresses. Divorce may be initiated by either party. If a couple encounters domestic difficulties, the two families usually address the problem first. If necessary, the village elders join the attempt to resolve the couple's differences and achieve a reconciliation. After a divorce, both husband and wife may return to their families of birth, unless either can make a living other than from farming. Children of divorce may remain with either parent. In the case of a spouse's death, the widow or widower may return to their natal household but more commonly maintain an independent household or remarry. The choice often hinges on the ages of children; if none are old enough to help in the fields, the family has a difficult time surviving without extra help.
The lowland Lao village economy is centered on paddy rice cultivation, and most village activities and daily life revolve around rice production. Glutinous, or sticky rice is the staple food; because it has a high starch content, sticky rice must be steamed rather than boiled. It is eaten with the fingers and dipped in soup or a vegetable or meat dish. Most Lao Loum villages are self-sufficient in rice production, although the production of individual households within a village varies. Household work centers on paddy production from the beginning of the rains in May through December when all the rice has been brought to storage. Periods of intense work occur at the time of transplanting and harvesting, and cooperative work groups are often organized among several families to help get the tasks completed in a timely manner.
Where level terrain is inadequate, lowland Lao also practice swidden rice farming. This method is less efficient than paddy rice cultivation, which provides higher and more stable yields for less work. In certain villages, swidden rice is grown only in some years as a supplement to paddy rice production, whereas in others it is planted regularly in small quantities. Some Lao Loum villages have no land suitable for rice paddies and are completely dependent on swidden rice production. Newly established villages may first clear fields and plant swidden rice for a year or two before plowing and bunding the fields to convert them to paddies.
In addition to paddy rice, most households also have a small vegetable garden and some fruit trees, either in the house compound or near a stream or other water source. Other crops include cotton, tobacco, and sugarcane, but they are usually planted only in small quantities for personal use. Villagers also raise chickens, ducks, and pigs, as well as a buffalo or two for plowing the fields and perhaps a pair of cattle for pulling a cart. In general, rural households are largely self-sufficient, growing their own food, making their own tools and clothes, and trading any surplus for soap, kerosene, medicines, and kitchen or household goods.
Hunting, fishing, and gathering traditionally play an important role in the household economy, although as the population has increased and wild areas have been degraded, access to these resources has gradually deteriorated. Homemade rifles are used to hunt small deer, wild pigs, and small game such as squirrels and birds; fish are caught with a variety of nets, traps, or hooks. Bamboo shoots, mushrooms, fruit, medicinal or culinary roots, and leaves are gathered in the forest according to the season. Men hunt and fish with throw nets and hooks, while women fish with dip nets and baskets and collect roots and wild vegetables.
Household tasks are typically divided according to gender, but the divisions are not rigid, and men and women often perform tasks interchangeably. For example, both sexes cut and carry firewood. Women and children traditionally carry water for household use and to cultivate kitchen gardens. Women do most of the cooking, household cleaning, and washing and serve as primary caretakers for small children. They are the main marketers of surplus household food and other petty production, and women are usually the commercial marketers for vegetables, fruit, fish, poultry, and basic household dry goods. Men typically market cattle, buffalo, or pigs and are responsible for the purchase of any mechanical items. Intrafamily decision making usually requires discussions between husband and wife, but the husband usually acts as the family representative in village meetings or other official functions. In farming work, men traditionally plow and harrow the rice fields, while women uproot the seedlings before transplanting them. Both sexes transplant, harvest, thresh, and carry rice.
Occupational specialization in the village is low; virtually everyone is a rice farmer first. Some villagers may have special skills in weaving, blacksmithing, or religious knowledge, but these skills are supplementary to the fundamental task of growing enough rice and vegetables for the family. Social and economic stratification tends to be low within any one village, although villages may differ substantially one from another. Status accrues to age, wealth, skill in specific tasks, and religious knowledge. Factions based on kinship or political alliance may exist in a village but usually do not obstruct overall village cooperation and governance.
Traditionally, lowland Lao villages are led by a village chief (pho ban or nai ban) and one or two assistants who are elected by the villagers, although district or province officials sometimes use their positions to influence the results. Respected elders, including women, form an advisory group that deliberates intravillage disputes. Since 1975 villages have been governed by an administrative committee headed by a village president (pathan ban) and several other persons with responsibilities for such specific areas as economic and population records, self-defense militia, agriculture, women's affairs, and youth affairs. All members are in principle elected by popular vote, although for about a decade after 1975, party cadres at the village level were supposed to have taken an active role to ensure that acceptable candidates were selected.
Even under the present political system, however, village leaders have little or no formal authority and govern through consensus and the use of social pressure to ensure conformity. Village meetings are held infrequently but are usually well attended with different viewpoints on issues expressed openly. If a consensus on an issue is not reached, leaders will delay decisions to allow further discussion outside the meeting with all members of the community. Typical issues might include whether to build or expand a village school or dig a community well, or how to organize the annual ceremony for the village protective spirit. Historically, religious and ceremonial activities and ties with the Buddhist temple or monastery (wat) have been very important in village life and a focus of considerable time and expenditure.
Each family contributes equal amounts of labor, material, and money to village projects. Once a decision is made to undertake a project, a committee is appointed to manage the details and keep track of the contributions to ensure that everyone does his or her share. Systems of rotating labor groups for village projects are common; for example, groups of ten households may supply one worker per household every three to seven days, depending on the number of groups, until the project is finished. Some large projects, such as building a school, may continue for several years, with work taking place during the dry season when farming tasks are not heavy or when funds are available to purchase materials.
Households also cooperate informally, especially in agricultural work. Labor exchange occurs for almost every task associated with rice farming, although it is most common for transplanting, harvesting, and threshing. There are two different patterns of farm exchange. In central and southern Laos, villagers call on many other households, sometimes the entire village, for one day's help to complete a specific task such as transplanting. No specific repayment is required, but the family is obligated to help others in the village if they are unable to finish work in time. In northern villages, mutual assistance is organized on the basis of exchanges between families that should even out over the year; a day's work transplanting may be repaid by a day's work threshing. The contributions of men, women, and children over sixteen are considered equal, regardless of the task.
Houses are typically built by hand using local materials, and once the householder has collected enough wood, bamboo, and/or thatching grass, he will ask his neighbors and relatives to assist in the house raising. It usually takes twenty people a day or two to assemble the frame and raise the heavy timbers. Once the heavy work is completed, the owners finish construction over the ensuing weeks. In this work as well as farm labor exchange, the host family provides a meal to all those coming to help. For common farmwork, the meal is relatively simple and usually includes a chicken or duck and a bottle of local rice liquor. For a house raising, the meal is more elaborate—a pig or small ox and considerably more liquor after the task is done. Illness, death, or other household emergencies also elicit help from one's neighbors.
Lowland Lao are almost all Buddhists, and most villages have a wat, which serves as both a social and religious center. Whereas small villages may have only one or two monks in residence plus a few novice monks, larger villages may have up six monks plus novices. Many villagers assemble at the wat for prayers on the days of each lunar quarter; on days of major religious festivals, they carry out more elaborate ceremonies and may organize a boun (religious fair) at the wat. Before the development of a national education system, boys and young men received basic religious and secular education at the wat. The wat is frequently used as a place for village meetings, because the hall is often the only building large enough to accommodate everyone at once. Most villages have a small wat committee to oversee the maintenance of the building, organization of the fair, and the general welfare of the monks and novices. The committee members are selected by consensus on the basis of their morality and religious sincerity and usually have been monks at some time in their lives.
Although they are Buddhists, Lao Loum also respect the power of "phi" (spirits), which may be associated with a place or a deceased person. More important for village organization is the cult of a village protective deity, or phi ban, which is typically celebrated yearly. Many villages have abandoned this practice in the face of increased modernization and official discouragement by the government. However, some villages continued through the early 1990s to offer an annual sacrifice to the phi ban in a ceremony that both reaffirmed the importance of the village as a unique social unit and aimed to secure the continued good fortune of the village and its inhabitants.
Midland Lao society.
Lao Theung (Laotian of the mountain slopes), make up about 24 percent of the population and consist of at least thirty-seven different ethnic groups ranging in population from nearly 400,000—the Kammu—to fewer than 100—the Numbri. Many of the groups have additional members in Thailand or Vietnam. Of the three main ethnic classifications, the differences among the Lao Theung groups are greater than among the Lao Loum or Lao Sung. Little is known about many of these groups, and reasonably complete ethnographic accounts are available only for a few. Most Lao Theung groups reside in a relatively limited geographic area; for example, the Nyaheun, Sedang, and Larvae mostly live in the far southern provinces of Attapu and Saravan (Salavan), whereas the Lamet reside near the border between Bokeo, Oudômxai, and Louang Namtha provinces. The Kammu live scattered throughout the north, from Xiangkhoang to Bokeo.
The Lao Theung speak languages of the Austroasiatic family, and although some languages are closely related, such as Kammu, Lamet, and Sam Tao, others are mutually incomprehensible. None of the languages has developed a written script. The geographer Christian Taillard has suggested that the Lao Theung were originally paddy rice farmers displaced by Tai migrants into the hills and mountains and forced to turn to swidden rice production. However, Karl Gustav Izikowitz's ethnography of the Lamet reports that historically they had been swidden farmers and did not cultivate paddy rice even in areas where suitable land was available. Certainly within the last two centuries, all the Lao Theung have been characterized as swidden farmers and as semimigratory because they have occasionally relocated their villages as swidden areas were exhausted. The Kammu and Lamet, who are found in northern Laos, have different social organization and agricultural ecology than the ethnic groups in southern Laos.
Most Lao Theung villages (based primarily on descriptions of the Kammu) are located on mountain slopes but not at the peaks or ridges—the name Lao Theung means roughly "the Lao up there." Since the 1950s, however, a growing number of villages have been established at lower elevations near rivers or roads, which occurred as roads were beginning to be rebuilt and expanded. Sometimes these villages were founded by people fleeing the war, and sometimes they arose out of a desire to be closer to transportation, markets, and social services. After 1975 many Hmong and some Kammu were driven out by the Pathet Lao and the Lao People's Army. Since the 1980s, the government has encouraged upland swidden farming minorities to relocate to lowland areas in order to reduce upland swidden farming and forest clearing. Kammu and Lamet villages, as well as those of some other midland groups, are relatively permanent, some remaining over fifty years in a location. Traditionally, villages managed the rotation of swidden fields in such a way as to sustain agricultural production over long periods. Individual households might move from a village to another location, or villages might merge with a second village being established a short distance away; however, the usual pattern was sedentary. Midland groups inhabiting central Laos generally have been more mobile, with villages relocated after a decade or so. However, it is not clear whether this is a long- standing pattern or a response to the unsettled conditions during the Second Indochina War.
Lao Theung villages are usually somewhat smaller than most Lao Loum villages, commonly ranging between twenty and thirty households, but sites with fifty households and 300 or more inhabitants have been reported. Houses in Lamet and Kammu villages are clustered without apparent organization or orientation, but individual sites are selected with the advice of a village spirit practitioner. Lamet villages are commonly divided into two segments by the men's common house located in the middle of the village, but a similar practice has not been recorded for the Kammu. Traditionally, in Kammu households, there is a separate common house for adolescent boys and strangers, but this practice has not been continued in many new settlements established after 1975.
The houses are built on wooden or bamboo piles between one and two metres (6') above the ground and are at least five by seven metres (16' x 23') in size. Usually they are larger. Construction materials include woven bamboo or sawn lumber for floors and walls and grass thatch or bamboo shingle roofing. A kitchen hearth is located inside the house, and an open porch is built on at least one end of the house. A separate rice barn, also built on piles, may be located in the village near the house (Kammu) or on the edge of the village (Lamet). Villages are commonly built near a small stream to provide drinking and washing water, which is often diverted through a bamboo aqueduct to facilitate filling buckets and bathing.
Virtually all Lao Theung groups rely on swidden rice cultivation as the basis of their household economy. Lamet and Kammu prefer glutinous rice, but some other groups prefer to eat ordinary rice. A small field house is almost always built in the fields, and all or part of the family may sleep there for days during the farming season rather than walk back to the village every day.
Swidden rice seldom yields as much as paddy fields, and the labor needed to keep weeds under control is the major constraint to expanding the area farmed. Corn, cassava, and wild tubers are thus important components of the diet to supplement a frequently inadequate rice supply. As a consequence of low rice yields, Lao Theung are generally considered to be the poorest of the three ethnic groupings in Laos. Men often come to towns to work as coolies.
In addition to farming, Lao Theung engage in hunting and gathering in the forests surrounding the village. Men shoot or trap small game and occasionally a wild pig or deer. Both women and men regularly collect bamboo and rattan sprouts, wild vegetables, mushrooms, tubers, and medicinal plants, the latter marketed by women. Fishing is common for some groups but seldom practiced by others, perhaps as a consequence of living in an upland environment distant from large streams.
Damrong Tayanin, an anthropologist of Kammu origin, has described a pattern of land tenure for the Kammu in which households own a large number of separate fields that are farmed over a twelve- to fifteen-year rotation; other households recognize these ownership rights. The claimed fields are divided among the offspring of each generation. However, no other studies mention any Lao Theung group respecting permanent rights to swidden fields. In all cases, fields that are cleared and farmed are allowed to revert to fallow after a year or two. Depending on the population-to-land balance, these fields might be allowed to lie fallow for three to over fifteen years before being cleared again. After each harvest, individual households select the fields they will clear and farm the following year. Sometimes this choice is an individual decision, but sometimes a group of households cooperates to clear and fence a single large area, which is then divided. Or a village decides which area to clear and divide among all the families in the village. Once a field is abandoned, anyone may clear it and farm. Fallow periods shorter than five to seven years lead to gradual degeneration of the swidden system, however, because they do not allow adequate regrowth of vegetation to restore the soil fertility.
Virtually all Lao Theung groups are patrilineal. Kammu and Lamet households average between six and seven persons but may be as large as twelve or fourteen persons. The ideal household consists of parents and children, wives of married sons, and grandchildren. Married sons eventually establish separate households, but a family might be temporarily augmented by a son- in-law who must live and work with the bride's parents for several years in partial payment of the bride-price. The Kammu and Lamet have eight and seven totemic clans, respectively, which provide a basis for social organization and the regulation of marriage. For the Lamet, the clans are exogamous, and each village contains at least two clans, thus providing the possibility of marriage exchanges. Kammu group the clans according to three categories—quadruped, bird, or plant—depending on the clan's totem. The totem is a plant or animal that was instrumental in either saving or killing the legendary clan ancestor. One must marry someone from another clan, and more particularly, men should marry real or classificatory mother's brothers' daughters. Each group of clans (for example, quadruped) always gives brides to one of the others (for example, bird) and receives brides from the third (for example, plants) in a circular relationship. Thus a village must have all three clan categories represented for marriage exchanges to proceed.
Lamet clans help in establishing relationships between persons both inside and outside a village. In the village, members of the same clan are likely to develop cooperative relationships in farming, and a man traveling outside his village might seek out fellow clan members when arriving in another village. For the Kammu, however, clan membership appears relevant only for facilitating interhousehold cooperation and for regulating marriage relationships within a village. Should a family move to another village, they may change their clan membership in order to fit into the three-group marriage exchange circle.
Marriage choices are made by the groom and bride. Once a couple agrees to marry, their parents negotiate a bride-price. Among the Lamet, the bride's family also sends a dowry. Because there are few opportunities to acquire significant wealth in villages, Kammu and Lamet young men have frequently migrated to towns or to Thailand since the 1920s to work for several years until they acquire the funds needed for a bride-price. Among the Lamet, unmarried adolescent males sleep in the communal men's house, although they work with their families during the day.
Polygyny traditionally has been allowed, but it is rare, because few men can afford a second wife. Whereas a Lamet man may marry two sisters, this practice is prohibited among the Kammu; a widow may marry her husband's brother in either culture. If he chooses not to marry her, however, the brother is still responsible for her support. Initial residence after marriage is usually patrilocal, but if the groom is unable to pay the full agreed-upon bride-price, he may be obligated to live and work in his in-laws's household for several years in lieu of the bride-price. Upon the parents' death, the sons divide items of value and, according to Damrong, rights to swidden fields and fallows. Material possessions are generally limited and include—not much more than livestock, farm and household equipment, or perhaps a few silver coins—used in traditional dress—or ingots. Wooden and bronze drums were important symbols of Lamet and Kammu household wealth in the past, but most appear to have been lost or sold during the Indochina wars.
Gender role differentiation in both farming and household activities is considerably greater among the Lao Theung than among the Lao Loum. Men are primarily responsible for clearing and burning swidden fields, although women may assist in clearing the smaller brush. Men punch holes for seed and the women follow, dropping and covering the seed with topsoil. Both sexes weed the fields, but the women are primarily responsible for this time- consuming task. Harvest is a joint activity. In the house, women cook, care for children, husk rice, cut firewood, and haul water. Women also gather roots, shoots, and other wild vegetative products. Men weave baskets, repair farm tools, and hunt small game. Men are also more likely than women to manage household finances and engage in trade, typically selling livestock and collected forest products or scrap metal from the war in exchange for rice. Izikowitz reports a significant trade of surplus rice by the Lamet and Kammu to neighboring lowland Lao villages in exchange for salt and metal implements in the 1920s and 1930s but notes rice sales were declining because of competition from other producers. Since at least the 1970s, few Lao Theung produce any surplus rice. Women may sell vegetables, chickens, or occasionally handicrafts locally but do not have the important market role of lowland Lao women. Where villages have access to primary schools, both boys and girls attend for a few years, but girls are much more likely to drop out before boys.
As in all villages in Laos, village governance is managed by an elected administrative committee consisting of a president and several other members in charge of economic affairs, self-defense, agriculture, and so on. Traditionally, the village has a chief who is the intermediary between the village and the national government. Important decisions are made by elders, who in the absence of a written script memorize agreements among village members.
Both Kammu and Lamet villages have a ritual leader (lkuun in Kammu, xemia in Lamet) who officiates at important spirit rituals that affect the entire village. This position is hereditary in the male line. Kammu and Lamet, as most Lao Theung, are animists and are respected by their lowland neighbors as being especially proficient in protecting against or propitiating spirits that may cause illness or accidents. Ancestral spirits are an important aspect of household religious and safety rituals, but above the grandparents' generation they are generalized, and the spirits of specific persons are not worshiped. Kammu and Lamet revere rather than fear the spirits of their ancestors, who protect the household and village against harm as long as they are respected and are offered sacrifices. Rituals are also performed at the start of any important undertaking, for example, at the beginning of rice planting or building a house. Taboos restrict certain activities; for example, Lamet cannot make or repair tools inside the family house but do this work in the communal men's house.
Lao Theung are socially, economically, and politically the most marginal group of the three ethnic classes. During the Second Indochina War, many Lao Theung supported the Neo Lao Hak Xat (Lao Patriotic Front—LPF; see Glossary), the political party of the Pathet Lao—or actively fought with the Pathet Lao. Ethnic differences and resentments against lowland Lao dominance likely stimulated some of this support, as did effective Pathet Lao recruitment activities in the remote eastern areas populated principally by Lao Theung groups. During the years immediately after 1975, Lao Theung cadre gained numerous mid-level positions in the new government, but later many were replaced by lowland Lao with greater technical training and experience. Provincial and district officials are more likely to be Lao Theung in provinces with pronounced minority populations, and geographical isolation and poor education are still barriers to the integration of all Lao minorities in national affairs. The traditional subsistence swidden agricultural societies of the Lao Theung, which involved little trade with other groups, led to a marginal economic existence for many villages in the 1990s. Numerous individual Lao Theung have adopted lowland behavioral patterns and successfully pass as lowland Lao, but prejudicial attitudes attributed to many lowland Lao continue to affect social and economic opportunities for many Lao Theung villages.
Upland Lao society.
Lao Sung (Laotian for "the mountain top"), include six ethnic groups of which the Hmong, Akha, and Mien (Yao) are the most numerous. As of 1993, the Hmong numbered over 200,000, with settlements throughout the uplands of northern Laos. About the same number of Hmong live in northern Vietnam, and approximately 90,000 live in Thailand; this number does not include the 30,000 Hmong that were living in Thai refugee camps at the end of 1992. Some 60,000 Akha reside for the most part in Louang Namtha, Phôngsali, and Bokeo provinces. The other upland groups are the Phu Noi, found in Phôngsali and northern Louangphrabang provinces, the Mien (in Bokeo and Louang Namtha provinces), and small populations (fewer than 10,000) of Lahu and Kui located in the far northwest. The 1985 census also classified the 6,500 Hô (Haw)--Chinese originally from Yunnan Province—with the Lao Sung. All these groups have significant populations outside Laos, and the bulk of the ethnographic information available is from studies conducted in neighboring countries.
The Lao Sung are the most recent migrants to Laos, having arrived from the north in a series of migrations beginning in the early nineteenth century. Hmong entered northwestern Vietnam from China prior to 1800, and early settlements in northeastern Laos were reported around the turn of the nineteenth century. Pioneering settlements gradually extended westward, crossing the Mekong around 1890 and reaching Tak in northern Thailand around 1930. Mien migrations, in contrast, seem to have come southeast through Burma and Thailand before reaching Laos. All Lao Sung settlements are located in the north, with only Hmong villages found as far south as Vientiane.
Lao Sung typically live on mountain tops, upland ridges, or hillsides over 1,000 meters in elevation. The name means "the Lao up high." Most groups are considered to be semimigratory; villages are moved to new locations when swidden farming resources in the old locale have been exhausted. Yet some villages have continued for more than 100 years, with individual households moving in or out during this period. Although all Lao Sung traditionally live in the uplands and engage in swidden farming, their housing styles, diet, farming techniques, kinship systems, and social organization vary from one group to another.
The Hmong make up more than two-thirds of the Lao Sung. Hmong villages in Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand have traditionally been found on mountain or ridge tops, with sites selected according to principles of geomancy. Before the 1970s, villages seldom consisted of more than twenty or thirty households. Hmong rely on swidden farming to produce rice, corn, and other crops, but tend to plant a field until the soil was exhausted, rather than only for a year or two before allowing it to lie fallow. Consequently, the fields farmed by a village would gradually become too distant for easy walking, and the village would relocate to another site. The new site might be nearby or might be many kilometers distant.
The Hmong fled China (where they were traditionally paddy rice farmers) to escape persecution and pacification campaigns, gradually migrating through Vietnam and Laos, into Thailand. They adopted swidden farming in these regions by necessity because lowland basins were already settled. Small groups of households would leave an established village to start another village in relatively uninhabited upland areas. In turn, other families moving from older settlements would settle an area that had been vacated, always in search of better farmlands than those that had been left behind. As the population of both Hmong and other neighboring groups increased, it ultimately became impossible to find new unclaimed lands, and the pioneering settlement pattern ended sometime between 1960 and 1975 in western Laos and northern Thailand. Villages in the old settled areas of eastern Laos—Xiangkhoang and Louangphrabang—in many cases have been in one location for more than thirty or fifty years and have grown in size to as many as sixty or eighty households and more than 500 persons.
Hmong houses are constructed directly on the ground, with walls of vertical wooden planks and a gabled roof of thatch or split bamboo. In size they range from about five by seven meters up to ten by fifteen meters for a large extended household. The interior is divided into a kitchen/cooking alcove at one end and several sleeping alcoves at the other, with beds or sleeping benches raised thirty to forty centimeters above the dirt floor. Rice and unhusked corn are usually stored in large woven bamboo baskets inside the house, although a particularly prosperous household may build a separate granary. Furnishings are minimal: several low stools of wood or bamboo, a low table for eating, and kitchen equipment, which includes a large clay stove over which a large wok is placed for cooking ground corn, food scraps, and forest greens for the pigs. Almost every house has a simple altar mounted on one wall for offerings and ceremonies associated with ancestral spirits.
The Hmong swidden farming system is based on white (nonglutinous) rice, supplemented with corn, several kinds of tubers, and a wide variety of vegetables and squash. Rice is the preferred food, but historical evidence indicates that corn was also a major food crop in many locations and continues to be important for Hmong in Thailand in the early 1990s. Most foods are eaten boiled, and meat is only rarely part of the diet. Hmong plant many varieties of crops in different fields as a means of household risk diversification; should one crop fail, another can be counted on to take its place. Hmong also raise pigs and chickens in as large numbers as possible, and buffalo and cattle graze in the surrounding forest and abandoned fields with little care or supervision.
Hmong have traditionally grown opium in small quantities for medicinal and ritual purposes. From the beginning of their colonial presence, the need for revenue prompted the French to encourage expanded opium production for sale to the colonial monopoly and for payment as head taxes. Production, therefore, increased considerably under French rule, and by the 1930s, opium had become an important cash crop for the Hmong and some other Lao Sung groups. Hmong participate in the cash market economy somewhat more than other upland groups. They need to purchase rice or corn to supplement inadequate harvests, to buy cloth, clothing, and household goods, to save for such emergencies as illness or funerals, and to pay bride-price. In the isolated upland settlements favored by the Lao Sung, opium poppies, a cold-season crop, are typically planted in cornfields after the main harvest. Opium, a sap extracted from the poppy plant, is almost the only product that combines high value with low bulk and is nonperishable, making it easy to transport. It is thus an ideal crop, providing important insurance for the household against harvest or health crises. The government has officially outlawed opium production, but, mindful of the critical role it plays in the subsistence upland economy, has concentrated efforts on education and developing alternatives to poppy farming, rather than on stringent enforcement of the ban. It also established a special police counternarcotics unit in August 1992.
Lao Sung farming is not mechanized but depends on household labor and simple tools. The number of workers in a household thus determines how much land can be cleared and farmed each year; the time required for weeding is the main labor constraint on farm size. Corn must be weeded at least twice, and rice usually requires three weedings during the growing season. Peppers, squash, cucumbers, and beans are often interplanted with rice or corn, and separate smaller gardens for taro, arrowroot, cabbage, and so on may be found adjacent to the swiddens or in the village. In long- established villages, fruit trees such as pears and peaches are planted around the houses.
In response to increasing population pressure in the uplands, as well as to government discouragement of swidden farming, some Hmong households or villages are in the process of developing small rice paddies in narrow upland valleys or relocating to lower elevations where, after two centuries as swidden farmers, they are learning paddy technology, how to train draft buffalo, and how to identify seed varieties. This same process is also occurring with other Lao Sung groups to varying degrees in the early 1990s as it had under the RLG.
Hmong households traditionally consist of large patrilineal extended families, with the parents, children, and wives and children of married sons all living under the same roof. Households of over twenty persons are not uncommon, although ten to twelve persons are more likely. Older sons, however, may establish separate households with their wives and children after achieving economic independence. By the 1990s, a tendency had developed in Laos for households to be smaller and for each son and his wife to establish a separate household when the next son married. Thus, the household tends toward a stem family pattern consisting of parents and unmarried children, plus perhaps one married son. Following this pattern, the youngest son and his wife frequently inherit the parental house; gifts of silver and cattle are made to the other sons at marriage or when they establish a separate residence. In many cases, the new house is physically quite close to the parents' house.
Hmong reckon kinship patrilineally and identify fifteen or sixteen patrilineal exogamous clans, each tracing their descent back to a common mythical ancestor. There are several subdivisions in Hmong society, usually named according to features of traditional dress. The White Hmong, Striped Hmong, and Green Hmong (sometimes called Blue Hmong) are the most numerous. Their languages are somewhat different but mutually comprehensible, and all recognize the same clans. Each village usually has at least two clans represented, although one may be more numerous. Wives almost always live with their husband's family.
Marriage is traditionally arranged by go-betweens who represent the boy's family to the girl's parents. If the union is acceptable, a bride-price is negotiated, typically ranging from three to ten silver bars, worth about US$100 each, a partial artifact from the opium trade. The wedding takes place in two installments, first at the bride's house, followed by a procession to the groom's house where a second ceremony occurs. Sometimes the young man arranges with his friends to "steal" a bride; the young men persuade the girl to come out of her house late at night and abduct her to the house of her suitor. Confronted by the fait accompli, the girl's parents usually accept a considerably lower bride-price than might otherwise be demanded. Although some bride stealing undoubtedly involves actual abductions, it more frequently occurs with the connivance of the girl and is a form of elopement.
As a result of a government directive discouraging excessive expenditures on weddings, some districts with substantial Hmong populations decided in the early 1980s to abolish the institution of bride-price, which had already been administratively limited by the government to between one and three silver bars. In addition, most marriages reportedly occurred by "wife stealing" or elopement, rather than by arrangement. In the past, males had to wait for marriage until they had saved an adequate sum for the bride-price, occasionally until their mid-twenties; with its abolition, they seemed to be marrying earlier. Hmong women typically marry between fourteen and eighteen years of age.
The Hmong practice polygyny, although the government officially discourages the custom. Given the regular need for labor in the swidden fields, an additional wife and children can improve the fortunes of a family by changing the consumer/worker balance in the household and facilitating expansion of cropped areas, particularly the labor-intensive opium crop. Yet the need to pay bride-price limits the numbers of men who can afford a second (or third) wife. Anthropological reports for Hmong in Thailand and Laos in the 1970s suggested that between 20 and 30 percent of marriages were polygynous. However, more recent studies since the mid-1980s indicate a lower rate not exceeding 10 percent of all households. Divorce is possible but discouraged. In the case of marital conflict, elders of the two clans attempt to reconcile the husband and wife, and a hearing is convened before the village headman. If reconciliation is not possible, the wife may return to her family. Disposition of the bride-price and custody of the children depend largely on the circumstances of the divorce and which party initiates the separation.
Hmong gender roles are strongly differentiated. Women are responsible for all household chores, including cooking, grinding corn, husking rice, and child care, in addition to regular farming tasks. Patrilocal residence and strong deference expected toward men and elders of either sex often make the role of daughter-in-law a difficult one. Under the direction of her mother-in-law, the young bride is commonly expected to carry out many of the general household tasks. This subordinate role may be a source of considerable hardship and tension. Farm tasks are the responsibility of both men and women, with some specialization by gender. Only men fell trees in the swidden clearing operation, although both sexes clear the grass and smaller brush; only men are involved in the burning operation. During planting, men punch the holes followed by the women who place and cover the seeds. Both men and women are involved in the weeding process, but it appears that women do more of this task, as well as carry more than half of the harvested grain from the fields to the village. Harvesting and threshing are shared. Women primarily care for such small animals as chickens and pigs, while men are in charge of buffalo, oxen, and horses. Except for the rare household with some paddy fields, the buffalo are not trained but simply turned out to forage most of the year.
As with all Laotian ethnic groups, there is virtually no occupational specialization in Hmong villages. Everyone is first and foremost a subsistence farmer, although some people may have additional specialized skills or social roles.
Hmong are animists, although a small number have converted to Christianity as a result of contact with Protestant and Roman Catholic missionaries. Most believe that spirits are a common cause for illness. Shamans (txiv neeb) who can treat spirit- induced illness are respected and play an important role in the village, often being consulted to tell fortunes. Shamans may be either male or female and are usually "chosen" by the spirits after the former have suffered a long illness. Other men and women may know curing rites but do not enter a trance as a shaman does.
Village stratification is limited but based primarily on clan membership and wealth. Often the clan that founded a village dominates it, either because of numerical majority or because early settlement facilitated access to the better fields. A family's wealth derives primarily from work and good luck. The ability to produce enough rice, or even a little to sell, and a decent opium harvest depend on having enough workers in the family to clear and care for more extensive swidden fields than average. Livestock, particularly buffalo and cattle, are another important source of mobile wealth. This wealth, however, is subject to loss through disease, just as savings of silver, livestock, or cash can be lost almost overnight if the family experiences a serious illness that reduces the workforce at a critical time or that requires the sacrifice of chickens, pigs, or even a buffalo for curing rituals. Proceeds from sales of opium and livestock not immediately consumed are usually converted into silver bars or jewelry for safekeeping.
In contrast to the Buddhist wat or the men's common house in Lao Loum, Kammu, and Lamet villages, there is no building or other central point in a Hmong village. Hmong cultural norms are more individualistic, and the household is more important than the village. Despite greater overall village permanence than in former times, individual households may come and go, usually in search of better opportunities but occasionally because of conflict with relatives or neighbors. The decline of migrating villages has been a gradual process since the 1940s. As opportunities for pioneering settlements have disappeared, households often relocate to be near other clan members or less-distant relatives.
Village governance is usually in the hands of a president and administrative committee, but clan elders have important consultative or advisory roles in all decisions. Interhousehold cooperative relationships occur less often than among the Lao Loum and appear limited to labor exchanges for some farming tasks and assistance at house raisings. Most cooperation takes place among brothers or cousins, and it is primarily close kin who can be relied upon for assistance in the case of family hardship or emergency. Lacking any other resource, Hmong will look for help from any other member of the same clan.
Hmong and other Lao Sung groups have traditionally lived in villages distant from Lao Loum or Lao Theung settlements, although trade in rice, forest products, and other market goods has stimulated contact between the groups. As the population of both Lao Sung and Lao Loum groups increased after the war, Lao Sung expansion of swidden fields had an impact on the watersheds of Lao Loum rice paddies. Northern Lao Loum who cannot produce enough rice on limited paddy fields have also begun to clear swiddens in the middle elevations. For the most part, there has been no overt conflict, and trade and casual contact have continued, but long- standing ethnic prejudice continued to color interethnic relations in these regions of closer contact and competition for land in the early 1990s.
At the same time that roads in remote provinces were being improved and international trade opened in the late 1980s, the Thai government imposed a ban on logging and timber exports following extensive deforestation and catastrophic floods. Thai logging companies quickly turned to Laos as an alternate source of tropical hardwoods. This suddenly increased demand for tropical timber has stimulated additional competition for hitherto unvalued forestland and provoked increased criticism of upland swidden farming groups. Although traditional levels of swidden farming did not cause the same level of land and forest damage as have recent logging activities, government statements increasingly have attributed rapid deforestation to swidden clearing and have envisioned the abolition of all upland swidden cultivation soon after the year 2000. Thus, in the 1990s, there may be more pressure on arable land in the uplands than previously. However, other analysts have noted the great impact of legal and illegal logging, as well as the encroachment of lowland Lao farmers into the uplands since the end of the Second Indochina War. A continuing low-level insurgency against the government, substantially led by Hmong refugees who formerly fought for the RLG, is a further source of official mistrust directed at some Hmong and other minority groups. Government efforts to resettle Hmong and other swidden farming communities in lowland sites are motivated by security concerns—as was the case under the RLG in the 1960s and 1970s—and by competition for timber, but may lead to increased disaffection of the minorities affected.
The pattern of rural life.
For Lao Loum, Lao Theung, and Lao Sung, the rhythm of life is strongly tied to the changing seasons and the requirements of farming. For swidden farming villages, the work year begins in January or February when new fields are cleared. This time of the year is also good for hunting and for moving to a new village. Opium farmers harvest the resin between January and March, depending on location and variety of poppy, but otherwise there are few agricultural activities. Swidden fields are burned around March and must be planted in May or June, just before the first rains. From the time the seeds sprout until August, work revolves around the never-ending task of weeding. Hunting and fishing continue, and with the coming of the rains, the forest begins to yield new varieties of wild foods.
For paddy farmers, the agricultural year begins with the first rains, when a small seedbed is plowed and planted. The seedlings grow for a month or so while the remaining fields are plowed and harrowed in preparation for transplanting. Transplanting requires steady work from every able-bodied person over a period of about a month and is one of the main periods of labor exchange in lowland villages.
Swidden farmers begin the corn harvest as early as September, and short-season rice varieties mature soon after the corn. Paddy rice seldom ripens before October, however, and the harvest may continue through early December in some areas, although midNovember is more usual. Even late swidden rice is finished by early November. Harvesting and threshing the rice are the principal activities during the second period of intense work in the farm year. Dry-season rice farmers repeat the same cycle, but vegetables, tobacco, or other cash crops require a more even labor input over the season.
Food availability parallels the seasons. Wild foods and fish are abundant during the rainy season, although the months just before the corn ripens may be difficult if the previous year's harvest was inadequate. Fruit is available during the rainy and cool dry seasons, but becomes scarce, as do most vegetables, from March through May. Hmong and Mien celebrate their new year in December or January, when the harvest is complete but before the time to clear new fields. Lowland Lao celebrate their new year on 15 April also shortly before the start of the farming year. The harvest is marked by the That Luang festival, on the full moon of the twelfth lunar month, which falls in late November or early December.
Because most roads are in poor condition, travel in the rainy season is generally difficult, and villagers tend to stay close to home, because of farmwork as well as the ever-present mud. The dry season brings easier land travel and the free time it allows. Since the late 1980s, a few rural villagers have begun to travel to regional population centers in search of temporary wage employment, often in construction.
Urban society.
With a population of somewhat over 250,000 in 1985, Vientiane is the only city of any size in Laos. Three provincial capitals have populations of more than 20,000—Louangphrabang with 20,000, Savannakhét with 109,000, and Pakxé with 50,000. The 1985 census classified 15 percent of the population as "urbanized," but this figure includes the populations of all district centers, most of which are little more than large villages of 2,000 to 3,000 persons. The expanded marketing and commercial opportunities resulting from economic liberalization in 1986 have somewhat stimulated urban growth. Vientiane planners anticipate an annual population expansion of 5.4 percent through the year 2000, and many of the more rural provincial capitals also are growing at a significant rate in the early 1990s.
Urban centers, for the most part, have developed from villages that expanded or grew together around an administrative or trading center. Louangphrabang is the historical capital of the kingdom of Lan Xang, and Vientiane and Pakxé are also centers of earlier kingdoms. Migration of the Lao Loum into the region resulted in the establishment of muang, semi-independent principalities, which sometimes formed a larger state entity but which always preserved a certain autonomy as a result of transportation and communication difficulties. Many of the original districts, have since become district centers, and the word itself is used for this political division. Although district centers rarely had more than a few thousand people as the mid-1990s approached, they serve as secondary administrative posts and marketing centers for the surrounding villages and are the location of the medical clinic and lowersecondary school—grades six through eight—for the vast majority of the rural population.
Population displacement during the Second Indochina War caused growth in some cities—Vientiane, Louangphrabang, and the main lower Mekong Valley towns—but depopulation of centers in the eastern liberated zones. Xiangkhoang was destroyed by bombing in 1969, and Xam Nua and Phôngsali were virtually depopulated. These provincial capitals have been revived since 1975, but their geographic isolation inhibits rapid growth. The capital of Xiangkhoang was relocated twenty kilometers north to the village of Phônsavan. Administrative centers of several districts were also relocated after 1975 in order to make them more central to all villages in the district.
Historically, towns were located along major rivers or in upland valleys and were primarily populated by Lao Loum and small populations of Vietnamese merchants, artisans, and civil servants (imported by the French), as well as by Chinese and Indian traders. Migration of refugees during the Second Indochina War brought an increased minority population, which grew even faster after 1975 because officials of the new regime, many of whom were Lao Theung and Lao Sung, moved into administrative posts in Mekong towns. So many Chinese and Indian merchants left Laos during the war that these groups accounted for only a small portion of the urban population in 1994. Many Vietnamese who were sympathetic to the RLG also fled, although an unknown number of advisers from North Vietnam were posted to Vientiane and other major centers. The Vietnamese population was nevertheless unlikely to exceed a few thousand in any towns other than Vientiane and Savannakhét.
All provincial capitals were centers of marketing, administration, education, and health care, but not of manufacturing because there was virtually no industrial production outside the Vientiane area. As of mid-1994, each capital had at least one upper-secondary school—often the only one in the province—along with specialized technical schools for agriculture, teacher training, or public health. Almost every province capital also had a hospital, but the quality of care and the availability of medicines—although greater than that in villages—were frequently limited.
Everywhere, the basic village character of society is evident. Even in Vientiane, a substantial number of the inhabitants are paddy rice farmers, either as their main occupation or as important supplemental work. Government officials' salaries are inadequate to support a family, and many officials rely on family members to secure their basic rice supply by farming. Cities and towns are also important markets for vegetables and fruit produced in the nearby villages; the trade volume remains small outside of Vientiane but has stimulated the gradually increasing market orientation of rural producers.
Traditional festivals and religious ceremonies are observed in towns much as in villages and are often organized on the basis of a neighborhood, which is typically defined by the boundaries of a formerly separate village. Family life-cycle ceremonies frequently draw guests from outside the neighborhood but rely on close neighbors and relatives to help with food and other preparations, as in a village.
Between 1975 and 1990, urban amenities such as hotels, restaurants, and cinemas were virtually absent outside of Vientiane, Savannakhét, and Louangphrabang. A few towns had government-operated guest houses for official travelers and one or two restaurants with a limited menu. Travelers in most district centers and even some provincial capitals could find a meal only by making arrangements with a family or the caretaker assigned to the guest house. Town markets are also limited in size and number. After the economic reforms of the late 1980s, however, private restaurants and hotels opened in most provincial centers and larger districts. Official travel increased, and more important, Laotian merchants, foreign delegations, and tourists again began to travel within the country.
Sanitation services and utilities are not widespread. As of mid-1994, only a few of the larger towns had municipal water systems, and none had sewerage services. Electrification is a limited but important feature of urban life. Outside of the Vientiane area, Thakhek, Louangphrabang, and Savannakhét, most district centers did not have electricity in the early 1990s. Even in towns, electric power is limited to a few hours a day. Automobile batteries and voltage inverters are widely used as a power source to watch television or listen to a stereo cassette player.
The presence of a foreign diplomatic and aid community has had a significant effect on the economy of Vientiane, both in terms of direct aid and through employment of Laotians by the missions and as domestic help. In response, Vientiane merchants stock imported consumer goods such as electronics, clothing, and food, items purchased by Laotians much more than by foreigners. A once dormant service sector of automobile and truck repair, tailors, barbers, and hairdressers has begun to revive. Patrons at restaurants and the six disco establishments are also predominantly Laotians, reflecting the increased income available to private-sector businessmen and employees of foreign organizations. Foreign assistance in Vientiane during the early years of the LPDR helped to develop several upper-secondary schools and technical-training schools and improve the two main hospitals.
However, Laotian cities failed to attract the rural population, as cities do in other countries, because they offer little obvious economic opportunity and because the rural areas offer the possibility of making a decent living within communities that had not been socially or economically fragmented by the forces of modernization. Further, the government initially had explicitly anti-urban policies. Other towns had experienced less in-migration than Vientiane; this pattern is likely to change if economic opportunities arise in secondary towns or if competition for land and forest resources—or restrictions on access—increase to the point of reducing the rural standard of living. Nevertheless, even if a town does not dominate the region, it has an impact on the lives of people living in the surrounding area. The larger the population of a town, the greater the town's impact on the region. For example, farmers within about fifteen kilometers of Louangphrabang grow vegetables for sale in the town market. In Vientiane, this radius expands to forty kilometers; some village residents commute up to thirty kilometers each way to government or private jobs in the capital. Through these contacts, new ideas and material goods filter into rural areas.

Velachery aeri

Velachery aeri (), or Velachery lake, is one of the lakes inside Chennai, in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, with a good stock of water all through the year. Since Velachery is a low lying area, the monsoon rain water from the neighbouring areas are drained into this lake.
CHENNAI: In an unexpected turn of events, the Chennai Corporation has decided to put on hold the proposal for boat rides and other tourist facilities on the Velachery lake, one of the few water bodies still alive in the city. The reason it has cited is the high level of contamination of the water.
"The water is totally contaminated and not conducive for boating. At present, stormwater drain works are in progress near the lake, which we hope will put an end to illegal discharge of sewage from residential areas. It could be dangerous for children to go on a boat ride on the contaminated waterbody," corporation commissioner D Karthikeyan told TOI.
The ambitious programme of the corporation was conceived three years ago. The local body had even engaged a consultant, shortlisted by experts from Anna University, Public Works Department and the agriculture department. The consultant gave a detailed plan in October last on how to beautify the lake. This included removal of encroachments in Gandhi Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar, fencing of the entire waterbody, provision of three decks for walking, viewing and fishing and a boating jetty. The consultant also suggested plantation of African grass, reed and bamboo along the middle deck and flowering plants and trees like bottlebrush, bougainvillea, royal palms and areca nut betel palms along the upper deck.
Poor upkeep of the lake has been a subject of discussion for years now, as locals vent their anger against government agencies. "It is sheer neglect on part of the government that has led to the degradation of the lake. It breached at six places a few years ago due to poor maintenance. Plenty of representations were made to the departments concerned to maintain the lake, but in vain," said A Ramasamy of Federation of Velachery Welfare Associations and a resident of Lakshmi Hayagriva Nagar.
Had the lake been properly maintained, it could have been a major source of drinking water. The rapid pace of real estate development in the last two decades resulted in the shrinking of the waterbody from 265 acres to 55 acres now. The government allocated 53 acres to the Tamil Nadu Housing Board and 34 acres to the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board for housing development. The encroachers on Erikkarai Street in Gandhi Nagar, who don't have sewage connections, are contributing to the pollution of the lake, locals said.
There are about 2,000 families living in the southern bund. Even though some have toilets in the backyard, they conveniently direct the pipelines to the lake, causing extensive damage to the waterbody. The government's efforts to relocate the encroachers has not yielded satisfactory results. Corporation officials said they were trying to convince encroachers to get sewer connections by paying a nominal fee of Rs 100. "That is the least we can do," said a senior official.

Jamal Idris

Jamal Dasuki Idris (born 6 July 1990) is an Australian professional rugby league footballer for the Penrith Panthers of the National Rugby League. An Australia national and New South Wales State of Origin representative centre, he previously played for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, and has also played for the Indigenous Australian representative side. 
Background.
The son of an Aboriginal mother and a Nigerian father, Idris spent two years growing up in an Aboriginal mission in Forster on the New South Wales Mid North Coast with his younger brother, Isaac, and mother, Alana. The family moved to Sydney, where Idris now lives, because of Jamal's interest in athletics, especially javelin throwing . Following several representative seasons in athletics, Idris took up rugby league in high school. His junior clubs were Chester Hill Hornets, Merrylands Rams, Fairfield Patrician Brothers, Bankstown Sports, Guildford Raiders, Berala Bears and Forster Tuncurry Hawkes.
Due to his physical size (199 cm height, 115 kg weight), his looks and his dreadlocked hairstyle, Idris has been confused for Lote Tuqiri by even his own family.
Professional playing career.
Bulldogs.
Idris atteneded Chester Hill North Public School
Idris graduated from LaSalle Catholic College, Bankstown at the end of 2008. 
In March 2009, Idris was involved in a fight with Bulldogs teammates and was suspended for one week. In May of the same year, Idris had what seemed to be the match-winning try against the St. George Illawarra Dragons denied after it was deemed that Greg Eastwood had obstructed Dragons' five-eighth Jamie Soward on the halfway line where Idris made the line break. The Bulldogs lost this game 20-18.
His performance early in the 2009 season prompted dual international Wendell Sailor to say: "What Jamal's doing at the moment, I think it's a lot better than what Izzy (Israel Folau) was doing at the same age." On 8 September, Idris was Named Dally M Rookie of the Year.
The 2010 NRL Season began slowly for Idris, but he soon found his true potential. He scored two tries in the Bulldogs 60-14 win over the Sydney Roosters, and a month later had a man of the match performance against the Brisbane Broncos. He backed that up with an entertaining clash with Timana Tahu when the Bulldogs played the Eels. He was rewarded with a place in the Country Origin team. After a strong performance for Country, including a try, Idris was named on the bench for the New South Wales State of Origin team for Game I of the 2010 State of Origin series.
He played the 2nd half of Game I of the 2010 State of Origin series, scoring a try in a loss. Idris was dropped for the second match but was named the 18th man. In 2010, Jamal was named in the training side for Australia in the Four Nations tournament.
In September, 2010 Idris was allegedly struck on the neck with a sword by a cousin while visiting Forster. His cousin, Beau Currie, 20, apparently plead guilty to the attack two days after it happened and was sentenced to 18 months in jail with a non-parole period of 14 months. At the beginning of the 2011 season Jamal has played well for Canterbury. Jamal has been offered what he says are two offers from two clubs, the Newcastle Knights and the Gold Coast Titans. On 12 April 2011 Jamal signed with The Gold Coast Titans
Jamal made the Australian team in 2011, he debuted on 6 May 2011 against New Zealand. Later that year it was announced that Idris had signed with the Gold Coast Titans starting from the 2012 NRL season.
Titans.
In the 2012 season opener against the North Queensland Cowboys, Idris scored the opening try for the Titans for the season and put a big hit on Glenn Hall in the 26th minute. Due to form and injury, Idris saw one of his less effective seasons to date. After consecutive years of making representative football, Idris was yet to see a representative jumper in 2012. At the end of the 2013 season Idris had been in talks with the Panthers as he sought a return to Sydney on compassionate grounds to be closer to his family. On 7 January 2013 it was reported that the Panthers had signed him.
Panthers.
Before the start of the 2014 NRL season, the Penrith Panthers signed Idris on a three-year deal. In a return deal, the Panthers released Brad Tighe from the final two years of his contract to join the Titans.

Healthcare in Laos was poor in the early 1990s. Although diets are not grossly inadequate, chronic moderate vitamin and protein deficiencies are common, particularly among upland ethnic groups. Poor sanitation and the prevalence of several tropical diseases further eroded the health of the population. Western medical care is available in few locations, and the quality and experience of practitioners are, for the most part, marginal, a situation that has not improved much since the 1950s.
Life expectancy.
The life expectancy at birth for men and women in Laos was estimated in 1988 at forty-nine years, the same as in Cambodia but at least ten years lower than in any other Southeast Asian nation. High child and infant mortality rates strongly affected this figure, with the Ministry of Public Health estimating the infant mortality rate at 109 per 1,000 and the under-five mortality rate at 180 per 1,000 in 1988. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF—see Glossary) believed these figures underestimated the true mortality rate but still represented decreases from comparable rates in 1960. Regional differences were great. Whereas the infant mortality rate for Vientiane was about 50 per 1,000, in some remote rural areas it was estimated to be as high as 350 per 1,000 live births; that is, 35 percent of all children died before the age of one.
Children's deaths are primarily due to communicable diseases, with malaria, acute respiratory infections, and diarrhea the main causes of mortality as well as morbidity. Vaccination against childhood diseases was expanding, but in 1989 Vientiane's municipal authorities still were unable to vaccinate more than 50 percent of targeted children. Other provinces have much lower rates of immunization. Malaria is widespread among both adults and children, with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum involved in 80 to 90 percent of the cases.
In the first malaria eradication program between 1956–60, DDT was sprayed over much of the country. Since 1975 the government has steadily increased its activities to eradicate malaria. The Ministry of Public Health operates provincial stations to monitor and combat malaria through diagnosis and treatment. Prevention measures involve chemical prophylaxis to high-risk groups, elimination of mosquito breeding sites, and promotion of individual protection. The campaign has had some success: the ministry reported a decline in the infected population from 26 percent to 15 percent between 1975 and 1990.
As of 1993, diarrheal diseases were also common, with regular outbreaks occurring annually at the beginning of the rainy season when drinking water is contaminated by human and animal wastes washing down hillsides. Only a few rural households have pit or water seal toilets, and people commonly relieve themselves in the brush or forested areas surrounding each village. For children in these villages, many of whom are chronically undernourished, acute or chronic diarrhea is life-threatening because it results in dehydration and can precipitate severe malnutrition.
Although nutrition appears to be marginal in the general population, health surveys are of varying quality. Some data indicate that stunting—low height for age—in the under-five population ranged from 2 to 35 percent, while wasting—low weight for height—probably does not exceed 10 percent of the under-five population. These figures reflect village diets based predominantly on rice, with vegetables as a common accompaniment and animal protein—fish, chicken, and wild foods—eaten irregularly. Children aged six months to two years—the weaning period—are particularly susceptible to undernutrition. The nutritional status of adults is related closely to what is being grown on the family farm, as well as to dietary habits. For example, fresh vegetables and fruits are not highly valued and therefore are not consumed in adequate amounts. As a result, it is likely that vitamin A, iron, and calcium deficiencies are common in all parts of the country.
Common Infection and safety.
As Western and European medical industries reported so much, the environment in Laos has infectious issues even now. The government state newspaper "Vientiane times" tells that Laos government launch improvement plans of water and foods quality. The travel guide "Lonely Planet" also describes this social reality in their books. However, it is not definitely found in the Laos tourism market materials. 
Laos is also the place where Thais leak dumped products which failed the quality test for finished foods and deal with it there. Even though Barack Obama released Laos from economic blacklist, this situations are being left on the whole Laos areas.
HIV/AIDS.
Permissive attitudes of Laotian men toward sex and prostitution facilitated the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during the 1980s and 1990s, making HIV infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) a growing concern. In 1992 a focused sample of about 7,600 urban residents identified one AIDS case and fourteen persons who tested HIV positive. No other statistics were available as of mid-1994.
Maternal and Child Health Care.
In June 2011, the United Nations Population Fund released a report on The State of the World's Midwifery. It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Lao People's Democratic Republic is 580. This is compared with 339.2 in 2008 and 1215.4 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 61 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 38. The aim of this report is to highlight ways in which the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved, particularly Goal 4 – Reduce child mortality and Goal 5 – improve maternal death. In Lao People's Democratic Republic the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 2 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 49. 
Health Infrastructure.
Despite government promises that the urban-oriented health system inherited from the RLG would be expanded to support rural primary health care and preventative programs, little money had been allocated to the health sector as of 1993. According to figures from 1988, less than 5 percent of the total government budget was targeted for health, with the result that the Ministry of Public Health was unable to establish a management and planning system to facilitate the changes envisioned. UNICEF considered the effort to construct a primary health care system to have failed entirely.
Official statistics identified hospitals in fifteen of the sixteen provinces, plus several in Vientiane, and clinics in 110 districts and more than 1,000 tasseng (subdistricts—see Glossary). In reality, most subdistrict clinics are unstaffed, unequipped, and unsupplied, and in 1989 only twenty of the district clinics actually provided services. The physical condition of the facilities is poor, with clean water and latrines unavailable at most health posts, and electricity unavailable at 85 percent of district clinics, rendering vaccine storage impossible. Drugs and equipment stored in the central warehouses are seldom distributed to outlying provinces, and in most situations, patients had to purchase Western pharmaceuticals from private pharmacies that imported stock from Thailand or Vietnam.
The number of health care personnel has been increasing since 1975, and in 1990 the ministry reported 1,095 physicians, 3,313 medical assistants, and 8,143 nurses. Most personnel are concentrated in the Vientiane area, where the population per physician ratio (1,400 to one) is more than ten times higher than in the provinces. In 1989 the national ratio was 2.6 physicians per 10,000 persons.
Training medical personnel at all levels emphasizes theory at the expense of practical skills and relies on curricula similar to those used prior to 1975. International foreign aid donors supported plans for a school of public health, and texts were written and published in Lao. As of 1990, however, the school did not exist, because of delays in approval of its structure and difficulties in finding trainers with the appropriate background.
Rural and provincial health personnel work under conditions similar to their counterparts in education: salaries are low and seldom paid on time, necessary equipment and supplies are unavailable, and superiors offer little supervision or encouragement. In these circumstances, morale is low, job attendance sporadic, and most health care ineffectual. In general, the population has little confidence in the health care sector, although some village medics and a few district or provincial hospitals are respected by their communities.
Use of traditional medical practitioners remains important in urban as well as rural locations. Healers who know how to use medicinal plants are often consulted for common illnesses. The Institute of Traditional Medicine of the Ministry of Public Health formulated and marketed a number of preparations from medicinal plants. Spirit healers are also important for many groups, in some cases using medicinal plants but often relying on rituals to identify a disease and effect a cure. Many Laotians found no contradiction in consulting both spirit curers and Western-trained medical personnel.
In the absence of a widespread system of health workers, local shops selling drugs became an important source of medicines and offered advice on prescriptions. However, these pharmacies are unregulated and their owners unlicensed. As a consequence, misprescription is common, both of inappropriate drugs and incorrect dosages. In rural areas, vendors commonly make up small packets of drugs—typically including an antibiotic, several vitamins, and a fever suppressant—and sell them as single-dose cures for a variety of ailments.

HIV/AIDS in Laos

Prevalence.
The Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) currently faces a concentrated epidemic with an adult HIV prevalence of 0.1 percent. Since the first case was identified in 1990, the number of infections has continued to grow. In 2005, UNAIDS estimated that 3,700 people in Lao PDR were living with HIV.
Lao PDR’s low HIV prevalence does not necessarily indicate low risk. Moreover, the HIV-prevalence rate is increasing. Because of its geographical location in the heart of the Mekong region, injecting drug use, and unsafe sexual practices, Lao PDR is in danger of an expanded epidemic. Nearly 5 percent of injecting drug users (IDUs) were found to be HIV-positive in 2005. Although only 0 to 1.1 percent of sex workers were HIV-infected in 2000, a 2004 survey of the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among service women found that chlamydia/gonorrhea prevalence was 45 percent in the capital Vientiane, 43.6 percent in the border province of Bokeo, and 27.9 percent in the southern province of Champasak, indicating the vulnerability of these women to HIV.
Lao PDR is undergoing rapid socioeconomic changes, including increased international tourism, leading to sexual behaviors that may place some Laotians at increased risk for HIV infection. For instance, a report cited by UNAIDS found increasing sexual activity among young men in Vientiane in 2004, nearly 60 percent of whom reported having multiple partners in the first six months of the year and more than one-third of whom reported paying for sex. Many of Lao PDR’s men who have sex with men (MSM) also report having sex with women. Women are considered to be particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS because of their low literacy, education and health status. Women whose husbands have multiple sex partners and visit sex workers are particularly vulnerable.
Compounding Lao PDR’s vulnerability to an expanding HIV epidemic is a low level of knowledge about the disease among the general population. According to one study reported in the World Bank-sponsored Lao PDR Gender Profile, 23 percent of respondents did not know that HIV was transmissible by blood, and more than half did not know that it could be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Implementing programs to increase knowledge and awareness is difficult in Lao PDR because the country is home to 47 different ethnic groups with multiple native languages and a variety of cultures.
According to the World Health Organization, Lao PDR had 69 new tuberculosis (TB) cases per 100,000 people in 2005, one of the highest incidence rates in the region. Although HIV-TB co-infection is relatively low, with only 0.7 percent of new TB cases occurring among HIV-infected individuals, the country is in danger of a combined epidemic. HIV-TB co-infection poses a challenge to providing treatment and care for both diseases.
National Response.
The Lao PDR government initiated its response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 1992, when participants at an AIDS conference agreed that the spread of HIV was inevitable and would likely occur via young male urban or international migrants who returned to their villages and via women who became commercial sex workers out of economic necessity. The National Committee for the Control of AIDS is in charge of policy matters related to HIV/AIDS prevention and control. The committee consists of 14 members from 12 government ministries. The National Action Plan on HIV/AIDS/STIs for 2006–2010 focuses on achieving universal access to treatment, care and support.
The National Socioeconomic Development Plan for 2006–2010 addresses HIV/AIDS, indicating the government’s commitment to expanding the national response. Since implementing the plan, national authorities have worked to target people most likely to be exposed to the disease; scale up prevention, treatment, care and support; and improve strategic information. Activities to fight HIV/AIDS, including Behavior Change Communication (BCC) interventions, peer education, life skills training, and a 100 percent condom use program, have been integrated into Lao PDR’s general development programs. The Ministry of Education is promoting HIV/AIDS and sex education by training school principals and teachers in these areas, so they can transfer their knowledge to students. The objective is to reduce risky sexual behavior to help keep down the number of new HIV infections in the country. According to UNAIDS, as of 2005, 49 percent of HIV-infected women and men were receiving antiretroviral therapy.
Lao PDR receives support in its response to HIV/AIDS from various international donors, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Global Fund approved a sixth-round grant from Lao PDR to scale up HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment in 2006.

Fishing in Laos

For many Laotians, freshwater fish are the principal source of protein; per capita consumption averages 5.1 kilograms annually. Fishpond culture had begun in the mid-1960s, and production—mainly carp raised in small home lots—grew an average 30 percent annually thereafter, the highest rate in Asia between 1975 and 1985. The Mekong districts in the south have especially high potential for greater increases in fish production. In the 1982-84 period, the average annual catch was 20,000 tons, all of which was consumed domestically.

Sounds of Christmas

Sounds of Christmas is the 21st album released by the vocalist Johnny Mathis. It was his 17th original studio album with four compilations of hit singles having been released by the singer to this point. It was his second Christmas album, originally released on Mercury Records in 1963.
Overview.
After a highly successful career as a recording artist with Columbia Records from 1956 to 1963, Mathis moved to Mercury Records for which he recorded exclusively from 1963 to 1967, releasing ten studio albums and thirteen singles. The change was motivated by a desire for greater control over his recordings including owning the masters. This album was the first to be recorded and released by the singer for Mercury.
As with Mathis' final studio albums for Columbia, Don Costa provided the album's musical direction. The album works well as a sequel to his previous Christmas collection, "Merry Christmas", as it also seamlessly blends traditional Christmas carols ("God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen") with classical musical ("Hallelujah Chorus") and popular Christmas songs ("Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and "Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer").
In 1971, Columbia Records reissued the album as Christmas with Johnny Mathis on its budget Harmony Records imprint, with different cover art and omitting two songs ("The Little Drummer Boy" and "Have Reindeer, Will Travel") from the original track list. This incarnation of the album was later reissued on compact disc.
"Billboard" album chart.
Continuing his run of highly successful albums, on its original release this album peaked at #2 on the "Billboard" album chart, his twentieth consecutive album to chart.
Johnny Mathis Christmas albums.
In the spoken patter at the outset of the Mathis/Bette Midler duet "Winter Wonderland/Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!" from Midler's 2006 holiday album "Cool Yule", Midler is heard describing Mathis as "the king of Christmas", a fitting title given his many holiday albums. In 2013, Mathis released his sixth original Christmas album. The six are:

Forestry in Laos

In the 1950s, forests covered 70 percent of the land area in Laos; yet, by 1992, according to government estimates, forest coverage had decreased by nearly one-third, to just 47 percent of total land area. Despite the dwindling expanse, timber—including ironwood, mahogany, pine, redwood, and teak—and other forestry products—benzoin (resin), charcoal, and sticklac—constitute a valuable supply of potential export goods. The forest has also been an important source of wild foods, herbal medicines, and timber for house construction and even into the 1990s continues to be a valued reserve of natural products for noncommercial household consumption. Since the mid-1980s, however, widespread commercial harvesting of timber for the export market has disrupted the traditional gathering of forest products in a number of locations and contributed to extremely rapid deforestation throughout the country.
Deforestation increased steadily throughout the 1980s, at an annual average rate of about 1.2 percent in the first half of the decade according to the United Nations (UN) and other monitoring agencies. This rate represents the destruction of about 150,000 to 160,000 hectares annually, as compared with annual reforestation of about 2,000 hectares. The government, however, reported a deforestation rate double this figure. Deforestation results from clearing forestland for shifting cultivation and removing logs for industrial uses and fuel. The volume of logs (roundwood) removed for industrial purposes increased by about 70 percent between 1975–77 and 1985–87, to about 330,000 cubic meters; however, this volume was dwarfed by that removed for domestic (fuel) purposes. Between 1980 and 1989, the volume of logs removed for fuel increased by about 25 percent, to about 3.7 million cubic meters; only about 100,000 cubic meters were removed for industrial purposes. By 1991 these figures had increased to approximately 3.9 million cubic meters and 106,000 cubic meters, respectively.
Following the introduction of the New Economic Mechanism, decentralization of forest management to autonomous forest enterprises at the provincial level encouraged increased exploitation of forests. At the central and provincial levels, autonomous forest enterprises are responsible for forest management.
Timber resources have been commercially exploited on a small scale since the colonial period and are an important source of foreign exchange. In 1988 wood products accounted for more than one-half of all export earnings. In 1992 timber and wood products were almost one-third of the total principal exports.
The government needed to reconcile its opposing objectives of decentralized forestry management and environmental protection. In January 1989, the government imposed a ban on logging--initially announced in January 1988 as a ban on the export of unprocessed wood—although exemptions are granted on a case-by-case basis. This measure was followed by the imposition of high export taxes on timber and other wood products, included in the June 1989 tax reforms. Toward the end of 1989, logging was again permitted, but only based on quotas extended to individual forestry enterprises. In response to the restrictions, production of unprocessed logs (roundwood or timber) decreased slightly in 1989, but, according to the Asian Development Bank, production more than recovered the following year. The effect of the restrictions is most clearly shown in the export statistics for 1989—exports of timber and wood products had decreased by 30 percent from the previous year. In 1991 a new decree banned all logging until further notice, in hopes of controlling widespread illegal logging and subsequent environmental destruction. However, there was little practical impact, and illegal logging remains widespread. The smuggling of logs to Thailand also is significant.
The area of the Luang Prabang Range, at the border between Laos and Thailand, is allegedly a heartland for military involvement in timber trade.

Jimmy Flynt

Jimmy Ray Flynt (born June 20, 1948) is the co-founder of "Hustler". Flynt has been tried alongside his brother Larry Flynt in many battles involving the First Amendment − most notably in 1977 for obscenity charges in Cincinnati, Ohio. Larry was convicted; Jimmy was acquitted. The conviction was overturned.
Early life.
Jimmy Flynt was born on Lakeville Road, Salyersville, Magoffin County, Kentucky, the youngest of three children to Larry Claxton Flynt, Sr. (August 16, 1919 – July 1, 2005), a sharecropper and a World War II veteran, and Edith Arnett (August 13, 1925 – March 29, 1982), a homemaker. He had two older siblings; sister Judy (1947–1951) and brother Larry Claxton Flynt (born November 1, 1942). His father served in the United States Army in the Pacific theatre of World War II.
Career.
Mini Clubs of America and Hustler.
The Hustler Club originated in Dayton, Ohio in 1967. Brothers Larry Flynt and Jimmy Flynt envisioned a chain of semi-private nightclubs which soon became a reality with the opening of the Hustler Clubs in Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, in January 1970 and July 1971 respectively. The Hustler Club chain expanded into Toledo, Akron, and Cleveland, Ohio during the period between June, 1972 and May 1973. Mini Clubs of America developed its own Magazine titled "Hustler" which began as a newsletter in January 1972. The monthly newsletter soon developed into a full scale magazine sold on news-stands across the midwest; the "Hustler" was also sold in the clubs and mailed to over 10,000 club members with a readership of nearly 50,000 people, "Hustler" Magazine became an effective tool in the advertising and promotion of the Hustler Clubs.
On March 6, 1978, during a legal battle related to obscenity in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Larry Flynt and his local lawyer, Gene Reeves, Jr., were shot by a sniper later revealed as Joseph Paul Franklin in an ambush near the county courthouse in Lawrenceville. The shooting left Larry partially paralyzed, with permanent spinal cord damage, and in need of a wheelchair. Three months later, Larry, Jimmy, and Larry’s then-wife Althea Leasure were involved in a dispute over ownership of the Hustler enterprise. In settling this dispute, Jimmy accepted ownership of Hustler subcompany Leasure Time Products, which sent sex toys and lewd T-shirts through mail order. In November, LTP vice-president Bill Abrams was shot as he and Jimmy were leaving the Hustler building.
Flynt Sexy Gifts.
In 2012, Jimmy Flynt created Flynt Sexy Gifts, a boutique with lines of clothing, lingerie, intimate lotions, oils and specialty items targeted towards woman. The first shops were in Cincinnati, Ohio and Florence, Kentucky, with a third opening in Naples, Florida on 2013.
Politics.
Flynt is a Democrat and has long been a staunch defender of privacy and free speech, and a frequent ally of the ACLU on those issues. "Hustler" Magazine has repeatedly weighed in on public debates by trying to expose conservative or republican politicians with sexual scandals. In 1998, during the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, "Hustler" offered $1 million for each unflattering sexual story about Republican members of congress and published the results in "The Flynt Report". These publications led to the resignation of incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston.
Legal.
On February 8, 1977 Jimmy Flynt was acquitted of pandering obscenity and engaging in organized crime. Larry Flynt was convicted.
On April 7, 1998, Jimmy and Larry Flynt were indicted on 15 counts of pandering obscenity in Cincinnati, Ohio. They were accused of selling obscene videotapes and operating an illegal enterprise from their Hustler Store on Sixth Street. If convicted, they each faced more than 20 years in prison.
On May 20, 1998, the Flynt brothers got a new judge in their Cincinnati obscenity trial. Judge Patrick Dinkelacker of the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court was randomly selected to preside over the case.
On June 18, 2003, A judge was asked to decide whether Larry and Jimmy Flynt should face new criminal charges for breaking an old promise to stop selling sexually explicit videos in Hamilton County. In an unusual legal maneuver, Prosecutor Mike Allen sought to reinstate 15 felony charges that were originally filed against the Flynts in 1998.
On April 23, 2013, Judge Steven E. Martin ruled that Jimmy Flynt has a valid lease at his 411 Elm Street store, giving Flynt a victory over his brother, Hustler publisher Larry Flynt.
On April 2, 2004 the Ohio 1st District Court of Appeals ruled that Hamilton County could not reinstate old obscenity charges against Jimmy and Larry Flynt.
"When a case is over, it's over," wrote Judge Mark P. Painter in a decision handed down this morning.
It was in 1999 that the Flynts' attorneys reached an agreement with the county to release the Flynts from then-pending pandering obscenity charges by having their corporation, Hustler Gifts and News, be substituted as the defendant, plead guilty, pay a $10,000 fine and promise never to sell the charged videos in the store again.
But Allen claims that the store is once more selling sexually explicit tapes and DVDs in the county, that that's a violation of the plea agreement, and that the Flynts are liable for breaking the agreement.
According to the recorded transcript of the plea hearing, the prosecuting attorney stated that the agreement was, "Larry Flynt and Jimmy Flynt personally, and Hustler News and Gifts, Incorporated, corporately[,] agree to remove immediately, all existing videos from Hustler News and Gifts at 34 East 6th Street in Cincinnati, Ohio, and will not in the future, disseminate or cause to be disseminated, any sexually explicit videos in Hamilton County, Ohio... if Larry Flynt or Jimmy Flynt or Hustler News and Gifts, Incorporated, violate[s any of the terms of the agreement, the entire plea agreement becomes null and void, and all charges in the original indictment will be reinstated."
On October 12, 2011, Jimmy Flynt sued Flynt Management Group, LLC for wrongful termination. Jimmy Flynt contended he was the “brainchild” for the Hustler retail operations, “which has led to the second wave of growth for the Hustler Enterprise,” according to his complaint.
Achievements.
On June 20, 2002, Jimmy was inducted by his brother into the Hustler Hollywood Walk of Fame on Sunset Boulevard.
On January 7, 2005 Jimmy Flynt presented Harry Mohney with the highly coveted Reuben Sturman Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2005 AVN Awards held at the Venetian Hotel Las Vegas.
In the 1996 film "The People vs. Larry Flynt", Jimmy was played by Brett Harrelson, brother of the actor portraying Larry, Woody Harrelson.

Danny Lee (golfer)

Danny Jin-Myung Lee (born 24 July 1990) is a professional golfer from Rotorua, New Zealand. Lee was born in South Korea and emigrated to New Zealand at the age of eight. His name in Hangul is 이진명. He became a naturalized New Zealander on 2 September 2008 at Rotorua, where he attended Rotorua Boys' High School.
Amateur career.
Lee became the youngest ever winner of the U.S. Amateur Championship in August 2008, aged 18 years and one month, six months younger than Tiger Woods when he won in 1994. His age record was broken the following year by 17-year-old An Byeong-hun. He became number one in the World Amateur Golf Ranking on 20 August 2008 and remained number one until he turned pro in April 2009. He was awarded the 2008 Mark H. McCormack Medal on 27 August.
In October, he represented New Zealand at the Eisenhower Trophy in Adelaide, Australia. A final round 11-over 84 saw him finish T37 in the individual standings. The New Zealand team finished tied for 11th.
In February 2009, Lee won the Johnnie Walker Classic in Perth, Australia, a professional tournament co-sanctioned by the European, Asian, and Australasian tours. He was the youngest ever winner on the European Tour, surpassing Dale Hayes, and only the second amateur winner after Pablo Martín. The win took him to 159th place in the Official World Golf Rankings.
Lee's first major was the 2009 Masters Tournament, where his first round two-over 74 put him in a position to make the cut. In the second round he eagled the par-5 eighth and played the front nine in 34, but a disastrous six-putt led to quintuple bogey on the 10th, dropping him to five-over for the tournament. He was unable to recover, eventually finishing 11-over par.
Professional career.
2009: Bid for PGA Tour status falls short.
Lee turned professional after the 2009 Masters Tournament, forfeiting his guaranteed entry into the 2009 U.S. Open and the 2009 British Open as the 2008 U.S. Amateur champion.
In April, Lee signed a two-year endorsement contract with Callaway Golf, to use Callaway clubs, balls, and signage on his clothes. The company has not released how much his contract is worth, but sources say it is for US$1 million per year.
Lee was allowed to use seven sponsor exemptions during the PGA Tour season, and gained three other starts courtesy of his U.S. Amateur and Johnnie Walker Classic titles. His goal was to earn $537,958 which would have given him temporary membership and allowed him to receive an unlimited amount of invitations. That figure is the amount earned by the player who finished 150th on the 2008 money list.
Lee made six out of eleven PGA Tour cuts after turning pro, with two top-25 finishes. He tied for 13th at the HP Byron Nelson Championship in May, and improved on his best finish in a PGA Tour event by finishing in a tie for 7th at the AT&T National in July. That top ten finish earned Lee a spot in the following week's John Deere Classic, meaning he did not have to use one of his two remaining sponsor exemptions. The money from his T-7 finish put him $187,904 away from earning temporary status on tour. Lee missed the cut by two strokes at the John Deere Classic after bogeying the last two holes of his second round. Lee missed the cut again three weeks later at the Buick Open.
In August, Lee became the youngest player to play in a World Golf Championship event when he played the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. He finished T51 at the event. He made the cut but did not finish at the Wyndham Championship two weeks later. He used his last sponsor exemption of the season to play in that tournament and did not earn enough money on tour to earn his card for 2010.
Lee then switched his focus to the European Tour, as well as playing selected events in Asia. He made his maiden appearance as a professional in Europe at the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles where he finished T10. As a drawcard for the Korea Open and the Coca-Cola Tokai Classic in Japan, he played the first two rounds of both events with fellow teen prodigy Ryo Ishikawa.
Lee entered the PGA Tour's qualifying school at the first stage level, beginning his campaign in McKinney, Texas on 20 October. Needing to finish in roughly the top third of the field, rounds of 72-78-69-76 saw him fall well short of advancing to the second stage.
After arriving back in Asia for the Singapore Open, Lee cited swing changes, illness and cold weather as reasons for his disappointing performance in Texas, and confirmed an intention to play mainly on the European Tour in 2010. He also announced he had signed Korean-born Suckki Jang, an affiliate of Hank Haney, as his new coach. He then played the WGC-HSBC Champions, the Hong Kong Open, and represented New Zealand with David Smail at the Omega Mission Hills World Cup, all with limited success.
2010.
Lee made a poor start to the 2010 season, making just two cuts in his first nine events on the European Tour.
On the eve of the BMW PGA Championship in May, Lee announced a new partnership with English caddy Peter Coleman, and a new coach, Bill Choung. "I finally feel that I am in the right position with my swing and that has got me really excited," Lee said.
However, after receiving a sponsor's invite to play the RBC Canadian Open in July, Lee stated he was now without a swing coach. He added that he had been through several coaches since turning professional and had perhaps become too technical with his mechanics, and was now trying to focus more on playing than tweaking his swing.
Lee eventually finished the Race to Dubai in 159th place, making 10 out of 20 cuts with a best finish of T21 at the BMW International Open in June.
Late in the year, he successfully negotiated the first two stages of PGA Tour qualifying school in California. At the final stage in Florida, Lee shot rounds of 74-72-69-65-72-74 to finish T64. His placing earned him full Nationwide Tour playing rights, allowing him to plan a 35-event, two-tour itinerary for 2011.
2011.
Lee began a noticeable return to form a couple of months into the new year. A tie for 7th in the Chitimacha Louisiana Open was followed by a strong showing for 54 holes at the Malaysian Open, eventually being disqualified for signing an incorrect final round scorecard (denying him a tie for 17th). The next week he tied for 2nd at the Volvo China Open, four shots behind winner Nicolas Colsaerts.
In May, a tie for 5th in the Stadion Classic at UGA was followed by an outright third at the BMW Charity Pro-Am, lifting him to 10th on the Nationwide Tour's money list.
In June he injured his left wrist during an Open Championship qualifier, forcing his withdrawal and a four-week break from competition. Diagnosed as tendonitis, he worked with his caddy in American events, Jeff Belen, on grip and swing adjustments. By early September he had posted three further Nationwide Tour top-10 finishes, including a tie for 2nd at the Cox Classic.
In early October Lee won the WNB Golf Classic in Texas, beating Harris English in a playoff. The $94,500 first prize lifted him to 4th on the money list, assuring him of a place inside the final money list's top 25, those being the players who gain PGA Tour cards for the following season.
"It feels great to win again," Lee said. "I haven't won a tournament since I won the 2009 Johnnie Walker Classic and it's a great feeling. It's not easy to win and I worked really hard with my uncle and my coach (Bill Choung) for this. I'm really happy it worked." Lee credited the switch to a belly putter in this event as beneficial, and came after pulling out of the previous week's event after 27 holes citing his wrist injury.
Lee finished sixth on tour with earnings of $326,100, making 13 of 18 cuts with nine top-10s. He had the season's lowest scoring average of 68.98.
2012.
Lee entered the new season with PGA Tour and European Tour cards. He said he was still keen to play a two-tour schedule, however his main focus would be on America. He made only 13 cuts in 26 events on the PGA Tour and lost his tour card. He did not play on the European Tour.
After striking up a successful partnership late in the Nationwide Tour season, Lee said he would have Australian Graeme Courts, a former long-time caddy of Loren Roberts, working for him on the PGA Tour.
K. J. Choi introduced Lee to another Australian, Steve Bann, as a potential coach. "I am close with K.J. Choi and he said I was thinking too much about my swing," Lee said. "I was always working on something and I am too technical sometimes so K.J. introduced me to Steve. Steve is a simple guy who is teaching me how to practise with better routine and how to trust my own game and not think too much.
2013.
Lee played on the Web.com Tour in 2013, finishing 15th on the regular season money list to regain his PGA Tour card for 2014. His best finish was second at the Rex Hospital Open.

Rory Lee Feek

Rory Lee Feek (born in Atchison, Kansas) is an American country music singer and songwriter. In his career, he has written singles for Clay Walker, Blake Shelton, Tracy Byrd and other artists. He and his wife, Joey Martin Feek, comprise the duo Joey + Rory, who placed third on the first season of the CMT talent show "Can You Duet". He also established Giantslayer Records for launching of new independent artists.
Biography.
Rory Lee Feek was born in Atchison, Kansas. Inspired by Don Williams, Merle Haggard and other artists, he began playing guitar at age fifteen. He later served two tours of duty in the United States Marine Corps after high school, before moving to Dallas, Texas, where he played in nightclubs. Feek moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1995 after being encouraged to do by Nashville entertainment attorney Rod Phelps, and signed to a publishing contract. One of his first single releases as a songwriter was Collin Raye's "Someone You Used to Know", a Top Five country hit in 1999. A year later, Clay Walker reached Top Five as well with "The Chain of Love", another song that Feek co-wrote.
Feek continued to write for other artists in the 2000s, including album tracks for Mark Wills, Kenny Chesney, Terri Clark, Randy Travis, and Lorrie Morgan, as well as Tracy Byrd's 2003 single "The Truth About Men". In 2004, Feek achieved his first Number One as a songwriter when Blake Shelton topped the country charts with "Some Beach", which he co-wrote with Paul Overstreet. Also in 2004, Feek founded the Giantslayer Records label, on which Blaine Larsen recorded two studio albums in association with BNA Records. 
In 2008, Feek and his wife, Joey Martin Feek, founded a duo called Joey + Rory. They came in third place on the CMT talent show "Can You Duet", and later that year signed to a recording contract with Vanguard Records. Joey + Rory released their debut single "Cheater, Cheater" that year, and peaked at No. 30 on the country singles charts with it. That same year, Jimmy Wayne charted on the country charts with "I Will", another Feek co-write.

George Edward Dering

George Edward Dering (1831–1911) was a British inventor and eccentric. 
His father was Robert Dering and his mother Leititia was the daughter of Sir George Shee, 1st Baronet (1754-1825). He was educated at Rugby School. He inherited the manor of Lockleys, Welwyn, Hertfordshire from his father in 1859 and an estate in Dunmore, County Galway estate from his uncle Sir George Shee, 2nd Baronet (1784-1870).
Dering gained an interest in telegraphy from his teacher. He invented a signal detector using a needle suspended to swing like a pendulum in 1850. This detector was used by the Bank of England in its company communication system on Threadneedle Street. The Electric Telegraph Company of Ireland used the system in 1852, and Dering was made a company director. Further use was made in experiments by European Telegraph company between London and Dover, and on Great Northern Railway.
He was interested in a range of scientific and technical subjects, obtaining some twenty patents relating to telegraphy, chemistry, iron- and brick-making. His principal interest was electricity: he had a standing order with booksellers for books on the subject and amassed a huge collection, subsequently bought by Theodore Newton Vail and presented to Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also acquired the Cuthbert aeronautical collection, eventually presented to the Royal Aeronautical Society. A portion of the Cuthbert aeronautical collection was also acquired by Vail for MIT. 
Another of his interests was tight-rope walking. He was a friend of Charles Blondin and practised with him over the River Mimram on his estate.
His personal life and behaviour were eccentric. He was insistent on peace and quiet and paid for roads to be moved that ran too near his house. Around 1880, he disappeared from Lockleys, returning once a year to oversee the estate and finally returning again permanently in 1907. It transpired that he had been living in Brighton under another name, and had a family who had no knowledge of his real name and fortune.
He died in 1911 and his estates were inherited by relatives: Lockleys went to his daughter, Mrs. Neall.

<doc id="19022780" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19022780" title="Military history of Laos">
Military history of Laos

The Military history of Laos has been dominated by struggles against stronger neighbours, primarily Thailand and Vietnam, from at least the 18th century.
Early history.
Historically, Laos was subject to the will of its stronger neighbors, enforced by military means. By force of circumstances in warding off repeated foreign invasions, Laotians developed battle skills using elephants and compiled a history full of warlike deeds. Lan Xang, or the Kingdom of the Million Elephants, the first state in the recorded history of Laos, maintained a standing army of 150,000 men. Regiments included cavalry, infantry, and an elephant corps. Prince Fa Ngum, Lan Xang's founder, redeveloped the old Mongol model of an army composed of units of 10,000, which gave rise to the name of the succeeding reign, the Sam Sen Tai, or 10,000 Tai.
The army's strength enabled Fa Ngum to expand Lan Xang's borders to the western escarpment of the Khorat Plateau, the crest of the Annamite Chain in the east, and the northern edge of the Khmer and Cham civilizations in the south. To the north and east especially, however, mountain tribes resisted absorption and maintained a degree of independence.
Following Fa Ngum's death, struggles with Siamese and Burmese states in which his successors became embroiled, sapped the strength of the army and led to the decline and eventual splitting up of Lan Xang. In 1778 the capital of the Kingdom of Vientiane was attacked and destroyed for the first time by a Siamese army. By the 1820s, Laos had reestablished sovereignty over its own borders, enough that the king of Vientiane launched a disastrous military expedition against Siam (present-day Thailand). Laotian forces were overwhelmed by the superior firepower and strategy of the Siamese army, which attacked and destroyed Vientiane for a second time in 1828.
Colonial era.
1828 to 1900.
Following the destruction of Vientiane, Laotian affairs were dominated by Siam, although the Vietnamese also involved themselves from over the mountains. It was not until 1884, when France guaranteed Annam the integrity of its territorial domain, that Siamese hegemony over the eastern bank of the Mekong encountered a new challenge. Using Annam's claims to Laotian territories as a diplomatic pretext, France forced Siam to renounce all claims to territory east of the Mekong and even to islands in the river by successive treaties between 1893 and 1907.
To reinforce their security forces, which up to the twentieth century consisted largely of Vietnamese militia, the French formed local Laotian police and military constabulary units and provided them with some modern weapons, equipment, and rudimentary training. The Laotian units, whose salaries were paid for by the royal house of Louangphrabang (Luang Prabang), pledged allegiance to the monarchy, establishing a military tradition that ended only in 1975.
1901 to 1940.
Between 1901 and 1907, France's colonial forces in Laos put down a group of southern mountain Mon-Khmer rebels, who were angry that France was suppressing their customary slave-trading activities. Bandits from China's Yunnan Province also kept the colonial army occupied in the north between 1914 and 1916. The army's final major action—from 1919 to 1921—was against the Hmong led by Pa Chay, who were conducting raids on the Lao, and other groups in Houaphan and Xiangkhoang provinces, with the aim of expelling the French and establishing an independent Hmong kingdom.
1941 to 1946.
The first entirely Laotian military unit was formed by the French in 1941 and was known as the First Battalion of Chasseurs Laotiens (light infantry). It was used for internal security and did not see action until after the Japanese incursion of March 9, 1945, when Japan occupied Laos. The unit then went into the mountains, supplied and commanded by Free French agents, who had received special jungle training in camps in India and had parachuted into Laos beginning in December 1944 with the aim of creating a resistance network.
Meanwhile, taking advantage of the temporary absence of French authority in the towns, the Lao Issara government armed itself to defend the Laotian independence it had claimed on behalf of the people. For the most part, the effective components of the Lao Issara armed forces consisted of Vietnamese residents of the towns of Laos, who either had received weapons given them by the surrendering Japanese troops—sold by the Chinese Nationalist soldiers who occupied northern Laos under the 1945 Potsdam Conference agreements—or looted from French arsenals. In the Battle of Thakhek (Khammouan) in March 1946, which decided the issue of sovereignty in Laos in favor of the French, the Lao Issara used mortars and light machine guns against French armored vehicles and planes. One of the main preoccupations of the members of the Lao Issara government, exiled in Bangkok between 1946 and 1949, was to procure weapons to fight against the French.
1946 to 1954.
French efforts to train and expand the Royal Lao Army continued during the First Indochina War (1946–54), by which time Laos had a standing army of 15,000 troops. The French knew that the lightly equipped Royal Lao Army was not in a position to defend Laos against Viet Minh regular forces formed by General Vo Nguyen Giap. To counter Viet Minh invasions of Laos in 1953 and 1954, the French Union High Command diverted regular colonial units from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam into Laos; Giap exploited this weakness to disperse French Union forces. The French originally picked Dien Bien Phu as the site of a major strong point because it blocked a main invasion route into Laos, which they felt they had to defend at all cost in order to preserve their credibility with the king of Louangphrabang, who had sought France's protection. Some of the most effective fighters against the Viet Minh were Hmong from Xiangkhoang, whom the French had recruited and formed into guerrilla units; one of these units, under a sergeant named Vang Pao, was on the march to Dien Bien Phu when the garrison fell in May 1954.
Under the terms of the armistice signed at the Geneva Conference on Indochina on July 20, 1954, by the French Union High Command and the Viet Minh, all Viet Minh troops had to withdraw from Laos within 120 days. Laos was prohibited from having foreign military bases or personnel on its soil and from joining any military alliance. The agreements provided for the regrouping of Pathet Lao guerrillas in the provinces of Houaphan and Phôngsali and their integration into the Royal Lao Army. The Pathet Lao, however, taking advantage of their easy access across the border to North Vietnam, immediately began to expand their guerrilla army, the first unit of which, the Latsavong detachment, had been formed in 1949 by Kaysone Phomvihane.
Royal Lao Army.
1954 to 1961.
With the ending of the war, Laos was no longer a part of the French Union, but had instead become an entirely sovereign nation. The country was subsequently divided into five military regions and the chain of command of the Royal Lao Army was placed under the Ministry of Defense in Vientiane.
To meet the threat represented by the Pathet Lao, the Royal Lao Army depended on a small French military training mission led by a general officer—an exceptional arrangement permitted under the Geneva agreement. Laos' military organization and tactical training reflected the French military tradition. Most of the equipment possessed by the Lao military was of United States (US) origin, because the US had been supplying the French during the early phase of the First Indochina War. Matériel support ranged from guns to aircraft. In the post-war period, a small US legation remained in Vientiane and informed Washington about the status of the Royal Lao Army. The Americans became seriously concerned over the capacity of the Laotians to maintain their equipment, with the majority of items being subject to damage from the tropical sun and rain. As France was no longer responsible for Laos' finances, further concern emerged over payment of the Royal Lao Army salaries.
It seemed evident to the US legation that only United States personnel in Laos could ensure that the Royal Lao Army was capable of meeting the threat posed by the North Vietnam-backed Pathet Lao. In December 1955, as a means of circumventing the prohibition against foreign military personnel imposed by the 1954 Geneva agreement—which the US had pledged to honor—the United States Department of Defense established a disguised military mission in Laos, called the Programs Evaluation Office (PEO). The PEO worked under cover of a civilian aid mission. It was staffed by military personnel and a general officer, who wore civilian clothes was in command. During the 1955-61 period, the PEO gradually supplanted the French military mission's role as the provider of equipment and training to the Royal Lao Army. With increasing numbers of Laotian officers receiving training in Thailand, and at staff schools in the US, a perception that the French military mission in Laos was a relic of colonialism surfaced. By 1959, the PEO had more than 100 staff members and the US was paying the entire cost of the Royal Lao Army's salaries.
A treaty prohibiting Laos from joining any military alliance prevented the nation from joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) that was formed by Australia, Britain, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and the United States in September 1954. However, a protocol to the treaty designated Laos as a country for which mutual security provisions would apply in the event that it became the victim of aggression. Furthermore, with the unsuccessful integration of two Pathet Lao battalions into the Royal Lao Army, Laos faced an increased chance of attack from North Vietnamese forces. When fighting consequently broke out with North Vietnam along the Lao border between July and September 1959, the Royal Lao Government (RLG) wanted to appeal to SEATO for help. However, the RLG was dissuaded from seeking support by the US, due to the latter's fear that such an appeal could lead to the engagement of US combat troops in Laos. Also, guerrillas belonged to ethnic tribes that lived on both sides of the border, which made the question of aggression ambiguous. In January 1961, the Lao Government was again dissuaded by the US from seeking SEATO assistance, but on this occasion Kong Le was also involved in the aggression.
Kong Le's coup d'état on August 9, 1960, threatened to split the army between Kong Le's Lao Neutralist Revolutionary Organization (known as the Neutralists or the Neutralists Armed Forces) and the leadership of General Phoumi Nosavan, the former Lao minister of defense. PEO headquarters in Vientiane had become inactive, as US diplomats were instructed to find a way to isolate Nosavan and aid was eventually cut off. Meanwhile, the PEO branch office in Savannakhet, Phoumi's headquarters, continued to supply and pay Phoumi's troops. Following Phoumi's capture of Vientiane, the Neutralists were compelled, for survival, to enter into an alliance with the Pathet Lao and their North Vietnamese backers; an alliance that would thereafter provide Kong Le's organization with supplies.
1961 to 1968.
In April 1961, the PEO was upgraded to a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), and its members were allowed to wear uniforms. The MAAG was withdrawn in 1962 under the terms of the Geneva Agreement, which was supposed to neutralize Laos. Because the North Vietnamese did not respect the withdrawal requirement, the United States stepped up military aid to the Lao Government, but avoided sending ground troops into Laos, which would have violated the agreement.
As part of this effort, United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel operating from a base at Udon Thani, Thailand, took over the support of between 30,000 and 36,000 irregulars, including Hmong guerrillas who bore the brunt of the fighting in northern Laos. A CIA-chartered airline, Air America, dropped rice and ammunition from its C-46s and C-47s to isolated Hmong outposts, which were sometimes behind enemy lines. A variety of short takeoff and landing aircraft used dirt airstrips carved out of the jungle by the Hmong. The irregulars, who became known as the Secret Army, were instrumental in helping to rescue a large number of United States airmen who were shot down over Laos. By this time, Hmong leader Vang Pao had risen to the rank of general in the Royal Lao Army and commanded the Second Military Region.
In October 1964, in response to an offensive by the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese to expel the Neutralists from the Plain of Jars, the United States began providing air support against Pathet Lao positions and North Vietnamese supply lines. However, it was not until March 1966 at Phoukout, northwest of the Plain of Jars, that the Pathet Lao started to win major battles against the Royal Lao Army. In July 1966, the Pathet Lao won another major battle in the Nambak Valley in northern Louangphrabang Province by overrunning a Royal Lao Army base and inflicting heavy casualties. These victories gave the Pathet Lao new momentum in the war for control of Laos.
Meanwhile, in southern Laos, where the North Vietnamese had been working steadily every dry season to expand the Ho Chi Minh Trail leading into South Vietnam, the intensity of the air war also grew. The air war in Laos operated under a complicated command and control system that involved the United States embassy in Vientiane, the Military Assistance Command Vietnam in Saigon, Royal Thai air bases in Thailand, the commander in chief Pacific in Honolulu, and sometimes even the White House. The United States ambassador in Vientiane had the final say on target selection, using criteria that included: the distance of targets from civilian habitations and the types of ordnance to be expended. The ambassador also was to keep the Lao Government informed so as to avoid, or at least minimize, the latter's embarrassment vis-à-vis the British and Soviet embassies in Vientiane and the heads of the Indian, Canadian, and Polish delegations to the International Control Commission who were jointly responsible for enforcing the 1962 Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos signed in Geneva.
1969 to 1973.
During the June 1969 rainy season, the Pathet Lao and two North Vietnamese battalions, using Soviet tanks, pushed the Royal Lao Army and the Neutralists out of their base at Muang Sua northwest of the Plain of Jars. Fighting continued during the monsoon season. In September 1969, Vang Pao's Hmong, supported by United States bombing, launched a series of surprise attacks against key points on the Plain of Jars. A new North Vietnamese army division joined the battle shortly thereafter and by February, 1970, had regained all of the devastated plain.
In 1970, despite eight years of ground offensives by the Royal Lao Army and massive United States air support, the Pathet Lao had grown into an army of 48,000 troops and was prepared to challenge Royal Lao Army forces on their own territory by mounting large offensives in the south, engaging an even greater number of North Vietnamese forces. The introduction of Soviet-made long-range 130mm artillery pieces onto the battlefield, in that year, allowed the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese to neutralize to some extent the Royal Lao Army's advantage of air superiority.
In 1970 the combat elements of the Royal Lao Army were organized into fifty-eight infantry battalions and one artillery regiment of four battalions. The largest tactical unit was the battalion, which was composed of a headquarters, a headquarters company, and three rifle companies. Royal Lao Army units were devoted primarily to static defense and were stationed near population centers, lines of communication, depots, and airfields. These units were complemented by military police and armored, engineer, and communications units. Between 1962 and 1971, the United States provided Laos with an estimated US$500 million in military assistance, not including the cost of equipping and training irregular and paramilitary forces. During the 1971-75 period, it added about seventy-five T-28 light-strike or training aircraft, about twenty C-47s in both transport and gunship configurations, fewer than ten H-34 helicopters, and some small U-1 and U-17 aircraft.
In February 1971, a major offensive by the South Vietnamese army, with United States logistical and air support, sent two divisions into Laos in the vicinity of Xépôn, with the objective of cutting North Vietnamese supply lines. However, once inside Laos, South Vietnamese commanders were separated from their resupply bases by long logistics lines, resulting in an early termination of the offensive. By December 1971, the Pathet Lao had taken Paksong on the Bolaven Plateau and had invested the main Hmong base at Longtiang. Communist advances continued into 1972 and encircled Thakhek on the Mekong, and Vientiane.
The cease-fire of February 22, 1973, ended bombing by the United States and temporarily halted ground offensives. The Pathet Lao, however, following their usual practice, used the cessation of military operations to resupply their forces over the long and exposed roads from North Vietnam. In further fighting in the spring of 1975, the Pathet Lao finally broke the resistance of Vang Pao's Hmong blocking the road junction linking Vientiane, Louangphrabang, and the Plain of Jars. Watched by two battalions of Pathet Lao troops, which had been flown into Vientiane and Louangphrabang on Soviet and Chinese planes to neutralize those towns under the cease-fire agreement, the communists organized demonstrations to support their political and military demands, leading to the final, bloodless seizure of power in the towns that the RLG had held until then.

Caspiodontornis

Caspiodontornis is a doubtfully valid genus of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds of somewhat doubtful validity. These were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty.
Only a single species, Caspiodontornis kobystanicus, is known to date. Its remains – a fairly complete skull and beak – were found in early Late Oligocene (Chattian, MP25-30) rocks at Pirəkəşkül (Azerbaijan). From the same deposits the supposed giant swan "Guguschia nailiae" was described earlier; it is only known from wing bones. The affiliation of "G. nailiae" is not known but it does not seem to be a swan; the size of its remains agrees sufficiently well with those of "C. kobystanicus" to indicate that they may be from a single species, to which the older name "G. nailiae" would apply.

O Soundtrack My Heart

O Soundtrack My Heart is the second album by PVT (their first on Warp Records). It was released on 9 August 2008 in Australia, and 18 August in the UK / Europe through Warp Records, under the band name "Pivot".
The album was produced by Pivot in Sydney via London throughout 2006, tracked by Scott Horscroft, mixed by John McEntire (Tortoise, The Sea and Cake) in May 2007 and mastered by Noel Sommerville (Interpol, White Stripes).
The album's cover art is notable in that it contains images by French artist Michel Granger who was also responsible for the iconic sleeve of Jean Michel Jarre's album "Oxygène". Indeed, the sleeve of "O Soundtrack My Heart" bears great thematic similarity to the cover of Jarre's "Oxygène 7–13" album.
In 2009 the song "Fool In Rain" was covered by Scott Herren's 'Diamond Watch Wrists' for the "Warp20 (Recreated)" compilation.

Law of Laos

Civil Liberties and Human Rights.
The Laos criminal justice system is controlled by the party and the government. There are few legal restraints on government actions, including arrests, which are often arbitrary in nature. Dissent is frequently handled by suppressing basic civil rights. Although the constitution provisions of the mid-1990s cover freedom of worship, expression and press, citizens by December 2010 were not free to exercise these rights fully. There were no legal safeguards and arrests were commonly made on vague charges. 
A penal code and a constitution which guarantee civil liberties have been proposed. Implementation is another matter, particularly in the area of freedom of political expression. The media is state-controlled.
Nonetheless, there is a system for prosecuting criminal behavior. Common crimes are evaluated at the local village level. More serious cases, especially politically sensitive ones, are referred to higher authorities. Tribunals operate at district and provincial levels with judges appointed by the government.
Both Laotian journalists and Western officials are critical of the limitations on personal freedoms. In 1987, a Laotian journalist living in Thailand noted that there was little popular support for the government, but that most Laotians accepted its authority because they had little choice. In 1988, a Laotian journalist protested that open criticism of the government was forbidden and one of his friends was imprisoned after he complained about the continuing lack of a constitution. The same year, Western diplomats reported that hundreds or thousands of individuals were being held in detention centers in Laos and that citizens were being arrested and held for months without being charged.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the government instituted the New Economic Mechanism, a series of sweeping economic reforms geared toward establishing a market-oriented economy. Along with these economic reforms came a slight opening to the West, which provided some opportunity for scrutiny of human rights violations. However, few foreign journalists are allowed to visit Laos, and travel by diplomats and foreign aid workers is restricted. Both domestic and foreign travel by Laotians also is subject to scrutiny and restriction.
The Ministry of Interior is the main instrument of state control and guardianship over the criminal justice system. Ministry of Interior police monitor both Laotians and foreign nationals who live in Laos; there is a system of informants in workplace committees and in residential areas. According to the United States Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, both the party and state monitor various aspects of family and social life through neighborhood and workplace committees. These committees are responsible for maintaining public order and reporting "bad elements" to the police, as well as carrying out political training and disciplining employees.
The criminal justice system is deficient in the area of legal precedent and representation. Trials are not held in public, although trial verdicts are publicly announced. Although there is some provision for appeal, it does not apply to important political cases. Under the constitution, judges and prosecutors are supposed to be independent with their decisions free from outside scrutiny. In practice, however, the courts appear to accept recommendations of other government agencies, especially the Ministry of Interior, in making their decisions. Theoretically, the government provides legal counsel to the accused. In practice, however, defendants represent themselves without outside counsel.
The National Assembly enacted a criminal code and laws establishing a judiciary in November 1989 and a new constitution was adopted by the National Assembly in 1991. 
In 1992 the government launched a campaign to publicize the latter. The leadership claims efforts at developing a legal system with a codified body of laws and a penal code. However, as of mid-1994, there had been little, if any, progress in implementing the freedoms provided for in the constitution and the legal codes still had not been implemented with individuals still being held without being informed of charges or their accusers' identities.
Detention centers.
In Laos, there are four categories of persons held in confinement by the State. Aside from common criminals, there are also political, social, and ideological dissidents. These are people who the government feels are a threat to their control, most commonly because of their public objection to governmental policies or actions. Commonly the specific crimes for which these dissidents are arrested and confined are vague at best. Their arrests are typically arbitrary and their length of confinement ambiguous and indefinite.
The LPDR established four different types of detention centers: prisons, reeducation centers or seminar camps, rehabilitation camps, and remolding centers. Social deviants or common criminals were considered less threatening to the regime than persons accused of political crimes, who were considered potential counterrevolutionaries; social deviants were confined in rehabilitation camps. According to MacAlister Brown and Joseph J. Zasloff, prisons were primarily reserved for common criminals, but political prisoners were also held there for usually six to twelve months. Ideologically suspect persons were sent to remolding centers. Reeducation centers were for those deemed politically risky, usually former RLG officials. Political prisoners usually served three- to five-year terms or longer. At the prisons, inmates worked hard under rugged conditions and had limited supplies of food. Bribery in order to secure food and medicine was reported.
In 1986, Brown and Zasloff also reported that prisoners were not tried but were incarcerated by administrative fiat. Former inmates said that they were arrested, informed by the security officials that they had been charged with crimes, and then sent off to camps for indeterminate periods. Typically, prisoners were told one day prior to their release to prepare for departure.
The status of the detention centers is also vague. In 1984, Vientiane declared that all reeducation centers had been closed. At that time, Amnesty International estimated that 6,000 to 7,000 political prisoners were held in these centers. The government acknowledged that there were some former inmates in remote areas but claimed that their confinement was voluntary. In the late 1980s, the government closed some of the reeducation centers and released most of the detainees.
In 1989, Laos took steps to reduce the number of political prisoners, many of whom had been held since 1975. Several hundred detainees, including many high-ranking officials and officers from the former United States-backed RLG and Royal Lao Army, were released from reeducation centers in the northeastern province of Houaphan. Released prisoners reported that hundreds of individuals remained in custody in as many as eight camps, including at least six generals and former high-ranking members of the RLG. These individuals reportedly performed manual labor such as log cutting, repairing roads, and building irrigation systems. In 1993, Amnesty International reported human rights violations in the continued detention of three "prisoners of conscience" detained since 1975 but not sentenced until 1992, as well as those held under restrictions or, according to international standards, the subjects of unfair trials.
As of 1993, reports indicated that some high-ranking officials of the RLG and military remained in state custody. Those accused of hostility toward the government were subject to arrest and confinement for long periods of time. Prison conditions were harsh, and prisoners were routinely denied family visitation and proper medical care.

Cyphornis

Cyphornis is a genus of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds. These were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty.
Description.
Only a single species, Cyphornis magnus, is known to date. It is only known with certainty from a single specimen, the rather abraded proximal part of a left tarsometatarsus which was found at Carmanah Point on Vancouver Island (Canada), where the Juan de Fuca Strait opens into the Pacific. The deposits from which it originated were initially dated to the Eocene; subsequent authors have usually assigned them to the Early Miocene though certainly rocks from around the Eo-Oligocene boundary also occur in the region where it was found. At the time of its discovery, it "probably represent the largest known bird of flight." Even today it is one of the largest (though not heaviest) flying birds known.
Some huge pseudotooth wing bone fossils have been found in Oregon. Specimen LACM 128462, a mostly complete proximal end of a left ulna, originates from the Keasey Formation of Washington County. LACM 127875 are fragments of the proximal humerus ends, the proximal right ulna and the right radius of a single individual presumed to be of the same species; they were found in the Pittsburg Bluff Formation near Mist. These remains all date from the Eo-Oligocene boundary, and considering their size they may well be of "C. magnus" if it is in fact that old, or of its ancestor or older relative.
Systematics.
Due to its fragmentary nature – the bones of pseudotooth bords are very thin-walled and light and notoriously easily broken and crushed when fossilizing – it was often allied with the enigmatic "Cladornis", and though placed in the order Pelecaniformes (as pseudotooth birds often were) separated in a suborder Cladornithes. But the slightly older (Late Oligocene) "Cladornis" from the Argentinian part of Patagonia is known from a distal right tarsometatarsus only, and thus not directly comparable to "Cyphornis". The two genera were allied simply because of their size and because they both vaguely reminded of the tarsometatarsus of pelicans. Today however, "Cladornis" is more generally held to be a terrestrial bird rather than a seabird. Other authors had been more conservative all along, and considered "Cyphornis" quite close to pelicans, uniting these as a superfamily Pelecanides in suborder Pelecanae, or later on (after the endings of taxonomic ranks were fixed to today's standard) Pelecanoidea in suborder Pelecani.
To set it apart from its alleged relatives, "Cyphornis" was early on separated in a family Cyphornithidae together with "Palaeochenoides mioceanus" and eventually also "Tympanonesiotes wetmorei" which are also little-known pseudotooth birds but inhabited the Atlantic. But these are probably all closely related to the better-known "Pelagornis", type genus of the family Pelagornithidae. And even if "Cyphornis" is the senior synonym of all the later-described genera (which is not very likely), according to the rules of zoological nomenclature the family name Pelagornithidae would not change. Thus Cyphornithidae would almost certainly be a junior synonym of Pelagornithidae even if the pseudotooth birds are (as some have proposed) divided into several families – rather than being all placed in the Pelagornithidae as is usual nowadays –, as "Cyphornis", "Osteodontornis", "Palaeochenoides", "Pelagornis" and perhaps the smaller "Tympanoneisiotes" appear to be very closely related and are probably all part of a monophyletic lineage of (usually) giant pseudotooth birds. Only if the Pacific lineage is sufficiently distinct, the Cyphornithidae would remain valid, but in this case they would presumably not include the Atlantic forms.

Andrzej Garbuliński

Andrzej Garbuliński was a Polish farmer who lived in the village of Czerna with his family: Władysław, Eleonora,Marian,Helena, Kunegunda,Stanisław, Kazimierz, Jan and two wives Zofia and Kazimiera during the Nazi German occupation of Poland in World War II. He was executed by the Nazis with his oldest son Władysław, in late 1943, for aiding and sheltering Jews. 
In 1940, a neighboring Jewish family of Alfenbeins from the same village of Czerna—who escaped from the Płaszów concentration camp—asked the Garbulińskis for help and shelter. Among them, Sarah Alfenbein, her daughter Hanna and son Meir. Just before they arrived at the farm, they hid at the nearby home of Stanisław Owce. The Garbulinskis took the Jews in, and cared of them for the next two years. 
In late 1943, the Gestapo gendarmerie came to the village. As they headed for the farm, Andrzej Garbuliński asked the hiding Jews to run. However, they were spotted at a field while escaping. The mother and son were killed on the spot. The daughter Hanna managed to keep running and had the Germans chase after her for a while. At the end, she was also murdered. Andrzej Garbuliński and his son Władysław were immediately arrested and taken to the Jasło prison. The father was sentenced to death and executed there. Władysław was transferred to a separate prison where he was also killed. The only family members who survived the war were Eleonora, Helena, Kunegunda, Marian, Stanislaw, Kazimierz and Jan .
In 1997 the Garbuliński family was recognized as the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Jerusalem for their daring attempt at saving a Jewish family from the Holocaust; Andrzej and Władysław, for giving their lives in the process.

Commelina virginica

Commelina virginica, commonly known as the Virginia dayflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the dayflower family. It is native to the mideastern and southeastern United States, where it is typical of wet soils. While most members of the genus have thin, fibrous roots, the Virginia dayflower is relatively unique for its genus in having a perennial rhizome. The plant was first described by Carolus Linnaeus in his 1762 publication of the second edition of "Species Plantarum". A phylogenetic study based on the nuclear ribosomal DNA region 5S NTS and the chloroplast region trnL-trnF, two commonly used gene regions for determining relationships, suggested that "Commelina virginica" is most closely related to two African species, namely "Commelina capitata" and "Commelina congesta". However, the statistical support for this result was low. morphologically speaking the supposedly related species do share some unique traits. "C. virginica" and "C. capitata" have red hairs at the top of their leaf sheaths, an unusual character in the genus, while "C. virginica" and "C. congesta" both have clustered inflorescences on very short stalks.

1985 Australian Touring Car Championship

The 1985 Australian Touring Car Championship was a CAMS sanctioned motor racing title for drivers of Touring Cars. It was the 26th running of the Australian Touring Car Championship and the first to be contested using regulations based on the FIA's International Group A regulations. The championship began on 10 February 1985 at Winton Motor Raceway (the track's first ever ATCC race) and ended on 14 July at Oran Park Raceway after ten rounds.
Triple Bathurst winner Jim Richards won his first Australian Touring Car Championship driving a BMW 635 CSi entered by JPS Team BMW. Defending series champion Dick Johnson finished 2nd in his Ford Mustang, with Peter Brock finishing third in his near standard Holden Commodore.
The first round of the series also created history when for the first time since the ATCC was first held in 1960, no Holden of any sort was on the grid. The race also saw the first ever ATCC race win by a BMW with Richards winning by a lap from his JPS team mate Neville Crichton. Volvo also joined the winners list when Auckland based Kiwi Robbie Francevic won Round 3 at Symmons Plains in Tasmania. Francevic's win also saw him become the first non-Australian resident to win an ATCC race.
Richards (Winton, Wanneroo, Adelaide, Calder, Surfers, Lakeside and Amaroo), Brock (Sandown) and Francevic (Symmons Plains and Oran Park) were the only drivers to win a race in the series.
Teams and drivers.
"* Peter Brock and John Harvey both drove #05 and #7 during the season.
Race Calendar.
The 1985 Australian Touring Car Championship was contested over a ten round series with one race per round.
Classes.
Cars competed in three classes determined by engine capacity.
Points system.
Championship points were allocated on a three tier system, to Australian license holders only, for "outright" places gained in each round:
Points from the best nine round results were retained by each driver, any other points not being included in the nett total.

Andravida Air Base

Andravida military airport is a military airport that is 2.5 kilometres away from the city center of Andravida. Construction began in the 1950s to expand the Greek military and military aviation services throughout the state. The cost of building the airport and some facilities were about $1,000,000 (10,000,000 drachmas) to $5,000,000. The length of the runway is 2 kilometres and the size is exactly 1². It is the longest airport in Ilia.
The airport is bordered and almost surrounded with 80% or 4 kilometres of green (leafy) and pine trees, except of those at runway points. The setting is located in a forested area. There are more forest lying east of the military airport. Cultivated plains lie to the west. Military exercises have occurred since its opening.
Incidents and accidents.
In 2000, parts from a Greek military aircraft landed on a rural residential house, no fatalities were caused, however, a refrigerator was damaged by the part after crashing through the roof. Days later, demonstrators protested against any more military exercises in the area citing noise level and possible further incidents. Similar incidents occurred in the 1960s.

Ambrosia confertiflora is a species of ragweed known by the common name weakleaf bur ragweed. 
It is native to much of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States as far east as Kansas and Oklahoma. It is a perennial herb reaching heights between 30 centimeters and nearly two meters with bristly, fuzzy green to brown erect stems. The multilobed fuzzy leaves have blades which can be nearly 16 centimeters long and are borne on petioles with lobed, winglike appendages. As in other ragweeds, the inflorescence has staminate (male) and pistillate (female) flower heads. The pistillate heads yield one or two fruits which are burrs up to half a centimeter long and covered in short spines.

Colorado Experiment

The Colorado Experiment was a bodybuilding experiment run by Arthur Jones using Nautilus equipment at the Colorado State University in May 1973.
It is of interest due to its claims that incredible results can be achieved with a small number of sessions using single sets of high intensity repetitions to momentary muscle failure focusing on negative or lowering multi-joint exercises. The first subject, Casey Viator, was said to have gained 63 pounds of muscle in 28 days and the second, Arthur Jones, gained 15 pounds in 22 days.
These claims are considered controversial because it was only performed with two subjects who were not "average," but regaining pre-existing muscle mass.
The results of the experiment do not appear to have been repeated in a scientific study.

Melyridae

Melyridae (common name: soft-wing flower beetles) are a family of beetles of the superfamily Cleroidea. 
Description.
Most are elongate-oval, soft-bodied beetles 10 mm long or less. Many are brightly colored with brown or red and black. Some melyrids (Malachiinae) have peculiar orange structures along the sides of the abdomen, which may be everted and saclike or withdrawn into the body and inconspicuous. Some melyrids have the two basal antennomeres greatly enlarged. Most adults and larvae are predaceous, but many are common on flowers. The most common North American species belong to the genus "Collops" (Malachiinae); "C. quadrimaculatus" is reddish, with two bluish black spots on each elytron. Batrachotoxins are found in them.
Distribution.
The family Melyridae contains 520 species in 58 genera in North America. In Europe 16 genera are present; however, the largest diversity is in tropical rainforests.

<doc id="19023112" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19023112" title="HIV/AIDS in Angola">
HIV/AIDS in Angola

Angola has a large HIV/AIDS infected population. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated adult prevalence at the end of 2003 at 3.9% - over 420,000 infected people.
Prevalence.
Angola is at a critical point in its fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. While the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated adult prevalence at the end of 2003 at 3.9%, recent statistics from the Angolan Ministry of Health and the National AIDS Control Program demonstrate a prevalence of 2.8% among pregnant women seeking prenatal care. While the low rate is heartening news, a number of factors in place argue that the prevalence could soon mimic the rapid upward trajectory experienced in other African countries.
Angola’s 27-year civil war (1975-2002), deterred the spread of HIV by making large portions of the country inaccessible. Angola was thus cut off from most contact with neighboring countries that had higher HIV infection rates. With the end of the war, however, transportation routes and communication are reopening, therefore enabling a greater potential for the spread of HIV/AIDS. Indeed, current statistics indicate that the border provinces, especially certain areas bordering Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, currently have higher prevalence than the rest of the country.
Nearly 70% of the population in Angola is under the age of 24. A 2003 knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) survey conducted among people aged 14 to 24 showed 43% of young people had had sex by the age of 15, one of the highest rates in the world. The respondents identified as barriers to HIV prevention limited availability and use of condoms, and limited access to health care. They also reported a high incidence of sexually transmitted infections, all conditions that leave the country ripe for a spike in HIV.
HIV is transmitted primarily through multi-partner heterosexual sex, with a male-to-female ratio of 0.8:1, indicating that women are more likely to be infected than men. Contaminated needles, medical devices, and blood transfusions are the second largest spreader of HIV/AIDS, although more specific research in this area is needed. Mother-to-child transmission currently accounts for approximately 15% of HIV cases. 
National response.
Angola faces extreme economic, social, and political problems. An estimated 68% of the population lives in poverty and 26% in extreme poverty. Nevertheless, the government is committed to confronting the HIV/AIDS epidemic and is working vigilantly with international donors, churches, foundations, and nongovernmental organizations to deliver HIV/AIDS-prevention and mitigation services to the public.
Angola’s National AIDS Control Program Nacional de Luta contra o Sida (PNLS) was established as part of the Ministry of Health in 1987 to serve as the national coordinating body in the fight against HIV/AIDS. With the exception of employee salaries, the PNLS’ work has been financed almost entirely through external donations.
The National AIDS Commission was established in 2002 to bring stronger, high-level government attention to the epidemic, and an HIV/AIDS strategy for the 2003–2008 period is being carried out. The strategy calls for special attention to a wide variety of vulnerable populations: sex workers, truck drivers, mine workers, military personnel, youth, street children, pregnant women, dislocated people, refugees and resettled populations, prisoners, injecting drug users, blood transfusion recipients, traditional healers, traditional birth attendants, health workers, and children living with or affected by HIV/AIDS.
In June 2004, the Angolan National Assembly passed a comprehensive HIV/AIDS law with the purpose of “protecting and promoting full health through the adoption of measures needed to prevent, control, treat and investigate HIV/AIDS.”3 Specifically, the law is designed to protect the rights of those living with HIV/AIDS, including the right to employment, free public health care, and confidentiality in the health care system.
Angola has developed national guidelines for providing integrated care to people living with HIV/AIDS; however, the mechanisms for distributing antiretroviral drugs need to be implemented outside of Luanda. Approximately 2,750 people are currently on antiretroviral therapy, but approximately 30,000 people are in need of the drugs.
Thus far, the low HIV prevalence in Angola has not had a severe impact on Angola’s economic productivity; however, if the spread of HIV continues, it is likely that the epidemic will be particularly devastating to the agricultural, transportation, mining, and education sectors. Fear of HIV/AIDS is strong, and people with HIV/AIDS face stigma on a daily basis. In fact, the 2003 KAP study reports that, “If a local shopkeeper were known to be HIV-positive, nearly half of all young people (and more than two-thirds of those with no education) said they would refuse to buy food from him. Similarly, more than one-third (and nearly two-thirds of those with no education) would refuse to share a meal with an HIV-positive person.” Finally, Angola has approximately 1 million orphans, about 11% whom have lost one or both parents to AIDS.

HIV/AIDS in Benin

The number of adults and children living with HIV/AIDS in Benin in 2003 was estimated by the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to range between 38,000 and 120,000, with nearly equal numbers of males and females. A recent study conducted by the National AIDS Control Program estimated the number of people living with HIV/AIDS to be 71,950. In 2003, an estimated 6,140 adults and children died of AIDS. Benin has a well-functioning system of antenatal HIV surveillance; in 2002, the median HIV prevalence at 36 antenatal clinics was 1.9%. Another study in 2002 showed an overall prevalence of 2.3% among adults in Cotonou, Benin's largest city.
Heterosexual intercourse and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) are the primary modes of HIV transmission in Benin. HIV prevalence is relatively low compared with rates in most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, but the virus is spreading steadily among young adults and vulnerable populations. In a 2002 study, an HIV prevalence of 44.7% was found among sex workers in four urban areas. In 2002, another study showed that HIV among sex workers in Cotonou, while still very high, had declined from nearly 60% in 1996 to 50% in 1999 and to 39% in 2002.
At the end of 2003, approximately 5,700 children aged 14 or younger were living with HIV/AIDS, mainly as a result of MTCT of HIV. At the end of 2003, nearly 34,000 children under age 17 had lost one or both parents to AIDS, and only 1,000 of these had received assistance such as food aid, health care, protection services, or psychosocial support.
Although knowledge of HIV and modes of transmission and prevention is widespread in Benin, prevention communication efforts have not led to a corresponding shift in behavior. The rising incidence of HIV is due primarily to poverty, migration, unsafe sexual practices, misperceptions regarding risk, and the low status of women, 80% of whom are illiterate.
National response.
Benin is a very poor country. More than a third of the population lives in poverty. Adult illiteracy, especially among women, and under-five child mortality are both high. Population growth is making it difficult for Benin to achieve sustainable social and economic development.
The president and other political leaders have publicly supported the fight against HIV/AIDS. National funding for HIV/AIDS activities, derived from the federal budget and debt-relief funds, totalled approximately $3.2 million in 2003.
With the current plan for the period 2001–2005, Benin is nearing the end of its fourth intermediate national strategy to control HIV/AIDS. The plan calls for promoting greater awareness of HIV/AIDS through a variety of public information, education, and communication efforts. Prevention, care, support, and treatment efforts are aimed at youth, women, migrants, sex workers, and persons living with HIV/AIDS. Benin receives multinational support for HIV/AIDS activities from the United States; the five-country, World Bank-led HIV/AIDS Abidjan-Lagos Transport Corridor project; the World Health Organization (WHO) 3x5 Initiative; and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). Still, Benin faces a financial gap of approximately $32 million to fully implement its national strategic plan.

Microseism

In seismology, a microseism is defined as a faint earth tremor caused by natural phenomena. The term is most commonly used to refer to the dominant background seismic noise signal on Earth, which are caused by water waves in the oceans and lakes. Because the ocean wave oscillations are statistically homogenous over several hours, the microseism signal is a long-continuing oscillation of the ground.
The most energetic seismic waves that make up the microseismic field are Rayleigh waves, but Love waves can make up a significant fraction 
of the wave field, and body waves are also easily detected with arrays. Because the conversion from the ocean waves to the seismic waves is very 
weak, the amplitude of ground motions associated to microseisms does not generally exceed 10 micrometers. 
Detection and characteristics.
Microseisms are very well detected and measured by means of a broad-band seismograph, and can be recorded anywhere on Earth. 
Dominant microseism signals from the oceans are linked to characteristic ocean swell periods, and thus occur between approximately 4 to 30 seconds. Microseismic noise usually displays two predominant peaks. The weaker is for the larger periods, typically close to 16 s, and can be explained by the effect of surface gravity waves in shallow water. These microseisms have the same period as the water waves that generate them, and are usually called 'primary microseisms'. The stronger peak, for shorter periods, is also due to surface gravity waves in water, but arises from the interaction of waves with nearly equal frequencies but nearly opposite directions. These tremors have a period which is half of the water wave period and are usually called 'secondary microseisms'. A slight, but detectable, incessant excitation of the Earth's free oscillations, or normal modes, with periods in the range 30 to 1000 s are also caused by water waves, and is often referred to as the "Earth hum". This hum is probably generated like the secondary microseisms but from the interaction of infragravity waves. 
As a result, from the short period 'secondary microseisms' to the long period 'hum', this seismic noise contains information on the sea states. It can be used to estimate ocean wave properties and their variation, on time scales of individual events (a few hours to a few days) 
to their seasonal or multi-decadal evolution. Understanding these signals, however, requires a basic understanding of the microseisms generation processes
Generation of 'secondary' microseisms.
The interaction of two trains of surface waves of different frequencies and directions generates wave groups. 
For wave propagating almost in the same direction, this gives the usual sets of waves that travel at the group speed, which is slower than phase speed of water waves (see animation). For typical 
ocean waves with a period around 10 seconds, this group speed is close to 10 m/s. 
In the case of opposite propagation direction the groups travel at a much larger speed, which is 
now 2 π(f1+f2)/(k1-k2) with k1 and k2 the wave numbers of the interacting water waves. 
phase speed of linear water waves, and the groups of large waves propagate slower (Animation)]]
For wave trains with a very small difference in frequency (and thus wavenumbers), this pattern of wave groups may have the same velocity as seismic waves, between 1500 and 3000 m/s, and will excite acoustic-seismic modes that radiate away. 
[[File:wave_group_minus_small.gif|right|thumb|Wave groups generated by waves with opposing directions. The blue curve is the sum of the red and black. In the animation, watch the crests with the red and black dots. These crests move with the 
phase speed of linear water waves, but the groups propagate much faster (Animation)]]
As far as seismic and acoustic waves are concerned, the motion of ocean waves in deep water is, to the leading order, equivalent to a pressure applied at the sea surface. This pressure is nearly equal to the water density times the wave orbital velocity squared. Because of this square, it is not the amplitude of the individual wave trains that matter (red and black lines in the figures) but the amplitude of the sum, the wave groups (blue line in figures). 
Real ocean waves are composed of an infinite number of wave trains and there is always some energy propagating in the opposite direction. Also, because the seismic waves are much faster than the water waves, the source of seismic noise is isotropic: the same amount of energy 
is radiated in all directions. In practice, the source of seismic energy is strongest 
when there are a significant amount of wave energy travelling in opposite directions. This occurs 
when swell from one storm meets waves with the same period from another storm, or close 
to the coast due coastal reflection. 
Depending on the geological context, the noise recorded by a seismic station on land can be 
representative of the sea state close to the station (within a few hundred kilometers, for example
in Central California), or a full ocean basin (for example in Hawaii). In order to understand the noise properties, it is thus necessary to understand the propagation of the seismic waves.
Form of Rayleigh waves modified by the ocean layer: free waves and forced waves.
The waves that compose most of the secondary microseismic field are Rayleigh waves. Both water and solid Earth particles are displaced by the waves as they propagate, and the water layer 
plays a very important role in defining the celerity, group speed and the transfer of energy 
from the surface water waves to the Rayleigh waves.

HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

Prevalence.
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) was one of the first African countries to recognize HIV, registering cases of HIV among hospital patients as early as 1983. At the end of 2001, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that 1.3 million Congolese (adult and children) were living with HIV/AIDS, yielding an overall HIV prevalence of 4.9%. Beyond the 5% mark, the country’s epidemic will be considered “high level,” or firmly established within the general population. By the end of 2003, UNAIDS estimated that 1.1 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, for an overall adult HIV prevalence of 4.2%.
The main mode of HIV transmission occurs through heterosexual activity, which is linked to 87% of cases. The most affected age groups are women aged 20 to 29 and men aged 30 to 39. Life expectancy in the DR Congo dropped 9% in the 1990s as a result of HIV/AIDS.
According to UNAIDS, several factors fuel the spread of HIV in the DR Congo, including movement of large numbers of refugees and soldiers, scarcity and high cost of safe blood transfusions in rural areas, a lack of counseling, few HIV testing sites, high levels of untreated sexually transmitted infections among sex workers and their clients, and low availability of condoms outside Kinshasa and one or two provincial capitals. With the imminent end of hostilities and a government of transition, population movements associated with increased stability and economic revitalization will exacerbate the spread of HIV, which is now localized in areas most directly affected by the presence of troops and war-displaced populations. Consecutive wars have made it nearly impossible to conduct effective and sustainable HIV/AIDS prevention activities. In addition, the HIV-tuberculosis coinfection rate ranges from 30 to 50%.
The number of Congolese women living with HIV/AIDS is growing. UNAIDS estimates indicate that, at the end of 2001, more than 60% (670,000) of 1.1 million adults aged 15–49 currently living with HIV/AIDS were women. Infection rates among pregnant women tested in 1999 in major urban areas ranged from 2.7 to 5.4%. Outside the major urban areas, 8.5% of pregnant women tested in 1999 were HIV-positive.
Between 1985 and 1997, infection rates among sex workers in Kinshasa ranged from 27 to 38%. More than one-half (58%) of the total population is under 15 years of age. The AIDS epidemic has had a disproportionate impact on children, causing high morbidity and mortality rates among infected children and orphaning many others. Approximately 30 to 40% of infants born to HIV-positive mothers will become infected with HIV. According to UNAIDS, by the end of 2001 an estimated 170,000 children under the age of 15 were living with HIV/AIDS, and 927,000 children had lost one or both parents to the disease.
In 2003 and 2004, a national HIV surveillance survey conducted jointly by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National AIDS Control Program among pregnant women revealed an increase in HIV prevalence rates in rural and urban areas highly affected by consecutive wars, e.g., in Lodja (6.6%) and in Kisangani (6.6%).
National response.
DR Congo is emerging from years of civil conflict. In 2003, former combatants signed peace agreements, and foreign troops left the country. National elections are scheduled for 2005. Despite poor health indicators and rampant poverty—leading to its 2004 rank as one of the 10 poorest countries in the world—DR Congo was one of the first countries in Africa to recognize and address HIV/AIDS as an epidemic and one of the few in which the rate of HIV infection has remained relatively stable.
The interim DR Congo government has shown growing interest in expanding HIV/AIDS services and improving the quality of services but lacks the necessary infrastructure and resources. Therefore, HIV/AIDS activities have recently resumed, but only to a limited extent. As per the national HIV/AIDS strategic framework (1999–2008), the DR Congo government favors prevention, care, and advocacy activities that highlight community participation, human rights and ethics, and the needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS. To implement this strategy nationwide, the DR Congo government solicits participation from all development partners, including private sector, faith-based, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
Internal migration, endemic poverty, widespread risk behavior, sexually transmitted infections, and lack of a safe blood supply are some of the challenges to stemming HIV/AIDS in DR Congo.
The National AIDS Control Program, chaired by the Minister of Health, was established in the early 1990s. Recently, with considerable support from the World Bank, the DR Congo is establishing a multisectoral national control program called Programme National Multisectorial de Lutte contre le SIDA. It is attached to the Office of the President and will act as the central unit for planning, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation of all HIV/AIDS/STI activities in the country. Another important opportunity offered to the DR Congo is funding from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

HIV/AIDS in Ivory Coast

The infection rate of HIV/AIDS in Ivory Coast is estimated at 7.1 percent in adults ages 15–49. Ivory Coast has a generalized HIV epidemic with the highest prevalence rate in the West African region. The prevalence rate appears to have remained relatively stable for the past decade, with recent declines among pregnant women in urban areas. Civil conflict in the country continues to hinder the collection of new national HIV-related data.
In 2005, a national AIDS Indicator Survey was completed, which provided accurate data on various aspects of the epidemic, including prevalence rates among diverse demographic sub-groups. Populations at comparatively high risk for HIV infection include women ages 20–24, people in prostitution, youth and the military. The prolonged political-military crisis, in addition to exacerbating the vulnerability of these groups, is likely to have created additional at-risk populations given the large-scale military deployment, massive population displacement, and increase in poverty.
Political instability, delays in the disarmament process and the threat of armed insurgency continue to be major challenges and barriers to external assistance. The prolonged sociopolitical crisis has disrupted and restricted access to health and other public services, while at the same time increasing HIV transmission and vulnerability among many sub-populations. Ivory Coast has a more developed public health and education system in terms of human resources and infrastructure than many of its neighbors, but the overall health system is weak, and health and economic gains have been reversed by the crisis. Currently, blood screening services and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis are very limited. Regions in the North and West, which have not been under government control, have experienced a complete and prolonged disruption of public-sector services and an exodus of skilled professionals. Major disparities exist between urban and rural health services, with a paucity of health professionals and private practitioners outside the major cities.

Kosovo–Turkey relations

Kosovan–Turkish relations refers to the historic and current relationship between the Republic of Kosovo and Turkey. When Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, Turkey became one of the first countries to announce officially about recognition of sovereign Kosovo. Turkey turned its coordination office in Pristina into an embassy after a cabinet decision to open a mission in Kosovo. The decision comes in accordance with the reciprocity principle common in diplomatic relations, when Kosovo announced that it was planning to open one of its first foreign missions in Ankara. The ethnic Albanian Kosovars living in Turkey is estimated to be higher than those living in Kosovo. Kosovo is the home to Mehmet Akif Ersoy, writer of the Turkish National Anthem, and many others. There are 20,000 Turks living in Kosovo. Also Turkish is one of the official regional languages of Kosovo.
When the Ottomans left the region, many Turks and Albanians migrated to Turkey so ties between two the two nations were active.
Military.
Turkey participated in the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which resulted in a UN administration of Kosovo and then to eventual independence. Turkey currently has 540 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO led Kosovo Force.

Seoul National University Hospital

Seoul National University Hospital (서울대학교병원) is one of the oldest and biggest hospitals in South Korea. It is a general and teaching hospital of Seoul National University's School of Medicine. Its headquarters are in Yeon-gun, Jong-ro in Seoul (서울특별시 종로구 연건동). 
Seoul National University Hospital consists of four branches:
Except SNUH Healthcare System Gangnam Center, all branches have an emergency department (ED).
SNUH is owned and operated by SNUH Special Corporation, independent from Seoul National University. The South Korean government's Ministry of Education and Human Resources partly supervises management of the hospital.
History.
Seoul National University Hospital was started as Naebu Hospital (내부병원) and changed into Gwangjewon (광제원) in 1900 and Daehan Hospital (대한의원) in 1907. In 1910, when Imperial Japan colonized Korea, its name changed to Viceroyalty Hospital of Chosun (조선총독부의원). During the colonization period, the institution was under the direct supervision of the Japanese viceroyalty. Koreans had a rather scarce number of opportunities to learn medicine at that time. 
In 1924, the viceroyalty moved the site of the hospital to the current location of SNUH. When Imperial Japan surrendered to the United States in 1945, Korea was liberated from Japanese rule. After liberation, the government of the Republic of Korea installed Seoul National University's School of Medicine on the site of the Viceroyalty Hospital. Until 1978, SNUH was a state-owned hospital. However, the government handed off the hospital's ownership by forming SNUH P.C., an independent professional corporation.

HIV/AIDS in Ghana

Like other countries worldwide, HIV/AIDS is present in Ghana. As of 2010, an estimated 230,000 people infected with the virus. HIV prevalence was at 1.3 percent in 2012 and is highest in the Eastern Region of Ghana and lowest in the northern regions of the country. In response to the epidemic, the government has established the Ghana AIDS Commission which coordinates efforts amongst NGO's, international organizations and other parties to support the education about and treatment of aids throughout Ghana. In particular, the United States, European nations and the United Nations have supplied aid to help alleviate HIV/AIDS issues in Ghana.
Prevalence.
The HIV/AIDS elimination in Ghana seems to be progressing rapidly. The Government of Ghana estimated the number of adults and children living with HIV as of 2010 at 230,000 and prevalence at 1.3% in 2012. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated the HIV prevalence in adults to be 0.9% at the end of 2012, with an estimated 200,000 people living with HIV/AIDS."Health Profile: Ghana". 
Ghana’s system of HIV surveillance for women attending antenatal clinics has functioned well since its establishment in 1994. Sentinel surveys of 21 antenatal clinic sites in 2002 reported a range from 3.2% to 9.1% in prevalence among pregnant women. In 2002, the median HIV prevalence at four of these sites in Accra was 4.1%; elsewhere in Ghana, prevalence in antenatal clinics ranged from 3.2% to 3.4% in 2002.
HIV prevalence is highest in the Eastern Region of Ghana and lowest in the northern regions of the country. Prevalence is generally higher in urban areas, in mining and border towns, and along main transportation routes. HIV-1 accounts for 92% of HIV cases in Ghana; another 7.4% of reported HIV cases are dual infections with HIV-1 and HIV-2. Only 0.5% of HIV cases were exclusively HIV-2. Heterosexual intercourse is the mode of transmission for about 80% of HIV cases, with mother-to-child transmission accounting for another 15%. According to the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey, HIV prevalence is very low among most younger age groups, as relatively few are infected during their youth (with the exceptions of infants infected through their mothers). The infection peaks late, compared to other countries, at 35–39 years for women and 40–45 years for men. The infection levels are highest in middle income and middle educational groups, with the poor and unemployed less affected
Though evidence is still being gathered for making program decisions, some populations thought to be at risk include sex workers, transport workers, prisoners, sexual partners of people living with HIV/AIDS, and men who have sex with men and their female sexual partners. HIV prevalence among uniformed services is not fully established.
Approximately 9,600 children under age 15 are living with HIV/AIDS, and at the end of 2003, nearly 170,000 children under age 17 had lost one or both parents to AIDS. At that time only a few thousand of these children had received assistance such as food aid, health care, protection services, or educational or psychosocial support.
There is widespread knowledge of HIV and modes of transmission—with awareness of AIDS estimated at greater than 95%—although fear and stigmatization of HIV-positive people remain high. The populace are at risk of further HIV spread for a variety of reasons, including engaging in transactional sex, marriage and gender relations that disadvantage women and make them vulnerable to HIV, inaccurate perceptions of personal risk, and stigma and discrimination toward people living with HIV/AIDS.
National response.
The Ghana AIDS Commission is the coordinating body for all HIV/AIDS-related activities in the country; it oversees an expanded response to the epidemic and is responsible for carrying out the National Strategic Framework on HIV/AIDS for the 2001–2005 period. The Ghana AIDS Commission is currently reviewing the National Strategic Framework II, covering 2006–2010, with stakeholders, and bilateral and multilateral partners. The frameworks set targets for reducing new HIV infections, address service delivery issues and individual and societal vulnerability, and promote the establishment of a multisectoral, multidisciplinary approach to HIV/AIDS programs.
Ghana’s goal is to prevent new HIV infections as well as to mitigate the socioeconomic and psychological effects of HIV/AIDS on individuals, communities, and the nation. The first national strategic plan focused on five themes: prevention of new infections; care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS; creation of an enabling environment for a national response; decentralization of implementation of HIV/AIDS activities through institutional arrangements; research; and monitoring and evaluation of programs.
The second national strategic plan, currently in process, focuses on: policy, advocacy, and enabling environment; coordination and management of the decentralized response; mitigating the economic, sociocultural, and legal impacts; prevention and Behavior Change Communication; treatment, care, and support; research and surveillance; and monitoring and evaluation.
Multilateral and bilateral partners, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and civil society organizations actively participate in the national response, with more than 2,500 community-based organizations and NGOs reportedly implementing HIV/AIDS activities in Ghana. Substantial funding for HIV/AIDS activities is received from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Japan, Canada, and United Nations agencies. Activities include the five-country, World-Bank-led HIV/AIDS Abidjan-Lagos Transport Corridor project; the World Bank-funded Treatment Acceleration Program for public-private partnership in HIV/AIDS management; the World Health Organization (WHO) 3X5 initiative; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM).
Following the Declaration of Commitment of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS in 2001, the Government of Ghana earmarked 15% of its health budget for HIV/AIDS activities, and all ministries were asked to create an HIV/AIDS budget line. Available funding to support Ghana’s response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic includes about $6.7 million from GFATM; about $12 million from multilateral partners, including the World Bank; and about $8 million from bilateral donors. Based on the level of funding already committed by the national government and its donors, WHO estimates a $5 to $12.8 million funding gap for HIV/AIDS activities in Ghana for the period 2004–2005.

HIV/AIDS in Guinea

Prevalence.
HIV is spreading quickly in Guinea. The estimated total number of adults and children living with HIV in 2003 was 140,000 (with a low estimate of 51,000 and a high estimate of 360,000), up from an estimated 110,000 in 2001, indicating an increase in adult prevalence of 0.4% (from 2.8 to 3.2%) over the two-year period.
HIV prevalence varies by region. Surveillance surveys conducted among women seeking antenatal care in 2001 and 2002 show higher rates of HIV in urban areas than in rural areas (3.2 vs. 2.6%, respectively). Prevalence was highest in Conakry (5%) and in the cities of the Forest Guinea region (7%) bordering Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
HIV is spread primarily through multiple-partner heterosexual intercourse. Men and women are at nearly equal risk for HIV, with young people aged 15 to 24 most vulnerable. Surveillance figures from 2001–2002 show high rates among commercial sex workers (42%), active military personnel (6.6%), truck drivers and bush taxi drivers (7.3%), miners (4.7%), and adults with tuberculosis (8.6%).
Several factors are fueling the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Guinea. They include unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, illiteracy, endemic poverty, unstable borders, refugee migration, lack of civic responsibility, and scarce medical care and public services.
National response.
As one of the poorest nations in the world, Guinea faces daunting social, economic, and political problems. Until 2002, the national response to the epidemic was weak, primarily because of a lack of governmental commitment, poor leadership, and inadequate resources. Since then, high-level political commitment and will to fight HIV/AIDS have been strengthened, but little money has been allocated to health, and most government-backed projects are funded primarily with external financing.
The National AIDS Control Program was reorganized in 2002, partly to meet the requirements for receipt of a $20 million loan from the World Bank to fight HIV/AIDS. Government response to the epidemic is now directed through the Office of the Prime Minister. The National AIDS Commission directs general activities, whereas the National Program for the Care, Support, and Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS manages clinical activities (i.e., overseeing surveillance and testing, and providing counseling, care, and support to individuals living with HIV/AIDS).
About half of the government ministries have designed action plans to address HIV/AIDS in their work. The Ministry of Communication, for example, is charged with managing Behavior Change Communication efforts, and the Ministry of Planning supervises epidemiological research.

HIV/AIDS in Kenya

Kenya has a severe, generalized HIV epidemic, but in recent years, the country has experienced a notable decline in HIV prevalence, attributed in part to significant behavioral change and increased access to ART. National adult HIV prevalence is estimated to have fallen from 10 percent in the late 1990s to about 6.1 percent in 2005. Women face considerably higher risk of HIV infection than men, and also experience a shorter life expectancy due to HIV/AIDS. The 7th edition of AIDS in Kenya reports an HIV prevalence rate of eight percent in adult women and four percent in adult men. Populations in Kenya especially at risk include injecting drug users and people in prostitution, whose prevalence rates are estimated at 53 percent and 27 percent, respectively.
Kenya is in a transitional period, with a government seeking to restructure many elements of the state. This context offers clear opportunities, but also many constraints for controlling HIV/AIDS. Human capacity development is a major concern and all partners are working to improve capabilities and human resource management systems to enable people to respond effectively to HIV/AIDS. Kenya has a large number of qualified, unemployed health care workers. The key to success will be developing effective mechanisms to engage these trained staff. In addition, efforts to employ auxiliary staff, such as adherence counselors and outreach workers, are a high priority. Treatment literacy is very low, which contributes to the high levels of stigma among health workers and the general population. Furthermore, for those who are receiving ART, systematic monitoring and evaluation is lacking.

HIV/AIDS in Lesotho

AIDS constitutes an alarming threat to Lesotho and its people, and HIV/AIDS is not the only barrier to Lesotho’s economic development. Land degradation, capacity depletion, and economic decline are major obstacles to short- and long-term responses to humanitarian and development needs.
Prevalence.
HIV sentinel surveillance data from 2003 indicate that the epidemic in Lesotho is now the third highest prevalence in the world. Survey findings show that the 25–29 age group was most affected, with prevalence of 39.1%; for the 15–19 and 20–24 age groups, median prevalence was 14.4% and 30.1%, respectively. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), overall adult prevalence is estimated to be 28.9%. In the 2003 HIV Sentinel Survey Report, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) estimated that there were 100,000 children under 15 in the 10 districts of Lesotho who had lost one or both parents to AIDS.
National response.
The Government of Lesotho has taken concrete actions to address the epidemic through the declaration of HIV/AIDS as a national disaster, development of the National AIDS Strategic Plan, and the establishment of the Lesotho AIDS Programme Coordinating Authority (LAPCA) under the Prime Minister’s Office. The LAPCA was set up in 2001 to coordinate the multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS, but several factors have hindered it in fulfilling its strategic role, thus undermining its effectiveness and adversely affecting the national response. In 2005, the government passed a bill establishing the semi-autonomous National AIDS Commission (NAC) and National AIDS Secretariat (NAS) to coordinate and support strategies. Lesotho is in the process of drafting the next HIV strategy, for the period 2005 to 2008.
Lesotho has committed itself to the World Health Organization goal of having 28,000 people on antiretroviral therapy by the end of 2005, and in May 2004 opened its first comprehensive HIV/AIDS center to provide antiretroviral therapy. Supported largely by donors; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund); and international private organizations; local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) have provided the mainstay of the response to HIV/AIDS in the country, especially in the area of community mobilization. Most of these operations are small and localized to specific geographical areas in urban centers. The biggest challenge remains the establishment of national networks and civil society organizations on HIV/AIDS, most importantly among people living with HIV/AIDS and within the NGO network. A number of private companies are implementing successful HIV and AIDS workplace programs, such as LSP, the brewery, and some security companies. The apparel and textile industry, Lesotho's biggest private employer, has established an innovative sector-wide and comprehensive HIV workplace program. It is a public private partnership with the Government of Lesotho, buyers, employer and employee associations and donors. To date (May 2009) ALAFA (the Apparel Lesotho Alliance to fight AIDS) provides close to 90% of the 42,000 employees with prevention services, and up to 80% with treatment services.

Ambrosia eriocentra

Ambrosia eriocentra is a species of ragweed known by the common names woolly bursage and woollyfruit burr ragweed. 
It is native to the southwestern United States where it grows in the deserts and surrounding ridges up to about 1700 meters in elevation. This is a rounded shrub reaching over 1.5 meters in maximum height. The stems are brownish gray in color, with young twigs coated in light woolly fibers and older branches bare. Leaves are lance-shaped and up to 9 centimeters long, not counting the winged petioles. The leaves have rolled lobed or toothed edges. As in other ragweeds, the inflorescence has a few staminate (male) flower heads next to several single-flowered pistillate heads. The fruit is a green burr with long, silky white hairs and several hair-tufted sharp spines. The burr is around a centimeter long.

Le Palace

Le Palace is a Paris theatre located at 8, rue du Faubourg-Montmartre in the 9th arrondissement. It is best known for its years as a nightclub where fashion, music, and underground culture intersected in a mythical blend. 
Created by impresario Fabrice Emaer in 1978, intellectuals, actors, designers, and American and European jetsetters adored the place for its flamboyant DJ Guy Cuevas, extravagant theme parties and performances, and Emaer's rule-breaking mix of clubgoers that threw together rich and poor, gay and straight, black and white.
After Emaer's death in 1985, Le Palace changed hands and names several times before reopening in 2008 as a theater and concert space of the same name.
History: The Palace Theater.
Constructed in the 17th century, the building on rue on Faubourg Montmartre already had a modern history as theater and dance hall before Fabrice Emaer turned it into one of the hottest nightclubs in Paris. 
Baptized Le Palace as early as 1912, by 1923 it served as a music hall hosted by Oscar Dufrenne and Henri Varna who had already directed le Concert Mayol, l'Empire, le Moncey Music-Hall and the Bouffes du Nord. The two changed the name to Eden en Palace in 1923, and in collaboration with the London Palace, had a long run engaging artists like dancer and singer Harry Pilcer and musical clown Grock.
In 1931, Oscar Dufrenne took the bold step of changing the theater into a cinema, a move which came to an end when his nude corpse was discovered on site in 1933, inspiring rumors of rough trade gone bad. Shortly afterwards, his partner Henry Varna changed the space back into a music hall which he called the "Alcazar." It became a cinema again in 1946, recovering its original name and gradually fading from view. 
The decrepit building was finally acquired by writer and theater director Pierre Laville in 1975. He began producing experimental theater there, and came to the attention of then Minister of Culture, Michel Guy, who used the space for his Festival d'Automne (Autumn Festival). 
When impresario Fabrice Emaer decided to open a place large enough to rival Studio 54 in New York, it was Michel Guy who suggested he buy Le Palace.
Trial Runs: Le Pimm's, Le Sept.
Fabrice Emaer (1935-1983) was already a proven success when he opened Le Palace. He created Le Pimm's, the premier gay club on Saint-Anne Street in 1964. And in 1968, while other young Parisians were out on the streets throwing cobblestones, he took over le Sept down the block. 
At Club Sept, he was trying to do something totally different from the pick-up club Le Pimm's. The "7" had a restaurant on the ground floor with a small dance floor in the basement simply decorated with mirrors on the walls and a ceiling with multicolored lights that flashed with the music. 
The focus was dancing and the Sept quickly became "the epicenter of disco" in part because Emaer hired a young Cuban DJ Guy Cuevas, to work the turntable. Cuevas was largely responsible for introducing Paris to funk and soul playing the O'Jays, Billy Paul, Teddy Pendergrass and Marvin Gaye.
While some attributed Emaer's success largely to Cuevas who had the crowd pressing at its doors and the packing the dance floor, Emaer also accomplished something new with the clientele. He mixed the "jet set" with kids that just wanted to dance, hets with homos, and artists and intellectuals with anyone who had an interesting look.
The combination of excellent music and clientele worked. And after a visit to Studio 54 in New York, Emaer returned with even greater ambitions to create a space that was more than a club, but an experience.
Emaer's Palace.
Le Palace "wasn't a club like the others, it gathered together in an original place pleasures ordinarily scattered: that of the lovingly preserved theater, performing the gaze; the excitement of the Modern, the exploration of new visual sensations due to new technologies; the joy of the dance, the charm of possible encounters. All of that together offers something incredibly ancient which is called the Celebration, and which is entirely different from Entertainment: a whole range of sensations designed to make people happy during the space of a night. The novelty was that impression of synthesis, of totality, of complexity: I am in a place which is sufficient unto itself. 
—Roland Barthes, "Au Palace ce soir", 1978. 
Delighted with the Palace's decrepit structure which would allow him not just an enormous disco, but the accoutrements of a traditional theater space with stages and an enormous balcony, Fabrice Emaer ordered important construction work, restoring the architecturally classified building, including the decor of the '30s. The colossal expenses which were to be a lasting burden on the future of the club, but in the short term the results were impressive.
Everything was excessive at the Palace. The club opened onto a long hallway that descended into a foyer that guided clubbers to the main room. It had a bar, tables, some couches and a huge dance floor facing a stage. On the first floor, a second bar gave access to another floor with another bar, in addition to nooks along the balcony. From the beginning, the particularity of the Palace was that it offered several zones reserved for VIPs, which influenced the movements of club-goers and the general circulation of the place.
Every detail was calculated. The careful interior design extended to the waiters who were dressed in flamboyant red and gold costumes designed by the couturier Thierry Mugler. And on opening night, 1 March 1978, the Palace set the tone for the future by offering an extravagant spectacle in which Grace Jones sang La Vie en Rose surrounded by dry ice and shining roses while perched atop a pink Harley Davidson. 
To complete the dramatic experience at the club, the Palace, not content with one laser, had three, along with descending disco balls, and installations by some of the time's most extravagant sculptors and stage designers. There were different lighting effects every night that were so spectaculor dancers would stop mid-gesture to watch what was going on.
Emaer also played careful attention to the music.
Guy Cuevas had followed Emaer to the Palace, and there his selection was the same: flamboyant. For the first time people danced all the time, not leaving the dance floor except for a quick trip to the toilets or the bar. The music was so sensational that it gave the impression that the Palace was a trampoline in the middle of the Atlantic : Let's All Chant by the Michael Zager Band was a hit in France at the same time as the U.S. Suddenly dancing became a lifestyle.
Completing the picture was Emaer's talent for creating a compelling crowd. At the entry, Edwige and Paquita Paquin were instructed to mix rich and poor, gay and straight, black and white, the bourgeois, even punk. Above all they looked for attitude and an interesting look.
Among the regulars or its most famous visitors (to name just a few) were Alain Pacadis, of the newspaper "Libération" who frequently evoked le Palace and its regulars in his chronicles; couturier Karl Lagerfeld; semiotician Roland Barthes, professor at the Collège de France; singer Mick Jagger; American artist Andy Warhol; journalist Frédéric Mitterrand; decorator Andrée Putman; movie producer and illustrator Jean-Paul Goude; model and singer Grace Jones; couturier Kenzo; couturier Yves Saint Laurent; the CEO of Yves Saint Laurent and friend of François Mitterrand, Pierre Bergé; actress Alice Sapritch; impersonator of celebrities Thierry Le Luron; publicist and art gallery owner Cyril Putman.
Fashion designers organized theme nights and balls. There were live concerts, fashion shows and private parties. Prince held his first concert there. And in 1980, in the basement, Fabrice Emaer opened beneath Le Palace a private restaurant/discothèque, Le Privilège, reserved for the jet set and for princes and princesses of the night for whom the excessive social diversity of the Palace broke rules. 
The decoration of the place was entrusted to Gérard Garouste, the creation of the furniture to Elisabeth Garouste.
All that ended when Fabrice Emaer died in 1983.
After Emaer.
Le Palace was taken up by ex-associates of Fabrice Emaer who were burdened with his accumulated debts. On several occasions, drug trafficking led to the administrative closure of the place for periods of three to six months, further weakening the financial situation. 
Nevertheless, le Palace of the years 1983/1989 gave birth to the Parisian infatuation with House Music with the parties of Jean-Claude Lacreze or of La Nicole (Nicolas), but specially the Pyramid parties around 1987, organized by the English of S-Express. The Australian artist Leigh Bowery was frequently invited there. On 15 July 1987 Leigh Bowery flew over to Paris with the cult British band You You You to host their concert at Le Palace. Also, the Gay Tea Dance that originated with the openly gay Emaer received two to three thousand participants each Sunday afternoon.
In 1992, Régine herself, former 'rival' of the night of Fabrice Emaer, "Queen of the Parisian Night", tried to take over the site, followed in 1994 by the couple David and Cathy Guetta who tried to relaunch it with le Privilège, renovated and renamed Kitkat. The decorations of Garouste disappeared.
The place closed definitively in 1996, and was occupied by squatters for several years. In 2007, the brothers Alil and Hazis Vardar, Belgians of Albanian origin purchased the hall with the money of Francis and Chantal Lemaire, proprietors of Radio Contact in Belgium. The Vardar brothers already owned Comédie République and Grande Comédie, Parisian halls with 200 and 400 seats which were filled every night because of good comedies. After its remodeling, they reopened Le Palace (970 seats) to offer, since 2007, popular comedies, one-man shows, and television broadcasts.

HIV/AIDS in Madagascar

Prevalence.
Madagascar is among very few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with an opportunity to slow the HIV epidemic and avert the socioeconomic destruction that is evident in high-prevalence areas. With the internal and external migration of workforce to keep up with the labor needs of these economic zones, Madagascar will be faced with an increased problem containing HIV, which would have a negative effect on the economic and development efforts. If these problems are not proactively addressed, Madagascar could actually reverse the benefits brought to the country through the period of economic prosperity and increase its health and social burden.
Even though low, the HIV prevalence in Madagascar is increasing, as seen among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics; prevalence in this population rose from 0.064% in 1995 to 1.1% in 2003. Madagascar’s rapid increase in HIV prevalence is likely influenced by a variety of conditions, including low literacy, widespread poverty, limited access to health and social services, high rates of partner change, and an increasingly transient population. Madagascar also has some of the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the world. Services for prevention and treatment of HIV, such as counseling and testing and antiretroviral therapy, are being offered, but only a small portion of the Malagasy in need currently benefit from these interventions. At the end of 2003, Madagascar had only 13 sites offering counseling and testing services to 2,082 clients annually. Treatment for HIV is still limited in Madagascar, with only one site in the country currently offering antiretroviral therapy at the end of 2003. As of September 2004, only 30 of an estimated 17,000 adults in need of treatment for advanced HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy.
National response.
Efforts by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and other donors to garner the commitment of the Government of Madagascar to HIV prevention and treatment have paid off. One of the primary supports to addressing Madagascar’s emerging epidemic is the powerful political commitment at the highest levels of the new government. Just after his inauguration in 2002, President Marc Ravalomanana publicly established his leadership in HIV prevention. He chairs the nation’s multisectoral HIV/AIDS program National de Lutte contre le SIDA (CNLS). President Ravalomanana is committed to aggressively fighting the spread of HIV, and the government has taken bold steps to control the spread of the infection. The National Strategic Framework was approved by the government in December 2001 and was adjusted following the first national seroprevalence survey in 2003. The country’s overall strategy focuses on behavior change and prevention, treatment of HIV and STIs, and AIDS education.
With the guidance of USAID and other partners, the Government of Madagascar is actively responding to gaps in its HIV/AIDS program. The government will use $13.4 million from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to expand current interventions by opening 40 new counseling and testing sites in 2005 and will reinforce existing HIV-prevention measures by ensuring use of universal precaution measures, reinforcing blood transfusion safety, and providing free condoms in public health care facilities. New interventions will include measures to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission in 11 districts and the provision of psychosocial and community medical care for about 500 to 750 persons living with HIV/AIDS. The program will also lay the groundwork for the care of the estimated 30,000 children orphaned by AIDS.

Lincoyan

Lincoyan (c. 1519 Arauco - 1560 Cañete) was the Mapuche toqui that succeeded Ainavillo in 1550 after the defeat at the Battle of Penco. He tried to stop Pedro de Valdivia from invading and establishing fortresses and cities in their lands between 1551 and 1553 at the beginning of the Arauco War with no success. In 1551 he attacked Valdivia on the banks of the Andalien, but the neighboring fort resisted his assaults. During part of that year and in 1552 he continued fighting against Valdivia along Cauten River. In 1553, he was replaced by Caupolicán, but he was given the command of a division. In this year he took part in the capture of the fortresses of Arauco and Tucapel. Soon after this battle he defeated a strong Spanish force that came to protect Imperial. He followed Caupolicán in all his victories and in all his battles until the death of that chief in 1558. Afterward he continued the war against the Spaniards until he was killed in the Battle of Cañete.

HIV/AIDS in Mali

Infection rates of HIV/AIDS in Mali are estimated to be under 2%, low in relation to some parts of Africa. Rates are higher among childbearing age women, and national education campaigns have targeted the general population since the late 1990s, as government and international organizations have been concerned that Malians may be vulnerable to the spread of the pandemic. However the low infection rates are most likely deceptive; the problem in attempting to estimate infection rates is that voluntary testing is rare. Women who give birth in a hospital are automatically tested, but others in the general population rarely present themselves for testing. 
Since 2002, the Supreme National Council for AIDS (HCNLS) has coordinated educational campaigns around sexual activity and condom use to stem HIV infection. Condom use remains low by international standards.
Prevalence.
The first cases of HIV/AIDS in Mali were reported in 1985. While the adult HIV prevalence was still relatively low at 1.7% according to the 2001 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), it is estimated that HIV prevalence in the general population could triple by 2010 if appropriate prevention measures are not taken immediately.
Vulnerability to HIV infection in Mali is associated with a variety of factors, such as poverty, poor health conditions, certain cultural practices, and low literacy levels. Cultural factors related to HIV vulnerability may include male dominance of women, the early onset of sexual activity among females, and polygamy, while poverty may result in increased prostitution. In addition to polygyny, another cultural factor widely accepted among much of the population is multiple sex partners outside of marriage. migration is also a significant contributor to HIV infection, as HIV prevalence in neighboring countries such as Côte d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso is substantially higher than in Mali. Political and social troubles in countries like Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are also believed to contribute to increased HIV transmission across borders.
Recorded rates of HIV infection are higher in Malian women than in men, particularly among pregnant women 25–29 years of age, in whom prevalence is almost 5%. The estimated ratio of HIV-infected young women to young men is 4.5:1. Low condom use and a high prevalence of sexually transmitted disease and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are important contributing factors for HIV transmission in Mali. Condom use by young males 15–24 years of age is approximately 30%, but among young females it is as low as 14%. Condom use is also low among other vulnerable populations, such as military personnel, truck drivers, and vendors. A recent survey found that only 12% of women vendors in Bamako (with an estimated HIV seroprevalence of 6.7%) reported using a condom with their last non-regular partner. 
Some people still do not believe that AIDS is real, citing rumors that it is a myth propagated by people in Western/European countries who don't want Africans to have more children.
National response.
The commitment of the Government of Mali to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment is evident. The National AIDS Program was restructured in 2002, creating the Supreme National Council for AIDS (HCNLS), headed by the President of Mali; in 2004, an Executive Secretariat was added to the HCNLS to coordinate multisectoral HIV/AIDS-related programming. The National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Control (2001–2005) was developed, and planning for a new strategic plan (2005–2009) has begun; in March 2004, the government signed a national declaration of HIV/AIDS policy.

HIV/AIDS in Senegal

Senegal has a low prevalence of HIV, at under 1% of the adult population.
Overview.
Although Sengal is a very poor country, it has maintained a low HIV prevalence. With a “concentrated” epidemic, the general population in Senegal has remained relatively free of AIDS, though vulnerable populations have significantly higher prevalence; among commercial sex workers, for example, prevalence is around 17%.
Senegal’s success at maintaining a low overall prevalence has been attributed to the confluence of a number of factors, including strong political leadership, early involvement and leadership among religious leaders, conservative cultural norms regarding sexual practices, and a comprehensive strategic approach implemented early in the epidemic. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Senegal’s success at maintaining a low prevalence among the general population can be attributed to the country’s rapid and consistent implementation of several measures such as: reinforcement of the national blood supply (which had been systematically tested for syphilis and hepatitis since the 1970 in order to prevent HIV transmission through blood transfusions); the provision of appropriate equipment and personnel trained in HIV testing to regional and national blood banks; HIV education programs; registration and regular medical checkups for commercial sex workers (harm reduction measures which allow access to condoms and health services in this high risk population); promotion of condom use in the general population (dissemination of millions of condoms through social marketing programs to the general population and free distribution to high-risk populations). 
Senegal's policies are considered to be successful in the control of the spread of HIV. Challenges to continued success include population movement across borders, high HIV prevalence among commercial sex workers, and the need to reach young people approaching sexual debut.
National response.
Senegal responded rapidly to the first emergence of HIV/AIDS in the mid-1980s, establishing the Programme National de Lutte contre le SIDA (National Program for the Fight against AIDS) in 1986, renamed as the Conseil National de Lutte contre le SIDA (National Council for the Fight against AIDS) in 2002. The national program quickly undertook significant measures to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission, including condom promotion; sentinel surveillance to determine the scope and spread of the epidemic; confidential counseling and testing; education of sex workers; and integration of HIV into sex education.
From the start of the epidemic, the government worked actively to involve religious and community leaders in HIV/AIDS prevention. In 1995, a national conference resulted in a proclamation of support for HIV prevention activities and a partnership between health care providers and Muslim and Christian religious leaders in the fight against AIDS. This approach combines outreach programs targeting high-risk populations with condom promotion and other prevention efforts, while simultaneously, through the participation of religious leaders and faith-based organizations, reinforcing the traditional sexual norms that have protected Senegal from a widespread HIV/AIDS epidemic. Muslim religious leaders, in particular, have been at the forefront of the national response, preaching about HIV/AIDS in mosques and incorporating AIDS education into religious teaching programs. Both Muslim and Christian organizations provide care and psychosocial services and promote tolerance.
The government’s 2002–2006 strategy continues to emphasize a multisectoral approach that includes the participation of government ministries, the private sector, and religious and civil society organizations, as well as persons living with HIV/AIDS. Priority action areas include prevention, blood safety, sexually transmitted infections, mother-to-child transmission, and social mobilization. A sentinel surveillance survey conducted from late 2004 to early 2005 will provide new information on the state of the epidemic.

India's three-stage nuclear power programme

India's three-stage nuclear power programme was formulated by Dr. Homi Bhabha in the 1950s to secure the country’s long term energy independence, through the use of uranium and thorium reserves found in the monazite sands of coastal regions of South India. The ultimate focus of the programme is on enabling the thorium reserves of India to be utilised in meeting the country's energy requirements. 
Thorium is particularly attractive for India, as it has only around 1–2% of the global uranium reserves, but one of the largest shares of global thorium reserves at about 25% of the world's known thorium reserves.
The country published about twice the number of papers on thorium as its nearest competitors, during each of the years from 2002 to 2006.
The Indian nuclear establishment estimates that the country could produce 500 GWe for at least four centuries using just the country’s economically extractable thorium reserves.
, the first stage consisting of the pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWR) is near completion of its planned goals, the second stage consisting of fast breeder reactors (FBR) is poised to go into operation within one year, and the third stage consisting of advanced heavy water reactors (AHWR), as one among several technology options, is slated to begin construction so that its commissioning can be done by 2020. The recent Indo-US Nuclear Deal and the NSG waiver, which ended more than three decades of international isolation of the Indian civil nuclear programme, have created many hitherto unexplored alternatives for the success of the three-stage nuclear power programme.
Origin and rationale.
Dr. Homi Bhabha conceived of the three-stage nuclear programme as a way to develop nuclear energy by working around India's limited uranium resources.
Thorium itself is not a fissile material, and thus cannot undergo fission to produce energy. Instead, it must first be converted into the fissile isotope uranium-233 by transmutation in a reactor fueled by other fissile materials. The first two stages, natural uranium-fueled heavy water reactors and plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactors, are intended to generate sufficient fissile material from India's limited uranium resources, so that all its vast thorium reserves can be fully utilised in the third stage of thermal breeder reactors.
Bhabha summarised the rationale for the three-stage approach as follows: 
In November 1954, Bhabha presented the three-stage plan for national development,
at the conference on “Development of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes” which was also attended by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. 
Four years later in 1958, the Indian government formally adopted the three-stage plan.
Indian energy resource base was estimated to be capable of yielding a total electric power output of the order shown in the table below.
Indian government recognised that thorium was a source that could provide power to the Indian people for the long term.
Fuel reserves and research capability.
According to a report issued by the IAEA, India has limited uranium reserves, consisting of approximately 54,636 tonnes of “reasonably assured resources”, 25,245 tonnes of “estimated additional resources”, 15,488 tonnes of “undiscovered conventional resources, and 17,000 tonnes of “speculative resources”. According to NPCIL, these reserves are only sufficient to generate about 10 GWe for about 40 years.
In July 2011, it was reported that a four-year-long mining survey done at Tummalapalle mine in Kadapa district near Hyderabad had yielded confirmed reserve figure of 49,000 tonnes with a potential that it could rise to 150,000 tonnes.
This was a rise from an earlier estimate of 15,000 tonnes for that area.
Although India has only around 1–2% of the global uranium reserves, thorium reserves are bigger; around 12–33% of global reserves, according to IAEA and US Geological Survey.
Several in-depth independent studies put Indian thorium reserves at 30% of the total world thorium reserves.
As per official estimates shared in the country's Parliament in August 2011, the country can obtain 846,477 tonnes of thorium from 963,000 tonnes of ThO2, which in turn can be obtained from 10.7 million tonnes of monazite occurring in beaches and river sands in association with other heavy metals. Indian monazite contains about 9–10% ThO2. 
The 846,477 tonne figure compares with the earlier estimates for India, made by IAEA and US Geological Survey of 319,000 tonnes and 290,000 to 650,000 tonnes respectively. The 800,000 tonne figure is given by other sources as well.
It was further clarified in the country’s Parliament on 21 March 2012 that, “Out of nearly 100 deposits of the heavy minerals, at present only 17 deposits containing about 4 million tonnes of monazite have been identified as exploitable. Mineable reserves are ~70% of identified exploitable resources. Therefore, about 225,000 tonnes of thorium metal is available for nuclear power programme.”
India is generally considered as the leader of thorium based research in the world.
It is also by far the most committed nation as far as the use of thorium fuel is concerned, and no other country has done as much neutron physics work on thorium.
The country published about twice the number of papers on thorium as its nearest competitors during each of the years from 2002 to 2006.
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) had the highest number of publications in the thorium area, across all research institutions in the world during the period 1982-2004. During this same period, India ranks an overall second behind the United States in the research output on Thorium.
Analysis shows that majority of the authors involved in thorium research publications appear to be from India.
According to Siegfried Hecker, a former director (1986–1997) of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the U.S., "India has the most technically ambitious and innovative nuclear energy programme in the world. The extent and functionality of its nuclear experimental facilities are matched only by those in Russia and are far ahead of what is left in the US."
Stage I – pressurised heavy water reactor.
In the first stage of the programme, natural uranium fuelled pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWR) produce electricity while generating plutonium-239 as by-product. PHWRs was a natural choice for implementing the first stage because it had the most efficient reactor design in terms of uranium utilisation, and the existing Indian infrastructure in the 1960s allowed for quick adoption of the PHWR technology.
India correctly calculated that it would be easier to create heavy water production facilities (required for PHWRs) than uranium enrichment facilities (required for LWRs).
Natural uranium contains only 0.7% of the fissile isotope uranium-235. Most of the remaining 99.3% is uranium-238 which is not fissile but can be converted in a reactor to the fissile isotope plutonium-239. Heavy water (deuterium oxide, D 2O) is used as moderator and coolant.
Indian uranium reserves are capable of generating a total power capacity of 420 GWe-years, but in order to ensure that existing plants get a lifetime supply of uranium, it becomes necessary to limit the number of PHWRs fueled exclusively by indigenous uranium reserves. US analysts calculate this limit as being slightly over 13 GW in capacity.
Several other sources estimate that the known reserves of natural uranium in the country permit only about 10 GW of capacity to be built through indigenously fueled PHWRs.
The three-stage programme explicitly incorporates this limit as the upper cut off of the first stage, beyond which PHWRs are not planned to be built.
Almost the entire existing base of Indian nuclear power (4780 MW) is composed of first stage PHWRs, with the exception of the two Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) units at Tarapur.
The installed capacity of Kaiga station is now 880 MW, making it the third largest after Tarapur (1400 MW) and Rawatbhata (1180 MW).
The remaining three power stations at Kakrapar, Kalpakkam and Narora all have 2 units of 220 MW, thus contributing 440 MW each to the grid.
The 2 units of 700 MWe each (PHWRs) that are under construction at both Kakrapar
and Rawatbhata, and the one planned for Banswara
would also come under the first stage of the programme, totalling a further addition of 4200 MW. These additions will bring the total power capacity from the first stage PHWRs to near the total planned capacity of 10 GW called for by the three-stage power programme.
Capital costs of PHWRs is in the range of Rs. 6 to 7 crore ($1.2 to $1.4 million) per MW, coupled with a designed plant life of 40 years. Time required for construction has improved over time and is now at about 5 years. Tariffs of the operating plants are in the range of Rs. 1.75 to 2.80 per unit, depending on the life of the reactor. In the year 2007–08 the average tariff was Rs.2.28. The tariffs of new plants to be set up, both indigenous and imported, are expected to be about Rs. 2.50 in the year 2015 (at 2007 prices).
Stage II – fast breeder reactor.
In the second stage, fast breeder reactors (FBRs) would use a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel made from plutonium-239, recovered by reprocessing spent fuel from the first stage, and natural uranium. In FBRs, plutonium-239 undergoes fission to produce energy, while the uranium-238 present in the mixed oxide fuel transmutes to additional plutonium-239. Thus, the Stage II FBRs are designed to "breed" more fuel than they consume. Once the inventory of plutonium-239 is built up thorium can be introduced as a blanket material in the reactor and transmuted to uranium-233 for use in the third stage.
The surplus plutonium bred in each fast reactor can be used to set up more such reactors, and thus grow the Indian civil nuclear power capacity till the point where the third stage reactors using thorium as fuel can be brought online, which is forecasted as being possible once 50 GW of nuclear power capacity has been achieved.
The uranium in the first stage PHWRs that yield 29 EJ of energy in the once-through fuel cycle, can be made to yield between 65 and 128 times more energy through multiple cycles in fast breeder reactors.
The design of the country's first fast breeder, called Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), was done by Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR). Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Ltd (Bhavini), a public sector company under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), has been given the responsibility to build the fast breeder reactors in India.
The construction of this PFBR at Kalpakkam was due to be completed in 2012. It is not yet complete. A start date in 2015 has been suggested.
In addition, the country proposes to undertake the construction of four FBRs as part of the 12th Five Year Plan spanning 2012–17, thus targeting 2500 MW from the five reactors.
One of these five reactors is planned to be operated with metallic fuel instead of oxide fuel, since the design will have the flexibility to accept metallic fuel, although the reference design is for oxide fuel.
Indian government has already allotted Rs.250 crore for pre-project activities for two more 500 MW units, although the location is yet to be finalised.
Doubling time.
Doubling time refers to the time required to extract as output, double the amount of fissile fuel, which was fed as input into the breeder reactors.
This metric is critical for understanding the time durations that are unavoidable while transitioning from the second stage to the third stage of Bhabha’s plan, because building up a sufficiently large fissile stock is essential to the large deployment of the third stage. In Bhabha's 1958 papers on role of thorium, he pictured a doubling time of 5–6 years for breeding U-233 in the Th–U233 cycle. This estimate has now been revised to 70 years due to technical difficulties that were unforeseen at the time. Despite such setbacks, according to publications done by DAE scientists, the doubling time of fissile material in the fast breeder reactors can be brought down to about 10 years by choosing appropriate technologies with short doubling time.
Another report prepared for U.S. Department of Energy suggests a doubling time of 22 years for oxide fuel, 13 years for carbide fuel and 10 years for metal fuel.
Stage III – thorium based reactors.
A Stage III reactor or an Advanced nuclear power system involves a self-sustaining series of thorium-232-uranium-233 fuelled reactors. This would be a thermal breeder reactor, which in principle can be refueled – after its initial fuel charge – using only naturally occurring thorium. According to the three-stage programme, Indian nuclear energy could grow to about 10 GW through PHWRs fueled by domestic uranium, and the growth above that would have to come from FBRs till about 50GW. 
The third stage is to be deployed only after this capacity has been achieved.
According to replies given in Q&A in the Indian Parliament on two separate occasions, 19 August 2010 and 21 March 2012, large scale thorium deployment is only to be expected “3 – 4 decades after the commercial operation of fast breeder reactors with short doubling time”.
Full exploitation of India’s domestic thorium reserves will likely not occur until after the year 2050.
Parallel approaches.
As there is a long delay before direct thorium utilisation in the three-stage programme, the country is now looking at reactor designs that allow more direct use of thorium in parallel with the sequential three-stage programme.
Three options under consideration are the Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS),
Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) and Compact High Temperature Reactor.
Molten Salt Reactor may also be under consideration based on some recent reports.
Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR)
Of the options, the design for AHWR is ready for deployment. AHWR is a 300 MWe vertical pressure tube type, boiling light water cooled and heavy water moderated reactor, using uranium233–thorium MOX and plutonium–thorium MOX.
It is expected to generate 65% of its power from thorium and can also be configured to accept other fuel types in full core including enriched uranium and uranium–plutonium MOX.
There was a plan for constructing such an AHWR with a plutonium–thorium core combination in 2007.
This AHWR design was sent for an independent pre-licensing design safety review by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), the results of which were deemed satisfactory.
AHWR would offer very little growth for the fuel build up that is essential for wide deployment of the third stage, and perhaps the impact on the accumulated fissile material could even be negative.
The AHWR design that will be taken up for construction is to be fueled with 20% low enriched uranium (LEU) and 80% thorium.
The low enriched uranium (LEU) for this AHWR design is readily available on the world market.
As of November 2011, construction will start after the site is identified in 6 months time. It will take another 18 months to get clearances on regulatory and environmental grounds. Construction is estimated to take six years. If everything goes according to plan, AHWR could be operational in India by the end of this decade.
Linkages with the Indo-US nuclear deal.
Uranium supply imbalance in the 2000s
In spite of the overall adequacy of its uranium reserves, Indian power plants could not get the necessary amount of uranium to function at full capacity in the late 2000s, primarily due to inadequate investments made in the uranium mining and milling capacity resulting from fiscal austerity in the early 1990s.
One study done for U.S. Congress in that time period reaches the conclusion, “India’s current fuel situation means that New Delhi cannot produce sufficient fuel for both its nuclear weapons programme and its projected civil nuclear programme.”
An independent study arrives at roughly the same conclusion, “India’s current uranium production of less than 300 tons/year can meet at most, two-thirds of its needs for civil and military nuclear fuel.”
This uranium shortfall during the deal negotiations was understood by both players to be a temporary aberration that was poised to be resolved with requisite investments in India’s uranium milling infrastructure.
Drivers for the deal from the Indian side.
Speeding up deployment of third stage thorium reactors
It was estimated that after attaining 21 GW from nuclear power by 2020, further growth might require imported uranium. This is problematic because deployment of third stage requires that 50 GW be already established through the first and second stages.
If imported uranium was made available, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) estimated that India could reach 70 GW by 2032 and 275 GW by 2052. In such a scenario, the third stage could be made operational following the fast breeder implementation, and nuclear power capacity could grow to 530 GW.
The estimated stagnation of the nuclear power at about 21GW by 2020 is likely due to the fact that even the short “doubling time” of the breeder reactors is quite slow, on the order of 10–15 years.
Implementing the three-stage programme using the domestic uranium resources alone is feasible, but requires several decades to come to fruition. Imports of fissile material from outside would considerably speed up the programme.
Maintaining nuclear power growth at a rate commensurate with the economic growth requires imported uranium
As per research data, the U238–Pu cycle has the shortest doubling time by a large margin, and that technology’s compounded yearly fissile material growth rate has been calculated as follows, after making some basic assumptions about the operating features of the fast breeder reactors.
Indian power generation capacity has grown at 5.9% per annum in the 25 year period prior to 2006. If Indian economy is to grow at 8–9% for the next 25 year period of 2006 to 2032, total power generation capacity has to increase at 6–7% per annum.
As the fissile material growth rate does not meet this objective, it becomes necessary to look at alternative approaches for obtaining the fissile material. This conclusion is mostly independent of future technical breakthroughs, and complementary to the eventual implementation of the three-stage approach. It was realised that the best way to get access to the requisite fissile material would be through uranium imports, which was not possible without ending India’s nuclear isolation by U.S. and the NSG.
Creating more options for India
U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis argues that the Indo-US nuclear deal is attractive to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, at least in terms of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.
The second option, and perhaps the more interesting one, is that India can choose to access the third stage of thorium reactors by skipping the more difficult second stage of the plan through some appropriately selected parallel approach such as the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, the molten salt reactor, or the various accelerator driven systems.
Stakeholder views on the linkages.
Indian commentators welcomed the opportunity simply because they could see that India would be able end its international isolation on the nuclear front and obtain a de facto acknowledgement of it as a nuclear weapon state to some degree,
in addition to it being able to obtain the uranium that would increase the success potential of its three-stage programme
as well as its efforts to build a “minimum credible nuclear deterrent”.
It was estimated that the power produced by imported reactors could be 50% more expensive than the country’s existing nuclear power cost. However, this was perceived as a minor point in the larger context of the deal.
In a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Under Secretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns’ prepared remarks stated that “India had made this the central issue in the new partnership developing between our countries”.
Indian government proceeded to negotiate and execute the Indo-US Nuclear Deal, which then paved the way for the NSG waiver on international uranium imports to India in 2008.
According to one foreign analyst, the deal could “over time… result in India being weaned away from its… three-phase nuclear program involving FBRs and advanced PHWRs. This would occur should India become confident that it would have assured supplies of relatively cheap natural uranium, including from Australia. Of course, nobody in the Indian nuclear establishment would yet admit to that possibility.”
Anil Kakodkar, then Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, went to the extent of making public, the milder position of keeping the country's indigenous fast breeder programme out of the ambit of international safeguards, saying “in the long run, the energy that will come out from the nuclear fuel resources available in India (from domestic uranium and thorium mines) should always form the larger share of the nuclear energy programme...” and “our strategy should be such that the integrity and autonomy of our being able to develop the three-stage nuclear power programme, be maintained, we cannot compromise that.”
The full demand of the Indian scientists, to have the ability to reprocess plutonium from spent fuel of the imported reactors (goes beyond the defensive position of Kakodkar), appears to have been met in the final deal.
According to the Indian government's official position, India’s indigenous three-stage nuclear power programme is unaffected by the Indo-US Nuclear Deal; “Its full autonomy has been preserved.”
Both right and left-wing political parties opposed the deal in the Parliament. The left feared the deal would make the country subservient to U.S. interests, while the right felt it would limit further nuclear testing.
According to one view within the Indian defence establishment, the deal “has for all practical purposes capped Indian ability to field test and proof high yield nuclear weapons till some time in future (about 20 years) when Indian three-stage nuclear fuel cycle based on Thorium fuel matures into mainstream power production, thus eliminating Indian dependence on imported nuclear fuel from NSG countries or if there is a breakout in global nuclear test moratorium.”
Indian nuclear energy forecasts.
On the basis of the three-stage plan and assuming optimistic development times, some extravagant predictions about nuclear power have been made over the years:
Bhabha announced that there would be 8,000 MW of nuclear power in the country by 1980. As the years progressed, these predictions were to increase. By 1962, the prediction was that nuclear energy would generate 20–25,000 MW by 1987, and by 1969, the AEC predicted that by 2000 there would be 43,500 MW of nuclear generating capacity. All of this was before a single unit of nuclear electricity was produced in the country. Reality was quite different. Installed capacity in 1979–80 was about 600 MW, about 950 MW in 1987, and 2720 MW in 2000.
In 2007, after five decades of sustained and generous government financial support, nuclear power’s capacity was just 3,310 MW, less than 3% of India’s total power generation capacity.
The Integrated Energy Policy of India estimates the share of nuclear power in the total primary energy mix to be between 4% to 6.4% in various scenarios by the year 2031-32. A study by the DAE, estimates that the nuclear energy share will be about 8.6% by the year 2032 and 16.6% by the year 2052. The possible nuclear power capacity beyond the year 2020 has been estimated by DAE is shown in the table.
The 63 GW expected by 2032 will be achieved by setting up 16 indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR), of which ten is to be based on reprocessed uranium. Out of the 63 GW, about 40 GW will be generated through the imported Light Water Reactors (LWR), made possible after the NSG waiver.
Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh stated in 2009 that the nation could generate up to 470 GW of power by 2050 if it managed the three-stage programme well. "This will sharply reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change", he reportedly said.
According to plan, 30% of the Indian electricity in 2050 will be generated from thorium based reactors.
Indian nuclear scientists estimate that the country could produce 500 GWe for at least four centuries using just the country’s economically extractable thorium reserves.
Thorium energy forecasts.
According to the Chairman of India’s Atomic Energy Commission, Dr Srikumar Banerjee, without the implementation of fast breeders the presently available uranium reserves of 5.469 million tonnes can support 570 GWe till 2025. If the total identified and undiscovered uranium reserves of 16 million tonnes are brought online, the power availability can be extended till the end of the century. While calling for more research into thorium as an energy source and the country’s indigenous three-stage programme, he said, “The world always felt there would be a miracle. Unfortunately, we have not seen any miracle for the last 40 years. Unless we wake up, humans won't be able to exist beyond this century.”

HIV/AIDS in Swaziland

HIV/AIDS in Swaziland was first reported in 1986 but has since reached epidemic proportions due in large part to cultural beliefs which discourage safe-sex practices. Coupled with a high rate of co-infection with tuberculosis, life expectancy has halved in the first decade of the millennium. 
Prevalence.
HIV/AIDS remains one of the major challenges to Swaziland’s socioeconomic development. The epidemic has spread relentlessly in all the parts of the country since the first reported case in 1986.
Periodic surveillance of prenatal clinics in the country has shown a consistent rise in HIV prevalence among pregnant women attending the clinics. The most recent surveillance in antenatal women reported an overall prevalence of 42.6% in 2004. Prevalence of 28% was found among young women aged 15–19. In women ages 25–29, prevalence was 56%.
The Human Development Index o the UN Development Programme reports that as a consequence of HIV/AIDS, life expectancy in Swaziland has fallen from 61 years in 2000, to 32 years in 2009.
From another perspective, the last available World Health Organization data (2002) shows that 64% of all deaths in the country were caused by HIV/AIDS. In 2009, an estimated 7,000 people died from AIDS-related causes. On a total population of approximately 1,185,000 this implies that HIV/AIDS kills an estimated 0.6% of the Swazi population every year. Chronic illnesses that are the most prolific causes of death in the developed world only account for a minute fraction of deaths in Swaziland; for example, heart disease, strokes, and cancer cause a total of less than 5% of deaths in Swaziland, compared to 55% of all deaths yearly in the US.
The United Nations Development Program has written that if the spread of the epidemic in the country continues unabated, the "longer term existence of Swaziland as a country will be seriously threatened".
Cultural background.
Traditional Swazi culture discourages safe sexual practices, like condom use and monogamous relationships. There is a cultural belief in procreation to increase the population size, and Swazis believe a woman should have a minimum of five children and that a man's role is to impregnate as many partners as he can. Men may never get married but still have many children from multiple partners. The few men who do get married often practice polygamy. Sexual aggression is common, with 18% of sexually active high school students saying they were coerced into their first sexual encounter.
Many thousands of children have been orphaned by AIDS, and only 22% grow up in two-parent families.
National response.
In 2003, the National Emergency Response Committee on HIV/AIDS (NERCHA) was established to coordinate and facilitate the national multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS, while the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) was to implement activities. The previous national HIV/AIDS strategic plan covered the period 2000–2005; a new national HIV/AIDS strategic plan and a national HIV/AIDS action plan for the 2006–2008 period are currently being developed by a broad group of national stakeholders. To date, the six key areas of the plan are prevention, care and support, impact mitigation, communications, monitoring and evaluation, and management/coordination.
Despite the widespread nature of the epidemic in Swaziland, HIV/AIDS is still heavily stigmatized. Few people living with HIV/AIDS, particularly prominent people such as religious and traditional leaders and media/sports personalities, have come out publicly and revealed their status. Stigma hinders the flow of information to communities, hampers prevention efforts, and reduces utilization of services.
On June 4, 2009, the USA and Swaziland signed the "Swaziland Partnership Framework on HIV and AIDS for 2009-2013". The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief will contribute to the implementation of Swaziland's multi-sectoral "National Strategic Framework on HIV/AIDS".
HIV-TB co-infection.
Tuberculosis is also a significant problem, with an 18 percent mortality rate. Many patients have a multi-drug resistant strain, and 83 percent are co-infected with HIV. There are roughly 14,000 new TB cases diagnosed each year.

HIV/AIDS in Malawi

In 2005, approximately 14.3 percent of the adult population ages 15 to 49 in Malawi was living with HIV/AIDS. With one of the highest adult prevalence rates in the world, the epidemic has exacerbated social problems as diverse as food security, human resource capacity and national defense. In Malawi, women are disproportionately affected by the epidemic. In 2005, approximately 500,000 women 15 years and older were living with HIV/AIDS. The primary mode of HIV transmission is unprotected heterosexual sex. Mother-to-child HIV transmission is the second major mode of HIV transmission, accounting for approximately 83,000 pediatric HIV infections in 2005.
HIV prevalence in Malawi is significantly higher in urban areas (20.4 percent) than in semi-urban (17.0 percent) and rural areas (13.0 percent). However, there is evidence that while infection rates are slowing in urban areas, HIV prevalence continues to increase in rural areas. The Southern region of Malawi is the most densely populated and has the highest prevalence rate among pregnant women, 21.7 percent. The Northern and Central regions have prevalence rates among pregnant women of 14.0 percent and 14.3 percent respectively.
The scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Malawi presents many challenges to treatment. One of the greatest challenges is building the capacity of Malawi’s health care system – especially in the rural areas – to cope with the enormous needs of the people. Other serious constraints include: the severe lack of trained health care professionals and para-professionals; limited access to health services, especially in rural areas and among the poor; an inefficient supply chain for drugs and other supplies; inadequate physical infrastructure; and limited laboratory capacity. These critical barriers make it particularly difficult to provide treatment and care. The high levels of HIV infection have resulted in an unprecedented increase in the number of tuberculosis cases, which rose to over 27,000 cases annually in recent years. The disease burden is also exacerbated by endemic malaria, which affects up to four million people annually, the majority of whom are women and children.

Cuisine of the Maritimes

The Maritimes region of Canada has some unique foods; the region has foodstuffs that are indigenous to the area and cultural phenomena has brought non-native foods to the area. The region is in Eastern Canada, and comprises three provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. On the Atlantic coast, the Maritimes are a subregion of Atlantic Canada. Much of what is local food or regional cuisine there could be found in the foods of the Native Peoples or indigenous people, sometimes called Indians, whose cultures preceded those to be found in the Maritimes today. 
Common foods and dishes.
Poutine râpée, an Acadian pork-potato dish, and rapée/rapie pie, an Acadian poultry dish, are Maritime-based. (Acadia, or Acadie in French, is the French Canada different from Quebec, based in the Maritimes, and known to those in the United States chiefly because Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Evangeline and the Cajuns of Louisiana who originated there.) Seafood is of great importance in the Maritimes and it is prepared in many ways, probably limited only by the number of cooks. Lobster rolls are to be found wherever tourists go, but the locals love them too; these can be found in the United States as well, particularly in Maine, which adjoins the Province of New Brunswick, the only province with two official languages, French and English, which is an indication of the cultures one will find in this province between Quebec and Nova Scotia. 
No one who has visited the homes of Maritimers who go back a few generations is likely to forget dulse; dulse is seaweed of a certain type and grows along the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia coasts. Some Maritimers crunch on dried dulse, a reddish-purple-to-black salty-tasting snack, rather as others would munch potato chips and one usually sees a small dish on a side table somewhere near where family members are sitting. 
Maple sugar, in many forms, from maple syrup (sirop d'érable) to little maple-leaf-shaped crunchy candies is an important sweet in Eastern Canada, where sugaring-off excursions (involving 'tire d'érable sur la neige,' when the hot syrup is poured onto snow to crystallize) are one of the better winter activities. It is also an important export, economically. 
On Prince Edward Island, Cow's Ice Cream is an important purveyor of a local favourite, and dairy products in various forms are important to residents of the Maritimes. A popular variety of ice cream in the Maritimes, and also New England, is grape nut ice cream.
Wild blueberries grow in abundance in the Maritimes and are there for the picking for anyone willing to take the time, which is considerable because they are small.This cited source does not support the proposition footnoted. They can be made into the Acadian dumpling dessert called blueberry grunt, among others. Seal flippers and seal flipper pie, various bean dishes, usually flavored with pork, any fish found in the many rivers, and many other foods are not to be forgotten.
In Nova Scotia, there is a dish that is widely eaten in the Annapolis Valley known as Hodge Podge or Hodegy Podegy. This dish is a stew or soup containing fresh vegetables such as small baby potatoes or new potatoes, fresh peas, green beans and wax beans as well as carrots. These vegetables are cooked in a milk broth that contains butter, pepper and salt. Commonly, this dish is accompanied by corned beef either from a can or prepared separately from the dish. Hodge Podge is generally consumed during the months of July and August when these vegetables are in season.
Restaurants and pubs.
A lot of the restaurants and pubs in the Maritimes feature British and Irish dishes such as Corned beef and cabbage, Bacon and cabbage, Bangers and mash, and Fish and chips. But they will also have their own specialities such as Jiggs dinner.
Donair and garlic fingers are Maritime specialities, and are difficult to find in other parts of Canada.
A typical brand of beer served in Nova Scotia is known as Keith's or Alexander Keith's and was established in 1820 by Keith himself.

<doc id="19023515" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19023515" title="Schichau-Werke">
Schichau-Werke

The Schichau-Werke was a German engineering works and shipyard based in Elbing, formerly part of the German Empire, and which is today the town of Elbląg in northern Poland. It also had a subsidiary shipyard in Danzig (now: Gdańsk). Due to the Soviet conquest Schichau moved the company to Bremerhaven in March 1945, continuing production until 1996. 
Early years.
Ferdinand Schichau had studied engineering in Berlin, the Rheinland and Great Britain. In 1837, he founded the engineering institution, later known as "F. Schichau GmbH, Maschinen- und Lokfabrik, Elbing" (F. Schichau engineering and locomotive factory, Elbing). It started with the production of hydraulic presses and diggers; in 1860, it began to produce the first locomotives for the Prussian Eastern Railway. From 1867 locomotive construction began in earnest and, three years later, the factory was connected to the railway network. In the early 20th century, the firm was one of several that delivered the Prussian P 8, the most numerous passenger train steam locomotive of its day.
Shipyards.
From 1847, Schichau produced steam engines for ships, starting with the engine for the first entirely Prussian-built steamer "James Watt" (of neighbor Mitzlaff shipyard). In 1854, Schichau built the shipyard at Elbing, known as the "Elbinger Dampfschiffs-Reederei F. Schichau" ('Elbing Steamship Shipping Company F. Schichau'). The first ship launched was the small steamer "Borussia" in 1855 (she was the first Prussian iron screw ship). The shipyard was subsequently expanded, and in 1872 Schichau bought Mitzlaff's shipyard in Elbing. 
From 1877 the shipyard produced ships for the Prussian Navy and export, becoming specialized in torpedo boats and later destroyers. It became a major manufacturer of torpedo boats for the Prussian Navy. The engine of "S 1", which was built by Schichau in 1884 as one of Germany’s first torpedo boats, is shown on display in the Deutsches Museum in Munich today. 
Since the shipyard's location on the Elbing River limited the size of ships that could be constructed, in 1892 Schichau built a second shipyard in Danzig, which was capable of producing bigger warships, up to battleship size, as well as freighters and passenger ships. Both shipyards also built ships for export worldwide, especially torpedo boats. In 1889 Schichau built a small repair shipyard in Pillau (present-day Baltijsk) near Königsberg (Prussia) (today Kaliningrad). Schichau's son-in-law, Carl Heinz Ziese, worked at Schichau-Werke and continued to run the business after Schichau's death in 1896, until 1917.
Inter-war years.
When Ziese died in 1917, the management of the company passed to the husband of his only daughter, Hildegard, the Swede, Carl Carlson. After his death, Hildegard Carlson ran the firm. After World War I, the shipyard was threatened with bankruptcy and in 1929 it was bought by the German government. In 1930, the company bought also a small yard in Königsberg (now: Yantar Shipyard). 
Following the separation of East Prussia from Germany after the First World War, the Schichau works, together with the Union-Giesserei in Königsberg (that they later took over), was encouraged to focus on locomotive building with the aid of eastern European aid ("Ostlandhilfe"). During the Second World War, the firm of Borsig placed several contracts with the Schichau-Werke in Elbing, that continued production until January 1945.
U-boat production.
In World War I, Schichau entered production of U-boats conctructing two Ms Type U-boats, and . Both boats had not been completed when the war ended and were eventually broken up. During World War II, Schichau built 94 U-boats for the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) at its Danzig shipyard. The yard in Elbing produced engines and submarines of the "Seehund" class. In addition to the manufacture of Type VII C submarines, the shipyard in Danzig also built the new Type XXI U-boats. Up to 1944, 62 Type VII C U-boats (and two Type VII C/41s) were built, before production was switched to the Type XXI. A total of 30 submarines of this latter class were built and launched at Danzig by the end of the war.
Locomotive Production.
Up to the end of the war in 1945, the Schichau-Werke had supplied about 4,300 locomotives of several classes to customers that included the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the Polish State Railways. These included the DRG and DRB standard steam locomotive ("Einheitsdampflokomotive") classes 23, 41, 52 and 86. The Schichau-Werke also designed the Class 24 and delivered the first two batches The factory sites were dismantled by Russian occupying forces after the war.
Recent History.
At the end of the war the original factory sites went into Polish ownership with the loss of East Prussia to Poland and the Soviet Union. They no longer build locomotives, instead building ships, wagons, and boilers. The Schichau shipyard at Danzig was included into the Lenin shipyard in 1950 and, in 1980, attracted world-wide media coverage as a result of protests led by the Solidarność trades union. 
In early 1945 a floating dock was transferred to Flender Werke in Lübeck, in March the same year Hermann Noë, the chief executive, and some employees fled Danzig with uncompleted ships to Bremerhaven. In April Noë founded there a new company named "F. Schichau Aktiengesellschaft", however, the uncompleted rumps and u-boats, tugged from Danzig, could not be finished anymore. With employees from the old premises machinery, agricultural engines, locomotives and trams were repaired after the war. Furthermore Schichau developed a new welding torch with a photo-electric steering. After on 26 May 1951 the western Allies lifted the ban on shipbuilding in West Germany Schichau reopened its shipyard in Bremerhaven. In 1953 Schichau was restituted its floating dock which had been taken as a British reparation in the meantime. 
Schichau was later merged into the "Schichau Seebeck Shipyard Company", which went into bankruptcy in 1996 following the demise of Bremer Vulkan. Its successor company was the "SSW Schichau Seebeck Shipyard", closed down on 31 July 2009, based at Bremerhaven.
Schichau made ships still afloat.

HIV/AIDS in Mozambique

Mozambique is facing a severe, generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the impact is not uniformly distributed. In 2005, the prevalence of HIV infection among adults ages 15 to 49 was estimated to be 16.1 percent. The primary mode of transmission is through heterosexual contact, with women at much greater risk for HIV infection than men. Young women ages 15 to 24 have an estimated HIV prevalence of 10.7 percent, compared to a prevalence rate of 3.6 percent among young men in the same age group. A civil war restricted movement within and outside the country until 1992, but returning refugees, as well as economic and commercial activity since then has rapidly fueled HIV prevalence to levels nearly as high as those in neighboring countries. Other populations with high HIV prevalence rates include mobile populations, people in prostitution, and those living close to major transportation routes.1 Mozambique also suffers co-epidemics of tuberculosis and malaria in addition to seasonal cholera outbreaks, all of which exacerbate the impact of HIV/AIDS.
In 2010, the rate is estimated to be 11.5%, distributed amongst 13.1% of female and 9.2% of male adults aged 15–49. An estimated 5.7 million people are affected.
As Mozambique scales up HIV/AIDS programs and more people are reached with prevention, treatment and care services, it is vital to strengthen the capacity of Mozambican individuals and institutions to manage and deliver these services. According to the 2006 Human Development Report, Mozambique has approximately three physicians for every 100,000 people. Shortages of other health providers (such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians) are comparable. Outside of the health system, where the multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS response depends fundamentally on community-based initiatives and volunteers, Mozambique also is severely disadvantaged, with an adult literacy rate of only 46.5 percent (31.4 percent among women) and high levels of stigma and discrimination.

Marcello Craveri (23 March 1914) was an Italian biblical scholar. Born in Turin, he earned his doctorate in 1940 and then saw military service.
His most widely read work probably is "The Life of Jesus" published in 1966, and in paperback English translation in 1967. On the biblical evidence, and the then-available evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls, Craveri concluded that the claims to divinity made by the historical Jesus were strictly limited and not unusual for a Jew of that generation. Much of the stronger claims, and the emphasis on the redeeming power of Christ's death on the Cross, could be seen as reworkings by St. Paul, who was probably influenced strongly by the Graeco-Roman traditions.

Ambrosia pumila

Ambrosia pumila is a rare species of ragweed known by the common names dwarf burr ragweed and San Diego ambrosia. It is native to far southern California and Baja California where it grows in floodplains and chaparral scrub. 
Distribution.
It is adapted to dry habitat, but only on floodplains that are periodically submerged, or in depressions containing vernal pools or similar structures. It is a plant of open habitat and is probably not tolerant of shade.
Today it is known from 19 populations. Fourteen of them are in San Diego County, two exist in Riverside County, and there are three south of the border in Baja California, Mexico. Most of its native habitat has been consumed by urbanization and development. It is also threatened by agriculture. This is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.
Description.
"Ambrosia pumila" is a hairy perennial herb not exceeding in height. The leaves are gray-green and fuzzy and divided into several subdivided segments. They are up to 13 centimeters long, not counting the winged petioles. 
The inflorescence is tipped with staminate (male) flower heads above several larger pistillate (female) heads. The pistillate heads each yield usually one fruit, which is a fuzzy burr only a few millimeters wide with short, soft spines. The plant rarely produces seeds. The plant reproduces vegetatively, sending up new sprouts from an elongated rhizome system.
Conservation.
Critical habitat was declared for the species in 2010, listing areas that should be protected for the survival of the plant. Protected areas containing this plant include sections of land in the cities of Temecula and Oceanside, near Fallbrook and Lake Hodges, and within the bounds of Mission Trails Regional Park and the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge.
One threat to the species is the invasion of non-native weeds, which tower over the plant and shade it out. It is challenging to remove the dense stands of weeds without injuring the rare plant.

St Paul's Cathedral School

St. Paul's Cathedral School is an independent school associated with St Paul's Cathedral in London and is located in New Change in the City of London. 
The School has around 220 pupils, most of whom are day pupils, both boys and girls, including up to 40 boy choristers who are all boarders and who singing the daily services in St Paul's Cathedral. The School became co-educational in 2002.
History.
Originally the School was set up to provide education solely for the Choristers and dates from about 1123, when 8 needy children were given a home and education in return for singing in the Cathedral. The Choir School and a Grammar School co-existed under the aegis of the Cathedral for many years, until the Grammar School was moved and re-established in 1511 by the humanist Dean John Colet to become Saint Paul's School. The Cathedral School and the Grammar School are now distinct and separate institutions.
The original Choir School, which stood in St Paul's Churchyard, was destroyed with the Cathedral in the Great Fire of London in 1666. The School has had several incarnations being re-built in 1670, in 1822 (in Cheapside) and 1887 (in Carter Lane). The current buildings date from the 1960s.
Activities.
In addition to the daily Evensong, the choristers of St. Paul's Cathedral, have taken part in a number of important recording and tours and they have performed at a number of important state occasions, including Winston Churchill's funeral and the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales.
Child-abuse controversy.
In December 2007 Stephen Douglas-Hogg, a former Classics and house master of the school, was arrested and charged with the abuse of a number of choristers during the 1980s. Following his attempted suicide during the initial stages of proceedings in October 2008, the 50-year-old Douglas-Hogg changed his plea halfway through the trial and admitted to 13 counts of indecent assault on five boys aged under 14. On 11 May 2009 Douglas-Hogg was sentenced to 4 and a half years imprisonment at Southwark Crown Court. 
Det Supt Jeff Davies, who led the City of London Police team investigating the offences, said: “This was a difficult and sensitive investigation for the officers involved. I hope the conclusion of the case will go some way to helping those who have suffered as a result of the abuse they endured more than 20 years ago.”
Judge Michael Gledhill QC labelled Douglas-Hogg a "paedophile" who used his authority to strike fear into his victims, who were too afraid to report what happened. He said Douglas-Hogg showed no remorse and added: "You should be a broken man; regrettably, I have serious doubts as to whether or not you actually are."

Ogoh-ogoh

Ogoh-ogoh are statues built for the Ngrupuk parade, which takes place on the eve of Nyepi day in Bali, Indonesia. Ogoh-ogoh normally have form of mythological beings, mostly demons. As with many creative endeavours based on Balinese Hinduism, the creation of Ogoh-ogoh represents spiritual aims inspired by Hindu philosophy.
The main purpose of the making of Ogoh-ogoh is the purification of the natural environment of any spiritual pollutants emitted from the activities of living beings (especially humans). The forms of Ogoh-ogoh represent the Bhuta-Kala (Bhuta: eternal energy, Kala: eternal time), according to Hindu teachings. The imperceptible potentials of nature cannot be thoroughly explored by anyone. Philosophically, civilized men are required to manage the natural resources without damaging the environment itself.
Aside from being the symbol of Bhuta-Kala, Ogoh-ogoh is considered a symbol of modes of nature that form the malicious characters of living beings. Ogoh-ogoh are usually made by the group of artists found in villages around Bali. After being paraded on a convoy around the town, finally it is burnt to ashes in a cemetery as a symbol of self-purification.
An Ogoh-ogoh is normally standing on a pad built of timber planks and bamboos. The pad is designed to sustain the Ogoh-ogoh while it is being lifted and carried around the village or the town square. There are normally eight or more men carrying the Ogoh-ogoh on their shoulders. This procession is accompanied by orchestral music performed by the youth. The use of flares is also a main part of the parade.
During the procession, the Ogoh-ogoh is rotated counter-clockwise three times. This act is done at every T-junction and crossroad of the village. Rotating the effigies during the cremational parade and the eve of Nyepi represents the contact of the bodies with the spirits. It is intended to bewilder the evil spirits so that they go away and cease harming human beings.
The Ogoh-ogoh is a very recent addition to the Nyepi ceremonies, first appearing in Denpasar in the early 1980s. At that time, they were carefully monitored for any criticism of the Suharto regime.

Jerome Xavier DuBois

Jerome Xavier DuBois (; pinyin: dùjíe) is the first Canadian-born Taiwanese mandopop singer and songwriter. Like Aska Yang () and Yoga Lin (), DuBois made his international debut on CTVs One Million Star ().
The early years.
DuBois was born in Montreal, Quebec. He began writing his own music at age seven, and shortly after, began performing at Vancouver's Granville Island on weekends. While in elementary school, DuBois was invited to join the British Columbia Children's Honour Choir. In highscool he participated in drama and musical clubs.
Musical career.
3rd Canadian Chinese Songwriter's Quest.
In 1998 DuBois competed and won first place in both divisions at the 3rd Canadian Chinese Songwriter's Quest on Fairchild TV. He was the first caucasian to enter, and also the first mandarin song to ever win (previous years were all cantonese songs). At this point in time, DuBois was in the middle of his software engineering studies at the University of British Columbia and decided to complete his degree. DuBois's song Awake In The Dream (Chinese: 醒在夢裡), with lyrics written by long-time friend Johnny Chiang, was played over the Chinese radio stations Canada-wide and he appeared on Chinese television several times. He performed throughout the lower mainland at venues including the Michael J Fox theatre, the Plaza of Nations, and Stanley Park following Emil Chau 周華建. Jerome published his first single in the CHKG World Music Spectacular '98 (collection) / (custom release from CHKG radio, Vancouver BC). The song was recently used by Rick Steves on his radio show (Program 130: An American Travel Guide to China, Airdate: April 12, 2008).
Dave Wang (Chinese:王傑).
After winning the national songwriting contest, celebrity singer and songwriter Dave Wang () contacted DuBois and became his mentor. Dave recorded his own version of DuBois's song Awake In The Dream (Chinese: 醒在夢裡), and used it as the theme song of his radio show on Fairchild Radio. Dave's version of DuBois's song is available online here: 王傑 醒在夢裡
One Million Star.
In 2008 DuBois became the first caucasian to qualify for Taiwan Television's hit show One Million Star (超級星光大道), an international singing contest similar to American Idol scouting talent from Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and the USA. Jerome competed under the Taiwan division, passing the 100 contestant elimination round with his performance of Jay Chow's Silence (). He continued on the show, receiving continued acclaim from the judges for his accuracy in Chinese pronunciation. It was immediately apparent that his singing was honest, heartfelt and emotional. At the top twenty elimination round, Jerome performed his song "一起過好" (music and lyrics both written by Jerome). The song was broadcast internationally, marking his place in history as the first caucasian Taiwanese mandopop singer and songwriter. Despite his achievement, he received a low score of 12/25 for his performance, eliminating him from the show and subsequently causing internet fans to protest the decision to such an extent that the protests made the entertainment section of the national China Times newspaper. Despite being eliminated from the show, Jerome relocated to Taipei vowing to continue writing music for his fans. He is working on his next album release.

Kaka Kalelkar

Dattatreya Balkrushna Kalelkar (Devanagari: दत्तात्रेय बाळकृष्ण कालेलकर) (1885–1981), popularly known as Kaka Kalelkar, was an Indian independence activist, social reformer and journalist. He was a major follower of the philosophy and methods of Mahatma Gandhi. 
Kalelkar was born in Belgundi Village, Taluka and District Belgaum, Karnataka near Sawantwadi in Maharashtra. He had his college education at Fergusson College in Pune. 
After his college education, he worked for a while on the editorial staff of a nationalistic Marathi daily named "Rashtramat" (राष्ट्रमत), and then as a teacher at a school named Gangadhar Vidyalay in Baroda. Within a few years, the ruling British government forcibly closed down the school because of its nationalistic spirit. 
After a few years, Kalelkar became a member of Mahatma Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat. For some time, he served as the editor of "Sarwodaya" (सर्वोदय) periodical which was run from the premises of the Ashram. With Gandhi's encouragement, he played an active role in establishing Gujarat Vidyapith at Ahmedabad, and served as its vice-chancellor for some years. Gujaratis lovingly called him સવઈ ગુજરાતી.(savai gujrati) meaning 1.25 gujrati 
Kalelkar also worked very actively in the "Hindustani Prachar Sabha" (हिंदुस्तानी प्रचार सभा) institution whose object was to popularize Hindi/Hindustani language as the national language of India, which would then serve to bind Indians closer.
For various nationalistic causes such as popularizing Hindi/Hindustani as the national language, Kalelkar traveled extensively throughout India, covering thousands of miles, notably mostly on foot. He then went on writing remarkable, voluminous travelogues in Gujarati, Marathi, and Hindi.
Kalelkar was a member of Indian Rajya Sabha for twelve years after India's independence.
Backwards Classes Commission.
In 1953, six years after India got its independence from the British Raj, the central government established a "Backwards Classes Commission" under Kalelkar's chairmanship with the charter to recommend reforms for removing inequities for underprivileged people. The Commission issued its report in 1955, recommending, among other things, that the government grant special privileges to "untouchables" and other underprivileged people.
While forwarding the above report to the central government, Kalelkar attached a letter, recording his strong disagreement with the Commission's fundamental conclusions. He wrote that the suggested remedies were worse than the evils they sought to combat. He wrote that the whole line of investigation pursued by the Commission was “repugnant to the spirit of democracy since in democracy it is the individual, not the family or the caste, which is the unit." He recommended that the state regard as backward and entitled to special educational and economic aid all persons whose total annual family income was less than 800 rupees that time regardless of their caste or community. He stated his disagreement with the Commission's recommendation of reserving posts in government services for the backward classes.
Writings.
The following is a partial list of Kalelkar's books: 
Gandhi charitra Kirtana (Hindi)
Honors.
Kalelkar received a Sahitya Akademi Award in 1965 for his "Jeevan-Vyavastha" collection of essays in Gujarati. He was honored with Sahitya Akademi Fellowship in 1971 for his literary achievements.
The Government of India conferred on him Padma Vibhushan (India's second-highest Civilian Award after the "Bharat Ratna") in 1964 along with Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi (In that year Bharat Ratna was not awarded to anyone). It also issued a commemorative stamp in his honor in 1985.

Largo desolato

Largo Desolato is a semi-autobiographical play by Václav Havel about a political dissident, Leopold Nettles (originally in Czech "Kopřiva"), who fears being sent to prison for his writing. Leopold faces mounting pressure from his friends, admirers and colleagues; these pressures in addition to ongoing state surveillance have made him incapable of writing anything further. The English translation of this play by Tom Stoppard, himself born in Czechoslovakia, received its world premiere in Bristol, England, in 1986.
Havel is reported to have written this play in the days following his release from prison in 1984.
Characters.
Leopold Nettles (Kopřiva) – a professor, philosopher and author whose writing made him a populist hero; however, continued state surveillance and the fear of imminent imprisonment has rendered him an increasingly neurotic recluse.
Edward and Bertram – Leopold's friends and/or colleagues, growing increasingly concerned with his soundness of body and mind.
Suzana – Leopold's housemate, or possibly his wife; their relationship is never specifically stated. It is implied that she is involved romantically with Edward.
Lucy – Leopold's lover, frustrated at his inability to open himself emotionally
Marguerite – a philosophy student who goes to Leopold for counsel
Two Chaps – Government agents who offer Leopold his freedom if he repudiates his writing
Two Sidneys – workers from the local paper mill, meant to represent the opinions of the common man
Two Men - mute enforcers for the two Chaps
Plot.
Leopold Nettles, a dissident political writer and philosopher, lives under constant state surveillance and fears being sent to prison at any moment. He has become increasingly reclusive, neurotic, dependent on drugs and alcohol, and incapable of writing further.
In addition to political pressure, he also faces pressure from friends and admirers: his housemate (and possible spouse) Suzana who has lost all patience and sympathy with him, his colleagues Edward and Bertram who are almost absurdly concerned with his bodily and mental functions, his lover Lucy who is increasingly frustrated with his emotional unavailability, and two paper mill laborers who bring him paper and stolen personnel files naively thinking it will inspire him to write.
Late one night he is visited by two government agents who offer to drop all charges if he signs a paper claiming he isn't the author of the offending works. He asks for and is granted time to consider, but in the interim his neuroses only heighten and he estranges himself further from his colleagues. When the agents return, Leopold finally resolves that he would rather face prison than repudiate his writing. They then inform him that the offer has been deemed unnecessary, for the time being, as his neuroses have effectively neutralized him as a further threat to the state.
Leopold's state of mind is textually represented by the constant repetition of dialogue throughout the play, suggesting a circular 'whirlpool' effect.

Georg Prahl Harbitz

Georg Prahl Harbitz (26 June 1802 – 22 November 1889) was a Norwegian priest and politician.
He was born in Haus to innkeeper Nils Harbitz and his wife Elisabet Christine Ibsen. His father died when Georg was eight years old, and he was eventually sent to the wealthy family Prahl in Bergen for upbringing. Here, he was inspired to undertake academic studies. He graduated as cand.theol. in 1825, and was assigned, by the Church of Norway, the post as vicar ("sogneprest") in Askevold in Nordre Bergenhus Amt.
He became involved in politics, and when local government was introduced in Norway, Harbitz served as the first mayor of Askevold municipality. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1836 and 1839, representing the constituency of "Nordre Bergenhus Amt". From the start he was known as peasant-friendly, a political current which began making its mark in Parliament from 1830. He was conservative in Constitutional matters.
He left Askevold in 1839, his wife having died the same year. He was assigned the position of vicar in Slidre, in Christians Amt. While stationed here, he was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1842 and 1845. In 1847 he applied for the position as garrison priest in Christiania; however, he discovered that he was not looked kindly upon there, and returned to Christians Amt. In the meantime, Slidre had been split into Øystre and Vestre Slidre; Harbitz became vicar of Vestre Slidre. He was elected to Parliament two more times, in 1848 and 1851. During the 1848 term he was President of the Storting, together with Halvor Olaus Christensen, Hans Riddervold and Carl Valentin Falsen.
He then decided to leave Vestre Slidre for financial reasons. Reportedly, the wage was low and often delayed. Harbitz applied for the vicarship in Nøtterø, and began this tenure in 1852. Representing the constituency of "Jarlsberg og Laurvigs Amt", he was elected to Parliament in 1854, 1857, 1859, 1862, 1865 and 1868. He continued to serve as President of the Storting for each of these terms. In 1864 he was the sole holder of this position, and held the principal speeches commemorating the fiftieth anniversaries of the Constitution of Norway (on 17 May) and the Union between Sweden and Norway (on 4 November).
Having chosen to not stand for parliamentary re-election in 1870, he sought retirement from his vicarship in December 1878, and finally left the position when a replacement was found in April 1879. He was granted a 6,000 kr yearly pension. His successor was Johan Nordahl Brun, not to be confused with the poet of the same name. Georg Prahl Harbitz moved to Abbediengen in Vestre Aker, where his son resided. He died in 1889, and was buried in Askvold. He had been issued the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav in 1864, as well as the Grand Cross of the Swedish Order of the Polar Star.
Georg Prahl Harbitz was married to Maren Mariken Hof from Aker. The couple had four daughters and four sons, the oldest was born in 1827 and the youngest was born just before Maren died in 1839. Georg Prahl Harbitz did not remarry. Their oldest son Johannes Winding Harbitz became a parliament member and government minister. Another son Georg Prahl Harbitz, Jr. became a vicar as well, and married the sister of politician Walter Scott Dahl. Georg Prahl Harbitz had struggled with health problems, so did several of his children.

New Zealand Free For All

The New Zealand Pacing Free For All is a major New Zealand harness race. It is notable as it is a Group One championship sprint race and has been won by nearly every champion pacer in New Zealand. It was valued at $300,000, but was reduced to $200,000 due to economic pressures. Horses which have won the Free-for-all include hall of famers and champions who later shone in the United States and Canada like Cardigan Bay and Caduceus. The latter who won the Free For All three times. The race has also been won three times by Robalan, Harold Logan, Lordship and Author Dillon.
The race is contested at Addington Raceway on the Show Day public holiday on the Friday of New Zealand Cup week in mid-November. With the New Zealand Trotting Cup run on the Tuesday of that week, the Free For All attracts most of the same horses as the Cup, and is often won in the same year by the same horse. Unlike the Cup, it is run over a sprint distance and from a mobile start. The 2008 race was won in record time (1.54 mile rate for 2000m) by Auckland Reactor. From 2012, the race will be contested over 1 mile (1609m), meaning the race will start on a bend.

Born in Lozells, Birmingham, Warner began his football career with Milton, before moving to Aston Villa in May 1886. He played for Aston Villa for six years, making a total of 101 appearances in all competitions. In 1887, he was a member of the Villa side which defeated Rangers 3–1 in the FA Cup semi-final, to set up a final against local rivals West Bromwich Albion. In the final, played at Kennington Oval on 2 April 1887, Albion were the favourites having been (defeated) finalists the previous year, and also having defeated Preston North End in the semi-final. In the first twenty minutes of the final, the Villa defence was put under heavy pressure, but "Warner played a brave game in goal, repeatedly foiling Albion's attempts to charge him, ball in hand, over his own goal-line." Warner successfully prevented the Albion forwards from scoring, and in the second half Villa score twice with goals by Archie Hunter and Dennis Hodgetts, to win the cup for the first time.
On 8 September 1888, Villa made their first appearance in The Football League on the first day of the inaugural season, 1888-89. In the match against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Warner was in goal when defender Gershom Cox "had the misfortune of kicking the ball through his own goalposts". Thus Cox scored and Warner conceded the first goal in the Football League. 
In the first three league seasons, Warner was virtually ever-present, missing only two matches, with Villa gaining the runners-up spot in 1888-89. The following season, Villa were less successful finishing eighth in the table and were one of five clubs having to apply to be re-elected to the league. 1890-91 was similar, with Villa finishing ninth and again having to suffer "the indignation of the re-election process".
In 1891-92, injury restricted Warner to only eleven league appearances with Albert Hinchley replacing him. Warner was able to recover to appear in all five FA Cup matches, when Villa reached the final where they again met local rivals West Bromwich Albion. In the final, played at Kennington Oval on 19 March 1892, Warner and his colleagues in the Villa defence were no match for Billy Bassett and the Albion forwards who won the match comfortably 3–0, with goals from Jasper Geddes, Sammy Nicholls and Jack Reynolds.
Suspicions were immediately raised over Warner's performance in the Cup Final. In the weeks preceding the Final, Warner skipped training sessions with the rest of the Villa side, and was also seen in earnest conversation with a mysterious man in a sharp suit and hat. He fumbled Geddes long-range shot and allowed the ball into the back of the net for West Brom's first goal, while he fumbled a straightforward save twenty minutes later, allowing Nicholls to score. Then finally in the second half Reynolds long-range shot flew into the net past a hopelessly out-of-position Warner. Rumours began to circulate that Warner had lost a substantial amount of money on a best and had agreed to throw the Cup Final in order to recoup his losses
Villa finished the 1891-92 in fourth place in the league, but Warner's Villa career was over and, in July 1892, he was transferred to Newton Heath in Manchester.
Newton Heath.
He became Newton Heath's first choice goalkeeper straight away in their first season in the Football League and made 20 consecutive appearances at the start of the season. However, he failed to show up for an away match against Stoke City on 7 January 1893, resulting in centre-half Willie Stewart having to play as a makeshift goalkeeper; the team lost 7–1. Warner explained to the club directors that he had missed his train to Stoke, but they were unconvinced and suspended him for a month. After his suspension was up, Warner made just three more appearances for Newton Heath (two in the league and one in the Manchester Senior Cup), and was sold to Walsall Town Swifts at the end of the season.
Walsall Town Swifts.
His career at Walsall was short-lived too, and he retired in 1894.
Warner died in Pittsburgh, United States, on 7 July 1943.

Automated online assistant

An automated online assistant is a program that uses artificial intelligence to provide customer service or other assistance on a website. Such an assistant may basically consist of a dialog system, an avatar, as well an expert system to provide specific expertise to the user.
Automated online assistants have the ability to provide customer service during 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, and may, at least, be a complement to customer service by humans. One report estimated that an automated online assistant produced a 30% decrease in the work-load for a human-provided call centre.
Usage.
Large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact. Also, IKEA has an automated online assistant in their help center.
Automated online assistants can also be implemented via Twitter, or Windows Live Messenger, such as, for example, Robocoke for Coca Cola Hungary. This automated online assistant provides users with information about the brand Coca Cola, but he can also give users party and concert recommendations all over Hungary.
Popular online portals like eBay and PayPal are also using multilingual virtual agents to offer online support to their customers. 
In the travel sector, some new generation airlines like Vueling Airlines are also using virtual agents to offer online sales and customer support. In this case, the virtual assistant was developed by Anboto Group and the agent is handling 200.000 conversations per month in English and Spanish. National Rail Enquiries' "Ask Lisa", developed by Creative Virtual and their partners The Virtual Zone answers over 9,000 questions per day about passenger rail services. Creative Virtual also created the automated online assistants for Lloyds Banking Group and Verizon, who has seen a call deflection of up to 40% as a result of the implementation of "Ask Verizon "partnering with AlterEgos.
Such is the growing demand for more complex and powerful online virtual agents, UK-based AI Applied are working as the first independent worldwide consultants helping businesses get the best out of the technology.
Components.
Dialog system.
The main function of the dialog system of automated online assistants is to translate the human-generated input into a digital format that the automated online assistant can use for further processing by its expert system, as well as interpret whatever solutions or replies it generates back to what a human user understands, and optimally in a way as natural and user-friendly as possible. A major underlying technology to such systems is natural language processing.
In addition, the dialog systems of many automated online assistants have integrated chatterbots, giving them more or less ability of engaging in small talk or casual conversations unrelated to the scope of their expert systems, or simply making the dialog feel more natural.
Avatar.
The avatar of an automated online assistant may be called an "interactive online character" or "automated character". It makes the automated online assistant a form of embodied agent. It aims to enhance human-computer interaction by simulating real-world conversations and experience. Such an interaction model can be constructed to guide conversations in planned directions or allow characters to guide natural language exchanges.
Because such characters can express social roles and emotions of real people, they can increase the trust
that users place in online experiences. The level of interactiveness increases the perceived realism and effectiveness of such "actors", which translates into more prosperous on-line services and commerce.
When choosing an avatar to represent a business, it's important to make sure it makes the right impression. Avatars are subject to the principles of the Uncanny Valley and creating a lifelike, photorealistic character without proper consideration of the user experience can have a detrimental affect on web visitors' experience. Sometimes an extremely knowledgeable, intelligent and well designed system with a simple text box can be as, if not more effective.
Other components.
An automated online assistant also has an expert system that provides specific service, whose scope depends on the purpose of it. This system can be described as an intelligent agent that functions to perceive the needs of customers in order to perform proper reactions by various structured systems.
Also, servers and other maintaining systems to keep the automated assistant online may also be regarded as components of it.

Avo Session Basel

AVO SESSION Basel is an indoor music festival, which takes place every October/November in Basel, Switzerland. The festival features international as well as national artists of diverse music genres in an intimate club setting. In 2010 the festival celebrated its 25th jubilee.
The start.
The AVO SESSION Basel emerged from a festival known as the Rheinknie Session in 1986. 
The five concerts of the first installment of the Festival in May 1986, included performances by Oscar Peterson, Albert Collins and Koko Taylor. The second year’s edition included shows by Fats Domino and Buddy Guy.
Regional establishment.
In 1988 Miles Davis agreed to perform at the festival. Subsequently the festival was first acknowledged outside of north-western Switzerland. Names such as Dizzy Gillespie, Michel Petrucciani and Herbie Hancock followed and Claude Nobs from Montreux Jazz Festival joined as a member of the patrons committee.
In its first ten years the festival focussed on continuous growth. By gradually integrating musical styles such as world music, soul and funk after 1995, it proved possible to approach a younger audience. 
National take-off.
In 1997 the festival management decided to revamp the festival's content as well as its look and the festivals image was rejuvenated with greater importance attached to the attraction and driving power of international performers. 
Embracing this vision, presenting sponsor AVO Cigars, part of Oettinger Davidoff, agreed to a growth-orientated sponsorship deal. 
In the following years the festival now called AVO SESSION Basel presented artists such as Bob Geldof (1998), Ray Charles (1999), James Brown (2000), Chris de Burgh (2001), Paolo Conte (2002), Deep Purple (2003), Lionel Richie (2004), Simply Red (2005), Sir Elton John (2006), Joe Cocker (2007), Mark Knopfler (2007), Amy Macdonald (2008), Grace Jones (2009), Tom Jones (2009), Jamiroquai (2010), Mary J. Blige (2010), Laura Pausini (2011), and Rod Stewart (2012).
The club style seating arrangement, the combination of acts and the opportunity to experience big names in an intimate atmosphere have become trademarks.
International recognition.
All concerts are recorded and broadcast in up to forty countries on Swiss Television (SF), Arte, Telebasel and 3sat networks (a potential audience of 150 million households). The majority of concerts are also broadcast on Switzerland's DRS1 and DRS3 radio stations.
In 2006 the festival’s first Eurovision broadcast took place with a show of Sir Elton John, followed by Katie Melua’s Europe-wide live broadcast in 2007. Additionally, the first live DVD featuring the show of Solomon Burke in 2003 was released in the same year. Since 2009 there is a live DVD of Jethro Tull's performance in 2008 on the market.
The AVO SESSION Basel has won first prize in the cultural category of the International Sponsorships Awards presented by the German sponsorship association FASPO.

HSC-25

Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Twenty Five (HSC-25) "Island Knights" is a United States Navy helicopter squadron based at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The "Island Knights" are the Navy's only forward deployed Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron. HSC-25 flies the MH-60S "Knighthawk" helicopter, manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation in Stratford, Connecticut.
History.
Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Twenty Five (HSC-25) was initially established as Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Five (HC-5) at NAS Agana, Guam on 03 FEB 1984. As the “Providers”, HC-5 flew the H-46D “Sea Knight,” moving to Andersen AFB in 1995 during the closure of NAS Agana. Redesignated as the “Island Knights” on 21 APR 2005, HSC-25 provides logistic support for the U.S. Pacific Fleet in the Navy’s newest helicopter, the MH-60S “Knighthawk”. The squadron employs approximately eighty officers and four hundred enlisted personnel to fly and maintain the fleet of 14 MH-60S.
HSC-25 is the first and only forward-deployed vertical replenishment (VERTREP) squadron in the Navy and is tasked with supporting Seventh Fleet units in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, North Arabian Sea, and Persian Gulf. To provide this support, HSC-25 embarks two-aircraft detachments aboard Military Sealift Command vessels which provide transportation of equipment, fuel, supplies and ammunition to sustain U.S. forces worldwide. In addition, the squadron was tasked in 1992 to provide a permanent Search and Rescue (SAR) detachment aboard the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3). In the spring of 1996, HSC-25 deployed their first night vision device capable amphibious SAR detachment to USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3). In the fall of 2000, the SAR detachment was permanently moved from the USS Belleau Wood to the USS Essex (LHD-2). In the winter of 2011, the SAR detachment was again permanently moved from the USS Essex (LHD 2) to the USS Bonhome Richard (LHD 6) whose homeport is Sasebo, Japan.
In the Fall of 2005, HSC-25 was again the first HSC Squadron to assume a new mission, providing essential Air Ambulance services for Coalition Forces, and Compotent Command (CFLCC) in Camp Buering, Kuwait.
The only Navy squadron on board Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, HSC-25 rapidly incorporated itself into “Team Andersen”. In addition to VERTREP, HSC-25 provides 24 hour (overland/over-water) SAR/Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) services for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Averaging over 30 rescues and 70 MEDEVACs per year, HSC-25 also conducts airborne firefighting utilizing externally carried buckets, Vertical Onboard Delivery (VOD), drone and torpedo recovery, special operations airborne support, and fleet logistics support for all military activities in the Guam area, including the Maritime Prepositioned Ships (MPS) operating in the local area.
Since February 1984, HSC-25 has moved millions of tons of supplies and ammunition, as well as thousands of personnel, providing much of the logistic power to the 7th and 5th Fleets. The aircraft of HSC-25 have operated as “angels of mercy” on numerous occasions, accomplishing emergency MEDEVAC and rescue missions and participating in Operations TRI-CRAB, Southern Watch, United Shield, Cobra Gold, Vigilant Sentinel, Tandem Thrust and most recently Unified Assistance, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom.
Insignia.
Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Twenty Five was established on 21 April 2005 upon the disestablishment of Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Five (HC-5). Originally commissioned on 3 February 1984, HC-5 had a reputation for exceptional service and support to the Fifth and Seventh Fleets and the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands. The HSC-25 insignia was developed to acknowledge the legacy and attempt to embrace the future of the squadron.
The trident held by the eagle symbolizes the emphasis being placed on the combat capabilities of the helicopter in the maritime environment as well as pays homage to the squadrons naval heritage. The loads hanging from the trident represent the past, present, and future missions of VERTREP. The five stars remain as a legacy to HC-5, and the globe is arranged to represent the squadron's Area of Operation and its service to the Pacific Fleet. The black background represents the expanding night capabilities of the squadrons pilots and aircraft.
Mission.
A part of Helicopter Sea Combat Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet (HSCWINGPAC), Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Twenty Five (HSC-25) is the Navy’s only forward deployed vertical replenishment squadron; providing deployed ships a rapid, safe and versatile means of re-supplying diminishing stores. Vertical replenishment at sea can occur without altering ship’s course or tactical position and precludes the necessity for connected replenishment, which is less desirable due to the increased manpower required to successfully complete the mission. HSC-25, also known as the “Island Knights”, is presently a tenant command on board Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, and has incorporated itself into “Team Andersen.” In addition to VERTREP, HSC-25 provides 24-hour Search and Rescue (SAR) and Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) services for Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. In 2002, the HSC-25 Island Knights launched on 63 SAR missions resulting in the recovery of 7 individuals and 18 MEDEVACS. HSC-25 additionally supports heliborne firefighting for the local area, Vertical Onboard Delivery and fleet logistics support for deployed units in the Guam area.
Aircraft.

Ink Exchange

Ink Exchange is an urban fantasy novel written by Melissa Marr. It is set in the same universe as Marr's previous novel, "Wicked Lovely", but is not a sequel; rather, it is a companion novel that focuses on a different set of characters. Though only a companion novel, its plot elements connect chronologically to Marr's following novel, "Fragile Eternity".
Plot summary.
The prologue of "Ink Exchange" revisits a scene from "Wicked Lovely" narrated by Irial, King of the Dark Court, in which he walks into a tattoo shop with Leslie, a 17 year-old human. The novel then follows Leslie as she prepares for a normal day of school. Leslie's alcoholic father and Ren, her drug-dealing brother, neglect her. Having once been drugged and raped by Ren's customers,to cover one of his debts, Leslie fears her family, yet still pays the bills by working as a waitress. When Leslie reaches school, she is suspicious of how well Aislinn, the protagonist from "Wicked Lovely", has adjusted to her new life as a faery. Aislinn, though once human, is the Summer Queen in the world of the fey, a world which she tries desperately to keep from Leslie.
The novel then begins to follow Irial. It is revealed that the Dark Court feeds off emotions such as anger, hate, lust and pain to stay strong. When one of his own is killed by a simple human bullet, Irial is desperate for a way to protect his kind. With the help of his "left hand" Gabriel and his pack of "Hounds," he keeps his own and other courts in check. When confronted with numerous rebellions, Irial decides to pursue an ink exchange with a mortal to provide a constant stream of emotion to feed his court. When Leslie, the chosen mortal, gets a tattoo, the traditional tattoo ink is exchanged with the Dark Court's blood and tears, thereby joining the Dark King and the mortal.
Soon, as an effect of the ink exchange, Leslie begins to feel and see as Irial would, seeing past faeries' human disguises. When she falls in love with Niall she avoids admitting her connection to his world. Her connection to the faeries deepens when she returns to the tattoo shop and begins to hear Irial's voice in her head. Irial has come to the conclusion that he loves her, and refuses to let any harm come to her. When Leslie goes to a club to celebrate her finished tattoo with Seth and Niall, Irial begins to speak through her to deflect the advances of other faeries. In the club, Irial and Leslie finally unite, connected by a shadow vine that represents the ink exchange. Niall, still in love, soon tells Leslie that he can help her break the bond with Irial, should she ever want to. 
Over the next few weeks, Leslie blurs in and out of consciousness, incapable of leaving Irial's side for more than a minute. When Leslie begins to understand that Irial is feeding on her negative emotions, leaving her incapable of feeling them, she realizes he has taken away her freedom to live. In an attempt to produce in Leslie more pain to feed his court, Irial and his faeries murder several human companions at once, displaying them in scenes from plays, a gross attempt at humor. When Leslie asks Niall to help free her, he uses sunlight and frost taken from the Winter and Summer Queens to burn and freeze the link and the tattoo off Leslie. 
Before restoring her human life and leaving the faerie world behind, Leslie goes to Irial one last time, asking him never to use the ink exchange on another human again. He solemnly agrees. The novel ends with Irial making Niall the new king of the dark court and them both watching Leslie and her new human friends.
Reception.
"Ink Exchange" was a New York Times Bestseller in 2008, a 2008 Book Sense Pick, and Locus Recommended Reading for 2009.

Casay, Antique

Casay is a barangay (village) in Anini-y, Antique, Philippines. It is located 10 kilometers east of Anini-y town.
Located between the barangays of Mabuyong in the west and Iba and Casay Viejo (old Casay, former part of Casay but later it was separated and was recognized as a new barangay) in the northeast. At the east and south is the seashore overlooking the Negros Island, Sipalay and the vast Sulu Sea. And at the north is Igpalge and Igbarabatuan. Visitors from other provinces often mistook Casay for a town, when in fact it is just a barangay. Part of the reason is the unique beauty and location of the place. Indeed, Casay is a scenic place located between the Sulu sea and the mountains of southern Antique. A congressman once referred to Casay as a "showcase Barangay of Antique".
There is another barangay created and named after Casay, the barangay of New Casay, in the municipality of Braulio E. Dujali, Davao del Norte Province in Mindanao, whose residents include, among others, former Casay residents and those from the neighboring barangays under the Parish of St. Therese of Avila of Casay and from other towns in Antique Province. It used to be that New Casay also celebrates its barangay fiesta in honor of St. Therese of Avila every October 15.
Name Origination.
Casay took its name from a large number of trees that grew there which is
called casay, though casay trees can now only be sparingly seen in the area.
Population.
The people of Casay are called "Casaynons". They are mostly friendly, jolly, religious, and courteous, especially to visitors. The people are predominantly Christians and are genuinely proud of their Roman Catholic heritage. Casay has a good number of professionals and OFW's (overseas Filipino workers) consisted mostly of seafarers, domestic helpers, carpenters, etc. Almost every household has a member who is an OFW. Literacy rate is high as Casay has an elementary school and a private (Catholic) high school, the St. Therese's High School. Most common industry is farming and fishing, including milkfish fry-catching during summer.
Celebrations.
Casay holds an annual fiesta for the patron saint, St. Therese of Avila on 
the 15th of October, but celebration starts on the 13th of October.
The Parish of Casay.
The Parish of St. Therese of Avila was founded on 1901, by a Mill Hill missionary priest Fr. Antonio Smale (who died in the same year and buried within the parish church near the altar). It celebrated the 100th year as a parish on the 15th of May 2006.

Phillip Boa

Phillip Boa (born Ernst Ulrich Figgen, 18 January 1963 in Dortmund, Germany) is a German independent music singer, guitarist and composer. His current name is unknown after two divorces and name changes. Phillip Boa lives in Dortmund, Hamburg and on the island of Malta. He has received several "Album & Single of the Week" awards in British magazines like NME, Sounds or Melody Maker. The style of the Voodooclub was described by NME in a review as "a cross between B52's and Captain Beefheart". The style of his lyrics is a mix of irony, love songs, sarcasm, often of bizarre and deranged content.
Music.
In 1985, he founded the independent band "Phillip Boa & The Voodooclub". With their album "Hair" and the single "Container Love", they experienced a commercial breakthrough and international recognition in 1989.
Boa's music is influenced by British punk rock and New Wave, its style swings between pop and avantgarde. A continuous charasteric are the catchy and melodic choruses, interrupted or alienated by atmospheric shifts. Thereby the voice of band member Pia Lund and Boa's own throaty singing contrast diametrically. After his most successful album so far, "Boaphenia" (1993), Boa made a deliberate musical cut to focus on a Metal project when founded the heavy metal band Voodoocult, consisting of members Dave Lombardo (drums), Chuck Schuldiner (guitar), Waldemar Sorychta (guitar), Mille Petrozza (guitar) and himself as vocalist.
The autumn of 2006 saw Boa and his Voodooclub start their "Remastered" tour. They consequently only played songs from the three re-published albums "Copperfield", "Hair" and "Hispañola". Moreover, since 2001, they play two or three annual Christmas concerts at the Leipzig "Moritzbastei" fortress. On 3 August 2007, the album "Faking to Blend In" was released on Motor Music.
In 2009, the Voodooclub teamed up with Can drummer Jaki Liebezeit, who played percussion and drums on their album "Diamonds Fall". Boa's latest release is called "Loyalty" and brought him a commercial comeback in Germany (No.13 in the album charts) and some other countries. The album was produced by David Vella and Brian Viglione, who also played drums and other instruments on the album. "Loyalty" was mixed by Ian Grimble and mastered by Frank Arkwright at Abbey Road Studios.
Reception.
Several of Boa's albums have reached the top 30 of the German Media Control Charts. In 2012, British music journalist John Robb called Phillip Boa and the Voodoo Club "one of the best German bands of the last three decades".
In their song "Wir sind die Besten" (We are the Best), the German band Die Ärzte sing about Phillip Boa, depicting themselves and Boa as the last true musicians.

Antichrist (film)

Antichrist is a 2009 Danish art film written and directed by Lars von Trier, starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. It follows horror film conventions and tells the story of a couple who, after the death of their child, retreat to a cabin in the woods where the man experiences strange visions and the woman manifests increasingly violent sexual behaviour and sadism. The narrative is divided into a prologue, four chapters and an epilogue. The film was primarily a Danish production but co-produced by companies from six different European countries. It was filmed in Germany and Sweden.
After premiering at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, where Gainsbourg won the festival's award for Best Actress, the film immediately caused controversy, with critics generally praising the film's artistic execution but strongly divided regarding its substantive merit. Other awards won by the film include the Robert Award for best Danish film, The Nordic Council Film Prize for best Nordic film and the European Film Award for best cinematography. The film is dedicated to the Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky (1932–86).
Plot.
Prologue: With background music "Lascia ch'io pianga" from Handel's "Rinaldo" (1711). A couple's young son, Nick, falls from a window to his death on the snowy ground below while his parents (who remain unnamed throughout the film) passionately make love.
Chapter One: Grief: During Nick's funeral, the wife collapses. The other mourners gather around her, their faces blurred. Spending the next month in the hospital, in and out of consciousness and with little concept of time, she awakens crippled with grief. Her husband, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her with psychotherapy. After a less-than-fruitful period at home, during which she tries to free herself from the pain of her child's death and dependence on psychiatric drugs, he decides to try exposure therapy. In an isolated cabin in the woods (appropriately called Eden) where she spent time with Nick the previous summer while writing a thesis on Gynocide, he learns that her greatest fear centers on the structure and the surrounding vegetation. During the journey to Eden, while she sleeps, he encounters a deer which shows no fear of him. As the deer turns to leave he sees a dead fawn hanging halfway out of the womb.
Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns): The couple continue towards the cabin. Upon encountering a footbridge, she is overcome with fear. She hesitates and then sprints across the bridge and into the woods, leaving him to follow after her. During sessions of psychotherapy she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic. The environment surrounding the cabin also becomes increasingly sinister. As acorns pelt the cabin like rapid gunfire, he awakens to find his hand covered in swollen ticks, and at the conclusion of this chapter he comes across a self-disemboweling fox which utters the words "chaos reigns."
Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide): He finds his wife's thesis studies: pictures of witch-hunts and a scrapbook filled with articles and notes on misogynist topics. Her writing becomes more frantic and illegible as the pages go on. It is revealed that, while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. He is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. She asks him to hit her during sex. At first he resists, but when she flees into the woods and begins masturbating underneath a large tree he chases after her and half-heartedly complies. While they make love numerous hands are seen emerging from the roots of the tree. He goes on to study Nick's autopsy report which states the bones in both of the child's feet were oddly deformed. The doctors at the time did not assign any importance to this fact as it was unrelated to the child's death. Finding numerous photographs of Nick in which his boots are on the wrong feet, he becomes increasingly agitated. This bizarre revelation has sinister undertones regarding his wife, who had been alone with the boy at the time the pictures were taken. At this moment she attacks him and accuses him of planning to leave her. She disrobes, mounts him, and then unexpectedly crushes his testicles with a block of wood. While he is unconscious from the pain, she goes on to masturbate him until he orgasms, ejaculating blood. Then, to prevent him from leaving, she drills a hole through his leg and bolts a heavy grindstone through the wound. She tosses the wrench she used under the cabin where he cannot find it. He wakes up, finds himself alone, and drags himself outside. He hears her screaming for him, so he drags himself into a foxhole to hide. As she searches for him he finds a crow buried alive in the foxhole. The crow starts cawing loudly and repetitively, which lets her find his hiding spot. He beats the crow over and over, but it will not die. She finds him and tries to pull him out. She is unsuccessful and goes on to retrieve a shovel to inflict more pain while he lies in the fox hole, now partially buried alive.
Chapter Four: The Three Beggars: Several hours pass. Night falls, and she apologizes to him, weeping profusely. She tries to find the wrench to unbolt the grindstone, but cannot locate it. With a joint effort they are able to drag him back inside the cabin. He asks her if she wanted to kill him and she answers "not yet", adding cryptically that "when the three beggars arrive someone must die." There is a flashback to an alternate view of the prologue in which she sees what was about to happen to Nick and does not act. It is unclear whether this is meant to be reality or merely an imagined vision symptomatic of extreme guilt. She then takes a pair of scissors and severs her clitoris while masturbating, letting out a tortured scream. During the night the couple are visited by the crow, the deer, and the fox. Hail beats against the roof of the cabin. Earlier it had been revealed that women in Ratisbon had been accused of witchcraft and had been known to have the power to summon hailstorms. The crow is heard making the same cawing sound beneath the floorboards of the cabin. Breaking through the floor he frees the bird and discovers the wrench. At this moment she stabs him in the back with a pair of scissors, but he is still able to remove the grindstone. She stops fighting him after noticing a change of look in his eyes. He strangles her to death and burns her body on a funeral pyre outside the cabin.
Epilogue: With background music again from "Lascia ch'io pianga", he makes his way from the cabin, eating wild berries, as the three beggars look on. Upon reaching the top of a hill he looks down to see hundreds of women ascending towards him, their faces blurred.
Cast.
The baby Nick was played by Storm Acheche Sahlstrøm. Body doubles for Dafoe and Gainsbourg were used in the most explicit scenes; the professional porn actors Horst Stramka and Mandy Starship were employed for that task.
Production.
Development.
"Antichrist" started with the idea of making a horror film. Lars von Trier thought it was a good idea to start with a certain genre, and chose horror cinema because "the genre such that you can put a lot of very, very strange images in a horror film". He had recently seen several contemporary Japanese horror films such as "Ring" and "Dark Water", from which he drew inspiration. Another basic idea came from a documentary Von Trier saw about the original forests of Europe. In the documentary the forests were portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the different species tried to kill and eat each other. Von Trier was fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature as a romantic and peaceful place. Von Trier said: "At the same time that we hang it on our walls over the fireplace or whatever, it represents pure Hell." In retrospect he said that he had become unsure whether "Antichrist" really could be classified as a horror film, because "it's not so horrific ... we didn't try so hard to do shocks, and that is maybe why it is not a horror film. I took horror genre more as an inspiration, and then this strange story came out of it."
The title was the first thing that was written for the film. "Antichrist" was originally scheduled for production in 2005, but its executive producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen accidentally revealed the film's planned revelation: that Earth was created by Satan and not by God. Von Trier was furious and decided to delay the shoot so he could rewrite the script.
In 2007 Von Trier announced that he was suffering from depression, and that it was possible that he never would be able to make another film. "I assume that "Antichrist" will be my next film. But right now I don't know," he told the Danish newspaper "Politiken". During an early casting attempt, English actors who had come to Copenhagen had to be sent home, while Von Trier was crying because his poor condition did not allow him to meet them.
The post-depression version of the script was to some extent written as an exercise for Von Trier, to see if he had recovered enough to be able to work again. Von Trier has also made references to August Strindberg and his "Inferno" Crisis in the 1890s, comparing it to his own writing under difficult mental circumstances: "was "Antichrist" my Inferno Crisis?" Several notable names appear in the credits as having assisted Von Trier in the writing. Danish writer and directors Per Fly and Nikolaj Arcel are listed as script consultants, and Anders Thomas Jensen as story supervisor. Also credited are researchers dedicated to fields including "misogyny", "anxiety", "horror films" and "theology." Von Trier himself is a Catholic convert and intensely interested in Christian symbolism and theology.
Production was led by Von Trier's Copenhagen-based company Zentropa. Co-producers were Sweden's Film i Väst, Italy's Lucky Red and France's Liberator Productions, Slot Machine and Arte France. The Danish Film Institute contributed with a financial support of $1.5 million and Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen in Germany with $1.3 million. The total budget was around $11 million.
Pre-production.
Props for the more violent scenes were provided by the company Soda ApS, and made in their workshop in Nørrebro, Copenhagen. Plaster casts were made of Willem Dafoe's leg and the female "porno double's" sexual organ. A plastic baby with authentic weight was made for the opening sequence. Pictures found using Google Image Search had to serve as models for the stillborn deer, and a nylon stocking was used as caul. The vulva prop was constructed with its inner parts detachable for easy preparation if several takes would be needed. Czech animal trainer Ota Bares, who had collaborated with parts of the crew in the 2005 film "Adam's Apples", was hired early on and given instructions about what tasks the animals must be able to perform. The fox, for example, was taught to open its mouth on a given command to simulate speaking movements.
To get into the right mood before filming started, both Dafoe and Gainsbourg were shown Andrei Tarkovsky's "The Mirror" from 1975. Dafoe was also shown Von Trier's own 1998 film "The Idiots", and Gainsbourg "The Night Porter" to study Charlotte Rampling's character. Dafoe also met therapists working with cognitive behavioral therapy as well as being present at actual sessions of exposure therapy and studying material on the topic. Von Trier himself is highly skeptical of psychotherapy.
Filming.
Filming took 40 days to finish, from 20 August to the end of September 2008. The film was shot in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Locations were used in Rhein-Sieg-Kreis, part of the Cologne region, and Wuppertal. It was the first film by Lars von Trier to be entirely filmed in Germany. The fictional setting of the film however is near Seattle, USA. The film was shot on digital video, primarily using Red One cameras in 4K resolution. The slow motion sequences were shot with a Phantom V4 in 1,000 frames per second. Filming techniques involved dollys, hand-held camerawork and computer-programmed "motion control", of which the team had previous experience from Von Trier's 2006 film "The Boss of It All". One shot, where the couple is copulating under a tree, was particularly difficult since the camera would switch from being hand-held to motion controlled in the middle of the take.
Von Trier had not recovered completely from his depression when filming started. He repeatedly excused himself to the actors for being in the mental condition he was, and was not able to operate the camera as he usually does, which made him very frustrated. "The script was filmed and finished without much enthusiasm, made as it was using about half of my physical and intellectual capacity," the director said in an interview.
Post-production.
Post-production was primarily located in Warsaw, Poland, and Gothenburg, Sweden. Over the time of two months, the Poles contributed with about 4,000 hours of work and the Swedes 500. The film features 80 shots with computer-generated imagery, provided by the Polish company Platige Image. Most of these shots consist of digitally removed details such as the collar and leash used to lead the deer, but some were more complicated. The scene where the fox utters the words "chaos reigns" was particularly difficult to make. The mouth movements had to be entirely 3D animated in order to synchronise with the sound. The scene in Chapter Three during which the couple makes love and numerous hands emerge from the roots of a tree was subsequently adapted into the principal promotional art for the film.
The aria "Lascia ch'io pianga" from Handel's opera "Rinaldo" is used as the film's main musical theme. The aria has previously been used in other films such as "Farinelli", a 1994 biographical film about the castrato singer Farinelli. The eight-track soundtrack features both versions of "Lascia ch'io pianga" and selected extracts of the "score" created by sound designer Kristian Eidnes Andersen.
Release.
The film premiered during the Competition portion of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival to a polarized response from the audience. At least four people fainted during the preview due to the film's explicit violence. At the press conference following the screening, von Trier was asked by a journalist from the "Daily Mail" to justify why he made the film, to which the director responded that he found the question strange since he considered the audience as his guests, "not the other way around." He then claimed to be the best director in the world. Charlotte Gainsbourg won the Cannes Film Festival's award for Best Actress. The ecumenical jury at the Cannes festival gave the film a special "anti-award" and declared the film to be "the most misogynist movie from the self-proclaimed biggest director in the world". Cannes festival director Thierry Frémaux responded that this was a "ridiculous decision that borders on a call for censorship" and that it was "scandalous coming from an 'ecumenical' jury". The "talking fox" was nominated for the Palm Dog, but lost to Dug from "Up".
Two versions were available for buyers at the Cannes film market, nicknamed the "Catholic" and "Protestant" versions, where the former had some of the most explicit scenes removed while the latter was uncut. The uncut version was released theatrically to a general audience on 20 May 2009 in Denmark. It was acquired for British distribution by Artificial Eye and American by IFC Films.
In both Ireland and the United Kingdom, "Antichrist" was released uncut with an 18 certificate. The British Advertising Standards Authority received seven complaints about the film poster, which was based on the original poster and shows the couple as they are having sexual intercourse. The organization decided to approve the poster, finding it to not be pornographic since its "dark tone" made it "unlikely to cause sexual excitement". An alternative poster, featuring only quotes from reviews and no image at all, was used in outdoor venues and as an alternative for publishers who desired it.
The film received a limited theatrical run in Australia followed by a basic DVD release in early 2010. Sale of the DVD was strictly limited in South Australia due to new laws that place restrictions on films with an R18+ classification. A notable feature of the Australian release was the creation of a critically acclaimed poster that made prominent use of a pair of rusty scissors that had the actor's faces fused into the handles. The poster received much international coverage at the end of 2009 and was used as the local DVD cover.
This film was released on DVD and Blu-ray as part of The Criterion Collection on 9 November 2010.
The film was not submitted to the MPAA because the filmmakers feared that it would receive an NC-17 rating for its graphic violence.
Versions of the film.
According to a correspondence between an Amazon.com Customer Reviewer and Karen Mesoznik, staff member at The Criterion Collection, the version released by Criterion Collection on Blu-ray and DVD is in fact the uncut, so-called "Protestant Version" which has a run time of 108 minutes. The cut, so-called "Catholic Version", has a run time of between 100 and 104 minutes (approximately). The long rumored, 120 minute version (supposedly released in France) is nothing more than a packaging misprint on the French DVD release.
Reception.
In Denmark, the film quickly became successful with both critics and audiences. "Politiken" called it "a grotesque masterpiece," giving it a perfect score of 6 out of 6, and praised it for being completely unconventional while at the same time being "a profoundly serious, very personal ... piece of art about small things like sorrow, death, sex and the meaninglessness of everything." "Berlingske Tidende" gave it a rating of 4 out of 6 and praised the "peerless imagery," and how "cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle effectively switches between Dogme-like hand-held scenes and wonderful stylized tableaux." An exception was Claus Christensen, editor of the Danish film magazine "Ekko". Christensen accused the other Danish critics of overrating the film, himself calling it "a master director's failed work." Around 83,000 tickets were sold in Denmark during the theatrical run, the best performance by a Lars von Trier film since "Dogville". The film was nominated by Denmark for The Nordic Council Film Prize, which it won. "Antichrist" went on to sweep the Robert Awards, Denmark's main national film awards, by winning in seven categories: Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematographer, Best Editing, Best Lighting Design and Best Special Effects.
However, "Antichrist" polarized critical opinion in the United States. , the film had a 49% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5 out of 10. (Its summary: "Gruesome, explicit and highly controversial; Lars von Trier's arthouse-horror, though beautifully shot, is no easy ride.") Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying:
Chris Tookey for the British tabloid "Daily Mail" started his review by noting that the film contains "a few images of startling beauty," but soon went on to call it "offensively misogynistic" and "needlessly graphic." He also listed other films that preceded "Antichrist" in showing explicit sex, genital self-mutilation and "women torturing men for pleasure," eventually giving the film one star out of five. In the British film magazine "Empire", film critic Kim Newman gave the film four stars out of five and noted that "Von Trier’s self-conscious arrogance is calculated to split audiences into extremist factions, but "Antichrist" delivers enough beauty, terror and wonder to qualify as the strangest and most original horror movie of the year."
In Australia's The Monthly, film critic Luke Davies viewed the film as "a bleak but entrancing film that explores guilt, grief and many things besides ... that will anger as many people as it pleases", describing Von Trier's "command of the visually surreal" as "truly exceptional". Davies described the film as "very good and very flawed", conceding "it is not easy to understand the meaning or intention of specific images and details of the film" but still concludes that "there’s something neurotic and reactionary in the controversy and near-hysteria surrounding the film."
Film director John Waters hailed "Antichrist" as one of the ten best films of 2009 in Artforum Magazine, stating "If Ingmar Bergman had committed suicide, gone to hell, and come back to earth to direct an exploitation/art film for drive-ins, ["Antichrist"] is the movie he would have made."
The film won the award for Best Cinematographer at the 2009 European Film Awards, shared with "Slumdog Millionaire" as both films were shot by Anthony Dod Mantle. It was nominated for Best Director and Best Actress but the awards lost to Michael Haneke for "The White Ribbon" and Kate Winslet for "The Reader" respectively.
Accolades.
Festivals
Video game.
According to a June 2009 article in the Danish newspaper "Politiken", a video game called "Eden", based on the film, was in the works. It was to start where the film ended. "It will be a self-therapeutic journey into your own darkest fears, and will break the boundaries of what you can and can't do in video games," said video game director Morten Iversen. As of 2011, Zentropa Games are out of business and "Eden" has been cancelled.

Toby Lee Series

The Toby Lee Series was an Australian motor racing series run at Oran Park Raceway in Sydney, between 1970 and 1975.
In 1970 Oran Park, with backing from sponsors Toby Lee (a brand of shirts) and department store Grace Brothers, launched a new series of races for Group E Series Production sedans. The "Toby Lee Series" usually featured a 100 lap final round and quickly became very popular, attracting large crowds to Oran Park.
The series featured a number of leading Sydney-based drivers, such as Holden Dealer Team driver Colin Bond, emerging Ford privateer John Goss, Ford stalwart Fred Gibson and Chrysler drivers Leo Geoghegan and Doug Chivas. The Toby Lee played its part in popularising production sedan racing and in establishing the passionate Holden-Ford rivalry that would endure for decades to come.
After three years of racing under Series Production regulations (1970–1972) the Toby Lee Series switched to Sports Sedans during the 1973 and 1974 seasons. 1973 saw competitive racing with big fields. Leading contenders included John Harvey and Colin Bond in Torana Repco V8s, Bill Brown and Jim McKeown driving Porsche Carreras, Leo Geoghegan's Porsche 911S, and Allan Moffat's famous Trans-Am Mustang. But when John McCormack rolled out his highly modified Ansett Charger Repco V8 in 1974 it dominated the series. This led to a lessening of interest in the series and the fields dwindled in the second half of 1974.
For its final year of 1975 a radical switch was made away from sedan racing altogether and the Toby Lee became an open-wheeler Formula 5000 series. Max Stewart's Lola T400 won the 1975 series from the Matich A53 of John Goss.

Canon EOS 50D

The Canon EOS 50D is a 15.1-megapixel digital single-lens reflex camera. It is part of the Canon EOS line of cameras, succeeding the EOS 40D and preceding the EOS 60D.
Canon announced the camera on 26 August 2008. The camera was released on 6 October 2008.
Overview and features.
The 50D has many similar characteristics to its predecessor, the 40D. This includes various shooting modes, the ability to change ISO and white balance, a pop-up flash unit, and an LCD screen. The LCD screen is the same size (3.0") as the 40D but has a higher resolution (920k pixels) than any previous model. It is also the final Canon xxD to use a CompactFlash or Microdrive for memory storage, along with the BP-511 series battery.
The 50D has a higher pixel count (15.1 megapixels), hence higher shooting resolutions, than its predecessor and, like the 40D, has a 14-bit RAW format.
The camera has Live View, which allows photographers to use the LCD screen as the viewfinder. Because the sensor mirror needs to be in the locked position (see Live preview), shutter noise is reduced in this mode.
Improvements.
Changes over the 40D include a higher-resolution sensor (15.1 megapixel instead of 10.1 megapixel).
The ISO goes up to 3200 in standard mode, and can be increased to 12800 through the use of a custom function. The burst rate is the same as on the 40D, 6.3 frames per second, though the 40D was advertised as 6.5.
The camera uses Canon's DIGIC 4 image processor. The processor delivers more responsive operation, improved color rendition and near-instant start-up time. A new sensor cleaning system has also been introduced. The camera can also use the Canon Wireless File Transmitter WFT-E3/E3A.
The 50D has a 3" screen – the same size as the 40D – but the resolution is 640×480 pixels, which allows it to show more image detail than any of Canon's previous 3" LCD displays. The 50D features two new Autofocus Modes in Liveview and an HDMI port.
The 50D is offered as a body only or in a package with a new EF-S 18-200mm 3.5-5.6 IS lens or EF 28–135 3.5-5.6 IS USM lens.
Image quality and noise.
The 50D adds 5 megapixels to an APS-C sized sensor (compared to the 40D), and as a result the size of the individual photosensors has decreased. To offset the increased noise that inevitably results from smaller photosensors, Canon eliminated the gaps between the microlenses covering the photosensors. Thus the microlenses are larger, and capture more light and direct it to the sensor sites.
Reception.
The Canon EOS 50D received generally favourable reviews. "Digital Photography Review" concluded: "Looking at the specification differences between the EOS 40D and our test candidate it appears you pay quite a premium for the 50D's extra megapixels and as we've found out during this review you don't get an awful lot of extra image quality for your money. The Canon EOS 50D still earns itself our highest reward but considering its price point and our slight concerns about its pixel-packed sensor, it only does so by a whisker." Gordon Laing of "CameraLabs.com" had a slightly better view of the camera, noting that "Canon’s bold claims of matching the noise levels of the earlier EOS 40D were confirmed in our High ISO tests," and concluded by calling it "a very capable DSLR that handles confidently, delivers great results and is a joy to use. . . . to exploit that high resolution you’ll need to couple it with a decent quality lens."
Magic Lantern Video.
As of 2013 there has been Magic Lantern (firmware) development of 50D video support. The 50D compares favorable to many later Canon APS-C models in terms of light sensitivity: ""The camera is also a totally unbelievable low light performer. The 50D was designed before the megapixel race really took off. It has a 15MP APS-C sensor, so individual pixels are much larger than those on the later 18MP Rebel CMOS sensors."". In addition to raw video, the Magic Lantern hack also enabled high bitrate compressed H.264 video at 30 frames per second, which had been disabled in official 50D firmware. Other publications, while impressed, pointed out downsides such as no audio, expensive fast CF-cards and hacks lacking manufacturer support.

Central conceit

In drama and other art forms, the central conceit of a work of fiction is the underlying fictitious assumption which must be accepted by the audience with suspension of disbelief so the plot may be seen as plausible. 
An example from popular culture is the way many cartoons feature animals that can speak to each other, and in many cases can understand human speech, but humans cannot understand the speech of animals. This conceit is seen, and sometimes exploited for plot purposes, in such films as "Over the Hedge", the "Balto" series, and "Brother Bear".

Papaflessia

Papaflessia () is an annual international athletics meeting that is held in Kalamata, Greece. The meeting falls within the European Athletic Association's calendar of meeting. The event caters to both men and women and athletic events held at the meeting include sprints, high jump, long jump, triple jump and javelin.
Papaflessia was named in honour of Papaflessas, a Greek priest and celebrated military leader who died at the Battle of Maniaki during the Greek Revolution. The meeting was inaugurated in 1954 and was held at the stadium of Messiniakos until 1968, when a military coup d'état ceased festivities. The athletics meeting was revived in 1984 and events held in the Kalamata Metropolitan Stadium were mainly contested between local athletes. In 1994 the meeting expanded to include international athletes. Past participants include Olympic gold medallists Stefka Kostadinova and Yelena Yelesina and English sprinters Dwain Chambers and John Regis.

Lowood Airfield Circuit

The Lowood Airfield Circuit was a motor racing venue in Queensland, Australia which was used from 1946 to 1966. It was located at a former wartime airfield site at Mount Tarampa, near Lowood, 72 km west of the state capital Brisbane. The circuit utilised the airfield’s runway for its 1.9 km long 200 metre wide main straight and also used various taxiways and tarmac from the old hangar area. Lap distance was .
The circuit was first used in June 1946 for the running of the Queensland Grand Prix, however it hosted only occasional meetings between then and 1956. In that year the Queensland Racing Drivers’ Club took over the site, hosting their first meeting there in November and subsequently developing the circuit into Queensland’s premier motor racing venue. The circuit was closed in November 1966.
Australian Drivers Championship.
Rounds of the Australian Drivers' Championship were held at Lowood each year from 1957 to 1962.
Australian Tourist Trophy.
Lowood twice hosted the nation’s premier sports car race, the Australian Tourist Trophy.

La Queue du Marsupilami

La queue du Marsupilami, written by Greg and drawn by Franquin and his collaborator Batem, is a comic album relating the adventures of the fictional character Marsupilami. This album is the number 1 in the series of Marsupilami albums, published by Marsu Productions.
History.
With the album "La queue du Marsupilami", a new series is launched by Franquin entirely dedicated to the adventures of Marsupilami, who only appeared as a secondary character in the Spirou and Fantasio comics series. This album sold more than 600.000 copies. 
From 1987, one album was published each year. This first album was reedited three times, in 1991, 1997 and 2007. The creation of this new series was also forced by legal reasons: when Franquin left the publishing company Dupuis to start on his own Marsu Productions, he brought his own creations Marsupilami and Gaston Lagaffe along with him, but had to leave the older characters Spirou and Fantasio at Dupuis. Thus, the characters could no longer have common adventures.
Story.
In the Palombia jungle, Bring M. Backalive, a hunter who seeks personal glory, searches for a marsupilami, an animal that nobody had never captured. The hunter's attempts are occasions for some gags. The tone is largely humoristic and the hunter rather a comic character than a dangerous man. The story is also an opportunity to discover the way of life and the several abilities of the marsupilamis including the ejector paws and elongating tails.

Koolhoven F.K.46

The Koolhoven F.K.46 was a 1930s Dutch training biplane designed and built by Koolhoven.
The F.K.46 was a two-seat biplane with fixed tailwheel landing gear and tandem open cockpits. The prototype first flew in 1933 powered by a Cirrus Hermes engine. A second prototype was fitted with a sliding cockpit canopy. The aircraft entered limited production and four were used by the Nationale Luchtvaart School (Dutch National Flying School). One aircraft was evaluated by the Dutch Army. In 1935 a reduced weight version designated F.K.46L was built powered by a 95hp (71kW) Walter Minor engine but only one was built.
Most of the F.K.46s did not survive the German-invasion in May 1940, although one was sent to South Africa for an evaluation by the South African Air Force although it was expensive compared with the de Havilland Tiger Moth. The surviving aircraft was later impressed into service with the South African Air Force.

Loop variant

In computer science, a loop variant is a mathematical function defined on the state space of a computer program whose value is monotonically decreased with respect to a (strict) well-founded relation by the iteration of a while loop under some invariant conditions, thereby ensuring its termination. A loop variant whose range is restricted to the non-negative integers is also known as a bound function, because in this case it provides a trivial upper bound on the number of iterations of a loop before it terminates. However, a loop variant may be transfinite, and thus is not necessarily restricted to integer values.
A well-founded relation is characterized by the existence of a minimal element of every non-empty subset of its domain. The existence of a variant proves the termination of a while loop in a computer program by well-founded descent. A basic property of a well-founded relation is that it has no infinite descending chains. Therefore a loop possessing a variant will terminate after a finite number of iterations, as long as its body terminates each time.
A while loop, or, more generally, a computer program that may contain while loops, is said to be totally correct if it is partially correct and it terminates.
Rule of inference for total correctness.
In order to formally state the rule of inference for the termination of a while loop we have demonstrated above, recall that in Floyd–Hoare logic, the rule for expressing the partial correctness of a while loop is:
where "I" is the "invariant", "C" is the "condition", and "S" is the "body" of the loop. To express total correctness, we write instead:
where, in addition, "V" is the "variant", and by convention the unbound symbol "z" is taken to be universally quantified.
Every loop that terminates has a variant.
The existence of a variant implies that a while loop terminates. It may seem surprising, but the converse is true, as well, as long as we assume the axiom of choice: every while loop that terminates (given its invariant) has a variant. To prove this, assume that the loop
terminates given the invariant "I" where we have the total correctness assertion
Consider the "successor" relation on the state space formula_5 induced by the execution of the statement "S" from a state satisfying both the invariant "I" and the condition "C". That is, we say that a state formula_6 is a "successor" of formula_7 if and only if
We note that formula_11 for otherwise the loop would fail to terminate.
Next consider the reflexive, transitive closure of the "successor" relation. Call this "iteration": we say that a state formula_6 is an "iterate" of formula_7 if either formula_14 or there is a finite chain formula_15 such that formula_16 formula_17 and formula_18 is a "successor" of formula_19 for all "i", formula_20
We note that if formula_7 and formula_6 are two distinct states, and formula_6 is an iterate of formula_7, then formula_7 cannot be an iterate of formula_26 for again, otherwise the loop would fail to terminate. In other words, iteration is antisymmetric, and thus, a partial order.
Now, since the while loop terminates after a finite number of steps given the invariant "I", and no state has a successor unless "I" is true in that state, we conclude that every state has only finitely many iterates, every descending chain with respect to iteration has only finitely many distinct values, and thus there is no infinite descending chain, i.e. loop iteration satisfies the descending chain condition.
Therefore—assuming the axiom of choice—the "successor" relation we originally defined for the loop is well-founded on the state space formula_27 since it is strict (irreflexive) and contained in the "iterate" relation. Thus the identity function on this state space is a variant for the while loop, as we have shown that the state must strictly decrease—as a "successor" and an "iterate"—each time the body "S" is executed given the invariant "I" and the condition "C".
Moreover, we can show by a counting argument that the existence of any variant implies the existence of a variant in ω1, the first uncountable ordinal, i.e.,
This is because the collection of all states reachable by a finite computer program in a finite number of steps from a finite input is countably infinite, and ω1 is the enumeration of all well-order types on countable sets.
Practical considerations.
In practice, loop variants are often taken to be non-negative integers, or even required to be so, but the requirement that every loop have an integer variant removes the expressive power of unbounded iteration from a programming language. Unless such a (formally verified) language allows a transfinite proof of termination for some other equally powerful construct such as a recursive function call, it is no longer capable of full μ-recursion, but only primitive recursion. Ackermann's function is the canonical example of a recursive function that cannot be computed in a loop with an integer variant.
In terms of their computational complexity, however, functions that are not primitive recursive lie far beyond the realm of what is usually considered tractable. Considering even the simple case of exponentiation as a primitive recursive function, and that the composition of primitive recursive functions is primitive recursive, one can begin to see how quickly a primitive recursive function can grow. And any function that can be computed by a Turing machine in a running time bounded by a primitive recursive function is itself primitive recursive. So it is difficult to imagine a practical use for full μ-recursion where primitive recursion will not do, especially since the former can be simulated by the latter up to exceedingly long running times.
And in any case, Kurt Gödel's first incompleteness theorem and the halting problem imply that there are while loops that always terminate but cannot be proven to do so; thus it is unavoidable that any requirement for a formal proof of termination must reduce the expressive power of a programming language. While we have shown that every loop that terminates has a variant, this does not mean that the well-foundedness of the loop iteration can be proven.
Example.
Here is an example, in C-like pseudocode, of an integer variant computed from some upper bound on the number of iterations remaining in a while loop. However, C allows side effects in the evaluation of expressions, which is unacceptable from the point of view of formally verifying a computer program.
Why even consider a non-integer variant?
Why even consider a non-integer or transfinite variant? This question has been raised because in all practical instances where we want to prove that a program terminates, we also want to prove that it terminates in a reasonable amount of time. There are at least two possibilities:

Wei Jun (c. 1827–1884) () born in Guangxi, Wei Changhui's brother's son, was a Chinese Colonel General during the Taiping Rebellion and later served as the general of the Taiping monarchy in the early and middle stages of the rebellion. He attacked the Wuchang District three times, and occupied the district successfully in 1855. In the third battle with Wuchang District, the 100,000 Taiping troops he commanded shot the Xiang Army's spirit master Luo Zenan, which disrupted Zeng Guofan and the Xiang Army.
Wei Jun's subordinate was Chen Yucheng in the beginning. 
Tianjing's struggle Incident happened on September 2, 1856, and Chen Yucheng did not obey Wei‘s orders, but retreated from Wuchang District in the autumn of 1859. He surrendered to Qing shortly thereafter at Chizhou. Qing accepted Wei's surrender and incorporated Wei's troops into his own. Some of these generals, such as Cheng Xuechi and Ding Ruchang, were surrendered by Wei in the battle of Anqing, 1861. The Qing government bore a grudge; three governors of Hubei were KIA or forced to suicide and Wei was forced to retire as just a colonel and lived in Wuhu.
Wei provided important information about Li Xiucheng and Chen Yucheng to Zeng Guoquan. 
Wei Jun's surrender was a catastrophic loss of military strategy for the Taiping Rebellion, worse than the Battle of the Scheldt and Battle of Wuhan(1938).

Plot.
Kitano plays Machisu, who is born into a wealthy family, but loses both his parents as a child. When his father (Akira Nakao) commits suicide after the collapse of his business, Machisu's stepmother (Mariko Tsutsui) sends him to live with an aunt and uncle who mistreat him and finally send him to an orphanage. As a young man, Machisu (Yurei Yanagi) attends art school and finds his style of painting challenged by the more experimental and conceptual work turned in by his classmates. Machisu takes a job in order to pay for art school, and strikes up a friendship with a fellow co-worker, Sachiko (Kumiko Aso), who seems to grasp his artistic vision. They get married and have a daughter. As he grows older, Mashisu's obsession with contemporary art controls his whole life, leaving him insensitive of everything around him, including the death of his own daughter (Eri Tokunaga) and his wife's desertion. He tries to please the art critics, remaining penniless. He is caught up in a fire and almost dies. Losing all his previous works, he is left with a single half-burnt soda can, which he assesses at 200,000 yen and tries to sell. This ends up kicked carelessly away when his wife picks him up from the street. They walk away together, seemingly finally rid of his artistic obsession.

Paule Vézelay

Paule Vézelay (1892–1984) was a British painter.
She was born Marjorie Watson-Williams in Bristol, a daughter of the pioneering ENT surgeon, Patrick Watson-Williams [1863-1938] Ref: http://www.swla.org.uk/8.html. Before the First World War she trained for a short period at the Slade and then at the London School of Art. She first gained recognition as a figurative painter, had her first London show in 1921 and was invited to join the London Group in 1922. She moved to France in 1926 and changed her name to Paule Vézelay possibly to identify herself with the School of Paris. In 1928 she abandoned figurative painting and made her first abstract work (which is now lost) and from then on worked exclusively in an abstract mode. She became well respected in modernist Parisian art circles and was elected in the 1930s to membership of the French abstract movement, Abstraction-Création, which was largely established as a reaction to Surrealism. 
On the outbreak of the Second World War she moved back to London, but had difficulty in gaining recognition by the British art establishment, possibly because of her identification with Paris at a time when the London art world was beginning to acquire its own separate and different reputation However, in 1952 she was invited by Andre Bloc, president of the Parisian constructivist abstract movement Groupe Espace, to form a London branch of that movement. After many difficulties and the refusal of some leading British abstract artists to join (including Victor Pasmore), she was successful in forming a small group of painters, sculptors and architects who held an exhibition in the Royal Festival Hall in 1955 which anticipated many elements of the much better known 1956 Whitechapel Gallery exhibition, 'This is Tomorrow'. In the 1950s she made textile designs for Metz of Amsterdam and Heals of London. In many of her works, Vézelay’s abstract imagery, such as floating quasi-biomorphic shapes, was outside the main characteristics of the constructivist approach. She had a lifelong aim of creating works which were "pleasing and happy” – not terms generally associated with Constructivism. However, her view that ‘pure’ abstract art enhanced the environment, and her involvement with Groupe Espace in the 1950s which promoted the concept of a synthesis (or close collaboration) between architects and abstract painters and sculptors, place her at least in part within the Constructivist tradition.Her post-war textile designs for Heals also place her firmly within the 20th century Modern Movement.
The Tate Gallery gave her a retrospective exhibition in 1983 - a late recognition of the quality of her work and her significant place in art history as one of the first British artists to embark on a lifetime exploration and development of abstraction.

Tybalt Rosembraise

Born on the island of La Désirade in 1798, of a French hebertist father fleeing the repression of the Committee of public Salute, and of a slave mother descended from the Carib Indians. Tybalt Rosembraise was an adventurer who crossed his era as dilettantist : a revolutionary in Argentina, a peasant on the Pampa, a dandy in Paris, a pirate on the Mediterranean Sea, a fisherman in Siberia, a smuggler in China, he led a life free of thought and action to disappear finally in France in 1839. A witness of his time, catalyst of uprisings, he multiplied his encounters and « identities » to the point that today it is difficult to say who this man really was.
Childhood.
The only source which we have concerning Tybalt's youth is the testimony of his friend Jorge Ramos.
His parents not taking interest in his education, Tybalt would have spent his childhood between Les Galets, left the West of the island frequented by smugglers, and Baie-Mahaus in the extreme east, where he would have worked in the leper-house.
South America.
At the age of 14, he understood that he would not inherit any title and it would be labor or employment which would condemn him not to have life choices and to create wealth in exchange for an awful salary. Refusing this fate, he decided to leave for South America on a merchant ship.
Maurice Magre asserts that between 1812 and 1814 Rosembraise lived among natives of Amazonia.
In Buenos Aires, he made friends with Samuel Spiro, lieutenant of the marines, that he would see die on 28 March 1814, while Rosembraise had just been captured by the enemy. A little while later he was won in a game of chance by a rich owner, but he managed to run away and join the Argentina freedom fighters.
In May 1814, the young Rosembraise took part in The combat of Buceo where from which he would emerge wounded in his arm. Then He was taken in by Gaucho of the Argentine pampa, with whom some fought the royalist armies. Introduced as « rastreador » (specialist of the "tracking" of animals and people), he organized numerous sabotages against the Spanish colonizers. In November 1816, he participated in the battle of India Muerta again Portuguese troops. If from a military point of view it was a defeat, Tybalt Rosembraise had a significant meeting with a Portuguese deserter that he followed to Europe.
Europe.
Now, he was 18 years old. Leading his life as he wanted, he did not stay for a long time in Portugal where he made a long-lasting friendship with a librarian of Coimbra, Jorge Ramos whom he would find again later. He helped some Resistance fighters in Spain to fight against the Napoleonic armies, before leaving for Paris.
Of his Parisian journey we know very little, except the story of Dorothea von Biron who might have been his lover. She spoke about a man « "with loose morals but had hard look" » who was successful with a number of women from good families. It would be issues with women which would force him to run away from France in 1819 for the Maghreb.
North Africa and The Middle East.
In some circumstances, Tybalt Rosembraise practised piracy with the Barbaresques. Following his refusal to murder a prisoner, he was rejected and sent to an Ottoman cargo in Syria. He ran away from the army then roamed without water or food in the desert of Syria for several days, and was finally saved by Bedouin people. They presented him to « the queen of Palmyre », Lady Stanhope, with whom he had a relationship until he refused to follow her into the country of the Druze, preferring to leave on the caravan roads connecting the East in Asia.
Asia.
Traveling by foot and horse, he crossed Samarkand, the Kazakh steppes and then the Mongolian steppes as far as lake Baikal, where he had been told as it was he would find one of the most beautiful places of the world. Welcomed warmly by the local people and exhausted by the journey, he would become established in the region as a fisherman, and lead a simple and peaceful life for 3 years.
Afterwards, he investigated the Amur River during the spring and summer of 1827, before he crossed North of Empire Qing (China) the following winter, attending a mystic school close to Taoism, but his desire for the women and his contempt for conforming saw him rejected by the community, and three months in prison.
After these months, he was contacted by the East Indian Trading Company to illegally organize and transport boxes of opium to China via Lingding.
Although he did not deliver any boxes, Tybalt Rosembraise took the money of the English, making a success of a swindle which made him famous among the storekeepers and local sailors, but hated by the English traders and Chinese administration, some wanting to get back the money and others seeing him an uncontrollable opium trafficker. Under the cover of a false identity (he was called « Baudi Grisolia ») he discreetly left Asia on a clipper.
Coming back to Europe.
Although sometimes evoked, Tybalt Rosembraise's exact route from 1830 till 1837 (except places previously quoted) remains to us in fact a complete mystery.
In December 1837, he found his librarian friend Jorge Ramos with whom he studied literature, fine art and philosophy. He told him about some of his adventures which he had noted on several pads (today all missing). Jorge Ramos dedicated one book to him, called "Recordações de Tybalt Rosembraise" (translation: "Tybalt Rosembraise's Memories"); memories of their discussions and his journeys. We learn among other things, of Tybalt Rosembraise's taste for poppies, Italian wines, oriental music and love stories. He loved to describe the life like a long sequence of accidents, mishaps, chance meetings and unexpected moments, and more especially, he thought that life history is discontinuous it is made up of ruptures and limits, breaks and transformations, not always progress. We also discover his personality: discreet but sometimes provocative, seductive but often loving, close to an ideology which we can qualify as anarchist today without ever being partisan, alife never stopped being carried by a constant movement of justice and libertarian revolt.
In 1839, Tybalt Rosembraise decided to come back to Paris to find « an old friend » the name of which he did not clarify (a woman?). He refers simply to his friend « a meeting near the street of Furstenberg ».
Disappearance.
What excited, and still excites the imagination most about the life of Tybalt Rosembraise, is his sudden and total disappearance after his departure for Paris in 1839, while he was only 34 years old. Did he finally arrive in Paris? Did he « line up », find honest employment, and end his wandering? Did he sink into poverty or was he murdered along the way? How long did he live? Months? Or long years?
All these questions remain unresolved, because after 1839 we lose any of Tybalt Rosembraise's track.

Palazzo Ravaschieri Fieschi della Torre

Palazzo Ravaschieri Fieschi della Torre or Palazzo Ravaschieri Fieschi-del Giudice is a 16th-century noble palace in the historical center of Belmonte Calabro in the province of Cosenza, Calabria, southern Italy.
Constructed between 1639 and 1640 on the instructions of Don Orazio Giovan Battista Ravaschieri Fieschi, 1st Prince of Belmonte, after the devastating earthquake of 1638, the palazzo has panoramic views over the Tyrrhenian Sea and of the coastal plain of Marina di Belmonte. It was the official residence of the Ravaschieri Fieschi family, Princes of Belmonte during their sojourns in Belmonte. The palace was built to assist in the defence of the Tyrrhenian seacoast from Saracen invasion. The palace was acquired in 1798 by the del Giudice family, and during the Siege of Belmonte (1806), Tommaso del Giudice was killed by the Jacobins and his pregnant consort was hung from the windowsill of the palace by the mob. The window was thereafter blocked up, and remained so until the 1970s.
The palace takes the form of an “open U” giving onto a courtyard in which the prince's armoury and stables were located. Below the palace, along perimeter walls, there is a garden, from which runs an underground secret passage from the palace to the Palace of Rivellino at Marina di Belmonte.

Niwiska, Podkarpackie Voivodeship

Niwiska is a village and the seat of the rural gmina (administrative district) of Gmina Niwiska (Niwiska Commune) in Kolbuszowa County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It lies approximately west of Kolbuszowa and north-west of the regional capital Rzeszów.
Beginnings of the village.
The village was founded in 1575 by Stanisław Tarnowski. In 1593 Zofia Tarnowska of Mielec founded the first church in Niwiska in thanks for her conversion from arianism. It burned down in 1876. On its ashes a stone and masonry church was built (1880). The first school in Niwiska existed in 1602, and a hospital (for the poor) in 1728. Until 1912 many people were employed at the Niwiska Glass Works.
World War II.
During the German occupation residents of Niwiska and surrounding areas were evicted from their homes. Most of the village's buildings were destroyed. Germans evacuated Niwiska and the neighbouring village of Blizna in order to test their experimental V-1 and V-2 missiles there. The seclusion of the area made it a perfect place for such tests. Throughout the war the same seclusion led refugees and partisans to the Niwiska Forest for a place to hide and conduct subversive activities. Fr. Jan Kurek, a chaplain for the local Home Army ("Armia Krajowa") together with forester Henryk Augustynowicz, played an instrumental role in the decoding of information found on bits of shrapnel and rockets, which assisted the Allies.
After August 3, 1944 the Red Army established there a military hospital and a Soviet airstrip.
Present day.
Today, Niwiska has two schools, a civic center, a health clinic, a fire station and a post office. The village covers an area of , and as of 2009 its total population is 1,560.

Aaron Bolot

Aaron M. Bolot (1900–1989) was a Crimean architect. An emigrant to Australia, Bolot contributed to and designed a number of historically significant buildings, including the Flats at Potts Point, registered with the Register of the National Estate for, among other things, its significance in the history of high rise design in Australia.
Background.
Bolot left Crimea with his family in 1911 to resettle in Australia. In 1926, he graduated from Brisbane's Central Technical College, where he studied architecture, with a Queenslands Institute of Architects Gold Medal. Following graduation, Bolot contributed to several significant projects, including with Walter Burley Griffin, before undertaking solo designs in the 1930s. His notable designs from that period include the Ritz Theatre in Goulburn, New South Wales, the Astra Theatre at Wyong, the Randwick Ritz and the Art Deco Regal Theatre in Gosford. He also redesigned the Melba Theatre in Melbourne, which was renamed the Liberty. In 1941, Bolot entered service under Australia in World War II. Notable designs after the war include an apartment building at 17 Wylde Street in Potts Point, which was completed in 1951. The building was registered in 1997 with the Register of the National Estate as historically significant for several points, including architectural, as "an outstanding example of an International style post war residential building. It holds an important place in the development of a high rise aesthetic in Australia and is valued by the architectural and broader community."

Vane was the son of William Vane, 1st Duke of Cleveland and his first wife, Katherine, the second daughter and coheiress of Harry Powlett, 6th Duke of Bolton. He was Member of Parliament for Winchelsea from 1812 to 1815, for County Durham from 1815 to 1831, for St Ives from 1846 to 1852, and for Ludlow from 1852 to 1857.

After inheriting the estate of his maternal grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton in 1809, he changed his surname to Powlett, under the terms of her will, by Royal Licence in 1813. On inheriting the dukedom of Cleveland from his childless brother Henry in 1864, he resumed the surname of Vane. Also dying childless a few months later, his titles passed to his younger brother, Harry, who took the name of Powlett shortly after. Late in life, he lived at Harewood House, at Cheapside, in Berkshire.

António Sérgio

António Sérgio de Sousa (September 3, 1883 – February 12, 1969) was an influential educationist, philosopher, journalist, sociologist and essayist from Portugal.
Background.
He was the only son and representative of António Sérgio de Sousa (October 22, 1842 – Lisbon, August 18, 1906) - only son and representative of the 98th Governor-General of Portuguese India, 64th Governor of Angola, 59th Governor of Macau and 1st Viscount of Sérgio de Sousa -, and second wife (m. India, Bombay, Church of Our Lady of the Glory of Mazagão, October 22, 1879) Ana Maria Henriques de Brito (Pondá, Novas Conquistas, July 23, 1855 – Lisbon, January 23, 1948).
Sérgio was an important intellectual, thinker and Portuguese politician. Born in Damão, he was influenced by the contact with different cultures. He lived many years in Africa, becoming a cosmopolitan character because, following a family tradition, he studied at the Military College, completing the course of the Navy of War, following which he travelled to Cape Verde and Macao. He left the Navy with the establishment of the Republic in 1910. Sérgio did not consider the issue republic/monarchy important. Important would be the economic progress and welfare of Portugal. He spoke about "socialism", although this was not near the "Marxist socialism". Sérgio was located in a social democratic political line, admiring England, a position similar to the one adopted by the countries of Scandinavia and their Social-Democratic Parties. Sérgio died in Lisbon.
Culture.
He met important Portuguese men of culture such as Fernando Pessoa, Teixeira de Pascoaes, Azeredo Perdigão, or the Doctor Abel Salazar. He was a personal friend of Adolphe Ferrière, Claparède and Paul Langevin - the doctoral advisor of Louis de Broglie (Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929); he was teacher, including at the University of Santiago de Compostela (in 1933) and, by all this, influenced characters as his friend Barahona Fernandes - one of the most distinguished Portuguese psychiatrists - the architect Raul Lino, the Educator Rui Grácio and Mário Soares. One may consider him as an "Educator of Generations". He was Minister of "Public Instruction" for two months and ten days in the government of Alvaro de Castro (1923-12-18 to 1924-02-28).
Political action.
He was a permanent political opponent of the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar, which lasted from 1926 to 1974. He was also linked to the foundation of the Portuguese Socialist Party and to the Humberto Delgado candidacy of the Presidential Elections of 1958. (Humberto Delgado was later murdered by the PIDE, political police of "Salazarism"). Sérgio was arrested in 1910, 1933, 1935, 1948 and 1958. And about this he thought (and wrote) that it was in prison he found the true "national unity" - to oppose the military dictatorship, first, and then Salazar.
He left an enormous work on Education, Epistemology, Culture, History and Politics, especially in his "Essays". Most of the political activity of Sérgio is always compatible with its theoretical aspect - the linking of democracy and freedom as means for Education and Culture. He was also important for his contribution to the introduction of Cooperatives in Portugal.
"The essential principle of democracy is never trust in those who are in the Govern" he wrote. His work influenced lots of important younger Portuguese, men of Culture, Science or Politicians.
Family.
He married in Lisbon, São Mamede, at the Chapel of the Nunciature, on June 14, 1910 to Luísa Estefânia Gerschey da Silva (Lisbon, September 4, 1879 – Lisbon, Lapa, February 29, 1960), daughter of Manuel José da Silva (Lisbon, Mártires, August 4, 1854 – July 23, 1932), a natural son of one of the brothers of the 1st Viscount and 1st Count of Ribeiro da Silva and of Italian and English descent, and wife German Maria Estefânia Gerschey (Lisbon, Alcântara, November 30, 1859 – 1959), without issue.

Mary's Meals

Mary's Meals is a registered charity, formerly known as Scottish International Relief (SIR), that sets up school feeding projects in some of the world's poorest communities, where hunger and poverty prevent children from gaining an education. It was founded in 2002 and has grown from its first feeding operation of 200 children in Malawi, to a world-wide campaign, providing free school meals in hundreds of schools and feeding over 820,000 children daily.
History.
SIR charity began in 1992 during the Balkan conflict, when Magnus and Fergus MacFarlane Barrow organised a local appeal for blankets and food. They filled a Jeep with aid and delivered their cargo to Medjugorje in Bosnia. The brothers, aged 25 and 27, returned to Scotland expecting to resume work as fish farmers, but in their absence their parents’ shed had been filled with more donations.
Magnus took a ‘gap year’, to deliver the aid for as long as it was needed, and has never gone back to his old job. The donations didn’t stop – they still haven’t – so the project was registered as a charity, then named as Scottish International Relief.
In 2002, the Mary's Meals school feeding projects were born in a small cluster of primary schools in Chipini, Chilomoni and various under six centres in Blantyre, Malawi, funded and administered by Scottish International Relief. The idea for Mary's Meals came from UK businessman Tony Smith.
Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, founder and CEO of Mary's Meals, visited Chipini with Gay Russell, a woman from Malawi who was a key figure in famine relief, and Tony Smith, to help organise the first school feeding project there. 
From May 1, 2012, the charity officially changed its name from Scottish International Relief (SIR) to Mary's Meals, to reflect the fact that school feeding, which began as only one element of the organisation's work in 2002, has now become its main focus.
Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow.
Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, OBE was born on 7 February 1968. He attended Oban High School as he was growing up and studied history at university before becoming a salmon farmer. He played shinty for both Scotland and Glenorchy Camanachd.[http://www.skyecamanachd.com/default.aspx.locid-087new2ev.Lang-EN.htm]
He was born into a Catholic family and brought up in Dalmally Argyll, Scotland. His parents' hotel ran as a Highland hunting lodge during the season and much of Magnus' childhood was spent walking across the Highlands, Deer Stalking, and Salmon Fishing. In 1983 a visit to Medjugorje reawakened the MacFarlane-Barrow family's Catholic faith and Magnus' parents felt God was calling them to convert their hotel into a Family House of Prayer. To this day people from many parts of the world come to stay in Craig Lodge Community. It was and still is from Craig Lodge that Magnus directs Mary's Meals. Magnus lives in Argyll, is married, and has 7 children. As founder and CEO of Mary's Meals his vision and ideas continue to inspire and direct the work they do.
Magnus's work has been recognised by several prestigious awards including:
Projects.
Other than the Mary's Meals Campaign the charity carries out several other high profile projects, most notably the Backpack Appeal.
Mary's Meals Campaign.
On a visit to Malawi in 2002, Magnus met a boy whose plight led to a new focus and the charity's main area of work today. Lying on the floor of her hut, the boy's mother was dying of AIDS, surrounded by her six children. 
Magnus asked the oldest son what he hoped for in life, and he said: "to have enough to eat and to go to school one day." The request struck a chord, and led to the evolution of SIR into Mary's Meals at it exists today.
The Mary's Meals Campaign, which is the primary project - and namesake - of the charity is an international movement to set up school feeding projects in communities where poverty and hunger prevent children from gaining an education. Mary's Meals provides daily meals in school for over 650,000 children in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Eastern Europe. 
Mary's Meals currently provides daily meals in 16 countries including Malawi, Liberia, Kenya, India and Haiti.
The Mary's Meals Campaign is hugely successful and there has been a recordable increase in school attendance and in average grades in all the schools that the project starts working in.
Malawi.
Mary's Meals Malawi is by far the biggest projects that Mary's Meals carries out. It reaches over 500,000 children in the country. It also has the lowest running costs of just £7.00 for Mary's Meals to feed a school child in Malawi for a year. This is due to good links with local farmers and the "army" of volunteers that make Mary's Meals happen in Malawi. This immense logistical operation with many volunteer mothers sacrificing their time and giving freely to Mary's Meals was instituted and managed by Peter Nkata for the first six years of Mary's Meals.
Mary's Meals tries to work closely with local communities when establishing a school feeding project. Everyone - chiefs, teachers, parents, church leaders - are involved in the process. Usually land is donated in order to build a kitchen adjacent to the school. Teachers and parents organise a pool of volunteers who will take their turn cooking and serving the meals. 
Mary's Meals provides the kitchen, cooking equipment, training, ongoing support and of course, regular supplies of nutritious Likuni Phala. Each project is visited regularly by Mary's Meals staff to support the volunteers and to ensure all is going as it should. They also collect data from the school to monitor the impact school feeding is having on the pupils.
Backpack Appeal.
One of Mary's Meals' most high profile projects is the Backpack Project, which encourages school children to donate their old school backpacks and fill them with school materials such as notebooks, pencils, flip-flops and T-shirts, to send to children in countries such as Liberia, Uganda and Malawi. The backpack project was the subject of recent TV coverage through Five's Britain's Kindest Kids competition, and an STV feature on Holyrood Secondary School pupils' visit to Malawi.
Emergency Aid.
Today, the main focus of Mary's Meals is its school feeding programmes, but it also has a history of providing emergency relief to many countries, such as Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
Somalia.
During the 2011 East Africa drought, Mary's Meals launched a public appeal for funds to help people suffering as a result of the famine in Somalia which, at its height, was estimated by the UN to be claiming the lives of 250 children every day. Joining forces with South African charity Gift of the Givers, Mary's Meals has sent hundreds of tonnes of likuni phala - the same nutritional maize-based porridge that it feeds to children at Mary's Meals school feeding projects in Malawi - to the Somali capital Mogadishu. As of April 2012, food from Mary's Meals - cooked and served in feeding camps by Gift of the Givers - has amounted to 6.8 million meals.
Haiti.
On January 12, 2010 a magnitude 7 earthquake struck Haiti at around 5pm local time. The quake killed an estimated 200,000 people, left thousands more homeless and devastated the capital Port-au-Prince. Haiti was already the poorest nation in the Americas before this disaster which was why Mary's Meals was working there. Mary's Meals partners in Port-au-Prince were in the midst of the disaster and sadly members of their team were killed and their office buildings destroyed. In nearby Cité Soleil the 8 schools served by Mary's Meals were badly damaged. Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow visited Haiti a few days later and once more in July 2010. He reported progress in the massive rebuilding projects underway but expressed that with the amount of money being donated not enough was being done by the charities working in Haiti.
Burma.
Cyclone Nargis left thousands dead and thousands more homeless with their livelihoods ruined. Mary's Meals already had partners in Burma and their long experience of working in the particularly difficult conditions within Burma meant they were able to gain access to areas badly affected by the floods.
As a result Mary's Meals were able to run several relief and rehabilitation projects. Among them are: the provision of food, clean water and clothing, the rebuilding of 3 schools destroyed by the storms and an orphanage that will provide care for abandoned children.
Bangladesh.
In November 2007 a cyclone caused waves 10 to 15 feet in height that swept away the fragile houses of the poor in Borguna, Bangladesh. Relief materials were distributed. The community appealed to Mary's Meals for assistance and soon they were providing help to rebuild a collapsed secondary school in Borguna. The reconstructed building was designed to double up as cyclone shelter to protect people from the community from storms in the future.
Other Projects.
Since Mary's Meals took over as SIR's main project and eventually became the charity it has focussed most of its efforts on the two main Mary's Meals projects, The Backpack Appeal and Mary's Meals itself. Yet it still carries on with all the work it did previously under the name of SIR.
Iona House.
Some of SIR's first projects after the Balkan conflict were with the orphans of Eastern Europe - particularly Romania. Here it built and maintained homes for abandoned children many of whom were orphaned by the AIDs epidemic. The first such house was called Iona House - named after the Hebridean Island where one of SIR's support groups was based. The orphans were moved from cots in hospitals which they had never left and taken to the house. When they arrived some of them, as old as 7, were so starved of care that they had never even learned to walk, having never been taken out of their cots. The children are now young adults but the homes continue to provide them with the support they need. Mary's Meals operate two other similar homes in Romania and other children's homes in Colombia and Peru.
Sponsor a School.
The sponsor a school campaign is another successful project carried out by Mary's Meals. The Sponsor a School campaign involves an individual or group meeting the costs of feeding children at any given school or providing the money to build a kitchen onto the side of a school, or both. The campaign runs in Malawi and Liberia although there is no need for kitchens in Liberia so there it is just a case of meeting feeding costs. All those who sponsor a school in any form get a school allocated them, their name on a plaque on the side of the
building and a document giving the school's profile.
Sustainability.
The Mary's Meals campaign has been criticised for relying on handouts and donations and as such being unsustainable. However the charity claims that it does not simply hand out food or rely on grants. It buys locally sourced food - which helps boost local economies - and provides it in a sustainable way with a view of the overall development of the countries it works in. Whole generations of children are receiving an education they would otherwise never have had. This, Mary's Meals claims, is the source of its sustainability; it is creating a whole new skilled and educated young population in developing countries that can only benefit the country's economy and help break the poverty cycle. Mary's Meals say they take the long term view, they have exit strategies and all their projects are aimed at eventual self-sufficiency in the communities they operate in and their projects are designed to engender the self-sufficiency straight away.
Fundraising.
Being a British charity it is still Britain in which Mary's Meals has the largest infrastructure of supporters in place. Support groups meet and hold events in many towns and cities in the UK. Parishes and businesses have adopted the charity in many areas. Mary's Meals also has several charity shops in various UK locations. 
In the last few years Mary's Meals has sought to extend its support beyond the borders of the UK. Mary's Meals now have supporter bases in America, Australia, Austria, Germany, Croatia, Ireland, Italy and Bosnia -Herzegovina. These bases raise money and awareness for the charity in their areas. Some take part in the Backpack appeal and all fundraise for the Mary's Meals campaign and for the emergency aid campaigns.
Growing Awareness.
On 12 August 2010, Mary's Meals Chief Executive Magnus Macfarlane-Barrow was praised as a CNN Hero for his role in founding and running Mary's Meals. A video detailing his work with Mary's Meals was broadcast across the USA and the internet, reaching millions of viewers and further promoting the work of Mary's Meals. St Angelas Primary School in Glasgow,Scotland wrote a song to raise awawareness for the charity and has been a huge success in CD sales and have put together a music video and will be selling DVDs in the near future. The song can be found on iTunes,C.Dbaby and YouTube as well as the schools website, Mary's Meals website and Mary's Meals Facebook page.
NeverSeconds.
In 2011, some primary school children from Argyll started a club called Charity Children and raised £70 for Mary's Meals. One of them, Martha Payne, went on to create a JustGiving page on 1 June 2012 linked to her blog, NeverSeconds, about school meals. Her aim was to raise enough to buy a kitchen for Mary's Meals (£7000), and she put in £50 that a magazine had paid for use of her pictures. After Argyll and Bute Council tried to stop Martha taking pictures of her food, worldwide media coverage brought millions of new visitors to her blog, and contributions of more than £108,000 in less than a month. The kitchen in Blantyre, Malawi which this money will pay for is to be called 'Friends of NeverSeconds' at Martha's request.

Fritz-Julius Lemp

Fritz-Julius Lemp (19 February 1913–9 May 1941) was a "Kapitänleutnant" with the Kriegsmarine during World War II and commander of , and . He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
Career.
"Athenia" incident.
On September 3, 1939, while in command of U-30 he sank the 13,581 ton passenger ship "Athenia", the first ship sunk in World War II. Lemp later claimed that the fact that she was steering a zigzag course which seemed to be well off the normal shipping routes made him believe she was either a troopship or an armed merchant cruiser, and when he realized his error took the first steps to conceal the facts by omitting to make an entry in the submarine's log, and swearing his crew to secrecy. Adolf Hitler decided that the incident should be kept secret for political reasons, and the German newspaper "Völkischer Beobachter" published an article which blamed the loss of the "Athenia" on the British, accusing Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, of sinking the ship to turn neutral opinion against Nazi Germany. The truth did not emerge until January 1946 at the Nuremberg trials, during the case against Grand Admiral Raeder, when a statement by Admiral Dönitz was read in which he admitted that "Athenia" had been torpedoed by "U-30" and that every effort had been made to cover it up.
U-110.
"U-110" was captured on 9 May 1941 in the North Atlantic south of Iceland by the destroyers , HMS "Broadway" and the British corvette . After depth charges forced the boat to the surface, where she was shelled, Lemp ordered the crew to abandon ship and open the vents in order to sink the crippled U-boat.
Lemp was not among the 34 survivors rescued by the Allied vessels, and one account of his fate has him swimming back to the submarine when he realized that the scuttling charges were not going to detonate and either being shot and killed by the boarding party or drowning in the icy water. After the war the Germans claimed that Lemp had been shot in the water, either by sub-lieutenant Balme's boarding party from HMS "Bulldog" or from the "Bulldog". Balme, however, assured German journalists that no shot had been fired at any time by his party. Joe Baker-Cresswell, commander of the "Bulldog", also denied that Lemp had been shot, and the official British explanation remains that Lemp committed suicide by drowning when he realized the consequences of his failure.

Branimir Poljac

Branimir Poljac (born 17 May 1984) is a former Norwegian football striker who was playing for Konyaspor in Turkey before he had a car-accident. He has Croatian parents.
Career.
Poljac started his career in Klemetsrud and KFUM Oslo and then as a junior player he signed for Stabæk. He played for Stabæk in the Norwegian Tippeliga, but limited playing time saw him moving to Moss ahead of the 2008 season. In January 2009, Poljac signed with the Turkish club Konyaspor.
On 2 April 2010, Poljac was seriously injured in a car accident. Poljac lost control of his car in a curve, and went off the road, landing on its roof. According to news reports, Poljac suffered serious neck injuries in the crash, and might be permananently paralyzed.
His accident has shocked Turkey, since the fans and the city liked him, and saw him as great gentleman and a good player, with potential. Many fan groups, likewise ordinary Turks, are praying for him, since he was popular in the city. On the 6th of April, it was first reported that he was still in a serious condition and could potentially die and that the risk for him, becoming paralyzed was as high as 90%.
Later the same day, doctors said, that he would survive the accident, whereas Branimir Poljac stated: 
"I survived a huge accident. For now I feel lucky I am live. I want to get well as soon as possible and return to football. From the accident until today, I want to thank everyone who has supported me. Everyone who loves me, keep on praying for me."[http://www.konhaber.com/new/haber/2/25398/Guncel/Poljac-Yeniden-oynamak-istiyorum.html]
In order to give him a moral support, a website has been created for his honour, called "Legend Poljac" where people wrote messages to him. 
Now Branimir Poljac is in Norway in Sunnaas Hospital and fighting back after the car accident. He is slowly regaining use of his limbs. At first he could only move his shoulders, but now he is beginning to feel his arms, and his situation has moved very fast forward. In an interview he stated that he will be back somehow, 100% healthy as before the accident.
Konyaspor's involvement with Poljac after the accident.
Konyaspor is constantly in touch with Poljac. The team bus now displays the pictures of Poljac, and the Turkish Football Federation has reimbursed the player with 100,000 Turkish Liras for the accident.

George Pitt, 2nd Baron Rivers

George Pitt, 2nd Baron Rivers (1751–1828) was a British politician.
He was the only son of George Pitt, 1st Baron Rivers and his wife Penelope, daughter of Sir Henry Atkins, 4th baronet of Clapham, Surrey. He succeeded his father as Member of Parliament for Dorset in 1774, retaining the seat until 1790. In 1803, he succeeded his father as Baron Rivers. He was a Lord of the Bedchamber from 1804 to 1819.
He sold part of the family estates, those around Stratfield Saye House to the nation in about 1814, so that it could be given to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. On his death in 1828, one of his baronies (Baron Rivers of Stratfieldsaye) became extinct, but the other passed (like his remaining estates) to his brother-in-law William Beckford, who thereupon took the surname Pitt-Rivers.

Virtway

Virtway is a serious game developer located in Oviedo, Spain. It was founded in 1999 as a general IT consulting firm, but in 2006 it spun off from its parent company to focus on 3D development and serious gaming as an independent branch of the Indigo Group holding.
eLearning platform.
The main focus of the company has been developing an advanced simulation system to empower learning through gaming, called VTS (Virtual Training System). The platform was presented at the 2008 Games+Learning+Society conference in partnership with Robb Lindgren from Stanford University.
VTS is built on top of the Gamebryo game engine and uses NVIDIA PhysX for the physics simulation (Formerly known as Ageia).
Apparently VTS is being applied to several areas of training, such as Firefighting (a teaser video depicting firefighters appeared on the company's YouTube channel) or Iron/Steel Industry.
3D Simulation.
Virtway has an extensive experience in developing 3D simulations/recreations of realistic scenarios distributed by several means (such as web pages). 
"Molina Digital" was the first large scale 3D project developed by Virtway. It was the recreation of a Spanish town (Molina de Segura, Murcia) where users could chat, drive cars and play Pétanque, all in 3D and through an Internet browser, leveraging the Quest3D technology. 
Part of the Molina Digital project was the development of an "Interactive Theatre", a pioneer application where users could take a role in a virtual play. Each user handles an avatar on stage, and controls its body language and facial expression while he talks with his mates. Everything is recorded by another user -the director- who edits the footage later, in a way similar to a machinima production.
Virtway has also been contracted by the regional government of Asturias to develop a 3D virtual visit of the city of Llanes. The result of this contract is a website where users can visit said town in 3D using x3d technology and a port of the landmarks to Google Earth KML models.
Videogames.
Virtway started the development of a project called "Born To Run" in 2004, and presented it in late 2006. It was aimed to be one of the first First Person Shooters with photo-realistic levels of quality made in Spain, and slated to hit "next-gen" systems (PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360). There has been no more information about the game since its announcement, so it is probably cancelled by now.
On 6 October 2008, Virtway entered into partnership with ICYou, a Swedish company, to further develop their so-called Interactive City platform, a persistent virtual world with tie-ins to the real world of its players through a blend of virtual and real economy.
Collaborations.
Strategic Partnerships.
As a member of the Indigo Group Holding, Virtway collaborates with some strategic partners which share their knowledge and allow them to offer better services.
As one of their partners Alletrust offers experience to Virtway improving their process and services.
ICYou AB (Publ) is a strategic partners that develops the Interactive City on the Virtway platform.
Research.
Virtway has maintained collaborations through the Índigo Group with University of Oviedo and Stanford University in different research and development projects.

Charles Jocelyn Hambro

Air Commodore Sir Charles Jocelyn Hambro, (3 October 18971963) was a merchant banker and intelligence officer.
Career.
Hambro was born into a banking family of Danish origin which had settled in Dorset and the City of London in the early 19th century. He was the son of Charles Eric Hambro, a partner in C. J. Hambro & Son (later to become Hambros Bank) and a Conservative Member of Parliament for Wimbledon between 1900 and 1907.
Between 1910 and 1915 Charles was educated at Eton College, joining the cricket team in 1914 and becoming the Captain in 1915. After leaving he immediately went to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, being made an Ensign in the Coldstream Guards in 1916. He was immediately posted to the Western Front, serving for two years until demobilisation and being awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous bravery in action.
After initial training with the Guaranty Trust Company in New York (where he and his wife lived with Harry Morgan) he joined his family bank J.C. Hambro & Sons], playing a large part in its merger with the British Bank of Northern Commerce in 1920, with the combined bank taking the name Hambros Bank in 1921. In 1928, when only 30, Charles was elected a director of the Bank of England, and between 1932 and 1933 he put all work outside the bank to one side to work on establishing the bank's exchange control division under the direction of Montagu C. Norman, the Bank of England director. In 1937 Charles was asked to succeed Norman as director, but he turned it down as he was suffering from oral cancer, although surgical operations and radiation therapy later helped him recover.
At the start of World War II he was asked by Ronald Cross to join the "Ministry of Economic Warfare", a cover organisation for the Special Operations Executive. Hambro was placed in charge of activities in Scandinavia, arranging smuggling and sabotage operations. Through his contact with Ebbe Munck, an anti-Nazi journalist, Charles linked up with the Danish resistance, and was made KBE for his work in 1941. Hambro refused to accept any wages for his military work during wartime.
Between December 1940 and November 1941 Charles was also in charge of overseeing the French, Belgian, German and Dutch sections of the SOE, and from November 1941 he was deputy leader of SOE for 5 months. In 1942 he succeeded in persuading the British and Norwegian organisations to form a planning commission, which was instrumental in the formation of Operation Grouse and Operation Swallow, instrumental parts of the Norwegian heavy water sabotage missions. By this time Charles was on the Executive Committee of the SOE, and was promoted to Air Commodore. Roundell Palmer, now head of the SOE, appointed him to succeed Frank Nelson. His first major action as head of the SOE was to meet with Colonel William Joseph Donovan, the head of the OSS and his opposite number. A disagreement over actions in the Middle East led Charles to resign in 1943.
For the rest of the war he acted as head of the "British raw materials mission" in Washington; a cover for exchanging information and technology between Britain and the United States which led to the detonation of the first Atomic Bomb as part of the Manhattan Project.
Family.
In 1919 Charles married Pamela Cobbold, with whom he had four children:
In 1936 he re-married: his second wife was Dorothy Helen Mackay: her first husband had been Marcus Wallenberg (junior) 1899–1982). They went on to have a daughter, Sally.
A relative, Carl Joachim Hambro, (the younger) was a politician and civil servant in Norway and in exile during World War II in Sweden.

The Meteor Rideau was a full-size automobile from the Canada-only Meteor brand of the Ford Motor Company sold from 1954–61 and 1965-76. It was named for the Rideau River, a river in Southern Ontario, where the car was built. From 1957, the line included both the Rideau series and the higher-trim Rideau 500. The Rideau began as the top-trim level of the Meteor line, but beginning with the 1965 models, it was the lowest trim series.

16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF

The 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF was a unit of the First World War Canadian Expeditionary Force. It was organized at Valcartier on 2 September 1914 in response to the Great War and was composed of recruits from the 91st Canadian Highlanders (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders), the 79th Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, the 72nd Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, and the 50th Regiment (Gordon Highlanders).
The 16th Battalion served in the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division. Since its early beginnings, the battalion had a high standard of conduct on the battlefield and was commanded by outstanding leaders. One such was Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Currie, KCMG, who rose to command the Canadian Corps during the Great War. Currie was a master tactician whose skills led the Canadians to victory at Vimy Ridge and Amiens. Lieutenant-Colonel Cyrus Wesley Peck commanded the battalion for many months in the trenches.
Four members of the 16th Battalion were awarded the Victoria Cross: Piper James Cleland Richardson, Private William Johnstone Milne, Lance-Corporal William Henry Metcalf, and Lieutanant-Colonel Cyrus Peck. Piper James Richardson was just 18 years old when he enlisted, and was killed during the Battle of the Somme shortly after having played his company through No Man's Land. He disappeared in shellfire after going back to retrieve the bagpipes he laid aside to bring back a wounded comrade.
The battalion returned to England on 27 March 1919, disembarked in Canada on 4 May 1919, was demobilized on 8 May 1919, and was disbanded by General Order 149 of 15 September 1920.
The 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF is perpetuated by The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary's).

Stephanie Slater

Stephanie Slater (born on 7 February 1991) is a British Paralympic swimmer competing in S8 classification events. Slater began her sporting career as an able bodied athlete, but after suffering nerve damage to her left arm she switched to Parasport. In 2013 she qualified for the Swimming World Championships in Montreal.
Early career.
Slater was born in 1991 in Preston, England and began swimming from the age of three. A talented swimmer as a youth, Slater challenged as an able bodied athlete and began entering British Championships from 2006. Specialising in the breaststroke, she continually improved during the British Championships, finishing 4th in the 100m breaststroke final in 2009. In the 2010 Championship, she took silver in the 50m breaststroke and was seen as a prospect for the British team at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, and a future Olympic athlete.
While training at Team GB’s Intensive Training Centre in Swansea, she experienced severe weakness and intense pain to her left arm while swimming. The injury did not clear and she was forced to pull out from her goal of making the Commonwealth Games. After 2 years of several tests and scans, it was diagnosed that Slater had suffered nerve damage to her brachial plexus which ended her career as an able-bodied athlete. Slater also suffers from a degenerative eye condition affecting both eyes. She also has a leg length discrepancy.
World Championships.
Slater returned home to Preston to her family after her condition had been diagnosed, and having been a Gamesmaker at the London 2012 Paralympics in the Aquatics Centre,this inspired her to return to the pool as a Para-Swimmer. In December 2012 she began entering events as a Para- Swimmer. She entered the British International Disability Swimming Championships in Sheffield in April 2013. There she set a British and European record when she recorded a time of 1:11.03 in the 100m Butterfly S8.

French World Scrabble Championships

The French World Scrabble Championships () is an annual Scrabble tournament that takes place in a different French-speaking country every year. Created in 1972 by Hippolyte Wouters, it was the first of the three World Scrabble Championships to be created, with the English version being created in 1991 and the Spanish version being created in 1997.
Unlike the English and Spanish versions, the French World Championships are made up of various tournaments, somewhat like the World Series of Poker. The "Main Event" is the Elite tournament which has existed since 1972, and was first won by the tournament's creator Hippolyte Wouters.
List of tournaments.
Other tournaments.
Some other tournaments are organised during the week which do not crown a World Champion but do have a winner:
History of the Championships.
The French World Scrabble Championships started off as a small tournament in Cannes with just 7 players, and at the time, was not considered to be a World Championship. The tournament moved each year and more and more players which led to other tournaments being created at the same venue. The Elite tournament was at first dominated by Belgian players, with 5 of the first 7 championships being won by Belgian players. After three French winners in 1979, 80 and 81 the tournament was taken over by Michel Duguet of France who won the tournament 5 times in 7 years, while finishing second twice in that period. Duguet also set various championship records by dropping just 12 points in 5 games, which is 99.71%. After winning the Elite World Championship for a 5th time he retired from Scrabble and took up contract bridge and became one of the best players in the world, competing in both the French national championships and the European team championships.
After Duguet's retirement the French domination of the championships continued, with in total 12 championships in a row being won by France. Indeed France also took second place every year during that ran, apart from in 1990 when Christian Pierre of Belgium finished second. In 1991 it was Christian Pierre who won Belgium's first title since 1978 and continued to win the title a total of 5 times in 8 years, matching what Duguet did in the 1980s. In 2002 and 2003 Jean Pierre Hellebaut became the first Swiss winner of the tournament. In fact he was born in Belgium and had previously finished second in the Belgian national championship in 1991 but after moving to Switzerland, won the World Championship 2 years in a row, a feat only accomplished before that by Duguet and Pierre. Antonin Michel has since dominated the Elite World Championships, having won the tournament twice in 2005 and 2007 and having finished second in 2001 and 2006.
The pairs event has been mainly dominated by France; Michel Duguet holds the record with five titles while Antonin Michel and Franck Maniquant (also of France) are just behind with 4 titles. Two African players have won the title - Ndongo Samba Sylla and Mactar Sylla of Senegal - these two are in fact brothers.
The blitz is a relatively recent event, added in 2001 and 5 of the 8 championships have been won by Antonin Michel. The four other winners and Florian Lévy and Franck Maniquant of France, and Ndongo Samba Sylla and Mactar Sylla of Senegal.
The match play tournament known as "le Championnat du monde de Scrabble classique" was brought in in 2006 and has been systematically dominated by African players, showing that the traditional form of Scrabble is more popular in Africa than the duplicate one. In 2008 in Dakar, 7 of the top 10 players were African, the three exceptions being Pascal Astresses, Antonin Michel and Hervé Bohbot all from France.

People Move On

People Move On is the debut album from English singer Bernard Butler released in 1998.
Background.
Following his split from soul singer David McAlmont in 1995 and a three-year absence from the public eye, Butler re-emerged on Alan McGee's Creation label for his debut solo album. A year earlier McGee had, in fact, dubbed him the "Neil Young of the Nineties". Butler wrote all the songs, produced the album and played all the instruments, except drums and strings, which were played by Makoto Sakamoto and The Brilliant Strings respectively. According to Butler, most of the ideas on the album were created in the studio, with only four songs written beforehand.
Drawing influences from classic rock from the late 60s and 70s, "The Independent" wrote: ""People Move On" echoes the early Seventies cool rock singer/songwriting era in its heartfelt sentiment and warm, melodic approach." Though Butler has stressed that it isn't a "retro record". The record has a Spector-esque feel, which according to "Rolling Stone" displays an "old-fashioned big-pop-production quality of the songs."
Reception.
The album was released to generally positive reviews, though some critics felt that Butler's vocals were rather thin. One reviewer felt that "his voice doesn't carry enough weight to give the songs a killer instinct." In response to the criticism Butler stated: "I'm not claiming I'm a technically talented singer, and I'm certainly not some kind of tortured poet who sits with a notebook under trees pondering the meaning of life, but my voice allowed me to express a part of me I had found very difficult to express in conversation before."
Simon Evans of the "Birmingham Post" highly praised the album. He felt that, "Butler has at last delivered the kind of high-grade solo album he always seemed capable of when he finally gave up the celebrity sessioning." He then compared the album to the last output by his creation labelmates Oasis, saying: "this is the kind of tuneful, fun, album Oasis should have made after "Morning Glory", until their ambitions expanded exponentially with their egos."
Andy Gill of "The Independent" alluded to the album's classic rock influences and aside from " the occasional ponderous moment," he felt that "overall, it is a notable, and welcome, success." He went on to say: " Butler's sheer ambition hoists most tracks to their optimum level, allowing him for the first time to be defined by his future rather than his past."
Chart performance and sales.
Singles released from the album were "Stay", "Not Alone" and "A Change of Heart". The album peaked at No. 11 on the UK Albums Chart. "Stay" was the highest charting single, peaking at #12. The album was certified gold in the UK selling over 100,000 copies. Following the album's success, Butler was nominated for a BRIT award as best new male artist in 1999.

Terter dynasty

Terter (), also Terterids or Terterovtsi (Тертеровци), was a Bulgarian noble and royal house that ruled the Second Bulgarian Empire between 1280 and 1292, as well as between 1300 and 1323.
The Terterids were originally of Cuman origin (i.e. from the western branch of the Turkic Kipchaks), according to Plamen Pavlov they were a branch of the Cuman noble dynasty of Terteroba who had settled in Bulgaria as part of the second wave of Cuman migration, coming from the Kingdom of Hungary after 1241. The Terteroba clan had ruled the steppe proto-state of Cumania in the late 11th century, as well as in the mid-13th century under Köten.
The earliest representatives of the dynasty in Bulgaria were the "despotēs" Aldimir (Eltimir) and his older brother George Terter who was crowned emperor of Bulgaria as George I of Bulgaria (1280-1292), marrying the Bulgarian Maria. After his reign, Bulgaria was under the "de facto" control of the Golden Horde, with Nogai Khan nominating the next ruler, Smilets (1292-1298), who was of another noble family, and was briefly succeeded by his son Ivan II (1298-1299). In 1299-1300, Bulgaria was controlled by the Mongol Chaka. Chaka was deposed by George Terter's son, Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria (1300-1321), beginning the second reign of the Terterids, which also spanned that of his son, George II of Bulgaria.
The Terter dynasty was succeeded by the Shishman noble dynasty of Vidin, also of partial Cuman origin.

Arielle Martin

Arielle Martin (aka Arielle Verhaaren) (born July 30, 1985 of Cedar Hills, Utah) is a US BMX cyclist.
She crashed in the quarter-finals at the World Championships held in Taiyuan, China, on June 2, 2008, with the result that Jill Kintner, her friend and roommate at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California, finished in sixth place, which was enough to guarantee Jill the only automatic women's spot on the US BMX Olympic Team. USA Cycling has a 17-race points series, and Jill had 129 points to Martin's 128. Kintner made up and went beyond a 13-point deficit with her sixth place and Martin's crash, became the one US Women's representative in the BMX racing event, and received a bronze medal, a medal she says was half won by Martin, who, after crashing, returned to the training center to help Kintner train. The two say that living together in the training center just made them able to push each other, as they remained neck and neck until Martin's accident. They had worked so hard together that Kintner characterized her win as bittersweet, at first more bitter than sweet.
Martin finished a degree in exercise science in 2007 at Brigham Young University. She was married in December 2007 to Michael Verhaaren and has taken his name except for when she is involved in bike competitions. They left their Utah home on separate missions, she to train for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, and he to spend a year deployed in Afghanistan with the US Army.
Martin's father was a BMX racer. As a young girl, she watched him, then started riding a BMX bike at the age of two. At 15 she turned pro and in October 2007, became the third woman in the world to do a backflip on a BMX bike. Martin has said that missing the Beijing Olympics made her more determined than ever to remain at the top in BMX and to compete at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Martin was selected to compete at the London 2012 Olympics but a crash during a training run on July 30 in California, hospitalized her and left her out of the team, being replaced by Brooke Crain
Martin is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
