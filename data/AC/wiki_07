Political positions of John McCain

U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ), a member of the U.S. Congress since 1983, a two-time U.S. presidential candidate, and the nominee of the Republican Party in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, has taken positions on many political issues through his public comments, his presidential campaign statements, and his senatorial voting record.
Online, McCain uses his Senate web site and his 2008 campaign web site to describe his political positions.
Regarding the general notion of consistency of political positions over time, McCain said in June 2008: "My principles and my practice and my voting record are very clear. Not only from 2000 but 1998 and 1992 and 1986. And you know, it's kind of a favorite tactical ploy now that opponents use, of saying the person has changed. Look, none of my principles or values have changed. Have I changed position on some specific issues because of changed circumstances? I would hope so! I would hope so!" It is often reported that McCain has grown more conservative throughout his tenure in the Senate, according to various studies.
Economic policy.
McCain's 2006 rating by the Almanac of American Politics (2008) on Economic Policy is 64% conservative, 35% liberal (52% conservative, 47% liberal in 2005). McCain fleshed out the main points of his economic plan in an April 15, 2008 speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania. In summary, McCain would make the Bush tax cuts permanent instead of letting them expire, he would eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax in order to assist the middle-class, he would double the personal exemption for dependents, reduce the corporate tax rate, and offer a new research and development tax credit. At the same time, he pledges to eliminate pork-barrel spending, freeze nondefense discretionary spending for a year or more, and reduce Medicare growth. He is also opposed to extravagant salaries and severance deals of corporate CEOs.
Budget, taxes, and deficits.
While McCain has historically opposed tax cuts in favor of deficit reduction, he now favors tax cuts. He says that he would reduce government spending to make up for the tax cuts.
McCain had declined to sign the pledge of the group Americans for Tax Reform to not add any new taxes or increase existing taxes. However, after he lost the presidential election in 2008, McCain became a signer of Americans for Tax Reform’s Taxpayer Protection Pledge. In 2002, Sen. McCain was one of only two Republicans to twice vote against the permanent repeal of the Estate Tax, and has recently stated opposition to a permanent repeal of the Estate Tax. McCain was one of two Republicans who voted against Bush's tax cuts in 2001. He opposed accelerating the cuts in 2003, saying that he was not in favor of cutting taxes during a time of war. In 2004 McCain appeared on "Meet The Press" with Tim Russert where he was asked about his opposition to the Bush tax cuts. McCain explained himself by saying, "I voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportional amount that went to the wealthiest Americans. I would clearly support not extending those tax cuts in order to help address the deficit." However, McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006, and January 2008 he told Russert that he favors making those tax cuts permanent to prevent an increase in taxes while the economy was "shaky." He also said that his tax proposal would focus more on middle-income Americans than on the wealthy.
McCain has stated that he believes in keeping marginal tax rates low, but that lower taxes work best "when accompanied by lower spending." 
In January 2008, McCain said "“People talk about a stimulus package. Fine, if that's what we want to come up with. But stop the spending first.”
In a major economic speech on April 15, 2008, McCain proposed a number of tax reductions and backed away from his pledge to balance the budget by the end of his first term, saying it would take him eight years. His speech focused on cuts to corporate tax rates and the extension of the Bush tax cuts, and also called for eliminating the alternative-minimum tax and doubling the value of exemptions for dependents to $7,000. This is in contrast to McCain's historical emphasis on deficit reduction over tax cuts. McCain's proposal for decreasing the federal budget deficit includes reforming the "self-serving largesse that defines the current budget process." In the speech, McCain said that the savings from eliminating earmarks, reviewing federal programs and other budget reforms would be “on the order of $100 billion annually.”
On July 8, 2008, in an interview, McCain said that "historically when you raise people's taxes, revenue goes down. Every time we cut capital gains taxes, there has been an increase in revenues."
Defense spending.
McCain supports ending the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, the Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser, and the Boeing and Science Applications International Corporation Future Combat Systems.
McCain called the F-35 program a "scandal and a tragedy", but when an Arizonan airbase was chosen for the aircraft he lauded it as "the greatest combat aircraft in the history of the world".
Pork barrel spending (earmarks).
McCain has been called one of the Senate's most outspoken critics of pork barrel spending. 
On April 16, 2007, McCain gave a speech on the U.S. economy to the Economic Club of Memphis. He criticized wasteful spending and reiterated his promise to make any sponsors of pork or earmarks "famous" when he becomes president.
In March 2008, Gannett News Service reported that McCain's home state of Arizona ranked last in federal earmarks, because three of the state's ten lawmakers in Washington – McCain and House Republicans Jeff Flake and John Shadegg – refuse to ask for any federal money for local projects. In March 2008, he was one of twenty-nine U.S. Senators, including Obama and Clinton, to vote in favor of a one-year moratorium on earmarks.
McCain says he hopes to stop special interests from lobbying for special projects. His 2008 campaign website includes the statement that "The federal government spends too much money, squanders precious resources on questionable projects pushed by special interests, and ignores the priorities of the American taxpayer." Earmarks total about $18 billion a year, according to independent estimates. However, on August 2, 2007, he voted against a bi-partisan bill to provide greater transparency in the legislative process and to regulate lobbyists.
Free trade.
McCain is a strong proponent of free trade. He supports the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the existing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) agreements, U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization, and opposes renegotiation of trade agreements, saying, "...the U.S. should engage in multilateral, regional and bilateral efforts to reduce barriers to trade, level the global playing field and build effective enforcement of global trading rules." In 2004, when McCain was asked, "Should trade agreements include provisions to address environmental concerns and to protect workers' rights?", he answered, "No."
Regarding protectionism, in 2007 McCain said, "I'm a student of history. Every time the United States has become protectionist ... we've paid a very heavy price. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Acts in the 1930s were direct contributors to World War II. It sounds like a lot of fun to bash China and others, but free trade has been the engine of our economy. Free trade should be the continuing principle that guides this nation's economy."
Social Security and Medicare.
In June 1999, McCain said "The only way to increase the yield on Social Security dollars is by allowing workers to make investment decisions for themselves; by empowering American families to invest, in most robust portfolios, a portion of their earnings for Social Security that they would otherwise pay in taxes to Social Security." In January 2000, he repeated his strong support for creating partially private Social Security accounts. In 2004, he said, "Without privatization, I don't see how you can possibly, over time, make sure that young Americans are able to receive Social Security benefits."
In April 2008, McCain proposed that seniors with higher incomes should pay higher premiums for government-provided prescription drug benefits (Medicare Part D) as a way to reduce federal spending on health care. 
As of May 2008, McCain's web site says:
John McCain will fight to save the future of Social Security and believes that we may meet our obligations to the retirees of today and the future without raising taxes. John McCain supports supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts – but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept.
On June 12, 2008, McCain fielded a question in a town hall meeting, saying, "But I'm not for quote privatizing Social Security, I never have been, I never will be."
On July 7, 2008, McCain criticized the traditional pay-as-you-go financing of Social Security, saying: "Americans have got to understand that we are paying present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today. And that's a disgrace." The next day, he reiterated that Social Security uses current workers' tax payments to fund current retirees' benefits, and he said, "That’s why it’s broken, that’s why we can fix it."
McCain has not offered a specific plan to address the possible Social Security shortfall, but has stated that although he prefers not to raise taxes, all options, including payroll tax increases, are "on the table".
Subprime mortgage crisis.
Regarding the subprime mortgage crisis, McCain said its root cause was loose credit and greed. On January 31, 2008, he said, "I think there are some greedy people on Wall Street that perhaps need to be punished." He also praised the George W. Bush administration's handling of the crisis. McCain later addressed the situation in a speech:
I will not play election year politics with the housing crisis. I will evaluate everything in terms of whether it might be harmful or helpful to our effort to deal with the crisis we face now. 
I have always been committed to the principle that it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly, whether they are big banks or small borrowers. Government assistance to the banking system should be based solely on preventing systemic risk that would endanger the entire financial system and the economy.
McCain went on to say he would entertain the thought to only give temporary assistance to homeowners for their primary homes, but not to others who owned homes to rent out nor to speculators. He also proposed that mortgage lenders do more to help the economy by helping their customers. He suggested an approach that General Motors did after the September 11 attacks when they reduced interest rates for their customers. "We need a similar response by the mortgage lenders. They've been asking the government to help them out. I'm now calling upon them to help their customers, and their nation out. It's time to help American families."
McCain's speech on the Senate floor during debate of Federal Housing Regulatory Act Of 2005:
“OFHEO’s report solidifies my view that the GSEs need to be reformed without delay. I join as a cosponsor of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, S. 190, to underscore my support for quick passage of GSE regulatory reform legislation. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole.”
S.190 was a bill to address the regulation of secondary mortgage market enterprises, and for other purposes. introduced January 2005 McCain was a co-sponsor.
As of mid-September 2008, McCain had not introduced any banking or housing bills in the 110th Congress, which began in January 2007.
In October 2008, McCain proposed that the federal government buy troubled mortgages, and provide low-interest mortgages to qualified homeowners. For people with 401(k) plans, he wanted to allow more flexibility about when money can be withdrawn, and would lower the tax on that money, as well as lowering the tax on unemployment insurance benefits. McCain also proposed to cut the capital gains tax on stock held for more than one year, while increasing the tax write-off for stock losses.
Financial deregulation.
In 1999, McCain voted for the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which passed in the Senate by a vote of 54–44. The deregulation bill loosened restrictions on the activities of banks, brokerage houses, and insurance companies. In 2002 he voted for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which passed the Senate without opposition. In 2007, however, McCain stated that he regretted his vote in favor of Sarbanes-Oxley, which strengthened financial reporting requirements for publicly held companies but which has been the subject of complaints from businesses.
In 2008, McCain expressed approval of the results of financial deregulation by pointing to it as a model for health care policy, writing: "Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation."
Later in 2008, in the wake of the widely publicized crises involving the insurance company American International Group and the brokerage houses Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, McCain stated: "In my administration, we're going to hold people on Wall Street responsible. And we're going to enact and enforce reforms to make sure that these outrages never happen in the first place." 
In 2009, McCain temporarily expressed support for reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act that he had voted to repeal in order to respond to banking regulation failures in the Financial Crisis, though he also ultimately voted against the Obama Administration-backed Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
Health care.
McCain is against publicly funded health care, universal health care, or health coverage mandates. Instead, he favors tax credits of up to $5,000 for families to get health insurance. His plan focuses on enhancing competition in the health care industry as a way to lower costs. To that end, McCain favors the Health Care Choice Act, which would allow citizens to purchase health insurance nationwide instead of limiting them to in-state companies, and to buy insurance through any organization or association they choose as well as through their employers or buying direct from an insurance company. In an October 2007 statement, McCain said: "In health care, we believe in enhancing the freedom of individuals to receive necessary and desired care. We do not believe in coercion and the use of state power to mandate care, coverage or costs."
On April 29, 2008, McCain detailed his health care plan in the context of his campaign for President. His plan focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. At the heart of his plan are tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer. He says the money could be used to purchase insurance and force insurance companies to be competitive with their costs in order to attract consumers. To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain would work with states to create what he calls a "Guaranteed Access Plan". He did not provide details, but pointed to states such as Florida and North Carolina where such systems are in place. His health care plan has an estimated annual cost of $7 billion, according to McCain's health-policy experts. On April 30, his campaign acknowledged that the health plan he had outlined would have the effect of increasing tax payments for some workers, primarily those with high incomes and expensive health plans.
McCain would pay for individual tax credits primarily by eliminating the tax break currently offered to employers for providing health insurance to employees. On October 5, 2008, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain's senior policy adviser, said the tax credits would also be funded in part from eliminating Medicare (United States) fraud and by changing Medicare and Medicaid payment policies to lower the overall cost of medical care.
Technology.
On August 14, 2008, McCain released a policy paper titled "John McCain and American Innovation" that proposed a ten-percent tax credit for wages paid employees doing research and development. The plan reiterated McCain's positions against Internet taxes and against laws guaranteeing net neutrality.
"Crypto" notes that Senator McCain and Senator Kerrey introduced a bill in mid-1997 that would have refused the services of future government-sponsored certificate authorities to those who refused key escrow. However, it notes that by 1999, McCain had flipped on the issue of encryption, becoming "Mr. Crypto."
McCain voted against the Telecommunications Act of 1996, on the grounds that it would not ensure competition enough in practice.
In 2002, McCain introduced the Consumer Broadband Deregulation Act of 2002, a deregulation measure aimed at preventing the government from requiring broadband providers to offer access to competing ISPs in the residential broadband market.
In 2006, McCain advocated easing of regulations to allow cable television companies to offer programming on an à la carte, per channel basis, along the lines of the Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007.
McCain is against government regulation of network neutrality unless evidence of abuse exists. He is quoted as saying "let's see how this thing all turns out, rather than anticipate a problem that so far has not arisen in any significant way." Until such a time, he supports allowing network owners to control what sites consumers view, saying, in May 2007, "When you control the pipe you should be able to get profit from your investment".
In October 2009, McCain introduced the Internet Freedom Act which would prevent the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from regulating broadband providers and enforcing net neutrality rules, and characterized such regulation as "onerous" amounting to a government takeover. McCain has received over $890,000 in campaign contributions over his career from companies opposed to net neutrality.
On May 9, 2013, McCain introduced the Television Consumer Freedom Act of 2013; the bill would require cable and satellite providers to offer an a la carte service or lose their compulsory license to rebroadcast television stations, require broadcasters to offer carriage of their channels on a similar a la carte basis, ban blackouts of sporting events at any venue that was constructed using taxpayer money, and would allow the FCC to pull and auction off the broadcast licenses of any broadcaster who shifts their over-the-air programming to cable-only (in response to similar threats in response to the controversy surrounding the service Aereo).
Transportation.
McCain is opposed to federal funding of Amtrak. He considers it to be a "pork barrel project", particularly as far as longer distance trains are concerned.
He has also argued for more stringent safety standards with respect to cars.
Native American affairs.
As a member of the House, McCain sponsored a number of Indian Affairs bills, dealing mainly with giving distribution of lands to reservations and tribal tax status; most of these bills were unsuccessful. He then got the Indian Economic Development Act of 1985 signed into law.
As a senator, McCain often supported the Native American agenda, advocating self-governance and sovereignty and tribe control of adoptions. Along with Senator Daniel Inouye and Representative Mo Udall, McCain was one of the main writers of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises and established the balance between Indian tribal sovereignty and regulatory oversight by the states of such activity. The Act enabled the growth of what would become, two decades later, the $23 billion Indian gaming industry.
In late 2004, McCain helped pass the Arizona Water Settlements Act, the most extensive Indian water settlement in the country's history. In response to the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal and other developments regarding Indian gaming, by 2005 and 2006 McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos by Indian tribes as well as tribes moving across state borders. During 2007, he continued to introduce a number of Indian affairs-related legislation.
Veterans benefits.
McCain initially opposed the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act, introduced by Senator Jim Webb, which provides college-tuition benefits for veterans in a manner similar to that of the original G.I. Bill for veterans of World War II. McCain supported the contention of some in the Defense Department that the original bill's provision of offering four years of full college tuition after only three years of active duty service would entice service members to leave the military sooner than they otherwise might. McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham instead introduced a competing bill, that sought to improve current Montgomery G.I. Bill benefits, but provided a lower total amount of benefits than what Webb proposed. McCain's proposal emphasized benefits for service members who were still active. McCain said: "I want to make sure that we have incentives for people to remain in the military, as well as for people to join the military. I've talked a lot about veterans' health care, so we'll continue to talk about those issues and how to care for vets. I know I can do that, having been one." McCain's alternative would have had a sliding scale of benefits to encourage retention by only offering the top level of benefits to those who stay for six years. McCain also argued that his version would involve less new bureaucracy than Webb's bill. A late May vote on the Webb bill passed 75–22, with McCain missing the vote due to being away from Washington.
In early June 2008, the White House signaled the president might be willing to sign a modified version of the Webb bill, along with the war funding bill, if transferability between spouses and dependents was added onto the new GI Bill. This would make the benefits more valuable to career military personal that would like to pay for their spouse or child's education. On June 19, this provision was added to the war funding bill. With the added transferability provisions for continued military service, McCain said he now supported the bill, because it encouraged additional service beyond three years, mitigating his earlier concerns. McCain, who had not voted in the Senate since April 8, was campaigning in Ohio on June 26 and was not present for the final senate vote on the bill, which passed 92–6 (The only other senator not voting was Ted Kennedy, who was recovering after surgery to remove a brain tumor). Bush signed the war funding bill, along with the veterans education benefits, into law on June 30, 2008.
Federal minimum wage.
McCain opposes the federal minimum wage; instead he believes that each state should decide its own minimum wage. On January 24, 2007 he voted Yes on legislation that would allow employers to pay less than the federal minimum wage if the state set a lower minimum. He also voted in favor of maintaining the filibuster against a bill to increase the federal minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25. This would effectively repeal the federal minimum wage. McCain has voted 19 times against raising the minimum wage.
Equal pay.
McCain has said that he favors the concept of equal pay (the abolition of wage differences based on gender). He has, however, opposed specific legislation that would have given workers more time to discover sex discrimination before bringing suit under the Equal Pay Act of 1963. In 2007, the House of Representatives passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, would have allowed "employees to file charges of pay discrimination within 180 days of the last received paycheck affected by the alleged discriminatory decision." The bill would have overturned the Supreme Court decision in "Ledbetter v. Goodyear". There the Court dismissed a woman's discrimination claim because she had filed it more than 180 days after the "first" affected paycheck. McCain, who said he opposed the bill, was campaigning in New Orleans, Louisiana at the time of the Senate vote in 2008, when the bill died because Democrats could not break a Republican filibuster (The vote in favor of the bill was 56–42, with 60 needed for cloture).
Foreign policy.
McCain has been perceived to be relatively hawkish on foreign policy, despite his advocacy of the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon in 1982 (prior to the attack on the Marine barracks),
Somalia in 1993, and Haiti in 1994. He was one of only 27 Republicans to vote against President Ronald Reagan's decision to put "peacekeeping" troops into Lebanon, saying in a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives that:
In February 2000, during a Republican debate, McCain and other candidates were asked what foreign policy they would change immediately if they became President. "I'd institute a policy that I call 'rogue state rollback,'" McCain said. "I would arm, train, equip, both from without and from within, forces that would eventually overthrow the governments and install free and democratically- elected governments."
McCain's 2006 foreign policy rating, compiled by the "Almanac of American Politics (2008)", was 58% conservative, 40% liberal. 2005 figures were similar: 54% conservative, 45% liberal.
In March 2008, McCain said that the United States should "strengthen our global alliances as the core of a new global compact – a League of Democracies – that can harness the vast influence of the more than one hundred democratic nations around the world to advance our values and defend our shared interests." He said that the United States did not single-handedly win the Cold War, but rather the NATO alliance did so, "in concert with partners around the world."
Among McCain's advisers are Robert Kagan and William Kristol, the co-founders of PNAC and neo-conservatives who were influential in implementing the Iraq War. McCain has also allied himself with President George W. Bush, who brought into his administration a large number of PNAC members and neo-conservatives.
Israel.
In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on April 23, 2002, McCain said that "no American leader should be expected to sell a false peace to our ally, consider Israel's right to self-defense less legitimate than ours, or insist that Israel negotiate a political settlement while terrorism remains the Palestinians' preferred bargaining tool." During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, McCain said, regarding Israel's role in the conflict with Lebanon and Hezbollah, "What would we do if somebody came across our borders and killed our soldiers and captured our soldiers? Do you think we would be exercising total restraint?"
McCain has called for the release of convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, who is serving a life sentence for passing U.S. secrets to Israel.
Israeli-Syrian conflict.
During the 2008 presidential campaign, McCain's advisors stated that they were not in favor of the peace negotiations then ongoing between Israel and Syria.
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
It is unclear whether or not McCain supports the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although McCain has courted the support of individuals and groups that are opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state.
In 2008, McCain's advisors stated that they did not favor continuing the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.
Detention and torture of extrajudicial prisoners.
In October 2005, McCain, a former POW, introduced an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005. That month, the U.S. Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment. The amendment was commonly referred to as the "Amendment on (1) the Army Field Manual and (2) Cruel, Inhumane, Degrading Treatment, amendment #1977" and also known as the McCain Amendment 1977. It became the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 as Title X of the Department of Defense Authorization bill. The amendment prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, by confining interrogations to the techniques in Army Field Manual 34–52, "Intelligence Interrogation".
On December 15, 2005, Bush announced that he accepted McCain's terms and will "make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture, whether it be here at home or abroad." Bush made clear his interpretation of this legislation on December 30, 2005, in a signing statement, reserving what he interpreted to be his Presidential constitutional authority in order to avoid further terrorist attacks.
McCain argues that American military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the US in the name of fighting terrorism. He fears the administration's policy will put American prisoners at risk of torture, summary executions and other atrocities by chipping away at Geneva Conventions. He argues that his rival bill to Bush’s plan gives defendants access to classified evidence being used to convict them and will set tight limits on use of testimony obtained by coercion. Furthermore it offers CIA interrogators some legal protections from charges of abuse, but rejects the administration’s plan to more narrowly define the Geneva Conventions’ standards for humane treatment of prisoners. McCain insists this issue overrides politics. 
McCain, whose 5 and one half years of captivity and torture in Vietnam made him a national celebrity, negotiated (in September 2006) a compromise in the Senate for the Military Commissions Act of 2006, suspending habeas corpus provisions for anyone deemed by the Executive Branch an "unlawful enemy combatant" and barring them from challenging their detentions in court. Coming on the heels of a Supreme Court decision adverse to the White House, McCain's compromise gave a retroactive, nine-year immunity to U.S. officials who authorized, ordered, or committed acts of torture and abuse, and permitted the use of statements obtained through torture to be used in military tribunals so long as the abuse took place by December 30, 2005.
McCain's compromise permitted the President to establish permissible interrogation techniques and to "interpret the meaning and application" of international Geneva Convention standards, so long as the coercion fell short of "serious" bodily or psychological injury. Widely dubbed McCain's "torture compromise", the bill was signed into law by George W. Bush on October 17, 2006, shortly before the 2006 midterm elections.
McCain said in March 2007 that he would "immediately close Guantanamo Bay, move all the prisoners to Fort Leavenworth and truly expedite the judicial proceedings in their cases". On September 19, 2007, he voted against restoring habeas corpus to detainees.
In October 2007, McCain said of waterboarding that, "They presidential candidates should know what it is. It is not a complicated procedure. It is torture." In February 2008 he voted against HR 2082, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which included provisions that would have prevented the CIA from waterboarding prisoners. The bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected, and his spokesman stated: "This wasn't a vote on waterboarding. This was a vote on applying the standards of the field manual to CIA personnel."
Iran.
John McCain has called the crisis with Iran "the most serious crisis we have faced – outside of the entire war on terror – since the end of the Cold War." "Nuclear capability in Iran is unacceptable," said McCain. McCain has criticized Russia and China for causing "gridlock" in the UN Security Council and preventing the sanctioning of Iran as well as other areas of conflict such as Darfur and Burma. If elected, McCain pledges to create a "league of democracies" with the purpose of addressing those conflicts without the approval of China and Russia.
McCain has cited Iran's stance towards Israel as justification for his aggressive policy towards Iran, saying, "Iran is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. That alone should concern us but now they are trying for nuclear capabilities. I totally support the president when he says we will not allow Iran to destroy Israel."
Regarding military action against Iran, McCain has said, "I pray every night that we will avoid a conflict with Iran." He has also said, "There's a whole lot of things we can do before we seriously consider the military option," but clarifying, "I still say there's only one thing worse than military action against Iran and that is a nuclear-armed Iran." His comments regarding "bombing Iran" made to veterans in South Carolina have come under scrutiny, despite McCain's statement that the comments were made in jest.
McCain tried to persuade FIFA to ban Iran from the 2006 World Cup, referring to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Holocaust denials as the reason since such denials in Germany, where the competition was held, are illegal.
In June 2008, a group of congressional Democrats criticized McCain for voting against 2005 legislation that would have toughened sanctions against Iran. "McCain tries to give the impression that he's tough on Iran, but when it came time to stand up to party leaders and Big Oil, John McCain stood down," said senator Frank Lautenberg.
Following the 2009 Iranian election protests, McCain said "It really is a sham that rulers have pulled off, and I hope that we will act." He Tweeted on the subject as well, saying to a reporter, "@jaketapper USA always stands for freedom and democracy!!".
Iraq War.
In February 2000, McCain said "As long as Saddam Hussein is in power, I am convinced that he will pose a threat to our security."
McCain supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the U.S. decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
In April 2004, McCain was asked by Peter G. Peterson what the United States should do if the "Iraqi government asks us to leave, even if we are unhappy about the security situation there?" McCain responded, "I think it's obvious that we would have to leave because— if it was an elected government of Iraq..."
Following the invasion he criticized the Bush Administration's conduct of the occupation, and he later pushed for "significant policy changes" in the Iraq War. He criticized The Pentagon on a number of occasions, most notably in December 2004, concerning low troop strength in Iraq, and has called for a diversification of Iraqi national forces to better represent the multiple ethnic groups contained within the country. 
In January 2005, McCain said that "one of our big problems has been the fact that many Iraqis resent American military presence. ... as soon as we can reduce our visibility as much as possible, the better I think it is going to be."
In November 2005 McCain said in a speech that the U.S. government must do more to keep public support high for the war, and that more troops were needed, as well as a number of other changes in the U.S. approach to the war. He concluded his speech by saying that "America, Iraq and the world are better off with Saddam Hussein in prison rather than in power…and we must honor their sacrifice by seeing this mission through to victory." 
In October 2006, McCain said that he had "no confidence" in then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, but was not calling for his resignation at that time, saying that "the president picks his team, and the president has the right to stay with that team if he wants to."
On January 10, 2007, Bush announced the commitment of more than 20,000 additional troops as a part of the Iraqi troop surge of 2007. McCain was a leading advocate for the move, leading some Democrats to call the policy the "McCain Doctrine". Days after the announcement, McCain appeared on CBS' "Face the Nation" and said, "This is a chance under the new leadership of General Petraeus and Admiral Fallon to have a chance to succeed. Do I believe it can succeed? Yes, I do." On February 4, he criticised a bipartisan non-binding resolution opposing the troop buildup, calling it a "vote of no confidence" in the US military. The next day, McCain said, "I don't think it's appropriate to say that you disapprove of a mission and you don't want to fund it and you don't want it to go, but yet you don't take the action necessary to prevent it".
McCain's April 11, 2007 speech on Iraq was delivered to the Virginia Military Institute Corps of Cadets after his return from Iraq. He supported a new strategy in Iraq and opposed Democratic efforts towards troop withdrawal. McCain repeated his criticism of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War on April 29 in Elko, Nevada, and stated that Rumsfeld would be remembered as "one the worst secretaries of defense in history".
On September 19, 2007, McCain voted against requiring minimum periods between deployments.
In November 2007, on the Charlie Rose show on PBS, Rose asked if South Korea might be an analogy of where Iraq might be, in terms of an American presence, over the next 20 to 25 years. McCain replied that he didn't think so – even if there were no (ongoing) casualties, saying "I can see an American presence for a while. But eventually I think because of the nature of the society in Iraq and the religious aspects of it that America eventually withdraws. 
On January 3, 2008 at a campaign stop in Derry, New Hampshire, when a questioner said, "President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years," McCain responded:
"Make it a hundred. We've been in Japan for 60 years, we've been in South Korea for 50 years or so. That'd be fine with me as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed. That's fine with me. I hope it will be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where Al Qaeda is training, recruiting, equipping, and motivating people every single day."
In March 2008, McCain said of Iraq and terrorism that "Gen. Petraeus is correct when he says that the central battleground in the struggle against al Qaeda is Iraq and Osama bin Laden just confirmed that again with his comments last week."
In April 2008 he said, "There are tough decisions ahead and America deserves leaders that are up to the challenge. As president, I will ensure that our troops come home victorious in this war that is part of the larger struggle against radical Islamic extremism and will continue to make keeping our nation secure my highest priority."
In a May 15, 2008 speech in Columbus, Ohio, McCain said:
By January 2013, America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom. The Iraq War has been won….Iraq is a functioning democracy, although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension. Violence still occurs, but it is spasmodic and much reduced….The United States maintains a military presence there, but a much smaller one, and it does not play a direct combat role.
In a June 11, 2008 interview on NBC's "Today Show", McCain was asked whether, in light of recent progress from the troop surge in Iraq, he had a clearer idea of when U.S. troops could begin withdrawing. He replied:
No, but that's not too important. What's important is casualties in Iraq. Americans are in South Korea. Americans are in Japan. American troops are in Germany. That's all fine. American casualties, and the ability to withdraw. We will be able to withdraw... But the key to it is we don't want any more Americans in harm's way.
Afghanistan.
McCain was an advocate for strong military measures against those responsible for the September 11 attacks in 2001 and supported the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. In a late October 2001 "Wall Street Journal" op-ed piece he wrote, "America is under attack by a depraved, malevolent force that opposes our every interest and hates every value we hold dear." He advocated an overwhelming, not incremental, approach against the Taliban in Afghanistan, including the use of ground forces, saying, "War is a miserable business. Let's get on with it." 
In October 2005, McCain said “Afghanistan, we don’t read about anymore, because it’s succeeded. And by the way, there’s several reasons, including NATO participation and other reasons, why Afghanistan is doing as well as it is.”
In December 2006, asked if the U.S. would send more troops to Afghanistan, McCain said, "The British have said that they will be sending additional troops, taking troops out of Iraq and into Afghanistan. If it's necessary, we will, and I'm sure we would be agreeable, but the focus here is more on training the Afghan National Army and the police, as opposed to the increased U.S. troop presence."
In July 2008, McCain said that reducing U.S. forces in Iraq would free up troops for Afghanistan, where "at least" three additional brigades, or about 15,000 troops, must be sent. A campaign aide said later that McCain's proposal included a combination of both U.S. and NATO forces.
Libya.
On August 14, 2009, McCain, along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham, met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in Tripoli "to talk... about a transfer of American military equipment." At the meeting, Gaddafi's son Muatassim "emphasized Libya's interest in the purchase of U.S. lethal and non-lethal military equipment," and McCain "assured Muatassim that the United States wanted to provide Libya with the equipment it needs." Following the meeting, McCain sent out a tweet declaring that he had spent "an interesting evening with an interesting man." During the 2011 Libyan civil war, McCain called for the removal of Gaddafi from power, due to Gaddafi having "'American blood on his hands' from the 1988 Lockerbie bombing." In April 2011, he became the 'highest-profile Western politician' to visit the rebels in Libya, urging Washington to consider a ground attack that aims for the absolute removal of Gaddafi.
Kosovo.
"It is time to bring Kosovo – and the Balkans with it – out of the 1990s and into the 21st century by recognizing Kosovo's independence. Eleven years ago, that region was in flames, characterized by ethnic cleansing and widespread violence. For the first time the region is today poised to move forward, with final status for Kosovo and transitioning continuing responsibilities there to increasing European control – at long last closing the door on the region's painful past," stated McCain at the Munich Security Conference in February 2008. During the crisis in the Serbian breakaway province of Kosovo in 1999, McCain urged President Clinton to use all necessary force.
North Korea.
In October 2006, McCain said that he believed the former President Bill Clinton and his administration were to blame for the North Korea's weapons of mass destruction. He said that the U.S. had "concluded an unenforceable and untransparent agreement", allowing North Korea to keep plutonium rods in a reactor. In an article he wrote for the November/December 2007 issue of "Foreign Affairs", he referred to North Korea as a "totalitarian regime," and said that it was necessary for North Korea be committed to "verifiable denuclearization" and "full accounting of all its nuclear materials and facilities" before any "lasting diplomatic agreement can be reached."
In a 2003 interview with PBS' Frontline he called the Clinton policy towards North Korea "appeasement" and said the U.S. should've attacked North Korea in the Clinton years to prevent a nuclear capability.
" MARTIN SMITH: You called Clinton an appeaser.
Sen. JOHN McCAIN: Well, you know, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's appeasement.
MARTIN SMITH: So what was the alternative?
Sen. JOHN McCAIN: The alternative was to say, "You stop this development of nuclear weapons, or we exercise every option we have," not excluding the military option, sanctions, conversations with the Japanese, the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Russians. Exercise every option. Don't engage in bribery, which is what it was. It was bribery.
MARTIN SMITH: But in retrospect, they would have 50, 60 bombs by now, and they don't.
Sen. JOHN McCAIN: In retrospect—in retrospect, if they hadn't stopped doing it, we would have acted militarily. And we wouldn't be facing the magnitude of the threat that we're facing now."
Nuclear weapons.
McCain voted in favor of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction in 1991. He voted to ratify the START II strategic arms limitation treaty in 1996.
McCain voted against the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1999.
In March 2008, McCain said that United States should reduce its nuclear arsenal to encourage other nations to reduce their arsenals:
"Forty years ago, the five declared nuclear powers came together in support of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and pledged to end the arms race and move toward nuclear disarmament. The time has come to renew that commitment. We do not need all the weapons currently in our arsenal. The United States should lead a global effort at nuclear disarmament consistent with our vital interests and the cause of peace." 
Pakistan.
McCain maintains a relatively moderate stance concerning Pakistan, although he has recognized the South Asian nation as an important part of US Foreign Policy. In the aftermath of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination (in December 2007) McCain appeared to rule out the option of US forces entering Pakistan, saying that it was not an appropriate time to "threaten" Pakistan.
Russia.
McCain has been one of the foremost Senate critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin: "I looked into his eyes and saw three letters: a K, a G and a B", referring to Putin's membership in the KGB during the Soviet era. He has said that Putin is "going to cause a lot of difficulties" and that he is "trying to reassert the Russian empire." In January 2007, McCain said that he thought Putin was using Russia's energy sources as a political weapon.
McCain was a fierce opponent of Putin's Invasion of Chechnya describing it as "a bloody war against Chechnya's civilian population." He stated "Yes, there are Chechen terrorists, but there are many Chechens who took up arms only after the atrocities committed by Russian forces serving first under Boris Yeltsin's and then Putin's orders." Like others, he disputes that the Russian apartment bombings had anything to do with Chechens, and that instead "There remain credible allegations that Russia's FSB had a hand in carrying out these attacks". He also blamed Russia's security services for political assassinations as well as the assassinations of independent journalists.
In 2005 McCain and Connecticut senator Joseph Lieberman brought a draft resolution with the requirement to suspend membership of Russia in the G8, an international forum. The same year he initiated Senate acceptance of a resolution charging the Russian government with "political motivations" in litigation concerning Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev. In October 2007, McCain again called for removal of Russia from the G8:
McCain is a strong supporter of ballistic national missile defenses. Russia threatened to place short-range nuclear missiles on the Russia’s border with NATO if the United States refuses to abandon plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech Republic. In April 2007, Putin warned of a new Cold War if the Americans deployed the shield in the former Eastern Bloc. Putin also said that Russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under a Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 with the United States. 
In 2008 McCain accused Russian leader Vladimir Putin of clear aspirations of wanting to restore the czarist empire. McCain stated that Putin is still running Russia, saying he is "still by far the most powerful and influential person in Russia," and that "It's very clear that Russian ambitions are to restore the old Russian Empire. Not the Soviet Union, but the Russian Empire." By attacking Georgia Russian leaders risk "the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world." In his Republican nomination speech, McCain said about Russia concerning the Russian-Georgian conflict that "They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world’s oil supply."
Georgia and South Ossetia War.
During the 2008 South Ossetia war, McCain reacted strongly to Russia’s widening assault against Georgia. McCain said Europe and other nations must be united against such acts, and proclaimed support for the U.S.’s closest ally among the democratizing former Soviet republics. He also pointed out that NATO should reconsider its decision to deny Georgia the fast track for NATO membership. That decision “might have been viewed as a green light by Russia for its attacks on Georgia,” McCain said. 
McCain also stated that Americans are supporting the "brave little nation" of Georgia against Russia's military attacks. McCain spoke with President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia, and told him "I know I speak for every American when I say, 'Today, we are all Georgians.'" "Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory. What is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between Russian and Georgian military forces," McCain said on August 8, 2008.
On August 8, 2008, he said "We should immediately call a meeting of the North Atlantic Council to assess Georgia's security and review measures NATO can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation."
Czech Republic.
On July 14, 2008, McCain expressed concern about Russia's reducing the energy supplies to Czech Republic: "I was concerned about a couple of steps that the Russian government took in the last several days. One was reducing the energy supplies to CzechoslovakiaApparently that is in reaction to the Czech’s agreement with us concerning missile defense, and again some of the Russian now announcement they are now retargeting new targets, something they abandoned at the end of the Cold War, is also a concern."
Cuba.
When McCain was running for president in 2000, he supported the normalizing of relations with Cuba, even if Fidel Castro remained in power, provided that the Cuban government did certain things to democratize Cuba. McCain compared the situation to normalizing relations with Vietnam.
Ukraine.
According to "JohnMcCain.com": "There is disturbing evidence Russia is already laying the groundwork to apply the same arguments used to justify its intervention in Georgia to other parts of its near abroad – most ominously in Crimea. This strategically important peninsula is part of Ukraine, but with a large ethnic Russian population and the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol." "Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support – we, the United States – will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO""And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol," said McCain during the first presidential debate of 2008 on September 26.
Egyptian demonstrations.
John McCain tweeted "Regrettably the time has come for President Mubarak to step down and relinquish power. It's in the best interest of Egypt, its people and its military."
The following morning in an interview with "Good Morning America" he said the following on Egypt "This virus spreading throughout the Middle East proves the universality of human yearnings, and probably the only place where you won't see these demonstrations is Iraq." He also said on Fox News to Gretta Van Susteren "This virus is spreading throughout the Middle East. The president of Yemen, as you know, just made the announcement that he wasn’t running again. This, I would argue, is probably the most dangerous period of history in – of our entire involvement in the Middle East, at least in modern times. Israel is in danger of being surrounded by countries that are against the very existence of Israel, are governed by radical organizations."
Syrian civil war.
During the Syrian civil war that began in 2011, McCain was a vocal supporter of the U.S. intervening militarily in the conflict on the side of the anti-government forces. He called for arming the Free Syrian Army with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a no-fly zone over the country.
Structure of government.
Judicial appointments.
McCain is a believer in judges who would, as he sees it, "strictly interpret the Constitution," and is against what he sees as “the systemic abuse of our federal courts" by judges who “preemptively" decide American social policy.
In 1987, he supported the failed confirmation of Reagan nominee Robert Bork. He then supported and voted for the appointments of both-Bushes nominees David Souter, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, and Samuel Alito. In 1993 and 1994, McCain voted to confirm Clinton nominees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom he considered to be qualified for the Supreme Court. He would later explain that "under our Constitution, it is the president's call to make." He has made clear, though, that he never would have nominated Breyer or Ginsburg himself (or Souter or Gerald Ford appointee John Paul Stevens). He also stated some of his favorite past Supreme Court justices include Sandra Day O'Connor, William Rehnquist, and John Harlan. He has described Alito and, especially, John Roberts as currently sitting judges he likes; he said the two "would serve as the model for my own nominees if that responsibility falls to me." 
For lower courts, he stated he would appoint a mix of moderates and conservatives. While McCain is opposed to abortion, he stated that he would not use abortion as the litmus test.
Gang of 14 and Senate filibuster.
On May 23, 2005, McCain led fourteen Senators to forge a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial filibuster, thus eliminating the need for the Republican leadership's attempt to implement the so-called "nuclear option" (also known as the "constitutional option"). Under the agreement, Senators would retain the power to filibuster a judicial nominee, the Democrats would agree to use this power against Bush nominees only in an "extraordinary circumstance", the Republicans involved would agree to vote against the nuclear option if implemented, and three of the most contested Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate. The agreement may have affected the likelihood that a Senate minority would defeat subsequent nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court (e.g., the nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito). Such a defeat by a filibustering Senate minority could have become "less likely" if the so-called "nuclear option" had been successful, but such a defeat could have become "more likely" if the nuclear option had been voted down.
Religion and the nation.
On February 28, 2000, during his presidential primary campaign, McCain sharply criticized leaders of the religious right as "agents of intolerance" allied to his rival, Governor George W. Bush, and denounced what he said were the tactics of "division and slander." McCain singled out the evangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as "corrupting influences on religion and politics" and said parts of the religious right were divisive.
In an interview in March 2007, David Brody for CBN news asked McCain about these comments, "Do you regret saying it? Do you feel like you need to apologize for it at all?" to which McCain responded, "... I was angry. And sometimes you say things in anger that you don't mean. But I have put that behind me. It's over."
When interviewed in 2007 by Beliefnet, a website that covers religious affairs, McCain was asked if he thought a non-Christian should be president of the United States. He answered, "I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles, personally, I prefer someone who has a grounding in my faith." McCain also stated his agreement with the belief that the U.S. is a "Christian nation." On September 30, 2007, he clarified his remarks by saying "What I do mean to say is the United States of America was founded on the values of Judeo-Christian values, which were translated by our founding fathers which is basically the rights of human dignity and human rights." McCain also stated, “I would vote for a Muslim if he or she was the candidate best able to lead the country and defend our political values.”
In February 2013, McCain reiterated his belief that America is "a Judeo-Christian nation."
Campaign finance regulation.
An advocate of government restrictions on campaign spending and contributions, McCain made campaign finance reform a central issue in his 2000 presidential bid. With Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin he pushed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 which banned unlimited donations to national political parties (soft money) and curtailed issue-advocacy ads. Because of McCain and Feingold's involvement, the law is commonly referred to as the "McCain-Feingold Act."
President's question time.
In May 2008, McCain stated his intention, if elected, to create a Presidential equivalent of the British conditional convention of Prime Minister's Questions. In a policy speech on May 15 which outlined a number of ideas, McCain said, "I will ask Congress to grant me the privilege of coming before both houses to take questions, and address criticism, much the same as the Prime Minister of Great Britain appears regularly before the House of Commons."
George F. Will of "The Washington Post" criticized the proposal in an Op-Ed piece, saying that a Presidential Question Time would endanger separation of powers as the President of the United States, unlike the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is not a member of the legislature. Will ended the piece by saying, "Congress should remind a President McCain that the 16 blocks separating the Capitol from the White House nicely express the nation's constitutional geography." However, critics of Will's review, such as Steven Spadijer point out that Question Time would be a check and balance in and of itself: 
Energy and environmental policy.
McCain has a lifetime pro-environment rating of 24 on a scale of 100 on the League of Conservation Voters's "National Environmental Scorecard," which reflects the consensus of experts from about 20 leading environmental organizations. According to the League of Conservation Voters' 2006 National Environmental Scorecard, McCain took an "anti-environment" stance on four of seven environmental resolutions during the second session of the 109th congress. The four resolutions dealt with issues such as offshore drilling, an Arctic national wildlife refuge, low-income energy assistance, and environmental funding. 
McCain is a member of the Honorary Board of the Republicans for Environmental Protection organization.
Energy.
In a June 2008 analysis of McCain's positions, the "Los Angeles Times" said that "the Arizona senator has swerved from one position to another over the years, taking often contradictory stances on the federal government's role in energy policy."
Energy dependence.
On April 23, 2007, McCain gave a major speech on his energy policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the Ronald Reagan Building & International Trade Center in Washington, D.C. He said that U.S. dependence on foreign oil is "a major strategic vulnerability, a serious threat to our security, our economy and the well-being of our planet," explicitly connecting energy independence with national security, climate change, and the environment.
In 2008, he said that this dependence "has been thirty years in the making, and was caused by the failure of politicians in Washington to think long term about the future of the country."
McCain generally supports increased energy efficiency, but has not announced specific targets. He has called for raising gas mileage standards to 35 m.p.g.
Oil price increases.
"I believe there needs to be a thorough and complete investigation of speculators to find out whether speculation has been going on and, if so, how much it has affected the price of a barrel of oil." "I am very angry, frankly, at the oil companies. Not only because of the obscene profits they've made, but their failure to invest in alternative energy to help us eliminate our dependence on foreign oil," McCain said on June 13, 2008.
Offshore drilling.
In McCain's campaign for the presidency in 2000, he supported the federal ban on offshore drilling for oil. In June 2008, McCain reversed his longstanding objection to offshore drilling. Stating that he had changed his views because of high gas prices and dependence on imports, he endorsed legislation that would give each coastal state the power to determine whether to allow offshore drilling.
ANWR.
McCain has generally opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but did vote in favor of preserving the budget for ANWR oil drilling.
Alternative energy sources.
McCain has voted to reduce federal funds for renewable and solar energy. He opposed tax credits in 2001 and 2006 for companies that generate power from solar, wind, geothermal and ocean wave energy.
Ethanol for energy.
In 2000, McCain skipped most of the Iowa caucuses during his presidential bid, in large part because his opposition to ethanol subsidies was a nonstarter in a state where making corn into fuel was a large and profitable business. 
While campaigning in 2006 in the Midwest, McCain called ethanol a "vital, vital alternative energy source."
In April 2007, McCain proposed increasing ethanol imports.
In May 2008, in response to rising food prices linked to an increased production of ethanol, McCain along with 23 other Republican Senators asked the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce requirements established by Congress in 2007 that more ethanol and other renewable fuels be blended into the U.S. gasoline supply. The group wrote:
Although many factors may contribute to high food costs, food-to-fuel mandates are the only factors that can be reconsidered in light of current circumstances. 
Nuclear power.
McCain voted five times in the 1990s against taxpayer aid for research on new-generation nuclear reactors. Through 2003, he opposed federal loan guarantees to help the nuclear industry finance new plants.
In 2005, McCain began supporting more taxpayer assistance for nuclear energy, as part of his proposed legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions. In April 2007, McCain proposed better harnessing of nuclear power, much as Europe has managed to do. McCain is now calling for 45 new nuclear reactors to be built in the United States by 2030. In 2008, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Public Citizen estimated that one version of McCain's bill would authorize more than $3.7 billion in subsidies for new nuclear plants.
McCain has long been a supporter of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada. In 2008, however, on the eve of a campaign appearance in Nevada, he called for the establishment of "an international repository for spent nuclear fuel", which, he said, might make it unnecessary to open Yucca Mountain.
The Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Obama campaign have charged that, in a videotaped interview in 2007, McCain reiterated his support for transporting nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain but said he would not be comfortable with such transports going through Phoenix, Arizona. The McCain campaign responded by attacking Obama's record on energy issues.
McCain has also been criticized for failing to deal with nuclear waste contamination problems in his home state of Arizona.
McCain has repeatedly cited France as a role model because it gets nearly 80% of its electricity from nuclear power, which helps the country to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions, and has made it one of the world's leading net exporters of energy.
Global warming.
The McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act of 2003 was defeated in October 2004 by a margin of 43–55. This bill however would have required power stations to reduce their emissions to the same levels that they were in 2000, three years previous by the year 2010. An act that though stated to be "a very minimal proposal" by Senator McCain to the Senate, "that while woefully inadequate should be the first step." The Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007 was introduced by Senator Joseph Lieberman, McCain and other co-sponsors in January 2007, with McCain commenting "we continue to learn more about the science of climate change and the dangerous precedence of not addressing this environmental problem. The science tells us that urgent and significant action is needed."
In April 2007, McCain called global warming "a serious and urgent economic, environmental and national security challenge" and said that the problem "isn't a Hollywood invention."
In September 2007, McCain said that he supported a 65% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. 
In a campaign video in January 2008, McCain said "I believe that America did the right thing by not joining the Kyoto treaty, but I believe that if we could get China and India into it, then the United States should seriously consider on our terms joining with every other nation in the world to try and reduce greenhouse gases. It's got to be a global effort."
In a February 2010 Arizona radio interview, after the host had made lengthy comments claiming that “80 percent” of global warming science “is based on fraud and misinformation,” McCain, who had previously countered such inaccurate statements, made no correction.
Cap and trade.
McCain's position on greenhouse gas emissions calls for a timetable mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency that gradually reduces greenhouse ceilings. McCain's stance also includes an emission credit system that regulates each metric ton of greenhouse a company produces. This plan is to be put into effect by 2012.
McCain is co-sponsor of a Senate cap-and-trade bill designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and is seen as a bipartisan leader on the issue. However, in a radio interview in February 2010, he denied ever supporting cap-and-trade. 
By September 2009, McCain had largely disengaged from the climate change debate, and criticized the Waxman-Markey Climate Change Bill out of the House as "appearto be a cap & tax bill that I won't support" and having "a lot of special deals for a lot of special interests." The senator also had both substantive and procedural objections to the cap-and-trade bill being worked on in the Senate.
Automobile standards.
In February 2007, McCain and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called for a nationwide roll-out of California's new low carbon fuel standard. In April 2007, McCain proposed moving from exploration to production of plug-in electric vehicles.
In late June 2008, McCain said he favored nationwide limits on carbon emissions from cars, saying "my goal would be to see a federal standard that every state could embrace". In mid-July, McCain, regarding whether states such as California should be permitted to set tough greenhouse gas limits on vehicles, that "It's hard for me to tell states that they can't impose ... whatever standards that would apply within their own states." He said "I guess at the end of the day, I support the states being able to do that."
Everglades.
In 2007, McCain sided with Bush against Florida Republicans in opposing a Congressional override of Bush's veto of a water projects bill that would have approved $2 billion for restoration of the Everglades, despite $7.8 billion that had been earmarked for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) in 2000. The State of Florida has, since the passing of CERP, spent $2 billion on CERP initiatives, though the federal government has declined to fund initiatives written in CERP. In 2004, a group of real estate developers, led by a major fundraiser to McCain's campaign, Al Hoffman, worked to block state efforts to follow through on restoration works. McCain said on June 4, 2008 while touring the Everglades, that he supported "adequate funding" for restoration but that it had to be achieved "without sacrificing fiscal responsibility", though he declined to state which CERP programs were irresponsible.
Colorado River water allocation.
The Colorado River Compact allocates the water of the Colorado River among seven states. McCain has called for renegotiating the Compact, a statement that has been interpreted as a suggestion that less water be reserved for the Upper Basin states (Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming) in order to provide more for the Lower Basin states (California, Arizona, and Nevada).
Social policy.
McCain's 2006 rating by the Almanac of American Politics (2008) on Social Policy is 46% conservative, 53% liberal. (2005: 64% conservative, 23% liberal.) McCain also has an 83% rating from the Christian Coalition, which indicates many socially conservative views such as voting yes on $75M for abstinence education, yes on recommending a Constitutional ban on flag desecration, and voting yes on memorial prayers and religious symbols at school.
Abortion.
McCain has stated that he believes life begins at the moment of conception and that embryos should be afforded full human rights.
In June 1984, McCain voted for H.AMDT.942, the Siljander amendment, to H.R.5490, "An amendment to define "person" as including unborn children from the moment of conception".
In 1999, McCain said of Roe v. Wade, "I'd love to see a point where it is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short term, or even the long term, I would not support repeal of "Roe v. Wade", which would then force X number of women in America to illegal and dangerous operations." 
However, on February 18, 2007, McCain stated, "I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned." 
McCain has said he supports amending the U.S. Constitution to ban abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or risk to the mother's life.
McCain has voted against abortion 115 out of 119 times in the Senate including co-sponsoring the Federal Abortion Ban.
McCain has a consistent 0 percent rating from the Pro-Choice group, NARAL, and a 75% rating from the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC).
Sex education and birth control.
McCain is against federal funding of birth control and sex education; his opposition included a vote against spending $100 million to reduce teen pregnancy by education and contraceptives. 
McCain voted in 2003 and 2005 against legislation requiring insurance plans that cover prescription drugs to also cover birth control.
Affirmative action.
In 1998 McCain opposed an Arizona ballot proposal to end affirmative action. He stated, "Rather than engage in divisive ballot initiatives, we must have a dialogue and cooperation and mutual efforts together to provide for every child in America to fulfill their expectations." That same year, McCain voted to keep a program which directed ten percent of federal surface transportation funds to firms owned by women and racial minorities. In 1999 McCain pushed legislation which would give companies tax breaks for selling media properties to minorities. In 2003 McCain reintroduced the legislation.
In July 2008, "USA Today" reported that "McCain said Sunday that he favors a proposed referendum in Arizona that would ban affirmative action, reversing a position he took a decade ago." He also said that he had always been against quotas.
Disability rights.
McCain backs reauthorization of the Americans with Disabilities Act, saying in a July 26, 2008 address to the Americans with Disabilities Conference that he will support the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 passed by the House of Representatives when it comes to a Senate vote. McCain has not completed a questionnaire on disability issues furnished to his campaign by the American Association of People with Disabilities.
Alcohol.
McCain's family has close ties to Anheuser-Busch through its Hensley & Co. distributor. McCain has recused himself from voting on bills before Congress dealing with alcohol-related matters.
Crime.
McCain voted Yes on a 2004 crime bill which mandated prison terms for crimes involving firearms and stricter penalties for other gun and drug law violations.
McCain has indicated that he supports the use of the death penalty, mandatory prison terms for selling illegal drugs, and stronger restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns. McCain is a proponent of mandatory sentencing in general.
Domestic security.
McCain voted in support of the USA PATRIOT Act. In a speech in Westport, Connecticut, he said that "sometimes democracies overreact" during times of national security crises, and pledged to periodically review the Patriot Act in order to safeguard civil liberties.
McCain voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act, extending the measure with some amendments clarifying the rights of an individual who has received FISA orders to challenge nondisclosure requirements and to refuse disclosure of the name of their attorney. Voting against this bill would have terminated the Patriot Act.
McCain voted to extend the Patriot Act’s Wiretap Provision. This piece of legislation would allow the FBI to use roaming wiretaps on U.S. residents and would concede to the Federal Agents entry and access to corporate accounts. Voting for this bill would extend the Patriot Act to December 31, 2009, thereby making its provisions permanent whereas voting against this bill would keep the Patriot Act provisional.
In 2010, McCain cosponsored a bill, the Enemy Belligerent Interrogation, Detention and Prosecution Act, that would authorize the U.S. military to arrest anyone, U.S. citizen or otherwise, who is suspected of terrorist associations and detain them indefinitely, without right to a trial or a lawyer.
Conscription (the draft).
In 1999, when the U.S. military was experiencing significant recruiting shortfalls, McCain was one of several members of Congress who mused publicly about reinstating the draft. 
In a December 2007 interview, McCain said that reinstating the draft would be a "terrific mistake" and that "the all-volunteer force is working, and it's the most professional and best trained and equipped we've ever had." 
In a November/December 2007 essay in "Foreign Affairs", McCain wrote, "In 1947, the Truman administration launched a massive overhaul of the nation's foreign policy, defense, and intelligence agencies to meet the challenges of the Cold War. Today, we must do the same to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. Our armed forces are seriously overstretched and underresourced. As president, I will increase the size of the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps from the currently planned level of roughly 750,000 troops to 900,000 troops. Enhancing recruitment will require more resources and will take time, but it must be done as soon as possible."
At a town hall meeting on June 24, 2008, McCain stated, "I don't know what would make a draft happen unless we were in an all-out World War III." He further stated, "I do not believe the draft is even practicable or desirable."
In September 2007, while speaking about issuing a draft, McCain said, "One, it's the best military we've ever had, it just isn't big enough. Two, there's never been a draft that I've ever heard of since World War II that was fair. What we've done is we find rich people find a way out, and lower income people are the ones that serve. I might consider it, I don't think it's necessary, but I might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve. But it just doesn't happen. And the other thing is that, because you know from here in Brauman, it takes intensive training with the equipment and the technical skills that now our people are required to engage in, that it makes it not conducive to a short term. Now they enlist for 4 years. We used to draft people almost for 2 years or even 18 months so it's much more difficult."
Education.
McCain supports the use of school vouchers. Some of McCain's votes include voting yes on school vouchers in DC, yes on education savings accounts, yes on allowing more flexibility in federal school rules, and voting no on $5 billion for grants to local educational agencies. He supports merit pay for teachers, along with firing them if they don't meet certain standards. He sponsored the Education A-Plus bill in 1997 and again in 1999, which would have allowed parents to open tax-free savings accounts for their children's school expenses, such as tutoring, computers and books. McCain co-sponsored the Child Nutrition Act, which would provide federal funding for at-risk children. He said when running for President in 2000 that he would take $5.4 billion away from sugar, gas and ethanol subsidies and pour that money into a test voucher program for every poor school district in America. He voted against diverting $51.9 million away from the Department of Labor and putting it towards after-school community learning centers, and he voted against an amendment which would fund smaller class sizes rather than providing funds for private tutors.
In 2005, McCain announced that he supported the inclusion of intelligent design teaching in schools. He told the "Arizona Daily Star" that, "I think that there has to be all points of view presented. But they've got to be thoroughly presented. So to say that you can only teach one line of thinking … or one belief on how people and the world was created I think there's nothing wrong with teaching different schools of thought." In 2006 he seemed to back off the position a bit, saying, "Should design be taught as a science class? Probably not." McCain's 2005 book "Character Is Destiny" had included a highly complimentary chapter on Charles Darwin, in which McCain wrote, "Darwin helped explain nature's laws. He did not speculate, in his published theories at least, on the origin of life. The only undeniable challenge the theory of evolution poses to Christian beliefs is its obvious contradiction of the idea that God created the world as it is in less than a week."
In 2006, McCain voted to increase the Pell Grant scholarship to a maximum of $4,500, increases future math and science teacher student loan forgiveness to $23,000, and restore education program cuts slated for vocational education, adult education, GEAR UP, and TRIO. On July 29, 2007, McCain voted against a bill increasing federal student loans and Pell Grants and expanding eligibility for financial aid. In 2008, he expressed support for increasing the funding of Pell Grants, saying, "We should not burden our young men and women after college with debt."
Gun control.
In a speech before the National Rifle Association in September 2007, McCain said "For more than two decades, I've opposed the efforts of the anti-gun crowd to ban guns, ban ammunition, ban magazines, and paint gun owners as some kind of fringe group; dangerous in 'modern' America. Some even call you 'extremists.' My friends, gun owners are not extremists, you are the core of modern America." McCain was a signatory of an amicus brief (friend of the court) filed on behalf of 55 U.S. Senators, 250 Representatives and Vice-President Dick Cheney, advising that the Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller be affirmed, overturning the ban on handguns not otherwise restricted by Congress.
McCain has received fair to poor ratings on gun issues from the National Rifle Association, garnering a C+. According to a review by Gun Owners of America (GOA), "in 2001, McCain went from being a supporter of anti-gun bills to being a lead sponsor". McCain's GOA rating went from a "C-" in 2000 to an "F-" in 2006.
Illegal drugs.
McCain has said that as president he would push for more money and military help to drug-supplying nations such as Colombia. He supports expanding the use of federally funded drug treatment and prevention programs and forging public/private partnerships. McCain supported the Drug Free Borders Act of 1999, which provided $1 billion to increase detection of illegal drugs entering the country and also supported the authorization of $53 million in international development funds to stop illegal narcotics.
In 1999, in a Republican presidential debate at Dartmouth College, McCain opposed the legalization of marijuana. He said, "We’re losing the war on drugs. We ought to say, 'It’s not a war anymore,' or we really ought to go after it. And there was a time in our history when we weren’t always losing the war on drugs. It was when Nancy Reagan had a very simple program called 'Just Say No.' And young Americans were reducing the usage of drugs in America." At the debate, McCain called marijuana a "gateway drug".
Immigration.
McCain has promoted the legislation and eventually the granting of citizenship to the estimated 12–20 million illegal aliens in the United States and the creation of an additional guest worker program with an option for permanent immigration. His prominent role in promoting the Senate's 2006 immigration legislation, including an initial cosponsorhip role with Ted Kennedy, made him a focus of the debate in 2006, and his support for S.1348 did so again in 2007. The immigration issue caused intense friction within his own party, such as when "The Washington Times" reported that McCain and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham "first checked with Mr. Kennedy before deciding to vote with the Massachusetts Democrat on an amendment to the Senate bill." McCain's immigration stance was widely cited as a major reason for his presidential campaign's difficulty during most of 2007.
In his bid for the 2000 Presidential nomination, McCain supported expansion of the H-1B visa program, a temporary visa for skilled workers. In 2005, he co-sponsored a bill with Ted Kennedy that would expand use of guest worker visas. 
McCain campaigned against Proposition 200, a 2004 Arizona state initiative intended to prevent illegal immigrants from voting, receiving welfare benefits, and mandated state agencies to report illegals to the federal government. McCain argued Prop 200 would be overly expensive to execute, that it would be ineffectual, and that immigration regulation falls only under the purview of the federal government.
McCain has repeatedly argued that low-skilled immigrant labor is necessary to supply service roles that native-born Americans refuse. In one widely remarked-upon incident, he insisted to a union group that none of them would be willing to pick lettuce for fifty dollars an hour. The audience interrupted with offers and several weeks later demonstrators showed up at his Phoenix office to apply for lettuce picking work.
In May 2007, McCain conceded to Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly that passage of amnesty will permanently change the ethnic makeup of the country. He supports a path to citizenship for an estimated twelve to twenty million immigrants, on the condition of a thirteen-year waiting period.
In June 2007, McCain voted in favor of declaring English as the official language of the federal government.
McCain has subsequently stated that the nation's first priority must be to emphasize border security, and that debate over immigration is a secondary issue.
Shortly before its April 2010 passage in the Arizona State Senate, McCain supported Arizona SB1070, which gained national attention as the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure in decades within the United States.
LGBTQ rights and issues.
In 1996 McCain voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would have prohibited discrimination against employees on the basis of sexual orientation. When the bill was reintroduced in 2006, McCain told ABC's This Week, "I don't think we need specific laws that would apply necessarily to people who are gay." On November 7, 2013, he did vote in favor of ENDA.
In October 2006, McCain said he would consider changing the U.S. military's don't ask, don't tell policy: "The day that the leadership of the military comes to me and says, 'Senator, we ought to change the policy,' then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it."
In December 2007, McCain said he supported the policy, citing reports from military leaders that "this policy ought to be continued because it's working."
In January 2010, when Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen – the top civilian and uniform leadership of the military – came out in favor of repealing the policy, McCain said he was "disappointed" by their stance: "At this moment of immense hardship for our armed services, we should not be seeking to overturn the Don't ask, don't tell policy," which he described as "imperfect but effective." McCain also criticized Gates for what he saw as an attempt to usurp Congressional authority over the policy. 
In 2004, McCain voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, arguing that each state should be able to choose whether to recognize same-sex marriage. He supported the failed 2006 Arizona initiative to ban same-sex marriage and the successful California Proposition 8. He also voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 which barred the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages.
When asked if he supported civil unions for homosexuals, McCain said: "I do not." Still, on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on May 22, 2008, McCain said that people ought to be able to enter "legal agreements ... particularly in the case of insurance and other areas", but that the "unique status of marriage" should be retained between a man and a woman."
In July 2008, McCain told "The New York Times" that "I think that we’ve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so, no I don’t believe in gay adoption." Two days later, McCain's Director of Communications said "McCain could have been clearer in the interview in stating that his position on gay adoption is that it is a state issue, just as he made it clear in the interview that marriage is a state issue." John McCain has later said, that despite his opposition, he could see the benefit of a child being adopted by a same-sex couple rather than being at an orphanage.
In 2013, McCain criticized Russia's treatment of LGBT people.
Martin Luther King Holiday.
In 1983, McCain opposed creating a federal holiday in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr.. 
McCain continued his opposition to a holiday for King by supporting Governor of Arizona Evan Mecham's rescinding of the Arizona state holiday for King in 1987. By 1989, McCain reiterated his opposition to the federal holiday, but reversed position on the state holiday, due to the economic boycotts and image problems Arizona was receiving as a result of it not having one. 
In 1990, McCain persuaded Reagan to issue a statement of support for the holiday through McCain’s office, asking Arizonans to "join me in supporting a holiday to commemorate these ideals to which Dr. King dedicated his life." The 1990 referendum failed, and in 1992 McCain supported another referendum for a state holiday, which passed.
In April 2008, McCain said We can be slow as well to give greatness its due, a mistake I made myself long ago when I voted against a federal holiday in memory of Dr. King. I was wrong and eventually realized that, in time to give full support for a state holiday in Arizona. We can all be a little late sometimes in doing the right thing, and Dr. King understood this about his fellow Americans.
Mixed Martial Arts.
McCain saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent. McCain himself led a campaign to ban UFC, calling it "human cockfighting," and sending letters to the governors of all fifty US states asking them to ban the event.
Public service.
McCain believes that more Americans should get involved in public service. "If you find fault with our country, make it a better one...When healthy skepticism sours into corrosive cynicism, our expectations of our government become reduced to the delivery of services. For too many Americans, the idea of good citizenship does not extend beyond walking into a voting booth every two or four years and pulling a lever – and too few Americans demand of themselves even that first obligation of self-government."
Space program.
McCain has expressed his strong support for NASA and the space program.
Stem cell research.
McCain is a member of The Republican Main Street Partnership and supports embryonic stem cell research. McCain had earlier opposed embyronic stem cell research and credits former First Lady Nancy Reagan, a prominent Republican supporter of such research, with changing his mind in 2001. He states that he believes that stem cell research, and indeed embryonic stem cell research, will continue whether or not the U.S. sanctions it, and so it would be the wisest course of action to support it to the extent that the United States will be able to regulate and monitor the use. In July 2008 he said “At the moment I support stem cell research of the potential it has for curing some of the most terrible diseases that afflict mankind.”
McCain opposes embryonic stem cell research that uses cloned human embryos. In 2006 he supported a trio of U.S. Senate bills designed to increase federal funding for adult stem cell research, ban the creation of embryos for research and offer federal support for research using embryos slated for destruction by fertility clinics. In 2007, in what he described as "a very agonizing and tough decision," he voted to allow research using human embryos left over from fertility treatments. [http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Stem_Cell_Research] Pew Forum, 2008
Taxes on cigarettes.
In 1998, McCain supported an unsuccessful bill that would have imposed a federal tax of $1.10 per pack on cigarettes to fund programs to cut underage smoking. "I still regret we did not succeed", he said in October 2007. In 2007, McCain voted against legislation that would have used a 61-cents-per-pack tax to expand a children's health program, saying that he disagreed with the concept: "We are trying to get people not to smoke, and yet we are depending on tobacco to fund a program that's designed for children's health?" In February 2008 he said that he would have a "no new taxes" policy as president.
Vaccination.
On February 28, 2008 McCain told ABC News' Bret Hovell, "It's indisputable that (autism) is on the rise amongst children, the question is what's causing it. And we go back and forth and there's strong evidence that indicates that it's got to do with a preservative in vaccines."

Khaled Abu el-Dahab

An Egyptian medical student, Khaled Abu el-Dahab (Abul-Dahab) was arrested and convicted of terrorism. He is alleged to have been a right-hand man to Ali Mohamed, who had been an American CIA agent and Special Forces soldier.
Ali Mohamed travelled north from California with el-Dehab, who later told Egyptian interrogators he had withdrawn US$3,000 from a Californian bank account on orders of Osama bin Laden himself, to offer as bail money to lawyer Phil Rankin. The pair hoped to have Essam Marzouk released and possibly smuggle him into the United States.
In 2002, Abul-Dahab confessed to Egyptian interrogators that he had funded the 1995 attack on the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan on orders from bin Laden, and had transferred money from a Californian bank account to Pakistan to finance the attack.

1955 college football season

The 1955 NCAA football season saw the Oklahoma Sooners win the national championship after going 10-0-0. Although the final poll was taken before the postseason bowl games, Oklahoma played against the nation's other unbeaten and untied (10-0-0) team, the Maryland Terrapins, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, and won 20-6. 
During the 20th century, the NCAA had no playoff for the college football teams that would later be described as "Division I-A". The NCAA did recognize a national champion based upon the final results of "wire service" (AP and UPI) polls. The extent of that recognition came in the form of acknowledgment in the annual "NCAA Football Guide" of the "unofficial" national champions. The AP poll in 1955 consisted of the votes of as many as 391 sportswriters. Though not all writers voted in every poll, each would give their opinion of the twenty best teams. Under a point system of 20 points for first place, 19 for second, etc., the "overall" ranking was determined. Although the rankings were based on the collective opinion of the representative sportswriters, the teams that remained "unbeaten and untied" were generally ranked higher than those that had not. A defeat, even against a strong opponent, tended to cause a team to drop in the rankings, and a team with two or more defeats was unlikely to remain in the Top 20. Generally, the top teams played on New Year's Day in the four major postseason bowl games: the Rose Bowl (near Los Angeles at Pasadena), the Sugar Bowl (New Orleans), the Orange Bowl (Miami), and the Cotton Bowl (Dallas).
September.
In the preseason poll released on September 12, 1955, the UCLA Bruins, 1954's co champions, received 33 first place votes, while Oklahoma had 32. Michigan had 34 votes, but the third most points overall. Other teams nominated for the top spot were defending champ Ohio State, Maryland, Notre Dame, Navy, Miami, Georgia Tech, Iowa, USC, Duke, West Virginia, and Purdue. As the regular season progressed, a new poll would be issued on the Monday following the weekend's games. The preseason Top Five was 1.UCLA 2.Oklahoma 3.Michigan 4.Ohio State 5.Maryland.
On Friday, September 16, #1 UCLA opened in Los Angeles with a 21-0 win over visiting Texas A&M. September 17, Oklahoma, Michigan and Ohio State were idle, but #5 Maryland edged Missouri on the road, 13-12. #10 Georgia Tech, which had beaten #9 Miami 14-6 in Atlanta, rose to 2nd place in the next poll: 1.UCLA 2.Georgia Tech 3.Oklahoma 4.Michigan 5.Maryland.
On September 24, #1 UCLA and #5 Maryland met at College Park, before a record crowd. UCLA's Doug Peters plunged into the end zone in the first half, but fumbled the ball before crossing the goal line. In the second half, the home team Terrapins had the ball 17 yards from goal, on fourth down. Rather than kicking a field goal, Ed Vereb ran for the winning touchdown, giving Maryland a 7-0 win.
October.
October 1, 
October 8
October 15 #1 Michigan defeated Northwestern, 14-2. #2 Maryland won at North Carolina, 25-7. #3 Oklahoma beat Kansas 44-6. However, #5 Georgia Tech lost to visiting #17 Auburn 14-12, and #4 Notre Dame lost 21-7 when it hosted #13 Michigan State. They dropped from the top five and were replaced by #8 Navy (which had won 34-14 at Penn State) and #11 Duke (which had won at #14 Ohio State, 20-14). The poll: 1.Michigan 2.Maryland 3.Oklahoma 4.Navy 5.Duke 
October 22 In Minneapolis #1 Michigan faced a 1-3-0 Minnesota team, and was stunned when the Gophers racked up two touchdowns in the first quarter. Michigan's Terry Barr blocked the extra point attempt on the second touchdown, but the nation's #1 team was losing 13-0. Still down 13-7 at the half, the Wolverines fought back. Jim Van Pelt passed to Tom Maentz for a touchdown, and Van Pelt added the extra point to save Michigan, 14-13. Minnesota would go on to a 3-6-0 finish. Meanwhile #2 Maryland won more convincingly at Syracuse, 34-13, to regain the top spot. #3 Oklahoma beat #14 Colorado, 56-21. #4 Navy won at Penn, 33-0. #5 Duke lost to Pitt, 26-7, and was replaced in the top five by #6 Michigan State, which beat Illinois 21-7.
The poll: 1.Maryland 2.Oklahoma 3.Michigan 4.Navy 5.Michigan State
October 29 Back at the top, #1 Maryland beat South Carolina 27-0, while #2 Oklahoma won at Kansas State, 40-7. #3 Michigan beat Iowa 33-21. #4 Navy lost at #9 Notre Dame, 21-7. #5 Michigan State won at Wisconsin, 27-0. UCLA returned to the Top Five from #6
after a 47-0 win over California. 
The poll: 1.Maryland 2.Oklahoma 3.Michigan 4.Michigan State 5.UCLA
November.
November 5 As both stayed undefeated, #1 Maryland beat LSU 13-0 and #2 Oklahoma won at Missouri, 20-0. 
The poll: 1.Oklahoma 2.Maryland 3.Michigan State 4.UCLA 5.Notre Dame
November 12 Back at #1, Oklahoma beat Iowa State 52-0. #2 Maryland won at Clemson, 25-12. #3 Michigan State beat Minnesota 42-14. #4 UCLA was trailing Washington 17-16 in the closing seconds of a game, but Jim Decker kicked a field goal for a 19-17 victory. #5 Notre Dame won at North Carolina, 27-7. The poll: 1.Oklahoma 2.Maryland 3.Michigan State 4.Notre Dame 5.UCLA
November 19 Although #1 Oklahoma was 8-0-0 and host Nebraska was 5-4-0, both had 5-0-0 records in Big 7 conference play when they met at Lincoln. The Sooners rolled, 41-0, to get the Orange Bowl bid. #2 Maryland closed its season with a 19-0 win over George Washington University and accepted the invitation to meet Oklahoma, but what would have been a #1 vs. #2 meeting changed when the Terrapins were rated third by the AP voters. #3 Michigan State, which had a 5-1 record in Big Ten play, beat Marquette 33-0 in a non-conference game; Michigan's 17-0 loss to Ohio State gave it a 5-2 mark. Ohio State had the better record in the Big Ten, 6-0 overall, but had gone to the Rose Bowl the year before, so MSU got the bid, where it would face #5 UCLA, which beat USC 17-7. #4 Notre Dame beat Iowa 17-14. Though Maryland, like Oklahoma, was unbeaten, the voters put once-beaten Michigan State in the second spot instead. The poll: 1.Oklahoma 2.Michigan State 3.Maryland 4.UCLA 5.Notre Dame. On November 26, #5 Notre Dame lost in Los Angeles to USC, 42-20, and dropped to 6th in the final AP poll, where it would be replaced by Ohio State. The other Top Five teams had finished their seasons.
Conference standings.

History of Jews in Opatów

This article documents the history of Jews in Opatów, a town in Poland, located in the historic province of Lesser Poland among the hills of Lesser Polish Upland, with the Opatówka river dividing the town into two parts. Opatów is called Apt/Apta in Yiddish.
The thriving Jewish community dating back for centuries was almost entirely eradicated during the Holocaust with most victims sent to their deaths at Treblinka extermination camp and murdered upon arrival. The Shoah survivors and their descendants have settled mainly in Israel, New York City and Toronto.
Jewish life in 16th century Opatów.
Jews first settled in Opatów in the 16th century, with four Jewish families recorded in the town's documents in 1518. The first "privilege" (a document defining local rights and jurisdiction issues) for Jews in the town was issued by the contemporary owner of the town, Jan Tarnowski in 1545. The first synagogue was most likely build at the end of the 16th century. In the 1630s there is a written mention of a "Jewish street" (or "Jewish Quarter"). This ran from the north part of the city wall to the market square. The Jewish quarter was partially autonomous, and the Jews themselves were responsible for providing local security. With increased migration of Jews from Germany to Poland, the Jewish community of Opatów grew. This was in spite of the mood of the local residents who feared that the Jews would control commerce and skilled crafts. They approached the king of Poland with the request that he put a limit on the number of Jews involved in commerce and crafts, especially in weaving, baking and fur production. The king acceded to their appeal and prohibited the Jews from engaging in these areas. As a result, the town council placed many obstacles before Jewish residents when they attempted to purchase land for a cemetery and when they wanted to build private residences on their street. However, shortly thereafter the restrictions on acquiring land were revoked, and for their part, the Jews agreed to cover some of the town's fiscal expenses. By 1658, the Polish king, Jan Kazimierz, renewed the Jews' unrestricted right to purchase land and to trade in Opatów.
The development of the Jewish community of Opatów ended with the Swedish Wars in the mid 17th century. The Jewish quarter was burned, and what the fire did not destroy, the soldiers plundered. In 1656, Opatów was freed from the Swedes by the soldiers of the Polish Hetman Stefan Czarniecki. With the cessation of the fighting, the king Jan Kazimierz came to the aid of the Jewish community. In an order from 1657, he permitted them to build new houses to replace those destroyed by fire and to trade and maintain stores and butcher shops in the town. Subsequent kings confirmed these rights. 
However, even before the Jews were able to rebuild, other calamities ensued. In 1680, a fire destroyed most of the 'Jews' Street' and this was followed by a plague that claimed many lives. In 1685, a blood libel was circulated that threatened all the Jews in the area. In a village near Opatów, a day-old Gentile infant died, and a rumor was circulated that the Jews killed him. The governor of the district, who was one of those behind the rumor, ordered the arrest of the Jewish innkeeper of the village. The Jews were then compelled to pay the governor a fine of 2,400 złoty payable over a period of three years. This fine subsequently became a permanent required payment.
In the 18th century, and especially during the time where Poland was annexed to Austria (1793–1807) when restrictions on living outside the limits of the 'Jewish Street' were cancelled, the Jewish population greatly increased. Their economic activity expanded to include new and important areas. In addition to retail business, wide ranging trade in grain, lumber, eggs, cattle and agricultural products developed. Some of the Jews controlled the marketing of local crops from the entire area. Some even leased estates and operated them on their own. The end of the 19th century saw the Jews taking an active role in the industrialization of the town. In the 1890s, Jews opened two tanneries and a sugar factory and in the early part of the 20th century a dye-works for area cottage weavers. Even with these developments, the main source of livelihood for the Jews during this time was through petty trading and skilled crafts.
Legal issues for the Jews in Opatów.
During the 16th and 17th centuries, the community of Opatów was a member of the “Country Council” of Greater Poland in the Council of the Four Lands. Delegates from Opatów participated in the meetings of the Council. Some of them were among the appraisers, who were empowered by the Council to assess the tax obligations of each and every Jewish community.
From 1666 to the beginning of the 20th century, the Jews of Opatów maintained a community register (Pinkas) that included all the regulations enacted by the its leadership. Today, the Pinkas is an invaluable source of information for researchers on the history of the community. A copy of the Pinkas was in the archives of the Central Synagogue in Warsaw but was lost during The Holocaust. From the Pinkas we learn of the independence of some of the societies (hevrot) with regards to the official community and of the dependence of the Jewish artisans (tailors and furriers) on the Christian guilds. Thus, the Jewish craftsmen were required to pay membership fees to the guilds, but the guilds specified that they had no obligation to come to their aid. At the head of the Jewish organizations was a committee of eleven men: 3 gabaim, 2 trustees and 5 accountants. The list of expenses in the Pinkas reflects the relationship between the leadership of the community to the nobility and government officials. Also included are the travel expenses of the leaders to the government in Warsaw in their attempts of intercession with the superior authorities. Among the regular expenses are the payments for cantors and singers, for the most part itinerant cantors who came to Opatów for a Sabbath or holiday to conduct services; for visiting preachers, the community had a regular preacher; aid for poor exiles, for those traveling to Israel, funds for the redemption of captives, support of wandering collectors of charity and many more items of this nature.
Jewish institutions in Opatów.
During the 16th century, the first synagogue in Opatów was built and the cemetery was dedicated. Later a number of charitable societies were founded – for visiting the sick, shelter, bridal dowries and a shelter for travelers. In the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century there was a school Talmud Torah funded by the community where most of the Jewish children studied.
Religious leaders from Opatów.
Among the rabbis who served Opatów the following names are most prominent: R. Moshe M”t (the M”t is an acronym for Marbitz Torah – the teacher of Torah) who died in 1606; R. Ya'akov ben R. Elyakim Halpern, died 1645, who lived in Lvov at the end of his life; R. Eliezer Ashkenazi, known as “Ish Zvi,” the author of the volume Dameshek Eliezer, who settled in Eretz Yisrael in 1651. Also included are R. Shmuel ben R. Eliezer, R. Avigdor Kra – d. 1645; R. Yitzhak ben R. Zev Wolf, who because of his sharpness in scholarship was known as “R. Itzik Spitzkop [peaked-head” from 1668 to 1674, who moved to Kraków where he died in 1682; R. Shmuel ben R. Heschel, d. 1707, the rabbi of the Kraków district. In 1701, he relocated to Kraków to serve as its rabbi, but he continued to hold that position in Opatów until 1705 when he moved to Breslau. R. Meir ben R. Binyamin Wolf Halpern, who came to Opatów from Chełm. In 1718, he represented Opatów at the Council of the Four Lands, d. 1723. During his time, R. Tzvi Hirsch Ashkenazi, the Haham Tzvi, lived in Opatów; R. Yitzhak Segal Landa, a native of Opatów, served as rabbi from 1719, d. 1767; R. Aharon Moshe Ya'akov of Kraków, from 1730, his approbations from Opatów date from 1732; R. Shaul ben R. Simha Halevi from 1768; R. Hanania Lipa Meizlis, from 1772, d. 1816; R. Arieh Leibush Harif from about 1790.
Opatów was the birthplace of the preacher (Magid) R. Yisrael of Kozhnitz (Yisroel Hopsztajn) known as the Koznitzer Maggid, one of the four founders of Hasidism in Poland. Towards the end of the 18th century, the Admor title used for head of Hasidic group – “our master, our teacher, our rabbi” Rabbi Moshe Leib of Sasov settled in Opatów. He established a Hasidic center, one of the most important in Poland. Many Hasidim streamed to his court and some of them settled permanently in Opatów to be near their rabbi, and the community continuously grew. 
The presence of the Hasidim increased the need for goods and services in the town. Many Jews now made a living by providing lodging and food for the masses of Hasidim who visited the Admor on weekdays, and especially on the Sabbath and holidays. The visitors also purchased merchandise in town and from time to time needed the services of the local skilled artisans.
The Hasidic master (Admor) R. Aharon Hacohen, author of Keter Shem Tov (The Crown of a Good Name) about the Baal Shem Tov (Besht), printed in 1795, also made his home in Opatów. The most famous of the Hasidic leaders who lived in Opatów for a time was R. Ya'akov Yitzchok, “The Holy Jew from Przhysha,” 1813. In the beginning of the 19th century, Rabbi Avrohom Yehoshua Heshl, 'the Apter Rov,' served as Admor and rabbi of the town. The author of "Oheiv Yisrael" (Lover of Israel), he, as well as “The Holy Jew,” were disciples of R. Arieh Leibush 1811, known as “The Grandfather (Zaida) of Spola”. After he left Opatów, R. Meir Rotenberg (d. 1827), author of Or Lashamayim (Light to Heaven), was elected as rabbi. He stood at the head of the Hasidic masters (Admorim) who opposed the approach of “The Holy Jew.” R. Shmuel Eibeszuc (d. 1884), author of Toras Shmuel (The Doctrine of Shmuel) who was also a Hasid, was chosen as rabbi of Opatów. The Admor of Opatów during his time was the son of R. Meir, R. Pinhas Rotenberg (d. 1837). The dynasty in Opatów continued with his son, R. Meir ben R. Pinhas Rotenberg.
R. Pinhas ben R. Meir was succeeded in the rabbinate of Opatów by R. Ya'akov, the grandson of R. David of Lelov, who was also a Hasidic master; his grandson, R. Arieh Leibush Lipshitz, who settled in Israel and R. Tzvi Arieh in 1909.
For many years, the head of the rabbinic court was R. Eliezer Yehoshua Epstein, who subsequently moved to Rakov and Chmielnik.
Parts of the Apta Hasidic dynasty continued in the United States and Canada.
Jewish cultural leaders from Opatów.
Opatów was the birthplace of the Hebrew poet Natan Nota Shapira (1817–1897). Also making their residence there in the last quarter of the 19th century, were the poet and author, Isaac Leib Peretz (1852–1915) and his father-in-law, the maskil and mathematician, Gabriel Yehuda Lichtenfeld (1811–1887). He published articles in the Hebrew newspapers Hashahar and Hatzfira and also authored a mathematics textbook.
The twentieth century for Jews in Opatów.
The years of the Austrian occupation (1915–1918) were a period of revitalization for the Jews of Opatów. The new rulers openly permitted political parties, forbidden during Tsarist rule, to function. The branch of the Opatów Bund, which had operated underground, opened it own active club, "Zukumpft" (the Future). It became a center of many activities, including a drama club. However, the main focus of the town was Zionist activity, whose origins predated the war. During the war, a Hebrew kindergarten was opened. It closed in 1921 because of a lack of financing. A branch of "Tzieri Zion" (Youth of Zion) was founded in 1918. Among the activities of its members was collecting food and fuel for the needy. 
The rising tide of Anti-Semitism in Poland did not bypass Opatów. Towards the end of the war, Polish soldiers under the command of General Haller passed through the town attacking Jews and plundering their possessions.
The Jews in Opatów between the two World Wars.
During the 1920s and 1930s, Opatów was noted for the manufacture of brushes, which were famous throughout Poland. Most of the enterprises and workshops in the town were in Jewish hands. According to a partial census by the Joint from 1921, Opatów had 229 Jewish enterprises and workshops. More than half, 146 were in the area of clothing, 33 were involved with food, and 18 dealt with leather and other items. Most employed their owners and their families. Factories operated by non-Jews did not hire Jews, and the local flour mill, although owned by Jews (the Grynspan family), employed few of them.
The main occupation of the town's Jews remained as it was in the past, small trade. Jews purchased the produce from area farmers and in exchange sold them manufactured goods. Some Jews were involved in transporting people to and from the train station that was outside the town. Most of the Jews had difficulty making a living. Very few, with the exception of those who had leased large areas of forests for lumber, were well off.
In 1925, the organization of merchants and small workshops in Opatów organized a Jewish cooperative bank. Three years later, the merchants withdrew and founded their own bank. The two banks, one of the merchants and the other of the small workshops, existed until the outbreak of World War II. Opatów also had a gemach (free-loan fund) that offered interest-free loans to the needy. Also helping the poor were the traditional charitable societies for visiting the sick, provision of lodging for the needy and travelers and dowering brides. In 1930 a small hospital and a branch of the organization Ezra, which helped the poorest, were established.
During the interwar period, many of the community's children studied in the Talmud Torah that moved to a new building in 1929. A Yeshiva that functioned for five years was founded in the early 1930s. In 1923, the government opened an elementary school for Jewish children – "Shabesukvah", where mostly girls studied. In 1933, it became a regular school with sessions on the Sabbath where Poles and Jews studied together. In 1925 a school sponsored by the Beth Jacob network opened for the girls of Opatów and a heder Yesodei Hatorah, under the supervision of Agudath Israel, opened for boys. The Tarbut school, where instruction was in Hebrew, opened in 1934 and each year another grade was added. It also occupied its own building.
The majority of Opatów's Jews were Orthodox and they controlled the community and its institutions. A branch of Agudath Israel started in 1921. Even so, there were active chapters of most of the Zionist political parties in Opatów. In the early 1920s, a branch of “Hehalutz” started and its members started an agricultural pioneer training center in a nearby farm. A branch of Hashomer Hatzioni (the Zionist Guard), later known as Hanoar Hatzioni [(Zionist Youth) started in 1927 and in the early 1930s, a branch of the Revisionists was founded. The Zionist parties and youth movements were also involved in cultural activities and opened courses for Hebrew and conducted lectures on a wide range of topics. The average number of those purchasing the Shekel in Opatów was 300. The strength of the various Zionist parties in Opatów can be seen from the voting results for the Zionist congresses. In 1921, Mizrahi received 159 votes, Al Hamishmar received 110 votes and Hitachdut received 91. In the 1929 elections, Mizrahi received 272, Al Hamishmar received 99, Eit Livnot received 91 and Poalei Zion received 18. In 1939, the last election before the war, Mizrahi received 159, Al Hamishmar received 110, The Working Eretz Yisrael list received 91 and the General Zionists 33. There was a small branch of the Bund and a number of Jews were active in the Communist underground.
The results of the last elections for the community council were, 5 representatives of Agudath Israel, 3 Zionists, 2 craftsmen, and one representative from an independent list. The Jews of Opatów also had representation in local government. In the first elections for the municipal council in 1919, they received 19 of the 24 seats on the council; in 1927 and 1931, only 11 Jews were elected.
In 1920, Opatów's rabbi was R. Hayim Yosef Ba”ch, who signed an edict prohibiting the purchase of rabbinic positions. In 1930, after a bitter struggle, R. Shalom Rokeah (the son of the Admor of Belz R. Yisachar Dov Rokeah Belzer Rebbe) was elected rabbi. He was the last rabbi of Opatów and perished in the Holocaust. The Belz Hasidim had their own prayer house. Besides that one, there were shtiblach rooms of the Gur, Ostrovitze, Modzitz and Alexander Hasidim.
In the 1930s, there was constant anti-Semitic agitation in Opatów and in 1936 there were attacks against the Jews. On one of the market days, a group of hoodlums along with area farmers, attacked stores and stalls of Jews. They stole goods, attacked the owners and their families, tried to break into houses and injured 30 Jews. The police arrested 20 of the rioters and they were brought to trial. Thirteen of them were sentenced to short terms and the rest were freed. The Appeals Court upheld the convictions but set aside the sentences of six of them because of their age.
Opatów Jews in World War II and The Holocaust.
On the eve of World War II, Opatów had a Jewish population of 5,200. Many of them, especially the young, fled with the outbreak of the war to the eastern portion of Poland that was captured by the Soviet Union. As soon as the city was taken, the Germans burned the market square with the surrounding houses, most of them inhabited by Jews. The next day, in the local movie theater, they held between 1000 and 1500 Jews and Poles captive for two days under heavy guard and without water or food. The Jews were separated from the Poles and became objects of sadistic treatment on the grounds that they concealed weapons and planned to flee the city without first receiving permission to leave. After they were finally released to their homes, the German gendarmes seized 200 young Jews and under the heavy guard of the SS took them to an unknown place from which they did not return.
German occupation of Opatów.
At the end of 1939, all Jews living in large and fine houses were ordered to evacuate them and move to the Jewish quarter, one of the poorest sections of the town. The deserted Jewish homes were then taken over by German officers.
At the beginning of 1940 the Germans posted special orders for the Jews – the requirement to wear a white armband with a blue Star of David, the prohibition of buying from or selling to non-Jews, and in addition to this they were forced to make large payments. The first payment was for 60,000 Marks with the addition of jewelry and other items of value to be handed over to the Germans within 24 hours. By the beginning of 1941, the Germans had confiscated all the Jewish owned enterprises.
The Jews were required to establish a Judenrat in the beginning of 1940. At its head was M. Weissblum, a wealthy man acceptable to the entire community. The Judenrat was forced to obey all the orders of the German rulers and to fulfill all their demands. Even with all of this, Weissblum and his colleagues the Judenrat sought to defend the interests of the Jews and from time to time were able to pay ransom to release Jews whom the Germans would periodically arrest. The Judenrat also used bribes to help relieve the plight of the Jews.
Opatów Ghetto.
A ghetto was established in Opatów in the spring of 1941, and the entire way of life of the town changed. As was stated, before the ghetto was established the Germans had succeeded in confiscating all of the Jewish businesses and remove them from any possibility of making a living. A station of the SD, which brought terror and fear to the Jews, was set up in Opatów. The ghetto occupied Berko Yoslevitz St. and some alleyways in the area. Besides the local Jews, refugees from Warsaw and Łódź arrived. They came on their own believing that there would be more of a chance to survive the Nazi occupation in small towns. As a result of the terrible crowding and unspeakable sanitary conditions, there was an outbreak of typhus in the ghetto, especially among the refugees whose living conditions were the worst. The Judenrat and other self-help groups organized to fight the typhus plague. An infirmary operated by TA”Z (the Jewish health organization of Poland) and a hospital of 30-40 beds operated in the ghetto. A public soup kitchen provided lunches for a symbolic price for the needy, and another opened shortly thereafter. These two kitchens continued operating until the liquidation of the Opatów ghetto in October 1942.
The ghetto residents attempted to maintain an orderly pattern of life, including a school system for the children, vocational training, aid and social services. At the beginning, the Judenrat, with the help of knowledgeable and enterprising Jews, set up workshops to produce brushes. They hoped to keep as many people gainfully employed as only those with a regular job and a work permit qualified ghetto residents to receive a daily bread ration. The Judenrat also tried to convince the Germans to permit them to open a school for small children in the ghetto. In the end, a permit was issued and on 16 July 1941, a school comprising six grades and 220 children opened with instruction in Hebrew and Yiddish. The ghetto also had a Torah study group in the Beit Midrash of Ohev Yisrael. There was an agriculture pioneer training farm of the Freiheit (Dror) and Hashomer Hatzair youth groups near Opatów. They worked under the direction of the landowners and their leader was Kalman Tchernichovsky.
Initially, the Germans were satisfied with the Judenrat providing them with forced laborers and did not snatch people from the streets as they did in other places. Every day the Judenrat supplied them with 50 to 60 house workers for their domestic needs. However, the setting up of the Opatów ghetto in the spring of 1941 undermined the previous arrangement. Periodically, representatives of the Todt Company would enter the ghetto and seize hundreds of people for forced labor. The first group of young people was sent to work camps in the Lublin region. The prisoners of these camps suffered from hunger, beatings and abuse from the Ukrainians and German gendarmes. Many died of hunger or disease and there were some suicides. The Judenrat attempted to send them food packages. A short while later, the Todt Company demanded that the Judenrat supply it with 500 additional young people and threatened to have the ghetto liquidated if they did not comply. The new workers, men and women, reported on time and were sent to the notorious work camp Skarsyzko Kamienna (cf.). Shortly thereafter, another group of 200 men were taken from the ghetto to work in the munitions factory in the Starachowitze labor camp. Next came the turn of the agriculture pioneer training farm. One day the Germans entered and took a large group of young people along with their leader, Kalman Tchernichovsky. They were also sent to Skarsyzko Kamienna. Before being sent away, Tchernichovsky managed to make contact with the pioneer farm that was in Ostrowiec (cf.) near Opatów. He continued his work even in the forced labor camp. In 1941, Mordecai Anielewicz visited Skarsyzko Kamienna and met with Tchernichovsky and his colleagues. Yitzhak Zuckerman (Antek) also visited the members of the Opatów underground.
In the beginning of 1942, a group of Jews expelled from Silesia arrived in Opatów's ghetto. The number of residents, which had decreased because of the abductions to the forced labor camps, multiplied. At the same time, those young people who still remained in the ghetto began to organize as an underground. They even obtained some weapons that were kept in a hiding place. Meanwhile, the seizures for forced labor increased, this time by the members of the SD and the Gestapo. Those abducted were also sent to Skarzysko Kamienna and Starachowitze. At this point in time, the number of those escaping to the forests and to the Aryan side of the city grew. The ghetto's youth underground also increased its activity especially in obtaining weapons from area Poles. They maintained close contact with the Polish underground in Ostrowiec and through them met additional arms dealers. It was mostly the women who took care of hiding the weapons. On one of the winter days of 1942, the SD along with the Gestapo raided the arms repository. Immediately afterward, the enraged Germans began searching all the Jewish homes. They interrogated the ghetto inhabitants, randomly shot passersby and threatened the lives of the Judenrat. Everyone knew that its discovery was the work of an informer, but it is not known who it was.
Liquidation of the Opatów Ghetto.
Between October 20 and 22, 1942, the ghetto of Opatów was liquidated. Members of the German gendarmerie and Ukrainian police surrounded the ghetto, assembled all the residents in the large sports field and carried out a 'selection.' Some 500 people that were found fit for work were sent to a forced labor camp in Sandomierz (cf.). A smaller group of a few dozen Jews, including the members of the Judenrat and the Jewish police, were returned to the ghetto under armed guard. The remainder of the ghetto population, some 6,000 in number, was taken to the train station in nearby Yashitze (Jasice), where they were jammed into trains and sent to the death camp Treblinka where they were murdered en masse upon arrival.
The Jews who were returned to the ghetto were required to gather and inventory the abandoned possessions of those who were deported and forced to clean the deserted area. On the completion of these tasks, they were taken to the cemetery where they were murdered. 
By the summer of 1944, there were still some 1,500 young Jews from Opatów in the various forced labor camps – Skarżysko Kamienna, Starachowice, Radom, Auschwitz subcamp in Ostrowiec and others. Most worked in munitions factories and other units producing matériel for the Germans. These camps were surrounded by barbed wire and the Jewish forced laborers were brutally treated by the Ukrainian guards. Beatings were a daily occurrence; food was scarce and of poor quality and even water was meagerly distributed. Periodically, the sick and weak were separated, brought to the nearby forest and shot. With the approach of the Red Army to the area, the Germans killed those healthy prisoners who still remained in the camps.
Descendants of the Opatów Jews.
There were 300 Holocaust survivors from Apt, most of whom were from among the forced laborers. The survivors from Opatów and their descendants have settled mainly in Israel, New York City and Toronto where active community groups of survivors and their families were formed and flourished. The 11th of Cheshvan (October 22, 1942 in the Hebrew calendar) is a date in which the descendants of the Jews of Opatów gather to remember the loss and murder of their ancestors.

USS Rockaway (AVP-29)

USS "Rockaway" (AVP-29/AG-123) was a United States Navy "Barnegat"-class seaplane tender in commission from 1943 to 1946. She served in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean during World War II. In 1948, she was loaned to the United States Coast Guard, in which she served as USCGC "Rockaway" (WAVP-377), later WAGO-377, WHEC-377, and WOLE-377, from 1949 to 1972. 
Construction and commissioning.
"Rockaway" was laid down on 30 June 1941 by Associated Shipbuilders, Inc., at Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 14 February 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Z. E. Briggs, and commissioned on 6 January 1943 with Commander H. C. Doan in command.
World War II service.
Following shakedown, the seaplane tender "Rockaway" became a unit of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, with home base at Norfolk, Virginia, in April 1943.
Transatlantic voyages and North African service.
From April 1943 until October 1944, "Rockaway" delivered supplies and personnel to outlying bases in the North Atlantic Ocean. She transferred a complete seaplane squadron from Newfoundland to England, carried aviation cargo from Norfolk, Virginia to the aircraft carrier USS "Ranger" (CV-4) at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, delivered secret radar equipment to England to be used in the Normandy invasion of 6 June 1944, performed guard duty at Casablanca, French Morocco, for two months, and transported aircraft engines to the Azores
"Rockaway" completed nine round trips across the Atlantic during this interval, steaming independently. On several occasions, she made submarine contacts and dropped depth charges, but with undetermined results.
Invasion of France.
During the invasion of France in June 1944, "Rockaway" performed sundry duties for 20 days - patrol and convoy work in the English Channel, flagship duty for Admiral J. Wilkes, USN, transportation of United States Army and U.S. Navy personnel, and protection of Allied beachheads against German air attacks.
Operations from the Panama Canal Zone.
After a navy yard period in November 1944, "Rockaway" was based in the Panama Canal Zone, completing two trips to the Galapagos Islands with aviation supplies and personnel. In December 1944 she rescued 13 survivors from a Martin PBM Mariner flying boat which had crashed off Coco Solo, Panama.
Operations in Brazil.
On 21 February 1945, "Rockaway", while steaming to Recife, Brazil, located and guarded a disabled tanker for three days until a fleet tug arrived on the scene to tow the tanker.
"Rockaway" operated in Brazil from February 1945 to July 1945, supplying the various naval bases from Belém to Bahia, Brazil, with men and equipment.
Conversion to press information ship begun.
In July 1945, "Rockaway" began conversion at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, into a press information ship. Reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary and redesignated AG-123 on 30 July 1945, her conversion was designed to allow her to carry 50 correspondents during the invasion of Japan, which was scheduled for 1945-1946. After hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945 before an invasion could occur, she was reconverted into a seaplane tender.
Honors and awards.
Rockaway earned one battle star for her World War II service.
Post-World War II U.S. Navy service and inactivation.
"Rockaway" sailed from Boston on 26 October 1945. She reported to the Inactive Fleet at Orange, Texas, on 12 November 1945. Decommissioned there on 21 March 1946, "Rockaway" was placed in reserve and berthed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange.
United States Coast Guard service.
The U.S. Navy loaned "Rockaway" to the United States Coast Guard on 24 December 1948, which commissioned her as Coast Guard cutter USCGC "Rockaway" (WAVP-377) in 1949, and permanently transferred her to the Coast Guard in 1966. While operating with the Coast Guard, "Rockaway" performed a variety of tasks. Her primary duty until 1965 was to patrol ocean stations in the Atlantic Ocean to provide weather reporting services and engage in search-and-rescue and law-enforcement operations. In 1965 she became an "oceanographic vessel", redesignated WAGO-377, and her focus shifted to oceanographic survey work. She became a high endurance cutter, WHEC-377, in 1966, and an "offshire law-enforcement vessel," WOLE-377, in 1971. She was sold for scrapping in 1972.

Chile-Mexico relations

Chilean-Mexican relations refers to the diplomatic relations between the Republic of Chile and the United Mexican States; two Latin American countries with emerging economies.
Diplomatic relations.
Chile and Mexico both share a common history in that they were both hosts to advanced indigenous societies and were both colonized by Spain. Diplomatic relations were established in the 1820s soon after both nations obtained independence from Spain. Chile soon opened a consulate in Mexico City and in Mazatlán and Mexico opened a consulate in Valparaíso. In the early 1900s, both nations established resident embassies in each other's capitals respectively.
In 1914, Chile belonged to regional group called the ABC nations (which included Argentina, Brazil and Chile). These three nations made up the richest and most influential nations in South America at the time. That year, the ABC nations intervened in a diplomatic dispute between the United States and Mexico who were on verge of war over the Tampico Affair and the subsequent occupation of Veracruz by US forces. The ABC nations meet with representatives of the United States and Mexico in Niagara Falls, Canada to ease the tension between the two nations and to avoid war, which afterwards did not occur.
On 11 November 1974, then-Mexican President Luis Echeverría Álvarez severed diplomatic relations with Chile a year after the unconstitutional removal and death of elected President Salvador Allende by General Augusto Pinochet. For the next fifteen years, Mexico would receive thousands of Chilean refugees who were fleeing the government of Pinochet. Both nations re-established diplomatic relations on 23 March 1990.
Since the re-establishment of diplomatic relations, both nations have increasingly become closer with regards to bilateral relations and trade. Chile and Mexico are the only two Latin-American countries who are members of the OECD. In June 2012, both nations are founding members of the Pacific Alliance trading bloc along with Colombia and Peru; which aims to increase trade with nations of the Pacific rim. Both nations are also mutual members of the United Nations, Organization of American States and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.
Trade.
Trade between the two nations has been steadily increasing over the years. Both nations signed a free trade agreement in 1999. Since the implementation of the free trade agreement, trade between the two nations amount to approximately $3 billion USD with 99.7% of trade being tariff free.

The Moran Bay Patrol Cabin was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps about 1932. The log structure was located in the northern backcountry of Grand Teton National Park, and was built to a standard design for such structures, in the National Park Service Rustic style, but for the U.S. Forest Service, which administered much of the area prior to the expansion of the park in 1943. The Upper Granite Canyon Patrol Cabin is similar.
The cabin was a day's hike from the Leigh Lake Ranger Patrol Cabin to the south and the Colter Canyon cabin to the north. Located in a remote portion of the park, the cabin was used for winter ranger patrols. The one story cabin was built on a stone foundation. The log walls were saddle-notched at the corners. The roof was sheathed with cedar shingles and had exposed log purlin structure on the interior, which is a single room. The site features a view of Jackson Lake's Moran Bay, and is at present usually accessed by boat from the lake. The cabin was reconstructed in 1995, and destroyed in a forest fire in 2000. 
The Moran Bay Patrol Cabin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1998

Halwai

The Halwai are the traditional sweet makers, who sometimes form a community, found in India and Pakistan. The Arabic word "Halwa" means "sweet" and "Halvai" or "Halwai" means sweet-maker. They are also known as Mithaya in Madhya Pradesh, Gudia in Orissa, Mayara in West Bengal and other names in other regions. 
Some Halwai belong to a caste of confectioners and sweet-makers, found mainly in North India. The name is derived from the word halwa, a popular sweet made of flour, clarified butter (ghee), sugar, almonds, raisins and pistachio nuts and also frequently saffron. They sell:
What they sell is sometimes termed mishtanna, or sweetened grain based items).
Traditionally Indians ate food cooked inside their own homes, although food cooked with ghee/oil by halwais was considered to be an acceptable exception.
Since sweets are given to children and are offered to Gods during worship, purity of sweets is considered to be an important attribute.
Origins of the Halwai Caste.
The Halwai give no specific mythological account of the origins of their community. The Madhya Pradesh Halwais migrated from north-western India - Rajasthan during the medieval period. They are traditional vaishyas who were involved in Business and agriculture. They enjoy high status in the society as they belong to Vaishya community i.e. third in varna system. Only Brahmins and Rajput (Kshatriya) enjoys higher status than them. They are considered as "Dwija" i.e. twice born and hence enjoys the right of "Upanayana sanskar".
In Uttar Pradesh, tradition has it that they are descended from a man by the name 'Bhalandan.' This Bhalandan came into being due to the will of the Hindu god Brahma. This individual married a woman named Marutwati. Their son was an individual who was named Vatsa Priti. One of the latter's descendents, an individual called Modan, took to making sweetmeats.
The community is split into nine sub-groups, the Modanseni, Kanyakubja, Yagyaseni, Jaunpuri, Badshahi, Kanbo, Kaithiya, Nagri and Rawatputra. The Modanseni consider themselves superior to the other clans. Like other North Indian Hindu castes, they maintain gotra exogamy. To a substantial extent, the community belongs to the Vaishnava sect of Hinduism, although some members of the community have converted to Islam, and now form a separate community known as the Muslim Halwai.
The community was among the earliest to set up its own caste association, the Kanyakubja Vaishya Halwai Mahasabha, which was established in Varanasi in the year 1903.
The Halwai is held in respect socially as their services are of social and ritualistic significance. Generally speaking, no Indian caste, not even the Brahman/Brahmin (the highest Hindu priestly caste) considers itself too pure to eat what has been prepared by a Halwai. Considering that sweets are of special importance to religious rituals and social events, this community plays a very specific, well-defined role in all festivals and celebrations such as marriages and childbirths.
Distribution.
The Halwai are known by different names in different states. They are referred to as Mithaiha (meaning sweet) in Madhya Pradesh many of them belong to the Agarwal community. In Bihar, they are called Madhesia and Kanu Vaisya and go by last names such as Sah, Madhesiya, Saw and Gupta. In Uttar Pradesh they are known as Yogyaseni, Modanwal, Halwai, and Gupta. In Orissa, the Halwai are known as Gudia (jaggery), whilst in West Bengal they are called Mayara, meaning confectioner.
There are large numbers living in the fertile eastern districts of Barabanki and Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh. They trace the origin of the term from the Hindi halwahi, or "one who ploughs".
Modernization.
Recently some of the Halwais have adopted modern manufacturing approaches and produce packaged sweets in large quantities, some of which are exported to other countries. They have often chosen to keep old-fashioned names from previous generations like Ghasitaram, Haldiram, Chandu etc.
Nowadays some Halwai prefer to tell themselves by the surname of SHAH.

Helsinki Swimming Stadium

Helsinki Swimming Stadium is an outdoors swimming venue in Helsinki, Finland, located in the Eläintarha area to the northeast of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium.
History.
The Swimming Stadium was designed by architect Jorma Järvi in the Functionalist style prevalent during the 1930s. The swimming pool was built for the 1940 Olympic Games, which were then cancelled due to the Second World War; but then hosted the 1952 Summer Olympics.
Because of the war, the construction of the Swimming Stadium took a long time, and it was finally completed in 1947. In wartime, the finished pools were used to store herring and root vegetables.
According to the International Swimming Federation, the water temperature in the pool needs to be at least 22 °C, nowadays 27 °C. The machinery to heat the outdoor pool was ordered from abroad, and the ship transporting them was sunk immediately after the war broke out.
Current use.
The Swimming Stadium is a popular refreshment place for citizens. It is open from the beginning of May to the end of September. It is a popular place, and in summertime it is visited by about 5000 swimmers every day. The Stadium has three pools: a 50 metre exercise swimming pool, a jumping pool and a children's pool, and a small, shallow, round wading pool for small children a little further away. The jumping pool has two 1 metre and two 3 metre high springboards, and a 1 metre plateau in front of the jumping tower. Use of the jumping tower is controlled and requires lifeguard supervision. The 1 and 3 metre springboards are almost always freely usable by customers. However, for example when swimming teams or clubs come to practice at the Stadium, the 3 metre springboard may be reserved for their use.
The area also has a water slide, a gym, a basketball field, a volleyball field, a table tennis table and a café. The gym is open all year round.
Outside normal opening times, the Stadium is used a practicing place for other aquatic sports, for example diving schools use the jumping pool as practice place.
The Swimming Stadium is also the scene for filming the popular Finnish TV Show Summeri.
In January 2009, the city of Helsinki initiated a discussion of keeping the Helsinki Swimming Stadium heated throughout the entire autumn and winter, in order to make it accessible for outdoor swimming during the entire year, in honour of the 90th anniversary of the Sports Bureau of Helsinki. However, this idea was abandoned as too expensive.

<doc id="18853321" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18853321" title="Exit row">
Exit row

An exit row is a row of seats on board a commercial airliner that is next to an emergency exit. Exit rows may be next to overwing exits or full-sized exit doors.
Passenger criteria.
Since passengers seated in an exit row must be able and willing to assist the crew during an evacuation of the aircraft, civil aviation boards and national governments set specific requirements for passengers seated in an exit row. While exact requirements vary by country and airline, frequently exit row passengers must:
Several US carriers (including American Airlines and US Airways) require passengers with an exit row seat assignment to check in with an agent (as opposed to online or at a kiosk), who will manually verify eligibility and issue a boarding pass.
Comfort and Premium Factor.
Most exit row seats provide a few more inches of seat pitch compared to non-exit row seats so that passengers have more space to access the exit. Seats in front of an exit row may not be able to recline, which can limit their comfort on longer flights. Nonetheless, airlines have taken advantage of this extra space by reserving exit row seats for frequent fliers or charging fees for booking them. A few airlines have gone to branding exit row seats as a premium economy product - on Virgin America's A320, the exit rows (as well as bulkhead seats) are considered "Main Cabin Select" where meals, alcohol, pay-per-view movies and a higher baggage allowance are all included. Main Cabin Select is sold as a separate class of service between coach and first class, and a restrictive MCS fare tends to be equivalent to a full-fare economy ticket. Similarly, JetBlue uses the exit rows as part of their "Even More Space" section.
Hazards.
A few hazards and problems exist with exit row seating. Passengers are typically required to operate "self help" or overwing exits in an emergency. This leads to problems because many passengers don't pay attention to the exit row briefing provided by flight attendants before each flight and don't read the aircraft safety card.
Kinds of Exit Rows.
Typically, there are two kinds of exit rows in which passengers may be seated. There is the exit row next to overwing exits which are typically not attended to by flight attendants and require passengers to operate them in the event of an emergency. The second type of exit row is next to a full-sized exit door and a flight attendant is seated in these rows. The flight attendant typically sits on a jumpseat.

National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience

The National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience (NAYLE) is offered originally by the Philmont Training Center of the Boy Scouts of America and is now offered as reigonal courses. It is a week-long, high-adventure, backcountry leadership development experience for boys and girls 14–20 years old. This training is an element of the Youth Leadership Training Continuum.
Program content.
NAYLE is intended for graduates of National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT). It includes more experiences in team building and ethical decision making. The wilderness-based, challenging program based at Rayado Leadership Mesa and now regional camps such as Onteora Scout Reservation in Livingston Manor, NY, incorporates some portions of the Philmont Ranger Training and advanced search and rescue training as a means to teach leadership, teamwork and servant leadership. This training is an element of the overall leadership training program.
NAYLE replaces the National Youth Leader Instructor Camp (NYLIC), which itself replaced the previous National Junior Leader Instructor Camp (NJLIC). Unlike NYLIC, NAYLE is not intended to specifically train youth staff for local NYLT courses.
Program goals.
The program promises a number of subjective outcomes focusing on an individual's perspective, opinion, and feelings, including "growing self-awareness, growing self-confidence, growing creativity, the happiness from helping others succeed, understanding that everyone is a leader, everyone in the group contributes in a significant way to team success, knowing leadership is a way of life."
The program's goals are to:
NAYLE is designed to equip participants with the skills to return to their local council and serve as staff on their local NYLT course, as summer camp staff, and as better troop leaders. NAYLE is designed to teach participants servant leadership skills in Scouting and for later life so they can "lead for the good of others."
Program activities.
During the week-long backcountry experience, participants are challenged with various activities linked to the skills of leadership defined in NYLT:
Requirements.
Requirements for attending the program have been loosened since 2008. Attendees formerly had to be approved by their Council Executive, and now must meet only these qualifications:
In 2010, program attendance was opened to females. A NYLT to NAYLE bridge course will be available during the first quarter of 2010 for Venturing youth who have not been able to take NYLT. Venture crew members must take either NYLT or a new “Bridge course” to help Venture Crew members who have not yet attended NYLT.
The cost of the program in 2012 is $355, up from was $285 in 2008. With the added cost of traveling to the course location at Philmont Training Center, and given that only six sessions are offered in 2012, attendance is necessarily restricted to at most a few hundred youth out of the many thousands who previously completed National Youth Leadership Training.

Vachaspati (raga)

Vachaspati (pronounced Vāchaspati, meaning "Lord of speech") is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 64th "melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is known as Bhushāvati according to the Muthuswami Dikshitar school. It was borrowed into Hindustani music, like many other Carnatic rāgams.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 4th rāgam in the 11th "chakra Rudra". The mnemonic name is "Rudra-Bhu". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ri gu mi pa dhi ni". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
This scales uses the notes "chathusruthi rishabham, antara gandharam, prati madhyamam, chathusruthi dhaivatham" and "kaisiki nishadham". It is a "sampoorna" rāgam - a rāgam that has all seven "swaras" (notes). It is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of "Harikambhoji", which is the 28th "melakarta" scale.
"Janya" rāgams.
It has many "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it, out of which "Bhooshavali" and "Saraswathi" are popular. See List of "janya" rāgams for all scales associated with "Vachaspati".
Popular compositions.
"Vachaspati" is close to "Kalyani" (which is 65th "melakarta") and differs only in the "nishādham". Still, this rāgam does not have many compositions. At the same time many composers have used this rāgam for composing 1 song each.
Popular compositions in this rāgam are
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Vachaspati's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 3 other major "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Charukesi", "Gourimanohari" and "Natakapriya". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the Shadjam to the next note in the rāgam. For further details and an illustration refer "Graha bhedam of Vachaspati".

Mohamed Lamine Debaghine

Dr. Mohamed Lamine Debaghine (born January 24, 1917 in Hussein Dey, Algeria -- died January 23, 2003 in Algiers, Algeria) was an Algerian politician and independence activist.
Mohamed Lamine Debaghine, holding a doctorate of medicine from Algiers University, opened a medical practice in the eastern Constantine region in 1944. At the time, Algeria was a governorate of France, but with the exception of European settlers, Algerians were not accorded civil rights. He quickly became active in politics, and joined Messali Hadj's Parti du peuple algérien (PPA) leftist nationalist movement in 1939. During the Second World War, he was arrested by colonial authorities for nationalist agitation and for inciting Algerian conscripts to refuse military service in the French army (while also condemning Nazism). He emerged as one of the group's most important leaders, pushing for confrontation with the colonial authorities and demanding independence (as opposed to the more moderate followers of Ferhat Abbas, who, unlike the PPA, restricted their demands to full citizenship for Algerian Muslims and autonomous rule).
In 1946, Lamine Debaghine was elected to the French parliament as a deputy of Constantine on a list backed by the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties, a successor movement to the banned PPA. In parliament, he called for Algeria's independence and described France's annexation of the country in 1830 an "aggression", but otherwise stayed out of most parliamentary debates and votes (an exception being to vote against French membership in NATO in 1949).
In 1951, his parliamentary mandate ended, and three years later, an armed rebellion for Algeria's independence erupted led by the Front de libération nationale (FLN), a PPA/MTLD splinter group. In 1956, Lamine Debaghine was made a member of the FLN's exterior delegation (i.e. outside the country) and its shadow parliament, the CNRA, later CCE. Lamine Debaghine was elected minister of foreign affairs in the first lineup of the FLN's government-in-exile, GPRA, under Ferhat Abbas's presidency, holding the post for the period 1958-1960. In this role, he served as a primary spokesman of the FLN to the outside world, and worked to build alliances with the newly independent countries of the Arab world and other regions. However, being outside the country, he had limited authority over the actual armed rebellion of the FLN's armed wing, the Armée de libération nationale (ALN). A Time Magazine article from 1957 described him as Abbas's close collaborator, "Dr. Mohammed Lamine-Debaghine, 40, bitterly anti-French veteran nationalist who is subject to bouts of depression caused by attacks of neuralgia that partially paralyze his face." As an ally of Abane Ramdane, he was later sidelined by Ramdane's rivals, including Ahmed Ben Bella and others, and he was excluded from the GPRA's two following ministerial lineups, as well as from any important role in post-independence politics.
Following the war, he reopened a medical practice in Sétif. He died in Algiers, the Algerian capital, in 2003, at the age of 86.

Cream Cutie

Cream Cutie was a brand of cream liqueur produced and sold in Scotland. Its flavour was described as being cream chocolate and orange and was sold in single serving 187ml bottles. It was available in all branches of Asda across Scotland as well as a number of smaller shops. Additional variations, named Fruity Cutie and Choc Vanilla, were later added with the flavour strawberries and cream and chocolate and vanilla.
Appearance on Dragons' Den.
The brand came to wider public attention after its creator, Anne Hempstock, appeared on the BBC show Dragons' Den seeking investment in the brand. The Dragons deemed the brand valuation to be too high and no investment offers were made. The appearance however sharply boosted sales of the product.

Legislative referral

A Legislative referral (or legislative referendum) is a form of referendum in which a legislature puts proposed legislation up for popular vote (either voluntarily or, in the case of a constitutional amendment, as a necessary part of the procedure), rather than through the initiative or referendum process. These ballot measures, depending on the state in question, can either amend a state's constitution or enact a change in a state statute.
Bond issues are a common type of legislatively referred ballot measure. In some states, such as Oregon, if the state legislature in both chambers vote to put a measure on the ballot, the governor is not allowed to veto their action.

List of Crash Bandicoot series characters

This is a list of characters in the "Crash Bandicoot" video game series characters. "Crash Bandicoot" is a series of platform video games published by Activision. The series was formerly developed by Naughty Dog from 1996 to 1999, and by Traveller's Tales, Eurocom and Vicarious Visions from 2000 to 2004. The series features a large cast of distinctively quirky characters designed by numerous different artists, the most notable of which include Charles Zembillas and Joe Pearson. In addition, it features an all-star cast of veteran voice actors.
The series centers around the conflicts between a mutated bandicoot named Crash Bandicoot and his creator, Doctor Neo Cortex. Crash acts as the main playable character of the series, though other characters have had occasional player access, most notable Coco Bandicoot and Doctor Neo Cortex, as well as Crunch Bandicoot. Out of the numerous characters in the series (numbering over sixty), only a few have significantly contributed to the story of the series.
Protagonists.
Aku Aku.
Aku Aku is the guardian of the Wumpa Islands and the father figure of Crash Bandicoot and his friends. Aku Aku is the spirit of an ancient witch doctor encased in a floating, wooden mask. During Crash's missions to stop Doctor Cortex, he scattered copies of himself throughout the travels in an effort to aid him in his mission. Whenever Crash possesses an Aku Aku mask, he will be shielded from one enemy attack or contact. Collecting three Aku Aku masks gives Crash temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers, but does not protect from falling down holes. In his English speaking appearances, he is voiced by Mel Winkler up to "Crash Twinsanity", and Greg Eagles in "Crash of the Titans" and "Crash: Mind over Mutant". In the Japanese versions of his speaking appearances, he is voiced by Kenichi Ogata up to "Crash Twinsanity".
In the first game and ', he is a background character that help Crash. In ', his evil twin brother Uka Uka is introduced when the ruins of Cortex's space station crash into Earth and set Uka Uka free so Aku Aku tells Crash and Coco Bandicoot the story of how he locked Uka Uka up in an underground prison many eons ago. He then gives the two the assignment of gathering Crystals that lay scattered throughout time and keep them from the hands of Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex. During Crash's final fight against Doctor Neo Cortex, Aku Aku fends off Uka Uka's attacks while the fight is in session. Aku Aku appears in "Crash Team Racing" as a tutor for Crash, Coco, Polar and Pura, giving them useful tips and tricks throughout the game. He also appears as a power-up during the races, protecting the said characters from all attacks and obstacles while giving them a speed boost. However, he cannot protect the characters from chasms and deep water. In "Crash Bash", in order to resolve his constant fighting with Uka Uka, Aku Aku summons Crash and Coco as part of a contest between his players against Uka Uka, Aku Aku is later allowed to have Tiny and Dingodile into his team as to even out the number of players between them. During the course of the tournament, Aku Aku begins to suspect that Uka Uka is using the tournament to disguise a secret plot of his own. He discovers this plot to steal Crystals just in time for his team to win. Aku Aku locks the Crystals up into a secret cabinet for safekeeping, and banishes Uka Uka into the vacuum of space as punishment for trying to abuse the power of the Crystals.
When disasters ravage the world in ', Aku Aku discovers that Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex have unleashed a group of destructive masks known as the Elementals, and calls upon Crash and Coco to gather Crystals and return the Elementals to their hibernation state. In ', Aku Aku saves Crash from being kidnapped by Nefarious Tropy and N. Trance, and sends him off to gather Crystals so that he may be able to reach the villains. Aku Aku reprises his role from "Crash Team Racing" in "Crash Nitro Kart", giving useful advice and acting as a power-up for the characters Crash, Coco and Crunch. In "Crash Twinsanity", Aku Aku convinces Uka Uka to join him in order to defeat the Evil Twins, but both are easily defeated when they attempt this. Aku Aku has a cameo appearance in "Crash Tag Team Racing" as the tiki masks in the "Tiki Turbo" track. He also appears as the tutor in "Crash Boom Bang!", giving the player instructions on how to play the game. In "Crash of the Titans", Aku Aku is captured by Doctor Neo Cortex, but is rescued by Crash Bandicoot. Throughout the game, Aku Aku gives the player basic instructions, shields Crash from enemy attacks, and transforms into a skateboard to help Crash traverse slippery terrain. He reprises this role for "". Aku Aku is one of the only two characters in the game unable to be controlled by Cortex's NV device, as the device is too small to fit on his head.
A reviewer for Game Revolution compared the mechanics of the Aku Aku masks to the shields of the "Sonic the Hedgehog" series. John Scalzo of Gaming Target commented that the "booooo-ahhhhhh!” chant made by Aku Aku is "pretty slick". The sound quality of Aku Aku's voice in "Crash Team Racing" was praised by SolidSnake of PSX Extreme, while Arnold Katayev, in his review of "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", negatively described Aku Aku's voice as "melodramatic". Steven Rodriguez, in his Nintendo World Report review of "Crash Nitro Kart", described Aku Aku's voice when giving advice between races as "sexy" and cited it as the best part of the game's audio, but admitted that "even he gets rather annoying." In his review of "Crash of the Titans", Brian Rowe of Game Revolution, while citing the ability to "slap Aku Aku’s face into the ground and ride it like a surfboard" as "harshly inconsiderate", considered it "payback for his gratingly poor impersonations of that other floating head of wisdom – Frylock."
Coco Bandicoot.
Coco Bandicoot is the younger sister of Crash Bandicoot. Just as her brother Crash was, Coco was genetically engineered through the use of Doctor Neo Cortex's and Doctor Nitrus Brio's Evolvo-Ray. Coco's most notable trait is her high intelligence; her intelligence quotient is said to be as much as 164. Like her brother, Coco has a fearless nature and is willing to take any chance, unafraid of making mistakes. She is a fan of martial arts films, wrestling and NASCAR. She is also shown to be a skilled scooter rider, using this talent to outrace a Japanese tsunami on one occasion. Coco was created by Naughty Dog as a counterbalance to Tawna (Crash's girlfriend in the first game) that would appease Sony Computer Entertainment Japan, who weren't comfortable with a "super sexy" character being alongside Crash. Charles Zembillas' first sketches of Coco were drawn on March 18, 1997, when ' was in development. She is voiced by Vicki Winters in "Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back", Hynden Walch in "Crash Team Racing", and Debi Derryberry from ' onwards. In the Japanese version of the series, she is voiced by Haruna Ikezawa in the PlayStation games, Ema Kogure in "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", "Crash Nitro Kart" and "Crash Twinsanity", Satomi Arai in "Crash Tag Team Racing" and Risa Tsubaki in "Crash Boom Bang!".
Before the events of the series, Coco was an ordinary bandicoot until she was taken from the jungle and genetically enhanced by Doctor Neo Cortex. Coco is first seen in "Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back" living on N. Sanity Island with Crash. One day, when the battery for her laptop runs out, she sends Crash off to find a replacement battery for her. When Coco discovers that Crash is gathering Crystals for Cortex, she becomes suspicious of Cortex and decides to hack into Cortex's computer and see what he's really up to. What she finds are detailed schematics for an improved Cortex Vortex and a suspicious-looking space station. She learns of Cortex's real plan just as Crash has gathered all the Crystals, and reveals Cortex's intentions to Crash before he can give the Crystals to Cortex. After Cortex's plan is foiled, Coco is called upon by Aku Aku in "" to use Doctor Nefarious Tropy's Time-Twisting Machine and gather the powerful Crystals in their original places before Cortex does so. Coco helps by gathering the Crystals in 17th century China, the 18th century Pacific Ocean, and World War I Europe. She is also responsible for the defeat of Cortex's right-hand man Doctor N. Gin on the Moon, with her new pet tiger Pura assisting her. Coco is a playable character in "Crash Team Racing" and "Crash Bash". The epilogue of "Crash Team Racing" states that Coco opened up her own Internet dating service after the events of the game.
When the Elementals wreak havoc on the Earth in "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", Coco activates a new Portal Chamber for Crash to use. She helps Crash gather the Power Crystals needed to stop the Elementals by collecting them in a tsunami-ravaged China and an avalanche zone. She also stops an armada of Cortex's space stations from striking Earth. Near the end, she helps Crash and Crunch escape from Cortex's malfunctioning space station. In "Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure", Coco builds a device that reverses the effects of Cortex's Planetary Minimizer. In "Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced", Coco is abducted by N. Trance and is brainwashed alongside Crunch and Fake Crash. Coco battles Crash in a large battleship inside an active volcano, with Crash attacking the craft while it is reloading its weaponry. Upon snapping out of N. Trance's control, Coco becomes a playable character, gathering two Crystals in space while escaping the wrath of a fireball created by N. Tropy. Coco is a playable character in "Crash Nitro Kart" as well. In one cutscene, she uses her hacking skills to put the hyperactive Nash to sleep. In "Crash Twinsanity", Coco is ambushed by Doctor Neo Cortex, who disguises himself as her in order to lure Crash into a trap. Many moments later, Coco believes that Cortex kidnapped Crash, and travels to the Iceberg Lab to confront him. With a swift kick, she attacks Cortex and sends the Power Crystals he was holding flying into the Psychetron. The resulting chain reaction leaves Coco paralyzed until the end of the game. In "Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage", Coco teams up with the Professor to track down Ripto and Doctor Cortex. Later in the game, they're both kidnapped by Doctor Cortex's niece, Nina Cortex, who keeps them locked up in cages. After being freed from her cage, Coco suggests that Crash and Spyro put a tracer on Cortex and Ripto as to allow the heroes to track the villains back to their hideout. Coco's last major contribution to the story is constructing a portal to Cortex's and Ripto's lair.
Coco is a playable character in "Crash Tag Team Racing". In the game's story, Coco discovers the sole clue to whoever stole MotorWorld's Power Gems, which is Wumpa Whip. Because of Crash's high consumption of the beverage, she briefly believes (along with the others) that Crash is the culprit, despite the fact that Willie Wumpa Cheeks is the park's lone source of Wumpa Whip. At the end of the game, Coco returns the park's deed to Von Clutch, to whom it belongs. Coco plays a central role in "Crash Boom Bang!", in which she is invited by the Viscount to the World Cannonball Race in his search for the Super Big Power Crystal. In "Crash of the Titans", Coco is on the verge of creating a device that will be able to recycle butter when she is captured along with Aku Aku by Doctor Neo Cortex. When Nina replaces Cortex, Coco is brainwashed and is forced to finish the Doominator. She ends up completing the Doominator, but is rescued by Crash and is able to stop it at the end of the game. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, she appears as a vendor selling upgrades for Crash's abilities. Coco is a playable character in the cooperation mode of the Wii and Xbox 360 versions of "Crash: Mind over Mutant". At the beginning of the game, Coco converts the Doominator's eye into an entertainment system. After seeing an infomercial advertising the "NV", a do-anything personal digital assistant, she receives an NV along with Crunch and quickly becomes addicted. Soon enough, the NV, which Dr. N. Brio filled with negative Mojo, transforms her into a ferocious beast who tries to kill Crash using a giant basketball-launching machine. After being defeated and informed (to her disappointment) that the NV had a negative influence on her, she uses the Doominator's eye to access Cortex's blog and learn what Cortex is planning. She is accessible as the second player's character from that point on. Coco's availability as a playable character in "Crash: Mind over Mutant" was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. In the PlayStation 2 version, she is replaced by a white-furred version of her brother named "Carbon Crash".
Coco has been featured in two series of "Crash Bandicoot" action figures produced by the now-defunct Resaurus. For "Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back", Resaurus produced a Coco Bandicoot figure bundled with figures of a penguin and lizard from the game. The "Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped" series featured two different figures of Coco, including one bundled with Aku Aku and Crash Bandicoot figures. Coco's inclusion and incorporation as a playable character in "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex" was met with a generally lukewarm response among critics. Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt that Coco was a "less powerful" and "less enjoyable" character than Crash and that "she was just not fun the way Crash is". On the subject, Hilary added that "Crash is a silly creature to look at. He's almost absurd, which works great with his various animations. Coco isn't really silly at all. The game isn't called "Crash and Coco" so why must I be forced to play her? Rather than add variety, Coco detracts from the only real selling point of the game -- Crash Bandicoot." Matthew Gallant of GameSpot noted that "When you play a level as Coco instead of Crash, there's no explanation or warning given--you'll simply enter the level's portal as Crash and come out the other end as Coco. It's not all bad, but compared with (Super Mario) "Sunshine", it seems very uneven." Debi Derryberry's voice acting as Coco has garnered mixed reviews in the series as a whole. Arnold Katayev of PSX Extreme was positive about her voice in "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", while Matt Keller of PALGN felt that her voice in "Crash of the Titans" was "annoying".
Crunch Bandicoot.
Crunch Bandicoot is a genetically altered bandicoot who was originally created by Doctor Cortex to destroy Crash Bandicoot. After his defeat, Crunch had a change of heart and now tries to be a positive role model to children. He is Crash and Coco's older brother and protects them from harm. He is voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson in "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex" and "Crash Nitro Kart", and Chris Williams (in the style of Mr. T) in the Radical Entertainment games. In the Japanese version of the series, he is voiced by Yūji Kishi in "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex" and "Crash Nitro Kart", Masafumi Kimura in "Crash Tag Team Racing", and Shinya Fukumatsu in "Crash Boom Bang!". Crunch is the only bandicoot to have had different eye colors, as his eyes were green in The Wrath of Cortex, blue in Crash Nitro Kart, and red for Crash Tag Team Racing onwards.
Crunch was created by Doctor Cortex in private as a superweapon that would be capable of frightening power. Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nefarious Tropy (who only had a slight understanding of the project) were the only other individuals who knew about the weapon. During a bad guy convention held by Uka Uka, Tropy and N. Gin reveal the weapon in desperation for one good plan to defeat Crash Bandicoot, whom Uka Uka wants eliminated. Doctor Cortex formally announces the superweapon, but reveals that it is still missing a power source. Hearing the word "element", Uka Uka brings up the Elementals, a group of destructive masks that could create enough energy to bring the secret weapon to life. The weapon, who is Crunch Bandicoot, attempts to defeat Crash with the aid of the Elemental masks, but when Crunch is defeated in Cortex's space station, he snaps out of Doctor Cortex's control. Although his first instinct is to introduce his fist to Cortex's face, Aku Aku informs Crunch of the space station's imminent destruction, and the group decides to flee back to Earth. Back on Earth, Crunch shows his gratitude toward the Bandicoots, and becomes part of the Bandicoot family. In "Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced", Crunch is abducted by N. Trance and is brainwashed alongside Coco and Fake Crash. Crash battles Crunch on a flying carpet over the skies of Saudi Arabia, with Crash firing shots of energy at Crunch whenever the latter is stunned by exploding Nitro crates. Upon snapping out of N. Trance's control, Crunch becomes a playable character in some of the Atlasphere levels. Crunch is a playable character in "Crash Nitro Kart" as well. In "Crash Twinsanity", Crunch has a cameo in Crash's "birthday party", which is a gathering of past "Crash" villains. While Crunch is in the gathering, he actually believes that it is really Crash's birthday, donning a green paper crown and holding a slice of cake. Crunch has a minor appearance in "Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage", aiding Crash in the "Weighlift" segments of the game.
Crunch appears as a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart "Crash Tag Team Racing" and "Crash Boom Bang!". In "Crash of the Titans", Crunch is ambushed by Doctor Cortex during the beginning of the first episode, leaving him frozen from the neck down. He stays this way until the end of the game, in which the Doominator's collapse is able to set Crunch free. Crunch does not appear in the DS version of the game. In the Game Boy Advance version, Crunch is taken prisoner by Tiny Tiger by order of Neo Cortex. He is freed upon Tiny's defeat. Crunch appears in "Crash: Mind over Mutant" and becomes addicted to the NV device alongside Coco to the point where he is unable to help Crash and Aku Aku when they are attacked by N. Gin's Ratnician army. He is later mutated by the bad Mojo transmitted by the NV and runs off, leaving a mutated Coco to fend off Crash. He is later found at the Junkyard, where Nitrus Brio commands Crunch to attack Crash. He is soon freed from the NV's control, but continues to be beaten up by Crash for a short time. He then decides to go back home and get some sleep.
Antagonists.
Doctor N. Gin.
Doctor N. Gin (spelled N-Gin in the Radical Entertainment games) was the right-hand man of Doctor Neo Cortex, replacing Doctor Nitrus Brio after Crash Bandicoot. He has since been replaced by the person he succeeded, Nitrus Brio. He is voiced by Brendan O'Brien in the Naughty Dog games, by Corey Burton in "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", by Quinton Flynn in "Crash Nitro Kart" and "Crash Twinsanity", and by Nolan North (in the style of Peter Lorre) in the Radical Entertainment games. In the Japanese version of the series, he is voiced by Kazuhiro Nakata in the games up to "Crash Twinsanity", and by Mitsuru Ogata in "Crash Tag Team Racing". His name is a wordplay on the word "engine".
As a child, N. Gin was a classmate of Neo Cortex and Nitrus Brio in Madame Amberley's Academy of Evil. After working at a stapler factory for a time, N. Gin went on to become a world-renowned physicist in the defense industry. However, due to a budget cut, one of his missile projects ended up faulty and, as a result, went awry, lodging itself into N. Gin's head. With his intellect, N. Gin was able to stabilize the weapon and reconstruct it as a life support system at the cost of his sanity. Because the missile is still live, it activates whenever N. Gin is stressed or angry, leaving him with a large headache (a trait inspired by creator Jason Rubin's own chronic migraine headaches). Shortly after the missile incident, Doctor N. Gin was taken in by Doctor Neo Cortex to replace the double-crossed Doctor Nitrus Brio. Studying a large Crystal found by Cortex after his defeat to Crash Bandicoot, N. Gin discovers that 25 smaller "Slave Crystals" are needed alongside this "Master Crystal" in order to power Cortex's new "Cortex Vortex" device. When Crash is ordered by Doctor Cortex to give the Crystals he has gathered to N. Gin, N. Gin attempts to take the Crystals by force, only to be sent spiraling into the vacuum of space when Crash destroys his prized mecha. After the destruction of this mecha, N. Gin constructed a superior model: a suit of mobile armor that could transform into a space fighter and dock with a huge weapon platform. N. Gin uses this machine to confront Coco Bandicoot on the Moon in "", only to fail once again. N. Gin appears as a playable character in "Crash Team Racing" and as an obstacle in a "Ballistix" level in "Crash Bash". The epilogue of "Crash Team Racing" states that N. Gin opened a custom auto parts store in Toledo, Ohio, only to have it close down after a massive recall due to the damage caused by his patented "Clear-the-Road" missile system.
In "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", N. Gin is an attendee of Uka Uka's bad guy convention, and is ultimately the one who reveals the secret of Crunch Bandicoot, Cortex's new superweapon. For the rest of the game, N. Gin serves as an obstacle in some of the levels. In "Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure", N. Gin battles Crash in the skies with a weapon platform similar to the one he piloted in "Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped". He is later merged with Doctor Cortex, Tiny and Dingodile, and becomes Mega-Mix. After chasing Crash down a space station hall, Mega-Mix is left inside the space station, which explodes with the villains in it. N. Gin is a playable character in "Crash Nitro Kart". In one cutscene, N. Gin considers creating cybernetic sharks as new henchmen after racing Nash. In "Crash Twinsanity", N. Gin appears during the first boss battle, piloting the Mecha-Bandicoot in an attempt to eliminate Crash. When all of its weapons are destroyed, the Mecha-Bandicoot stomps a hole into the floor and falls into a cavern. N. Gin is later seen as the captain of his own battleship. At the crow's nest, N. Gin tries to destroy Crash with a barrage of missiles, occasionally tossing a TNT Crate. This leads to the eventual collapse of the crow's nest, causing N. Gin to land on his head onto a pile of TNT Crates, creating a large explosion that sinks the battleship. N. Gin is last seen teamed up with N. Tropy and N. Brio, with all of them trying to steal the Evil Twins' riches. However, they are driven out by Spyro the Dragon.
N. Gin is a playable character in "Crash Tag Team Racing". In the game's story, N. Gin convinces Neo Cortex to join in the search for Von Clutch's missing Power Gems so that he can use Von Clutch's theme park as a new base of operations (although Cortex later claims the idea as his own). He has a cameo appearance in the "Silhouette Quiz" minigame in "Crash Boom Bang!". In "Crash of the Titans", N. Gin opposes Doctor Cortex's replacement by praising Cortex's stationery. N. Gin is next seen in his weapons factory, which appears on the outside as a version of the Statue of Liberty modelled after N. Gin. This factory constantly bombards the surrounding area with all kinds of explosives in an attempt to hinder Crash. Inside the factory, N. Gin communicates to his workers through the factory intercom, making announcements, singing inspirational songs, or alerting the workers of Crash's presence. In the factory's crown, N. Gin spends his days performing on his enormous pipe organ. When confronted by Crash and Aku Aku, N. Gin indirectly reveals to them that he has mixed feelings over Cortex's replacement to Nina. One side likes Doctor Cortex and the abuse he brings to him and wishes for his return, while another side approves of Nina's new way of doing things, believing that she is a more efficient leader than Cortex. Eventually, the two sides reach a compromise, and tell Crash of Uka Uka's whereabouts in hopes that he will also free Cortex, planning to shower them with doom later on. In "Crash: Mind over Mutant", N. Gin leads an attack on Crash Bandicoot when Coco and Crunch become addicted to Cortex's and Brio's personal digital assistant, fleeing to a small observatory on Wumpa Island afterwards. When Crash and Aku Aku catch up to him, N. Gin reveals that ever since Doctor Cortex escaped the Doominator, he has been secretly watching the Bandicoot family and collecting information on them, hoping to be rewarded with the ownership of Wumpa Island if Cortex is triumphant in his current plot. After Crash fends off N. Gin's army of Ratnicians, N. Gin is sternly told by Aku Aku to leave the island, to which N. Gin reluctantly complies.
Uka Uka.
Uka Uka is the evil younger twin brother of Aku Aku. Uka Uka was created by Naughty Dog as a presence that was able to cause even Neo Cortex to cower in fear. He was voiced by Clancy Brown from 1998 to 2003, by Alex Fernandez in "Crash Twinsanity", and by John DiMaggio in "Crash of the Titans" and "Crash: Mind over Mutant". He is voiced by Ryūzaburō Ōtomo in the Japanese versions of his appearances up to "Crash Twinsanity".
Several eons before the events of the series, Uka Uka was locked away by Aku Aku in an underground prison due to his malevolent nature. Several millennia after his incarceration, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Cortex to fulfill his desire to enslave humanity, only to have Doctor Cortex lose the Crystals and the Gems, and have his space station destroyed. The rubble of the ruined space station eventually crash-lands onto Earth, destroying the underground prison, and finally freeing Uka Uka. Upset with Cortex's failure to retrieve the Crystals and the Gems, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Nefarious Tropy, who has created the Time Twister, which will allow them to collect the Crystals and the Gems in their original places. And, since Cortex's failure also managed to set him free, Uka Uka still felt a sense of gratitude and generosity. When Crash intervenes and destroys the Time Twister, Uka Uka is trapped inside a time prison with Doctor Cortex and N. Tropy, who have been turned into infants. Uka Uka appears in "Crash Team Racing" as a tutor for the characters Cortex, N. Gin, Tiny, and Dingodile, giving them useful tips and tricks throughout the game. He also appears as a power-up during the races, protecting the said characters (along with Ripper Roo, Papu Papu, Komodo Joe, Pinstripe Potoroo and Doctor Nefarious Tropy) from all attacks and obstacles while giving them a speed boost. However, he cannot protect the characters from chasms and deep water. In "Crash Bash", in order to resolve his constant fighting with Aku Aku, Uka Uka summons Cortex, Brio, Tiny, Dingodile, Koala Kong, and Rilla Roo as part of a contest between his players against Aku Aku. Uka Uka is later forced to relinquish Tiny and Dingodile to Aku Aku's team to even out the number of players between them.
In "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", Uka Uka scolds Cortex and the rest of the villains for their less-than-impressive evil productivity. Fed up with Cortex's incompetence, Uka Uka concludes that if global domination is to ever be achieved, Crash should be handled with personally. Deciding to use Cortex's new super-weapon to wipe out Crash Bandicoot, he revives the Elementals to act as the super-weapon's source of power and bring it to life. When Crash imprisons the Elementals, defeats the super-weapon, and brings it to their side, Uka Uka holds Cortex responsible and fires an energy blast at him out of anger, but in doing so causes their newly built space station to overload, forcing Cortex and Uka Uka to evacuate. Their escape pod lands in the depths of Antarctica, stranding them both on a sheet of ice. Uka Uka oversees the evil plots of both Neo Cortex and Nefarious Tropy in "Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure" and "Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced" respectively, becoming annoyed when both of them fail. Uka Uka reprises his role from "Crash Team Racing" in "Crash Nitro Kart", giving useful advice and acting as a power-up for the characters Neo Cortex, N. Gin, Tiny Tiger and N. Tropy. In "Crash Twinsanity", Uka Uka is freed from a wall of ice, but is enraged to see that Cortex has teamed up with Crash in order to defeat the Evil Twins, and transforms into an Ice Titan in order to kill both of them, considering that he still held a grudge against Cortex for his past failures. When he is defeated, Uka Uka attempts to flee, but Aku Aku stops him and tells him about the Evil Twins' plot to destroy the Earth. Opposed to the fact that someone else is trying to destroy the world (a job that he believes is his), Uka Uka temporarily teams up with his twin brother, only to be defeated alongside him by the Evil Twins' ability to warp reality.
Uka Uka has a cameo appearance in "Crash Boom Bang!" as a purchaseable power-up. In "Crash of the Titans", Uka Uka teaches Doctor Cortex a new process called "Mojo mutations", which uses a magical substance known as Mojo to mutate any living creature into a loyal minion of Cortex. At the Temple of Zoom, Uka Uka leaves Doctor Cortex to destroy Crash and Aku Aku while he returns to the base with an enormous amount of stolen Mojo and Coco Bandicoot at tow. When Cortex fails to defeat Crash, Uka Uka becomes furious, and announces that he is replacing Doctor Cortex, much to the shock of his minions. In a lab on the island's giant tree, Uka Uka expresses his relief with Nina Cortex's higher competence, but begins to sense Aku Aku's presence nearby, and decides to stay in the lab and kill Crash Bandicoot himself. Uka Uka confronts Crash as the penultimate boss by using Doctor Cortex's Evolvo-Ray on himself, giving him a gargantuan body made from the tree's wood. When the Evolvo-Ray is destroyed, Uka Uka claims that he will have the last laugh, as Nina is about to launch the Doominator, threatening the existence of Wumpa Island. Uka Uka is absent in the Nintendo DS version of the game. In "Crash: Mind over Mutant", Uka Uka is subdued and placed in a milking machine by Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nitrus Brio so that he can be used as a source of the bad Mojo needed to control those using the mass-produced NV device. He is eventually freed by Crash and Aku Aku, and promises to take the two to Cortex's new space station if his magical bones are returned to him. When this task is completed, Uka Uka keeps his promise and warps Crash and Aku Aku to Cortex's space station as an act of vengeance against Cortex.
Tiny Tiger.
Tiny Tiger (erroneously named Taz Tiger in the pause screen of the North American version of "Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back") is a minion of Doctor Neo Cortex. He is voiced by Brendan O'Brien in the PlayStation games, by John DiMaggio in "Crash Nitro Kart" by Chris Williams (in the style of Mike Tyson) in "Crash of the Titans" and "Crash: Mind over Mutant", and by Nolan North in the Nintendo DS version of "Crash of the Titans". In the Japanese version of the series, he is voiced by Fumihiko Tachiki in the PlayStation games, and by Masafumi Kimura in "Crash Nitro Kart".
It is implied in at least two instruction manuals that Tiny was Doctor Cortex's first foray into genetic alteration. However, this conflicts with what was established by Naughty Dog, who confirmed that Ripper Roo was Cortex's first serious creation. Following the orders of Doctor Nitrus Brio, Tiny attempts to eliminate Crash as the third boss of "Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back", but is unsuccessful in the end. By "Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped", Tiny has joined forces with Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka. His first duty working under Cortex is attempting to take whatever Crystals Crash and Coco have gathered and bringing them to Cortex in the Colosseum. Tiny is once again unsuccessful, as a fight against Crash in the Colosseum proves fruitless. Tiny appears as a playable character in "Crash Team Racing" and "Crash Bash". The epilogue of "Crash Team Racing" states that Tiny moved to Beverly Hills and founded a chain of fitness clubs after the events of the game.
In "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", Tiny is an attendee in Uka Uka's bad guy convention, not speaking a single line in the entire game. He later serves as an obstacle in certain levels, literally standing in Crash's way in an attempt to hinder him, as well as operating various flying vehicles in levels involving planes or spaceships. In "Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure", Tiny serves as the third boss, fighting Crash near a large waterfall. He is later merged with Doctor Cortex, N. Gin, and Dingodile, and becomes Mega-Mix. After chasing Crash down a space station hall, Mega-Mix is left inside the space station, which explodes with the villains in it. Tiny is a playable character in "Crash Nitro Kart". In the game's story, Tiny is seen playing checkers with himself (and later, attempting to assist N. Gin) when the tower the villains are standing in is abducted. When Emperor Velo is defeated, Tiny, Cortex, and N. Gin are teleported to Terra, where Tiny gains the respect of the inhabitants. Tiny has a cameo appearance (along with other "Crash" villains) in "Crash Twinsanity" during Crash's "birthday party". In the crossover game "Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage", Tiny acts as the second boss, attempting to obliterate Crash in a frozen tundra with a tank. Tiny has a cameo appearance in "Crash Boom Bang!", appearing in the "Silhouette Quiz" minigame. In "Crash of the Titans", Tiny protests Neo Cortex's replacement alongside Doctor N. Gin by praising Cortex's stationery. Tiny is the one in charge of the mining operations seen in Episodes 5 through 7, responsible for destroying a portion of the jungle and obtaining minerals from the volcano. When Crash distrupts these operations, Tiny confronts Crash directly and voices his displeasure in both Crash's antics and the fact that he wasn't invited to "Crash Tag Team Racing". When Crash confronts Tiny with the Shellephant, Tiny decides to reveal the whereabouts of Crash's sister. Although Tiny isn't seen physically in "Crash: Mind over Mutant", his voice can be heard in the game's credits when he tries to correct Crunch when he mixes up his metaphors.
Dingodile.
Dingodile is the ally of Doctor Neo Cortex. Dingodile was conceptualized by Naughty Dog employee Joe Labbe, who requested a character that was a cross between a dingo and a crocodile. Charles Zembillas drew the first sketches of Dingodile on February 4, 1998. At certain points, the character alternatively wore an aussie, had a "mop of scruffy hair" and walked on all fours. Naughty Dog initially wanted Dingodile to be a fire-breathing character before Zembillas suggested giving him a flamethrower to make him "much more interesting". The final sketches of Dingodile were drawn on February 12, 1998. Zembillas has expressed happiness at Dingodile's enthusiastic following amongst fans. Dingodile is voiced by William Hootkins in "Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped", by Chip Chinery in "Crash Team Racing", by Dwight Schultz in "Crash Nitro Kart" and "Crash Twinsanity", and by Nolan North in the Nintendo DS version of "Crash of the Titans". In the Japanese version of the series, he is voiced by Keisuke Ishida in the PlayStation games, and by Hajime Iijima in "Crash Nitro Kart" and "Crash Twinsanity".
Dingodile made his debut in the video game "Crash Bandicoot: Warped" as the second boss of the game. Here, he is seen serving under Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex, attempting to take whatever Crystals Crash has gathered and bringing them to Cortex during the Ice Age under his orders. Crash encounters Dingodile as he is about to kill a penguin, who runs away upon Crash's arrival. When Dingodile is defeated, he warns Crash of the more powerful enemies he will face ahead as the penguin he tried to kill earlier hops up and down on his charred body. Dingodile is a playable character in "Crash Team Racing" and "Crash Bash". The epilogue of "Crash Team Racing" states that Dingodile created an animal breeding program to create unique and interesting pets. Dingodile also appears in Crash Bash as a playable character.
Dingodile appears as an attendee of Uka Uka's bad guy convention. He later serves as an obstacle in certain levels, firing spurts of flamethrower ammo in an attempt to stop Crash. In "Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure", Dingodile serves as the first boss. He fights Crash in a shark-infested underwater cavern, and fires torpedoes at the cavern ceiling in an attempt to impale Crash with the falling stalactites, but eventually manages to impale himself, leaving him open for attack. He is later merged with Doctor Cortex, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger, and becomes Mega-Mix. After chasing Crash down a space station hall, Mega-Mix is left inside the space station, which explodes with the villains in it. Dingodile is a playable character in "Crash Nitro Kart". In the game's story, Dingodile is seen assisting Doctor N. Gin when the tower the villains are standing in is abducted. The next time he is seen, he is brainwashed by N. Trance and racing under N. Trance's team, which drives green vehicles. In "Crash Twinsanity", Dingodile is seen as one of the attendees of Crash's "birthday party" (which is really a gathering of past villains in the "Crash" series). After watching the ensuing boss battle, he discusses lunch with Ripper Roo. Later, he is seen reading inside a small shack, but is interrupted when a large snowball (containing Crash and Cortex) crushes the shack with him in it. As Cortex laments his humiliation, Dingodile learns of the Evil Twins' treasure, and secretly follows Crash and Cortex to the boiler room of Madame Amberly's Academy of Evil, where he tries to kill Crash for the treasure, believing he already has it. However, with the help of the boiler room's emergengy sprinkler system, Crash is able to disable Dingodile's flamethrower and beat him into submission. Dingodile is last seen laying unconscious in the boiler room. While Dingodile doesn't appear in the console version of "Crash of the Titans", he appears as the first boss in the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance versions on the game. In the Nintendo DS version, Dingodile is assigned to stalling Crash Bandicoot while the other villains gather materials and build Neo Cortex's new CortexBot. Dingodile attempts to defeat Crash with a new water cannon, but ultimately fails. In the Game Boy Advance version, Dingodile is given the task of sending barrels of oil from Wumpa Island to Tiki Island. He is defeated by Crash, who attacks him with inhabited bee hives.
Doctor Nefarious Tropy.
Doctor Nefarious Tropy is a henchman of Uka Uka and the self-proclaimed master of time. He was created by Naughty Dog as a time-traveling boss that would fit in a time-traveling plot. Charles Zembillas drew the first sketches of Tropy (and the doodle he created as Naughty Dog was describing the character to him) on January 22, 1998. Tropy's wearable time-traveling device was conceptualized early on in the character's design evolution and initially appeared as a belt-like contraption that featured a digital read out displaying the year Tropy intended to travel to. At one point in its aesthetic development, Tropy's time machine was covered in clock gears and mechanisms, including a cuckoo clock on the machine's lower-right area; Zembillas assumed that the details could be created as a texture in Adobe Photoshop and placed over the modeled character's polygon structure. Furthermore, the pistons on the back of the machine were connected to each other through joint-like bearings. These details were ultimately omitted for being too complex for the original PlayStation console to handle. The exhaust pipes and pistons were retained due to their reflection of Tropy's unhealthy obsession with time. Tropy is voiced by Michael Ensign in all his speaking appearances excluding "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", in which he is voiced by Corey Burton. He is voiced by Masaru Ikeda in the Japanese versions of "Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped", "Crash Team Racing" and "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex" and by Haruo Satō in the Japanese versions of "Crash Nitro Kart" and "Crash Twinsanity". His name is abbreviated as N. Tropy, which is a play on "entropy", a comment on his clock-like form.
Doctor Nefarious Tropy is introduced by Uka Uka in "Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped" as the creator of the Time-Twisting Machine, a device that will aid Neo Cortex in his quest to gather the Crystals in their original places in time. He later acts as the third boss of the game, battling Crash with his gigantic tuning fork. When Cortex is defeated, the Time-Twisting Machine implodes on itself, trapping Cortex, Uka Uka and Tropy in a time prison, where they are transformed into infants. Tropy appears in "Crash Team Racing" as the player's opponent during the Time Trial races and later as an unlockable playable character. The game's epilogue states that Tropy resumed his time machine hobby after the events of the game, and was last seen entering an ancient rainforest. N. Tropy has a minor appearance in "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex", in which he is an attendee of Uka Uka's convention and an occasional enemy in the game, attempting to hinder Crash's progress. He is the main antagonist of "Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced", in which he kidnaps Crunch, Coco and Fake Crash and hypnotizes them into working for him. He is later defeated by Crash and is forced to take a group picture with the Bandicoots. Tropy is an unlockable character in "Crash Nitro Kart", where he races under Neo Cortex's team. Tropy appears again in "Crash Twinsanity", where he works with Doctor Nitrus Brio in order to learn the whereabouts of the treasure of the Evil Twins. When interrogating Crash proves fruitless, the duo attack him, sending him back to Cortex's Iceberg Lab. They eventually reach the treasure trove of the Evil Twins, but are chased out by Spyro the Dragon. Tropy also has a cameo appearance in the "Silhouette Quiz" minigame in "Crash Boom Bang!"
Doctor Nitrus Brio.
Doctor Nitrus Brio is a scientist who formerly worked under Doctor Neo Cortex. Brio was created by Naughty Dog as a foil for Doctor Cortex: "meek to Cortex's strength, logical to Cortex's emotional, successful (his inventions work) to Cortex's failure." Brio is voiced by Brendan O'Brien in the English versions of "Crash Bandicoot", "Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back" and "Crash Bash", and by Maurice LaMarche in "Crash: Mind over Mutant". He is voiced by Mitsuru Ogata in the Japanese version of the series up to "Crash Bash". His name is often abbreviated to "N. Brio", a wordplay on "embryo".
As a child, Nitrus Brio was a classmate of Neo Cortex and N. Gin in Madame Amberly's Academy of Evil. Brio is responsible for creating the first fully functional Evolvo-Ray. However, his lack of self-esteem allowed Doctor Cortex to take credit for the creation. Brio is the penultimate boss of the first game, transforming himself into a hulking beast (through use of his trademark mutagenic agent), to combat Crash. After his failure, Brio left Cortex to become a bartender. Whilst away, he plotted to destroy Cortex for good with the use of a giant laser. Brio manages to convince Crash to gather the 42 Gems needed for the laser to be operational, and gives him the honor of activating the weapon, destroying Cortex's space station. While Brio does not appear in "Crash Team Racing", a brand of beakers used as weapons during the races feature his name. Brio reunites with Cortex as a playable character in "Crash Bash".
In "Crash Twinsanity", Brio teams up with Doctor Nefarious Tropy to defeat Cortex and gain the Evil Twins Treasure. He appears alongside Tropy in a boss fight, immediately following Crash's escape from N. Gin's battleship, in which Brio (after being instructed by N. Tropy to "get changed") drinks a potion to transform himself into a large, green frog-like monster. He then appears (in his human form) alongside N. Tropy and N. Gin again in the Evil Twins' fortress, claiming the Twins' treasure for themselves. However, they are thwarted by Spyro the Dragon, who had been trapped in the Twins' vault. Brio reunites with Neo Cortex once more in "Crash: Mind over Mutant", in which he aids in the development of the NV, a personal digital assistant that can control both mutants and bandicoots. He uses recycled parts from the Sludge Junkyard to mass-produce NVs and create a new space station for Doctor Cortex. Throughout the game, he claims to be the inventor of numerous things, including recycling, Slinkies and endings (though he does acknowledge he did not invent LiteBrite). He is found in the Junkyard with a brainwashed Crunch Bandicoot by Crash and Aku Aku, who are then attacked by Crunch under Brio's orders. When Crunch is broken free from the NV's control, Brio is forced to reveal the whereabouts of Uka Uka, who is acting as the source of the negative Mojo needed to control those wearing NVs. He is then told to leave the island, but promises that it is not the end.
Nina Cortex.
Nina Cortex is the "niece" of Doctor Neo Cortex. She is voiced by Susan Silo in "Crash Twinsanity" and Amy Gross in Radical Entertainment games though Debi Derryberry in the DS version of "Crash of the Titans". She sometimes aids her uncle in his quest for world domination, though they have had a recent falling-out due to a failed plot headed by her and Cortex's boss Uka Uka. Nina Cortex was originally created by Traveller's Tales as a playable character in "Crash Nitro Kart" before development duties of the game were transferred to Vicarious Visions. During her conception it was undecided whether she would be Neo Cortex's daughter or niece, hence the deliberate discrepancies regarding her relationship with Cortex in "Crash Twinsanity". Her appearance was based on one of the designers working at Traveller's Tales. An early design of her depicted her wearing a white lab coat similar to Neo Cortex's.
Nina is known to be more ambitious and egotistical than her uncle; even Aku Aku believes that Nina is "a lot smarter than Cortex ever could be." Despite her self-admittedly antisocial demeanor, she is said to have a love for animals. Nina's most distinguishing features are her spring-loaded steel bionic hands, which were given to her by her uncle Doctor Cortex. Nina stands about four feet and eleven inches (1.5 meters) and weighs 110 pounds (50 kilograms).
When Nina Cortex started to show signs of a kind heart, Doctor Cortex modified her arms with bionic parts and enrolled her in Madame Amberly's Private Academy, which he himself attended as a child. She doesn't see her uncle again until the Evil Twins threaten the existence of the N. Sanity Island in "Crash Twinsanity", during which Doctor Cortex sneaks her out of the school to assist him in defeating the Evil Twins. When Crash, Cortex and Nina travel to the Tenth Dimension, Nina is kidnapped by the feral Evil Crash and taken to his house for a tea party, where Cortex soon rescues Nina. She later helps in defeating the Evil Twins by destroying the power sources of their Deathbot.
In "Crash of the Titans", when Cortex fails to dispose of Crash Bandicoot, Nina is called upon by Uka Uka to replace her uncle as the main antagonist of the story. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, Nina attempts to take over Cortex's plot on her own accord when she realizes that she's merely a henchman. When Crash confronts her inside the Doominator, Nina boards her giant Arachnina Titan and battles Crash, only to lose. When the Doominator is disabled, she is rescued from the falling contraption by Doctor Cortex, who reveals that he is proud that she betrayed him, but proceeds to drop her off at his public school as punishment for doing so, as seen in "Crash: Mind over Mutant". When she is eventually visited by Crash and Aku Aku, she angrily accuses Crash of ruining her life and refuses to help them stop Cortex's ongoing plot. When Crash and Aku Aku get desperate, she forces the two to kiss each other and save her science fair project. She then uses the said project to determine the location of Crunch and Brio, who are at the Sludge's Junkyard.
In "Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage" and "Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy", Nina is recruited by Doctor Cortex to kidnap Coco Bandicoot and the Professor. When Spyro and Crash arrive to save Coco and the Professor, Nina chases down Crash, only to soon be captured in a cage. Nina is a playable character in "Crash Tag Team Racing", in which she aids Doctor Cortex and N. Gin in trying to take over Von Clutch's MotorWorld.
Nina's introduction in "Crash Twinsanity" was met with a positive response among critics. James B. Pringle of IGN said that Nina "almost steals the show with her sassy skip and her "Bionic Commando"-like extension arm" and admitted that he "actually wouldn't mind seeing more of Nina in the future." Nick Valentino of GameZone praised her as "an inventive character", a "very welcome addition to the series" and "one of the many highlights this game has to offer". He also compared her bionic arms to "Bionic Commando".

Grange Fair

The Grange Fair is an annual fair and camping event held in Centre Hall in Centre County, Pennsylvania each year since 1874. The fair is typically held in the last full week of August. 
It consists of thousands of people camping at the fairgrounds in large, green, rented tents with asphalt floors. Thousands more stay in their own recreational vehicles, parked on the grounds. In addition to those staying on the fair grounds, daily visitors come for rides, food, bingo, animal shows, livestock contests and concerts.
Families stay in the same tent each year and tent locations are often passed down through generations. The wait for a tent reservation is said to be years long.

Harriet Burns

Harriet Burns (August 20, 1928 – July 25, 2008) was an American artist and designer. Burns was the first woman hired in the Walt Disney Imagineering department within the Walt Disney Company.
Biography.
Early life.
Burns was born Harriet Tapp in San Antonio, Texas, on August 20, 1928, and raised in Seguin, Texas. She earned her bachelor's degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas and studied advanced design at the University of New Mexico.
Harriet Tapp married William Burns, and the couple moved to Los Angeles with their infant daughter in 1953. William Burns died in 1986.
Walt Disney Imagineering.
Burns' first job in Los Angeles was at Dice Display Industries Cooperative Exchange. She designed props and sets for television shows, including the "Colgate Comedy Hour", as well as interiors and sets for floor shows and hotels in Las Vegas, including The Dunes. She also worked at a tourist attraction theme park in Lake Arrowhead, California, called Santa's Village during the mid-1950s. When the attraction closed, a friend advised Burns to apply for open positions at Disney.
Burns began working at Disney Studios in 1955 as a prop and set painter for the "Mickey Mouse Club". She helped to design and build the famed Mouse Clubhouse which was a featured fixture on the show. Her appearance caused her to stand out on the set, as she dressed in high heels and a skirt to work with the hardware and tools, such as the drill press and sanders.
Burns shared a workstation at the Disney Studio with a fellow Disney employee named Fred Joerger. Joerger was a model builder for WED Enterprises, which is now known as Walt Disney Imagineering. He was working on prototype models for the future Disneyland theme park. In addition to her job as a set builder, Burns began working with Joerger in Disney's model shop building miniature prototypes of Disneyland buildings and attractions. WED Enterprises originally consisted of just three members — Harriet Burns, Fred Joerger and Wathel Rogers — and became known as the WED Model Shop. WED Enterprises was eventually renamed to Walt Disney Imagineering, which alluded to the engineering and imagination needed to design Disney theme park attractions.
Burns contributed greatly to the development of Disneyland at WED Enterprises by creating both miniature models and actual theme park attractions. One of Burns's first assignments was to craft a model of Sleeping Beauty Castle, a Disneyland landmark which opened with the theme park on July 17, 1955. She continued to work on Disneyland expansions after the park's grand opening. Burns designed models of the Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction as a 1/100th scale replica of the famous Matterhorn in Switzerland.
Another of Burns's job at Disneyland was what is called "figure-finishing." Figure-finishing involves applying paint and other finishes to Disneyland attractions and mannequins to create a "finished" look. Burns personally designed and painted the set pieces and underwater figurines for the Submarine Voyage ride. She applied individual feathers to the animatronic birds in Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, which opened in 1963. Burns later confessed in a 2005 interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Tiki Room birds were one of her most challenging projects ever. "When they breathed out, it would be fine, but when they came back they scrunched. They looked like they had mites." She managed to fix the look of the birds and actively maintained the Tiki Room attraction after its opening. Similarly, she created the birds for the film, Mary Poppins. 
Burns also helped with the models and final designs of New Orleans Square, one of the themed lands at Disneyland. She also designed the attractions within New Orleans Square. She built an exact model of the entire Pirates of the Caribbean dark ride, which opened in 1967, and was also a figure finisher on the pirates mannequins. She similarly designed The Haunted Mansion, which opened to the public in 1969.
Outside of Disneyland, Burns was part of a team of Disney employees, which included Joyce Carlson, which created several Disney attractions for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Burns contributions to the World's Fair including designing Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, which later opened at Disneyland, and the Carousel of Progress.
Her work earned the attention of Walt Disney. He featured Burns on several episodes of "The Wonderful World of Color", a 1960s television show which gave a behind-the-scenes look at the Walt Disney Company, including its theme parks.
Burns retired from Walt Disney Imagineering in 1986. She was honored in 1992 with a window display of her work on Main Street, U.S.A. in Disneyland with a commemorative plaque that reads, "The Artisans Loft, Handmade Miniatures by Harriet Burns." She was the first woman in Disney history to receive this honor. Burns was also designated a Disney Legend by the Walt Disney Company in 2000, as an employee "whose imagination, talents and dreams have created the Disney magic."
Death.
Harriet Burns died of complications from a heart condition at USC University Hospital in Los Angeles on July 25, 2008, at the age of 79. Burns was survived by her daughter, Pam Burns-Clair; two sisters, Wilma Draves and Suzie Mosteller; two granddaughters, Chelsea and Haley Clair; and many extended family members. She was a resident of Santa Barbara, California where she had been active in the arts and music community.

Stage Debut

Stage Debut was a game planned to be published and developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo Gamecube video game console. The game was intended for a 2004 release, but was indefinitely delayed, probably due to the cancellation of its sister peripheral for the Game Boy Advance, the GameEye.
Gameplay.
Stage Debut was designed similarly to a game titled Mario Artist: Talent Studio developed for the Nintendo 64's Nintendo 64DD peripheral. The player would take a picture of their face using the Game Boy Advance's Game Eye peripheral (which was planned to be, in short, a spiritual successor to the Game Boy Camera). Then, by linking the GameEye to the Gamecube system via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable, the player would be able to insert the image onto a 3D model within the game's virtual world.
Status of Development.
Stage Debut was widely assumed as either a canceled project or a project in development hell after no progress in development was announced on the title by Nintendo for quite some time. However, in a 2008 interview with Shigeru Miyamoto by the popular gaming news site IGN, an official answer was made. Not only did he cite Stage Debut as an inspiration for the Wii's Mii Channel function, he also said that "In my mind, it's still alive." While this does not deny the cancellation of the project, it does not confirm it will never come to pass.

America's Best Dance Crew (season 3)

The third season of "America's Best Dance Crew" premiered on January 15, 2009. The season was hosted by Mario Lopez and featured Layla Kayleigh as the backstage correspondent. The judges included rapper Lil Mama, former *NSYNC singer JC Chasez, and hip-hop choreographer Shane Sparks. Chasez stated that "we'll be taking a bit more time between seasons, which will give people ample time to get their crews together, practice and prepare." This was the first season without a special casting episode. On March 5, 2009, Quest Crew was declared the winner of Season 3 and received the $100,000 (USD) prize.
Crews.
Like season 1, nine crews were selected in this season of "America's Best Dance Crew", as opposed to last season's ten crews. The nine crews were not divided into the usual four regions (East, West, Midwest, and South), but each crew's banner still listed where each crew was from. It was also the first season that showcased a crew from the Caribbean.
Team Millennia, who was eliminated during the season 2 casting special, returned this season as one of the nine official dance crews.
This season also has a heavy cross-over with "So You Think You Can Dance". Quest Crew's Ryan Conferido was a season 1 finalist, Hok and D-Trix (Dominic) were season 3 finalists. Also, clogger Brandon Norris of Dynamic Edition was heavily featured during the season 3 try-outs of "SYTYCD" and performed at the season finale. Judge Shane Sparks has also judged and choreographed for numerous seasons of "SYTYCD". Also included are the Beat Freaks, which consist of a group of professional dancers, namely Rino Nakasone, formerly of the Gwen Stefani's Harajuku Girls, and Teresa Espinosa, formerly one of Britney Spears' dancers.
Episodes.
Week 1: The Sudden Death Challenge.
JabbaWockeeZ’s Rynan Paguio aka. "Kid Rainen" temporarily guest judged in place of JC Chasez, with Chasez returning the following episode.
The crews performed to a mastermix of their choosing. The bottom three were chosen by the judges and each danced in a battle for 30 seconds each to "Live Your Life" by T.I.
Week 2: Fit Test Challenge.
Each crew was given a physical activity/exercise to incorporate into their routine.
Week 3: Britney Spears Challenge.
Similar to the Michael Jackson challenge on season 1 and the Janet Jackson and Missy Elliott challenges on season 2, the crews took inspiration from Britney Spears's music videos. Each group was also challenged to incorporate a feat in their routines that Britney included in the original video they were given. Andre Fuentes (Britney's long time choreographer) helped the crews with Britney's iconic moves.
Week 4: Whack Track Challenge.
A twist on the Dance Craze challenge in the first and second seasons, the crews had to perform to the most clichéd dance songs that started whack dance crazes. Each crew had to 
incorporate their respective song's dance in their routines, while also trying to make it look fresh.
Week 5: Illusion Challenge.
The crews had to perform their routines utilizing various magic tricks and eye-popping illusions.
Week 6: Battle of the Sexes Challenge.
The episode started off with the remaining crews doing an intro performance together choreographed by Napoleon and Tabitha D'umo.
The four crews battled it out in the Girls vs Boys style. Similar to the Video Star Challenge in the first and second seasons, each crew was given a video by a male or female superstar that emulated either 'girl power' or 'guy power', and were challenged to incorporate the spirit of the video in their choreography.
This was the first time in ABDC history that the top 4 consisted of two all male crews, and two all female crews. The male groups Quest Crew and Strikers All-Stars danced to Ludacris' What Them Girls Like, while the female groups Beat Freaks and Fly Khicks danced to Beyoncé's Single Ladies.
Week 7: Hip Hop Decathlon and Last Chance Challenge.
This week on ABDC, the crews competed against each other in two challenges: the Hip-Hop Decathlon and the Last Chance Challenge. After the mid-show elimination, then the top two crews performed to their Last Chance Challenge.
Challenge #1: Hip-Hop Decathlon.
The three remaining crews had to demonstrate their versatility by creating a routine that incorporated five different hip-hop dance styles. Although the crews performed only five styles, MTV chose to refer to the challenge as a decathlon. All crews were given the same five styles and songs, and they received help from five guest ABDC alumni from the previous two seasons. Each alumnus/alumna was assigned to one of the dance styles the crews will be responsible for. The setting in the video that the crews were supposed to watch to learn the styles was in Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory.
Challenge #2: Last Chance Challenge.
The crews created original beats to groove to during their routine for the Last Chance Challenge to show America why "they" should be crowned the winner. The remaining two crews then performed their prepared routines before the lines open for the final voting session of the season.
Week 8: The Live Finale.
The eliminated crews of season 3 returned and teamed up with the remaining two crews for the judge's choice of crews collaboration. The judges each picked three crews that complemented each other and their dance-styles.
Instead of going head-to-head, Quest Crew and Beat Freaks teamed up for their last performance.
On March 5, 2009 Quest Crew was crowned the winner of America's Best Dance Crew Season 3, while Beat Freaks was declared the runner-up.

Sixteen Days/Gathering Dust

Sixteen Days/Gathering Dust in an EP released by This Mortal Coil, a supergroup on the 4AD label, headed up by label founder and president Ivo Watts-Russell. It was released in 1983, after Ivo had tried to convince Modern English to record a medley of "Sixteen Days" and "Gathering Dust," two of the band's early songs with which they closed out their live sets. The band declined, but Ivo decided to assemble a group of musicians to record the medley. Members of Cocteau Twins, Colourbox and Modern English itself, along with vocalist Gordon Sharp of Cindytalk made up the band that recorded the title track of the EP.
Elizabeth Fraser and Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins recorded the intended b-side, a cover of Tim Buckley's "Song to the Siren." Ivo was pleased enough with the results that "Siren" was made the A-side of the 7" release.
Ivo has expressed displeasure with how the "Sixteen Days/Gathering Dust" medley turned out, and it has become somewhat of a rarity. A 4AD compilation EP, only available through the iTunes Music Store in 2006, was the only re-release of the song until it was included in a box set of all This Mortal Coil recordings, entitled "Dust And Guitars", that 4AD released in 2011.

Andy Chambers Ranch Historic District

The Andy Chambers Ranch is the only remaining nearly complete farmstead in Mormon Row, itself a historic district in Grand Teton National Park. The locale was settled by Mormon migrants between 1900 and 1920, creating an enclave near the Gros Ventre River. The farmstead dates to the 1920s and includes a house, barn, garage and a variety of outbuildings. 
The Mormon Row was a line village, similar to Grouse Creek, Utah, with a relatively dense development stretched along the line of the connecting road, allowing for extensive pasturage along either side behind the houses and buildings.
The Andy Chambers Ranch was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1990.

<doc id="18853867" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18853867" title="Tasmanian AFL bid">
Tasmanian AFL bid

The bid to establish an Australian Football League (AFL) team in the state of Tasmania has been ongoing, with fluctuating levels of support, since the then-Victorian Football League began its national expansion in the 1980s and 1990s.
The AFL's continued rejection of the Tasmanian AFL bid has raised significant controversy, with the Government of Australia launching a Senate inquiry in 2008 which AFL Commission CEO Andrew Demetriou and chairman Mike Fitzpatrick both declined to attend. At the enquiry, Tasmanian senator Kerry O'Brien brought into question the AFL's commitment to the game in Tasmania, and stated that he believed that with continued neglect, the popularity of soccer could overtake Australian rules football in Tasmania. There are already more children playing soccer than Australian rules football in Tasmania.
Background.
Although Tasmania was the third Australian state after Victoria to play the game, it has never been represented in Victorian Football League which was renamed the Australian Football League in 1990. This is despite a historically strong supporter base for Australian rules football, one of the highest participation rates in the country and strong local leagues. However, Tasmania initially held back from expressing serious interest in the VFL when there was first talk of interstate expansion.
With the relocation of the Sydney Swans and admission of teams from Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide, Tasmania belatedly began a push to enter the national competition.
Current bid.
In 2008, calls for a Tasmanian franchise has received unprecedented levels of support and media coverage with the AFL's declaration that it intends to expand the competition by creating new clubs in both the Gold Coast and Western Sydney. Many Tasmanians and traditional fans of football strongly believe that the state is more deserving of an AFL team than these other areas as Tasmania has always had strong support for football, whereas Gold Coast and Western Sydney are rugby league heartlands.
In April 2008, Tasmania's former premier Paul Lennon revived the push for an AFL team by travelling to AFL House in Melbourne to officially launch the latest bid. Although Lennon subsequently retired in May, the responsibility of steering the bid went to Economic Development Minister Paula Wriedt. The "Mercury" newspaper has also been a vocal supporter of the bid. The current bid is known as "Tassie It's Time".
Wriedt says Tasmania is only making a case for a Tasmanian team and not trying to beat the Gold Coast or Western Sydney to the 17th or 18th franchise. It is likely that Tasmania will be added later, in the case of a Melbourne club folding or merging.
AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou has said: ""They probably do deserve a team, we shouldn't dismiss the contribution that Tasmania has made to our game... They are absolutely entitled to put forward a proposal, but the commission has already decided where the 17th and 18th teams are going."" . The AFL admitted that the state had put together a strong business case, but has indicated that the next two club licences will be in Gold Coast and Western Sydney.
The bid has received a significant boost on 30 July 2008, with the announcement that the confectionery company Mars has signed on as the new club's major sponsor. The deal is reportedly worth $4 million over 3 years. It was long doubted by the AFL that the Tasmanian club would secure corporate interest before a proposal is accepted by the AFL. This announcement came as a major shock as it was before a sponsor could be found for either the Gold Coast or Western Sydney clubs and as AFL clubs Richmond and Western Bulldogs were left without a major sponsor for 2009. The Western Bulldogs have since found a major sponsor in Mission Foods.
The 2008 bid has commissioned Gemba to make a financial audit of the bid to meet the AFL criteria. In addition, the Tasmania team has secured more than 20,000 potential members, ahead of the Gold Coast and Western Sydney bids in raw numbers.
Early bids.
Between 1994 and 1997 the bid was prepared for a Tasmanian team that involved the construction of a 30,000-capacity stadium at the Hobart Showgrounds in Glenorchy, at the cost of approximately $30 million.
The stadium would have been the team's only home ground, but the appeal was unsuccessful and the stadium was not built. Thus Tasmanian bids to enter the AFL were rejected in both 1995 and 1997, when Fremantle and Port Adelaide respectively were admitted instead.
AFL arguments against a Tasmanian side.
There are a number of factors for the AFL's dismissal of Tasmanian AFL bids. However some of these arguments have an inherent conflict of interest which is noted by many commentators. As a result, the AFL's official stance has been to cite population, sponsorship interest, financial viability and regional rivalries. 
Captive market.
There are AFL figures which argue that as Tasmania is a traditional Australian football state heavily influenced by Victoria that many fans of the game have traditional VFL/AFL club allegiances which go back generations. This is especially due to high profile VFL/AFL players coming from Tasmania.
There are notable followings in Tasmania of Hawthorn, North Melbourne, St Kilda, and Collingwood. In addition, Hawthorn and North Melbourne currently playing "home" games in the state, as St.Kilda had also previously done, and have built up followings. As a result, it is argued that it may be difficult to convert these followers to support a new club that represents Tasmania. 
There is already a large television viewership in Tasmania, however the state is not counted by OzTam, relying instead on less accurate diary recording.
Population and supporter base.
The AFL has dismissed Tasmanian bids on the basis of a small and sparse population. However, existing AFL clubs also have small population catchments, but their supporter bases extend further than their regional locations. Geelong with 300,000 local people, have catchment areas with fewer people than Tasmania, which has 500,000 people. The suburb of North Melbourne, the traditional base of the North Melbourne Football Club had a population of under 10,000 in 2009, the smallest of any traditional Melbourne supporter bases. Many Melbourne based AFL clubs have had to play home games in interstate locations in order to broaden their following. 
Kevin Sheedy has argued that population is irrelevant, and that a Tasmanian side could draw support from abroad in a similar way to the Green Bay Packers.
Sponsorship interest.
Another ground for dismissing the Tasmanian bids has been a lack of sponsorship interest due in part to the location and potential supporter base. However the Tasmanian government has indicated its willingness to fill any sponsorship gap and has sponsored AFL clubs in the past. Despite the argument, the Tasmanian AFL bid was able to garner a $4 million major sponsor in Mars confectionery in 2008.
Regional rivalries and politics.
The AFL has also had past issues with the rift between north and south and regional rivalry which has caused political division within football in Tasmania. The two halves of the state have relatively equal populations and the major population centres of Hobart and Launceston each want the "home ground" to be located in their city. 
A political division and personal differences between the AFL Commission and the Tasmanian administrators (AFL Tasmania) may have also affected funding and other issues such as AFL bids. 
It is widely believed that a Tasmanian bid can only succeed if there were strong united support from both the north and south of the state.
Relocation speculation.
Some media commentators have speculated that the AFL holds Tasmania open as a soft target for relocation of struggling Melbourne clubs. Speculation has been fueled by the Kangaroos looking to shift four home games annually to Hobart's Bellerive Oval.
Past AFL relocation or merger experiences (such as the Sydney Swans and Brisbane Lions) have had mixed results which is a reason why the AFL has held off taking such a risk in Tasmania.
Senate enquiry.
The AFL have also argued that the New South Wales based participation numbers are in excess of that in Tasmania, furthering their argument that a team in Western Sydney is a higher priority. The Senate enquiry found that insurmountable cultural barriers would make such a move non-viable.

<doc id="18853916" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18853916" title="Thurlow Lieurance">
Thurlow Lieurance

Thurlow Weed Lieurance (March 21, 1878 – December 9, 1963) was an American composer, known primarily for his song "By the Waters of Minnetonka". He is frequently classed with a number of his contemporaries, including Charles Wakefield Cadman, Arthur Nevin, Charles Sanford Skilton, Preston Ware Orem, and Arthur Farwell, as a member of the Indianist movement in American music.
Life.
Lieurance was a native of Oskaloosa, Iowa, but his family relocated to Kansas when he was very young. Little is recorded about his early education; it is known that his father encouraged him to be a pharmacist, but that he preferred instead to follow a career in music. Upon the outbreak of the Spanish-American War he enlisted as a musician. With the cessation of hostilities, he moved to Ohio and enrolled in the Cincinnati College of Music, studying there until his savings from military service ran out. He was able to continue studying with Herman Bellstedt, a former cornet player under John Philip Sousa. Around 1905, Lieurance joined the Chautauqua Society, working in traveling tent schools teaching music to American Indians. The contacts he made through this position led to an interest in Indian culture; he began to try and transcribe the songs that he heard, and began to teach himself the craft of making traditional Native American flutes. At about this time polio left Lieurance disabled; though he had very little use of his legs he was quite vigorous and mobile. 
Around 1909, Lieurance acquired a portable cylinder recording device from Edison Records, and carried it with him whenever he went to visit Indian performers. In October 1911 he recorded a Crow (Apsalooke) (maybe Oglala Lakota Sioux) singer, Sitting Eagle also known as Mortimer Dreamer, then living on the Crow Reservation in Montana. From this recording he took the melody for his song "By the Waters of the Minnetonka". He set it to a harp-like accompaniment, and it was published by Theodore Presser in 1913 as "an Indian love song" with words by J. M. Cavanass, becoming an instant success and going through several editions; it was also frequently recorded in the years before 1950.
The early editions of the published arrangements in 1915, 1917, and 1921 called for a violin or flute to echo the vocal melody, playing either a provided melody or ad. lib. Possibly because of this, the melody is often played on the Native American Flute.
The performance notes from Lieurance's 1921 edition suggest:
A violin typifies the wind, if you choose, echoes the soft harmonies of the accompaniment which rocks to and fro on harp chords, between the major key and its relative minor, in and out of that singular domain musicians know as the “added Sixth” chord and its derivatives.
A typewritten note found among the composer's papers describes the legend behind the song:Moon Deer, daughter of the Moon Clan, loved Sun Deer of the Sun Clan. Tribal law forbade marriage between the two clans. It was decreed that daughters of the Moon Clan must marry into the Eagle Clan. The two lovers, in tears, ran away far to the east and north. They came to a beautiful lake called Minnetonka (Minne means water; Tonka means large and round). Their happiness was disturbed because their traditional enemies, the Chippewa, lived on the north shore of this lake. They feared to return home and be separated, and finally in desperation they decided to end it all. The legend states that they disappeared beneath the waves and were no more. The waves moaned a rhythmic sound and the pines crooned their love song.
Many moons afterwards the warriors of the Sioux drove the Chippewa north to Lake Superior. One night while they were camped on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, they heard the waters singing a weird melody and, in the moon-path on the waters, two lilies appeared and grew to the skies. The lilies were the spirits of Moon Deer and Sun Deer.
Lieurance himself recognized how important to his career the song had been, later saying that That night marked an epoch in my life, opened to me a new world. What work I have since done has been due chiefly to that song. Thousands of people have heard it, clothed with the harmonizing which our ears demand; it is lying upon music Tables all over the land, has been sung by many of the world's famous singers, including Schuman-Heink, Julia Culp and Alice Nielson.
Lieurance married, in 1917, Edna Woolley, and she took part in his recital tours thereafter. She would wear an Indian costume and play the part of "Princess Watahwaso". Such was the success of these recitals that Lieurance was able to return to school in Cincinnati, finally gaining his degree there in 1924. The couple retired from concertizing in 1926 and settled into teaching positions, working briefly at the University of Nebraska before coming to the University of Wichita. Lieurance eventually became the school's Dean of Fine Arts. The couple retired from the university in 1945.
Lieurance and his wife were invited by Theodore Presser to travel to Europe in the early 1930s. Upon their return, the composer was given support for his research into Native American music when he received a grant from the Scientific Research Society of America. Later in the decade, he helped to found the Minisa Symphony Orchestra in Wichita; most of his orchestral music was written for this group. Upon retirement, Lieurance and his wife moved to Neosho Falls, Kansas. Their house there was destroyed by flood in 1952, and the couple moved to Boulder, Colorado, where Lieurance died in 1963. Today the couple's papers may be found in the music library of Wichita State University, which has been named for the composer. Much of Lieurance's research collection is housed in the Smithsonian Institution.
Music.
Apart from "By the Waters of Minnetonka", Lieurance wrote over 300 works. Included in them were a number of orchestral pieces, with titles such as "Trails Southwest", "The Conquistadors", and "Sad Moon on Falling Leaf". Much of the rest of his output consisted of songs and works for choir, but he also composed an opera, "The Drama of Yellowstone".

Cornelius Walsh (politician)

Cornelius Walsh (1817 – September 20, 1879) was an American Republican Party politician and trunk manufacturer from New Jersey.
Walsh was born in England and emigrated to the United States with his parents as a child. He went to work at an early age, serving as an apprentice in a silver-plating business in Newark, New Jersey. He married Sarah Brown of Belleville and worked as a journeyman in Paterson.
Returning to Newark, he and his brother-in-law, William Brown, formed a partnership to manufacture trunk rivets. Walsh continued the enterprise alone and expanded his trunk business until he had a large factory with 200 employees.
He became involved in state politics, and in 1871 became a candidate for the United States Senate, opposing Cortlandt Parker and Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen for the Republican Party nomination. Despite Walsh's foreign birth, his wealth made him a formidable challenger. He bowed out of the race with the promise that he would be nominated for Governor of New Jersey later that same year. Frelinghuysen went on to win the nomination and the Senate seat.
In the 1871 gubernatorial race, Walsh faced the Democratic candidate, Joel Parker, who had previously served a term as governor from 1863 to 1866. Parker defeated Walsh by a margin of six thousand votes.
Walsh's defeat led to a decline in his business fortunes, and he lost most of his previous wealth. He died in 1879 at his home in Newark.

Bar B C Dude Ranch

The Bar B C Dude Ranch was established near Moose, Wyoming in 1912 as a dude ranch by Struthers Burt and Dr. Horace Carncross, using their initials as the brand. Rather than converting a working ranch, Burt and Carncross built a tourist-oriented dude ranch from the ground up, using a style called "Dude Ranch Vernacular", which featured log construction and rustic detailing. As one of the first dude ranches in Jackson Hole, the Bar B C was a strong influence on other dude ranches in the area, and employed a number of people who went on to establish their own operations. It was acquired by the National Park Service and incorporated into Grand Teton National Park upon the expiration of a life estate. The ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
History.
Struthers Burt had previously started the first true dude ranch in Jackson Hole, the JY, in 1908 with Louis Joy. The JY's patrons included Owen Wister, whose writings did much to popularize dude ranches. However, Joy and Burt fell out. Established in 1912 by Burt and Horace Carncross, the B C was given a boost by the outbreak of World War I, which restricted American travel to Europe. Many Easterners came west, and Jackson Hole was particularly popular among Philadelphians. In 1917 Burt and Carncross borrowed $9200 to expand the ranch from the Philadelphia Trust Company. The standard of service and cuisine rose rapidly (Burt described early food as "bad"), moving from canned vegetables in the early years to fresh vegetables and dairy produced at the ranch by the early 1920s. By 1922 it was incorporated as Bar B C Ranches and was one of the largest operations in the valley, able to house fifty dudes in 45 buildings. Burt and Carncross also operated the White Grass for Harold Hammond and George Bispham during this time, briefly buying the White Grass operation before selling it back. New partners Irving Corse and Joe LePage joined the operation, having worked their way through the organization as cowboys, wranglers and foremen.
The B C site was carefully selected by Burt and Carncross after considering views, water, soil, timber, and a relative lack of mosquitoes. Carncross, a 41-year old physician from Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, hoped that the dude ranch business would lead to a cattle ranching operation. Rather than buying an existing operation, Burt and Carncross established the B C as a homestead claim on adjacent tracts of for Burt and for Carncross, claiming more land in subsequent years. By 1917 the B C amounted to more than . In 1924 Burt and Carncross bought a ranch near the Gros Ventre River to raise cattle and hay, naming it the Lower Bar BC.
In 1924, Burt published "Diary of a Dude Wrangler" in the "Saturday Evening Post". Burt was himself a Princeton-educated Easterner who wrote on a wide range of subjects, including the West. Burt's wife, Katharine Newlin Burt (1882–1977) and son Nathaniel Burt (1913–2003) were also published writers. Consequently, the Bar B C tended to attract writers. Guests included Harry W. Frantz and Burt's friends from Princeton, including David Adler.
During the 1920s Burt became an active advocate for conservation in Jackson Hole, opposing plans to build a dam at the outlet of Jenny Lake. In 1923 Burt participated in a meeting with Horace Albright, director of the National Park Service, at Maud Noble's cabin at Menor's Ferry, which established a plan for the protection of Jackson Hole. After 1927 the Snake River Land Company, operating on behalf of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., began to buy Jackson Hole land for eventual transfer to the National Park Service. In 1929 Burt and his then-partner Irving Corse sold the Bar B C in return for a life estate that allowed the dude operation to continue. Carncross had died in 1928 at his home in Pennsylvania, soon followed by Joe LePage. Grand Teton National Park was established in 1929, encompassing the Teton Range. It would not be until 1943, when Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed Jackson Hole National Monument, assembled largely from Snake River Land Company holdings, that the ranch would exist within the protected lands. In 1929, Burt bought land along Pacific Creek where he established a dude ranch-like private retreat, naming it Three Rivers Ranch.
During the 1930s Burt and Corse disagreed over management and profit sharing, and in 1937 Corse bought out Burt. Corse believed that authenticity demanded that the ranch look "run down", and neglected maintenance. A series of fires caused some necessary rebuilding, and in 1934 Corse moved Joe LePage's cabin to the ranch. Corse also built a small airstrip and hangar on the property. During World War II Corse suspended the ranch operation to be a flight instructor at the University of Wyoming. After the war, Corse's health declined, and he died in 1953. Margaretta Corse subleased the ranch to T.H. and Margaretta Frew Conderman (of the 4 Lazy F Dude Ranch Frews), who operated the ranch as short-term-stay tourist cabins from 1950 to 1959. Afterwards, Mrs. Corse managed the ranch until 1985, when she could no longer continue. Mrs. Corse died in 1988. The life estate was terminated, and the property reverted to the Park Service.
Description.
The historic district at the Bar B C includes 37 structures, including cabins, a lodge, a dining hall, a laundry/utility building, man-made ponds, barns, sheds and corrals. The site is at the western edge of the Snake River bottomlands, nestled against a river terrace to the west. A central road climbs from the ranch through a cutting in the hillside. The buildings are chiefly 1- or -story log structures, rectangular in shape. Roofing is red or green asphalt roll roofing. The property layout is apparently casual, but centers on the dining hall and lodge, with cabins on either side of the main path, flanked by corrals to the north and the barn to the south. While the exteriors are in good condition and are considered contributing features, the interiors have lost much of their character through alterations and loss of fixtures.
The informally styled ranch was widely copied by later dude ranches, and is considered a prototype of the genre.
Offspring.
As one of the first dude ranches in the area, the B C inspired former dudes and employees to establish their own operations. Bar B C alumni established the White Grass, Sun Star, and the STS Ranch. Others, such as Maud Noble, who bought Menor's Ferry, or Cissy Patterson, established personal retreats.
The ranch operated until after World War II, when the cabins became summer rental cabins.
Present situation.
The main ranch is included in Grand Teton National Park. The buildings have received limited maintenance since 1986. Many structures have deteriorated, and some have been partially demolished, but preservation work, coordinated from the National Trust for Historic Preservation Western Center at the White Grass Ranch, has stabilized the Carncross Cabin and the main lodge. The Bar B C was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1990.
A residential property development on the former Lower B C Ranch property, just south of the Three Rivers Ranch, is now called the Bar BC Ranch.

Mount Senjō

Outline.
Mount Senjō is one of the destinations in Akaishi Mountains for tourists. This mountain has three major peaks, which are Senjō-ga-take, Dai-Senjō-ga-take, and Ko-Senjō-ga-take. 
This mountain can be accessed easily over Minami Alps Gravel Road. This mountain is called 'the queen of Minami-Alps' because of its elegant looks. This area is in Minami Alps National Park that was established on June 1, 1964.
Mountaineering.
British Walter Weston visited Japan several times and wrote in 1896 the book "Mountaineering and Exploring in the Japanese Alps". He climbed Mount Senjō in 1904.
Route.
The most popular route to the top of this mountain is from Kitazawa Pass. To the Kitazawa Pass, climbers use buses from Todai-guchi Bus Stop or Hirogawara Bus Stop. It takes about four hours from the pass to the mountain.
Mountain hut and camp site.
There are some mountain huts in the surrounding, and they are opened during the climbing mountain season. There is a "Mountin hut Senjō" in the Yambusawa Cirque near the top of the mountain. Moreover, there is one camp specification ground. That is the large one around "Kitazawa Pass (北沢峠)" that is used as base camp for Mount Senjō or Mount Kaikoma.
Alpine plants and animals.
This mountain is famous for many Alpine plants on the upper part of the mountains above the tree line. Siberian Dwarf Pine can be see in the place and Rock Ptarmigan and Spotted Nutcracker live here as well. Japanese Serow and Sika Deer live in the forest belt in the hillside in the mountain. Then this mountain is selected to " 100 famous Mountains with flowers" and "New 100 famous Mountains with flowers" by Sumie Tanaka.
Geography.
Nearby mountains.
It is on the main ridge line in the northern part of the Akaishi Mountains. There are three cirques: "Yabusawa", "Ko-Senjō" and "Dai-Senjō". The ridge on the north side is called "Horseback" ("Uma-no-Se").
Source of river.
Rivers with their source here flow to the Pacific Ocean.

Jedwabne Synagogue

The Jedwabne Synagogue, (), located in Jedwabne, Poland, was built in 1770. It was an example of the unique Polish Jewish architectural tradition of building large, domed wooden synagogues. The layered, pitched roof visible in surviving exterior photographs conceals a series of massive trusses from which the great dome is suspended. The roof, which features three well-defined stages, is considered one of the most architecturally complex and interesting of wooden synagogue roofs. The synagogue was enlarged in the nineteenth century by the addition of one story extensions on each side for the use of the women of the community.
The synagogue was destroyed in an accidental fire in 1913.
Immigrants from Jedwabne built the synagogue Congregation Anshe Yedwabne at 242 Henry Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of New York City.

North American P-51 variants

The North American Aviation P-51 Mustang was an American long-range, single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber used by Allied air forces during World War II, the Korean War and in several other conflicts. During World War II Mustang pilots claimed 4,950 enemy aircraft shot down, second only to the Grumman F6F Hellcat.
The P-51 was conceived, designed and built by North American Aviation (NAA), under the direction of lead engineer Edgar Schmued, in response to a specification issued directly to NAA by the British Purchasing Commission; the prototype NA-73X airframe was rolled out on 9 September 1940, albeit without an engine, 102 days after the contract was signed and it was first flown on 26 October. The Mustang was originally designed to use a low-altitude rated Allison V-1710 engine, and was first flown operationally by the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a tactical-reconnaissance aircraft and fighter-bomber. The definitive version, the P-51D, was powered by the Packard V-1650-7, a licence-built version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin 60 series two-stage two-speed supercharged engine, and armed with six .50 caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns. This article covers the various variants of the P-51.
Allison-engined Mustangs.
Mustang Mk I(NA-73).
The first production contract was awarded by the British for 320 NA-73 fighters, named Mustang Mk I by an anonymous member of the British Purchasing Commission; a second British contract soon followed, which called for 300 more (NA-83) Mustang Mk I fighters. Contractual arrangements were also made for two aircraft from the first order to be delivered to the USAAC for evaluation; these two airframes, 41-038 and 41-039 respectively, were designated XP-51. The first RAF Mustang Mk Is were delivered to 26 Squadron at RAF Gatwick in February 1942 and made their combat debut on 10 May 1942. With their long range and excellent low-altitude performance, they were employed effectively for tactical reconnaissance and ground-attack duties over the English Channel, but were thought to be of limited value as fighters due to their poor performance above .
P-51/Mustang IA (NA-91).
The first American order for 150 P-51s, designated NA-91 by North American, were placed by the Army on 7 July 1940. The two XP-51s (41-038 and 41-039) set aside for testing arrived at Wright Field on 24 August and 16 December 1941 respectively. The relatively small size of this first order reflected the fact that the USAAC was still a relatively small, underfunded peacetime organisation. After the attack on Pearl Harbor priority had to be given to building as many of the existing fighters - P-38s, P-39s and P-40s - as possible while simultaneously training pilots and other personnel, which meant that the evaluation of the XP-51s did not begin immediately. However, this did not mean that the XP-51s were neglected, or their testing and evaluation mishandled. The 150 NA-91s were designated P-51 by the newly formed USAAF and were initially named Apache, although this was soon dropped, and the RAF name, Mustang, adopted instead. The USAAF did not like the mixed armament of the British Mustang Is and instead adopted an armament of four long-barrelled 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano Mk II cannon, and deleted the .50 cal engine cowling mounted weapons. The British designated this model as Mustang Mk IA. A number of aircraft from this lot were fitted out by the USAAF as F-6A photo-reconnaissance aircraft. The British would fit a number of Mustang Mk Is with similar equipment, like machine guns.
It was quickly evident that the Mustang's performance, although exceptional up to , was markedly reduced at higher altitudes. The single-speed, single-stage supercharger fitted to the Allison V-1710 engine had been designed to produce its maximum power at a low altitude. Above 15,000 feet, the supercharger's critical altitude rating, the power dropped off rapidly. Prior to the Mustang project, the USAAC had Allison concentrate primarily on turbochargers in concert with General Electric; the turbochargers proved to be reliable and capable of providing significant power increases in the P-38 Lightning and other high-altitude aircraft, in particular in the Air Corps's four-engine bombers. Most of the other uses for the Allison were for low-altitude designs, where a simpler supercharger would suffice. Fitting a turbocharger into the Mustang proved impractical, and Allison was forced to use the only supercharger that was available. In spite of this, the Mustang's advanced aerodynamics showed to advantage, as the Mustang Mk I was about faster than contemporary Curtiss P-40 fighters using the same engine (the V-1710-39 producing at , driving a diameter, three-blade Curtiss-Electric propeller). The Mustang Mk I was faster than the Spitfire Mk VC at and faster at , despite the British aircraft's more powerful engine.
Although it has often been stated that the poor performance of the Allison engine above was a surprise and disappointment to the RAF and USAAF, this has to be regarded as a myth; aviation engineers of the time were fully capable of correctly assessing the performance of an aircraft's engine and supercharger. As evidence of this, in mid-1941, the 93rd and 102nd airframes from the NA-91 order were slated to be set aside and fitted and tested with Packard Merlin engines, with each receiving the designation XP-51B.
P-51A/Mustang II (NA-99).
On 23 June 1942, a contract was placed for 1,200 P-51As (NA-99s). The P-51A used the new Allison V-1710-81 engine, a development of the V-1710-39, driving a diameter three-bladed Curtiss-Electric propeller. The armament was changed to four wing-mounted .50 in (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns, two in each wing, with a maximum of 350 rounds per gun (rpg) for the inboard guns and 280 rpg for the outboard. Other improvements were made in parallel with the A-36, including an improved, fixed air duct inlet replacing the movable fitting of previous Mustang models and the fitting of wing racks able to carry either 75 or 150 U.S. gal (284 or 568 l) drop tanks, increasing the maximum ferry range to 2,740 mi (4,410 km) with the 150 gal (568 l) tanks. The top speed was raised to at . A total of 50 aircraft were shipped to England, serving as Mustang Mk IIs in the RAF.
A-36 Apache/Invader (NA-97).
On 16 April 1942, Fighter Project Officer Benjamin S. Kelsey ordered 500 A-36 Apaches, a redesign that included six .50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns, dive brakes, and the ability to carry two 500 lb (230 kg) bombs. Kelsey would rather have bought more fighters but was willing instead to initiate a higher level of Mustang production at North American by using USAAC funds earmarked for ground-attack aircraft when pursuit aircraft funding had already been allocated.
The 500 were designated A-36A (NA-97). This model became the first USAAF Mustang to see combat. One aircraft ("EW998") was passed to the British who gave it the name Mustang Mk I (Dive Bomber).
Merlin-engined Mustangs.
Mustang X.
In April 1942, the RAF's Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU) tested the Mustang and found its performance inadequate at higher altitudes. As such, it was to be used to replace the Tomahawk in Army Cooperation Command squadrons, but the commanding officer was so impressed with its maneuverability and low-altitude speeds that he invited Ronnie Harker from Rolls-Royce's Flight Test establishment to fly it. Rolls-Royce engineers rapidly realized that equipping the Mustang with a Merlin 61 engine with its two-speed two-stage supercharger would substantially improve performance and started converting five aircraft as the Mustang Mk X. Apart from the engine installation, which utilized custom-built engine bearers designed by Rolls-Royce and a standard diameter, four-bladed Rotol propeller from a Spitfire Mk IX, the Mustang Mk X was a straightforward adaptation of the Mustang Mk I airframe, keeping the same radiator duct design. The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sir Wilfrid R. Freeman, lobbied vociferously for Merlin-powered Mustangs, insisting two of the five experimental Mustang Mk Xs be handed over to Carl Spaatz for trials and evaluation by the U.S. 8th Air Force in Britain. The high-altitude performance improvement was remarkable: the Mustang Mk X (serial number AM208) reached 433 mph (697 km/h) at , and "AL975" tested at an absolute ceiling of .
P-51B and P-51C.
The two XP-51Bs were a more thorough conversion than the Mustang X, with a tailor-made engine installation and a complete redesign of the radiator duct. The airframe itself was strengthened, with the fuselage and engine mount area receiving more formers because of the greater weight of the Packard V-1650-3, , compared with the Allison V-1710's . The engine cowling was completely redesigned to house the Packard Merlin, which, because of the intercooler radiator mounted on the supercharger casing, was taller and used an updraught induction system, rather than the downdraught carburetor of the Allison. The new engine drove a four-bladed diameter Hamilton Standard propeller that featured cuffs of hard molded rubber. To cater for the increased cooling requirements of the Merlin, a new fuselage duct was designed. This housed a larger radiator, which incorporated a section for the supercharger coolant, and, forward of this and slightly lower, an oil cooler was housed in a secondary duct which drew air through the main opening and exhausted via a separate exit flap.
A "duct rumble" heard by pilots in flight in the prototype P-51B resulted in a full-scale wind-tunnel test at NACA Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. This was carried out by inserting the airplane, with the outer wing panels removed, into the 16-foot wind tunnel. A test engineer would sit in the cockpit with the wind tunnel running and listen for the duct rumble. It was eventually found that the rumble could be eliminated by increasing the gap between the lower surface of the wing and the upper lip of the cooling system duct from 1 inch to 2 inches. The conclusion was that part of the boundary layer on the lower surface of the wing was being ingested into the inlet and separating, causing the radiator to vibrate and producing the rumble. The inlet that went into production on the P-51B was lowered even further to give a separation of 2.63 inches from the bottom of the wing. In addition, the shelf that extended above the oil cooler face was removed and the inlet highlight was swept back.
It was decided that new P-51B (NA-102) would continue with the four wing-mounted .50 in (12.7 mm) M2/AN Browning machine guns (with 350 rpg for the inboard guns and 280 rpg for the outboard) first used in the P-51A, while the bomb rack/external drop tank installation was adapted from the A-36 Apache; the racks were rated to be able to carry up to of ordnance and were also capable of carrying drop tanks. The weapons were aimed using the electrically illuminated N-3B reflector sight fitted with an A-1 head assembly which allowed it to be used as a gun or bomb sight through varying the angle of the reflector glass. Pilots were also given the option of having ring and bead sights mounted on the top engine cowling formers. This option was discontinued with the later P-51Ds.
The first XP-51B flew on 30 November 1942. Flight tests confirmed the potential of the new fighter, with the service ceiling being raised by 10,000 feet, with the top speed improving by 50 mph at . American production was started in early 1943 with the P-51B (NA-102) being manufactured at Inglewood, California, and the P-51C (NA-103) at a new plant in Dallas, Texas, which was in operation by summer 1943. The RAF named these models Mustang Mk III. In performance tests, the P-51B reached 441 mph (709.70 km/h) at . In addition, the extended range made possible by the use of drop tanks enabled the Merlin-powered Mustang to be introduced as a bomber escort with a combat radius of 750 miles using two 75 gal tanks.
The range would be further increased with the introduction of an 85 gal (322 l) self-sealing fuel tank aft of the pilot's seat, starting with the P-51B-5-NA series. When this tank was full, the center of gravity of the Mustang was moved dangerously close to the aft limit. As a result, maneuvers were restricted until the tank was down to about 25 U.S. gal (95 l) and the external tanks had been dropped. Problems with high-speed "porpoising" of the P-51Bs and P-51Cs with the fuselage tanks would lead to the replacement of the fabric-covered elevators with metal-covered surfaces and a reduction of the tailplane incidence. With the fuselage and wing tanks, plus two 75 gal drop tanks, the combat radius was now 880 miles.
Despite these modifications, the P-51Bs and P-51Cs, and the newer P-51Ds and P-51Ks, experienced low-speed handling problems that could result in an involuntary "snap-roll" under certain conditions of air speed, angle of attack, gross weight, and center of gravity. Several crash reports tell of P-51Bs and P-51Cs crashing because horizontal stabilizers were torn off during maneuvering. As a result of these problems, a modification kit consisting of a dorsal fin was manufactured. One report stated:
"Unless a dorsal fin is installed on the P-51B, P-51C and P-51D airplanes, a snap roll may result when attempting a slow roll. The horizontal stabilizer will not withstand the effects of a snap roll. To prevent recurrence, the stabilizer should be reinforced in accordance with T.O. 01-60J-18 dated 8 April 1944 and a dorsal fin should be installed. Dorsal fin kits are being made available to overseas activities"
The dorsal fin kits became available in August 1944, and were fitted to P-51Bs and P-51Cs, and to P-51Ds and P-51Ks. Also incorporated was a change to the rudder trim tabs, which would help prevent the pilot over-controlling the aircraft and creating heavy loads on the tail unit.
One of the few remaining complaints with the Merlin-powered aircraft was a poor rearward view. The canopy structure, which was the same as the Allison-engined Mustangs, was made up of flat, framed panels; the pilot gained access, or exited the cockpit by lowering the port side panel and raising the top panel to the right. The canopy could not be opened in flight and tall pilots especially, were hampered by limited headroom. In order to at least partially improve the view from the Mustang, the British had field-modified some Mustangs with clear, sliding canopies called Malcolm hoods (designed by Robert Malcolm), and whose design had also been adopted by the U.S. Navy's own F4U-1D version of the Corsair in April 1944.
The new structure was a frameless plexiglas moulding which ballooned outwards at the top and sides, increasing the headroom and allowing increased visibility to the sides and rear. Because the new structure slid backward on runners, it could be slid open in flight. The aerial mast behind the canopy was replaced by a "whip" aerial which was mounted further aft and offset to the right. Most British Mk IIIs were equipped with Malcolm hoods. Several American service groups "acquired" the necessary conversion kits and some American P-51B/P-51Cs appeared with the new canopy, although the majority continued to use the original framed canopies.
P-51Bs and P-51Cs started to arrive in England in August and October 1943. The P-51B/P-51C versions were sent to 15 fighter groups that were part of the 8th and 9th Air Forces in England and the 12th and 15th in Italy (the southern part of Italy was under Allied control by late 1943). Other deployments included the China Burma India Theater (CBI).
Allied strategists quickly exploited the long-range fighter as a bomber escort. It was largely due to the P-51 that daylight bombing raids deep into German territory became possible without prohibitive bomber losses in late 1943.
A number of the P-51B and P-51C aircraft were fitted for photo reconnaissance and designated F-6C.
P-51D and P-51K.
Following combat experience the P-51D series introduced a "teardrop", or "bubble", canopy to rectify problems with poor visibility to the rear of the aircraft. In America, new moulding techniques had been developed to form streamlined nose transparencies for bombers. North American designed a new streamlined plexiglass canopy for the P-51B which was later developed into the teardrop shaped bubble canopy. In late 1942, the tenth production P-51B-1-NA was removed from the assembly lines. From the windshield aft the fuselage was redesigned by cutting down the rear fuselage formers to the same height as those forward of the cockpit; the new shape faired in to the vertical tail unit. A new simpler style of windscreen, with an angled bullet-resistant windscreen mounted on two flat side pieces improved the forward view while the new canopy resulted in exceptional all-round visibility. Wind tunnel tests of a wooden model confirmed that the aerodynamics were sound.
The new model Mustang also had a redesigned wing; alterations to the undercarriage up-locks and inner-door retracting mechanisms meant that there was an additional fillet added forward of each of the wheel bays, increasing the wing area and creating a distinctive "kink" at the inner leading edges. Most significant was a deepening of the wing to the allow the guns to be mounted upright, resulting in a slightly reduced maximum speed compared to P-51B/C variants.
Other alterations to the wings included new navigation lights, mounted on the wingtips, rather than the smaller lights above and
below the wings of the earlier Mustangs, and retractable landing lights which were mounted at the back of the wheel wells; these replaced the lights which had been formally mounted in the wing leading edges.
The armament was increased with the addition of two more .50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns, bringing the total to six. The inner pair of machine guns had 400 rpg, and the others had 270 rpg, for a total of 1,880. In previous P-51s, the M2s were mounted at large angle to allow access to the feed chutes from the ammunition trays. This angled mounting had caused problems with the ammunition feed and with spent casings and links failing to clear the gun-chutes, leading to frequent complaints that the guns jammed during combat maneuvers. The new arrangement allowed the M2s to be mounted upright, remedying most of the jamming problems. In addition the weapons were installed along the line of the wing's dihedral, rather than parallel to the ground line as in the earlier Mustangs.
The wing racks fitted to the P-51D/P-51K series were strengthened and were able to carry up to of ordnance, although bombs were the recommended maximum load. Later models had removable under-wing 'Zero Rail' rocket pylons added to carry up to ten T64 5.0 in (127 mm) H.V.A.R rockets per plane. The gunsight was changed from the N-3B to the N-9 before the introduction in September 1944 of the K-14 or K-14A gyro-computing sight. Apart from these changes, the P-51D and K series retained V-1650-7 engine used in the majority of the P-51B/C series.
The addition of the 85 U.S gallon (322 l) fuselage fuel tank, coupled with the reduction in area of the new rear fuselage, exacerbated the handling problems already experienced with the B/C series when fitted with the tank, and led to a fillet being added to the base of the vertical tailfin. P-51Ds without fuselage fuel tanks were fitted with either the SCR-522-A or SCR-274-N Command Radio sets and SCR-695-A, or SCR-515 radio transmitters, as well as an AN/APS-13 rear-warning set; P-51Ds and Ks with fuselage tanks used the SCR-522-A and AN/APS-13 only.
The P-51D became the most widely produced variant of the Mustang. During 1945–48, P-51Ds were also built under licence in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation. A Dallas-built version of the P-51D, designated the P-51K, was equipped with an diameter Aeroproducts propeller in place of the Hamilton Standard propeller. The hollow-bladed Aeroproducts propeller was unreliable, due to manufacturing problems, with dangerous vibrations at full throttle and was eventually replaced by the Hamilton Standard.
By the time of the Korean War, most F-51s were equipped with "uncuffed" Hamilton Standard propellers with wider, blunt-tipped blades. 
The photo reconnaissance versions of the P-51D and P-51K were designated F-6D and F-6K respectively. The RAF assigned the name Mustang Mk IV to the P-51D model and Mustang Mk IVA to P-51K models.
The P-51D/P-51K started arriving in Europe in mid-1944 and quickly became the primary USAAF fighter in the theater. It was produced in larger numbers than any other Mustang variant. Nevertheless, by the end of the war, roughly half of all operational Mustangs were still P-51B or P-51C models.
Australian Production.
In November 1944 the Australian government decided to order Australian-built Mustangs, to replace its Curtiss Kittyhawks and CAC Boomerangs in the South West Pacific theatre. The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) factory at Fishermans Bend, Melbourne was the only non-U.S. production line for the P-51.
In 1944, 100 P-51Ds were shipped from the U.S. in kit form to inaugurate production. From February 1945, CAC assembled 80 of these under the designation CA-17 Mustang Mark 20, with the first Australian-built aircraft flying on the 29 April 1945 and the first aircraft was handed over to the RAAF on 31 May 1945. The remaining 20 were kept unassembled as spare parts. In addition, 84 P-51Ks were also shipped directly to the RAAF from the USA.
In late 1946, CAC was given another contract to build 170 (reduced to 120) more P-51Ds on its own; these, designated CA-18 Mustang Mark 21, Mark 22 or Mark 23, were manufactured entirely in-house, with only a few components being sourced from overseas. The 21 and 22 used the American-built Packard V-1650-3 or V-1650-7. The Mark 23s, which followed the 21s, were powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 or Merlin 70 engines. The first 26 were built as Mark 21s, followed by 66 Mark 23s; the first 14 Mark 21s were converted to fighter-reconnaissance aircraft, with two F24 cameras in both vertical and oblique positions in the rear fuselage, above and behind the radiator fairing; the designation of these modified Mustangs was changed from Mark 21 to Mark 22. An additional 14 purpose-built Mark 22s, built after the Mark 23s, and powered by either Packard V-1650-7s or Merlin 68s, completed the production run. All of the CA-17s and CA-18s, plus the 84 P-51Ks, used Australian serial numbers prefixed by A68.
After the USAF cancelled orders for P-51H variants, the RAAF followed suit, cancelling 250 locally-built versions, which CAC had assigned the designation CA-21.
The "lightweight" Mustangs.
XP-51F, XP-51G and XP-51J.
The lightweight Mustangs had an all-new wing design. The wing airfoils were switched to the NACA 66,2-(1.8)15.5 a=.6 at the root and the NACA NACA 66,2-(1.8)12 a=.6 at the tip. These airfoils were designed to give more low-drag laminar flow than the previous NAA/NACA 45-100 airfoils. In addition, the wing planform was a simple trapezoid, with no leading extension in the wing root region.
In 1943, North American submitted a proposal to redesign the P-51D as model NA-105, which was accepted by the USAAF. Modifications included changes to the cowling, a simplified undercarriage with smaller wheels and disc brakes, and a larger canopy and an armament of four .50 Brownings. In total the design was some 1,600 pounds lighter than the P-51D. In test flights the XP-51F achieved at 21,000 feet. The designation XP-51F was assigned to prototypes powered with V-1650 engines (a small number of XP-51Fs were passed to the British as the Mustang V), and XP-51G to those with reverse lend/lease Merlin RM 14 SM engines.
A third lightweight prototype powered by an Allison V-1710-119 engine was added to the development program. This aircraft was designated XP-51J. Since the engine was insufficiently developed, the XP-51J was loaned to Allison for engine development. None of these experimental lightweights went into production.
P-51H.
The P-51H (NA-126) was the final production Mustang, embodying the experience gained in the development of the XP-51F and XP-51G aircraft. This aircraft, with minor differences as the NA-129, came too late to participate in World War II, but it brought the development of the Mustang to a peak as one of the fastest production piston-engine fighters to see service.
The P-51H used the new V-1650-9 engine, a version of the Merlin that included Simmons automatic supercharger boost control with water injection, allowing War Emergency Power as high as 2,218 hp (1,500 kW). Differences between the P-51D included lengthening the fuselage and increasing the height of the tailfin, which greatly reduced the tendency to yaw. The canopy resembled the P-51D style, over a raised pilot's position. Service access to the guns and ammunition was also improved. With the new airframe several hundred pounds lighter, the extra power and a more streamlined radiator, the P-51H was among the fastest propeller fighters ever, able to reach 487 mph (784 km/h or Mach 0.74) at 25,000 ft (7,600 m).
The P-51H was designed to complement the P-47N as the primary aircraft for the invasion of Japan, with 2,000 ordered to be manufactured at Inglewood. Production was just ramping up with 555 delivered when the war ended.
Additional orders, already on the books, were canceled. With the cutback in production, the variants of the P-51H with different versions of the Merlin engine were produced in either limited numbers or terminated. These included the P-51L, similar to the P-51H but utilizing the V-1650-11 engine, which was never built; and its Dallas-built version, the P-51M, or NA-124, which utilized the V-1650-9A engine lacking water injection and therefore rated for lower maximum power, of which one was built out of the original 1629 ordered, serial number 45-11743.
Although some P-51Hs were issued to operational units, none saw combat in World War II, and in postwar service, most were issued to reserve units. One aircraft was provided to the RAF for testing and evaluation. Serial number "44-64192" was designated BuNo "09064" and used by the U.S. Navy to test transonic airfoil designs and then returned to the Air National Guard in 1952. The P-51H was not used for combat in the Korean War despite its improved handling characteristics, since the P-51D was available in much larger numbers and was a proven commodity.
Many of the aerodynamic advances of the P-51 (including the laminar flow wing) were carried over to North American's next generation of jet-powered fighters, the Navy FJ Fury and Air Force F-86 Sabre. The wings, empennage and canopy of the first straight-winged variant of the Fury (the FJ-1) and the unbuilt preliminary prototypes of the P-86/F-86 strongly resembled those of the Mustang before the aircraft were modified with swept-wing designs.
Experimental Mustangs.
In early 1944, the first P-51A-1-NA, "43-6003". was fitted and tested with a lightweight retractable ski kit replacing the wheels. This conversion was made in response to a perceived requirement for aircraft that would operate away from prepared airstrips. The main oleo leg fairings were retained, but the main wheel doors and tail wheel doors were removed for the tests. When the undercarriage was retracted, the main gear skis were housed in the space in the lower engine compartment made available by the removal of the fuselage .50 in (12.7 mm) Brownings from the P-51As. The entire installation added to the aircraft weight and required that the operating pressure of the hydraulic system had to be increased from 1,000 psi (6,897 kPa) to 1,200 psi (8,276 kPa). Flight tests showed that ground handling was good, and the Mustang could take off and land in a field length of ; the maximum speed was lower, although it was thought that fairings over the retracted skis would compensate.
Concern over the USAAF's inability to escort B-29s all the way to mainland Japan resulted in the highly classified "Seahorse" project (NAA-133), an effort to "navalize" the P-51. On 15 November 1944, naval aviator (and later test pilot) Lieutenant Bob Elder, in a P-51D-5-NA "44-14017", started flight tests from the deck of the carrier . This Mustang had been fitted with an arrestor hook, which was attached to a reinforced bulkhead behind the tail wheel opening; the hook was housed in a streamlined position under the rudder fairing and could be released from the cockpit. The tests showed that the Mustang could be flown off the carrier deck without the aid of a catapult, using a flap setting of 20° down and 5° of up elevator. Landings were found to be easy, and, by allowing the tail wheel to contact the deck before the main gear, the aircraft could be stopped in a minimum distance. The project was canceled after U.S. Marines secured the Japanese island of Iwo Jima and its airfields, making it possible for standard P-51D models to accompany B-29s all the way to the Japanese home islands and back.
While North American were concentrating on improving the performance of the P-51 through the development of the lightweight Mustangs, in Britain, other avenues of development were being pursued. To this end, two Mustang Mk IIIs (P-51Bs and P-51Cs), "FX858" and "FX901", were fitted with different Merlin engine variants. The first of these, "FX858", was fitted with a Merlin 100 by Rolls-Royce at Hucknall; this engine was similar to the RM 14 SM fitted to the XP-51G and was capable of generating 2,080 hp (1,550 kW) at 22,800 ft (7,000 m) using a boost pressure of +25 lbf/in2 (170 kPa; 80 inHg) in war emergency setting. With this engine, "FX858" reached a maximum speed of 453 mph (729 km/h) at 18,000 ft (5,500 m), and this could be maintained to 25,000 ft (7,600 m). The climb rate was 4,160 ft/min (21.1 m/s) at 14,000 ft (4,300 m).
"FX901" was fitted with a Merlin 113 (also used in the de Havilland Mosquito B. Mk 35). This engine was similar to the Merlin 100, but it was fitted with a supercharger rated for higher altitudes. "FX901" was capable of 454 mph (730 km/h) at 30,000 ft (9,100 m) and at 40,000 ft (12,200 m).
P-51 Mustang Dimensions, performance and armament.
The basic dimensions of the P-51/A-36 variants remained consistent from the XP-51 through to the experimental "lightweight" P-51s, although there were relatively minor variations in height and wing areas. The P-51H was the first production version of the Mustang to feature a lengthened fuselage and taller tailfin.
Power ratings.
The power rating for the engines could vary according to the type of supercharger fitted, the size of the compressor impeller(s) and the gear speeds selected. 
In the case of the Packard Merlin V-1650s, used from the P-51B on, two sets of power ratings can be quoted because these engines were fitted with two-stage, two-speed superchargers; the maximum power generated by the V-1650-3 was 1,490 hp (1,111 kW) at 13,750 ft ("critical altitude") (4,191 m) in "low blower" using of Mercury "boost"; i.e. 61" Hg. The "boost" is the pressure to which the air–fuel mixture is compressed before being fed through to the engine's cylinders (manifold pressure). Because air pressure and air density decrease with altitude the efficiency of a piston engine drops because of the reduction in the amount of air that can be drawn into the engine; for example the air density at is ⅓ of that at sea level, thus only ⅓ of the amount of air can be drawn into the cylinder and only ⅓ of the fuel can be burnt.
In the case of the Mustang the air being forced through the supercharger air intake was first compressed by the supercharger's first stage, or "low blower". The intercooler stopped the compressed mixture from becoming too hot and either igniting before reaching the cylinders, or creating a condition known as knocking.
Two-stage refers to the use of two impellorson a common driveshaft in effect constituting two superchargers in series; a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor injected fuel at 5 psi through a nozzle direct into the supercharger where the first-stage impellor compressed the air/fuel mixture. This was then fed to the smaller second-stage impellor which further compressed the mixture. The impellors were driven by a hydraulically operated two-speed gearbox. At low to medium altitudes, the supercharger was in "Low Blower" (this referred to the speed at which the impellors were operating). Once the aircraft reached and climbed through the set critical altitude (20,000 ft/6,096 m for the -3) the power would start to drop as the atmospheric pressure, hence the weight of air dropped. As the critical altitude was passed a pressure-operated aneroid capsule operated the gearbox which changed up to "High Blower" driving the impellors faster, thus compressing a greater volume of the air-fuel mixture. This second stage blower required approximately 200 hp (149 kW) to drive it. As a result, the maximum power generated by the V-1650-3 in "high blower" was 1,210 hp (902 kW) at 25,800 ft (7,863 m), using 61" Hg. 
The V-1650-7 used in later P-51B/Cs and in the P-51D/K produced slightly more power but, because of the use of slightly different gear ratios for the impellers, the critical altitude ratings of the supercharger stages were lower, 8,500 ft (2,590 m) and 21,400 ft (6,523 m) respectively. Experience showed that most air-to-air combat over Europe was taking place between these altitudes.
The power of the engine could also change according to the Octane rating of the aviation fuel being used. Higher octane fuels allowed boost pressures to be increased without the risks of pre-ignition or knocking.
The British measured boost pressure as lbs./sq.inch (or psi). The normal atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.6959 psi, although this can vary from day to day: a reading of +6 meant that the air/fuel mix was being compressed by a supercharger blower to 20.7 (rounded figure) psi before entering the engine; +25 meant that the air/fuel mix was being compressed to 39.7 psi. However, there was a problem with the British system of measuring boost, in that in an aircraft the pressure gauges should measure absolute pressure within the engine's supercharger, rather than showing atmospheric pressure at sea level, plus the supercharger's pressure; at sea level this was a reasonable measure but, in engines that were used through different altitudes this method becomes completely arbitrary. Because the Americans measured their boost ratings using inches of Mercury (" Hg), their boost gauges more accurately recorded the absolute pressures being generated by the superchargers at all altitudes.
Reliability of performance figures.
When reading performance figures it should always be borne in mind that weight, the aerodynamic drag generated by different external fittings, the condition of the airframe and/or engine, and all sorts of other factors could influence how an aircraft performed. For example, the P-51's laminar flow wings needed to be kept as clean and smooth as possible; even relatively minor damage on the wing leading edges could drastically reduce top speed. The most accurate performance figures for the P-51 came from tests carried out at facilities such as the USAAF's "Flight Test Engineering Branch", which was based at Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio and, for the RAF, the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) based at Boscombe Down. North American Aviation carried out their own performance tests, as did the only other manufacturer of the P-51, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) of Australia.

Organ reform movement

The Organ Reform Movement or "Orgelbewegung" (also called the Organ Revival Movement) was an early 20th-century trend in pipe organ building, originating in Germany. It was influential in the United States in the 1940s. The movement waned in the 1980s. It arose with early interest in historical performance and was strongly influenced by, among others, Albert Schweitzer's championing of historical instruments by Silbermann and others, as well as by his declaration that the criterion for judging an organ is its fitness to play the music of J. S. Bach. It ultimately went beyond the copying of old instruments to endorse a new philosophy of organbuilding, however.
History.
The movement sought to turn away from many of the perceived excesses of Romantic or Orchestral organ building, in favor of organs understood to be more similar to those of the Baroque Era in Northern Germany. This took the form of a vertical style of registration in which ensembles were ideally built up with no pitch being duplicated in the same octave. The movement endorsed the so-called "Werkprinzip", in which each division was based on a principal-scale rank of a different octave. 
Organ voicers strove for an articulate speech characterized by chiff and avoided nicking, beards and other means of achieving 'smoothness'. Low wind pressures were revived. Casework was often eschewed in favor of open standing pipework and swellboxes became relatively rare.
In Europe the movement was indelibly connected with mechanical action instruments; in North America this was not the case and many instruments characteristic of the Organ Reform Movement had electric action.
Some of the leading builders of the movement were Frobenius, G. Donald Harrison, Holtkamp, Schlicker, Dirk Andries Flentrop and Beckerath.
Reversals.
Some of the changes the reform movement executed on existing organs of pre-movement times are since being reversed, such as in the organ of the Auckland Town Hall.

Sampit

Sampit is a town and a timber port on the Sampit River in the Central Kalimantan province in Indonesia. It is the seat of East Kotawaringin regency. Sampit is the biggest timber port in all of Indonesia.
Sampit is also known as Sampit, Tanah Hevea. According to reported data as of August 2009, the estimated population of Sampit is 66,053. The average elevation of the town is .
History.
Sampit town became known worldwide following inter-ethnic violent communal clashes between the Dayaks and the Madurese during the Sampit conflict which broke out on February 17, 2001 and lasted for 10 days. There are a number of stories purportedly describing the incident that sparked the violence in 2001. One version claims that it was caused by an arson attack on a Dayak house. Rumours spread that the fire was caused by Madurese, and later a group of Dayaks began burning houses in a Madurese neighbourhood. Another version says that the massacre was triggered by an earlier incident in December 2000 when a Dayak man was killed by three Madurese.
In just two weeks 469 were reported to have been killed, of which 456 of them were Madurese. Virtually the entire Madurese people fled and "ethnic cleansing" has taken place in Sampit and surrounding areas, despite the Madurese previously forming about 60% of the population. However, according to a BBC report, the overall picture of the conflict caused 500 deaths, with over 100,000 Madurese displaced from their homes. Many Madurese were also found decapitated by the Dayaks. Several hundreds of the immigrants fled from the area and moved by naval vessels to their homes in Madura island in East Java.
Geography.
Sampit lies in southern-mid Borneo on the banks of the Sampit River also called the "Mentaya River" is a river of Central Kalimantan in Borneo. The river takes its name from the town of Sampit which is situated on the bank of river not too distant from the Java Sea. The Schwaner mountain range extends with long hill ridges southwards, separating the major river systems of the area, most notably the Bukit Baka hill range which extends down to Sampit Bay. The area between the town of Sampit and the coast was historically heavily forested but has since been reduced due to road construction and development projects.
To the north of Sampit, on the road to Pangkalanbun, is an area of peat-swamp forest.
Sampit is from the mouth of the river. Road networks connect to the capital cities of the regency and one such road is the Palangkaraya-Sampit-Purukcahu. However, river transport is the common transport for communications. Apart from navigational approach from the Java Sea and inland road network, Sampit also has the Sampit Airport , also known as H. Asan Airport, is a public airport in Sampit, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Airline services are provided by the Kal Star Aviation to Banjarmasin, Ketapang, Pangkalan Bun and Pontianak, and the Merpati Nusantara Airlines to Jakarta and Surabaya.
Landmarks.
Important landmarks in the area are the Pandaran Beach at the mouth of the Sampit River, the Orchid Park of Pembuangan Hulu and hunting park of Kotawaringin at the border.
This beach is located towards the sea side at the mouth of Sampat River. It is developed as a park. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that a river debouches into the sea on its northern side while the Java Sea provides a wide expanse of water on its southern side.
The Orchid Park is part of the Pembuangan Hulu. It has a galaxy of orchid plants.

<doc id="18855029" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18855029" title="Envy">
Envy

Envy (from Latin "invidia") is an emotion which "occurs when a person lacks another's superior quality, achievement, or possession and either desires it or wishes that the other lacked it"
Bertrand Russell said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness. Not only is the envious person rendered unhappy by his envy, but they also wish to inflict misfortune on others. Although envy is generally seen as something negative, Russell also believed that envy was a driving force behind the movement towards democracy and must be endured to achieve a more just social system. However, psychologists have recently suggested that there may be two types of envy: malicious envy and benign envy—benign envy being proposed as a type of positive motivational force.
Socioevolutionary view.
One theory that helps to explain envy and its effects on human behavior is the Socioevolutionary theory. Based upon (Charles) Darwin's (1859) theory of evolution through natural selection, socioevolutionary theory predicts that humans behave in ways that enhance individual survival and also the reproduction of their genes. Thus, this theory provides a framework for understanding social behavior and experiences, such as the experience and expression of envy, as rooted in biological drives for survival and procreation. Recent studies have demonstrated that inciting envy actually changes cognitive function, boosting mental persistence and memory.
Comparison with jealousy.
"Envy" and "jealousy" are often used interchangeably in common usage, but strictly speaking, the words stand for two distinct emotions. Jealousy is the result or fear of losing someone or something that one is attached to or possesses to another person (the transfer of a lover's affections in the typical form), while envy is the resentment caused by another person having something that one does not have, but desires for oneself.
Schadenfreude.
"Schadenfreude" means taking pleasure in the misfortune of others and can be understood as an outgrowth of envy in certain situations.
Regarding possessions or status.
Often, envy involves a motive to "outdo or undo the rival's advantages". In part, this type of envy may be based on materialistic possessions rather than psychological states. Basically, people find themselves experiencing an overwhelming emotion due to someone else owning or possessing desirable items that they do not. For example, your next door neighbor just bought a brand new ocarina—a musical instrument you've been infatuated with for months now but can't afford. Feelings of envy in this situation would occur in the forms of emotional pain, a lack of self-worth, and a lowered self-esteem/well-being.
In Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.'s "Old Money", he states that "envy is so integral and painful a part of what animates human behavior in market societies that many people have forgotten the full meaning of the word, simplifying it into one of the symptoms of desire. It is that [(a symptom of desire)], which is why it flourishes in market societies: democracies of desire, they might be called, with money for ballots, stuffing permitted. But envy is more or less than desire. It begins with the almost frantic sense of emptiness inside oneself, as if the pump of one's heart were sucking on air. One has to be blind to perceive the emptiness, of course, but that's what envy is, a selective blindness. "Invidia", Latin for envy, translates as "nonsight," and Dante had the envious plodding along under cloaks of lead, their eyes sewn shut with leaden wire. What they are blind to is what they have, God-given and humanly nurtured, in themselves".
Overcoming envy.
Envy may negatively affect the closeness and satisfaction of relationships. Overcoming envy might be similar to dealing with other negative emotions (anger, resentment, etc.). Individuals experiencing anger often seek professional treatment (anger management) to help understand why they feel the way they do and how to cope. Subjects experiencing envy often have a skewed perception on how to achieve true happiness. By helping people to change these perceptions, they will be more able to understand the real meaning of fortune and satisfaction with what they do have. According to Lazarus, "coping is an integral feature of the emotion process". There are very few theories that emphasize the coping process for emotions as compared to the information available concerning the emotion itself.
There are numerous styles of coping, of which there has been a significant amount of research done, for example, avoidant versus approach. Coping with envy can be similar to coping with anger. The issue must be addressed cognitively in order to work through the emotion. According to the research done by Salovey and Rodin (1988), "more effective strategies for reducing initial envy appear to be stimulus focused rather than self-focused.". Salovey and Rodin (1988) also suggest "self-bolstering (e.g., "thinking about my good qualities") may be an effective strategy for moderating these self-deprecating thoughts and muting negative affective reactions". Further research needs to be done in order to better understand envy, as well as to help people cope with this emotion.
Narcissists.
Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder are often envious of others or believe others are envious of them.
A narcissist may secure a sense of superiority in the face of another person's ability by using contempt to minimize the other person.
In philosophy.
Aristotle (in Rhetoric) defined envy (φθόνος "phthonos") "as the pain caused by the good fortune of others", while Kant defined it as "a reluctance to see our own well-being overshadowed by another's because the standard we use to see how well off we are is not the intrinsic worth of our own well-being but how it compares with that of others" (in Metaphysics of Morals).
Religious views.
In Hinduism.
"One who does not envy but is a compassionate friend to all ... such a devotee is very dear to Me." - Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 12, Verse 15.
In Hinduism, envy is considered a disastrous emotion. Hinduism maintains that anything which causes the mind to lose balance with itself leads to misery. This concept is put forth in the epic Mahabharata, wherein Duryodhana launches the Kurukshetra war out of envy of the perceived prosperity of his cousins. He is known to have remarked:
"Father! The prosperity of the Pandavas (cousins) is burning me deeply! I cannot eat, sleep or live in the knowledge that they are better off than me!"
Thus, Hinduism teaches that envy can be overcome simply by recognizing that the man or woman who is the object of one's envy is merely enjoying the fruits of their past karmic actions and that one should not allow such devious emotions to take control of their mind, lest they suffer the same fate as the antagonists of the Mahabharata.
In Christianity.
In the Bible.
Envy is one of the Seven deadly sins of the Catholic Church. In the Book of Genesis envy is said to be the motivation behind Cain murdering his brother, Abel, as Cain envied Abel because God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's.
A ruining flesh sin
Envy is a sin of flesh. Envy (evil eye) is among the things that come from the heart, defiling a person. The whole body is full of darkness when the eye, the lamp of body, is bad., He who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished, said Solomon. Envy ruins the body health because it makes the bone rot and excludes us from inheriting the kingdom of God. Sometimes, as a punishment, God leaves some people in their sins, falling prey to envy and other heavy sins.
Universal and profound sin
The basis of all toil and all skill of the people (we always choose our job because we want the wealthy, fame and pleasures we see at the others's job around us), envy is, therefore, a sin deeply engraved in human nature. It appears (comes into being) when man lacks certain things, circumstance that exist when either he does not ask it from God or asks to spend it on his passions (pleasures).
Genesis and causes
Envy may be cause by wealth (Isaac, envied of Philistines), by the brightness of wealth, power and beauty (Assyria kingdom envied of other kingdoms by political and military rising ( Saul eyed David from the moment he heard the women song of joy), fertility (Leah, envied of Rachel), social ascent (Joseph whom his brothers were jealous of), countless miracles and healings (the apostles envied of high priest and the Sadducees), popularity (Paul and Barnabas, envied of unfaithful Jewish from Antioch), the success of Christianization of many Thessalonians (Paul and Silas, envied of unfaithful Jews from Thessalonica), virtues and true power to heal, to make miracles and to teach people (Jesus envied of the chief priests) 
God will reward each according to his deeds
Christians must not fall into the trap of envying of the wicked of the men of violence of those who seem to have a happy, prosperous, untroubled life, but always be aware that God will reward each according to his deeds. The true Christian will be sure, as the psalmist the moment he enters the temple of God, that those bloated, with "pride as necklace" and "violence as garment" (clothing), which are stumbling block to the faith of ordinary people, will fade like greens, will be cut down quickly like the grass ", being thrown away and ruined the right time.
Happy for anyone saved
Also, the Christians must not look with evil eye at the last converts to avoid therefore becoming the last ones, missing the kingdom of God. They should be happy for anyone saved, like Christ, who came to save the lost, as the shepherd seeking the lost sheep. Zacchaeus, the chief tax collector, was among the lost ones and he succeeded in bringing salvation to him and to his house.
No good eating the envier's bread
It is no good eating the envier's bread, nor desiring his delicacies, because he is like one who is inwardly calculating", his heart is not with you" and so, you will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten, and waste your pleasant words".
Envy and wisdom
Sometimes arisen out of sophistry, envy cannot coexist with true and spiritual wisdom, but with false, earthly, unspiritual, demonic wisdom.
Struggle against envy
Throwing away envy is a crucial condition in our path to salvation. Envy was seen by the Apostle Paul as a real danger even within the first Christian communities. Envy should remain a sin of the past, defeated by God teaching, which, as in the tenth commandment, forbids us from coveting our neighbour's things, woman, and servants, and urges us to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep, as Apostle Paul said, and to love our neighbours as ourselves. Because brotherly, Christian love banishes definitively envy from our hearts.
In Islam.
In Islam, envy (Hassad حسد in Arabic) is an impurity of the heart and can destroy one's good deeds. One must be content with what God has willed and believe in the justice of the creator. A Muslim should not allow his envy to inflict harm upon the envied person. 
Muhammad said, "Do not envy each other, do not hate each other, do not oppose each other, and do not cut relations, rather be servants of Allah as brothers. It is not permissible for a Muslim to disassociate from his brother for more than three days such that they meet and one ignores the other, and the best of them is the one who initiates the salaam." Sahih al-Bukhari Trans. 8/58 no. 91, Sahih Muslim Trans. 4/1360 no. 6205, 6210
A Muslim may wish for himself a blessing like that which someone else has, without wanting it to be taken away from the other person. This is permissible and is not called hasad. Rather, it is called ghibtah.
"There is to be no envy except in two cases: (towards) a person to whom Allah has granted wisdom, and who rules by this and teaches it to the people, and (towards) a person to whom Allah has granted wealth and property along with the power to spend it in the cause of the Truth." & Muslim
In Buddhism.
In Buddhism, the term irshya is commonly translated as either envy or jealousy. "Irshya" is defined as a state of mind in which one is highly agitated to obtain wealth and honor for oneself, but unable to bear the excellence of others.
The term "mudita" (sympathetic joy) is defined as taking joy in the good fortune of others. This virtue is considered the antidote to envy and the opposite of schadenfreude.
Cultural references.
In English-speaking cultures, envy is often associated with the color green, as in "green with envy". The phrase "green-eyed monster" refers to an individual whose current actions appear motivated by jealousy not envy. This is based on a line from Shakespeare's "Othello". Shakespeare mentions it also in "The Merchant of Venice" when Portia states: "How all the other passions fleet to air, as doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair and shuddering fear and green-eyed jealousy!"
Envy is known as one of the most powerful human emotions for its ability to control one as if envy was an entity in itself. Countless men and women have fallen prey to brief periods of intense envy followed by anger which then translates into aggression. One of the most common examples is a woman who is envious of another's beauty, such as in the fairy tale "Snow White", in which the Queen is envious of Snow White's youth and beauty, and seeks to kill the young woman in order to once again be the "fairest of them all".

Hector Quintanilla

Hector Quintanilla JR. (May 7, 1923 - May 18, 1998) was a United States Air Force (USAF) Lt Colonel best known as the last chief officer of Project Blue Book, the USAF's official unidentified flying object investigative arm.
Biography.
Born in Monterrey Nuevo, León, Mexico in 1923, Hector Quintanilla Jr. emigrated to the U.S. with his family in 1929 as a young boy (Quintanilla had three brothers). He and his family crossed the Gateway to the Americas International Bridge in Laredo Texas. He was 6 years old at the time. His family made their home in west side San Antonio around the Laredo and Martin street neighborhoods. His family could only afford a $1.25 a week shack with a dirt floor. Hector and his brothers did not mind because they mostly wore their shoes on Sundays to go to church. He was selling newspapers for the San Antonio Express and San Antonio Light mornings and evenings by age seven. He would peddle his papers around the Baptist Medical Hospital area. Quintanilla also built a shoe box to shine shoes. He decided to offer shoe shine service as well, due to the reluctance of some customers to let go of 2 cents for a newspaper during hard (depression) times. He would wake up at 4:30 A.M. to begin and organize his paper route. He was a student at Hawthorne Jr. High and graduated from Brackenridge High School in San Antonio in 1942. A friend later helped him get a part-time job with the U.S. Post Office. He was enrolled in St. Mary University as a freshman when he received his draft notice. He was drafted in 1943 and honorably discharged in 1945. Quintanilla served in the South Pacific Theater in the 13th Air Force, 72nd Squadron, as a bombardier.
He received a physics degree from St. Mary University in 1950. He decided to pursue a military career and was offered a commission of Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in 1951. In 1954 he was C.O of unit 6910 Security Group in Landsberg, Bavaria. He was an officer in the United States Air Force Security Service. His wife, Eleanor, joined him on this tour. His troops had been trained in San Antonio and had enjoyed Mexican food. They stated that his beautiful wife invited them to a Mexican Christmas dinner in 1954. In 1960 Quintanilla later served at Griffis AFB, Rome, New York.
He headed Project Blue Book from 1963 until its closure in 1970. Project Blue Book was started in 1952. The USAF announced Project Blue Book's closing on December 17, 1969 and officially closed it on January 30, 1970. He succeeded Lt. Col. Robert Friend. He was selected to be the next Project Blue Book Officer by Colonel Eric T de Jonckheere, who explained to Quintanilla that he was looking to fill the position with a man with a degree in physics, with maturity, drive, and a man who was cool under pressure. Quintanilla shook his head and felt he only met the degree requirement. Col Joncheere told Quintanilla to take the job for a few weeks and report to him. Quintanilla felt he was offered the job due to his reluctance to take several other job offers in the escalating Vietnam War. Project Blue Book left a legacy of over 12,000 reported UFO's investigated of which 30 percent or over 4,000 cases, were classified as unknown causes.
Lt Col Quintanilla retired in San Antonio after Project Blue Book was closed. Sometime afterwards he was injured in a golfing cart accident. He sustained a head injury that affected him in later years. He died May 18, 1998 in San Antonio, Texas. Quintanilla left behind six children (Gene,Tessie,Karl,Nancy,Diane and Bob)and several grand children.
Project Blue Book was often harshly criticized by those who argued he was not properly investigating UFO reports and was prone to improbable and/or untested "post hoc" explanations. After Blue Book folded, Quintanilla wrote a memoir, unpublished during his life and publicized in the '90s by the National Institute of Discovery Science, which explained Quintanilla's perspective on Blue Book and UFOs.

Football in the Netherlands

Football is the most popular sport in the Netherlands. Football was introduced to the Netherlands by Pim Mulier in the 19th century when in 1879, at the age of 14, he founded Haarlemsche Football Club. Over the next 30 years, Football gained popularity in the Netherlands and the late 1890s and early 1900s saw the foundation of many new clubs, notably Sparta Rotterdam in 1888, Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax in 1900, Feyenoord Rotterdam in 1908 and PSV Eindhoven in 1913.
The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) was founded on December 8, 1889 and joined FIFA in 1904 as one of the founding members alongside the Football Associations of France, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.
Professional football was introduced in 1954, with the establishment of the Dutch Professional Football Association ("Nederlandse Beroeps Voetbal Bond", or NBVB). The first professional game was played on August 14, 1954, between Alkmaar '54 and SC Venlo. The KNVB had opposed professional football for a long time, but eventually submitted to pressure and merged with the NBVB in November 1954 to form a new football association and a new (professional) league.
The highest level in Dutch football is now known as the Eredivisie (). The second level became the Eerste Divisie (First Division). Below that are two amateur divisions: the third level is the Topklasse and the fourth level the Hoofdklasse. The Topklasse was launched in 2010, before that time promotion to or relegation from the Eerste Divisie was not possible.
Dutch football is well known for its national football team, usually dressed in orange. They won the European Championship in 1988, and have competed in many European and World Cups. They finished second in the 1974,1978 and 2010 World Cups and third in the UEFA Euro 1976 tournament. They have reached many finals (1974 World Cup, 1978 World Cup, Euro 1988, 2010 World Cup) and semi-finals (Euro 1976, 1998 World Cup, Euro 2000, Euro 2004).

Magic in Artemis Fowl

In the fantasy book series Artemis Fowl, by Eoin Colfer, magic is an integral part of the world, although most humans do not have the ability to use it. Its use is almost completely restricted to the seven families (or groups) of fairies.
As revealed in the fifth book, magic is another type of energy, like its counterparts kinetic energy and light energy (among others)
It is subject (like every other type of energy) to the law that "Energy cannot be destroyed, only converted into another form."
When it is active, it is visible in the form of blue sparks.
Common Abilities.
Some common abilities among the fairies are the "Mesmer", "shielding" and healing.
The "Mesmer"
This is the ability to hypnotize humans, fairies and possibly other creatures (although mesmerising another fairy is illegal according to the fairy book); and is available to every fairy, even the ones most drained of magical energy. Some humans are more resilient to the mesmer than others, and wearing a pair of sunglasses makes you unable to be mesmerised, because the magic is reflected away.
Shielding
This is a bit of a misnomer, as it actually is simply a cloaking device (although it is not referred to like this in the series) When a fairy shields, they simply increase their heart rate to vibrate at such high speeds that the human eye cannot see them. 
However, only rats, two species of monkeys and high speed cameras can see through fairy shields.
Healing
This involves a fairy injecting magic into a wound (such as a scar or broken bone) and it being healed instantaneously.
Even fatal wounds can be healed, but, as shown in Book III (The Eternity Code) It takes years off the victim's life.
Human ability to use Magic.
In the series so far Artemis Fowl II is the only human ever to possess the ability to control magic. This is because he stole some pure magic while traveling to the "timeless" place called "Limbo", in which the land of Hybras, home to the seventh fairy family, the demons, is imprisoned.
During the first few chapters of the sixth book, however, Artemis uses up all of his magic in attempting to heal a fairy illness that his mother has contracted. Unfortunately, the disease is the magical illness Spelltropy, as diagnosed by the centaur Foaly.
Some humans are known to possess the "mesmer" as it is the lowest form of magic. These humans may quite obviously be hypnotists or psychics.

<doc id="18855389" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18855389" title="Corangamite Catchment Management Authority">
Corangamite Catchment Management Authority

The Corangamite Catchment Management Authority (CMA) region spans 13,000 square kilometres of south-west Victoria, Australia. About 350,000 people live within the catchment area, which stretches from Ballarat to Geelong and along the coast to Peterborough.
Corangamite region.
The Lake Corangamite region is famous for its spectacular coastline, which incorporates the Great Ocean Road and the Great Otway National Park. There are 13 Ramsar-listed wetlands in the catchment including Lake Corangamite, the largest permanent inland lake in Australia. Significant river systems include the Aire, Barwon, Gellibrand, Curdies, Leigh, Moorabool and Woady Yaloak rivers. The goldfields of Ballarat, tall timber of the Otway rainforests and lush grasslands attracted early settlement, and today Corangamite’s economic mainstays are agriculture, industry and tourism. Corangamite’s environmental challenges include land-use change, demands for water supply, urban migration, intensification of agriculture and increased tourism.
Program Highlights.
The Corangamite CMA began in 1997 with a small team of employees. During the past decade, the organisation has diversified, growing in size and responsibilities. In addition to the leadership and funding co-ordination responsibilities common to most Victorian CMAs, Corangamite CMA also has the statutory responsibilities of managing the Barwon River through Geelong, and two drainage schemes – the Woady Yaloak and Lough Calvert.
The Coragamite CMA's role as manager of the Barwon River through Geelong in particular provides an excellent platform to engage with thousands of people in Victoria’s largest regional city. The Corangamite region is home to one of the most stressed river systems in Victoria, the Moorabool River. The CMA's role as manager of environmental water reserve has provided them with opportunities to strengthen their relationships with water authorities and local communities. As more people seek the lifestyle benefits of living along the coast and hinterland, the seachange and treechange phenomenon presents another dimension to Corangamite CMA’s roles and responsibilities. Corangamite CMA is actively trying to capitalise on the engagement and capacity building opportunities along the coast through programs such as EstuaryWatch, and the employment of a marine and coastal coordinator.
Future Challenges.
CCMA has identified climate change as the most pressing issue facing the region moving forward. While climate change is a problem bigger than any one individual or organisation, the grassroots regional approach of catchment management authorities puts them in an ideal position to educate, inspire, empower and engage communities to act as one against the common threat of climate change.
This collective action will be at its most effective through co-operation between a web of stakeholders including CMAs, Landcare, local government, landholders, the agriculture sector, business, industry, schools, water authorities, regulatory bodies and government.

Andy Warhol (song)

"Andy Warhol" is a song written by David Bowie in 1971 for the album "Hunky Dory". This is an acoustic song about one of Bowie's greatest inspirations, the American pop artist Andy Warhol. The song starts with some studio chat where Bowie explains to producer Ken Scott, who has just been heard to mispronounce Warhol's name when introducing the take, the right way to say it. Scott solemnly reintroduces the take with the correct pronunciation. There follows several seconds of silence before Bowie asks if the tape is rolling. Upon realising they are indeed recording, Bowie bursts into laughter and begins playing. The song is memorable for its distinctive, flamenco-sounding opening riff on the acoustic guitar that continues through the song.
Bowie later played the song to Andy Warhol, who reportedly disliked it as he thought the lyrics made fun of his physical appearance. When the song had finished playing, Warhol and Bowie reportedly just stared at each other for a while until Warhol said "I like your shoes" and the pair then had a conversation about shoes.
Originally the song was written for Dana Gillespie in 1971, but her version of the song was not released until 1973 on her album "Weren't Born a Man". This version features Mick Ronson on guitar.

Riot (1997 film)

Riot is a 1997 American television movie starring Luke Perry, Mario Van Peebles, and Lucy Liu. It was written and directed by four writers and directors of four different racial groups prominent in Los Angeles. The title riot is the Los Angeles riots of 1992 that were sparked by the beating of Rodney King, and the subsequent acquittal of the four police officers who beat him.
Plot.
The film dissects the aftermath of the Rodney King verdict and the ensuing riots through four narratives. A Chinese liquor store owner tries to come to an understanding with his assimilating teenage son who sees his father's old world ways and non-aggressive Buddhism as signs of weakness. A hispanic teenager tries to live a straight life and do well in school so he will not make the same mistakes his older brother had made, and be able to provide as best he can for his current and future family. A white LAPD officer struggles with obligations from his new girlfriend and not-quite-ex-wife, while confronting a surprisingly gung ho attitude from his fellow officers. An African American middle class man who has recently moved his new family out of "the ghetto", visits the store his father used to own in the old neighborhood and seeks to give some good news to his mother who has vivid memories from living through the Watts riots less than thirty years prior. These four stories are nominally separate vignettes, but interact with each other throughout the film.

Richard Cordtz

Richard Webster Cordtz (December 20, 1921 – November 20, 2006) was an American labor leader. From 1980 to 1995, he was the International Secretary-Treasurer of the Service Employees International Union under John Sweeney, and was president of the union himself from October 1995 to May 1996.
Early life.
Richard Cordtz was born in Chicago, Illinois, in December 1921. He graduated from high school, but rather than attending college he worked in a brass manufacturing plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and joined his first union.
During World War II, he served in the United States Army in the South Pacific. After the war, he attended college in San Diego, California. He worked part-time at Del Mar Racetrack, where he joined SEIU Local 102.
Cordtz and his wife, Tina, had three children.
SEIU career.
Cordtz began working as a union organizer for Local 102 in 1947. He was assigned to organizing campaigns in Colorado in 1950, and was elected vice-president of the Colorado Federation of Labor at the age of 30.
Cordtz was assigned to SEIU Local 79, a union representing healthcare workers in Hazel Park, Michigan, in 1953. He was elected the local's president in 1956, and over the next 27 years expanded the union's membership from 1,000 to 20,000 and branched out to include custodial workers, fire fighters, security guards and non-salaried hospital workers. Cordtz was also elected president of SEIU Joint Council 35 (a coalition of Detroit-area SEIU locals), and president of Service Employees Central States Conference (a coalition of SEIU councils and state, regional and local bodies in the Midwest). Cordtz also served as vice-president of Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO and on the board of directors of the Michigan State AFL-CIO.
Cordtz rose within the SEIU international hierarchy as well. He was elected a member of the SEIU Executive Board in 1968, an International Vice President in 1972, and International Secretary-Treasurer in 1980. While he served as SEIU Secretary-Treasurer, Cordtz also was elected secretary-treasurer of the Conference of Secretary-Treasurers of the AFL-CIO, vice-president of the AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department, a director of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, an international board member of the International Federation of Commercial, Clerical and Technical Employees, and was a member of the Industrial Relations Research Association.
Cordtz played a prominent role in national union affairs as Secretary-Treasurer. For example, he stood in for SEIU President John Sweeney and publicly opposed a proposed federal takeover of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in 1986 and again in 1987, even though federal control was designed to eliminate the influence of organized crime in the union. He also often represented SEIU when existing independent locals affiliated with the larger union.
Cordtz retired from his position at the Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO in 1991 but his departure from these and other posts — many of which provided him with an income — angered his critics, who accused him of .
SEIU presidency and later life.
SEIU President John Sweeney won election as President of the AFL-CIO on October 25, 1995. Sweeney resigned as SEIU president on December 12, 1995, and the 74-year-old Cordtz was elected president the same day to serve out his unexpired term (which ended in April 1996).
Cordtz immediately announced that he would run in April 1996 for a full four-year term as SEIU president, but he ran into significant opposition from reformers in the union who felt he was too close to the "old guard" — white, male, highly paid, double-dipping officials who ran the union in an autocratic fashion. John Sweeney, who had once said he would not support electing anyone over the age of 70 to the SEIU presidency, reversed his position and announced his support for Cordtz's candidacy.
To improve his standing in the union, Cordtz adopted many of the militant tactics pioneered by Sweeney and other SEIU leaders. For example, he blocked traffic on a busy San Francisco, California, street in mid-February 1996 to protest the anti-union activities of Vencor Corp., then the nation's second-largest nursing home chain and a target of a major SEIU organizing drive.
As the SEIU convention neared, Cordtz chose Gus Bevona, President of SEIU Local 32B-32J, as his running mate instead of the incumbent (and Sweeney protégé), Betty Bednarczyk. Bevona had succeeded Sweeney as president of the giant janitorial and elevator operators union in New York City in 1980. Bevona suppressed opposition within the union, centralized authority and reduced democratic processes, engaged in a large number of legally- and ethically-questionable side-deals, and associated with known organized crime figures. In 1991, the highly reclusive union leader was earning $412,000 a year while most of his members made a paltry $29,800 a year. By 1996, his salary had ballooned to nearly $450,000 a year, and the New York City press had revealed that he had built himself a palatial office and lived in a union-owned penthouse rent-free. The announcement of the powerful but ethically-questionable Bevona as Cordtz's running mate cost Cordtz the support of John Sweeney.
On February 27, 1996, Andy Stern, SEIU's 45-year-old Organizing Director, announced he would run for the presidency of the union. His announcement created the first contested presidential election in the union's history. Cordtz fired Stern for insubordination on March 1, and asked that Stern's supporters resign from the union's executive board.
SEIU's executive board met on March 11, 1996. By that time, however, it was clear that Stern had the support of Locals representing nearly two-thirds of the union's membership. The same day, Cordtz withdrew from the race and endorsed Stern. Bevona quietly withdrew his candidacy for secretary-treasurer a few weeks later.
Richard Cordtz retired as president of SEIU when delegates to the union's convention in Chicago elected Andy Stern the new president on April 23, 1996.
In retirement, Cordtz continued to serve as chairman of Labor's International Hall of Fame, which he had helped co-found in 1988.
Richard Cordtz died on November 20, 2006, at his home in Dearborn, Michigan. His wife and three children survived him.

Negro

The word “Negro” is used in the English-speaking world to refer to a person of black ancestry or appearance. The word "negro" denotes 'black' in the Spanish and Portuguese, derived from the ancient Latin word, "niger", 'black', which itself ultimately is probably from a Proto-Indo-European root "*nekw-", 'to be dark', akin to "*nokw-" 'night'.
"Negro" superseded "colored" as the most polite terminology, at a time when "black" was more offensive. This usage was accepted as normal, even by people classified as Negroes, until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s. One well-known example is the identification by Martin Luther King, Jr. of his own race as 'Negro' in his famous 1963 speech I Have a Dream.
During the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some black American leaders in the United States, notably Malcolm X, objected to the word "Negro" because they associated the word Negro with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second class citizens, or worse. (Malcolm X preferred "Black" to "Negro", but also started using the term "Afro-American" after leaving the Nation of Islam.)
Since the late 1960s, various other terms have been more widespread in popular usage. These include "black", "Black African", "Afro-American" (in use from the late 1960s to 1990) and "African American" (used in the United States to refer to black Americans, peoples often referred to in the past as American Negroes).
The term "Negro" is still used in some historical contexts, such as in the name of the United Negro College Fund and the Negro league in sports.
The United States Census Bureau announced that "Negro" would be included on the 2010 United States Census, alongside "Black" and "African-American" because some older black Americans still self-identify with the term.
In English.
Around 1442 the Portuguese first arrived in sub-Saharan Africa while trying to find a sea route to India. The term "negro", literally meaning "black", was used by the Spanish and Portuguese as a simple description to refer to people. From the 18th century to the late 1960s, "negro" (later capitalized) was considered to be the proper English-language term for certain people of sub-Saharan African origin.
The word "Negro" fell out of favor by the early 1970s in the United States after the Civil Rights movement. However, older African Americans from the earlier period of American life (when "Negro" was "widely" considered to be acceptable) initially found the term "black" more offensive than "Negro." Evidence for the acceptability of "Negro" is in the continued use the word by historical African-American organizations and institutions such as the United Negro College Fund. In current English language usage, "Negro" is "generally" considered to be acceptable in a historical context, such as baseball's Negro Leagues of the early and mid-20th century, or in the name of older organizations, as in Negro spirituals, the United Negro College Fund or the Journal of Negro Education. The U.S. Census now uses the grouping "Black, African-American, or Negro." The term "Negro" is used in efforts to include older African Americans who more closely associate with the term.
A specifically female form of the word—"negress" (sometimes capitalized)—was sometimes used; but, like "Jewess", it has all but completely fallen from use. (An exception is its unusual use in the titles of paintings, drawings and sculptures, largely as an allusion to the formerly common occurrence of the word in such titles, but such usage has dropped off dramatically.) Both terms are considered to be racist and sexist although, as with other racial, ethnic, and sexual words that are seen as pejorative, some people have tried to reclaim the words, for example, the artist Kara Walker.
The related word "Negroid" was used by 19th- and 20th-century racial anthropologists. The suffix -oid means "similar to". "Negroid" as a noun was used to designate a wider or more generalized category than "Negro"; as an adjective it qualified a noun as in, for example, "negroid features".
In other languages.
In Portuguese, "negro" is an adjective for the color black, although "preto" is the most common antonym of "branco" (white). In Brazil and Portugal, "negro" is the most respectful way to address people of Black African descent, with "preto" sometimes being considered politically incorrect or a racial slur.
While "negro" is most commonly used to describe the color in general in Spanish, it can also be used to describe people with dark-colored skin. In Spain, Mexico and almost all of Latin-America, "negro" (note that no ethnonyms, names of nationalities, etc. at all are generally capitalized in Romance languages) means "black person" in colloquial situations, but it can be considered to be derogatory in other situations (as in English, "black" is often used to mean irregular or undesirable, as in "black market/mercado negro"). However, in Spanish-speaking countries such as Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay where there are few people of African origin and appearance, "negro" ("negra" for females) is commonly used to refer to partners, close friends or people in general independent of skin color. In Venezuela the word "negro" is similarly used, despite its large African descent population.
Its usage can be similar to the use of the word "nigga" in urban communities in the United States. For example, one might say to a friend, ""Negro ¿Como andas?" (literally "Hey, black one, how are you doing?"). In this case, the diminutive "negrito" can be used, as a term of endearment meaning "pal", "buddy" or "friend". "Negrito" has come to be used to refer to a person of any ethnicity or color, and also can have a sentimental or romantic connotation similar to "sweetheart", or "dear" in English (in the Philippines, "negrito" was used for a local dark-skinned short person, living in the Negros islands among other places).
In other Spanish-speaking South American countries, the word "negro" can also be employed in a roughly equivalent form, though it is not usually considered to be as widespread as in Argentina or Uruguay (except perhaps in a limited regional and/or social context). In Brazil, it heavily depends on the region. In Rio de Janeiro, for example, where the main racial slur against black people is "crioulo" (literally creole i.e. American-born African), "preto/preta" and "pretinho/pretinha" can along extremely informal situations be used the same ways as "negro/negra" and "negrito/negrita" in Spanish-speaking South American, but it heavily changes in the nearby state of São Paulo, where "crioulo" is considered an archaism and "preto" is the most used racial slur against black people, thus all kind of use of the "preto" word can be deemed as offensive.
"Moreno" can be used as an euphemism both in Spanish and Portuguese but it also means just "tanned" or "dark-haired". People from all ethnic origins and races can be addressed by such word, but the widespread use of the word as a roughly equivalent of the English "swarthy" in Brazil made it a very colloquial term for Pardo and all other non-White people. Generally, nevertheless nowadays it is considered politically incorrect to address an Afro-Brazilian by the term "moreno", as if it was a subtle attempt of erasing their blackness by calling them "swarthy one" (the historical stigma of being Black or partially Black in Brazil made many people being "racially promoted" from Black to Pardo and from Pardo to White, and this can be seen as a perpetuation of this process). Still, this use for westernized Amerindians, mixed-race people of Amerindian and European descent, multiracial afrodescendants and Asian people with dark complexions is entirely not offensive. Similar trends in the Hispanic world are not so well-noticed.
In Turkish, the word "siyahi" is generally used as a neutral term to address a person of dark-skinned or blackish appearance. "Siyahi", literally means black-colored, is gradually replaced by a more official word "Afrika kökenli" (of African origin). "Zenci" (from the Arabic "zanj") is quite a popular colloquial term to refer to a person of African origin and it is commonly used without any negative connotation. Sometimes "çikolata renkli" (Chocolate colored) can be heard as a sympathetic definition for a black sport player or a celebrity. A rare and old-fashioned word "Marsık" literally denotes to charcoal can offensively be used to define a skinny and heavily tanned person, not necessarily a person of African descent.
In Haitian Creole, the word "nèg", derived from the French "nègre", refers to a dark-skinned man; it can also be used for any man, regardless of skin color, roughly like "guy" or "dude" in American English.
The Dutch word, "neger" is generally (but not universally) considered to be a neutral one, or at least less negative than "zwarte" (black one).
In German, "Neger" was considered to be a neutral term for black people, but gradually fell out of fashion since the 1970s. "Neger" is now mostly thought to be derogatory or racist. The terms "Schwarzer" (black person), "Farbiger" (colored person) or "Afrikaner"/"Afro-Amerikaner" (African/Afro-American) are commonly used, and the obsolete "Mohr" (from Latin "morus", black) survives in advertising. There is also a kind of sweet traditionally referred to as "Negerkuss" (literally "negro kiss").
In Hungarian, "néger" (possibly originates in its German equivalent) is still considered to be the most neutral term (together with "afro-amerikai" which is rarely used), while other words such as "fekete" (black person) or "színesbőrű" (colored person) are somewhat offensive. However, the term "nigger" is widely considered to be extremely pejorative.
In Russia, the term ""негр"" ("negr"), that in late 19th century replaced the antiquated ""арап"" (distorted ""араб"", bisected from "Arabia") or ""мавр"" (from "Mauritania"), was commonly used in the Soviet period without any negative connotation, and its use continues in this neutral sense. In modern Russian media, the word is used somewhat less frequently—""африканцы"" ("afrikantsy", "Africans") or ""афро-американцы"" ("afro-amerikantsy", "Afro-Americans") are used instead, depending on the situation), but is still common in oral speech. The word "black" (чёрный) as a noun used as a form of address is pejorative, although it is primarily used with respect to peoples of the Caucasus, natives of Central Asia, and not black people. The word "black" (чёрный) as an adjective is also used in a neutral sense and means the same as ""негр"" ("negr"), e.g. ""чёрные американцы"" ("chyornuye amerikantsuy", "black Americans"), ""чёрное население"" ("chyornoe naselenie", "the black population"), etc. Other alternatives to ""негр"" are "темнокожий" ("temnokozhiy"—"dark-skinned"), "чернокожий" ("chernokozhiy"—"black-skinned"). These two are used as both nouns and adjectives.
In the Italian, "negro" was used as a neutral term until the end of the 1960s. Nowadays the word is considered offensive; if used with a clear offensive intention it may be punished by law. Joking, non-offensive words are: moretto, moretta. Neutral words to define a black or dark-skinned person are "nero" (literally "black") or "di colore" (coloured—or literally "of colour").
In Swedish, as well as in Norwegian, "neger" used to be considered a neutral term for black people, but the term has gradually fallen out of favour through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Today the neutral term to define a black person is "svart" ("black"). There is a Swedish pastry traditionally called "negerboll" (literally "negro ball"). Due to its possible offensive character, the name has fallen out of favor in for example new cooking books, being replaced by "Chokladboll" (Chocolate Ball), though it is still used colloquially.
In Denmark, "Neger" is still considered a neutral word that most of the population use when describing a person of African descent.
In the Finnish language the word "neekeri" ("negro") was considered a neutral term for black people. Very few—if literally any—black people lived in Finland before the 1980s. In 2002 "neekeri"'s definition was changed from "perceived as derogatory by some" to "generally derogatory" in line with "ryssä" (Ruskie) and "hurri" (Swedish-speaking Finn) in "Kielitoimiston sanakirja". Also, there was a popular Finnish pastry called "Neekerinsuukko" ("lit." "negro's kiss"). The manufacturer changed the name to "Brunbergin suukko" ("Brunberg's kiss") in 2001. Today, neutral terms to define a black person include "musta" ("black"), "tumma" ("lit." "dark-shaded"), "tummaihoinen" ("dark-skinned") and "mustaihoinen" ("black-skinned"). A study conducted among native Finns found that 90 % of research subjects considered the terms ”neekeri”, ”ryssä” ja ”manne” (term referring to Finnish Roma) most derogatory names for ethnic minorities.
In the French language, the positive concept of "negritude" was developed by the Senegalese politician Léopold Sédar Senghor. The word "nègre" as a racial term fell out of favor around the same time as its English equivalent "Negro", but is still used today in French to refer to a ghostwriter (i.e. one who writes a book on behalf of its nominal author).
The word for a black man in the Irish language is "fear gorm", which literally means "blue man". This is because the phrase "fear dubh"—literally, "black man"—was already in use meaning the devil before black people were known in Ireland.

Les millions d'Arlequin

"Les millions d'Arlequin (a.k.a. Harlequinade") is a ballet in two acts with libretto and choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Riccardo Drigo. First presented at the Imperial Theatre of the Hermitage by the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia on Friday, . The ballet was given a second premiere on the stage of the stage of the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre with the same cast on . 
The Ballet Master Fyodor Lopukhov later restaged the ballet as "Harlequinade" in a one act version for the Ballet of the Maly Theatre of Leningrad. The production premiered on 13 June 1933. Audiences outside of Russia are perhaps most familiar with George Balanchine's revival, which the Ballet Master staged as "Harlequinade" for the New York City Ballet. This production that premiered at the New York State Theater in New York City on 4 February 1965.
Riccardo Drigo's score spawned the popular piece known as the "Serenade", which the composer later transformed into a song under the title "Notturno d'amour".
Performance history.
Originally created by the choreographer Marius Petipa and the composer Riccardo Drigo for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia. It was first performed for the Imperial Court on February 10, 1900 at the Imperial Theatre of the Hermitage, and given a second premiere for the public on February 13, 1900 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. The original cast for both performances was Mathilde Kschessinskaya as Columbine, Georgi Kiaksht as Harlequin, Olga Preobrajenska as Pierrette, Sergei Lukianov as Pierrot, Enrico Cecchetti as Casandré, and Anna Urakhova as the Good Fairy. Included at the first performance were Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorvna (to whom Drigo dedicated the score). So moved was the imperial audience by Drigo's music that the composer was mobbed during the final curtain calls. 
Drigo's score spawned the popular salon repertory piece known as the "Serenade", which the composer later re-wrote as a song called "Nuttorno d'amore" for Beniamino Gigli. The "Serenade" has since been arranged for every conceivable instrument, particularly the violin and piano.
George Balanchine staged an important revival of the work in honor of the ballet's 65th anniversary for the New York City Ballet, premiering February 4, 1965 under the title "Harlequinade". The leading dancers were Patricia McBride as Columbine, Edward Vilella as Harlequin, Suki Schorer as Pierrette, and Deni Lamont as Pierrot.
In April 2007, the Salt Creek Ballet of Westmont, Illinois performed a version of the Petipa/Drigo "Harlequinade". Performed at College of DuPage, the program was a success and received outstanding reviews from several major newspapers. The principal cast was Alexander Kozadayev as Harlequin, and Katherine Bruno as Columbine, and Hartley Parrish as the Good Fairy.
Russian Ballet Master and choreographer Vladimir Issaev, created his own version of the entire ballet "Harlequinade". It was performed by Arts Ballet Theatre of Florida at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His revival of the ballet includes special effects and costumes by Jorge Gallardo and sets by Elena Bondarenko. In 2011, the ballet was performed again in Miami, Florida.

Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area

Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area is a natural area in Perry County, Pennsylvania, near New Bloomfield, which protects a colony of box huckleberry over 1,000 years old. The smallest Natural Area in Pennsylvania, it is administered as part of Tuscarora State Forest. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in April 1967.
Topography.
A path forms a loop around the site, which is located on the west side of a hill slope. Twenty-seven interpretive stations are located along the trail. In addition to the low growth of the box huckleberry itself, the hillside is covered with white pine and oak forest, with a scattering of other trees and various wildflowers.
History.
The specimen of box huckleberry at the natural area has been estimated, based on its observed rate of growth and clonal reproduction, to be 1,200 to 1,300 years old, only a tenth of the estimated age for a nearby colony at Losh Run. The colony was discovered by Spencer Baird in 1845. No specimens of box huckleberry had been collected since 1805, and Baird's discovery allowed Asa Gray to classify the species as "Gaylussacia brachycera". The resulting correspondence sparked a lifelong friendship between the two, and helped Baird attain a post at the Smithsonian Institution.
The box huckleberry remained largely obscure until 1918, when Frederick V. Coville examined the site. On the basis of his observations there, he concluded that box huckleberry was self-sterile and spread clonally. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of plants from the site, Coville called attention to its plight with an article in "Science". Renewed interest sparked the discovery of other box huckleberry colonies elsewhere in the Appalachians.
The New Bloomfield site was first protected with the donation of to the state in 1929, the beginning of the Natural Area.

Imad Zatara

Imad Zatara (Arabic: عماد زعترة; born on 1 October 1984) is a Swedish-born Palestinian footballer who plays for Åtvidabergs FF in the Allsvenskan as a midfielder.
Club career.
Early career.
Imad began his career in FC Inter Orhoy, a club famous for bringing players like Gabriel Özkan and Henok Goitom.
Vasalund/Essinge IF.
Imad spent his first six seasons on senior level at Stockholm based Essinge IK (who was merged with Vasalunds IF in 2003 creating Vasalund/Essinge IF making his debut only 17 years old. It didn't take long for Imad to evolve into one of the most important players of the team and one of the most coveted players of Swedish third level.
IF Brommapojkarna.
In 2007 Imad finally took the final step making his debut on the highest level of Swedish football when moving to another Stockholm based club, IF Brommapojkarna who were about to play their first season ever in Allsvenskan. Unfortunately the team struggled in the bottom of the table and at the end of the season the team got relegated to Superettan. Imad didn't get many chances in the starting eleven and often had to sit on the bench.
Zalaegerszegi TE.
After about a week long trial in early 2008 Imad got a contract with Hungarian Zalaegerszegi TE. He soon became an important player of the team and scored 3 goals in 12 appearances as the club finished 7th in Nemzeti Bajnokság I.
Syrianska FC.
Imad signed with Södertälje based Syrianska FC in early 2009 after being a very coveted name among the Stockholm based clubs. Imad spent two seasons with the club and was consistently a very important part of the team who finished on 4th place of Superettan in 2009. He was also part of the side that would secure promotion to the Allsvenskan in 2010, he turned in several key performances the following year allowing the club to retain its top-flight status.
Nîmes Olympique.
In February 2010 Imad signed a loan deal with French Ligue 2 club Nîmes Olympique. He made his debut against Le Havre AC on 12 February 2010 and also managed to score his first and only goal during his time in the club. He scored the equalizer in the 87th minute of a game that mainly will remembered for the 9 yellow and 2 red cards that were delivered in the game. Imad played 6 games for the club and returned to Syrianska FC after the season.
Sanat Naft.
On 23 December 2011, he signed a 6-month contract with Iran Pro League side, Sanat Naft, becoming the first Palestinian to play in Iran.
Åtvidabergs FF.
On 26 July 2012, Imad Zatara returned to Sweden with newly promoted Allsvenskan side Åtvidabergs FF. In 2013 Zatara scored 9 goals making him the second top scorer in the Allsvenskan, behind fellow Palestinian Imad Khalili.
International career.
Imad early took the decision to play for his native country Palestine. The debut came in 2004 in the 1–4 defeat against Iraq, in which Zatara scored his first international goal. He has also been called up for Palestine in 2010. Zatara captained the national team for the first time in a friendly against the Malaysia national football team.
Personal life.
On 30 January in 1992 Imad Zatara's father Hasan Zatara became the last victim of John Ausonius in Swedish media known as Lasermannen ("the Laser Man"). Hasan survived but was blinded in his right eye and lost the ability to speak.

Converted and redesignated 1 May 1968 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 43d Military Police Brigade. Reorganized and redesignated 1 May 1976 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43d Military Police Brigade.
One of the next major state activations came in 1978. The "Blizzard of '78" crippled the state and forced all units to be called to duty from 6–16 February 1978. The 43rd organized traffic control to allow engineers to perform snow removal. MP's were stationed throughout the downtown area to prevent looting. There had not been a statewide call up since the "Hurricane of '38", thirty-nine years earlier.
Global War on Terror.
Soldiers from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43rd Military Police Brigade, mobilized in April 2002, then deployed from Fort Dix, New Jersey, in May 2002 to the US Naval Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There they replaced the 89th Military Police Brigade as the new headquarters element for Joint Task Force – 160 (JTF-160). In early 2002, the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) established JTF-160 and JTF-170 to operate a detention and interrogation facility at the naval base. In November of the same year, the two task forces consolidated to become Joint Task Force – Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO). During this period, US military personnel from all five services planned and executed a mission to safely and humanely detain suspected terrorists. Soldiers redeployed in November/December 2002 and demobilized in January 2003. On 28 January 2003, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA) to Headquarters, JTF-160, for exceptionally meritorious achievement during the period 4 January – 31 October 2002.
Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Soldiers from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43rd Military Police Brigade, mobilized in August 2005, deploying to Iraq. The mission was to provide Command and Control (C2) for all Theater Internment Facilities (TIF) in support of Task Force 134 and Multi-National Force – Iraq. Additionally the brigade managed the training and integration of Iraqi Corrections Officers and initiated the transfer of authority for all TIF's to the government of Iraq in support of UNSCR 1546. While deployed, the brigade commanded five MP battalions, twenty-three companies, two brigade liaison detachments, and two coalition forces detachments totaling approximately 5,000 assigned soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coalition forces at five separate detention facilities throughout the country. The 43rd oversaw the closure of the Abu Ghraib TIF in July 2006, built a new detention facility at Camp Cropper, and expanded Camp Bucca making it the largest detention facility in the world. The 43rd MP Bde was also responsible for the development of the Iraqi Corrections Officer Academy, which trained over 1600 Iraqi Correction Officers.The 43rd Military Police Brigade was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation for "Exceptionally Meritorious Service" during combat operations.
Operation Enduring Freedom.
Soldiers from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43rd Military Police Brigade, mobilized in March 2011, deploying to Afghanistan. The unit had control of detention operations along with the Afghan National Police at Bagram Airbase. They returned home to Rhode Island on 7 March 2012.
Shoulder Sleeve Insignia.
The shoulder sleeve insignia was approved on 16 May 1969, consisting of a green shield with a yellow wall of two crenelles above three green wavy bars, issuing from base and surmounted overall a white pike all within a yellow border. The fortification above the wavy bars alludes to the wall surrounding the 15th century city of Rhodes, capital of the Island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean after which Rhode Island was named. The wavy bars also represent Narragansett Bay and the many waterways of the state. The pike, any early weapon used by guards symbolizes the 43d Military Police Brigade's ability to give protection and strong support.

Mongoloid

Mongoloid refers to populations that share certain phenotypic traits such as epicanthic fold and other physical traits common in most of Asia (including Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, Siberia and parts of South Asia and West Asia), the Arctic, the Americas and most of the Pacific Islands. In terms of population, they are the most numerous race – more than one third of the human race.
The word is formed by the base word "Mongol" and the suffix "-oid" which means "resembling", so therefore the term literally means "resembling Mongols". It was introduced by early ethnology primarily to describe various central and east Asian populations, one of the proposed three major races of humanity. Although some forensic anthropologists and other scientists continue to use the term in some contexts (such as criminal justice), the term mongoloid is now considered derogatory by most anthropologists due to its association with disputed typological models of racial classification. Asian proponents of the same or similar concept have used the term East Asian race to refer to people of East Asian descent that only include people from Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, which makes up only a section of the Asian people.
Populations included.
The term "Mongoloid" comes from the Mongol people who caused great terror throughout Eurasia during the Mongol Empire invasions, and the new appearance of the Mongols and paranoia was used throughout the Western world to create a new racial classification. The words "Mongol", "Mongolian", "Mongoloid" were extensively used throughout European history since the 13th century usually in a negative manner. However in the modern sense, "Mongol" refers to the Mongol ethnic group and "Mongolian" refers to something related with the country of Mongolia not necessarily in terms of ethnicity. The first use of the term "Mongolian race" was by Christoph Meiners in a "binary racial scheme". His "two races" were labeled "Tartar-Caucasians", which comprised Celtic and Slavic groups, and "Mongolians".
Johann Friedrich Blumenbach said he borrowed the term "Mongolian" from Christoph Meiners to describe the race he designated "second, includes that part of Asia beyond the Ganges and below the river Amoor [Amur, which looks toward the south, together with the islands and the greater part of these countries which is now called Australian".
In 1861, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire added the Australian as a secondary race (subrace) of the principal race of Mongolian. In the nineteenth century Georges Cuvier used the term "Mongolian" again as a racial classification, but additionally included American Indians under the term. Arthur de Gobineau defined the extent of the Mongolian race, "by the yellow the Altaic, Mongol, Finnish and Tartar branches". Later, Thomas Huxley used the term "Mongoloid" and included American Indians as well as Arctic Native Americans. Other nomenclatures were proposed, such as "Mesochroi" (middle color), but "Mongoloid" was widely adopted.
In 1940, anthropologist Franz Boas included the American race as part of the Mongoloid race of which he mentioned the Aztecs of Mexico and the Maya of Yucatan. Boas also said that, out of the races of the Old World, the American native had features most similar to the east Asiatic.
In 1983, Douglas J. Futuyma, professor of evolutionary processes at the University of Michigan, said that the inclusion of Native Americans and Pacific Islanders under the Mongoloid race was not recognized by many anthropologists who consider them distinct races.
In 1984, Roger J. Lederer Professor of Biological Sciences at the California State University at Chico, separately listed the Mongoloid race from Pacific islanders and American Indians when he enumerated the "geographical variants of the same species known as races... we recognize several races Inuit, American Indians, Mongoloid... Polynesian".
In 1995, Dr. Marta Mirazon Lahr of the Department of Biological Anthropology at Cambridge University said all Asian populations are grouped under the name "Mongoloid".
In 1998, Jack D. Forbes, professor of Native American Studies and Anthropology at the University of California, Davis, said that the racial type of the indigenous people of the Americas does not fall into the Mongoloid racial category. Forbes said that due to the various physical traits indigenous Americans exhibit, some with "head shapes which seem hardly distinct from many Europeans", indigenous Americans must have either been formed from a mixture of Mongoloid and Caucasoid races or they descend from the ancestral, common type of both Mongoloid and Caucasoid races.
Of Europeans, Finns were previously considered by some scholars to be partly mongoloid, dating to claims by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach. This is no longer the case as Finns are considered typically European. Finns show very little if any Mediterranean and African genes but on the other hand almost 10% of Finnish genes seem to be shared with Siberian populations. Nevertheless more than 80% of Finnish genes are from a single ancient Northeastern European population, while most Europeans are a mixture of 3 or more principal components.
Subraces.
[[File:Meyers b11 s0476a.jpg|thumb|"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon "(1885–90).
The Mongoloid race sees the widest geographic distribution, including all of the Americas, Siberia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia, the entire inhabited Arctic while they form most of Central Asia and the Pacific Islands and significant parts of South Asia with exceptions on the other continents such as the countries of Turkey, Finland, Estonia, Hungary and Madagascar.
In 1900, Joseph Deniker said the "Mongol race admits two varieties or subraces: Tunguse or Northern Mongolian... and Southern Mongolian".
In the 1944 edition of Rand McNally's World Atlas, the three subraces of the Mongolian race are depicted as being the Mongolian race proper, the Malayan race, and the American Indian race.
Archaeologist Peter Bellwood claims that the vast majority of people in Southeast Asia, the region he calls the "clinal Mongoloid-Australoid zone", are Southern Mongoloids but have a high degree of Australoid admixture.
Professor of anthropology, Akazawa Takeru (Japanese:赤沢威) at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, Kyoto, said that there are Neo-Mongoloids and Paleo-Mongoloids. Akazawa said Neo-Mongoloids have "extreme Mongoloid, cold-adapted features" and they include the Chinese, Buryats, Eskimo and Chukchi. In contrast, Akazawa said Paleo-Mongoloids are less Mongoloid and less cold-adapted. He said Burmese, Filipinos, Polynesians, Jōmon and the indigenous peoples of the Americas were Paleo-Mongoloid.
History of the concept.
The earliest systematic use of the term was by Blumenbach in "De generis humani varietate nativa" ("On the Natural Variety of Mankind", University of Göttingen, first published in 1775, re-issued with alteration of the title-page in 1776). Blumenbach included East and South East Asians, but not Native Americans or Malays, who were each assigned separate categories.
In 1865, biologist Thomas Huxley presented the views of polygenesists (Huxley was not one of them) as "some imagine their assumed species of mankind were created where we find them... the Mongolians from the Orangs".
In 1972, physical anthropologist Carleton Coon said, "From a hyborean group there evolved, in northern Asia, the ancestral strain of the entire specialized Mongoloid family". In 1962, Coon believed that the Mongoloid "subspecies" existed "during most of the Pleistocene, from 500,000 to 10,000 years ago". According to Coon, the Mongoloid race had not completed its "invasions and expansions" into Southeast Asia, the Americas, and the Pacific Islands until "[toward the end of the Pleistocene". By this time Coon hypothesis that the Mongoloid race had become "sapien".
Paleo-anthropologist Milford Wolpoff and Rachel Caspari characterize "his Coon's contention being that the Mongoloid race crossed the 'sapiens threshold' first and thereby evolved the furthest".
Mohinder Kumar Bhasin (Hindi: महेंद्र कुमार भसीन) of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Delhi suggested in a review of an article referencing Mourant 1983 that "The Caucasoids and the Mongoloid almost certainly became differentiated from one another somewhere in Asia" and that "Another differentiation, which probably took place in Asia, is that of the Australoids, perhaps from a common type before the separation of the Mongoloids".
Douglas J. Futuyma, professor of evolutionary processes at the University of Michigan, said the Mongoloid race "diverged 41,000 years ago" from a Mongoloid and Caucasoid group which diverged from Negroids "110,000 years ago".
In 1996, professor of anthropology, Akazawa Takeru (Japanese:赤沢威) of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, Kyoto, said Mongoloids originated in Xinjiang during the "Ice Age".
In 1999, Peter Brown of the Department of Anthropology and Paleoanthropology at the University of New England evaluated three sites with early East Asian modern human skeletal remains (Liujiang, Liuzhou, Guangxi, China; Shandingdong Man of (but not Peking Man) Zhoukoudian's Upper Cave; and Minatogawa in Okinawa) dated to between 10,175 to 33,200 years ago, and finds lack of support for the conventional designation of skeletons from this period as "Proto-Mongoloid"; this would make Neolithic sites 5500 to 7000 years ago (e.g. Banpo) the oldest known Mongoloid remains in East Asia, younger than some in the Americas. He concludes that the origin of the Mongoloid phenotype remains unknown, and could even lie in the New World.
The human fossil remains of the Ordos Man from Salawusu site in Inner Mongolia dated between 50,000 and 35,000 BCE show strong Mongoloid features, specifically on the fore-tooth and occipital bone.
In 2006, Yali Xue () et al. of the genome research Sanger Institute conducted a study of linkage disequilibrium that found that northern populations in East Asia started to expand in number between 34 and 22 thousand years ago, before the last glacial maximum at 21–18 KYA, while southern populations
started to expand between 18 and 12 KYA, but then grew faster, and suggests that the northern populations expanded earlier because they could exploit the abundant megafauna of the "Mammoth Steppe", while the southern populations could increase in number only when a warmer and more stable climate led to more plentiful plant resources such as tubers.
In 2008, Juan Frijolé Reixach professor of cultural anthropology at the University of Barcelona showcased the racial classification systems of Carleton S. Coon and H.V. Vallois in his 2008 book series about human races. Reixach said Vallois said the "Yellow Race" included the following groups: Siberian, North Mongoloid, Central Mongoloid, South Mongoloid, Indonesian, Polynesian, Eskimo and Amerindian.
Features.
In 2004, forensic anthropologist Caroline Wilkenson said Mongoloids are characterized by absent browridges. R.G. Ong of the Department of Oral Radiology, Perth Dental Hospital, Australia found that Mongoloid subjects had about "20% higher bone density at the angle of the mandible" when compared to Caucasoid subjects.
Louis R. Sullivan, Curator of Physical Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History, said Samoans are of the Mongoloid race but their features represent a "slightly different evolution since the time of their separation and isolation from their parental stock" or a retention of features that have been lost in other Mongoloid types. Sullivan said the wavy and wooly hair of the Samoan is one such retention compared to the stiff, coarse hair that typifies the Mongoloid. Sullivan lists most of the characteristics of the Samoan as having Mongoloid affinities such as: skin color, hair color, eye color, conjuctiva, amount of beard, hair on chest, nasal bridge, nostrils, lips, face width, biogonial width, cephalo-facial index, nasal height, ear height and chin.
Dr. Rukang Wu () of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, said Mongoloid features are a mesocranic skull, fairly large and protruding cheekbones, nasal bones that are flat and broad, a nasal bridge that is slightly concave without depression in the nasion, "the lower borders of the piriform aperature are not sharp but guttered", shallow prenasal fossae, small anterior nasal spine, trace amounts of canine fossae and moderate alveolar prognathism.
Dr. Marta Mirazon Lahr of the Department of Biological Anthropology at Cambridge University said the Paleoindian has proto-Mongoloid morphology such as pronounced development of supraorbital ridges low frontals, marked post-orbital constriction, prominent and protruding occipitals, small mastoids, long crania and a relatively narrow bizygomatic breadth.
In 1882, Irish anthropologist Augustus Henry Keane who was professor at University College, London, said that the features of the Japanese that "attest their relationship with the great Mongolian family" are slightly oblique eyes, small nose, black lank hair, sparse beard, salient cheek-bones and yellowish complexion.
Shunsuke Yuzuriha (Japanese:杠俊介) et al. of Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan, said the Mongoloid eyelid is characterized by puffiness of the upper eyelid, "superficial expansion of the levator aponeurosis" that are "turned up around this transverse ligament to become the orbital septum", "low position of the preaponeurotic fat" and narrowness of the palpebral fissure.
Theodore G. Schurr of the Department of Anthropology at University of Pennsylvania said the Mongoloid racial type is distinguished by forward-projecting malar (cheek) bones, comparatively flat faces, large circular orbits, "moderate nasal aperture with a slightly pointed lower margin", larger, more gracile braincase, broader skull, broader face and flatter roof of the nose.
Akazawa said Mongoloid skin has thick skin cuticle and an abundance of carotene (yellow pigment). Rodney P.R. Dawber of the Oxford Hair Foundation and Clinical Lecturer in Dermatology said Mongoloid males have "little or no facial or body hair". Mildred Trotter of the School of Medicine St. Louis Missouri said Mongoloid hair is coarse, straight, blue-black and weighs the most out of the races. Mildred Trotter of the School of Medicine St. Louis Missouri and Oliver H. Duggins of the Department of Anatomy Washington University said the size of the average Mongoloid hair is based on samples from Chinese, North and South American Indians, Eskimos and Thais. Daniel Hrdy of the Department of Anthropology at Harvard University said that Mongoloid hair whether it be Sioux, Ifugao or Japanese has the thickest diameter out of all human hair. Professor of anthropology, Akazawa Takeru (Japanese:赤沢威) of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, Kyoto, said Mongoloids evolved hairlessness to keep clean while wearing heavy garments for months without bathing during the Ice Age.
In 1996, Rebecca Haydenblit of the Hominid Evolutionary Biology Research Group at Cambridge University did a study on the dentition of four pre-Columbian Mesoamerican populations and compared their data to other Mongoloid populations. She found that Tlatilco, Cuicuilco, Monte Albán and Cholula populations followed an overall Sundadont dental pattern characteristic of Southeast Asia rather than a Sinodont dental pattern characteristic of Northeast Asia.
Robert B. Pickering Professor of Anthropology at the University of Tulsa said the traits of the Mongoloid skull are: long and broad skulls of intermediate height, arched sagittal contour, very wide facial contour, high face height, rounded orbital opening, narrow nasal opening, wide, flat nasal bones, sharp lower nasal margin, straight facial profile, moderate and white palate shape, 90%+ shovel-shaped incisors and large, smooth general form.
Miquel Hernández of the Department of Animal Biology at the University of Barcelona said East Asians (Kyushu, Atayal, Philippines, Chinese, Hokkaido and Anyang) and Amerinds (Yaujos, Santa Cruz and Arikara) have the typical Mongoloid cranial pattern, but other Mongoloids such as Pacific groups (Easter Island, Mokapu, Guam and Moriori people), arctic groups (Eskimos and Buriats), Fuegians (Selk’nam, Ya´mana, Kawe´skar) and the Ainu differ from this by having "larger cranial dimensions over many variables".
Proto-Mongoloids.
Anthropologist Elsie Clews Parsons physical features of the Proto-Mongoloid were characterized as, "a straight-haired type, medium in complexion, jaw protrusion, nose-breadth, and inclining probably to round-headedness".
Margaret Sleeboom-Faulkner of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Sussex said Kanzō Umehara considered the Ainu and Ryukyuans to have "preserved their proto-Mongoloid traits".
Mark J. Hudson Professor of Anthropology at Nishikyushu University, Kanzaki, Saga, Japan, said Japan was settled by a Proto-Mongoloid population in the Pleistocene who became the Jōmon and their features can be seen in the Ainu and Okinawan people. Hudson said that, later, during the Yayoi period, the Neo-Mongoloid type entered Japan. Hudson said genetically Japanese people are primarily Neo-Mongoloid with Proto-Mongoloid admixture.
Theodore G. Schurr of the Department of Anthropology at University of Pennsylvania said Mongoloid traits emerged from Transbaikalia, central and eastern regions of Mongolia, and several regions of Northern China. Schurr said that studies of cranio-facial variation in Mongolia suggest that the region of modern-day Mongolians is the origin of the Mongoloid racial type".
Dr. Rukang Wu () of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology, Academia Sinica, China, said that the remains of Liukiang human fossils were an early type of evolving Mongoloid that indicated South China was the birthplace where the Mongoloid race originated.
Dr. Marta Mirazon Lahr of the Department of Biological Anthropology at Cambridge University said there are two hypotheses on the origin of Mongoloids. Lahr said one hypothesis is that Mongoloids originated in north Asia due to the regional continuity in this region and this population conforming best to the standard Mongoloid features. Lahr said the other hypothesis is that Mongoloids originate from Southeast Asian populations that expanded from Africa to Southeast Asia during the first half of the Upper Pleistocene and then traveled to Australia-Melanesia and East Asia. Lahr said the morphology of the Paleoindian is consistent with the proto-Mongoloid definition.
Anthropologist Arnold Henry Savage Landor described the Ainu as having deep-set eyes and an eye shape typical of Europeans, with a large and prominent browridge, large ears, hairy and prone to baldness, slightly-flattened hook nose with large and broad nostrils, prominent cheek bones, large mouth and thick lips and a long region from nose to mouth and small chin region.
Neoteny.
"Mongoloid skulls are the most gracile in the human family. It is believed that the Mongoloid skull type is a very recent evolutionary development." According to Ashley Montagu who taught anthropology at Princeton University, "The Mongoloid skull has proceeded further than in any other people", "The Mongoloid skull, whether Chinese or Japanese, has been rather more neotenized than the Caucasoid or European" and "The female skull, it will be noted, is more pedomorphic in all human populations than the male skull". In his list of "structural traits in which Mongoloids... differ from Caucasoids", Montagu lists "Larger brain, larger braincase, broader skull, broader face, flat roof of the nose, inner eye fold, more protuberant eyes, lack of brow ridges, greater delicacy of bones, shallow mandibular fossa, small mastoid processes, stocky build, persistence of thymus gland into adult life, persistence of juvenile form of zygomatic muscle, persistence of juvenile form of superior lip muscle, later eruption of full dentition (except second and third molars), less hairy, fewer sweat glands, fewer hairs per square centimeter [and long torso".
According to Clive Bromhall who has a Ph.D. in zoology from Oxford University, "Mongoloid races are explained in terms of being the most extreme pedomorphic humans".
Richard Grossinger, professor of anthropology at University of Maine at Portland, said "The intuition that advanced human development was pedomorphic rather than recapitulationary and accelerated was disturbing to many Eurocentric nineteenth century anthropologists". "If juvenilization was the characteristic for advanced status, then it was clear that the Mongoloid races were more deeply fetalized in most respects and thus capable of the greatest development".
Stephen Oppenheimer of the Institute of Cognitive & Evolutionary Anthropology at Oxford University said "An interesting hypothesis put forward by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould many years ago was that the package of the Mongoloid anatomical changes could be explained by the phenomenon of neoteny, whereby an infantile or childlike body form is preserved in adult life. Neoteny in hominids is still one of the simplest explanations of how we developed a disproportionately large brain so rapidly over the past few million years. The relatively large brain and the forward rotation of the skull on the spinal column, and body hair loss, both characteristic of humans, are found in foetal chimps. Gould suggested a mild intensification of neoteny in Mongoloids, in whom it has been given the name pedomorphy. Such a mechanism is likely to involve only a few controller genes and could therefore happen over a relatively short evolutionary period. It would also explain how the counterintuitive retrousse up at the end nose and relative loss of facial hair got into the package". "ecrease unnecessary muscle bulk, less tooth mass, thinner bones and smaller physical size; ...this follows the selective adaptive model of Mongoloid evolution".
Cold adaption.
Professor of anthropology, Akazawa Takeru (Japanese:赤沢威) of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in Kyoto Japan, said Mongoloid features are an adaption to the cold of the Mammoth steppe. He mentions the Lewis waves of warm blood cyclical vasodilation and vasoconstriction of the peripheral capillaries in Mongoloids as an adaption to the cold. He lists the short limbs, short noses, flat faces, epicanthic fold and lower surface to mass ratio as further Mongoloid adaptions to cold.
Takasaki Yuji (Japanese:高崎裕治) of Akita University, Japan, in the Journal of Physiological Anthropology and Applied Human Science said, "Mongoloid ancestors had evolved over time in cold environments" and the short limbs of the Mongoloid was due to Allen's ecological rule.
Professor of anthropology at Trent University Ontario, Canada, Joseph K. So () (198) cited a study by J. T. Steegman (1965) that the so-called cold-adapted Mongoloid face has been shown in an experiment, using Japanese and European subjects, to not offer greater protection to frostbite. In explaining Mongoloid cold-adaptiveness, So () cites the work of W. L. Hylander (1977) where Hylander said that in the Eskimo, for example, the reduction of the brow ridge and flatness of the face is due to internal structural configurations that are cold adapted in the sense that they produce a large vertical bite force necessary to chew frozen seal meat.
Miquel Hernández of the Department of Animal Biology at the University of Barcelona said the high and narrow nose of Eskimos and Neanderthals is an adaption to a cold and dry environment, since it contributes to warming and moisturizing the air and the "recovery of heat and moisture from expired air".
A.T. Steegman of the Department of Anthropology at State University of New York investigated the assumption that Allen's rule caused the structural configuration of the Arctic Mongoloid face. Steegman did an experiment that involved the survival of rats in the cold. Steegman found the rats with narrow nasal passages, broader faces, shorter tails and shorter legs survived the best in the cold. Steegman paralleled his findings with the Arctic Mongoloids, particularly the Eskimo and Aleut, by claiming these Arctic Mongoloids have similar features in accordance with Allen's rule: a narrow nasal passage, relatively large heads, long to round heads, large jaws, relatively large bodies, and short limbs.
Kenneth L. Beals of the Department of Anthropology at Oregon State University noted that the indigenous people of the Americas have cephalic indexes that are an exception to Allen's rule, since the indigenous people of the hot climates of North and South America have cold-adapted, high cephalic indexes. Beals explanation is that these peoples have not yet evolved the appropriate cephalic index for their climate, being, comparatively, only recently descended from the cold-adapted Arctic Mongoloid.
Genetic research.
In 1994, geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza of Stanford University divided a principal coordinant map of 42 Asian populations into three groupings: Asian Caucasoids, Northeast and East Asian and Southeast Asian. Along Southeast Asia, Cavalli-Sforza said there is a separation between northern and southern Mongoloids. To the West, Cavalli-Sforza said there is an approximate boundary between Caucasoids and Mongoloids from the Urals to the eastern part of India. Along this boundary there has been hybridization, causing a Caucasoid-Mongoloid gradient. More specifically, the ethnic groups Cavalli-Sforza said were in the Northeast and East Asian cluster were the Koryak, Chukchi, Reindeer Chukchi, Nganasan Samoyed, Northern Tungus, Nentsy, N. Chinese, Tibetan, Bhutanese, Ainu, Mongol, Japanese and Korean. Moving south, the ethnic groups Cavalli-Sforza said were in the Southeast Asian cluster were the Indonesian, Malaysian, Taiwan aborigines, Muong people, Thai, Filipino, S. Chinese, Balinese and Gurkha. Other studies also show that S. Chinese being an intermediate between the N. Chinese and Southeast Asian. Moving off the coast, Cavalli-Sforza said there are Australoid and Negrito peoples, but also that the Polynesians are a diluted Mongoloid type, the Negritos of the Andaman Islands and Semang Negritos have a high frequency of the Mongoloid inner epicanthic eyefold and that among Australoid Micronesians some individuals look more Mongoloid. Moving to the Americas, Cavalli-Sforza said the Eskimos and Aleuts derived from the Siberian Mongoloids and came after the American Indians who are both Mongoloid in general and uniform racially.
In 2008, biochemist Boris Abramovich Malyarchuk () et al. of the Institute of Biological Problems of the North, Russian Academy of Sciences, Magadan, Russia, used a sample (n=279) of Czech individuals to determine the frequency of Mongoloid mtDNA lineages. Malyarchuk found Czech mtDNA lineages were typical of Slavic populations with 1.8% Mongoloid mtDNA lineage. Malyarchuk added that Slavic populations almost always contain Mongoloid mtDNA lineage. Malyarchuk said the Mongoloid component of Slavic people was partially added before the split of Balto-Slavics in 2,000–3,000 BCE with additional Mongoloid mixture occurring among Slavics in the last 4,000 years. Malyarchuk said the Russian population was developed by the assimilation of the indigenous pre-Slavic population of Eastern Europe by true Slavs with additional assimilation of Finno-Ugric populations and long-lasting interactions with the populations of Siberia and Central Asia. Malyarchuk said that other Slavs Mongoloid component was increased during the waves of migration from steppe populations (Huns, Avars, Bulgars and Mongols), especially the decay of the Avar Khaganate.
In 1999, Vladimir Orekhov () et al. of the Institute of General Genetics, Moscow, Russia, found that there is evidence for influence of Mongoloid populations on the ethnogenesis of Russians due to the presence of mytotypes 26, 33, and 47 of Mongoloid haplogroup C in the Russian population as well as evidence for Finno-Ugric populations in the ethnogenesis of Eastern Slavs due to the presence of Finno-Ugric mitotype (mitotype 31) in the Russian population, but he found that that Russian mtDNA pools differed by Russian regions with Russians of the Eastern-European plain close to European ethnic groups.
Atsushi Tajima (Japanese: 田嶋敦) et al. of Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan, found evidence for four separate populations, carrying distinct sets of non-recombining Y chromosome lineages, within the traditional Mongoloid category: North Asians, Han Chinese, Southeast Asians, and Japanese.
In 1997, Masatoshi Nei (Japanese: 根井正利), Professor of Biology at Pennsylvania State University, said clusters of genetic distances conform to the customary three major races of man, namely, Negroids, Caucasoids and Mongoloids. Moreover, Nei said that Mongoloid populations irrespective of north and south show small genetic distances from any populations in Oceania and Americas. Nei said the Northern Mongoloid included the Evens, Buryat, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Japanese, Ainu, Northern Chinese and Korean. In the Southern Mongoloid, Nei included the Dong, Zhuang, Southern Chinese, Taiwanese-aborigines, Thai, Indonesian and Filipino. Based on genetic data, Nei said the Amerindians descend from two populations: an original Northeast Asians migration which became the Paleo-Indian and a later migration which became both the Na-Dene and Eskimos. Based on the genetic data, Nei said Southeast Asian Mongoloids are closer to the Micronesian and Polynesian than to the Papuan and Australian. In 1993, Nei said the Mongoloids were contained within a larger genetic grouping called the Greater Asians or Greater Mongoloids which also included Pacific Islanders and Australopapuans. In the Australopapuan grouping, Nei included Dravidians, Andamanese, Australian, Papuan and Philippine Negritos. Since Nei found Australopapuans were most closely related to East Asians, Nei offered an explanation for their peculiar traits. Nei rejected the hypothesis that Australopapuans have traits of black Africans due to convergent-evolution, since he estimated it would have taken far longer for them to have re-evolved frizzled-hair. Nei supported the other hypothesis put forward by Chris B. Stringer of the Paleontology Department of the Natural History Museum that there were two populations and that the original African population had absorbed most of its gene pool from the Mongoloid group.
Satoshi Horai (Japanese: 宝来聡) of the Japanese National Institute of Genetics, said phylogenetic analysis indicated that the there are two distinct groups of Mongoloids – one which early on diverged from Negroids and another that diverged from Caucasoids later. Horai said Mongoloid distribution corresponds to North and South America, Oceania, Southeast Asia, east Asia, and Siberia.
A study conducted by the HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium in 2009 used principal components analysis, which makes no prior population assumptions, on genetic data sampled from a large number of points across Asia. They found that East Asian and South-East Asian populations clustered together, and suggested a common origin for these populations. At the same time they observed a broad discontinuity between this cluster and South Asia, commenting most of the Indian populations showed evidence of shared ancestry with European populations. It was noted that genetic ancestry is strongly correlated with linguistic affiliations as well as geography.
In 2010, Sung-Soo Hung et al. (Korean:윤승수) of the Department of Biology at Seoul National University found that Mongoloids were relatively homogenous in 9-bp deletion type of the mtDNA COM/ tRNALys intergenic region.
Criticism.
Dr. George W. Gill, professor of anthropology at the University of Wyoming and Dennis O'Neil professor of anthropology at Palomar College, said that "Mongoloid" concept originated with a now disputed typological method of racial classification. All the "-oid" racial terms (e.g. "Mongoloid", "Caucasoid", "Negroid", etc.) are now often controversial in both technical and non-technical contexts and may sometimes give offense no matter how they are used.
According to Ward O. Conner who wrote a book about John Langdon Down, since people with Down syndrome may have epicanthic folds, Down syndrome was widely called "Mongol" or "Mongoloid Idiocy". In slang usage the term came to be used as an insult. A shortened version of the term, "mong" or "mongol", is also used in the United Kingdom.
For many people of Asian descent the term "mongoloid" is highly offensive due to its use as a pejorative to describe people with Down's syndrome.

Beardmore W.B.1

The Beardmore W.B.1 was a British single-engine bomber biplane of World War I developed by Beardmore.
Development and design.
In 1916, George Tighman Richards, the newly appointed chief designer of the aviation department of the Scottish shipbuilder William Beardmore, designed his first aircraft for Beardmore, the W.B.1. This was to be a single engined bomber for the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), which was intended to carry out long gliding attacks to achieve surprise. It was a three-bay biplane with long span high aspect ratio wings, which were highly staggered. It was powered by a 230 hp (172 kW) BHP engine and first flew in early 1917. 
The W.B.1 was delivered to the RNAS at Cranwell for evaluation on 8 June 1917. By this time however, the larger and more capable Handley Page O/100 was in production and the W.B.1 was rejected by the RNAS.

Gaylussacia brachycera

Gaylussacia brachycera, commonly known as box huckleberry or box-leaved whortleberry, is a low North American shrub related to the blueberry and the other huckleberries. It is easily distinguished from other members of its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and ate the berries, before botanists became aware of them in the 1920s.
A relict species nearly exterminated by the last ice age, box huckleberry is self-sterile, and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to be as many as 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, which would make it the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.
Description.
Box huckleberry is a low shrub, tall. Its leaves resemble those of boxwood (hence its name). About long and oval-shaped, they are glossy and minutely toothed, turning red in winter. The evergreen leaves, lacking resin glands, are in sharp contrast to other species of "Gaylussacia". Box huckleberry flowers in May and June. The flowers are urn-shaped and white, sometimes tinged with pink. Like other huckleberries, the flowers appear on a raceme springing from the leaf axils. Its fruits, which appear in July and August, are blue berries borne on short pedicels.
Taxonomy.
Box huckleberry was first collected and described in 1796 near Winchester, Virginia (probably in what is now West Virginia) by the botanist André Michaux. Michaux named it "Vaccinium brachycerum" in his "Flora Boreali-Americana", published in 1803. Matthias Kinn, in about 1800, and Frederick Pursh, in 1805, also obtained specimens in West Virginia. R. A. Salisbury referred to it as "V. buxifolium" in 1805, and this remained the prevailing name for the next forty years; the common name "box-leaved whortle-berry" was used for the species at the time.
No further specimens were collected until 1845, when Spencer Baird, a professor at Dickinson College, discovered a colony near New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania. It was redesignated "G. brachycera" in 1846 by Asa Gray on the basis of Baird's specimens. ("Gaylussacia" was not recognized as a genus separate from "Vaccinium" until 1819.) The discovery brought about a friendship between Gray and Baird that ultimately resulted in the latter's appointment as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
John Kunkel Small assigned the species, as "Buxella brachycera", to a monospecific genus in 1933. However, this was not widely accepted, and was rejected by other authors on the grounds of both nomenclatural and "phyletic unsoundness". More recently, phylogenetic studies in 2002 suggested that the monophyly of "G. brachycera" with the remainder of "Gaylussacia" is "equivocal", and further analysis of "Vaccinium" might result in "G. brachycera" being returned to that genus.
Distribution and habitat.
About 100 separate stations for box huckleberry have been documented in the scientific literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant had been lost to science, and his Pennsylvania colony was the only one known for some time. Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M. Canby.
In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called attention to the threatened state of the plant in an article in "Science". While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.
This report stimulated considerable interest in the species. Additional colonies were located in Pennsylvania and Delaware, one in Maryland, several in Virginia, three in Tennessee (1920–1930), two in Kentucky (1927–1932), and many in West Virginia (1921). In summarizing these discoveries in 1932, Wherry noted that many of the colonies were already known to local residents, who picked the berries for food, under names such as "juniper-berry", "ground-huckleberry", and "bear-huckleberry". He called for more intensive effort on the part of the scientific community to make use of such local knowledge in determining plant geography. More recently, a colony of box huckleberry was discovered in Durham County, North Carolina, the first report from that state, in 2003.
Most of the reported stations for box huckleberry fall within the Appalachian Mountains, ranging from central Pennsylvania in the north to eastern Tennessee in the south. However, the specimens located in Maryland and Delaware were found on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and the single North Carolina station is in the Piedmont. Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America, but was almost eradicated by glacial advances, surviving only where it escaped the ice in protected refugia.
Box huckleberry prefers dry, acidic soils, including duff, and partial shade. Locations on wooded slopes tend to face north; however, the New Bloomfield site faces west. At one of the Delaware sites, a small portion of the colony extended to the wet margin of a marsh, but most was located on dry, sandy soil upslope.
Ecology and human use.
Box huckleberry is self-sterile, so single plants cannot reproduce sexually. Instead, they form colonies which spread by vegetative reproduction along rootstocks. A colony of "G. brachycera" at Losh Run, Pennsylvania was found to be long when surveyed. If this colony grew clonally from a seed deposited along the Juniata River at the rate of per year, it would be about 13,000 years old, the oldest living organism in the United States and second oldest in the world, eclipsed only by "Lomatia tasmanica". However, this is believed now to be an overestimate on climatic grounds. At that time, the site was covered by a boreal forest thought to be too cold for the box huckleberry to survive; the current forest did not begin to appear at the site until about 8,000 years ago. This age would still make it the oldest woody plant in North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Recent studies have attempted to determine whether, in fact, the reproduction of the colony (since heavily damaged by a forest fire in 1963 and road construction in the 1970s) has been entirely clonal. Two genotypes were found in samples taken from the colony, but they are thought to have arisen through somatic mutation rather than sexual reproduction. Unfortunately, the destruction of about 80% of the colony by fire and construction makes it impossible to definitively settle the question.
The caterpillar of the moth "Dichomeris juncidella" has been reported to feed on the leaves. The berries are eaten by Wild Turkeys and Ruffed Grouse. They have been harvested for food by humans in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Rev. Frederick W. Gray, who documented many of the box huckleberry colonies in West Virginia in the 1920s, first took an interest in the plant when served a "juniper" pie, "juniper" being the local name for box huckleberry. However, they are reportedly tasteless.
With the cooperation of the United States Department of Agriculture, efforts are under way to promote "G. brachycera" as a groundcover for use in landscaping. Box huckleberry is commercially available from at least one source but it is difficult to propagate, making it unprofitable for many nurseries to carry. In New Bloomfield, PA, the box huckleberry has become part of the local New Year's celebrations, as a papier-mâché replica of a huckleberry is dropped, instead of a ball, to mark the new year.

Asian people

Asian people or Asiatic people are people who descend from a portion of Asia's population.
There are varieties of definition and geographical data presented by organizations and individuals for classifying the Asian people.
Definitions by country.
Anglophone Africa and Caribbean.
In parts of anglophone Africa, especially East Africa and South Africa, and in parts of the Anglophone Caribbean, the term "Asian" is more commonly associated with people of South Asian origin, particularly Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans.
Australia.
The Australian Census includes Central Asia. The Australian Census includes four regions of Asia in its official definition. Defined by the 2006–2011 Australian Census, three "broad groups" have the word Asian included in their name: "Central" "and Southern Asian", "South-East Asian" and "North-East Asian". Russians are classified as "Southern and Eastern Europeans" while Middle Easterners are classified as "North African and Middle Easterners".
Canada.
The Canadian Census uses the term 'Asian' pan-continentally and the list of visible minorities includes ""West Asian"", ""South Asian"", ""Central Asian"" and ""Southeast Asian"". The Canadian government uses "West Asian" in its statistics; however people from the Arab countries of Western Asia are counted in a separate "Arab" category.
New Zealand.
New Zealand's census undertaken by Statistics New Zealand defines the Asian to include people of Chinese, Indian, Korean, Filipino, Japanese, Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Cambodian and Thai ancestries. In less formal contexts, the term "Asian" often does not include South Asian people.
Norway.
Statistics Norway uses the term 'Asian' pan-continentally and considers people of Asian background to be people from all Asian countries.
United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, the term "Asian" is more commonly associated with people of South Asian origin, particularly Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans. The UK usage of the term "Asian" is reflected in the "ethnic group" section of UK census forms, which treat "Asian" and "Chinese" as separate (see British Asian). Most respondents to the UK 2001 Census of non-Chinese East Asian and Southeast Asian descent chose to write-in their ethnicity in the "Other Ethnic Group" category rather than the "Other Asian" category, reflecting the association of the word Asian in the UK with South Asian. Despite there being a strong presence of East Asians in the United Kingdom there are considerably more South Asians, for example the 2001 Census recorded 1.05 million people of Indian origin and 247,000 of Chinese origin in the UK. Peter J. Aspinall of the Centre for Health Services Studies, University of Kent, recommends privileging the term "South Asian" over the term "Asian", since the term "Asian" is a "contested term".
United States.
In 1968, an Asian activist conference decided on favoring the name "Asian American" over the competing terms: "yellow", "Mongolian", "Asiatic" and "Oriental", since the Filipinos at the meeting thought they were "brown" rather than "yellow" and the conference thought the term "Oriental" was Eurocentric, since they originate from lands "east" only from Europe's standpoint and, since the term "Oriental" suggested to them "passivity".
Earlier Census forms from 1980 and prior listed particular Asian ancestries as separate groups along with "White" and "Black or Negro". Previously, Asian Americans were classified as "other".
The 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census Bureau definition of the Asian "race" includes those who originate from the original peoples of the "Far East", "Southeast Asia" and the "Indian subcontinent".
In 1930 and 1940, "Indian Americans" were identified as a separate race, "Hindu", and in 1950 and 1960 they were racially classified as "Other Race", and then in 1970 they were classified as "White". Since 1980, Indians and all other South Asians have been classified as part of the Asian race. Sociologist Madhulika Khandelwal described how ""...as a result of activism, South Asians came to be included as 'Asians' in the census only in the 80's. Prior to that many South Asians had been checking 'Caucasian' or 'Other'.""
Respondents can also report their specific ancestry, e.g.: Okinawan, etc. Someone reporting these ancestries but no race would be classified as "Asian". Unlike South Asians, Jewish Americans (see also: Israeli Americans), Arab Americans, Iranian Americans and Central Asian Americans have not lobbied to be included as Asians by the U.S. Census Board.
In normal American usage Asian does not refer to the people from the Pacific Islands who are usually called Pacific Islanders.
However, in the 2000 US Census, the Asian or Pacific Islander category was separated into two categories, "Asian" and "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander".
Definition by non-government sources.
Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza.
In 1994, geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza of Stanford University divided a principal coordinant map of 42 Asian populations into three groupings: Asian Caucasoids, Northeast and East Asian and Southeast Asian. The ethnic groups Cavalli-Sforza said were in the "Asian Caucasoids" cluster were the Armenian, Arabian, Assyrian, Lebanese, Bedouin, Jordanian, E. Iranian, W. Iranian, Uzbek, N. Turkic, Turkish Caucasoid, Turkmen, Brahman, Central Indian, E. Indian, S. Indian, N. Dravidian, Central Dravidian, S. Dravidian and Sri Lankan. The ethnic groups Cavalli-Sforza said were in the Northeast and East Asian cluster were the Koryak, Chukchi, Reindeer Chukchi, Nganasan Samoyed, N. Tungus, Nentsy, N. Chinese, Tibetan, Bhutanese, Ainu, Mongol, Japanese and Korean. The ethnic groups Cavalli-Sforza said were in the Southeast Asian cluster were Indonesian, Malaysian, Taiwan aborigines, Viet Muong, Thai, Philippine, S. Chinese, Balinese and Gurkha.
Moreover, Cavalli-Sforza said there is an approximate boundary between Caucasoids and Mongoloids from the Urals to the eastern part of India. Along this boundary there has been hybridization, causing a "Caucasoid-Mongoloid gradient". Likewise, Cavalli-Sforza said there is a "separation between northern and southern Mongoloids starting from Southeast Asia".
[[File:Asian race immigration region to America.png|thumb|300px|
Leonard Lieberman Professor of Anthropology at Central Michigan University said that the perception of there being a discrete Asian race in the mindset of America is due to immigration from the region circled in the picture, but Lieberman said the reality is that "not all Asians can be designated 'Mongoloid'".]]
Marta Mirazón Lahr.
Dr. Marta Mirazón Lahr of the Department of Biological Anthropology at Cambridge University said "all" "Asian populations" are "grouped under the name Mongoloid".
Michael Bamshad.
Michael Bamshad et al. of the Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah, found that "107 sub-Saharan African, 67 East Asian and 81 Western European" individuals genetically clustered with "ancestry from a single population" at levels of "almost 100%", but among "263 individuals from South India" the "proportion of ancestry shared with Europeans and Asians varies widely".
Karen T. Taylor.
Karen T. Taylor forensic art professor at the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia, said that the term "Asian-derived" is a modern-day euphemism for the "Mongoloid race" and it includes "Native Americans" and "various Asian groups".
Eugénia Maria Guedes Pinto Antunes da Cunha.
Eugénia Maria Guedes Pinto Antunes da Cunha of the Department of Anthropology, University of Coimbra, Portugal, said there has been a modern trend in "most of the forensic anthropology literature" to "rename" the term "Mongoloid", a term in which she includes the "North American Indian", with the term "Asian" or "Asiatic". Antunes da Cunha said that, even though the "terminology" has changed, the "underlying assumptions are the same".
Sandra Soo-Jin Lee.
Sandra Soo-Jin Lee (Korean:이수진) of the Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology at Stanford University, United States of America, said that the reasoning behind "Asian" being a "race" as defined by the US Census is "difficult to determine" because it includes "South Asians".
Konstantinos Moraitis.
Konstantinos Moraitis (Greek:Κωνσταντίνος Μωραΐτης) of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology School of Medicine, University of Athens, Greece, said that the "Asian" group which he also refers to as the "Mongoloid" group includes both "Far East" and "Native American" people.
Matt Cartmill.
Matt Cartmill of the Department of Biological Anthropology and Anatomy, Duke University, United States, said "geography has little to do with the race concept in its actual application", since "Asian individuals be born in the same geographical region" as other races.
Masniari Novita.
Masniari Novita of the Biomedical Department of Jember University, Jember, Indonesia, said "Asiatics" are part of the "Mongoloid" race while "Asians from the Indian Subcontinent" are part of the "Caucasian" race.
Willett Enos Rotzell.
Willett Enos Rotzell professor of Botany and Zoology at the Hahnemann Medical College used the term "Asian" "race" to refer to the race he alternatively called the "Yellow or Mongolian race".
Kyung-Ran Jung.
In 2007, Kyung-Ran Jung et al. (Korean:전경란) of the Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan, Seoul, South Korea used the term "Asian populations" for the group he also referred to as the "Asian-Mongoloid" in which he included Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Thai for a meta-analysis of alleles in relation to rheumatoid arthritis.
Physical features.
Sandy Sangrigoli et al. of the Laboratoire Cognition et Développement, Boulogne-Billancourt, France, used adults of Korean origin adopted by white families to test whether they were able to distinguish Caucasian faces at the level of a control group of French people who were shown to be better at distinguishing Caucasian faces than Asiatic faces. Sangrigoli found the Korean adoptees mirrored the control group by showing greater recognition of Caucasian than Asian faces, indicating the "other-race effect" of face recognition remains plastic in childhood.
Willett Enos Rotzell professor of Botany and Zoology at the Hahnemann Medical College said the Asian race has skin color ranging from a yellowish tint to an olive shade, with black and coarse hair with a circular cross section, an absent or scanty beard, a brachycephalic skull, prominent cheek bones and a broad face. Rotzell said the Asian race has its original home in Asia.
Konstantinos Moraitis (Greek:Κωνσταντίνος Μωραΐτης) of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology School of Medicine, University of Athens, Greece, said the Asian is distinguished by a flat face, rounded orbits, pronounced zygomatics and an intermediate nasal aperture and spine.
Dennis C. Dirkmaat professor of paleoanthropology and archaeology at Mercyhurst University said that Southeast Asian skulls can be distinguished from Asian and Native American skulls in that they are "smaller and less robust" with noses exhibiting a medium width without nasal overgrowth, and can "exhibit gracile features common to female skulls".
A 2009 study of facial detection technology found the technology incorrectly classified more "Mongoloids" or "Asian" male faces as females relative to its error rate for the "Caucasian... and Negroid races". Dirkmaat also said that body measurements of the "average Asian male" may fall within the range of those of the "American white female".
Asian fat distribution.
Qing He et al. of the Obesity Research Center at Columbia University did a study on "fat distribution" of 358 prepubertal children and found that Asians had less gynoid fat than African Americans and more relative trunk fat than Caucasians, but less relative extremity fat than Caucasians.
Victor H.H. Goh (Chinese:吴) et al. of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University of Singapore, did a study that found that the World Health Organization's obesity cut off based on body mass index misclassified the true obese in an Asian population by labeling 3.76 times more men and 1.64 times more women as obese than would actually be obese.
Asian noses.
Jeffrey Min Ahn (Korean:안민) professor at the College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia University, said that the "typical Asian nose" has "a broad low dorsum, decreased tip projection, thick, lobular skin, wide lobule, abundant subcutaneous fatty tissue, alar flaring, a retracted columella, and a small osteocartilaginous framework."
Eun-Sang Dhong (Korean:동은상) of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Korea University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, measured 52 alar cartilages of 26 Koreans and concluded that the alar cartilages" in Asians is not much smaller than whites.
Kyung-Wook Chun (Korean:전경욱) et al. of the Department of Plastic Surgery, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea, found using 20 cadavers that in "Asian noses" the size of the alar lobule is mainly due to the size of the dilator naris anterior muscle, the dilator naris posterior muscle and the "thickness of the external skin" rather than due to vestibular skin.
Asian eyes.
Sang-Ki Jeong (Korean:정상기) et al. of Chonnam University, Kwangju, Korea, using both Asian and Caucasian cadavers as well as four healthy young Korean men found "Asian eyelids" whether "Asian single eyelids" or "Asian double eyelids" had more fat in them than in Caucasians. Jeong et al. found that the cause of the "Asian single eyelid" was that "the orbital septum fuses to the levator aponeurosis at variable distances below the superior tarsal border; (2) preaponeurotic fat pad protusion and a thick subcutaneous fat layer prevent levator fibers from extending toward the skin near the superior tarsal border; and (3) the primary insertion of the levator aponeurosis into the orbicularis muscle and into the upper eyelid skin occurs closer to the eyelid margin in Asians."
Dae-Hwan Park (Korean:박대환) et al. of the Catholic University of Daegu, Gyeongsan, South Korea, used 498 "Asians" to study Asian eyes wherein he determined that in Asians the greatest growth of the "vertical dimension of the palpebral fissure", intercanthal distance and "the horizontal dimension of the palpebral fissure" were between 10 to 13 years old, 14 to 16 years old and 17 to 19 years old respectively.
Wee-Kiak Lim (Chinese:林伟杰) of the Singapore National Eye Centre found that the "Asian lower eyelid differs from its non-Asian counterpart" by having "no consistent fusion between the capsulopalpebral fascia and the orbital septum inferior to the inferior tarsal border" and "no extension of the capsulopalpebral fascia".
Asian teeth.
George Richard Scott, physical anthropologist at the University of Nevada, said some East Asians (in particular, Han Chinese and some Japanese), as well as Native Americans, have a distinctive dental pattern known as Sinodonty, where, among other features, the upper first two incisors are not aligned with the other teeth, but are rotated a few degrees inward and are shovel-shaped.
Asian DNA.
[[File:Human race genetic map Y chromosome.png|300px|thumb|right|
Rebecca Oakley and Chris Tyler-Smith of the Department of Biochemistry at Oxford University said that 90% of the Y chromosomes of "Asian" (including "Orientals") and European men in their sample (38/42) descend from one of two males. The Y chromosome type of Group 1 was only found in Caucasian or part Caucasian men, and the Y chromosome type of Group 2 was found in Caucasian and completely non-Caucasian men. The Y chromosome type of Group 2 was characterized by a large alphoid block containing the additional sites for A&I, EcoO1091, and HindIII, linked to a small poxY1 BgZII fragment.
Scott W. Ballinger et al. of the Department of Biochemistry at Emory University said "Asian mtDNA lineages" originated in Southern China with the "Southern Mongoloid".
Hiroki Oota et al. (Japanese:太田博樹) of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany, said "Asian populations" have high mtDNA variation with Vietnamese having the highest mtDNA diversity, but, overall, the genetic distance between "Asian populations" is small.
Melissa L. Cann et al. of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, said that early Asians did not mix with "Asian Homo and that the features of "ancient Asian forms" indicate that "Asian erectus" was not ancestral to "Homo sapiens". Since modern-day "Asians" do not show the amount of mtDNA divergence expected had they mixed with Homo erectus, Cann believes the expanding Homo sapiens from Africa replaced the Asian Homo erectus.
Douglas C. Wallace of the Department of Biochemistry at Emory University said the mtDNA of the indigenous peoples of the Americas is "clearly Asian in character", but the few founding females carried "rare Asian mtDNAs", causing a different frequency of mtDNA and a "dramatic founder effect".
Shama Barnabas, B. Joshi and C.G. Suresh of the Division of Biochemical Sciences, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India, said evidence for the original people of India who they refer to as the "proto-Asiatic element" spreading into Southeast Asia to become Southeast Asians is shown by the mtDNA affinities between Indians and East Asians and Southeast Asians in "Dde"I 10394 site along with the associated Asian-specific "Alu"I 10397 site.
A study by The HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium in 2009 found that East Asian and South-East Asian populations clustered together, and suggested a common origin for these populations. At the same time they observed a broad discontinuity between this cluster and South Asia, commenting "most of the Indian populations showed evidence of shared ancestry with European populations". It was noted that "genetic ancestry is strongly correlated with linguistic affiliations as well as geography".

United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2008

The 2008 congressional elections in New Jersey were held on November 4, 2008 to determine who would represent the state of New Jersey in the United States House of Representatives. New Jersey has thirteen seats in the House, apportioned according to the 2000 United States Census. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; those elected will serve in the 111th Congress from January 4, 2009 until January 3, 2011. The election coincided with the 2008 U.S. presidential election.
The statewide Party primary elections were held June 3, 2008.
District 3 was the only seat which changed party (from open Republican to Democratic), although CQ Politics had forecasted districts 3, 5 and 7 to be at some risk for the incumbent party.
District 1.
This district contains all or parts of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester counties. Rob Andrews was the Democratic nominee and the Saints Prison Ministry founder Dale Glading was the Republican nominee. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
Incumbent Democrat Rob Andrews, in a surprise move on April 2, 2008, announced that he would be challenging incumbent Sen. Frank Lautenberg in the Democratic primary in June. His House seat, which is reliably Democratic (CPVI: D+14), thus became an open seat. The filing deadline for primary candidates was April 7, leaving only a few days for candidates to declare.
Andrews' wife, Camille Andrews, won the Democratic primary for his seat in the House, while Andrews himself was beaten by Lautenberg in the Senate primary. After this defeat, Rob Andrews decided to run for re-election to his House seat; Camille withdrew her candidacy on September 3, and Rob Andrews announced that on September 4 that he would take her place as the Democratic candidate. He maintained that his wife had not been merely a placeholder candidate and said that he had only decided to run for re-election a week before he announced it; according to Andrews, his change of heart was a result of personal reflection.
Andrews easily won re-election on November 4, receiving 71.9% of the vote.
District 2.
This district lies in the southern part of the state, containing all or portions of Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May:
Cumberland, Gloucester and Salem counties. It has been represented by Republican Frank LoBiondo since 1995, and he ran for re-election in 2008. The Democratic nominee was Cape May city councilman Dave Kurkowski (campaign website). Other candidates included Green Jason Grover, Socialist Constantino Rozzo, Peter Boyce for the Constitution Party, and Independent Gary Stein. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'. 
LoBiondo defeated Kurkowski in the general election by a margin of almost 20%.
District 3.
This district contains all or portions of Burlington, Camden and Ocean counties. The Republican nominee was Chris Myers, Mayor of Medford, VP of Lockheed Martin, and Gulf War veteran. The Democratic nominee was State Senator John Adler, a candidate who faced an outsider disadvantage in that the only city that is in both the 3rd Congressional District and his legislative district is his home town of Cherry Hill. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'No Clear Favorite'.
Incumbent Republican Jim Saxton announced that he would retire at the end of his current term. This district is historically Republican, but George W. Bush barely won with 51% to 49% for John Kerry in 2004 (CPVI=D+3). Also, Al Gore won this district by a significant margin in 2000. Some Democrats think that Saxton had managed to keep his seat for so long (since 1984) because he rarely faced credible opposition. 
A mid-September internal poll by McLaughlin & Associates showed Myers defeating Adler by a margin of 33% to 29%, with a plurality of voters - 37% - undecided.
However, later polls indicated that the race was too close to call. 
In the closest congressional race in New Jersey in 2008, Adler narrowly won the open seat, with 51.7% of the vote to Myers' 48.3%. 
Many credit Adler's narrow victory to massive turnouts in liberal and African American towns such as Willingboro and Cherry Hill.
District 4.
This district lies in the central part of the state, including all or portions of Burlington County, Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean counties. It has been represented by Republican Chris Smith since 1981. The Democratic nominee was author and teacher Josh Zeitz (campaign website). CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'. 
Smith won re-election in a landslide, garnering about 100,000 more votes than his Democratic challenger.
District 5.
This district contains most of the Northern New Jersey Skylands Region of Sussex and Warren counties and stretches along the New York border into Northern Passaic and Bergen Counties, including the townships of Paramus and Ridgewood and tends to lean Republican. Republican incumbent Scott Garrett had been elected by safe margins in the past but in 2006 he only won by 10 points against Paul Aronsohn, the smallest margin of his career. The Democratic nominee was Rabbi Dennis Shulman. Garrett was the only incumbent in the state thought to possibly be at risk. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Republican Favored'. 
Shulman's campaign enjoyed a successful fundraising operation, heavy funding from the Democratic Party, extensive coverage in the press including newspaper endorsements, and the Democratic wave sweeping the nation as Barack Obama ran for president. However, Garrett was able to defeat Shulman by 14% in the general election and will begin his fourth term in the House of Representatives in 2009.
District 6.
This district lies in the east-central part of the state, including all or portions of Middlesex, Monmouth, Somerset and Union counties. It has been represented by Democrat Frank Pallone since 1993. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'. Republican Robert McLeod, a retired municipal prosecutor and municipal judge and former Keyport borough councilman, ran against Pallone, who was re-elected with about two-thirds of the vote.
District 7.
This district contains portions of Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset and Union counties. The Republican nominee was State Senator (and outgoing Senate Minority Leader) Leonard Lance of Hunterdon County. Assemblywoman Linda Stender was the Democratic nominee for the second consecutive election. Bridgewater Councilman Michael Hsing ran as an independent. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'No Clear Favorite'.
Republican Mike Ferguson barely won his re-election bid in 2006, edging state Assemblywoman Linda Stender by 50% to 48%. In a major surprise, Ferguson announced that he would not run for reelection. George W. Bush narrowly won this district with 53% to 46% for John Kerry in 2004 (CPVI=R+1). 
After a tight race in which the two candidates polled fairly evenly for a long time, debated each other twice, and received heavy funding from their respective parties, Lance won the election with 50.8% of the vote. 
District 8.
This district lies in the north-east part of the state, including all or portions of Essex and Passaic counties. It has been represented by Democrat Bill Pascrell since 1997. With Pascrell running for a seventh term, CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
The Republican nominee was Roland Straten, a professional engineer and United States Navy veteran from Paterson. 
In the general election, the heavily Democratic district gave 70.9% of the vote to Pascrell—a landslide on par with his 71% against Jose Sandoval in 2006. 
District 9.
This district lies in the north-east part of the state, including all or portions of Bergen and Hudson and Passaic counties. It has been represented by Democrat Steve Rothman since 1997, and in 2008 he announced that he would seek another term in Congress. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
The Republican nominee was Vince Micco, a retired United States Army officer who had served nine years in the military, including one in the Iraq War as a sergeant in a counter-intelligence unit. 
Receiving 67.9% of the vote in the general election, Rothman was able to win re-election fairly easily. 
District 10.
This district lies in the north-east part of the state, including all or portions of Essex, Hudson and Union counties. It has been represented by Democrat Donald M. Payne since 1989. Payne ran unopposed in 2006. In 2008, the Republicans again failed to nominate a candidate to oppose Payne, but the Socialist Workers Party nominated Michael Taber, an editor. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
Payne was re-elected in a landslide, garnering 99% of the vote.
District 11.
This district lies in the north-central part of the state, including all or portions of Essex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Sussex counties. It has been represented by Republican Rodney Frelinghuysen since 1995. The Democratic nominee is Tom Wyka (campaign website) of Parsippany-Troy Hills, a certified project manager in the information technology industry who was also the nominee in 2006. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
The turnout for this election was much higher than the 2006 contest, but the result was more or less the same: Frelinghuysen defeated Wyka with roughly 62% of the vote.
District 12.
This district lies in the central part of the state, including all or portions of Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth and Somerset counties. It has been represented by Democrat Rush D. Holt Jr. since 1999. The Republican nominee was Alan Bateman, the deputy mayor of Holmdel Township. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
62.5% of the vote went to Holt, giving him a sixth term in Congress.
District 13.
This district lies in the north-east part of the state, including all or portions of Essex, Hudson, Middlesex and Union counties. It has been represented by Democrat Albio Sires since November 2006. Sires' Republican challenger was Joseph Turula, a partner in the Jersey City law firm of Turula & Garcia, who served six years on the borough council of Pompton Lakes before moving to Jersey City. Louis Vernotico, a three-time failed candidate for New Jersey Senate, made his first bid for federal office under the slogan "Eliminate the Primary."
CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
In the general election, the heavily Democratic 13th District elected Sires to his second full term. He received 75.3% of the vote, compared to 21.9% for Turula and 2.8% for Vernotico.

Beautiful Mess (song)

"Beautiful Mess" is a song written by Shane Minor, Clay Mills and former Exile member Sonny LeMaire, and recorded by American country music group Diamond Rio. It was released in April 2002 as the first single from Diamond Rio's album "Completely". The song reached Number One on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, a position that it held for two non-consecutive weeks. The song was also Diamond Rio's most successful crossover single, peaking at number 28 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.
Content.
The song is a mid-tempo in which the narrator describes how his life has changed since he fell in love. He describes himself as "going out of mind" and unable to concentrate — for example, appearing tired at work, accidentally putting salt in his coffee, and "walkin' 'round in a haze". Ultimately, he calls his state of mind a "beautiful mess".
Critical reception.
Chuck Taylor, of "Billboard" magazine reviewed the song favorably saying that "reverb-drenched guitar, a smoldering melody, and the barely contained pathos in the vocal highlight this next slice of excellence." Taylor said the "well-rendered backup vocals" and the good production give depth to the song.
Music video.
The music video was directed by Deaton Flanigen and premiered on CMT on May 31, 2002. It was filmed at The Nashville International Airport.
Charts.
"Beautiful Mess" debuted at number 55 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for the week of April 13, 2002. "Beautiful Mess" reached its peak of number one on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart on the chart week of September 28, 2002. One week later, it fell to the number-two position. "Beautiful Mess" then returned to the number one spot on the chart dated for October 12, accounting for a second and final week in that peak.
