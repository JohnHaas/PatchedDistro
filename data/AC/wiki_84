Wielopole Skrzyńskie

Wielopole Skrzyńskie is a village (town in 1348 - 1933) in Ropczyce-Sędziszów County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Wielopole Skrzyńskie. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately south of Ropczyce and west of the regional capital Rzeszów. Tadeusz Kantor, a Polish painter, assemblage artist, set designer and theatre director, was born in Wielopole. Another famous personality born here is Marcin Daniec, popular stand-up comedian.
On 11 May 1955, in a wooden barracks fire during cinema projection, 58 people (including 36 children) perished, the worst one-day death toll in Polish post-war history This tragedy was commemorated by a monument, which stands in Wielopole’s market square.
The history of Wielopole dates back to the 12th century, when it was a defensive gord, located on a hill called "Stroszowa Góra", among the forests near the border between Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia. It was first mentioned in 1124, in a document of papal legate Gilles de Paris. In 1266 Ruthenian Prince Swarno, supported by Lithuanians and Tatars, raided eastern Lesser Poland, burning Wielopole to the ground. The village received Magdeburg rights in c. 1348, and at that time it was called "Fuerstenberg", due to the fact that most of its inhabitants were the Walddeutsche. The town was located on a merchant route from Sandomierz, through Ropczyce, towards the Kingdom of Hungary, and until late 14th century, it was property of the Bishopric of Lebus.
In 1325, Wielopole already had a parich church of St. Mary. The town remained in private hands; after the Bishopric of Lebus, its owners were the Kamieniecki family, the Frysztacki family (1492 - 1518), and the Maciejowski family. In the late 15th century, 111 families resided in Wielopole, with a few artisans. In the first half of the 16th century, town’s owner Kacper Maciejowski began to invest in Wielopole, building a Renaissance castle. The town however did not emerge as an important trade center. It belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship, and its situation deteriorated after the Swedish invasion of Poland, when both Swedish and Transilvanian armies of George II Rakoczi burned and ransacked it. In the 18th century, Wielopole declined further, and following the Partitions of Poland, it found itself in Austrian Galicia.
By the early 19th century, half of Wielopole’s residents were Jewish. In 1806, an epidemic of cholera killed 92, and in 1833, Wielopole burned in a fire. During the Galician slaughter, a gang of peasants entered the castle, murdering several noblemen gathered there. In the mid-19th century, Wielopole belonged to Borgiasz de Zaręba Skrzyński, after whom the adjective "Skrzyńskie" was added to the name. It remained a small, provincial town, without rail transport, as Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis goes some 15 kilometers to the north.
On September 24, 1914, Wielopole was captured by the Russian Imperial Army. The Russians retreated after two weeks, to return in October 1915. In May 1915, during the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive, Wielopole was seized by the Austrians. World War I resulted in widespread destruction and poverty of local population. Wielopole did not recover in the Second Polish Republic, and in 1933, its town charter was taken away. Since then, it has been a village. Its Jewish population was murdered by Germans in the Holocaust, and in August 1944, the village was partially destroyed. Among points of interest there are: Baroque parish church (1683), with a bell tower, early 19th century roadside chapel in the market square, 19th century wooden houses, ruins of defensive wall, and cemeteries.

Waśniów

Waśniów is a village in Ostrowiec County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Waśniów. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately west of Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski and east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 460.
Waśniów is one of the oldest villages in the area. It had the status of a town from 1351 to 1869, and its name (also spelled as Waśniów) comes from a Slavic language word "wasn", which means an argument. The village was first mentioned in the year 1145, as Vasnov, later Wasnowe, and Wasnow. Following the order of Duke Mieszko III the Old, Waśniów, together with its market place, was granted to the Archbishops of Gniezno. Soon afterwards, in 1147, the village passed into the hands of Canons Regular from Trzemeszno.
On January 7, 1351, King Kazimierz Wielki granted Sroda Slaska town charter to Waśniów. In the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Waśniów belonged to the Sandomierz Voivodeship. The town was located along ancient merchant routes from Sandomierz and Opatow towards central Poland. In 1409, during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War, it was visited by King Wladyslaw Jagiello, and in 1432, Waśniów passed into the hands of the Wachock Abbey. Despite additional privileges, granted to it by King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk in 1467, Waśniów remained a small town, which furthermore burned in 80%, in a great fire in 1523. The fire put an end to its development, and further destruction was brought by the Swedish invasion of Poland (1656), as well as the Great Northern War (1705).
After the Partitions of Poland, Waśniów briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 - 1915, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1827, the town had the population of 295, with 42 houses. During the January Uprising, Marian Langiewicz stayed in the area of WasnWaśniówiow. Several skirmishes took place here between Russian soldiers and Polish rebels, and as a punishment, Waśniów was stripped of town charter in 1869. In the late 19th century, the village was located in Opatow County, and had the population of 386. By the 1920s, already in Second Polish Republic’s Kielce Voivodeship, Waśniów had the population of 580. It did not have a train station, the nearest one was and still is located 14 kilometers away, at Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski (known then as Ostrowiec nad Kamienna).
Among points of interest at Waśniów is the Holy Trinity parish church, whose existence was first mentioned in 1145. In 1656, the wooden church was replaced by a brick, late Renaissance complex, with a Baroque interior. In 1882 the church was expanded, and in 1971-1975 it was restored.
In 1633, in a folwark called Gaj, located near Wasniow, a prominent Polish language poet Wespazjan Kochowski was born. He dedicated one of his poems to Wasniow.

New Zealanders Jane and Rebecca Perrott swam for Fiji at the games, as their father was Registrar at the University of the South Pacific. At 12½ Rebecca was the youngest competitor at the games.
Television.
The Games were the first major event to be televised after the introduction of colour television to New Zealand in November 1973. However, due to the NZBC's limited colour facilities, only athletics, swimming, and boxing were broadcast in colour. The National Film Unit produced Games '74, a feature length documentary in colour of the games. This has since been restored and is available on DVD.

List of people associated with the Revolt of the Comuneros

This is a list of participants and notable figures of the Revolt of the Comuneros, a rebellion from 1520 to 1522 in Castile.
Royalists.
The Royalist side fought to uphold the existing government of King Charles I ("Carlos I"). Along with Charles, the government was led by the Regent, Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht ("Adriano de Utrecht"). Charles' departure for Germany to take up his recently acquired position as Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire (There were four Charles before him as Holy Roman Emperor, but none as King of Castile and Aragon) helped provoke the Revolt; he was seen as having broken his promise to leave a Castilian in charge of the country, for Adrian was Flemish.
Despite being in Germany for the duration of the Revolt, Charles nevertheless played an important role in quelling it via communication and orders to Regent Adrian. One of the most influential decisions Charles made was to appoint two new co-regents to govern Castile: the Constable of Castile, Íñigo Fernández, and the Admiral of Castile, Fadrique Enríquez.
Royal Council and Advisers.
The Royal Council had functionally run the country during the period following King Philip I. However, they were not well regarded among the common people; the government often ineffectively stood by while nobles illegally expanded their domain through threats of force. Corruption ran rampant, and the government fell into debt. The Council's President, Antonio de Rojas, was widely hated.
Still, disrespect of the Royal Council paled next to the distaste of the retinue of Flemish advisers that Charles brought with him into Spain. William de Croÿ, sieur de Chièvres ("Guillermo de Croÿ, señor de Chièvres") had managed much of Charles' upbringing in Flanders and had not taught him overly much statecraft; by doing so he forced Charles to rely on him for advice. Many of these Flemish advisers proceeded to enrich themselves with funds from the Castilian treasury. William de Croÿ became Treasurer of Castile, a position which he later sold to Alvaro de Zúñiga, duke of Béjar, for 30,000 ducats. William had full control over who was appointed to administrative positions to Spain's fledgling colonies in the West Indies, and appointed friends of his to positions such as Bishop of Cuba. He promised rich fiefs to Laurent de Gorrevot (another prominent Flemish adviser) in Cuba and the Yucutan (later annulled), permitted the importation of 4,000 African slaves to the Indies, and sold rights to a syndicate for 25,000 ducats. William also managed to get his twenty-year-old nephew (named William de Croÿ as well) appointed Archbishop of Toledo, an extremely unpopular act of nepotism. Jean Le Sauvage served as chancellor and controversially presided over the Cortes of Valladolid in 1518. Le Sauvage obtained in December 1517 the right to collect duties on the export of almonds and dried fruits, a position formerly held by the ruler of Granada. Le Sauvage leased this privilege to Fernando de Córdoba for nine years for 168,000 ducats.
Comuneros.
The comuneros were the rebels who tried to overthrow the Royal Council and set up their own government. Their firmest base of support was the middle and upper-middle classes. The monied elite had been treated well under the regime of Ferdinand and Isabella, but had seen their standing decay under the Royal Council to the most powerful nobles. Some nobles (especially "low" nobles) threw their lot in as well, jealous of the foreigners who occupied many of the prestigious positions of government under Charles. The rural peasants generally had conflicted loyalties.
In the second phase of the rebellion, the revolt took a strongly antiseigneurial turn under Bishop Antonio de Acuña and others. This helped make the peasants friendlier to the comuneros' cause at the cost of repelling many powerful nobles worried about their privileges.

The 1936 United States presidential election in California refers to how California participated in the 1936 United States presidential election. California voted for the Democratic incumbent, Franklin Roosevelt, in a landslide over the Republican challenger, Kansas Governor Alfred Landon, carrying every county. As of 2012, this is the last time that a presidential candidate from either political party completely swept all of California's counties in an election. Roosevelt is the last Democrat to carry Orange County in a presidential election, and was the last until John Kerry in 2004 to carry Alpine County. Also, this was the only one of Roosevelt's four presidential campaigns where he carried Riverside County.

<doc id="19039241" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19039241" title="Wasta">
Wasta

Wasta or Wasata (Arabic: واسْطة) is an Arabic word that loosely translates into Nepotism or " or 'who you know'. It refers to using one’s connections and/or influence to get things done, including government transactions such as the quick renewal of a passport, waiving of traffic fines, and getting hired for or promoted in a job. 
In other words, it amounts to getting something through favoritism rather than merit, or what is informally spoken of in English as "pull" from connections (the opposite of "push"). The English word cronyism overlaps in meaning but is not precisely the same. Roughly equivalent words in other languages include Sociolismo in Cuba; Blat in Russia; Guanxi in Chinese and "Vetternwirtschaft" in German, "protektzia" in Israeli slang; in Brazilian-Portuguese it is called "Pistolão", or in the slang "peixada".
Etymology.
Wasta is derived from the Modern Standard Arabic word "wasaṭ"( وسط) which commonly means medium but also often means something akin to intermediary, intercessor or middle-man. 
A Bahraini diarist provides some information about how the practice originated: 
Furthermore, companies in the Arab world rarely have a ‘no-nepotism’ policy in place, so one can often find a workforce with friends and friends relatives who may or may not be qualified. This takes place in both the public and private sectors.
In many Arab countries, such as United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan and Lebanon, wasta affects hiring and promotion decisions. This is not restricted to Arab nationals but is also practised by expatriates who use their connections as wastas.
With respect to recruitment, there seems to be a movement away from this wasta, especially in the case of multinationals and professional firms. However, Wasta is still widely used in the region.

Dutch Revolt

The Dutch Revolt (1566 or 1568–1648) was the successful revolt of the northern, largely Protestant Seven Provinces of the Low Countries against the rule of the Roman Catholic King Philip II of Spain, who had inherited the region (Seventeen Provinces) from the defunct Duchy of Burgundy. (The southern Catholic provinces initially joined in the revolt, but later submitted to Spain.)
The religious 'clash of cultures' built up gradually but inexorably into outbursts of violence against the perceived repression of the Habsburg Crown. These tensions led to the formation of the independent Dutch Republic. The first leader was William of Orange, followed by several of his descendants and relations. This revolt was one of the first successful secessions in Europe, and led to one of the first European republics of the modern era, the "United Provinces".
King Philip was initially successful in suppressing the rebellion. In 1572, however, the rebels captured Brielle and the rebellion resurged. The northern provinces became independent, first in 1581 "de facto", and in 1648 "de jure". During the revolt, the United Provinces of the Netherlands, better known as the Dutch Republic, rapidly grew to become a world power through its merchant shipping and experienced a period of economic, scientific, and cultural growth. The Southern Netherlands (situated in modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg, northern France and southern Netherlands) remained under Spanish rule. The continuous heavy-handed rule by the Habsburgs in the south caused many of its financial, intellectual, and cultural elite to flee north, contributing to the success of the Dutch Republic. The Dutch imposed a rigid blockade on the southern provinces which prevented Baltic grain relieving famine in the southern towns, especially from 1587 to 1589. By the end of the war in 1648 large areas of the Southern Netherlands had been lost to France which had, under the guidance of Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIII of France, allied itself with the Dutch Republic in the 1630s against Spain. 
The first phase of the conflict can be considered to be the Dutch War of Independence. The focus of the latter phase was to gain official recognition of the already "de facto" independence of the United Provinces. This phase coincided with the rise of the Dutch Republic as a major power and the founding of the Dutch Empire.
Background.
In a series of marriages and conquests, a succession of Dukes of Burgundy expanded their original territory by adding to it a series of fiefdoms, including the Seventeen Provinces. Although Burgundy itself had been lost to France in 1477, the Burgundian Netherlands were still intact when Charles V was born in Ghent in 1500. He was raised in the Netherlands and spoke fluent Dutch, French, Spanish, and some German. In 1506 he became lord of the Burgundian states, among which were the Netherlands. Subsequently, in 1516, he inherited several titles, including the combined kingdoms of Aragon, and Castile and León which had become a worldwide empire with the Spanish colonization of the Americas. In 1519 he became ruler of the Habsburg empire, and he gained the title Holy Roman Emperor in 1530. Although Friesland and Guelders offered prolonged resistance (under "Grutte Pier" and Charles of Egmond, respectively), virtually all of the Netherlands had been incorporated into the Habsburg domains by the early 1540s.
Taxation.
Flanders had long been a very wealthy region, and had been coveted by the French kings for a long time. The other Netherlands had also grown into wealthy and entrepreneurial regions within the empire. Charles V's empire became a worldwide empire with large American and European territories. The latter were, however, distributed throughout Europe. Control and defence of these were hampered by the disparateness of the territories and huge length of the empire's borders. This large realm was almost continuously at war with its neighbours in its European heartlands, most notably against France in the Italian Wars and against the Turks in the Mediterranean Sea. Further wars were fought against Protestant princes in Germany. The Netherlands paid heavy taxes to fund these wars, but perceived them as unnecessary and sometimes downright harmful, because they were directed against their most important trading partners.
Protestantism.
During the 16th century, Protestantism rapidly gained ground in northern Europe. Dutch Protestants, after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities. By the 1560s, the Protestant community had become a significant influence in the Netherlands, although it clearly formed a minority then. In a society dependent on trade, freedom and tolerance were considered essential. Nevertheless, Charles V, and later Philip II, felt it was their duty to defeat Protestantism, which was considered a heresy by the Catholic Church and a threat to the stability of the whole hierarchical political system. On the other hand, the intensely moralistic Dutch Protestants insisted their Biblical theology, sincere piety and humble lifestyle was morally superior to the luxurious habits and superficial religiosity of the ecclesiastical nobility. The harsh measures led to increasing grievances in the Netherlands, where the local governments had embarked on a course of peaceful coexistence. In the second half of the century, the situation escalated. Philip sent troops to crush the rebellion and make the Netherlands once more a Catholic region.
Centralisation.
Part of the shifting balance of power in the late Middle Ages meant that besides the local nobility, many of the Dutch administrators by now were not traditional aristocrats, but instead stemmed from non-noble families that had risen in status over the last centuries. By the 15th century, Brussels had thus become the "de facto" capital of the Seventeen Provinces. Dating back to the Middle Ages the districts of the Netherlands, represented by its nobility and the wealthy city-dwelling merchants still had a large measure of autonomy in appointing its administrators. Charles V and Philip II set out to improve the management of the empire by increasing the authority of the central government in matters like law and taxes, a policy which caused suspicion both among the nobility and the merchant class. An example of this is the takeover of power in the city of Utrecht in 1528 when Charles V supplanted the council of guild masters governing the city by his own stadtholder, who took over worldly powers in the whole province of Utrecht from the archbishop of Utrecht. Charles ordered the construction of the heavily fortified castle of Vredenburg, for defence against the Duchy of Gelre and to control the citizens of Utrecht.
Under the governorship of Mary of Hungary (1531–1555), traditional power had for a large part been taken away both from the stadtholders of the provinces and from the high noblemen, who had been replaced by professional jurists in the Council of State.
Initial stages (1555–1572).
Prelude to the rebellion (1555–1568).
In 1556 Charles passed on his throne to his son Philip II of Spain. Charles, despite his harsh actions, had been seen as a ruler empathetic to the needs of the Netherlands. Philip, on the other hand, was raised in Spain and spoke neither Dutch nor French. During Philip's reign, tensions flared in the Netherlands over heavy taxation, suppression of Protestantism, and centralisation efforts. The growing conflict would reach a boiling point and would lead ultimately to the war of independence.
Nobility in opposition.
In an effort to build a stable and trustworthy government of the Netherlands, Philip appointed his half-sister Margaret of Parma as governor of the Netherlands. He continued the policy of his father of appointing members of the high nobility of the Netherlands to the "Raad van State" (Council of State), the governing body of the seventeen Netherlands, that advised her. He made his confidant Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle head of that Council. However, already in 1558 the States of the provinces and the States-General of the Netherlands started to contradict Philip's wishes, by objecting to his tax proposals and by demanding, with eventual success, the withdrawal of Spanish troops which had been left by Philip to guard the Southern Netherlands' borders with France, but which they saw as a threat to their own independence (1559–1561). Subsequent reforms met with much opposition, which was mainly directed at Granvelle. Petitions to King Philip by the high nobility went unanswered. Some of the most influential nobles, including Lamoral, Count of Egmont, Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn, and William the Silent, withdrew from the Council of State until Philip recalled Granvelle. 
In late 1564, the nobles had noticed the growing power of the reformation and urged Philip to come up with realistic measures to prevent violence. Philip answered that sterner measures were the only answer. Subsequently Egmont, Horne and Orange withdrew once more from the Council, and Bergen and Meghem resigned their Stadholdership. During the same period, the religious protests were increasing in spite of increased oppression. In 1566, a league of about 400 members of the nobility presented a petition to the governor Margaret of Parma, to suspend persecution until the rest had returned. One of Margaret's courtiers, Count Berlaymont, called the presentation of this petition an act of "beggars" (French "gueux"), a name then taken up by the petitioners themselves (i.e. "Geuzen"). The petition was sent on to Philip for a final verdict.
1566 — Iconoclasm and repression.
The atmosphere in the Netherlands was tense due to the rebellion, preaching of Calvinist leaders, hunger after the bad harvest of 1565, and economic difficulties due to the Northern Seven Years' War. Early August 1566, a monastery church at Steenvoorde in Flanders (now in Northern France) was sacked by a mob led by the preacher Sebastian Matte. This incident was followed by similar riots elsewhere in Flanders, and before long the Netherlands had become the scene of the Beeldenstorm, a riotous iconoclastic movement by Calvinists, who stormed churches and other religious buildings to desecrate and destroy church art and all kinds of decorative fittings over most of the country. The number of actual image-breakers appears to have been relatively small and the exact backgrounds of the movement are debated, but in general, local authorities did not step in to rein in the vandalism. The actions of the iconoclasts drove the nobility into two camps, with Orange and other grandees opposing the movement and others, notably Henry of Brederode, supporting it. Even before he answered the petition by the nobles, Philip had lost control in the troublesome Netherlands. He saw no other option than to send an army to suppress the rebellion. On 22 August 1567, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, marched into Brussels at the head of 10,000 troops.
Alba took harsh measures and rapidly established a special court ("Raad van Beroerten" or Council of Troubles) to judge anyone who opposed the King. Alba considered himself the direct representative of Philip in the Netherlands and frequently bypassed Margaret of Parma and made use of her to lure back some of the fugitive nobles, notably the counts of Egmont and Horne, causing her to resign office in September 1567. Egmont and Horne were arrested for high treason, condemned, and a year later decapitated on the Grand Place in Brussels. Egmont and Horne had been Catholic nobles, loyal to the King of Spain until their deaths. The reason for their execution was that Alba considered they had been treasonous to the king in their tolerance to Protestantism. Their executions, ordered by a Spanish noble, provoked outrage. More than one thousand people were executed in the following months. The large number of executions led the court to be nicknamed the "Blood Court" in the Netherlands, and Alba to be called the "Iron Duke". Rather than pacifying the Netherlands, these measures helped to fuel the unrest.
William of Orange.
William I of Orange was stadtholder of the provinces Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht, and Burgrave of Antwerp; and the most influential noble in the States General who had signed the petition. After the arrival of Alba, to avoid arrest, as had happened to Egmont and Horne, he fled to the lands ruled by his wife's father — the Count-Elector of Saxony. All his lands and titles in the Netherlands were forfeited to the Spanish King.
In 1568, William returned to try to drive the highly unpopular Duke of Alba from Brussels. William's nominal purpose was to remove misguided ministers like Alba, end rebellion, and thus restore the proper authority of King Phillip. This view is reflected in today's Dutch national anthem, the Wilhelmus, in which the last lines of the first stanza read: "den koning van Hispanje heb ik altijd geëerd" ("I have always honoured the King of Spain"). In pamphlets and in his letters to allies in the Netherlands William also called attention to the right of subjects to renounce their oaths of obedience if the sovereign would not respect their privileges. William's forces moved into the Netherlands from four different directions. Armies led by his brothers invaded from Germany while French Huguenots invaded from the south. Although the Battle of Rheindalen near Roermond had occurred on 23 April 1568 and had been won by the Spanish, the Battle of Heiligerlee, fought on 23 May 1568, is commonly regarded as the beginning of the Eighty Years' War, and it was a victory for the rebel army. But the campaign ended in failure as William ran out of money and his own army disintegrated, while those of his allies were destroyed by the Duke of Alba. William remained at large and, as the only grandee still able to offer resistance, was from then on seen as the leader of the rebellion. 
When the revolt broke out once more in 1572 he moved his court back to the Netherlands, to Delft in Holland, as the ancestral lands of Orange in Breda remained occupied by the Spanish. Delft remained William's base of operations until his assassination by Balthasar Gérard in 1584. 
Resurgence (1572–1585).
Spain was hampered by the fact that it was waging war on multiple fronts simultaneously. Its struggle against the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean Sea put serious limits on the military power it could deploy against the rebels in the Netherlands. France too was opposing Spain at every juncture. Furthermore, England, particularly English privateers, were harassing Spanish shipping and its colonies in the Atlantic. 
Already in 1566 William I of Orange had asked for Ottoman support. As Suleiman the Magnificent claimed that he felt religiously close to the Protestants, ("since they did not worship idols, believed in one God and fought against the Pope and Emperor") he supported the Dutch together with the French and the English, as well as generally support Protestants and Calvinists, as a way to counter Habsburg attempts at supremacy in Europe.
Even so, by 1570 the Spanish had more or less suppressed the rebellion throughout the Netherlands. However, in March 1569, in an effort to finance his troops, Alba had proposed to the States that new taxes be introduced, among them the "Tenth Penny", a 1/10 levy on all sales other than landed property. 
This proposal was rejected by the States, and a compromise was subsequently agreed upon. Then, in 1571, Alba decided to press forward with the collection of the Tenth Penny regardless of the States' opposition. This aroused strong protest from both Catholics and Protestants, and support for the rebels grew once more and was fanned by a large group of refugees who had fled the country during Alva's rule. 
On 1 March 1572, the English Queen Elizabeth I ousted the Gueux, known as Sea Beggars, from the English harbours in an attempt to appease the Spanish King. The Gueux under their leader Lumey then unexpectedly captured the almost undefended town of Brill on 1 April. In securing Brill, the rebels had gained a foothold, and more importantly a token victory in the north. This was a sign for Protestants all over the Low Countries to rebel once more.
Most of the important cities in the provinces of Holland and Zealand declared loyalty to the rebels. Notable exceptions were Amsterdam and Middelburg, which remained loyal to the Catholic cause until 1578. William of Orange was put at the head of the revolt. He was recognised as Governor-General and Stadholder of Holland, Zeeland, Friesland and Utrecht at a meeting in Dordrecht in July 1572. It was agreed that power would be shared between Orange and the States. With the influence of the rebels rapidly growing in the northern provinces, the war entered a second and more decisive phase.
However, this also led to an increased discord amongst the Dutch. On one side there was a militant Calvinist minority that wanted to continue fighting the Catholic Philip II and convert all Dutch citizens to Calvinism. On the other end was a mostly Catholic minority that wanted to remain loyal to the governor and his administration in Brussels. In between was the large majority of (Catholic) Dutch that had no particular allegiance, but mostly wanted to restore Dutch privileges and the expulsion of the Spanish mercenary armies. William of Orange was the central figure who had to rally these groups to a common goal. In the end he was forced to move more and more towards the radical Calvinist side fighting the Spanish. He went over to Calvinism himself in 1573.
Pacification of Ghent.
Being unable to deal with the rebellion, Alba was replaced in 1573 by Luis de Requesens and a new policy of moderation was attempted. Spain, however, had to declare bankruptcy in 1575. 
Don Luis de Requesens had not managed to broker a policy acceptable to both the Spanish King and the Netherlands when he died in early 1576. 
The inability to pay the Spanish mercenary armies endured, leading to numerous mutinies and in November 1576 troops sacked Antwerp at the cost of some 8,000 lives. This so-called "Spanish Fury" strengthened the resolve of the rebels in the 17 provinces to take fate into their own hands.
The Netherlands negotiated an internal treaty, the Pacification of Ghent in the same year 1576, in which the provinces agreed to religious tolerance and pledged to fight together against the mutinous Spanish forces. 
For the mostly Catholic provinces, the destruction by mutinous foreign troops was the principal reason to join in an open revolt, but formally the provinces still remained loyal to the sovereign Philip II. 
However, some religious hostilities continued and Spain, aided by shipments of Bullion from the New World, was able to send a new army under Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza.
Unions of Arras and Utrecht.
On 6 January 1579, prompted by the new Spanish governor Alexander Farnese, the later Duke of Parma, and upset by aggressive Calvinism, some of the Southern States (County of Artois, County of Hainaut and the so-called Walloon Flanders located in what is now France and Wallonia) left the alliance agreed upon by the pacification of Ghent and signed the Union of Arras (Atrecht), expressing their loyalty to the Spanish king. This meant an early end to the goal of united independence for the 17 provinces of the Low Countries on the basis of religious tolerance, agreed upon only three years previously.
In response to the union of Arras, William united the provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders and Groningen in the Union of Utrecht on 23 January 1579; Brabant and Flanders joined a month later, in February 1579. Effectively, the 17 provinces were now divided into a southern group loyal to the Spanish king, and a rebellious northern group.
Act of Abjuration.
In 16th century Europe, it was assumed that every country would have a king or other noble as head of state. Having repudiated Philip, States General tried to find a suitable replacement. The Protestant Queen of England, Elizabeth I, seemed the obvious choice to be protector of the Netherlands. Elizabeth, however, found the idea abhorrent. Her intervention for the French Huguenots (see the Treaty of Hampton Court) had been a costly mistake, and she had resolved never again to involve herself in any of her fellow monarchs’ domestic affairs. Not only would intervention provoke Philip, but it would set a dangerous precedent. If she could interfere in other monarchs' affairs, they could return the favour. (Elizabeth did later provide aid to the Dutch rebels in the Treaty of Nonsuch (1585), and as a consequence Philip aided Irish rebels in the Nine Years' War.)
The States-General then (in 1581) invited François, Duke of Anjou (younger brother of King Henry III of France), to be sovereign ruler. Anjou accepted on the condition that the Netherlands officially denounce any loyalty to Philip. In 1581, the States-General issued the Act of Abjuration, which declared that the King of Spain had not upheld his responsibilities to the people of the Netherlands and therefore would no longer be accepted as the rightful sovereign. Anjou arrived in February 1582. Though welcomed in some cities, he was rejected by Holland and Zeeland. Most of the people distrusted him as a Catholic, and the States-General granted him very limited powers. He brought a small French army to the Netherlands, and then decided to seize control of Antwerp by force in January 1583. This attempt failed disastrously, and Anjou left the Netherlands.
Elizabeth was now offered the sovereignty of the Netherlands, but she declined. All options for foreign royalty being exhausted, the States-General eventually decided to rule as a republican body instead.
The Fall of Antwerp.
Immediately after the Act of Abjuration, Spain sent a new army to recapture the United Provinces. Over the following years, Parma reconquered the major part of Flanders and Brabant, as well as large parts of the northeastern provinces. The Roman Catholic religion was restored in much of this area. In 1585, Antwerp — the largest city in the Low Countries at the time — fell into his hands, which caused over half its population to flee to the north (see also Siege of Antwerp). Between 1560 and 1590, the population of Antwerp plummeted from c. 100,000 inhabitants to c. 42,000.
William of Orange, who had been declared an outlaw by Philip II in March 1580, was assassinated by a supporter of the King on 10 July 1584. He would be succeeded as leader of the rebellion by his son Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange.
The Netherlands were split into an independent northern part and a southern part which remained under Spanish control. Due to the almost uninterrupted rule of the Calvinist-dominated separatists, most of the population of the northern provinces became converted to Protestantism over the next decades. The south, under Spanish rule, remained a Catholic stronghold; most of its Protestants fled to the north. Spain retained a large military presence in the south, where it could also be used against France.
"De facto" independence of the north (1585–1609).
With the war going against them, the United Provinces had sought help from the kingdoms of France and England and, in February to May 1585, even offered each monarch sovereignty over the Netherlands, but both had declined.
While England had unofficially been supporting the Dutch for years, Elizabeth had not officially supported the Dutch because she was afraid it might aggravate Spain into a war. However, the year before, the Catholics of France had signed a treaty with Spain to destroy the French Protestants. Afraid that France would fall under control of the Habsburgs, Elizabeth now decided to act. In 1585, under the Treaty of Nonsuch, Elizabeth I sent the Earl of Leicester to take the rule as lord-regent, with 5,000 to 6,000 troops, including 1,000 cavalry. The Earl of Leicester proved to be a poor commander, and also did not understand the sensitive trade arrangements between the Dutch regents and the Spanish. Moreover, Leicester sided with the radical Calvinists, earning him the distrust of the Catholics and moderates. Leicester also collided with many Dutch patricians when he tried to strengthen his own power at the cost of the Provincial States. Within a year of his arrival, he had lost his public support. Leicester returned to England, after which the States-General, being unable to find any other suitable regent, appointed Maurice of Orange (William's son), at the age of 20, to the position of Captain General of the Dutch army in 1587. On 7 September 1589 Philip II ordered Parma to move all available forces south to prevent Henry of Navarre from becoming King of France. For Spain the Netherlands had become a side show in comparison to the French Wars of Religion.
The borders of the present-day Netherlands were largely defined by the campaigns of Maurice of Orange. The Dutch successes owed not only to his tactical skill but also to the financial burden Spain incurred replacing ships lost in the disastrous campaign of the Spanish Armada in 1588, and the need to refit its navy to recover control of the sea after the subsequent English counterattack. One of the most notable features of this war are the number of mutinies by the troops in the Spanish army because of arrears of pay. At least 40 mutinies in the period 1570 to 1607 are known. In 1595, when Henry IV of France declared war against Spain, the Spanish government declared bankruptcy again. However, by regaining control of the sea, Spain was able to greatly increase its supply of gold and silver from the Americas, which allowed it to increase military pressure on England and France.
Under financial and military pressure, in 1598, Philip ceded the Netherlands to his favourite daughter Isabella and to her husband, Philip's nephew Archduke Albert of Austria (they proved to be highly competent governors) following the conclusion of the Treaty of Vervins with France. By that time Maurice was engaged in conquering important cities in the Netherlands. Starting with the important fortification of Bergen op Zoom (1588), Maurice conquered Breda (1590), Zutphen, Deventer, Delfzijl and Nijmegen (1591), Steenwijk, Coevorden (1592) Geertruidenberg (1593) Groningen (1594) Grol, Enschede, Ootmarsum, Oldenzaal (1597) and Grave (1602). As this campaign was restricted to the border areas of the current Netherlands, the heartland of Holland remained at peace, during which time it moved into its Golden age.
By now, it had become clear that Spanish control of the Southern Netherlands was strong. However, control over Zeeland meant that the Northern Netherlands could control and close the estuary of the Scheldt, the entry to the sea for the important port of Antwerp. The port of Amsterdam benefited greatly from the blockade of the port of Antwerp, to the extent that merchants in the North began to question the desirability of reconquering the South. A campaign to control the Southern provinces' coast region was launched against Maurice's advice in 1600. Although portrayed as a liberation of the Southern Netherlands, the campaign was chiefly aimed at eliminating the threat to Dutch trade posed by the Spanish-supported Dunkirkers. The Spaniards strengthened their positions along the coast, leading to the Battle of Nieuwpoort.
Although the States-General army won great acclaim for itself and its commander by inflicting a then-surprising defeat of a Spanish army in open battle, Maurice halted the march on Dunkirk and returned to the Northern Provinces. Maurice never forgave the regents, led by van Oldenbarneveld, for being sent on this mission. By now the division of the Netherlands into separate states had become almost inevitable. With the failure to eliminate the Dunkirk threat to trade, the states decided to build up their navy to protect sea trade, which had greatly increased through the creation of the Dutch East Indies Company in 1602. The strengthened Dutch fleets would prove to be a formidable force, hampering Spain's naval ambitions thereafter.
Twelve Years' Truce (1609–1621).
1609 saw the start of a ceasefire, afterwards called the Twelve Years' Truce, between the United Provinces and the Spanish controlled southern states, mediated by France and England at The Hague. It was during this ceasefire the Dutch made great efforts to build their navy, which was later to have a crucial bearing on the course of the war.
During the Truce, two factions emerged in the Dutch camp, along political and religious lines. On one side were the Arminians, whose prominent supporters included Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius. They tended to be well-to-do merchants who accepted a less strict interpretation of the Bible than did classical Calvinists. They were opposed by the more radical Gomarists, who had openly proclaimed their allegiance to Prince Maurice in 1610. In 1617 the conflict escalated when republicans pushed the "Sharp Resolution", allowing the cities to take measures against the Gomarists. Prince Maurice accused van Oldenbarnevelt of treason, had him arrested, and in 1619, executed. Hugo Grotius fled the country after escaping from imprisonment in Castle Loevestein.
Final stages (1621–1648).
War recommences.
Negotiations for a permanent peace went on throughout the truce. Two major issues could not be resolved. First, the Spanish demand for religious freedom of Catholics in Northern Netherlands was countered by a Dutch demand for a similar religious freedom for Protestants in the Southern Netherlands. Second, there was a growing disagreement over the trade routes to the different colonies (in the Far East and the Americas) which could not be resolved. The Spanish made one last effort to reconquer the North, and the Dutch used their navy to enlarge their colonial trade routes to the detriment of Spain. The war was on once more — and crucially, merging with the wider Thirty Years' War.
In 1622, a Spanish attack on the important fortress town of Bergen op Zoom was repelled. However, in 1625 Maurice died while the Spanish laid siege to the city of Breda. Ignoring orders, the Spanish commander Ambrogio Spinola succeeded in conquering the city of Breda. The war was now more focused on trade, much of it in between the Dutch and the Dunkirkers, but also Dutch attacks on Spanish convoys but above all the seizure of the undermanned Portuguese trading forts and ill defended territories. Maurice's half-brother Frederick Henry had succeeded his brother and taken command of the army. Frederick Henry conquered the pivotal fortified city of 's-Hertogenbosch in 1629. This town, largest in the northern part of Brabant, had been considered to be impregnable from attack. Its loss was a serious blow to the Spanish.
In 1632, Frederick Henry captured Venlo, Roermond, and Maastricht during his famous "March along the Meuse" in a pincer move to prepare for the conquest of the major cities of Flanders. Attempts in the next years to attack Antwerp and Brussels failed, however. The Dutch were disappointed by the lack of support they received from the Flemish population. This was mainly because of the pillaging of Tienen and the new generation that had been raised in Flanders and Brabant, which had been thoroughly reconverted to Roman Catholicism and now distrusted the Calvinist Dutch even more than it loathed the Spanish occupants.
Colonial theatre.
As more European countries began to build their empires, the war between the countries extended to colonies as well. Battles for profitable colonies were fought as far away as Macau, East Indies, Ceylon, Formosa (Taiwan), the Philippines, Brazil, and others. The most important of these conflicts would become known as the Dutch-Portuguese War. The Dutch carved out a trading empire all over the world, using their dominance at sea to great advantage. The Dutch East India Company was founded to administer all Dutch trade with the East, while the Dutch West India Company did the same for the West.
In the Western colonies, the Dutch States General mostly restricted itself to supporting privateering by their captains in the Caribbean to drain the Spanish coffers and fill their own. The most successful of these raids was the capture of the larger part of the Spanish treasure fleet by Piet Hein in 1628, which allowed Frederick Henry to finance the siege of 's Hertogenbosch, and seriously troubled Spanish payments of troops. But attempts were also made to conquer existing colonies or found new ones in Brazil, North America and Africa. Most of these would be only briefly or partially successful. In the East the activities led to the conquest of many profitable trading colonies, a major factor in bringing about the Dutch Golden Age.
From war to peace.
In 1639, Spain sent an armada bound for Flanders, carrying 20,000 troops, to assist in a last large-scale attempt to defeat the northern "rebels". The armada was decisively defeated by Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp in the Battle of the Downs. This victory had historic consequences far beyond the Eighty Years' War as it marked the end of Spain as the dominant sea power.
An alliance with France changed the balance of power. The Republic could now hope to reconquer the Southern Netherlands. However, this would not mean that they would become a part of the Netherlands, but that they would be divided among the victors, resulting in a powerful French state bordering the Republic. Furthermore it would mean that the port of Antwerp would most likely no longer be blockaded and might become serious competition for Amsterdam. With the Thirty Years' War decided, there was also no longer any need to fight on to support fellow Protestant nations. As a result, the decision was made to end the war.
Peace.
On 30 January 1648, the war ended with the Treaty of Münster between Spain and the Netherlands. In Münster on 15 May 1648, the parties exchanged ratified copies of the treaty. This treaty was part of the European-scale Peace of Westphalia that also ended the Thirty Years' War. In the treaty, the power balance in Western Europe was readjusted to the actual geopolitical reality. This meant that "de jure" the Dutch Republic was recognised as an independent state and retained control over the territories that were conquered in the later stages of the war. The new republic consisted of seven provinces: Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel, Friesland, and Groningen. Each province was governed by its local Provincial States and by a stadtholder. In theory, each stadtholder was elected and subordinate to the States-General. However, the princes of Orange-Nassau, beginning with William I of Orange, became "de facto" hereditary stadtholders in Holland and Zeeland. In practice they usually became stadtholder of the other provinces as well. A constant power struggle, which already had shown its precursor during the Twelve years' Truce, emerged between the Orangists, who supported the stadtholders, and the Regent's supporters.
The border states, parts of Flanders, Brabant and Limburg that were conquered by the Dutch in the final stages of the war, were to be federally governed by the States-General. These were the so-called Generality Lands ("Generaliteitslanden"), which consisted of Staats-Brabant (present North Brabant), Staats-Vlaanderen (present Zeeuws-Vlaanderen) and Staats-Limburg (around Maastricht).
The peace would not be long-lived as the newly emerged world powers, the Republic of the Netherlands and the Commonwealth of England, would start their first war in 1652, only four years after the peace was signed.
Aftermath.
Nature of the war.
The Eighty Years' War began with a series of battles mostly fought by mercenaries, as was typical of the time. While successes for both parties were limited, costs were high and continued to grow as the war progressed. The structural inability of the Spanish government to pay its soldiers—it went bankrupt several times—led to perpetual large-scale mutinies among the Spanish army in the Netherlands, which continually frustrated Spain's military campaigns. On the Dutch side the States of Holland, with its opulent capital Amsterdam, bore the brunt of the costs of war and were able to do so successfully. The Spanish effort in the Netherlands was also hampered by the war against the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean during the 1570s, which demanded much of Spain's financial and human resources.
As the revolt and its suppression centred largely around issues of religious freedom and taxation, the conflict necessarily involved not only soldiers, but also civilians at all levels of society. This may be one reason for the resolve and subsequent successes of the Dutch rebels in defending cities. Another factor was the fact that the unpopularity of the Spanish army, which existed even before the start of the revolt, was exacerbated when in the early stage of the war a few cities were purposely sacked by the Spanish troops after having surrendered; this was done to intimidate the remaining rebel cities into surrender. Given the involvement of all sectors of Dutch society in the conflict, a more-or-less organised, irregular army emerged alongside the regular forces. Among these were the geuzen (from the French word "gueux" meaning "beggars"), who waged a guerrilla war against Spanish interests. Especially at sea, the 'watergeuzen' were effective agents of the Dutch cause.
Another aspect of warfare in the Netherlands was its relatively static character. There were very few pitched battles where armies met in the field. Most military operations were sieges, as was typical of the era, resulting in protracted and expensive use of the military forces available. The Dutch had fortified most of their cities and even many smaller towns in accordance with the most modern views of the time, and these cities had to be subdued one by one. Sometimes sieges were broken off when the enemy threatened to attack the besieging army, or, on the Spanish side, conquered cities were given up immediately, or occasionally sold back to the Dutch, when the conquering army turned mutinous.
In the later stages, Maurice raised a professional "standing" army that was even paid when no hostilities were taking place, a radical innovation in that time and part of the Military Revolution. This ensured him of loyal soldiers, who were trained in co-operating among each other and were intimately familiar with the doctrines of their commanders and were capable of carrying out complicated manoeuvres.
Effect on the Low Countries.
In the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, Charles V established the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands as an entity separate from France, Burgundy, or the Holy Roman Empire. The Netherlands at this point were among the wealthiest regions in Europe, and an important center of trade, finance, and art. The Eighty Years' War introduced a sharp breach in the region, with the Dutch Republic (the present-day Netherlands) growing into a world power (see Dutch Golden Age), and the Southern Netherlands (more or less present-day Belgium) losing much of its economic and cultural significance for centuries to come. The naval blockade during much of the Eighty Years' War of Antwerp, once the largest commercial centre of Europe, greatly contributed to the rise of Amsterdam as the new centre of European and world trade.
Politically, a unique situation had emerged in the Netherlands where a republican body (the States General) ruled, but where a (increasingly hereditary) noble function of Stadtholder was occupied by the house of Orange-Nassau. This division of power prevented large scale fighting between nobility and civilians as happened in the English Civil War. The frictions between the civil and noble fractions, that already started in the twelve years' truce, were numerous and would finally lead to an outburst with the French supported Batavian Republic, where Dutch bourgeoisie hoped to get rid of the increasing self-esteem in the nobility once and for all. However, in a dramatic resurgence of nobility after the Napoleonic era the republic would be abandoned in favour of the foundation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Thus, one of the oldest republics of Europe was turned into a monarchy, which it still is today.
Effect on the Spanish Empire.
The conquest of various American territories made Spain the leading European power of the 16th century. This brought them into continuous conflict with France and the emerging power that was England. In addition, the deeply religious monarchs Charles V and Philip II saw a role for themselves as protectors of the Catholic faith against Islam in the Mediterranean and against Protestantism in northern Europe. This meant the Spanish Empire was almost continuously at war. Of all these conflicts, the Eighty Years' War was the most prolonged and had a major effect on the Spanish finances and the morale of the Spanish people, who saw taxes increase and soldiers not returning, with little successes to balance the scales. The Spanish government had to declare several bankruptcies. The Spanish population increasingly questioned the necessity of the war in the Netherlands. The loss of Portugal in 1640 and the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, ending the war were the first signs that the role of the Spanish Empire in Europe was declining.
Political implications in Europe.
The Dutch revolt against their lawful sovereign, most obviously illustrated in the Act of abjuration (1581), implied that a sovereign could be deposed by the population if there was agreement that he did not fulfill his God given responsibility. This act by the Dutch challenged the concept of a divine right of kings, and eventually led to the Dutch Republic. The acceptance of a non-monarchic country by the other European powers in 1648 spread across Europe, fuelling resistance against the divine power of Kings.

AUDIX

AUDIX (AUDio Information EXchange) is a voicemail server intended to be used with a Lucent/Avaya private branch exchange (PBX). AUDIX features many integrations with Avaya PBXes, such as capturing the extension of the calling party and announcing that person's name (if they're also an AUDIX subscriber and have recorded their name on the system) when announcing the attributes of a message, automatic identification of subscribers when they are dialing in to retrieve their messages, and activating and deactivating message-waiting indicators.
It can also serve as a recording device. A subscriber with an appropriately administered feature button on their phone can press said button and within a few seconds, the station will be conferenced with AUDIX and AUDIX will record the conversation. The recording will be stored like a voice mail.
AUDIX systems are based on Unix, and share some software with Avaya's Conversant interactive voice response (IVR) platform. Early forms of unified messaging appeared in the late 1980s; earlier AUDIX releases interoperated with System V mail servers and with System 85 PBXes, when AT&T still owned UNIX. Many of the same status and control programs are used to operate AUDIX and Conversant systems, but an AUDIX system is geared specifically to serving up voicemail and is not a general IVR platform.

Seven Years' War

The Seven Years' War was a war that took place between 1754 and 1763 with the main conflict being in the seven-year period 1756–1763. It involved most of the great powers of the time and affected Europe, North America, Central America, the West African coast, India, and the Philippines. In the historiography of some countries, the war is alternatively named after combatants in the respective theatres: the French and Indian War as it is known in the United States or the War of the Conquest as it is known in French-speaking Canada, while it is called the Seven Years' War in English-speaking Canada (North America, 1754–63); Pomeranian War (with Sweden and Prussia, 1757–62); Third Carnatic War (on the Indian subcontinent, 1757–63); and Third Silesian War (with Prussia and Austria, 1756–63).
The war was driven by the antagonism between the great powers of Europe. Great Britain competed with both France and Spain over trade and colonies. Meanwhile rising power Prussia was struggling with Austria for dominance within and outside of the Holy Roman Empire. In the wake of the War of the Austrian Succession, the major powers "switched partners" with Prussia establishing an alliance with Britain while traditional enemies France and Austria formed an alliance of their own. The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller German states (especially Hanover) and later Portugal. The Austro-French alliance included Sweden, Saxony and later Spain. The Russian Empire was originally aligned with Austria, but switched sides upon the succession of Tsar Peter III in 1762 and, like Sweden, concluded a separate peace with Prussia.
The war ended with the Treaty of Paris between France, Spain and Great Britain and the Treaty of Hubertusburg between Saxony, Austria and Prussia in 1763. The war was characterized in Europe by sieges and arson of towns as well as open battles involving extremely heavy losses; overall, some 900,000 to 1,400,000 people died.
The war was a success for Great Britain, which gained the bulk of New France in eastern Canada, Spanish Florida, some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies, the colony of Senegal on the West African coast and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The native American tribes were excluded from the peace settlement, and were unable to return to their former status after the resulting Pontiac's War. In Europe the war began disastrously for Prussia but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and maintain the "status quo ante bellum" by the end of the war. The involvement of Portugal, Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. While France was deprived of many of its colonies and saddled with a heavy war debt, Spain lost Florida but gained French Louisiana and regained control of its colonies like Cuba and the Philippines that had been captured by the British during the war.
Nomenclature.
In Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, the name "Seven Years' War" is used to describe the North American conflict which began and originated much earlier in 1754 as well as the European and Asian conflicts which began in 1756, as the name Nine Years' War was already taken previously by historians to describe an earlier conflict. In the United States, however, the North American portion of the war is popularly known as the French and Indian War. Many scholars and professional historians in America, such as Fred Anderson, however, follow the example of their colleagues in other countries and refer to the conflict as The Seven Years' War, regardless of the theatre. In French Canada, the conflict is sometimes referred to as "La Guerre de la Conquête" (War of the Conquest).
The conflict in India is termed the Third Carnatic War while the fighting between Prussia and Austria is called the Third Silesian War. In Swedish historiography, the name "Pommerska kriget" (Pomeranian War) is used, as Swedish involvement was limited to Pomerania in northern central Germany.
The war was described as the first "world war", although this label was also given to various earlier conflicts such as the Eighty Years' War, the Thirty Years' War, the War of the Spanish Succession and the War of the Austrian Succession, and to later conflicts such as the Napoleonic Wars. The Anglo-French portion of the world-wide conflict, involving both empires, was one of the most significant phases of the Second Hundred Years' War, which is a name occasionally used by some historians to describe the continuous level of world-wide conflict over the entire 18th century, compared to the more famous and compact religious struggle of the 17th century.
Background.
This war is often said to be a continuation of the War of the Austrian Succession, which had lasted from 1740 to 1748, in which King Frederick II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, had seized the rich province of Silesia from Austria. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 in order to gain time to rebuild her military forces and to forge new alliances, which she did with remarkable success. The political map of Europe had been redrawn in a few years as Austria abandoned its twenty-five-year alliance with Britain. During the so‑called Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, the centuries-old enemies: France, Austria and Russia, formed a single alliance against Prussia.
Prussia's only major assistance came from Great Britain, her newfound ally, whose reigning dynasty saw its ancestral Hanoverian possessions in Germany being threatened by France. In many respects the two allied powers' forces complemented each other excellently. The British had the largest, most effective navy in the world, while Prussia had the most formidable land force in continental Europe. This allowed Britain to focus its military resources on colonial expeditions. The British had hoped that the new series of alliances formed during the Diplomatic Revolution would maintain the peace, but, in fact, they proved the catalyst for the eruption of hostilities in Europe in 1756.
The Austrian army had undergone an overhaul along the lines of the Prussian system. Maria Theresa, whose knowledge of military affairs might have shamed many of her generals, had pressed relentlessly for reform. Her interest in the welfare of the soldiers had gained her their unqualified respect. Austria had suffered several humiliating defeats to Prussia in the previous war, and, strongly dissatisfied with the limited help she had received from the British, now saw France as the only ally who could help her retake Silesia and check Prussia's expansion.
A further cause for war arose from the heated colonial struggle between the British Empire and French Empire which, as they both expanded, met and clashed with one another on two continents. The formal opening of hostilities in Europe was preceded by fighting in North America, where the westward expansion of the British colonies located along the eastern seaboard began to run afoul of French claims to the Mississippi valley in the late 1740s and early 1750s. In order to forestall the expansion of Virginia and Pennsylvania, in particular, the French built a line of forts in what is now western Pennsylvania in the mid-1750s. British efforts to dislodge them led to conflicts generally considered to be part of the French and Indian War, in which fighting began two years before the onset of hostilities in Europe.
Strategies.
For much of the eighteenth century, France approached its wars in the same way. It would let its colonies defend themselves, or would offer only minimal help (sending them only limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers), anticipating that fights for the colonies would likely be lost anyway. This strategy was to a degree forced upon France: geography, coupled with the superiority of the British navy, made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to French colonies. Similarly, several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any ruler of France. Given these military necessities, the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the European continent, hoping that such a force would be victorious closer to home. The plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then, in treaty negotiations, to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe in order to regain lost overseas possessions. This approach did not serve France well in the war, as the colonies were indeed lost, but although much of the European war went well, by its end France had few counterbalancing European successes.
The British—by inclination as well as for pragmatic reasons—had tended to avoid large-scale commitments of troops on the Continent. They sought to offset the disadvantage this created in Europe by allying themselves with one or more Continental powers whose interests were antithetical to those of their enemies, particularly France. For the Seven Years' War, the British chose as their principal partner the greatest military strategist of the day, Frederick the Great, and his kingdom, Prussia, then the rising power in central Europe, and paid Frederick substantial subsidies to support his campaigns. In marked contrast to France, Britain strove to actively prosecute the war in the colonies, taking full advantage of its naval power.
The Russians and the Austrians were determined to reduce the power of Prussia, the new threat on their doorstep. Along with France, plans were advanced in 1756 for mutual defense and an attack by Austria and Russia on Prussia, subsidized by France.
Europe.
1756.
The British Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle, remained optimistic that war could be prevented from breaking out in Europe by the new series of alliances. However a large French force was assembled at Toulon, and the French opened the campaign against the British by an attack on Minorca in the Mediterranean. A British attempt at relief was foiled at the Battle of Minorca and the island was captured on 28 June (for which Admiral Byng was court-martialed and executed). War between Britain and France had been formally declared on 18 May nearly two years after the first fighting had broken out in the Ohio Country.
Having received reports of the clashes in North America, and having secured the support of Great Britain with an Anglo-Prussian alliance, Frederick II of Prussia crossed the border of Saxony on 29 August 1756, one of the small German states in league with Austria. He intended this as a bold pre-emption of an anticipated Austro-French invasion of Silesia. Frederick II had three goals for his new war on Austria. First, Frederick would seize Saxony and eliminate the country as a threat to Prussia. Frederick could then use the Saxon army and the Saxon treasury to aid the Prussian war effort. Frederick's second goal was to advance his army into Bohemia where he might set up winter quarters for his army at Austria's expense. Thirdly, Frederick wanted to invade Moravia from Silesia, seize the fortress at Olműtz and advance on Vienna and force an ending to the war.
Accordingly, leaving Field Marshal Count Kurt von Schwerin in Silesia with 25,000 soldiers to guard against any incursions from Moravia or Hungary, and leaving Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt in East Prussia to guard against any Russian invasion from the east, Frederick set off with his army for Saxony. The Prussian army marched toward Saxony in three columns. On the right was a column of about 15,000 men under the command of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. On the left was a column containing 18,000 men under the command of the Duke of Bruswick-Bevern. In the centre was Frederick II, himself, accompanied by Field Marshal James Keith commanding a corps of 30,000 troops. Ferdinand of Brunswick was to close in on the town of Chemnitz. The Duke of Brunswick-Bevern was to transverse Lusatia to close in on Bautzen. Meanwhile, Frederick and Field Marshal Keith would make for Dresden.
The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered. Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons. At the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756, King Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne The Prussians then overran the Electorate, resulting in the Prussian occupation of Saxony and the surrender of the Saxon Army at Pirna in October 1756 which was then forcibly incorporated into the Prussian forces. The attack on the neutral Electorate of Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition. The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia.
Britain had been surprised by the sudden Prussian offensive, but now began shipping supplies and ₤670,000 (equivalent to ₤ million in ) to her new ally—Prussia. A combined German (Hanoverian) force was organised by the British under the Duke of Cumberland to protect Hanover from a French invasion. The British attempted to persuade the Dutch Republic to join the alliance, but the request was rejected as the Dutch wished to remain fully neutral. Despite the huge disparity in numbers, the year had been a successful one for the Prussian-led forces on the continent, in contrast to disappointing British campaigns in North America.
1757.
In early 1757, Frederick II again took the initiative by marching into the Kingdom of Bohemia, hoping to inflict a decisive defeat on the Austrian forces. After winning the bloody Battle of Prague on 6 May 1757, in which both forces suffered major casualties, the Prussians forced the Austrian forces back into the fortifications of Prague. The Prussian army then laid siege to the city. Following the battle at Prague, Frederick took 5,000 troops from the siege at Prague and sent them to reinforce the 19,000-man army under the Duke of Brunswick-Bevern at Kolin in Bohemia. This army easily pushed the light Austrian army under General Franz Leopold von Nádasdy auf Fogaras back from its positions at Gang and Kuttenmen in Bohemia to more secure positions. Nádasdy's retreat caused Marshal Daun to also retreat with his much larger Austrian army toward Deutsch-Brod to protect his now exposed position. On 16 June 1757, General Daun marched to the north-west to outflank the Prussian left. Frederick then, in turn, marched north-west on 17 June 1757 so as to outflank Daun's Austrian army. However, Daun learned of Frederick's manoeuvre and during the night of 17–18 June 1757, Daun turned his army to face Fredericks new position. On the morning of 18 June 1757 a fog settled in over the battleground. Thus Frederick remained ignorant of Daun's manoeuvre during the night. Only at 6 am when General Zieten was leading the advance guard through the town of Planjan did the Prussians learn of the true position of the Austrian army. Frederick II was at the front on his army's left wing. The Prussian left wing was strong and this was where Frederick wished to start his attack on the Austrians. The Prussians attacked in the early afternoon of 18 June 1757. However, Frederick learned that the Austrians attacked his right wing. Frederick drew troops from his left wing to shore up his right and to fill a gap in his front which developed when Major General Manstein led his troops out to attack some Croatian forces in a corn field ahead of Frederick's line. This so depleted the troops in Frederick's left wing that he was forced to call off the attack and go over to the defensive on his left wing. Still this was not enough and the Prussian left and centre began to crumble.
Thus, Frederick was defeated at the Battle of Kolin. It was his first military defeat. Not only did the lack of forces defeat Frederick at Kolin, but the losses to his army suffered in the Battle of Kolin forced Frederick to lift the siege of Prague and withdraw from Bohemia altogether.
Later that summer, the Russians had invaded Memel with 75,000 troops. Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia. However, after five days of artillery bombardment the Russian army was able to storm the fortress. The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade East Prussia and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757. Further defeats followed. Not only was Frederick forced to break off his invasion of Bohemia, but now he was forced to withdraw further back into Prussian-controlled territory. Frederick's defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunist nations into the war. Sweden declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with just 17,000 men. Sweden felt that this small army was all that was needed to occupy Pomerania and felt that the Swedish army would not need to engage in any fighting with the Prussians because the Prussians had their hands full with the war on so many other fronts.
Things were looking very grim for Prussia at this time, with the Austrians mobilising to attack Prussian-controlled soil and a French army under Soubise approaching from the west. However, in November and December of 1757, the whole situation in Germany was reversed. First, Frederick devastated Prince Soubise's French force at the Battle of Rossbach on 5 November 1757 and then routed a vastly superior Austrian force at the Battle of Leuthen on 5 December 1757 With these victories, Frederick once again established himself as Europe's premier general and his men as Europe's most accomplished soldiers. In spite of these successes, the Prussians were now facing the prospect of four major powers attacking on four fronts (France from the West, Austria from the South, Russia from the East and Sweden from the North). Meanwhile a combined force from a number of smaller German states such as Bavaria had been established under Austrian leadership, thus threatening Prussian control of Saxony.
This problem was compounded when the main Hanoverian army under Cumberland was defeated at the Battle of Hastenbeck and then forced to surrender entirely at the Convention of Klosterzeven following a French Invasion of Hanover. The Convention removed Hanover and Brunswick from the war, leaving the Western approach to Prussian territory extremely vulnerable. Frederick sent urgent requests to Britain for more substantial assistance, as he was now without any outside military support for his forces in Germany.
The British had suffered further defeats in North America, particularly at Fort William Henry. At home, however, stability had been established. Since 1756, successive governments led by Newcastle and William Pitt had both fallen. In August 1757, the two men agreed to a political partnership and formed a coalition government which gave new, firmer direction to the British war effort. The new strategy emphasised both Newcastle's commitment to British involvement on the European continent, particularly in defence of Germany, and William Pitt's determination to use British naval power to launch expeditions to seize French colonies around the globe. This "dual strategy" would dominate British policy for the next five years.
Although in late 1757, thanks to the Prussian victories at Rossbach and Leuthen, the situation appeared to have swung in Frederick's favour, it was the decision of the Russian Empire to withdraw its troops from East Prussia that dramatically altered the situation for Frederick.
Calculating that no further Russian advance was likely until 1758, Frederick moved the bulk of his eastern forces to Pomerania under the command of Marshal Lehwaldt where they were to repel the Swedish invasion. In short order, the Prussian army drove the Swedes back and occupied most of Swedish Pomerania and blockaded its capital Stralsund. George II of Great Britain, on the advice of his British ministers, revoked the Convention of Klosterzeven and Hanover reentered the war. Over the winter the new commander of the Hanoverian forces, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, regrouped his army and launched a series of offensives that drove the French back across the River Rhine.
Between 10 and 17 October 1757, a Hungarian general, Count András Hadik, serving in the Austrian army, executed what may be the most famous hussar action in history. When the Prussian King Frederick was marching south with his powerful armies, the Hungarian general unexpectedly swung his 5,000 force of mostly hussars around the Prussians and occupied part of their capital—Berlin for one night. The city was spared for a negotiated ransom of 200,000 thalers. When King Frederick heard about this shameful occupation of Berlin, he immediately sent a larger force to free the city. Hadik rode out of the city with his Hussars and safely reached the Austrian lines. Subsequently, Hadik was promoted to the rank of Marshal in the Austrian army.
1758.
In early 1758, Frederick launched an invasion of Moravia, and laid siege to Olomouc. Following an Austrian victory at the Battle of Domstadtl which wiped out a supply convoy destined for the Prussians besieging Olomouc, Frederick broke off the siege and withdrew from Moravia. It marked the end of his final attempt to launch a major invasion of Austrian territory. East Prussia had been occupied by Russian forces over the winter, and would remain under their control until 1762, although Frederick did not see the Russians as an immediate threat and instead entertained hopes of first fighting a decisive battle against Austria that would knock her out of the war.
In April 1758, the British concluded the Anglo-Prussian Convention with Frederick, in which they committed to pay him an annual subsidy of £670,000. Britain also dispatched a force of 9,000 troops to reinforce Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, the first British troop commitment on the continent and a reversal in the policy of Pitt who had previously opposed such a move. Ferdinand had succeeded in driving the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758, before crossing the Rhine with his own forces which caused alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and the brief occupation of Düsseldorf, he was then forced to withdraw across the Rhine by successful manoeuvring by larger French forces.
By this point Frederick had grown increasingly concerned about the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. On 25 August 1758, at the Battle of Zorndorf a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick fought to a standstill a Russian army of 43,000 commanded by Count Fermor. Although both sides suffered heavy casualties and the Russians withdrew from the field in good order, Frederick claimed a victory. In the undecided Battle of Tornow on 25 September, a Swedish army repulsed six assaults by a Prussian army, but did not push home an attempt to move on Berlin following the Battle of Fehrbellin.
The back-and-forth nature of the war continued as on 14 October, Marshal Daun's Austrians surprised the main Prussian army at the Battle of Hochkirch in Saxony. Frederick lost much of his artillery but retreated in good order, helped by the densely wooded landscape. The Austrians had ultimately made little progress in the campaign in Saxony despite Hochkirch and had failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough. After a thwarted attempt to take Dresden, Daun's troops were forced to withdraw to Austrian territory for the winter, so that Saxony remained under Prussian occupation.
In France, 1758 had been a disappointing year and in the wake of this a new Chief Minister, the Duc de Choiseul was appointed. Choiseul planned to end the war in 1759 by making strong attacks on Britain and Hanover.
1759–60.
The year 1759 saw some severe Prussian defeats. At the Battle of Kay, or Paltzig, the Russian Count Saltykov with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussian troops commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at Minden, Austrian general Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 men in the Battle of Maxen. Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf, the worst defeat in his military career, and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at Gross-Jägersdorf.
The French planned to invade the British Isles during 1759 by accumulating troops near the mouth of the Loire and concentrating their Brest and Toulon fleets. However, two sea defeats prevented this. In August, the Mediterranean fleet under Jean-François de La Clue-Sabran was scattered by a larger British fleet under Edward Boscawen at the Battle of Lagos. In the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November, the British admiral Edward Hawke with 23 ships of the line caught the French Brest fleet with 21 ships of the line under Marshal de Conflans and sank, captured or forced aground many of them, putting an end to the French plans.
1760 brought even more disasters to the Prussians. The Prussian general Fouqué was defeated in the Battle of Landshut. The French captured Marburg, and the Swedes part of Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania. The Hanoverians were victorious over the French at the Battle of Warburg, their continued success preventing France from sending troops to aid the Austrians against Prussia in the east. Despite this the Austrians, under the command of General Laudon captured Glatz (now Kłodzko) in Silesia. In the Battle of Liegnitz Frederick scored a victory despite being outnumbered three to one. The Russians under General Saltykov and Austrians under General Lacy briefly occupied his capital, Berlin, in October. The end of that year saw Frederick once more victorious, defeating the able Daun in the Battle of Torgau, but he suffered heavy casualties and the Austrians retreated in good order.
1761–62.
Prussia began the 1761 campaign with just 100,000 available troops, many of them new recruits. 1762 brought two new countries into the war. Britain declared war against Spain on 4 January 1762; Spain reacted by issuing their own declaration of war against Britain on 18 January. Portugal followed by joining the war on Britain's side. Spain, aided by the French, launched an invasion of Portugal and succeeded in capturing Almeida. The arrival of British reinforcements stalled a further Spanish advance, and the Battle of Valencia de Alcántara saw British-Portuguese forces overrun a major Spanish supply base. The invaders were stopped on the heights in front of Abrantes (called "the pass to Lisbon") where the Anglo-Portuguese were entrenched. Eventually the Anglo-Portuguese army, aided by the guerrillas and practicing a scorched earth strategy, chased the then hugely reduced Franco-Spanish army back to Spain, recovering almost all the lost towns, among them the Spanish headquarters in Castelo Branco full of wounded and sick that had been left behind.
In February 1761 Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick surprised French troops at Langensalza, and then advanced to besiege Cassel in March. He was forced to lift the siege and retreat after French forces regrouped and captured several thousand of his men at the Battle of Grünberg. At the Battle of Villinghausen, forces under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick defeated a 92,000-man French army. The Russians under Zakhar Chernyshev and Pyotr Rumyantsev stormed Kolberg in Pomerania, while the Austrians captured Schweidnitz. The loss of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea. In Britain, it was speculated that a total Prussian collapse was now imminent.
Britain now threatened to withdraw its subsidies if Prussia didn't seriously consider offering to make concessions to secure peace. As the Prussian armies had dwindled to just 60,000 men Frederick's survival was severely threatened. Then on 5 January 1762 the Russian Empress Elizabeth died. Her Prussophile successor, Peter III, at once recalled Russian armies from Berlin (see: the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)) and mediated Frederick's truce with Sweden. This turn of events has become known as the miracle of the House of Brandenburg. In the aftermath, Frederick was able to drive the Austrians from Silesia in the Battle of Freiberg (29 October 1762), while his Brunswick allies captured the key town of Göttingen and compounded it by taking Cassel.
The long British naval blockade of French ports had sapped the morale of the French populace. Morale declined further when news of defeat in the Battle of Signal Hill in Newfoundland reached Paris.
1763.
By 1763 Frederick had Silesia under his control and had occupied parts of Austria. The British subsidies had been withdrawn by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute, and the Russian Emperor had been overthrown by his wife Catherine the Great who now switched Russian support back to Austria and launched fresh attacks on Prussia. Austria, however, had been weakened from the war and, like most participants, was facing a severe financial crisis. In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the Treaty of Hubertusburg ending the war in central Europe.
British amphibious "descents".
Great Britain planned a "descent" (an amphibious demonstration or raid) on Rochefort, a joint operation to overrun the town and burn the shipping in the Charente. The expedition set out on 8 September 1757, Sir John Mordaunt commanding the troops and Sir Edward Hawke the fleet. On 23 September the Isle d'Aix was taken, but due to dithering by military staff such time was lost that Rochefort became unassailable, and the expedition abandoned the Isle d'Aix, returning to Great Britain on 1 October.
Despite the operational failure and debated strategic success of the descent on Rochefort, William Pitt—who saw purpose in this type of asymmetric enterprise—prepared to continue such operations. An army was assembled under the command of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough; he was aided by Lord George Sackville. The naval squadron and transports for the expedition were commanded by Richard Howe. The army landed on 5 June 1758 at Cancalle Bay, proceeded to St. Malo, and finding that it would take a prolonged siege to capture it, instead attacked the nearby port of St. Servan, and burned the shipping in the harbor amounting to roughly 80 French privateers and merchantmen, as well as four warships which were under construction. The force then re-embarked under the threat of the arrival of French relief forces. An attack on Havre de Grace was called off, and the fleet sailed on to Cherbourg; but the weather being bad and provisions low, that too was abandoned, and the expedition returned, having damaged French privateering and provided a further strategic demonstration against the French coast.
Pitt now prepared to send troops into Germany; and both Marlborough and Sackville, disgusted by what they perceived as the futility of the "descents", obtained commissions in that army. The elderly General Bligh was appointed to command a new "descent", escorted by Howe. The campaign began propitiously with the Raid on Cherbourg. With the support of the navy to bombard Cherbourg and cover their landing, the army drove off the French force detailed to oppose their landing, captured Cherbourg, and destroyed its fortifications, docks, and shipping.
The troops were reembarked and the fleet moved them to the Bay of St. Lunaire in Brittany where, on 3 September, they were landed to again operate against St. Malo; however, this action proved impractical. Worsening weather forced the two armies to separate: the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of St. Cast, while the army proceeded overland. The tardiness of Bligh in moving his forces allowed a French force of 10,000 men from Brest to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops. A rear-guard of 1,400 under General Dury held off the French while the rest of the army embarked; they could not be saved, 750, including Dury, were killed and the rest captured.
Colonies.
The colonial conflict mainly between France and Britain occurred in India, North America, Europe, the Caribbean isles, the Philippines and coastal Africa. During the course of the war, Great Britain gained enormous areas of land and influence at the expense of the French.
Great Britain lost Minorca in the Mediterranean to the French in 1756 but captured the French colonies in Senegal on the African continent in 1758. The British Royal Navy captured the French sugar colonies of Guadeloupe in 1759 and Martinique in 1762, as well as the Spanish cities of Havana in Cuba, and Manila in the Philippines, both prominent Spanish colonial cities. However expansion into the hinterlands of both cities met with stiff resistance. In the Philippines, the British were confined to Manila in a deteriorating military situation before their agreed upon withdrawal at the war's end.
North America.
The campaign began with the French desire to keep control of the fur trade from the Ohio River Valley westward. Accordingly, the French sought to build a cordon of forts that extended from the Gulf of St Lawrence to the Mississippi River Delta. This line of forts was intended to delineate the eastern border of the French colony in North America—New France. The forts were meant to prevent any incursion by fur traders or settlers from the east—from the British colonies that had established themselves along the eastern coast of North America.
The British settlers along the coast, on the other hand, were upset that French troops would now be very close to the western borders of their English-speaking colonies. They felt the French would encourage their tribal allies among the North American natives to attack the British colonies. Also, the British settlers wanted access to the fertile land of the Ohio River Valley for the new settlers that were flooding into the British colonies seeking farm land. Thus the most important French fort being planned was the fort intended to occupy a position at "the Forks" where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio River (present day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).
The Iroquois Confederation represented a third force in the struggle over the Ohio River Valley. The Confederation was made up of five different Native American tribes—the Mohawks, the Oneidas, the Onondagas, the Cayugas and the Senecas. Later the Iroquois Confederation would become a "six nation confederation" with the addition of the Tuscaroras to the league. These tribes had traditionally been based in present day upstate New York, but years of intertribal peace from 1713 to 1744 had converted the confederation into a powerful organisation whose political influence extended over present-day Virginia, West Virginia and the Ohio River Valley and over the dependent tribes—the Delawares and the Shawnees who actually lived there.
However, by 1754 the Iroquois Confederation was being pressed hard by the influx of new settlers moving into their tribal lands. The very existence of these tribes on their own traditional lands was now being threatened. Accordingly, the Iroquois Confederation was seeking some independent and neutral way between the British and the French which would preserve their heritage. They called this strategy of playing the French and British interests off against one another "aggressive neutrality."
So the proposed French fort at the Forks at the head of the Ohio River set off concerns within three contesting groups of people. Whoever, controlled the Forks, held the key to the whole of the Ohio River Valley. Both the French and the British claimed the land in the disputed Ohio Valley. The British first tried to negotiate. They sent a delegation to the French to discourage the idea of building a fort at the Forks. When that failed the British sent a crew of soldiers and workers to the Forks to pre-empt the French by building a British fort on the location before the French. The French then attacked the British settlement of soldiers and workers and destroyed the works that the British started to build at the site. After evicting the British from the Forks, the French built their fort—Fort Duquesne—at the Forks. During an attack on the French led by George Washington, then a lieutenant colonel in the British colonial militia Virginia Regiment, at Jumonville Glen on 28 May 1754, the British attacked with bayonets the 31 French sleeping in the early morning hours. Ten were killed, including commander Jumonville, whose brother pursued Washington.
However, the French attacked Washington's army at Fort Necessity on 3 July 1754 and forced Washington to surrender at the conclusion of the Battle of Fort Necessity. As a sign that this small skirmish was becoming an ever-widening war, both France and Britain then sent troops in strength to North America. In June 1755, British Major General Edward Braddock led about 2,000 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition to retake Fort Duquesne but the expedition was a disaster. In further action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship "Alcide" on 8 June 1755, capturing her and two troop ships. The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. In September 1755, French and British troops met in the inconclusive Battle of Lake George.
The third British action was the assault on Acadia on 15 June 1755 in the Battle of Fort Beauséjour, which was immediately followed by their expulsion of the Acadians. These actions contributed to the formal declarations of war in spring 1756.
During the war, the Seven Nations of Canada were allied with the French; they were Native Canadian groups living in the Laurentian valley—the Algonquin, the Abenaki, the Huron and others. Although the Algonquin tribe and the Seven Nations were not directly concerned with the fate of the Ohio River Valley, they had been one of the victims of the Iroquois Confederation. The Iroquois had encroached on Algonquin territory and pushed the Algonquins west beyond Lake Michigan. Thus, the Algonquin and the Seven Nations were interested in fighting against the Iroquois. Throughout New England, New York and the North-west, Native American tribes formed differing alliances with the major belligerents, with many siding with the French. They hoped to push out the British colonial settlers for good. The Iroquois, dominant in what is now Upstate New York, sided with the British but did not play a large role in the war.
In 1756 and 1757 the French won major victories at Oswego and Fort William Henry. Although, the latter win was tainted when France's native allies broke the terms of capitulation and attacked the retreating British column, slaughtering wounded soldiers and taking captives. French naval deployments in 1757 also successfully defended the key fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island, securing the approaches to Quebec in Canada.
William Pitt's focus on the colonies for the 1758 campaign paid off with the taking of Louisbourg after French reinforcements were blocked by the Battle of Cartagena, and the successful capture of Fort Duquesne and Fort Frontenac. The British also continued the process of deporting the Acadian population with a wave of major operations against Île Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island), the St. John River valley, and the Petitcodiac River valley. The British successes were overshadowed by their embarrassing defeat in the Battle of Carillon, in which 4,000 French troops repulsed 16,000 British troops.
All of Britain's campaigns against New France succeeded in 1759, part of what became known as an "Annus Mirabilis". Fort Niagara and Fort Carillon on 8 July 1758 fell to sizable British forces, cutting off French frontier forts further west. On 13 September 1759, following a three-month siege of Quebec, General James Wolfe defeated the French at the Plains of Abraham outside the city. The French staged a counteroffensive in the spring of 1760, with some success in a victory at the Battle of Sainte-Foy, but failed to retake Quebec due to a lack of naval support. French forces retreated to Montreal, where on 8 September they surrendered in the face of overwhelming British numerical superiority. This defeat has had serious ramifications in Canada to this day. The Quebec sovereignty movement sees this as their principle's defining moment.
Seeing French defeat, in 1760 the Seven Nations of Canada resigned from the war and negotiated the Treaty of Kahnawake with the British. Among its conditions was their unrestricted travel between Canada and New York, as the nations had extensive trade between Montreal and Albany, as well as populations living throughout the area.
In 1762 toward the end of the war, French forces attacked St. John's, Newfoundland. If successful, the expedition would have strengthened France's hand at the negotiating table. Though they took St. John's and raided nearby settlements, the French forces were eventually defeated by British troops at the Battle of Signal Hill. This was the final battle of the war in North America, and it forced the French to surrender to the British under Lieutenant Colonel William Amherst. The victorious British now controlled all of eastern North America.
The history of the Seven Years' War in North America, particularly the expulsion of the Acadians, siege of Quebec, the death of Wolfe and the Battle of Fort William Henry, generated a vast number of ballads, broadsides, images, and novels (see Longfellow's "Evangeline", "The Death of General Wolfe"; Wood, James Fenimore Cooper's "The Last of the Mohicans"), maps and other printed materials, which testify to how this event captured the imagination of the British and North American public long after Wolfe's death in 1759.
South America.
Between September 1762 and April 1763, the Spanish forces led by don Pedro Antonio de Cevallos, Governor of Buenos Aires (and later first Viceroy of the Rio de la Plata), made a campaign against the Portuguese in South America. The Portuguese territories of Colonia do Sacramento and Rio Grande de São Pedro were conquered by the Spaniards and the Portuguese forces were forced to surrender and retreat. The Colonia of Sacramento and the near territories were under Spanish control until the Treaty of Paris (1763).
As consequence of the war the Valdivian Fort System, a Spanish defensive complex in southern Chile, was updated and reinfoced from 1764 onwards.
Mughal Empire.
In India the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in Europe resulted in a renewal of the long running conflict between French and British trading companies in the region for influence. The war spread beyond southern India and into Bengal, where British forces under Robert Clive recaptured Calcutta from the Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah, a French ally, and ousted him from his throne at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. In the same year the British also captured the French settlement in Bengal at Chandernagar.
However, the war was decided in the south. Although the French captured Cuddalore, their siege of Madras failed, while the British commander Sir Eyre Coote decisively defeated the French under the Comte de Lally at the Battle of Wandiwash in 1760 and overran the French territory of the Northern Circars. The French capital of Pondicherry fell to the British in 1761; together with the fall of the lesser French settlements of Karikal and Mahé this effectively eliminated French power from India.
West Africa.
In 1758 at the urging of an American merchant, Thomas Cumming, Pitt dispatched an expedition to take the French settlement at Saint Louis. The British captured Senegal with ease in May 1758 and brought home large amounts of captured goods. The success of the mission convinced Pitt to launch two further expeditions to take the island of Gorée and the French trading post on the Gambia. The loss of these valuable colonies further weakened the French economy.
Outcome.
The Anglo-French hostilities were ended in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris, which involved a complex series of land exchanges, the most important being France's cession to Spain of Louisiana, and to Great Britain the rest of New France except for the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. Faced with the choice of retrieving either New France or its Caribbean island colonies of Guadeloupe and Martinique, France chose the latter to retain these lucrative sources of sugar, writing off New France as an unproductive, costly territory. France also returned Minorca to the British. Spain lost control of Florida to Great Britain, but received part of New Orleans and the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi River from the French. The exchanges suited the British as well, as their own Caribbean islands already supplied ample sugar, and with the acquisition of New France and Florida, they now controlled all of North America east of the Mississippi.
In India, the British retained the Northern Circars, but returned all the French trading ports. The treaty, however, required that the fortifications of these settlements must be destroyed and never rebuilt, while only minimal garrisons could be maintained there, thus rendering them worthless as military bases. Combined with the loss of France's ally in Bengal and the defection of Hyderabad to the British side as a result of the war, this effectively brought French power in India to an end, making way for British hegemony and eventual control of the subcontinent.
European boundaries were returned to their "status quo ante bellum" by the Treaty of Hubertusburg (February 1763). Prussia thus maintained its possession of Silesia, having survived the combined assault of three neighbours, each larger than itself. Prussia gained enormously in influence at the expense of the Holy Roman Empire. This increase in Prussian influence, it is argued, marks the beginning of the modern German state, an event at least as influential as the colonial empire Great Britain had gained. Others, including Fred Anderson, author of "Crucible of War", believe the war was needless and overly costly.
France's navy was crippled by the war. Only after an ambitious rebuilding programme by France in combination with Spain was it again able to challenge Britain's command of the sea.
However, the British government was close to bankruptcy, and Britain now faced the delicate task of pacifying its new French-Canadian subjects, as well as the many American Indian tribes who had supported France. George III's Proclamation of 1763, which forbade white settlement beyond the crest of the Appalachians, was intended to appease the latter, but led to considerable outrage in the Thirteen Colonies whose inhabitants were eager to acquire native lands. The Quebec Act of 1774, similarly intended to win over the loyalty of French Canadians, also spurred resentment among American colonists. Victorious in 1763, Great Britain would soon face another military threat in North America—this time from its longtime subjects, who no longer had to fear a hostile neighbouring power.
The Seven Years' War was the last major military conflict fought on the European continent before the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792.

Fort McLoughlin

Fort McLoughlin was a fur trading post established in 1833 by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) on Campbell Island in present-day British Columbia, Canada. The site is believed to have been at McLoughlin Bay on the northeast side of Campbell Island and is associated with the relocation of the Heiltsuk community of Bella Bella from its former location on islets near Denny Island. The McLoughlin name, which is that of John McLoughlin, regional head of company operations at that time, is also found in a lake and a creek entering that bay, and was conferred on these locations after the fort had closed.
One of the primary reasons for the establishment of Fort McLoughlin, as well as Fort Simpson to the north, was to undermine the American dominance of the Maritime Fur Trade. By 1830 the higher prices paid for furs by American coastal traders had resulted in an indigenous fur trading system that diverted furs from the Interior's New Caledonia district of the HBC to the coast. Fort McLoughlin and Fort Simpson were built to intercept these furs before they could reach American traders, who had no permanent posts on the coast. The strategy was ultimately successful. By 1837 American competition was essentially over. Furs from the interior reached the coast along indigenous pathways, or "grease trails", one of which had been followed by Alexander MacKenzie in 1793. By the late 1830s HBC traders of New Caledonia were complaining that their furs were finding their way to Fort McLoughlin, where they were fetching higher prices. By the end of the decade, with American competition reduced, the HBC was able to fix prices uniformly and eliminate much of the flow of furs to the coast, which by its nature was less secure than the Interior.
Fort McLoughlin was built in May or June, 1833, on a protected bay on Campbell Island, at Lama Passage in Fitz Hugh Sound, part of what today is called the Inside Passage. At first the post was known simply as Milbanke Sound, after its ocean access. The fort was situated in the midst of a densely populated indigenous area. The Nuxálk, or "Bella Coola" people were the main traders at the fort. George Simpson, wrote that the fort was near a village of about 500 "Ballabollas" (Bella Bellas, known properly as the Heiltsuk). William Fraser Tolmie, who was stationed at the fort during its early years, wrote about "Quaghcuils" (Kwakwaka'wakw, possibly specifically the Kwagu'ł of Fort Rupert), "Kitamats" (Kitimaat, a Haisla subgroup), and "Chimnseyans" (Tsimshians) trading there, in addition to the Nuxálk. Duncan Finlayson wrote in 1836 that indigenous people trading at Fort McLoughlin included the "Bela hoola" (Bella Coola), the "Wacash tribe of Milbank Sound" (the Xaixais, today located at Klemtu), the "Oyalla tribe", and the "Chichysh". Charles Ross, who took over command of the fort in 1842, estimated the local "Billbillah" population at 1,500, and the "Bellwhoola" at 650.
Although successful in the fur trade, Fort McLoughlin was not self-sufficient in food. Supplies were brought annually from Fort Langley, Fort Nisqually, and Fort Simpson. In 1841 Sir George Simpson wrote that Fort McLoughlin was visited by about 5,200 natives from seven main villages, trading furs worth about 2,500 to 3,000 pounds sterling. Both Simpson and Alexander Ross agreed that the fort's annual profit was about 1,500 pounds.
Fort McLoughlin was closed by Sir George Simpson in the early 1840s because the HBC's steamship "Beaver" was able to collect furs along the coast without the need for permanent posts. Although the fort was said to be wholly abandoned in 1843 with its men and stores transferred to establish Fort Victoria, certain of its articles were transferred to Fort Rupert in 1849 and the site remained in use from time to time until 1878.

Wolfgang Helbig

Wolfgang Helbig (February 2, 1839 – October 6, 1915) was a German classical archaeologist born in Dresden.
From 1856 to 1861 he studied philology and archaeology at the Universities of Göttingen, where he also became member of Burschenschaft (fraternity) Hannovera and Bonn, afterwards becoming a member of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) to Rome (1862). During his career he traveled extensively throughout Italy, Greece, Russia, France and North Africa. From 1887, he lived in Rome as a private scholar and art dealer, and served as a broker of numerous works of art for the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. 
Helbig is known for his scientific studies of the wall paintings of Pompeii. In 1887, he presented the now controversial Praeneste fibula. In 1892, he published the first edition of "Führer durch die öffentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertümer in Rom", a very popular guide to classical antiquities in Rome. 
He died in 1915 in Rome.

Germelshausen

Germelshausen is a story by Friedrich Gerstäcker concerning a cursed village that sank into the earth long ago and is permitted to appear for only one day every century. The protagonist is a young artist (Arnold) who happens to traverse the locale at the time for the town's appearance. He encounters, and becomes smitten with, a young woman (Gertrud) from Germelshausen. The romantic tale ends with his leaving the vicinity just in time to avoid being entombed with the village and its denizens, but thereby being sundered from his love forever.
The basic concept is an old German motif that appears in works of Mueller, Heine, Uhland and others. The curse may affect a town, a castle or even a single house, but the narratable content remains largely unchanged. Germelshausen is noteworthy for the affecting nature of the story, and because it is widely credited as having inspired the musical "Brigadoon". 
Although "Germelshausen" is credited as having inspired the Broadway musical "Brigadoon", Alan Jay Lerner stated in his memoirs, "The Street Where I Live", that "Nevertheless, to this day chroniclers of the musical theater invariably state Brigadoon was based on a folk tale and give Nathan as their authority."

Lucas Fitzgerald

Lucas Patrick Fitzgerald is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera "Neighbours", played by Scott Major. The actor had previously appeared in "Neighbours" in 1993 as Darren Stark. He received a call to play Lucas shortly after he was getting the feel for acting again. Major accepted the role as the character seemed like fun and he wanted to work with his friend Brett Tucker. He made his first screen appearance as Lucas during the episode broadcast on 22 July 2008. The following year, Major signed a new contract and was promoted to the regular cast. On 1 July 2013, it was confirmed that Major had left "Neighbours" and his character departed on 24 September 2013. 
Lucas is Daniel Fitzgerald's (Brett Tucker) brother. He has been portrayed as being cheeky, a bit of a "bad boy", a rebel and a ladies man. His storylines have included re-connecting with his brother, fighting a gambling addiction, developing relationships with Elle Robinson (Pippa Black), Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), Emilia Jovanovic (Freya Stafford) and Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) being injured in a motorbike accident, getting involved in illegal street racing, becoming a father and being diagnosed with testicular cancer. For his portrayal of Lucas, Major received a nomination for Best Daytime Star at the 2013 Inside Soap Awards.
Casting.
Scott Major first appeared in "Neighbours" in 1993 as Darren Stark. Major had just returned to Australia, after being overseas for a few years and was getting the feel for acting again, when he received a call to play Lucas. He agreed to play the role, saying "It's a different character and it seemed like it could be a lot of fun. In Australia as an actor, to get a regular show it's really hard". Major also attributes the chance to work with Brett Tucker, who he had known for about ten years, as one of the reasons why he accepted the role of Lucas. In 2009, Major signed a two year contract and was promoted to regular cast member. In November 2011, Major told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he would like to stay with "Neighbours" as long as he keeps enjoying it. He said "At the moment, I still love working on the show and look forward to coming to work every day. I have a ball. I keep my outside interests active as well, which keeps me fresh." That same year saw Julian Mineo play a five-year-old Lucas in flashbacks.
Development.
Characterisation.
Lucas is Daniel Fitzgerald's (Brett Tucker) younger brother. A writer for Network Ten described him as being a bit of a "bad boy" who is always the life of the party. They also stated that he loves "being a hero to his mates", but underneath he is a sensitive guy. A Holy Soap reporter called Lucas cheeky, cocky and "a ladies' man." Major branded Lucas a great character to play, saying "He's got all the right elements that I'd want in a character, he doesn't take anything too serious. It's really fun". As Lucas rides a motorbike, Major had to get a motorbike licence, so he could accurately portray this element of his character. An "Inside Soap" columnist quipped that Lucas was a "typical Aussie bloke-next door." They said that if anyone needs a job doing, then Lucas would do it well and throw a few jokes in while he works. 
Lucas is not a stranger to hard work and he is employed as both a mechanic and a teacher. Major believed that Lucas would always be a rebel, saying "I think Lucas would like to think he could be on the straight and narrow, but there is always going to be something in him that will push him toward something more edgy." In July 2011, executive producer, Susan Bower, called Lucas a "gorgeous, blue-collar larrikin." A few months later, Major revealed viewers had not seen the last of Lucas's edgier side, which he said was "not pretty." Of what he has liked about playing Lucas, Major quipped "I like the fact Lucas does stupid things. I think that's very real. He acts first and goes from the heart and messes up big time. He says stupid things and gets jealous. He should probably learn from his mistakes! I'm really fond of Lucas." The actor added that there was nothing big that he disliked about his character.
Relationships.
Elle Robinson.
Lucas begins a relationship with Elle Robinson (Pippa Black) following his failed relationship with Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Major said that Lucas cannot figure Elle out at first, but he is attracted to her. They are opposites and Lucas calls Elle "Princess". Major added "It's not smooth sailing for either of them, and it's still up in the air as to whether they'll finally get it together or not." Major explained that little things keep Lucas and Elle coming back to each other and that there are comedic elements to their relationship. Of Lucas and Elle, Bower commented "They're our moonlighting couple. They're chalk and cheese and they'll always be chalk and cheese". She said that they are "crazy about each other", but they are always splitting up and getting back together again. Within their relationship, Bower said that they brought in an important issue that concerns a lot of people, "how does one get an adrenalin rush?" Lucas and Elle are "high rollers", so when they get together they need to look elsewhere for their adrenalin rush. 
When Elle and Lucas split because he is struggling with a gambling addiction, Elle decides to get revenge on him and invites him to her father's stag night at a casino. However, Elle is left feeling guilty about what she has done. The couple get back together, but when Elle discovers that Lucas has withdrawn a large amount of money, she worries that he has started gambling again. However, Lucas brings out a ring and proposes to Elle at the Erinsborough High Deb ball. Elle accepts, but she is late offered a job in New York and Lucas tells her to follow her dreams and they say goodbye at the airport. During an interview with Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy in March 2011, Major said that he missed the Lucas and Elle storylines, particularly when they both worked for the "Erinsborough News". He explained "There was a lot of comedy involved but it also came across as a very deep love."
Stephanie Scully.
In January 2010, Holy Soap revealed that Lucas and Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) would begin dating. Steph helps Lucas recover from injuries he sustains after a motorbike crash. As they spend more time together, Lucas realises that he loves Steph and he tells her about his feelings. However, he is unaware that Steph has slept with his brother and is pregnant with his child. The couple later split when the truth comes out, but Major told Holy Soap that they could get back together. Of the situation, Major said "It's definitely what Lucas is hoping for. There will be lots of obstacles along the way but hopefully they might be able to get together before she departs." One of the obstacles comes after Steph accidentally kills Ringo Brown (Sam Clark). Lucas tries to support Steph, but she pushes him away, as she sees the life she could have had with him and it is too hard for to bear. Lucas does not understand why, but Major said that he still loves her and added "They're a male and female version of each other." Holy Soap said that despite Lucas's flings with other woman, "no one quite matches up to Steph." Major explained that Lucas and Steph are soulmates and when she is placed on trial for killing Ringo, he realises that he might lose her. Major revealed that Lucas decides to act as the trial may leave him "devastated." He said "After being pushed away and pushed away by Steph, he figures that the only way he might be with her finally is to tell her how he feels." Lucas offers to go on the run with Steph, which leaves her with a "life-changing decision to make." Steph chooses not to run and she is later sent to prison.
Emilia Jovanovic.
In late 2011, Lucas meets a new love interest in the form of Emilia Jovanovic (Freya Stafford). Of his character's introduction to Emilia, Major explained "In their first meeting, Lucas catches Emilia on the street with her bonnet up and I don't think you could get a better intro for Lucas as an icebreaker than someone who has broken down. He's in his element and goes to the damsel in distress." Emilia has an Austin Healey Sprite, which is a car Lucas has a passion for. There is an instant connection between them and they flirt with each other. Lucas is initially unaware Emilia is Michael Williams' (Sandy Winton) sister-in-law, but Major said when he discovers how they know each other, it is not a big deal to him. Lucas is just thinks that it is great Emilia has a connection on the street. Michael warns Lucas that Emilia is bad news and Lucas takes that seriously. He puts Emilia to the test, which she passes. Major explained he was enjoying working with Stafford and thought Lucas was looking for love and stability. The actor added "He has had a rough trot so it would be nice to see him with someone he is happy with." 
Lucas and Emilia's relationship progresses and they decide to give in to their "simmering passion" after sneaking into Toadfish Rebecchi's (Ryan Moloney) house. Major told "Inside Soap" that Emilia needs some lemongrass for a recipe and Lucas knows Toadie has some, so they let themselves in. However, Lucas forgets about the lemongrass and he engages Emilia in some "saucy fun" in the living room. Major said "It's a little bit cheeky, but it's all fun and games – until they fall back on the couch and it breaks!" Lucas and Emilia are mortified at breaking Toadie's couch, but Major said this could be the start of something serious for the couple. The actor explained Lucas and Emilia are about to go public with their relationship, which is a big step forward for them both. Lucas learns Emilia moonlights as a nude model in her spare time and he struggles with her free-spirited attitude. Lucas tries to tell Emilia he is fine with it, but when she presses him, he eventually reveals he is uncomfortable. Of Emilia's reaction, Carena Crawford of "All About Soap" said "Emilia's understanding, but she starts to doubt whether the pair have enough connection to keep their relationship going." 
Emilia later tells Lucas she needs some space, which prompts Lucas to come up with a way to show her how laid back he is. Lucas invites Emilia to the garage and he then gets naked, showing her how open-minded he can be. Crawford said Emilia cannot help but smile at the effort he has gone to and she gives him another chance. Lucas is hurt when he and Emilia break up. He is unaware that Emilia has feelings for Michael and when asked if Lucas would set out for revenge after being dumped for his best friend, Major told a writer for "TV Week" "If Lucas finds out, the people involved had better look out, as a heartbroken Lucas would be capable of just about anything!" Lucas hopes to reconcile with Emilia when he notices her acting strangely towards him, but he is shocked and devastated when he discovers she is in a relationship with Michael. Lucas "feels like a complete fool" when Michael confirms the news.
Vanessa Villante.
Following his break up with Emilia, Lucas meets Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata), who makes an instant impression on him. Vanessa goes back to Lucas' house and they have a one-night stand. The following morning Vanessa is still there and she cooks breakfast for both Lucas and Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver). Major told a writer for "Inside Soap" that both Lucas and Vanessa agree that they do not want a relationship and Lucas expects that he will never see her again. However, a few weeks later Lucas finds Vanessa waiting for him in his kitchen, just as he brings home Nadia Wiseman (Amy Costa) from Charlie's. Major explained "It's all very awkward, of course, and the woman he's just picked up decides to go." Lucas is annoyed by the interruption, but Vanessa then reveals that she is pregnant, which turns his world upside down. Susan Hill of the "Daily Star" quipped "The carefree lad can't believe their steamy one-night stand led to this." 
Vanessa tells Lucas that she does not want to pressure him into anything, but Major commented that Lucas is worried she is after the money he inherited the previous year. However, after he confronts her about it, Vanessa leaves, saying he will not see her again. Major said "Vanessa feels that she did the right thing by coming to tell Lucas, and got slapped in the face for her trouble. She reckons that if Lucas doesn't want anything to do with her or the baby, it's fine. She doesn't need him." Lucas later questions Vanessa about how she can be certain the baby is his and Sumarwata stated that it was not the response Vanessa imagined. Lucas does not accept his new responsibilities towards Vanessa and the baby and Hill said he just wants her to disappear. Vanessa finds employment as head chef at Lassiter's Hotel, infuriating Lucas. He then tells her employer, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), that she is pregnant and she loses the job.
Lucas' feelings for Vanessa start to intensify and he realises that he has fallen in love with her. Lucas struggles to bring himself to tell Vanessa about his feelings, but he does reveal that he plans to buy the house they have been renting. Major told "TV Week"s' Jackie Brygel "Lucas realises he has to man up and make some bold decisions. He wants to provide for his family, even though they aren't a conventional family." Lucas does reveal his feeling for Vanessa at his gamblers' support group and he then becomes determined to do whatever it takes to keep Vanessa "front and centre in his life." Major explained that his confession to the group makes his decision to buy the house feel like the right choice. However, Lucas is unaware that Vanessa has fallen in love with Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber).
Illegal street racing.
When Lucas becomes strapped for money and needs something to fill the void left by his gambling addiction, his friend, Billy (Jez Constable), introduces him to Garland Cole (Jack Finsterer), who gets Lucas involved in rebirthing cars and illegal street racing. Major told Digital Spy that the street racing storyline gave him the chance to explore the darker side of Lucas. He explained "As an actor, it would be quite boring to play the good guy all the time and I love playing Lucas when he's being the bad boy. The storyline itself has allowed us to go to new locations – something different – and the good thing about the storyline initially for me was that it was initially Lucas on his own." After Steph goes to jail, Lucas, who had considered settling down, rebels against suburban life. His motivation for street racing is the rush he gets from it, not money. Garland asks Lucas to throw a race and Major said that Lucas is "very proud" and he races to win, so he refuses to throw the race and has to face the consequences. Major added "Lucas is in a very steep downward spiral and unless something pulls him up soon, it could all end in tears." Lucas tries to do the right thing and he also tries to look out for Kate (Ashleigh Brewer) and Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones), who have become his family. Major said that Lucas will "always live life on the edge", but he would like to see his character helping out children who have gone off the rails in the future.
Testicular cancer.
On 26 March 2013, it was announced that Lucas would be diagnosed with cancer. Shortly after learning that his son, Patrick, has been given the all-clear, Karl informs Lucas that he may be seriously ill. Major told "TV Week's" Thomas Mitchell, "Patrick has had some heart problems and he has an operation to finally fix his valve. Lucas donates blood for the transfusion – and, after that, Karl comes to him with some bad news. He's found Lucas's white blood cell count is quite high, which could be an indicator of an immune deficiency problem and may even be cancer." The news "knocks him for six" and Lucas tries to keep it a secret until he knows for sure, which puts a strain on his relationship with Vanessa. Major explained that Lucas does not want to tell Vanessa about the possibility of cancer because they have been through so much with Patrick and his illness. Major believed that Lucas does not want to reveal his news to Vanessa because he does not want to admit to himself how serious his condition could be. 
Karl advises Lucas to undergo more tests immediately, while Lucas hopes for the best. Major hoped the episodes featuring Lucas's cancer diagnosis would help raise awareness of "early detection and future research." The actor revealed that he had lost his father to mantle cell lymphoma, while one of his friends was fighting leukaemia. Major said "I think it is very important to raise awareness of all kinds of cancer so to use a platform like "Neighbours", which has millions of viewers, worldwide is a fantastic opportunity. I was very happy to accept the story. Sadly, everyone in their life time will be touched by cancer in someway." Major also worked with the Cancer Council of Victoria with their awareness and fundraising campaigns.
Departure.
On 1 July 2013, it was announced that Major had left "Neighbours". The actor finished filming with the show the previous week and the cast and crew attended a farewell party for him on 28 June. Major explained that the producers had told him that Lucas had run his course, but they did not want him to leave and offered him the opportunity to direct some episodes of the show. The actor commented "When I first found out it was a bit like a girlfriend breaking up with you when you're not ready to break-up. 'I'm still into this relationship, how can you not want me?!'" Lucas remained on-screen for a few months after Major's departure and details of his exit were initially kept secret. A show spokesperson stated "There's a big few months ahead for Lucas. After so many ups and downs with Vanessa, it'll be interesting to see whether the couple get a happy ending or if there's more heartbreak in store." Major later said that as an actor you do not get a choice with your final storyline, but he was happy with how the writers had stayed true to the character. He was also pleased that he was given "a massive challenge" as an actor and added that Lucas would go down "a very dark road" before he leaves. Lucas departed on 24 September 2013.
Storylines.
Lucas had a troubled relationship with his brother Daniel following a near-fatal motorbike accident when they were younger. Dan had run Lucas off the road and Lucas was left with the assumption that Dan had done it intentionally. Lucas battled a gambling addiction, which ended up costing him his relationship with his then girlfriend, Natasha Curtis. Lucas became a mechanic for motorbike firm, Reyada, and also showcased photography work under the name George Hanson. Lucas goes to Charlie's and flirts with Libby Kennedy. When he fails to secure a date with her, his friends remove his clothes and tie him to a lamp post. Libby unties him and agrees to go on a date with him. Lucas and Libby go out a few times, before she discovers he is Dan's brother. Dan and Lucas fight and Lucas almost falls from a balcony and Dan's shoulder is dislocated. The brothers agree to set aside their differences. Lucas begins a relationship with Elle Robinson and finds employment at the local garage. 
Lucas starts gambling again and gets into debt with Johnno Brewer (Damien Aylward). Lucas is forced to ask Dan for help. When Johnno causes a car crash, which claims the life of Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon), Lucas blames himself and starts to self-destruct. Lucas meets with Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey), his Gamblers Anonymous sponsor and she helps him with his problems. Lucas proposes to Elle and she accepts, despite opposition from Dan and Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Elle gets a job overseas and Lucas encourages her to go. Dan also leaves town after his marriage to Libby breaks down. Lucas is involved in a motorbike crash and he suffers spinal injuries. He attends rehab and befriends Billy Forman. Lucas' co-worker, Stephanie Scully, invites him to stay with her and Lucas declares his love for her. They then begin dating. Steph suddenly leaves town and on her return, she tells Lucas she has got back together with Toadfish Rebecchi. Lucas damages Toadie's car and he unsuccessfully sets out to try and win Steph back.
Lucas sets up the Blokes Club, along with Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver), Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) and Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister). Lucas becomes good friends with Michael Williams and he is given a job teaching technical classes at Erinsborough High. Paul reveals Steph is carrying Dan's child and Lucas retreats to the shed. Lucas has a one-night stand with Libby and moves into Number 24. Lucas kisses Steph and he tells her he still loves her. During Steph's trial for culpable driving, Lucas asks her to run away with him, but she turns him down and is sent to prison. Lucas gets involved with local criminal, Garland Cole (Jack Finsterer), and illegal street racing. Garland orders Lucas to throw a race and lose, but Lucas does not listen and Garland has him beaten up and his house trashed. Lucas is shocked to find Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) undercover during one of the races. Mark asks Lucas to help him get Garland and he agrees. Garland asks Lucas to rebirth a car and when he comes to pick it up, he is arrested.
Lucas supports Sonya after she admits she is Callum Jones' (Morgan Baker) mother and Toadie throws her out. Lucas manages to convince Toadie that Sonya loves him. Lucas gives Chris Pappas (James Mason) a part-time job at the garage. When his father dies, Lucas is left undecided about going to his funeral as he did not respect his father. Peter Noonan (James Saunders) gets in touch with Lucas to discuss his father's will and inheritance. Lucas is given his father's ashes, which he later scatters over a football field. Lucas offers Sonya his inheritance, so she can buy the community garden, but she turns him down. Lucas begins dating Michelle Tran (HaiHa Le), but when he starts to find her annoying and thinks their relationship is moving too fast, he breaks up with her. Lucas decides to use his inheritance to purchase the garage and he gives Chris an apprenticeship. Chris quits his job, when Lucas becomes reluctant to do anything about Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), who makes derogatory remarks about gay people. Lucas apologises and Chris accepts his job back.
The Hamilton Group offer Lucas a large sum of money for his garage, so they can build a car park on it for their new shopping complex. Lucas declines the offer. Lucas meets Emilia Jovanovic and he fixes her car. He invites Emilia to a picnic in his van and they begin dating. Lucas later learns she is Michael's sister in law. Lucas discovers his garage has been sabotaged and he fails a safety inspection. He blames Toadie and his law firm, who are representing The Hamilton Group. When Chris is attacked at the garage, Lucas discovers the culprit was working for Peter Noonan and he tells Toadie his boss is corrupt. Lucas plans a trip to Sydney to visit Dan and he invites Emilia to go with him. Lucas and Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) find Lewis Walton (Andy McPhee), the man who attacked who Chris, and they call the police to have him arrested. Lucas is shocked when he learns Emilia moonlights as a nude model and his reaction causes Emilia to slow their relationship down. Lucas apologises and later tells Emilia he loves her.
Emilia breaks up with Lucas and he later sees her kissing Michael. After confronting his friend, Lucas goes to Charlie's and meets Vanessa Villante. They have a one-night stand. Vanessa returns a month later and reveals to Lucas that she is pregnant. He questions whether he is the father and Vanessa confirms that he is, but she wants nothing from him. Lucas accidentally reveals Vanessa's pregnancy to Paul, costing her a job at Lassiter's. She confronts him about it in front of Kate, who later asks Vanessa to move in. When he realises Rhys Lawson is interested in Vanessa, Lucas warns him to stay away from her. However, Rhys and Vanessa begin dating. Lucas decides that he wants to become more involved with the baby and attends Vanessa's first scan. After attending a GA meeting, Lucas opens up to Vanessa about his addiction. Number 24 goes up for auction and Lucas decides to purchase it for himself and Vanessa. However, he is outbid by Ajay Kapoor (Sachin Joab) and later buys Number 32 instead. 
Lucas develops feelings for Vanessa and both Lou and Sonya encourage him to tell her. Vanessa's mother, Francesca (Carmelina di Guglielmo), insists that Lucas and Vanessa get married. Lucas agrees, thinking that Vanessa will fall in love with him. During the wedding, Vanessa struggles with her vows and flees the church. Francesca disowns Vanessa and she apologises to Lucas. Vanessa later tells Lucas how much she wants her mother around for the baby and Lucas goes to talk to Francesca. He learns Vanessa has gone into labour and hurries to the hospital, but misses the birth. When he meets his son, Vanessa reveals that she is engaged to Rhys. Lucas and Vanessa decide to name their son, Patrick (Lucas MacFarlane). They are both devastated when Patrick is diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly, which will need surgery. Vanessa learns that Lucas loves her. Patrick's oxygen levels drop and he is rushed into surgery. While Lucas is comforting Vanessa, they kiss and begin a relationship. While they stay in hospital accommodation, Lucas rents Number 32 to the Turners. 
Lucas admits to Vanessa that he is afraid to love his son in case he dies and Vanessa gets him to hold Patrick for the first time. Lucas and Vanessa have Patrick baptised and he undergoes his heart surgery. Patrick is then well enough to come home and Lucas sublet an apartment from Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Karl informs Lucas that the blood he donated for Patrick's surgery had a high white blood cell count. After undergoing further tests, Lucas is diagnosed with testicular cancer. He keeps the news from Vanessa. Steph is released from jail and returns to Erinsborough. She and Lucas catch up and Steph learns about his cancer. When Lucas learns that he will need surgery, he finally tells Vanessa. The surgery is successful and Lucas proposes to Vanessa, who accepts. Steph begins spending more time with Lucas. When he learns that Vanessa was once married, he calls off their wedding. Steph then tries to persuade him to go away with her and others raise their concerns about her intentions. Vanessa asks Lucas to cut off contact with Steph and he agrees. 
Steph takes Patrick and Vanessa blames Lucas. He finds Steph and Patrick is returned unharmed. Lucas collapses due to a complication from the cancer surgery, but Karl tells him he will be fine. Lucas purchases a Lassiter's apartment, despite Vanessa's concerns about the price. They are then forced to sell Number 32 and Lucas worries about his financial situation. He and Vanessa are both surprised to learn that they are expecting another baby. When his financial situation becomes worse, Lucas begins gambling again and gets into debt with Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko). When Vanessa has a scare with the baby, Lucas goes back to Robbo and loses more money. Robbo later dies as a result of a hit and run. When Matt Turner (Josef Brown) realises that Lucas's signature was on a note found on Robbo and that he has a large amount of cash, he is brought in for questioning. Lucas explains to the detective that a stranger told him Robbo was using marked cards, so he confronted him. The stranger intervened and later returned Lucas's money to him. Lucas tells Vanessa about his gambling. He also tries to apologise to Toadie and Sonya, but they struggle to forgive him for not coming forward sooner. A picture of the stranger, with the name "Marty" written on the back, is put under Lucas's door and he gives it to the police. Vanessa's ex-husband arrives in town and reveals that he and Vanessa are still married. He later offers Vanessa and Lucas $100,000, which they accept. With their financial problems eased, Lucas decides not to sell Number 32. He and Vanessa then exchange vows in a commitment ceremony. When they return home from their honeymoon in Daylesford, Lucas and Vanessa receive offers for their Lassiter's apartment and the garage. After contemplating a move to the countryside, they decide to go for it and they leave Erinsborough.
Reception.
For his portrayal of Lucas, Major was nominated in the Best Bad Boy category at the 2009 All About Soap Awards. In 2013, he received a nomination for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. A writer for Holy Soap stated Lucas' most memorable moment was when he felt responsible for Bridget Parker's death after Johnno Brewer sabotaged the Parkers' car. They said "It led to a guilt-stricken Lucas trying to flee Ramsay Street". Of Lucas, Jaci Stephen of the "Daily Mail" said "Not only is he addicted to gambling, he is pathologically attached to his biking jacket, even when everyone around him is in boxer shorts and vests. Maybe he lost his undies in a poker game?" A year later, Stephen commented on his jacket again, saying he must be cemented into it; because he has worn it "ever since he first arrived in Erinsborough". Stephen later insulted Lucas' storyline with Steph, in which he starts physio to be a "real man" for her. She said "Trust me, Lucas. Given the girl's history, she'd probably be happy with a goldfish for company."
A "Daily Record" reporter observed that Lucas' relationship with Elle was becoming more epic than ""Doctor Zhivago", "Romeo and Juliet" or "The Thorn Birds". They branded it a silly storyline because they were "clearly mad for each other" but "too stubborn to let each other know it." After Lucas discovers Dan has given Sam his savings, a writer for the publication said "Even Lucas, who's hardly a moral compass you could steer by, is disgusted by his brother's actions." Of the character's reaction to receiving a large inheritance, a writer for the paper said "It's hard to find any sympathy with Lucas at the minute - he's suddenly rolling in money, but he'd rather not have it. Get a grip man!" In July 2011, Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton revealed that he had seen some comments from people thinking that Lucas and Chris should be paired up. Langford believed that there was not a hint of romance between the two characters and stated that he liked Chris and Lucas's mentor and mentee relationship as it is.
Cameron Adams of the "Herald Sun" said Lucas went to "some rather extreme lengths" to win over Emilia when he posed naked with a toolbox for her. A columnist for "All About Soap" said that Lucas showing Emilia his "birthday suit" was a "bonkers plan". They called him desperate and said he had gone to "extreme lengths". They added that he could not convince them that he is laid-back with a naked display and quipped that Emilia is a "lucky (ahem) lady." Claire Crick from the same publication commented on Lucas' baby drama, saying "Here at "All About Soap", we'd love to see him be a dad (and get a hair cut – but that's a whole other matter entirely!) – you never know, he and Vanessa could even make a go of things and be a family!" Crick's colleague Kerry Barrett wrote "Lucas is a loser, right? Only cares about fast cars and faster women? Not any more. Vanessa's changed him." Barrett added that due to Vanessa's presence Lucas had decided to "grow up and concentrate on being a dad!" Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, branded Lucas "one of the nicest neighbours but one who should never gamble with anything other than buttons."

MC Flasher

MC Flasher is the Electronic music persona of Slovenian-Canadian performance artist Simon Pribac.
As a longtime resident and art director of Slovenia's most famed club Ambasada Gavioli, MC FLASHER has been the developer of new wave techno MC-ing and the creator of Ambasada's ideological structure in years 1998 to 2005. He has also been seen as the man, who reinvented the way of vocalizing the Techno music in Central European Electronic music scene of the late 1990-s.
History.
Flasher began performing as the front man in progressive punk rock band Pudding Fields in 1993 and as an actor in various theatres in Slovenia and Northern Italy.
He received his first voice/speech training at the national Slovenian radio and television broadcasting company (RTV Slovenia). Later he produced and hosted a number of alternative music radio shows on different Slovenian radio stations.
In 1998 he began to develop the project of techno/house vocal animation under supervision of Ambasada Gavioli as producer and Valentino Kanzyani as the art director, which proved to be one of the most defined and sophisticated projects of its kind in the electronic music scene at the time. As a techno MC he created a fusion of different approaches, techniques and skills he developed through his theatre, music, radio and television work and later took charge of Ambasada Gavioli's art direction and outreach sector.
Performance Techniques.
His understanding of vocal performance is based on stories and themes. Flasher deconstructs the elements and meanings of the theme and assembles them into a greater vocal super-structure that is projected into the music-ambiance-public during the event. His techno style is described as "atmospheric flashing of mind" and the vocalizing is producing a "sound picture", which ultimately affects the receiver's state of mind.
Some of his performance works have also included elements of street theatre, Neoism, teachings of Antonin Artaud and Michael Chekhov and adhering to the official ideology of Ambasada Gavioli: Commedia dell'Arte since Ambasada Gavioli has originally been designated to host an ongoing "Commedia dell'Arte of the 21st Century".
Development.
During his techno career he collaborated and performed with artists from Sony Japan (Takkyū Ishino), Cocoon Germany(Sven Vaeth, Toni Rios, Joerg Henze,…), Claude Young, Novamute UK (Luke Slater, Space DJz,…), Dee Lite, New York USA (Supa DJ Dmitry), Ovum Recordings USA (Josh Wink), Black Nation USA (Jay Denham), Recycled Loops Slovenia (Umek), Tortured Records UK (Billy Nasty, Craig Walsh,…), …
Beside years of residency in Slovenia’s most famed techno venue Ambasada Gavioli, one of his most important public appearances included performances at Cocoon’s Morph to Extreme series in Amnesia, Ibiza (Spain) in cooperation with Sven Vaeth.
He is the organizer and the artistic director of annual Music and Art festival “THE FINAL FLASH”, which takes place in the Seaside region of Slovenia, introducing new approaches in sound, performing arts and fashion while showcasing emerging world’s electronic music talent. A number of international artists from over 15 different countries on 5 continents have contributed their works to this international project.
Other projects.
Flasher’s other projects include international SYLD (Support Your Local DJ) series in Slovenia, United Kingdom and South Africa, performance art projects collaboration with artists such as Istvan Kantor, DJ Psiho, Dahlia Steinberg, Aviva Zimmerman, Noel Cillavak, Valentino Kanzyani, F Sonik as well as various film and media projects, such as main role in the feature action drama Exit, planned to be launched in 2008.
International resonance.
The projects initiated and developed by MC Flasher attracted the attention of institutions such as the Israeli Ministry of Culture, Sport and Education, York University in Toronto, Canada, MTV Networks Europe, which led to collaboration of the Final Flash team on various international conferences and a global video animation contest in collaboration with MTV.

<doc id="19039448" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19039448" title="Chuang Guandong">
Chuang Guandong

Chuang Guandong (, literally "Crashing into Guandong" with "Guandong" being an older name for Manchuria), is descriptive of the rush into Manchuria of the Han Chinese population, especially from the Shandong Peninsula and Zhili, during the hundred year period starting at the last half of the 19th century. Previously, this region was outside China proper, but was sometimes under direct control and/or indirect influence, of the ruling Chinese dynasty. During the first two centuries of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, this part of China, the traditional homeland of the ruling Manchus, was, with few exceptions, closed to settlement by Han Chinese. The region, now known as Northeast China, has an overwhelmingly Han population.
Historical background.
Inner Manchuria, also called Guandong (literally, "east of the pass" referring to Shanhai Pass at the eastern end of the Great Wall of China) or "Guānwài" (關外; "outside of the pass"), used to be a land of sparse population, inhabited mainly by the Tungusic peoples. In 1668 during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, the Qing government further decreed a prohibition of other people getting into this area of their origin. 
The sparse population of the Qing Empire's northeastern borderlands facilitated the annexation of the so-called "Outer Manchuria" (the regions north of the Amur and east of the Ussuri) by the Russian Empire, finalized by the Treaty of Aigun (1858), and the Convention of Peking (1860). In response, the Qing officials such as Tepuqin (特普欽), the Military Governor ("jiangjun") of Heilongjiang in 1859-1867, made proposals (1860) to open parts of Guandong for Chinese farmer settlers in order to oppose the conquest of Russia. The Qing government subsequently changed its policy, encouraging poor farmers from the nearby Zhili Province (the present-day Hebei) and Shandong to move to and live in Manchuria, where one district after another became officially opened for settlement.
The exact numbers of migrants can't be counted, because of the variety of ways of travel (some simply walked), and the underdeveloped government statistics apparatus. Nonetheless, based on the reports of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service and, later, the South Manchurian Railway, modern historians Thomas Gottschang and Diana Lary estimate that, during the period 1891-1942, some 25.4 million migrants arrived to Manchuria from China south of the Great Wall, and 16.7 million went back. This gives the total positive migration balance of 8.7 million people over this half a century period. This makes the scale of the migration comparable to the westward expansion in United States, the advance to Siberia in Russia or, on a smaller scale, the move to Hokkaido in Japan.
Present-day significance.
Those who moved to Manchuria were poor farmers mainly from Shandong who traveled through the land of Shanhai Pass or by sea, using the Yantai-Lushun ferry that was in service due to the Beiyang Fleet who were stationed in Weihaiwei in Shandong Peninsula and Lushun in Liaodong Peninsula. Because of this movement, the majority of older people in Dalian City are from Shandong and the Dalian Dialect is part of the Jiaoliao Mandarin, the Chinese dialect group spreading from Qingdao to Dalian and Dandong.
In the present-day China, the "Chuang Guandong" migration is well researched.
In popular arts and literature.
A television drama series, "Chuang Guandong", made by Dalian TV Station, using the scenarios written by Gao Mantang, was broadcast in Dalian, China, in January and February, 2008, and was later broadcast throughout China by China Central Television.

<doc id="19039536" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19039536" title="Harold Lloyd Estate">
Harold Lloyd Estate

The Harold Lloyd Estate, also known as Greenacres, is a large mansion and landscaped estate located in the Benedict Canyon section of Beverly Hills, California. Built in the late 1920s by silent film star Harold Lloyd, it remained Lloyd's home until his death in 1971. The estate originally consisted of a 44-room mansion, golf course, outbuildings, and canoe run on . Greenacres has been called "the most impressive movie star's estate ever created." After Lloyd died, the estate was subdivided into multiple lots, though the mansion remains and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.
Architecture and construction.
In 1923, Lloyd purchased a historic home site from P.E. Benedict at the mouth of Benedict Canyon in Beverly Hills, California. The land had been owned by the Benedict family for more than sixty years and was close to the spot where Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks had built their famed Pickfair estate.
In 1925, Lloyd hired architect Sumner Spaulding of the firm Webber, Staunton & Spaulding, after an introduction by landscape architect A.E. Hanson, to design a house on the property. Lloyd also hired Hanson to landscape the grounds.
The final plans for the house were not completed until July 1927, at which time the "Los Angeles Times" published the architectural drawing. The home was designed in the Italian Renaissance Mediterranean Revival style: modeled after the Villa Palmieri near Florence. Construction of the mansion began in July 1927 and was completed in 1928.
The 44-room, house and estate was said to have cost $2 million.
Landscape architecture - gardens.
A.E. Hanson, Lloyd's landscape architect, transformed the site with the Villa Lante and Villa Medici as inspiration in Mediterranean Revival and Spanish Revival style motifs. The "Los Angeles Times" published a full-page illustrated article describing it as a "gorgeous fairyland playground" and a "Modern Eden of groves and gardens." The elaborated design of the grounds' landscape and gardens included the following elements:
So massive was the landscaping project that 3,500 tons of sandstone were taken from quarries in Chatsworth and trucked to the site for use in building the steps, terraces, and waterfalls. 
One of the unusual features was the separate fairyland estate that Lloyd and A.E. Hanson designed for Lloyd's four-year-old daughter, Mildred Gloria. The play village had its own private gate with a sign reading, "Come into my garden and play." The fairyland estate included a four-room miniature old English house, a miniature old English stable with a pony and cart, Great Dane dogs, a wishing well with water for the daughter's garden, a slide, acrobatic devices and a swing. The miniature house had electricity and a kitchen and bath with running water, where the Lloyds' daughter played with friends, including Shirley Temple.
History during Lloyd's lifetime.
Lloyd named his estate "Greenacres," and it became a gathering place for the Lloyds' family and friends. Sundays were known as "at home" day at Greenacres:"The 'at home' day at Greenacres was Sunday when 30 or 40 friends would gather in the afternoon, amuse themselves with golf, tennis or handball, swimming, or with leisurely strolls through the gardens. A buffet would be set in the formal dining room and in the evening Lloyd would show a movie. Then he would wave everyone goodnight."
In 1937, Mrs. Lloyd hosted a bridal shower at the estate for Jeanette MacDonald attended by Hollywood's elite, including Ginger Rogers, Mary Pickford, Irene Dunne, Fay Wray, Norma Shearer, Dolores del Río, Loretta Young, Irving Thalberg, Mervyn LeRoy, Ernst Lubitsch, Hal Roach and Darryl Zanuck. 
By the 1940s, Lloyd's movie career was at an end, and he had difficulty affording the upkeep of the enormous estate. He petitioned the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 1943 to reduce his property assessment, claiming he would like to continue living there, but the high taxes were "eating them out of house and home." The Board refused to reduce the $58,730 assessed valuation of the of land, but did reduce the $119,840 valuation of the improvements to $100,000. Lloyd was forced to reduce the staff working at the estate, and parts of the estate began to deteriorate out of neglect.
One of the two film vaults on the estate, located safely away from the main house, caught fire in 1943 and destroyed many of Lloyd's valuable negatives and prints. According to his granddaughter Suzanne, Lloyd rescued as much material as he could from the vault before it became engulfed in flames.
In his later years, Lloyd lived a private life at his estate, jogging around the estate each day following a swim in the pool. He was also said to have developed an "addiction to stereo that shook the mansion at 3 a.m. with the force of 10 speakers in unison," causing the gold leaf to fall from the ornate living room ceiling.
Lloyd lived at the estate until he died of cancer in 1971, at age 77. One of Lloyd's longtime staff reported that he had a superstition about never allowing himself to be driven around the Italian fountain in the estate's front court, always making his chauffeur back up rather than circling the fountain. According to the longtime worker, "The only time he ever went around that fountain was the night he died."
History after Lloyd's death.
Plans for preservation and a museum.
Lloyd left his Benedict Canyon estate to the "benefit of the public at large" with instructions that it be used "as an educational facility and museum for research into the history of the motion picture in the United States." For a few years the home was open to public tours, but financial and legal obstacles prevented the estate from creating the motion picture museum that Lloyd had intended. Among other things, neighboring homeowners in the wealthy community were opposed to the creation of a museum hosting parties and attracting busloads of tourists.
In October 1972, the "Los Angeles Times" visited the property and noted that it had "the feel of "Sunset Boulevard"," bringing to mind the line spoken by the young writer when he first visits Norma Desmond's home: "It was the kind of place that crazy movie people built in the crazy 20s." The house appeared to visitors in the 1970s to be frozen in time at 1929. One writer noted that nothing had been moved or replaced, changed, or modernized, from the books in the library to the appliances in the kitchen and the fixtures in the bathrooms. Noted columnist Jack Smith visited the estate in 1973 and wrote that "time stood still", as Lloyd's clothes still hung in his closet, and the master bedroom and living room "looked like a set for a movie of the 1930s." A Renaissance tapestry presented to Lloyd as a housewarming gift by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks was still hanging in the hallway. 
The house also had Lloyd's permanent Christmas tree loaded with ornaments at the end of a long sitting room. Jack Smith described the tree as follows:"t the end of the room, dominating it like some great Athena in a Greek temple, stood the most fantastic Christmas tree I had ever seen. It reached the ceiling, a great, bulbous mass of colored glass baubles, some of them as big as pumpkins, clustered together like gaudy jewels in some monstrous piece of costume jewelry."
Sale and subdivision of the estate.
With the inability to establish the museum, the estate was sold at auction in 1975. The entire property, including grounds and furnishings, was purchased by a retired Iranian businessman, Nasrollah Afshani, for $1.6 million -- $400,000 less than Lloyd had spent to build the estate 50 years earlier. Afshani subdivided the estate into approximately 15 lots in addition to the mansion, with individual lots selling for as much as $1.2 million. 
The mansion was preserved on a smaller parcel and sold for $3 million in 1979 to Bernard C. Solomon, the president of Everest Record Group. In 1986, Ted Field, heir to the Marshall Field department store chain and head of Interscope Films, bought the property for $6.5 million and lived there with his wife Susie and their three children. The Fields extensively updated and renovated the entire home and grounds and added a pool back to the site. (The original pool located down closer to Benedict Canyon had been lost in the 1975 subdividing of the property.) Restoring everything except the original theater-size forty-rank pipe organ (which remains today behind the walls of the living room), the Field family replaced all the electrical wiring and plumbing and modernized the kitchens and bathrooms before moving into the estate. Susie also added an 80-year-old carousel with hand-carved horses to the children's play yard and the same security system used at the White House. Field hosted a gala political fundraiser for Bill Clinton and Al Gore at the estate in 1992 where Barbra Streisand performed a concert in the formal garden. In 1993, billionaire and Democratic Party fundraiser Ron Burkle bought the home for $20 million -- $19 million less than the $39 million asking price (which had included a valuable art collection of old masters paintings in the original asking price) but still among the highest prices paid for a home in the United States in the previous three years. On May 20, 1994, the estate hosted yet another gala fundraiser attended by President Clinton at which R&B singer Natalie Cole performed.
In 2001, the mansion was estimated to be worth $50–60 million.
The main house and the estate's principal gardens are frequently used for civic fundraising events and as a filming location, appearing in films such as in "The Godfather", "Westworld" and "The Loved One".

Tony Morgano

Tony Morgano (August 19, 1913-February 2, 1984) was a dynamic left-handed professional boxer fighting out of South Philadelphia in the 1930s. He defeated five world champions in non title fights including Freddie Miller, Baby Arizmendi, Tommy Paul, Lew Feldman, and Johnny Jadick. After his retirement from professional boxing he worked as an iron worker, and later served as a GOP committeeman in the Ninth Division of the 26th Ward of Philadelphia. Throughout his life he tirelessly gave back to the community, training approximately 1,250 young boxers, providing for retired fighters, and working with various charitable organizations throughout Philadelphia.
Early years.
Morgano was an Italian-American boxer, born and raised in Philadelphia on Montrose Street, to Paul and Concetta Morgano. Tony had four brothers - Robert, Paul, Sam, and Edward and two sisters - Anne and Grace. His father Paul was an immigrant painter who died when he was five. As a result of this Tony was forced to grow up rather quickly. He finished the third grade and having spent a lot of time watching fighters train at the Olympic gym at Broad and Bainbridge streets, he started his boxing career - at the age of 12.
Amateur career.
Morgano went undefeated as an amateur defeating 22 fighters. He weighed 88 pounds at the age of twelve, when he fought and won the Middle Atlantic AAU flyweight title. Fighters were not allowed to weigh under 100 pounds by rule so he filled his shoes with lead and tipped the scales at 105 pounds. In the next three years he won 21 fights.
In order to help his mother support his family, after winning a bout, he would be awarded "a Walton watch, and somebody at ringside would buy it from you for $2 or $3 dollars . I'd sell the watch and take the money home to Mom for food. I was boxing every night. It helped out."
Professional career.
Philadelphia, at this time, was a lightweight hotbed that included Cool, Massey, Willis, Tony Falco, Johnny Jadick, Tony Morgano, Georgie Gibbs, Young Firpo, and Benny Bass, that provided the city’s boxing fans with an exciting local round-robin of cross-town rivalries and neighborhood feuds, as all of the above faced each other in hectic matches. Morgano finished his career with victories over both Cool, Gibbs, and Jadick.
Tony's professional career started almost by accident. A Camden promoter offered him $25 to be a stand-in against Pee Wee Ross, an experienced fighter. He took the fight on January 15, 1929, and in his own words "punch the stuffing out of Ross" He kept 5 dollars and gave 20 to his mother to help pay for food. Telegraphs revealed that much of his prize money in later fights would be sent back to his mother to help provide for his siblings. When it became known that he had fought for pay his amateur days were done. At 15, he found himself under contract to Max "Boo Boo" Hoff a local promoter. Prior to going with Hoff, Morgano was managed by Vincent "Jimmy" Barbieri (1907-2011), who at the age of 102 told stories of "his boy" Tony.
He boxed in the Philadelphia area until the age of 21, accumulating approximately 51 victories. He then teamed up with Frankie Caris, a middleweight, and traveled the nation boxing. They landed in California and Morgano became a star, entertaining and working with many Hollywood types. He rapidly defeated Georgie Hansford, Tommy Paul (ex featherweight champion) and Lew Feldman taking 9 out of 10 rounds on April 5, 1935. His only blemish during this stint came against Jimmy Christy which was considered an upset, they drew in a rematch.
During his time in California in 1935 he participated in musicals such as Golddiggers of Broadway with Dick Powell and Joan Blondell, a film with Mae West, and then another cowboy movie.
Upon his return to Philadelphia, in a period of four years he strung together at least 13 victories, with a loss to Billy Maher. It was well documented at the time that Morgano entered the bout with two broken ribs and a fractured ankle. Following this loss he defeated Tommy Speigal on September 27, 1940 for lightweight title however Morgano came in overweight and was not award the title as a result. Morgano retired in 1940 after a shattered hand.
Morgano finished his career with 55 victories, 11 defeats and at 25 kos.
After Boxing.
During World War II he worked as a welder at the old New York Shipyard in Camden. After the war he became an ironworker and worked on several major projects. He soon married a young woman by the name of Patrica and had three sons, Kevin, Tony and Michael.
He became active in Republican Party politics serving as a GOP committeeman in the Ninth Division of the 26th Ward and ran for City Council and for state legislature.
Morgano gave much back to the community of South Philadelphia, working in his spare time with young boxers at the Police Athletic League and the Southside Boys club. Ge trained some 1,250 boxers over 30 years. His Southside Boys club competed for and won on several occasions the Pennsylvania Golden Gloves tournament.
Morgano served as longtime president of the Veteran's Boxing Association, and worked hard to better the lives of many ex boxers. Often staging events to support them.
Professional Record.
Below represents a partial list of Morgano's professional bouts. Due to the incomplete record keeping of the time the list is unfinished and will be updated as more information becomes available.

Pampered Menial

Pampered Menial is an album released in 1975 by progressive rock/AOR band, Pavlov's Dog. 
The album features the band's original line-up, comprising David Surkamp (vocals and guitar), Steve Scorfina (lead guitar), Mike Safron (drums), Rick Stockton (bass guitar), David Hamilton (keyboard), Doug Rayburn (mellotron and flute), and Siegfried Carver (born Richard Nadler) (various string instruments including the rare Vitar, a cross between a guitar and a violin). Carver left the band soon after the album was released. It was first released on ABC Records,debuting on the charts in early April. The LP was soon reissued by Columbia Records, whose version (with slightly different cover) entered the charts in mid-June, just after the ABC issue had dropped off the charts. Having both versions on sale in stores at nearly the same time may have confused buyers.
In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition "Pink Floyd & the Story of Prog Rock", the album came #26 in its list of "40 Cosmic Rock Albums".

Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes

Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes (; July 27, 1777 – May 17, 1834) was a German physicist, meteorologist, and astronomer.
Brandes was born in 1777 in Groden near Ritzebüttel (a former exclave of the Free Imperial City of Hamburg, today in Cuxhaven), the third son of Albert Georg Brandes, a preacher. He studied at the University of Göttingen from 1796 to 1798 under Abraham Gotthelf Kästner and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. Carl Friedrich Gauss was a fellow student. He attained his doctorate in 1800, and spent a short time teaching privately. As an astronomer, he was noted for demonstrating that meteors occur in the upper atmosphere and thus not really a meteorological phenomena.
From 1801 to 1811 he was at first a technical designer of dykes on the Weser river at Eckwarden, Butjadingen, in the Duchy of Oldenburg, and later a dyke inspector for the lower right bank of the Weser.
In 1811 he became a professor of mathematics at the newly created University of Breslau, a merger of two Wrocław colleges. In 1826 he gained the chair of physics at the University of Leipzig.
He had a very wide range of activities. He wrote a considerable number of mathematics textbooks. In 1820 he published the first weather charts in "Beiträgen zur Witterungskunde" ("Contributions to Meteorology"). Thus he is considered to be a founder of synoptic meteorology. In 1824 he developed a new method to compute the Euler constant numerically. He died on May 17, 1834, in Leipzig, and was buried in the Alter Johannisfriedhof.

85 Ceti

85 Ceti is an older Flamsteed designation for a star that is now within the borders of the northern constellation of Aries, the ram. In the present day it is known by star catalogue designations such as "HD 16861" and "HR 797". It has an apparent visual magnitude of 6.30 and is approximately distant from the Earth. This is an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A2 V. It has 2.4 times the mass of the Sun and shines with 48 times the Sun's luminosity. This energy is being radiated into outer space from the star's outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 8,810 K. This heat gives it the white-hued glow of an A-type star.

Kokushkin Bridge

The Kokushkin Bridge () is a bridge across the Griboedov Canal in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
History.
The bridge got its name from the merchant Vasily Kokushkin, whose house was located at the corner of Kokushkin Alley and Garden Street. From 1786 to 1796 the name was spelled "Kokushkinov Bridge" and from 1801 to 1853 the bridge was mistakenly called "Kukushkin Bridge" (meaning "Cuckoo Bridge" in Russian). Until 1872 the official name of the bridge could be written both as Kokushkin and as Kakushkin.
The first wooden bridge at that location was built in 1790. It underwent major restoration in 1872, when, the span of the bridge was replaced with an exact replica, so the bridge preserved the same appearance.
In 1946 the bridge was replaced with a new one, by engineer B.B.Levin and architect L.A.Noskov. The old supports were completely dismantled, and the new ones were set in their place. The wooden span was replaced with a steel one consisting of eight welded beams.
New cast iron railings were installed on the bridge. The abutments of the railings resemble these on the canal's embankment.
Bridge in the literature.
While the bridge is not the most famous or picturesque, it is connected with the some of the most prominent authors in the Russian literature.
In 1829, Alexander Pushkin mentioned Kokushkin bridge in a famous epigram. For the first edition of "Eugene Onegin", the poet commissioned an illustration depicting himself and Onegin walking together along the quay. Upon receiving the illustration, which represented him leaning on a parapet with his back turned towards the Peter and Paul Fortress, he was exceedingly displeased with the result (which had little in common with his own preliminary sketch, illustrated to the right) and scribbled the following epigram underneath:
Fyodor Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment" starts with a mention of the bridge:
"K. bridge" here means Kokushkin bridge.
In Mikhail Lermontov's unfinished novel "Shtoss", the main character, the artist Lugin, looks for "Shtoss House" near Kokushkin Bridge. 
It is conceivable that Lermontov took the actual "Zverkov House" as the prototype of Shtoss House. Zverkov House was a famous apartment house near Kokushkin Bridge.
In 1829, the then young and unknown Nikolai Gogol rented a room in that house, where he wrote "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka", as commemorated by a plaque on the house. Gogol liked to place the characters in his writings in real locations that he had visited. In "Diary of a Madman", Gogol sends Poprishchin over the Kokushkin Bridge to the Zverkov House.

The Great Divide (Willie Nelson album)

The Great Divide is an album released in 2002 by American country music singer Willie Nelson. It contains several duets and musical collaborations with artists such as Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty, Lee Ann Womack, Kid Rock, Sheryl Crow, Brian McKnight, and Bonnie Raitt. The album produced two chart singles in "Mendocino County Line" and "Maria (Shut Up and Kiss Me)", which respectively reached #22 and #41 on the Hot Country Songs charts. Also included is a cover of "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)", previously a hit for Kenny Rogers and the First Edition. The songs "Mendocino County Line," "Last Stand in Open Country," and "This Face" were co-written by Bernie Taupin, the lyricist best known for his collaborations with Elton John.
Reception.
The album was panned for the excessively adult contemporary production. Pat Blashill of Rolling Stone said "Nelson is a performer who uses plain, powerful lyrics and a handsome but unvarnished voice to great effect. Much of that gets lost in the adult-contemporary production goop and heavenly choirs" of this release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said it is "an accomplished, classy album, but it sure as hell isn't a Willie Nelson album." Both agreed "the best moments here are the ones in which Nelson just does his thing all by his bad self."

Journey to the West (album)

Journey to the West is the soundtrack to the stage musical "" and is composed by English musician Damon Albarn (of Blur and Gorillaz fame) with the UK Chinese Ensemble, the soundtrack itself is only based upon, but not a direct recording of the musical. The album was released as a download, CD, and double vinyl LP in the United Kingdom on 18 August 2008 by XL Recordings. In the United States, the album was released a day later as a download, while a CD was released on 23 September 2008.
Background.
Damon Albarn made a point in an interview with Gorillaz-Unofficial that the Monkey project was supposed to be "Gorillaz, really. But we can’t call it that for legal reasons". Speaking of his decision to compose music for an opera, Albarn noted that, "This is composition, not songwriting, of course, I was aprehensive at first. But people who come from my normal discipline don't tend to go far enough. We want to bring more flavour to people's lives. And demystify opera to a degree, destroy its elitist angle. Then for people who do like opera, open them up to new forms of music, too. We want to bring a big cornerstone of Chinese culture and present it to the West. If we can do that, then we've succeeded."
Chen Shi-Zheng, the man responsible for creating and conceiving the stage adaptation of "Monkey: Journey to the West", explained that he "was looking for someone young and smart to work with. I didn't want to give Damon or Jamie too specific a brief because what was important in this project was that it was their sensibility we wanted. What Damon and I did agree on straightaway was that we didn't want pastiche Chinese music and on the last trip we made he found something he could latch on to."
Chen took Albarn and Hewlett to China up to five times, Hewlett claimed that "we spent three years working on the opera, we totally immersed ourselves in Chinese culture." 18 months after starting work on the project, Albarn produced his first piece called "Heavenly Peach Banquet" which was a take on the style of music performed by female C-pop acts. Talking about the piece, Chen said that "I find it very humorous, Hong Kong pop is so pretty and naïve. This is Damon pretending to be naïve and you are laughing at him. Messy is a bad word, but he took a melody, messed it around and put noises into it, twisted and processed the sound so that none of it is as it seems."
Before writing any music, Albarn first chose to visit China several times, mainly to seek advice from musicians, "As a Western musician, I knew I'd have to find a way of dabbling in the Chinese idiom without it coming out sounding like Chopsticks. I met a lot of musicians and I also tried to capture any sound that was interesting, from traffic to elevators. There were many days when I got up at half four in the morning just to record the sound of an elevator. You put it all together and somehow something comes out."
In order to compose the music, Albarn made a habit of strictly using the Chinese pentatonic scale with the aid of a system he used consisting of five- and seven-pointed stars which he stuck to his soundboard and that he would rotate (supposedly at random) to produce unexpected combinations of notes. The decision to use this method came about after Albarn had been analysing the five-point communist star, "I was reading about Chinese music and I discovered a strong cosmic and numerical relationship to it. It's very old music, some of it dating back 2,000 years. The number five is very, very important. I was really motoring when I understood that. I visualised this star on the stage and it beginning to rotate and I started getting excited about that and 'how can I make that star rotate musically?'"
Talking about the sound that he was aiming for, Albarn stated that, "it's very much a modern piece, it's not trying to evoke the time of legend at all. It's very much in sort of downtown Beijing, Shanghai or Tokyo. It's very much the modern Asia: slightly kooky, very colourful, quite sexy, but still a quite sinister place."
Albarn's orchestra included Chinese instruments such as the pipa (sometimes called the Chinese lute) and the Ondes Martenot, which is an early electronic musical instrument invented in 1928. In addition to the large variety of instruments used, Albarn, with the help of his collaborators, managed to invent his own instrument which he named the "klaxophone", which features car-horns attached to a musical keyboard, and was purpose-built for the production by artist Gavin Turk with the intention to reproduce the sounds of China's roads.
Backing up his decision to release the production's musical score, Albarn explained that "I wanted to put the album out so that there is a record, literally, of how I think of it in my head, but the music should stand alone because none of it was composed as an accompaniment to action. I wasn't going to start making music that drives the narrative, because that's just naff; it becomes like film music or cartoon music. 'Now they're running.' You can't really work like that. I just wrote an awful lot of music and slowly kind of put it together."
The album features a track which shares its name with the national anthem of the People's Republic of China, March of the Volunteers, the piece is in fact an alternative, upbeat version of the anthem. The Japanese edition of the album features two bonus tracks, one of which is titled "Journey to Beijing" which was used by the BBC alongside Hewlett's animation as a promotional link for its Olympics coverage.
Two special editions box sets of the album were released. The "Deluxe" box set contains a 68-page booklet as well as a poster. It was originally limited to 2500 copies but has been repressed since then. The "Art" box set contains six exclusive tracks ("5 Point Star", "Living Sea Introduction", "The Dragon Queen", "Buddha's Palm", "Monk's Funeral" and "Volcano"). It was priced at £255 and was limited to 2000 copies. It also features an 80-page hardback book and four art prints (one of which was signed by Jamie Hewlett). Additionally the first 500 orders also received a special Monkey Om Box which plays pieces of music composed by Damon Albarn.
Promotion.
Two tracks were performed live on 7 October 2008 on "Later...With Jools Holland".
Reception.
Commercial performance.
"Journey to the West" entered the UK Albums Chart at #5 on release, entirely in Mandarin, it became the first album of its kind to chart in the United Kingdom. It also reached #1 on the UK Indie Chart.
Overall the album spent four weeks in the UK's Top 100 Albums, two of which were in the Top 40. The track "Monkey Bee" managed to enter the Top 200 of the UK Singles Chart - on downloads alone - at #196.
Critical response.
The album met with generally positive reviews, based on an aggregate score of 69/100 from Metacritic, who listed 0 out of the 13 available reviews as "negative". IGN gave the album an overall score of 9.5 (out of 10) and states "mixing Asian melodies with western electronic sounds is certainly nothing new, but the Monkey project is a broad collaboration with some of the most talented performers in Chinese opera, and the resulting mélange is appreciably more authentic than your average world beat record" and adds "the score ranks as the best rock opera ever written and deserves a place among the most audacious modern operas, regardless of genre. This is a brilliant and challenging composition that deserves to be celebrated." "The Times" writer Robert Sandall awarded the album 5 stars out of 5, claiming that, "Albarn has really gone the distance in trying to master the indigenous pentatonic scale without abandoning the playful spirit he brought to Gorillaz." while viewing the album as sitting "roughly equidistant between East/West fusion pop and a contemporary classical work such as Adams’s Nixon in China." URB echoed these thoughts, stating that "Monkey: Journey to the West is a testament to Albarn's versatility as a musician and his melodies' ability to avoid becoming losing their power in translation." The Guardian gave the album four stars and insisted that "You can go a fair distance without encountering a tune, which is less of a problem when there is something to look at. But even during the occasional longueurs, it's hard not to marvel at the ambition on display here, hard to think of anyone who would dare attempt something similar, and impossible to imagine someone else pulling it off with more aplomb."
However, Keith McDonnell of musicOMH, gave a rather mixed review of the record itself, rewarding it 2 stars out of 5 and viewing the release as "disappointing on every conceivable level" and states the album pales in comparison to the stage musical itself "I'd totally succumbed to its charm in the theatre, but I'd advise anyone approaching this CD to do so with caution, especially if you've not seen it in its glory in the theatre where it belongs." Online music and film webzine Tiny Mix Tapes questioned the album's appeal, commenting that, "Albarn's thirst for musical adventure is commendable, but unless you're obsessed with his every move or have been dreaming of the day a former Brit pop king fuses the sensibilities of Eastern opera and Western pop, Monkey just doesn't warrant your full attention." PopMatters writer Marc A. Price was slightly more positive, rewarding a 5/10 rating, while writing that "Other pop fans are more likely to see through the emperor's new clothes and call this for what it is: mostly weak but with a couple of monkey magic moments."
Despite Albarn's intentions for the album's music to "stand alone", Pitchfork Media pointed out that, "The project still has the feel of an accompanying piece, with titles referencing the dramatization of the Chinese story and plenty of incidental music," although it was also noted that the album "works on a satisfying level as an experimental work or as art-pop."
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave it 3½ out of 5 stars and wrote that, "Journey to the West is perhaps best experienced on-stage, as it was meant to be heard in tandem with Chen Shi-Zheng and Hewlett's visuals, but heard as its own work, it's hard not to admire, if not exactly embrace, Albarn's achievement here, as his work is not only ambitious, it is serious and understated, the work of a true composer."

4th Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment

The 4th Battalion 227th Aviation Regiment is an attack reconnaissance battalion, also known as 4-227 ARB supporting the 1st Cavalry Division. They fly the AH-64D Apache Longbow and are based at Fort Hood, Texas.
The history of the 4th Battalion can be traced back to Vietnam. It traces its history back to early 1963, where the Army began to gather helicopters into the 11th Air Assault Division to test the airmobile concept. Shortly thereafter, they were reassigned to the 1st Cavalry Division. On 1 August 1965, the 1st Cavalry Division was sent to Vietnam. Aviators participated in 14 Campaigns and received seven decorations to include the Presidential Unit Citation (2 awards), the Valorous Unit Award (3 awards), the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm (3 awards) and the Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Honor Medal, First Class during its 7 years of duty in Vietnam. The first Army aviator to win the Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War was a member of the 227th Aviation Battalion.
The 4th Battalion 227th ARB was reactivated on 15 November 2005 and assigned to the First Cavalry Division on Fort Hood, Texas. They were assigned to the 1st Air Cavalry Brigade. The "Guns Attack" battalion was deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom 06-08. The Battalion served for 15 months in Iraq. There are 6 companies inside the battalion A Co, B Co, C Co, D Co, E Co, and HHC.
History.
The 4–227th Attack Reconnaissance Battalion traces its origins to two distinct lineages: the regimental affiliation with the 227th AVN REGT and its roots as the Army’s first armed helicopter unit- the Utility Tactical Transport Company (UTT)- known simply as “First with Guns!”. Constituted on 15 July 1961, BG Joe Stilwell. Jr. led the UTT to develop attack helicopter tactics- evolutionary concepts as relevant today as they were innovative then. The UTT was re-flagged on several occasions in Viet Nam: in August 1964, as the 68th Armed Helicopter Company (AHC); in MAR 1965, as the 197th AHC; and in September 1966, as the 334th AHC- the first AHC in Viet Nam equipped with the advanced AH-1G Cobra. 
During the same period, the Battalion’s regimental roots were constituted on 1 February 1963 as Company D, 227th Aviation Battalion, an aerial weapons company assigned to the 11th Air Assault Division. On 1 July 1965, it was reorganized and re-designated as Company D, 227th Aviation Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division. The D Company “Guns” served valorously in support of 1st Cavalry Division operations, in Viet Nam, until it was inactivated on 30 August 1971. The unit was awarded two Presidential Unit Citations and two Valorous Unit Awards for its sustained actions in the A-Shau Valley, and the provinces of Pleiku Binh Thuan, and Bien Hoa, from 1966–1971. 
While the Guns of 227th inactivated, the Guns of the 334th AHC deployed to Hanau, Germany, in 1973, and were later re-flagged the 503rd Aviation Battalion. The units of the 503rd would ultimately re-flag as AH64 units in the 227th AVN REGT, sustaining the First with Guns lineage in Europe. Back at Fort Hood, D Company, 227th was re-activated on 16 July 1987, deploying with the Division to Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, in support of the Defense of Saudi Arabia and the Liberation of Kuwait. 
The Unit was again reorganized and re-designated, on 16 November 1993 as the 4th Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment at Fort Hood, TX, serving the Division proudly until its deactivation as a regular Army unit on 15 February 1997. During this Aviation Restructuring Initiative, the Army also down-sized the 2nd and 3rd (AH-64) Battalions of the 227th AVN REGT, activating the 1–501st AVN REGT (ATK) at Hanau, Germany as part of the 1st Armored Division. Following distinguished tours to Bosnia and Kosovo, the Battalion deployed on a 15 month combat tour to Operation Iraqi Freedom, in April 2003, earning the Valorous Unit Award for its actions in the Baghdad area of operations. 
In 2005, the 1–501st ATK deployed from Germany to Fort Hood to undergo the AH-64D Unit and Fielding Training Program and re-join the 1st Cavalry Division. The Guns deployed to OIF 06-08 with the First Team on 24 September 2006 and conducted sustained attack and reconnaissance operations for 15 months over Baghdad, in support of MND-B and MND-C. The unit received the "Meritorious Unit Citation" For its action in the Battle of Najaf in 2007. The unit redeployed to Texas in January 2008. The unit was then deployed again to Iraq in April 2009 and earned another Valorious Unit Award.

Marco Ferruzzi (born October 15, 1970 in San Antonio, Texas) is an American soccer coach who is currently the assistant coach of FC Dallas. He had a ten year professional career playing as a midfielder in several indoor and outdoor leagues including Major League Soccer and the USL First Division.
Youth.
In 1987, Ferruzzi played in one game for the U.S. U-16 national team at the 1987 FIFA U-16 World Championship In 1989, he entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he played on the men’s soccer team from 1989 to 1992.

In the fall of 1995, he signed with the Tampa Bay Terror of the National Professional Soccer League. He spent only one season with the Terror before signing with the Tampa Bay Cyclones of the USISL in 1996. However, there are hints that he may have played for the Cyclones in 1995 as well. In February 1997, the Tampa Bay Mutiny selected Ferruzzi in the first round (sixth overall) of the 1997 MLS Supplemental Draft. He spent the 1997 season in Tampa Bay, assisting on two goals in nineteen games. The Mutiny waived Ferruzzi on November 13, 1997.

Frances K. Conley

Frances "Fran" Krauskopf Conley (born August 12, 1940 in Palo Alto, California) is a professor of neurosurgery at Stanford University. She is the author of "Walking Out on the Boys"
(Ferrar, Straus and Giroux 1998), the story of her protest of misogyny
at the University hospital.
Conley was born in 1940 to Konrad Bates Krauskopf and Kathryn McCune Krauskopf. She was a crucial figure in the advancement of women in
American medicine.
Medical career.
In 1966 she became the first woman to pursue a surgical internship at Stanford Hospital, in 1975 she became the first female faculty member at Stanford in any surgical department, in 1977, she became the fifth woman to become a board certified neurosurgeon in the United States,
in 1982 the first woman to be granted a tenured professorship in neurosurgery at a
U.S. medical school, and in 1986, the first to have a
full professorship.
Early life.
She essentially grew up on the Stanford campus where her father was a professor of geochemistry. She decided in her early teenage years that she wanted to become a doctor even though the housewife stigma was the norm of the time.
She attended Bryn Mawr College in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. In her junior year, she returned to Stanford. She then entered medical school at Stanford in 1961. Her class consisted of twelve women and sixty men and she noticed that male and female students were treated much differently. During her time at Stanford medical school, she quickly realized her true passion, surgery. Surgery was a male dominated sub-field of medicine, but this did not stop Conley from pursuing it and she ended up finishing her M.D. degree in 1966.
She met her future husband, Phil Conley, during her time at Stanford.
Stanford University.
In June 1991 she publicly resigned in protest over the work environment that included sexist attitudes and outright sexual
harassment that culminated in the appointment of Dr. Gerald Silverberg as acting chair of the department of neurosurgery despite accusations
against him of sexual harassment by two clerical staff. Several months later, after promises of changes in University procedures and policies 
on sexism, she rescinded her resignation in an effort to ensure the changes might actually be implemented.
Her book "Walking Out on the Boys" spotlit misogyny at one of the nation's leading universities and led to changes in programming
throughout the country.
She was also chair of the Stanford University Academic Council in 1997/1998 and is now retired. In her later,
executive, appointments she worked to enact the reforms that had long been asserted to be unnecessary, already achieved, or imminent.
"Walking Out on the Boys".
When Conley resigned from Stanford University, her book "Walking Out on the Boys" was released and provided a very in depth and firsthand look at the sexism that really went on at the university. Conley also boldly uses the real names of the biggest perpetrators. This book offers some behind-the-scenes views of the medical school located at Stanford including certain labs and research. Her resignation and the release of this book not only created some public towards her, but also towards other instances of sexism across the country that not only occur in medical schools of universities but throughout hospitals and research environments as well.
Private Life.
In 1971, Conley was the first official women's winner of the Bay to Breakers 12K footrace with a time of 50:45. Her husband was also an athlete, representing the United States in track and field at the 1956 Olympics.

Henry Chadwick (Seattle)

Henry Alexander Chadwick (June 6, 1866 – June 1934) was an American journalist; from 1894 until his death, he was the editor, owner and publisher of "The Argus", a weekly newspaper in Seattle, Washington.
Chadwick was born in Searsport, Maine, and educated in nearby Gardiner and Farmingdale. While still in his mid-teens he began work as a printer for the Gardiner, Maine "Home Journal". At the age of 17 he became state editor of "The Daily Kennebec Journal" of Augusta, Maine. His career took him briefly to Chicago, Los Angeles and then in 1888 to Seattle, where he arrived November 6, 1888 and promptly became a printer at the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer".
A year after arriving in Seattle, Chadwick married Laura M. Castle, originally of Washington, D.C. He became a reporter and assistant city editor at the "Seattle Press" and then foreman of the composing room at the "Seattle Press-Times" (which later became the "Seattle Times").
In 1894 he resigned from the "Press-Times" to take on a half interest in the "Argus", which A. T. Ambrose had founded six weeks earlier. From the time of Ambrose's death in 1900, he was the sole proprietor of the "Argus" as well as the editor. He continued to write almost up to the moment of his death: the morning after he died while on vacation on the Olympic Peninsula, two envelopes arrived at the "Argus" offices containing a travelogue of his last journey.
He was succeeded as owner and managing editor of "The Argus" by his son Harold D. Chadwick. He also had another son, Leslie.

Jamie White (footballer)

Jamie Andrew White (born 17 November 1989) is an English professional footballer, currently playing for Salisbury City.
Playing career.
Born in Southampton, White attended Woodlands Community College, having joined the Southampton F.C. Academy as an eight year old. He began to play regularly for the Club’s youth setup in 2005 after a brief spell at Chelsea.
White featured in the FA Youth Cup semi-final in 2005–06, as well as the Academy League play-offs where he scored the opener after coming off the bench against Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final to set Saints on their way to the Championship.
He was the winner of the 2006–07 Academy Player of the Year award, but had to accept his prize on crutches, after suffering a cruciate injury whilst training with the first team in March 2007. Despite his injury, White was still able to claim that season’s top scorer prize for the Under 18s side and made a full recovery in 2007–08.
Following a strong pre-season, White was named on the bench for the League Cup tie against Exeter City, and went on to make his first team debut against Derby County on 23 August 2008.
On 14 November 2008, he joined Shrewsbury Town on loan for a month, later extended for a second month. It was while at Shrewsbury, White scored his first senior goal in the 2–1 home win against Dagenham & Redbridge.
Unfortunately, after returning from his loan spell, White broke his leg and dislocated his ankle as the result of a mistimed tackle in a reserve game against Aldershot Town.
White joined non league side Eastleigh on 9 October 2009 on a month long loan deal from Southampton. He was released by Southampton on 15 May 2010 and signed for Eastleigh on 21 December 2010 on a non contract basis.
In January 2011, he signed a short term contract with local club Totton & Eling.
Later on in 2011, White signed for Queensland State League side Whitsunday Miners. He played 36 matches and scored 9 goals.
For the 2011–2012 season he signed with Wessex Premier side Winchester City, he ended up one goal short of equaling the record number of goals in the Wessex League in a season as Winchester won the division.
Salisbury City.
Following his successful season with Winchester City where he netted 51 goals in 32 league appearances, he moved to Salisbury City, who at the time were playing 3 leagues above Winchester City. Salisbury had been trying to sign Jamie for about 5 or 6 months before they eventually got hold of him. The big difference between leagues didn't seem to prevent Jamie from playing at his best as he featured in almost all of Salisbury's league matches, and scored 26 goals for them in the league. This included a spectacular volley in Salisbury's play-off final victory against Dover Athletic from just outside the box. He jointly won the golden boot for that season. Jamie later signed a 2 year contract with Salisbury, keeping him with the club until the end of the 2014–15 season. In the pre-season period before the 2013–14 campaign, Jamie only appeared in one of the fixtures as he required an operation on a hernia. This meant that he would be out for about 6 weeks and would miss the start of the new season. It took longer than expected to get back to match fitness for Jamie, but he eventually made a couple of appearances as a substitute. Unfortunately, Jamie became injured again and so had to take further time out.

Tim Newsham is a computer security professional. He has been contributing to the security community for more than a decade. He has performed research while working at security companies including @stake, Guardent, ISS, and Network Associates (originally Secure Networks). Mr. Newsham is best known for co-authoring the paper Insertion, Evasion and Denial of Service: Eluding Network Intrusion Detection with Thomas Ptacek, a paper that broke every Network Intrusion Detection product on the market and has been cited by more than 150 academic works on Network Intrusion Detection since.
He has published other prominent white papers:
In addition to his research, Mr. Newsham is also known for his pioneering work on security products, including:
WEP Security.
He partially discovered the Newsham 21-bit WEP attack. The Newsham 21-bit attack is a method used primarily by KisMAC to brute force WEP keys. It is effective on routers such as Linksys, Netgear, Belkin, and D-Link but does not affect Apple or 3Com, as they use their own algorithms for generating WEP keys. Using this method allows for the WEP key to be retrieved in less than a minute. 
When the WEP keys are generated, they use a text based key that is generated using a 21-bit algorithm instead of the more secure 40-bit encryption algorithm, however the router presents the key to the user as a 40-bit key. This method is 2^19 times faster to brute force than a 40-bit key would be, allowing modern processors to break the encryption rapidly.
More information on the Newsham 21-bit attack can be found at kismac-ng.org and projects.cerias.purdue.edu/secprog/class3/7.Wireless.pdf
In 2008, Newsham was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Pwnie award.

XR-3 Hybrid

The XR-3 Hybrid is a plug-in hybrid kit vehicle from Robert Q. Riley Enterprises.
The top speed is and fuel economy is on diesel power only and on combined diesel and electric power.
The vehicle body is FRP/foam composite.
The vehicle is built from plans, with parts sourced by the builder, although a kit with pre-assembled parts may be sold sometime in the future.
Powertrain and range.
The two front wheels are powered by the diesel or biodiesel internal combustion engine (ICE) and the single rear wheel is electric powered. The two power systems are ground-connected, meaning that they both drive wheels along the ground but are not connected at all within the vehicle, which allows owners to add and remove the diesel and electric propulsion systems separately and use either or both. With only a diesel engine and the vehicle's standard tank holding , range is , and with only a motor and full battery packs, range is .
Price.
A duplicate of the Lithium-ion battery powered prototype will top $25,000, including $7,500 for batteries and an advanced DC motor. Lead-acid batteries trim cost between $1,500 and $2,000. However, a diesel-only vehicle can be built for less than $10,000, and the modularity of the design allows an electric power train to be added easily later.
Safety.
The vehicle has a roll bar, seat belts, foam in the sides and front of the vehicle ranging from , and a horizontal steering column intended to be pushed away by a driver thrown forward by an accident without harming the driver, unlike a conventional car's steering column. It does not have airbags, large steel beam crumple zones, or an anti-lock braking system.

It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City

"It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City" is a song written and performed by Bruce Springsteen on his debut album "Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J." in 1973. A 1975 live version can be found on the DVD of the Hammersmith Odeon concert that is included in the "Born to Run" (30th Anniversary Edition) and the "Hammersmith Odeon London '75" CDs. A 1978 live version is included in the "Live/1975–85" set. The song has also been covered by David Bowie. John Sayles included this song in a high school lunchroom scene of his movie "Baby It's You".
This is the song that impressed producer Mike Appel so much that he quit his job to become Springsteen's manager, even though Springsteen did not have a record contract yet. This was also the first song Springsteen played at his audition for John Hammond at CBS Records, who eventually signed him to a record contract, on May 2, 1972. The following day, Springsteen recorded "It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City" as part of a 12-song demo for Hammond. The demo version of the song was released on "Tracks" in 1998. The version included on "Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J." was recorded during the summer of 1972 backed by future E-Street Band members David Sancious on piano, Vini Lopez on drums and Garry Tallent on bass.
Lyrics and music.
"It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City" is a fast-paced song. It is a solid rock 'n' roll song when played in concert. Its tone is cocky and arrogant. The lyrics contain an element of religious allegory as the singer boasts of his streetwise toughness. The song is about a young man growing up on the streets of a city, and who is trying to stay "good" and do what he believes is right. Unfortunately, "those gasoline boys sure talk gritty" and he is inexorably dragged into some very unsaintly activities. One of the more quoted lines is "The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street/Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat/I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat/It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street."

Anti-nuclear movement in the Philippines

The anti-nuclear movement in the Philippines aimed to stop the construction of nuclear power facilities and terminate the presence of American military bases, which were believed to house nuclear weapons on Philippine soil. Anti-nuclear demonstrations were led by groups such as the "Nuclear-Free Philippines Coalition" and "No Nukes Philippines". A focal point for protests in the late 1970s and 1980s was the proposed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, which was built but never operated. The project was criticised for being a potential threat to public health, especially since the plant was located in an earthquake zone.
The demand of the anti-nuclear movement for the removal of military bases culminated in a 1991 Philippine Senate decision to stop extending the tenure of US facilities in the Philippines. Tons of toxic wastes were left behind after the US withdrawal and anti-nuclear and other groups worked to provide assistance for the bases' cleanup.

Real-time multimedia over ATM

In the words of Pazos, Kotelba and Malis, "ATM is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the core of service provider networks" for multimedia communication, whereas IP remains popular for multimedia communications within an organizational LAN. The QoS guarantees of ATM surpass the best-effort guarantee offered by Internet Protocol. Pazos et al. note that RMOA was developed by the ATM Forum as "an efficient and scalable means to transport native H.323 VoIP traffic over ATM that is not possible with the existing IP over ATM solutions." The RMOA working group has "defined a new type of gateway called H.323-H323 Gateway", according to the trio.
Real time high quality linear audio over ATM has been standardized by the AES and this is known as AES47 that has been used by contractors providing the wide area broadcast contribution and distribution links between production centers for the BBC in the UK.

Lithium–sulfur battery

The lithium–sulfur battery (Li–S battery) is a rechargeable battery, notable for its high energy density. By virtue of the low atomic weight of lithium and moderate weight of sulfur, Li–S batteries are relatively light; about the density of water. They were demonstrated on the longest and highest-altitude solar-powered airplane flight in August, 2008.
Lithium–sulfur batteries may succeed lithium-ion cells because of their higher energy density and reduced cost from the use of sulfur. Currently the best Li-S batteries offer energy densities on the order of 500 W·h/kg, significantly better than most lithium-ion batteries which are in the 150 to 200 range. Li-S batteries with up to 1,500 charge and discharge cycles have been demonstrated, yet are not commercially available (as of early 2014). 
Chemistry.
Chemical processes in the Li–S cell include lithium dissolution from the anode surface (and incorporation into alkali metal polysulfide salts) during discharge, and reverse lithium plating to the anode while charging. This contrasts with conventional lithium-ion cells, where the lithium ions are intercalated in the anode and cathodes. Each sulfur atom can host two lithium ions. Typically, lithium-ion batteries accommodate only 0.5–0.7 lithium ions per host atom.Consequently Li-S allows for a much higher lithium storage density. Polysulfides are reduced on the cathode surface in sequence while the cell is discharging:
Across a porous diffusion separator, sulfur polymers form at the cathode as the cell charges:
These reactions are analogous to those in the sodium–sulfur battery.
Most use a carbon/sulfur cathode and a lithium anode. Sulfur is very cheap, but lacks electroconductivity. Sulfur alone is 5*10−30 S cm−1 at 25°C. A carbon coating provides the missing electroconductivity. Carbon nanofibers provide an effective electron conduction path and structural integrity, at the disadvantage of higher cost.
One problem with the lithium–sulfur design is that when the sulfur in the cathode absorbs lithium, the Li2S has nearly double the volume of the original sulfur. This causes large mechanical stresses on cathode, which is a major cause of rapid degradation. This process reduces the contact between the carbon and the sulfur, and prevents the flow of lithium ions to the sulfur surface.
One of the primary shortfalls of most Li–S cells is unwanted reactions with the electrolytes. While S and are relatively insoluble in most electrolytes, many intermediate polysulfides are not. Dissolving into electrolytes causes irreversible loss of active sulfur.
Safety.
Because of the high potential energy density and the nonlinear discharge and charging response of the cell, a microcontroller and other safety circuitry is sometimes used along with voltage regulators to manage cell operation and prevent rapid discharge.

Focometer

A focometer is an instrument that measures refractive errors and is intended to provide rural or economically disadvantaged populations spherical eyeglass prescriptions without the need for complicated protocols, expensive equipment, or electricity. The focometer is monocular and hand-held, and is normally used in natural lighting. Patients rotate a collar on the focometer until the best focus is achieved. The individual's refractive power is then read off a linear dioptre scale.
The focometer was developed by Drs. Ian Berger and Larry Spitzberg at the University of Houston College of Optometry in Houston, Texas, to provide a simple, inexpensive means for measuring refractive error in human vision. The portable, hand-held instrument is highly appropriate for use in remote and poor areas.
Focometers measure spherical refractive errors. Astigmatism can also be measured using a "clock target" with the device. A study has found, however, that the focometer is less effective for identifying astigmatism than an autorefractor, and that its axis accuracy is limited to 15°.
The advantages of a focometer over other methods for use in developing countries are that it is lightweight, compact, relatively inexpensive, fairly quick, and easy to use with minimal training. A clinical trial compared the repeatability, validity, and ease of use of the focometer with an autorefractor. It found that the focometer results were within 0.75 dioptres of the autorefractor value 84% of the time. The authors found that repeatability of the measurements improved when patients were allowed to "practice" twice on each eye before taking the real reading.

World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia

Reparations were paid to Yugoslavia in the aftermath of World War II. The State Reparations Commission of the Yugoslav Government estimated the total war damages inflicted upon Yugoslavia in World War II at approximately USD 47 billion (1938 values: USD 1 = 44 Yugoslav dinars; Germany – 36 billion, Italy – 10 billion, Hungary – 542 million, Bulgaria – 650 million).
According to the assessment of the Reparations Commission of the Federative Peoples’ Republic of Yugoslavia from 1945, the full amount of war damages, which Yugoslavia suffered during World War II, totaled USD 46.9 billion from 1938, calculated upon the value at the outbreak of war (exchange rate: USD 1 = 44 dinars). From this sum, the German part is USD 35,858 billion. Through the International Reparation Agency, Yugoslavia was compensated the total sum of USD 35,786,118, which represents the value of the old dismantled German factories and other industrial facilities that were transported to Yugoslavia. In response to the summons of the UN Economic and Social Council, West Germany (FRG) paid for indemnification, from the title of a special agreement with Yugoslavia, totaling 8 million German marks, on behalf of the Yugoslav citizens, who were victims of medical experiments on living people during the war. The amounts that were specified in the other international agreements with Germany from March 10, 1956, including 26 million German marks for insurance claims during and after World War II, were excluded from the reparations and are grounded on the implementation of the London Agreement on German External Debts from 1953.
The border between Yugoslavia and Italy was finally settled in the 1970s see Treaty of Osimo.
Under the peace treaties from 1947, Italy was the obligee to reimburse Yugoslavia 125 million for war damages, Hungary 50 million and Bulgaria 25 million, all in U.S. dollars. There was no peace treaty with Germany nor was the total amount of Yugoslavia’s war damages determined by a bilateral or multilateral agreement.
From the title of the Agreement on Friendship with Bulgaria of 1947, signed in Bled, the Yugoslav Government abandoned Bulgarian war indemnities through a unilateral act. Regardless of the fact that in July 1992 the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia promulgated the Declaration on the Annulation of the Decision on Absolving Bulgaria of Compensation for War Damages, there was no legal title under which the question of war damages inflicted by Bulgaria could be raised. 
The questions of war compensation, as they were specified in the peace treaties from 1947 with Italy and Hungary, were finally resolved through bilateral agreements of Yugoslavia with Italy (1954) and Hungary (1956).
Negotiations between the delegations of SFRY and FRG, as well as the Tito-Brandt talks, resulted in the harmonization of the Protocol on Monetary Relief in 1972 (unpublished) and the Agreement on the Approbation of Monetary Relief in 1974 totaling one billion German marks under firmly favorable terms. Yugoslavia paid off two smaller installments and the payments were reprogrammed and postponed several times.
There are some controversies with regard to the interpretation of the legal nature of this agreement. An analysis of this matter points to a typical bilateral onus contract, taking into account the title of the agreement as well as the provisions on multiple matters, including the object of the agreement, parties, amount of credit, interest rate, terms of use, paying the credit off and deciding on which party would enforce this agreement.
However, in the introduction of the Agreement from 1974 it was declared that “in terms of the approval expressed in the Communiqué anent the visit of Chancellor Brandt to Yugoslavia, the remaining open questions from the past should be resolved through long-term cooperation in the economic and other fields with the objective to definitely fulfill this consensus”. This was an indirect way to associate the credit with the reparations through the so-called Tito-Brandt Brioni Formula.
For almost two decades the Yugoslav public was not aware of the existence of the 1973 Aide Mémoire or position paper (a declaration of the Yugoslav Government), which was the condition of the German negotiators for this credit. The existence of the Aide Mémoire was also concealed in the statement of the Federal Secretariat of Foreign Affairs from January 1990, which was issued due to a series of public requests and inquiries of the deputies of both federal and state assemblies on the payment for war damages.
The content of the Aide Mémoire is as follows:
“In principle, the Government of SFRY accepts the proposal of the Government of FRG to compensate the indemnification of Yugoslav victims of Nazi repression in the total sum of one billion German marks in terms of monetary relief (Kapitalhilfe).
On the occasion of making this decision, the Government of SFRY takes into account the good faith, which was formed through the progressive and fruitful cooperation amongst SFRY and FRG, as well as the interests of the two countries to successfully and universally enhance their relations, what without doubt represents a contribution for broader international cooperation.
The Government of SFRY understands that the aforementioned credit shall be given under the most favorable terms, which are provided for credits of this kind. These means shall not be subject to any objects.”
As maintained by Willy Brandt, the so-called Brioni Formula is an “indirect solution” for the payment of reparations through long-term economic cooperation; because of this the President of SFRY Josip Broz Tito and his coworkers gave their consent. Prior to this and at that time the ongoing negotiations, on indemnification of the victims of Nazi repression, agreed upon the number 950 thousand. In reality, it was much larger considering the victims in occupied Yugoslavia and beyond it, and especially in the so-called Independent State of Croatia. There was a possibility that Yugoslavia could receive 2,200 German marks per victim, which would total over 2 billion marks. This would be the implementation of the so-called French model, in accordance with what FR Germany already in the 1960s paid the victims of the other countries, especially Western countries (Israel and the Jewish victims were indemnified earlier).
In the place of such direct remedies, as it was the case with the other countries, a credit of 1 billion with the obligation to pay back was received at the insistence of Germany and by means of the enforcement of the so-called Brioni Formula.

Nouvelle Chanson

Nouvelle Chanson (, meaning "New Song"), sometimes anglicized as New Chanson, is a recently coined buzzword used to define a "new" style of music emerging in France, one which takes inspiration from such forefathers of French Chanson as Jacques Brel, Georges Brassens or Barbara (notably none of them recognize in mastermind Léo Ferré's legacy), albeit in a more soft-pop music style. However, the principal influences appear to be rockiers artists as Serge Gainsbourg or Brigitte Fontaine. Principal French exponents of Nouvelle Chanson include artists such as Benjamin Biolay, Émilie Simon, Coralie Clément, Keren Ann, Francoiz Breut, Olivia Ruiz, and Camille. The term Chanson Nouveau is also used, and as a developing genre, there is considerable disagreement even in France about who belongs in this genre and how it is to be described.
Well-known contemporary English speaking artists who might also be termed New Chanson, in that their musical style is clearly traceable from this same Chanson lineage can be seen in artists such as New York based Rufus Wainwright, his sister Martha Wainwright (who recently reprised Barbara's song 'Dis, quand reviendras-tu ?' -, Regina Spektor (showing French influence in songs such as 'Après moi' and 'Ne me quitte pas'), CocoRosie (originally American, now Paris-based) and London-based singer-songwriter Ana Silvera.
Characteristics of Nouvelle Chanson.
Nouvelle Chanson, whilst influenced by the forefathers of French Chanson (cited above) has developed through modern influences such as rock and electronica. There is a tendency for theatricality and the adoption of personas, alongside intensely poetic lyrics incorporating surreal and metaphorical elements. Wry, intelligent humour is also often prevalent. However the defining characteristic of Chanson, both old and new, is that it focuses on the French language as vehicle and instrument. There is an emphasis on craftsmanship with many of the artists classically trained and/or having studied music academically (cf. Benjamin Biolay studied at the National Conservatoire, Lyon, Emilie Simon studied musicology at the University of Montpellier, and Ana Silvera has performed with the English National Opera and Royal Opera House) giving an intellectual aspect that sets this style of music apart from other genres such as pop, rock and 'anti-folk'.
Subgenres of Nouvelle Chanson.
Nouvelle Chanson artists could be divided into the following genres: 
Literary And Artistic influences.
Nouvelle Chanson takes its inspiration artistically from Dada and Surrealism.
Lyrically, inspiration is also drawn from fairy tales, contemporary poetry, and magical realist literature. It is also theatrical, and draws on the adoption of various personas.
Artists.
France.
"Note: Outside France, there are a number of artists who, although perhaps not Chanson artists as such, seem to fit in with demonstrate an affinity with the movement, such as French-born [http://www.mariannedissard.com]Marianne Dissard working from Tucson in Arizona (USA)."
US.
Artists such as Rufus Wainwright, Beirut (band), Regina Spektor, Marianne Dissard and Antony Hegarty could be classified as "Nouvelle Chanson". Their work is usually highly literary and may employ classical techniques as well as utilizing the waltz style. 
NB: Rufus Wainright is Canadian.

Trevor Cahill

Trevor John Cahill (March 1, 1988) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball. Previously, he pitched for the Oakland Athletics.
Career.
Oakland Athletics.
The Oakland Athletics drafted Cahill in the second round (66th overall) of the 2006 MLB Draft out of Vista High School. In his first full season in minor league baseball, with the Kane County Cougars, he went 11–4 with a 2.73 earned run average, 117 strikeouts and innings pitched over 19 starts to earn a Class A All-Star nod from "Baseball America".
Cahill began with the Stockton Ports of the California League. He went 5–4 with a 2.78 ERA and 103 strikeouts to earn a California League All star selection and a promotion to AA. He also represented America in Major League Baseball's Futures Game.
With the RockHounds, Cahill was 6–1 with a 2.19 ERA before shutting it down in order to compete with the United States national baseball team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
Entering the 2009 season, Cahill was ranked 11th among Baseball America's Top 100 Prospects, and made the Athletics starting rotation out of Spring Training along with his Olympic teammate Brett Anderson. On April 7, 2009, Cahill made his Major League debut against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, going 5 innings, allowing 5 hits, 2 earned runs, striking out 1 and received a no decision.
Cahill came into the 2010 season as a starter for the A's, quickly becoming one of the breakout pitchers of the year. He put up borderline Cy Young Award-worthy statistics, finishing the season with an 18–8 record and an ERA of 2.97, making it into the Top 5 of lowest ERA in the American League, behind Félix Hernández, Clay Buchholz, and David Price, all three considered among best pitchers in the American League. His WHIP was also in the Top 5, with 1.11 WHIP.
Arizona Diamondbacks.
On December 9, 2011, Cahill and Craig Breslow were traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Ryan Cook, Jarrod Parker, and Collin Cowgill.
Personal.
Cahill earned attended Vista High School and committed to Dartmouth College before eventually signing with the A's. He got a 1950 out of 2400 on the SAT.
Cahill warms up to the song "White Rabbit" by Jefferson Airplane.
In the offseason, he lives in Oceanside, California.
Scouting report.
Cahill's best pitch is his sinker, which features excellent downward movement and ranges from 88–92 mph. His sinker is his most frequent offering and is the main reason why he gets so many ground balls. Cahill also has a changeup in the 81–83 mph range, which like his fastball also features excellent downward movement. This is a pitch that he uses frequently against left-handers to get strikeouts. Starting in the 2010 season, Cahill began featuring a 12–6 curveball as well. His curve, which ranges in the 76–80 mph range, has become his main strikeout weapon, and he can get hitters to chase it out of the zone as well as freezing hitters with it in the zone. Cahill also features a rare mid-80s slider against righties, though it is a below average pitch.
In 2012, Cahill added a cutter to his repertoire. Since 2012, he has thrown less fastballs and gone with more of a sinker/cutter combo.

Jepsen features four pitches: a four-seam fastball at 95–99 mph, a two-seam fastball at 94–97, a cutter at 89–93, and a curveball at 83–86. The cutter is rarely used against left-handed hitters, while the two-seamer is primarily thrown to lefties. Jepsen uses his curveball most often in 2-strike counts.

Dr. Zuhayli is widely regarded as one of the foremost experts on Islamic law and legal theory in the world as well as a public intellectual and popular preacher. In his position on the Syrian Majis al-Ifta he is responsible for issuing fatwa or religious edicts. Many of Dr. Zuhayli's edicts can be seen as very moderate - including his support for what he calls Islamic democracy, human rights, and freedom.
Positions and Views on Theological/Doctrinal Matters.
Zuhayli has defended the Ashari and Maturidi schools of belief to be orthodox and defending the option of lay Muslims to follow a madhhab or school of Islamic jurisprudence in their everyday lives. His works on Islamic legal theory establish that traditional Sunni Islamic orthodoxy is defined by that which complies to one of the four valid Sunni madhhab, however he has also stated that following one of the four madhhab is not obligatory - what is religiously obligatory is for the layman, defined as one who has not achieved the ability of independent legal reasoning, is to follow a competent valid orthodox Mufti. He has stated that "the truth is that the majority of Ahl al-Sunnah were of the opinion that one should follow one of the four madhhab, yet others who disagreed with them, and they are also from Ahl al-Sunnah had a different opinion and proofs and this is a place of recorded debate; it is the duty of the Muslim to obey what the scholars agreed upon (ijma) and this is the majority of legal questions, yet he does not have to obey the opinions of any particular group or sect, and we do not establish a ruling of disbelief nor do we argue with such people due to the fact that each group has their proofs, scholars, and teachers." He states that the layman has no madhhab and may simply rely on a valid Mufti with a proper ijaza in one of the madhhab to establish legal rulings. He also defends the right of Muslims to follow different madhhab in different legal questions, as long as this is done with certain conditions such as not doing so to follow the easiest position in every school - although looking for an easier position in another school occasionally is allowed under certain conditions.
His position on celebrating the Prophet Muhammad's birthday or mawlid is that it is permitted and even encouraged as long as it is not believed to be a religious obligation or an act of worship and is free of sin. He has also defended the Qaṣīdah al-Burda poem of Busiri from attacks by some puritanical Muslim groups.
Dr. Zuhayli's position Sufism is considered by some as being moderate while by others as being too harsh and even some as being partially Wahhabi influenced. In many ways he has been critical of what he sees as heretical innovation (bid'ah) and even in some cases what he considers disbelief (kufr) committed by some Sufi groups which he calls "unaccepted" and "blameworthy" such he has opposed is the calling upon pious saints or the Prophet Muhammad to answer one's prayer - believing such possessed omnipotence or power independent of God, which has caused him to be derided by some as being Wahhabi influenced or at least as a modernist . However, al-Zuhayli has defended the practice of beseeching God through the intercession of the Prophet and saints (tawassul) saying this has been "absolutely permitted by the people of the sunnah, whether in life or after death, by many proofs from our scholars who wrote about it in the books of theology and jurisprudence." He has also affirmed that the best litanies are those set down in the Qur'an and hadith. Yet he has also said that joining a Sufi order (tariqa) would be "acceptable" if such an order was learned and in complete compliance to the sharia and orthodox Sunni Islamic theology. 
In one fatwa, Zuhayli clarified what he saw as two types of Sufism:
"There are two types of Sufism: praiseworthy Sufism and blameworthy Sufism. The praised is that which is in agreement with the Qur'an and sunnah. It means the healing of the soul and excellence in directing oneself to God as well as connecting with God which cannot happen without litanies based in the Qur'an and the example of the Prophet Muhammad.
The blamed is that which is in excess of this with its formalities and exaggerations such as the drum and the horn - which fall under deviant innovations. This is what (classical) Islamic legal scholars such as al-Qurtubi stated and it is also my position.
With deep regret, drums and horns have entered into our mosques during mawlid ceremonies, and this is what many scholars had called deviant and without sound foundation (in Islamic law), and this is my position. I love the people of Sufism who are moderate, those who are committed to the Qur'an and sunnah; and I hate (the Sufism) of heretical innovations and that which is alien to Islam, this is my methodology."
Dr. Zuhayli has also been partially critical of Wahhabism or Salafism, using both terms to describe the sect in his edicts. Salafis who fall into anthropomorphism due to their literal interpretation of certain verses of the Qur'an are said to be in "manifest error." He has also condemned certain groups of Salafis who have advocated violence. Yet he has also stated numerous times his dislike for argumentation with Salafis and has stated that "the Wahhabis are not disbelievers," although he has strongly disagreed with many of their views. In addition, it has been noted that Zuhayli at certain points has defended the Wahhabis and supported them and has agreed with their positions.
Islamic International Law.
Dr. Zuhayli is one of the world's leading experts on Islamic international law. His works have been quoted in western scholarly works such as Sohail Hashimi's "Ethics and Weapons of Mass Destruction: Religious and Secular" and Reuven Firestone's "Disparity and Resolution in the Qurʾānic Teachings on War: A Reevaluation of a Traditional Problem". In a scholarly article presented in 2005 to the International Committee of the Red Cross entitled "Islam and International Law" al-Zuhayli argued that the basis between Muslims and non-Muslim countries under Islamic law is one of peace and not war, and that war must be avoided and a last resort to be considered jus ad bellum. Moreover, al-Zuhayli established that combative jihad was only permissible in three specific situations: 
al-Zuhayli also argues that Islamic law maintains that non-combatants must not be killed during a war and that property damage is prohibited unless it is limited to that which directly relates to military combat. He also argues that war must never be waged to force non-Muslims to convert to Islam or for account of their religion, but only in relation to aggression. He bewails the thesis of Samuel P. Huntington relating to the clash of civilizations and instead affirms that the Qur'an praises the diversity of humanity.
Teachers and Students.
Some of Dr. Zuhayli's religious teachers include:
His teachers at Ain Shams University Law School include:
Sheikh Ahmed Issawiya, Sheikh Zaki Din Sha'ban, Dr. Abdel Munim al-Badrawi, Dr. Osman and Dr. Khalil Suleiman Tamawi, Dr. Ali Rashid, Dr. Helmi Murad, Dr. Yahya al-Jamal, Dr. Ali Younis, Dr. Mohamed Ali Imam, and Dr. Aktham Khouli.
His students include:
Dr. Mohamed Al Zoheily his brother, Dr. Mohamed Farouk Hamada, Dr. Muhammad Naeem Yassin, Dr. Abdel-Sattar Abu Ghuddah, Dr. Abdul-Latif Erfurt, Dr. Mohammed Abu Leil, Dr. Abdul Salam Abbadi, Dr. Mohammad Shurbaji, Dr. Majed Abu Sergio, Dr. Hamza Hamza, and other university professors in the Faculty of Sharia, and hundreds of teachers of religious education at the Syrian Education Ministry. As well as over forty who have graduated a generation on its hands in Syria, some in Libya, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and thousands of people in the Orient, Morocco, the United States, Malaysia, Afghanistan, and Indonesia.
Works.
Dr. Zuhayli has written numerous extremely detailed works mostly about Islamic law and legal theory. In total, Dr. al-Zuhayli has written over one hundred and sixty books. Among them are:

Cooper Rawson

Sir (Alfred) Cooper Rawson (26 July 1876 – 11 January 1946) was a British businessman and Conservative Party politician. After a decade in local government, he sat in the House of Commons from 1922 to 1944.
Career.
Business.
Born in Leicester, Rawson established himself in the road stone industry, becoming chairman of several companies, including the Montsorrel Granite Company, the Endaby Stoney Stanton Granite Company, John Ellis and sons, and Durex Ltd. He was a delegate to the International Road Congress in 1923 and in 1926, and in 1930 he was president of the Granite Guild; the following year he was president of the Institute of Quarrying.
Naval reserve.
During World War I, he joined the Royal Naval Division as a sub-lieutenant, transferring in 1916 to the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). He served the rest of the war with the RNVR at The Crystal Palace, becoming a temporary Lieutenant Commander.
Rawson remained involved with the RVR after the war, and in 1925 was made an honorary commander, attached to the RNVR's Sussex Division; in 1940 he was made an honorary Captain of the RNVR.
Politics.
Rawson political career began in 1911, when he was elected to Wandsworth Council. He was a Wandsworth councillor for 11 years, serving as mayor in 1918 to 1919, and was elected to the London County Council (LCC) in 1913.
He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Brighton at the 1922 general election, replacing the Conservative MP Charles Thomas-Stanford, who had retired. He stood down from local government on his election to Westminster and held his seat in the Commons at the next five general elections. Rawson holds the record for the largest number of votes ever polled by a candidate at a British general election, a record he achieved in the 1931 election by polling 75,205 votes. Such a feat also makes Rawson the record holder for the largest majority for an MP, at 62,253. This record was typical of a wider contest which saw an overwhelming Tory victory.
Rawson told his local Conservative Association in October 1943 that he wanted to be relieved of his Parliamentary duties as soon as possible, and retired from Parliament on 17 January 1944, by resigning his seat through the procedural device of accepting appointment as Steward of the Manor of Northstead.
In July 1929, he was presented with a silver dinner bell by the National Federation of Granite and Roadstone Quarry Owners, in recognition of his services to the industry, and in particular of his efforts in blocking a Bill in Parliament which would have led to the expansion of council-owned quarries.
Honours.
Rawson was knighted in the 1926 New Year Honours List, and in 1927 he was awarded the Legion of Honour by the government of France, for his work with the British League of Help.
Family.
Rawson married Elizabeth Robson in 1902. He died on 11 January 1946 at Hove, Sussex, aged 69.

List of federally recognized tribes by state

Federally recognized tribes are those Indian tribes recognized by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs for certain federal government purposes.
Description.
In the United States, the Indian tribe is a fundamental unit of sovereign tribal government, and the constitution grants to the U.S. Congress the right to interact with tribes. More specifically, the Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Sandoval (231 US. 28 ) warned, "it is not... that Congress may bring a community or body of people within range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe, but only that in respect of distinctly Indian communities the questions
whether, to what extent, and for what time they shall be recognized and dealt with as dependent tribes" (at 46). Federal tribal recognition grants to tribes the right to self-government, as well as certain benefits. The recognition process is largely controlled by the United States federal agency the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in consultation with federally recognized tribes.
On October 1, 2010, with a supplemental listing on October 27, 2010, the U.S. government's Federal Register issued an official list of 565 tribes in the Federal Register as "Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible To Receive Services From the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs", which can be downloaded as a PDF document from the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. USA.gov, the federal government's official web portal, also maintains a list of tribal governments which is constantly updated. Ancillary information present in former versions of this list but no longer contained in the current listing have been included here in italics print.

Alexander Baron

Alexander Baron ( – ) was a British author and screenwriter. He is best known for his highly acclaimed novel about D-Day entitled "From the City from the Plough" (1948) and his London novel "The Lowlife" (1963).
Early life.
Baron's father was Barnet Bernstein, a Polish-Jewish immigrant to Britain who settled in the East End of London in 1908 and later worked as a master furrier. Baron was born in Maidenhead and raised in the Hackney district of London. He attended Hackney Downs School.
Politics and wartime.
During the 1930s, with his schoolfriend Ted Willis, Baron was a leading activist and organiser of the Labour League of Youth (at that time aligned with the Communist Party), campaigning against the fascists in the streets of the East End. Baron became increasingly disillusioned with far left politics as he spoke to International Brigade fighters returning from the Spanish Civil War, and finally broke with the communists after the Hitler–Stalin Pact of August 1939.
Baron served in the Pioneer Corps of the British Army during World War II, experiencing fierce fighting in the Italian campaign, Normandy and in Northern France and Belgium. As a pioneer, he was among the first Allied troops to be landed in Sicily, Italy and on D-Day.
Writing career.
He used his wartime experiences as the basis for his three best-selling war novels. After the war he became assistant editor of "Tribune" before publishing his first novel "From the City from the Plough" (1948). At this time, at the behest of his publisher Jonathan Cape, he also changed his name from Bernstein to Baron.
As well as continuing to write novels (for a list of his works, see below), in the 1950s Baron wrote screenplays for Hollywood, and by the 1960s he had become a regular writer on BBC's "Play for Today". He wrote several episodes of the "A Family at War" series: 'The Breach in the Dyke' (1970), 'Brothers in War' (1970), 'A Lesson in War' (1970), 'Believed Killed' (1971), 'The Lost Ones' (1971), and 'Two Fathers' (1972). Later he became well known for drama serials like "Poldark" and "A Horseman Riding By", and in the 1980s for BBC classic literary adaptions including "Ivanhoe", "Sense And Sensibility" (1981), "Jane Eyre" (1983), "Oliver Twist" (1985) and "Vanity Fair" (1987). He contributed several episodes to Granada Television's "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" (1984–1985). For a detailed list of his film and television work, please see his IMDB entry.
In 1991, Baron was elected an Honorary Fellow of Queen Mary, University of London, in recognition of his contribution to the historical and social understanding of East London.
Baron's personal papers are held in the archives of the University of Reading.His wartime letters and unpublished memoirs were used by the historian Sean Longden for his book "To the Victor the Spoils", a social history of the British Army between D Day and VE Day. Baron has also been the subject of essays by Iain Sinclair and Ken Worpole.
Since Baron's death in December 1999 his novels have been republished several times, testifying to a strong resurgence of interest among in his work among the reading public as well as among critics and academics. These include Baron's first book, the war novel "From the City, From the Plough" (Black Spring Press, 2010); his cult novel about the London underworld of the early 1960s, "The Lowlife" (Harvill, 2001; Black Spring Press, 2010), which was cited in Jon Savage’s "England’s Dreaming" as a literary antecedent of punk; "King Dido" (Five Leaves, 2009), a story of the violent rise and fall of an East End London tough in Edwardian England; "Rosie Hogarth" (Five Leaves, 2010); and his second war novel "There's No Home", the story of a love affair between a British soldier and Sicilian woman during a lull in the fierce fighting of the Italian campaign (Sort Of Books, 2011). Baron's third work based on his wartime experiences, "The Human Kind", was republished by Black Spring Press in Autumn 2011. His novel about post-war London, "With Hope, Farewell" (1952), is scheduled for re-issue by Five Leaves Press in 2014.

Samuel Rosbotham

Sir Samuel Thomas Rosbotham (26 June 1864 – 12 March 1950), known as 'Sam Tom', was a British farmer and politician.
Early life.
Born to Samuel and Mary (née Heathcote) in 1864, he carried on his fathers occupation as a farmer at Holly and Stanley farms in Bickerstaffe, before marrying Jane Heyes in 1887, producing seven children. He was elected to Lancashire County Council in 1895, later becoming a county alderman. In 1909 he became chairman of the Lancashire Farmers Association, a post he held for twenty years.
During The First World War he was the chairman of the Ormskirk War Agricultural Committee, working to make short-term credit available for the small farmers. Following the war he was appointed to the Agricultural Wages Board as an employers' representative.
Parliament.
In October 1922 Rosbotham announced his candidacy as an Independent Conservative candidate for his local constituency of Ormskirk at the upcoming general election. In the event he did not contest the election. By the time of the 1924 general election Rosbotham had changed his allegiance to the Labour Party, campaigning against the sitting Conservative MP, Francis Blundell. Following a bitter contest Blundell brought an action for slander against Rosbotham for making "false statements of fact in relation to the plaintiff's character and conduct for the purpose of affecting his return to parliament".
At the next general election in 1929 Rosbotham stood as the Labour candidate against Blundell at Ormskirk, and was elected to the Commons. His victory was thought to be partly due to a change in the nature of the electorate, due to the building of a number of large housing estates by Liverpool City Council in the area.
With the formation of a National Government in August 1931 he moved to the National Labour Organisation. This led to the Ormskirk Divisional Labour Party declaring that he no longer represented them and that they would select another candidate to run against him at the next election. He was formally expelled from the Labour Party in October 1931.
He was appointed as a justice of the peace in 1930, was knighted "for public and political services" in 1933, and was re-elected as a National Labour MP in 1931 and 1935. At the 1935 election both National Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald and his son Malcolm MacDonald lost their seats, and Rosbotham offered to resign to allow either of them to contest the resulting by-election. His offer was not accepted.
Resignation.
In 1938 Rosbotham indicated that he would not be contesting the next general election. This led to a dispute as he failed to give whole-hearted support to Stephen King-Hall, who had been selected to replace him as the National Government's candidate. In April 1939 the local National Government Coordinating Committee passed a resolution that Rosbotham "was not a suitable person to continue to represent the Division in Parliament". In October 1939, aged 75 he chose to retire, resigning his seat by applying for appointment as Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead.
His first wife died in 1945, and in 1946 Rosbotham married Joan Dearden of Waterfoot, Lancashire. 
He died suddenly at his Southport home in March 1950, aged 85, and was buried in the graveyard of Bickerstaffe Parish Church.

Career.
McGregor was called to the bar from the Inner Temple in 1955 and became a Bencher in 1985. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1995.
He was Bigelow teaching Fellow in the University of Chicago, 1950–1951, Visiting Professor at New York University and Rutgers University at various times between 1963 and 1969 and at the University of Edinburgh from 1998. He was a consultant to the Law Commission, 1966–1973.

Selected publications.
At the "Modern Law Review", McGregor has been a member of the Editorial Board since 1986 and was previously a member of the Editorial Committee from 1967.
The Law Commission, together with the Scots Law Commission, asked McGregor to produce a proposal for the codification and union of the laws of contract of England and Scotland, which are based in Common Law. He did so in "Contract Code" (1993). This work was not adopted by either Law Commission, so McGregor got it published by an Italian University. His proposals include, "inter alia", the abandonment of the English doctrine of consideration. Shortly after publication, the European Commission expressed an interest in adopting "Contract Code" as the basis for an EU-wide law of contract, but there has been little progress since then. Instead, the EU passed the Rome I Regulation and the Rome II Regulation, neither of which have been warmly welcomed in English legal circles.

Hunting the Lion–An eyewitness record of 1922 trial of Mahatma Gandhiji

An eyewitness record of 1922 trial of Mahatma Gandhiji Author: Late “Kalaguru” Ravishankar Raval (1892-1977)* -adapted in English by Dr. Kanak Raval, Portland, OR. USA from the original Gujarati text.
This is adapted from the original text in Gujarati published in “Gujaratma Kalana Pagaran” -an autobiography of Shri Ravishankar Raval. In 1922, the British Raj sued Mahatma Gandhiji for sedition. History has recorded it as “The Great Trial” and it is well documented elsewhere. Amongst the few chosen ones in the audience, Ravishankar Raval had witnessed that closed doors trial. Sometime in 1950s he documented the whole event in his autobiography. 
What is interesting is that he recreated the only picture of the trial (shown on the right) as the press photographers were strictly prohibited from covering the event. This oil painting of the court scene was based on the original pencil sketch done surreptitiously by him under the very eyes of the court. Here follows Ravishankar Raval’s own account of the Gandhi Trial of 1922 in his own words.
“As many as 22 policemen were burnt alive by a rampaging mob after the police fired on a procession of Satyagrahis (Activists) in Chauri Chaura near Gorakhpur, India on February 4, 1922. Mahatma Gandhi was shaken by the violence of Chauri Chaura and abruptly called off the non-co-operation movement in 1922 when the movement was at its peak. 
Gandhiji while at Bardoli, Gujarat, on hearing about the Chauri Chaura massacre said:
“Chauri Chaura was a 'divine warning' that the masses were not yet prepared for launching a non-violent struggle to gain freedom for the country.”
In turn, he directed the people to carry out ‘Rachanatmak Karyakram’ (Constructive activities). He considered himself fully responsible for the massacre and went on fasting as atonement. On completion of his fasting, he went to Delhi and got the All India Congress Committee (AICC) to pass a resolution to cancel the proposed Satyagrah (nonviolent resistance) with a provision for any individual person to practice Satyagrah as guided by one’s conscience.
However even after the AICC resolution to withdraw the Satyagrah, India’s British Raj continued to arrest people on a large scale though it was less so in Gujarat. Gandhiji advised people to maintain peace but added that he would consider the individual requests for Satyagrah. He cautioned, “Do not go on strike if the Government arrests me. It would be my greatest honor if my compatriots maintain exemplary peace while I am behind the bars”.
Hunting the Lion.
Now the Raj had resolved to crush the freedom movement completely. On March 10, 1922, Gandhiji and Shankarlal Banker as an editor-producer of NAV JIVAN-YOUNG INDIA were accused for treason and arrested. 
On March 11, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel wrote under the title ‘Hunting the Lion’:
“British Raj has finally dared to imprison the supreme leader of India for his novel and miraculous experiment in the history of the world for liberty and protection of Dharma(Justice). But sooner or later Raj will surrender to the will power of this greatman”
Gandhiji and Banker did not submit any appeal in their defense so magistrate Brown intended to file a bill of indictment with the court of inquiry. The case was to be conducted in a room of the newly built Circuit House at Ahmedabad. As per the advice of Gandhiji, the local Congress leaders directed the populace to stay away from that area. Even then, the authorities declared the daylong curfew in the city of Ahmadabad and the security forces heavily guarded the Circuit House. Only the individuals with special permits were allowed to enter the premises.
Lucky Me!
It was my connection with Shri. Ambalal Sarabhai’s special school for the Sarabhai children that I had the good fortune to attend firsthand the historic trial. Ambalalbhai had a good connection with the District Collector Mr. Chadfield so he pro-cured passes for his whole family including us the group of teachers to attend the trial. We entered the courtroom from the backside of the Circuit House and occupied the row of the vacant chairs at the back of the room. Mr. Standing the Principal of the Sarabhai School set next to me. Only Ambalalbhai and his wife Sarala Devi sat in the front row. A table and chair were placed on the other side of the long room.
Exactly at 11:45 am, Police Superintendent Mr.Hili escorted Gandhiji and Shankalal Banker in a special one First Class carriage pulled by a steam engine from the Sabarmati Jail up to the railway crossing and then onward in a car. Everyone in the court rose to his or her feet out of respect as Gandhiji entered the courtroom. Gandhiji was dressed in his proverbial loincloth but his face projected a saintly aura.
As the clock struck 12 noon, Mr. C. N. Broomfield, I.C.S., District and Sessions Judge appointed specially by the Bombay Presidency entered the courtroom and took his seat behind the table. Immediately, the District Magistrate read aloud the indictment. He defined the charges of causing civil unrest and sedition and asked Gandhiji,
“Are you accepting the charges as stated or do you wish to have the court proceedings against you?”
Gandhiji stood up and stated in a steady tone in the quiet room,
“I accept the accusation”.
Shankarlal Banker also did the same thing. The Bombay Government as the prosecution attorney sent the Advocate General Mr. Armstrong. He stated:
“Due process of law should be carried out not for proving the crime but to determine the magnitude of penalty”.
Having heard his arguments, the judge did not change his decision of not conducting the trial further and declared:
“Only item left now is to announce the punishment but I am prepared to listen if the defendant has something to say about the punishment”.
No Camera!
At that moment, I got the inspiration! 
I mused, 
“There is no cameraman present to capture this historic event! 
There is strict police security.” 
I looked around. A couple of reporters were taking notes. My friend Mr. Standing had jotted down few points. 
I asked myself, 
”Am I just going to nurse these memorable moments? What good are my sketching skills as an artist?” 
I immediately took out my permanent companion -a small pocket sketchbook. Hiding the sketchbook by one hand to keep unseen by others, I neatly sketched down the facial features of Gandhiji and his wife KasturBaa. I sketched out the surrounding court scenario and the important characters of this high drama. 
I was mentally in a high state of excitement and slightly worried that police may confiscate my sketchbook! However, the trial did not continue longer and the presiding judge had already asked Gandhiji if he wished to make a statement.
The Defendant’s Response.
In response, Gandhiji expressed his wish to read out his statement. There was pin drop silence in the courtroom. That long confession is now a well-known historical document. I am just quoting some of them here: 
“Even when I am released I would repeat whatever I have done”
“I am here, therefore, to invite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.”
“I do not have any enmity with any official or an administrator so I cannot have anything against the punishment. But to bear enmity to the disservice that the British Raj has meted out to India compared to other rulers is a virtue for me.”
Gandhiji’s confession was the severest accusation against the British Raj. Thousands of years ago, virtuous So-crates had welcomed the cup of poison as a punishment. Jesus Christ sacrificed himself on cross for holding on to his own life philosophy.
On completion of Gandhiji’s statement, the Judge cited the court trial of Lokmanya Tilak as precedence and based on the same ruling announced six years of imprisonment to Gandhiji and added, 
“Nobody would be happier than me the day the Government releases you from the prison”.
Gandhiji accepted the judgment.
As soon as the legal proceedings were over, all the officials left. Ashram members and the other well-wishers paid their respects to Gandhiji and returned home. The same waiting train took Gandhiji away to Yaravada Central Prison near Pune, Maharashtra. City of Ahmadabad was left under a cover of sadness!
My diary of that day noted.
“British Raj has meted out six years of imprisonment to Gandhiji, the Soul Incarnate of India. Broomfield and General Armstrong adoring the throne of Justice looked like Lilliputians in presence of a Man Lion. It appears that God has created this situation to be a ray of hope for Mother India. Destiny is recreating a new history for India that had become an object of pity and curiosity by the world for thousands of years. This one man’s high character will remain as the foundation stone of character for future men and women of India. Known historical ideals remain pale before this man. How fortunate I am to see alive this unique example of humanity!”
Then!
The British rulers speculated that once Gandhiji was behind bars, the entire freedom fight would just evaporate. On the contrary, who knew that it was the beginning of new age for India’s freedom from the British masters! The next day when Mr. Standing met me at the school, with great interest he asked me to show him my previous day’s artwork at the court trial. I had my sketchbook with me. He was so impressed with those historic images. He had already penned down a detailed account of the court trial for dispatching it to England‘s renowned news paper Manchester Guardian so he requested my sketches for including in the article. I was overjoyed for such an instant recognition of my sketches and immediately took out the pages for him. After about a month, to my great surprise he put in my hands an April 8, 1922 copy of the Manchester Guardian. It had his entire Gandhi Trial report with all my sketches in their original sizes printed at the top. Although they were pencil sketches, images were sharp with my signature mark as an artist. Additionally he placed in my hands a 10 Rupees bill (One Rupee of 1922 equivalent of probably purchasing power of today’s 1000 Rupees in 2008!-Editor) as an artist’s honorarium sent by the editors. I have no recall of any fees paid to me for my published pictures in India! Most important matter to me was that an overseas newspaper had published my artwork.
This was followed by amazing news. That issue of Manchester Guardian also found its way to Gandhiji’s personal secretary Mahadevbhai Desai who also was in prison at Agra. He was so excited by seeing the images of Gandhiji and Kastur Baa that he specially mentioned it in his letter to his close colleague Jugatarambhai Dave as follows:
“A few weeks back, MANCHESTER GUARDIAN published an excellent report on Bapu’s (Gandhiji’s familiar address by those close to him) court trial. It is a very lucidly written news report. Its translation should have been published in NAV JIVAN. SWARAJ from Madras did publish it. This report is more valuable since it contains sketches of Bapu, Baa (KasturBaa familiar address by those close to her), Giradharlal Shah (prosecuting lawyer) done by Ravishankar Raval. These images would remain immortal. I did not realize what a great artist Ravishankar Raval is! The best sketch is of Baa. Baa reminds us of St.Medonna. Her face radiates indescribable peace and compassion. You should have shared those images to the readers of NAV JIVAN. But we have ways to go in journalism otherwise how come Raval’s sketches are published in Manchester Guardian but not in NAVJIVAN?”
Today after 50 years (as of 1972-Editor), that Circuit House has been declared as a memorial to Gandhiji’s trial but in there only the framed news paper reports have been exhibited. Luckily, by that time I had some contact with Mr. Standing. He had put to gather his memoirs of his stay in India in a bound volume titled “Letters from India”. He had included in there my Gandhiji sketches along with a number of sketches of the events of the past. I had requested those sketches back but for some reason that did not happen. Eventually, my young friend Vinayak Pandya settled in London visited the editors at the Manchester Guardian, gave them the details of the Gandhiji’s 1922 trial, and requested for a Photostat copy of the original published report. Within four days, he airmailed to me the copies. 
Based on those sketches, I recreated a full size oil painting (Sometimes in 1950s-Editor). I offered it to the Government of Gujarat then but there was no interest! During the same time the Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court, Nanubhai G. Shelat unearthed from the court arc-hives, the original judgment hand written by the judge Mr. C. N. Broomfield and published a special document in which he included my sketches considered by him of important value. Eventually “MAHATMA GANDHI LEKH SANGRAH PRAKASHAN SANSTHA” of New Delhi and the Gujarat Government (in a calendar) published it.
Postscript by the Editor: '"“Long Live the Lion in eternity, Hunter is now a part of antiquity!”
Or, shall we say? 
"Long Live the Lion, Hunter is dead!""'

Sir Harry Mallaby-Deeley, 1st Baronet

Sir Harry Deeley Mallaby-Deeley, 1st Baronet (27 October 1863, London – 4 February 1937, Cannes) was a British Conservative politician.
Harry Deeley was educated at Shrewsbury School and Trinity College, Cambridge. His brother was the theatrical producer Frank Curzon.
He was the founder and first President of Prince’s Golf Club at Mitcham. With his Cambridge University friend Percy Montagu Lucas he provided most of the capital to create new links at Sandwich, now Prince's Golf Club, Sandwich, the land being donated by the Earl of Guilford. The course was designed by Charles Hutchings, the 1902 Amateur Champion, and laid out between 1904 and 1906.
In 1913 he purchased the whole of the Duke of Bedford's Covent Garden estate for £2m., having already been involved in the purchase of the Piccadilly Hotel and St. James's Court, Buckingham Gate. 
In 1922 he famously acquired control of the large estates of the cash-strapped Duke of Leinster during the latter's lifetime. Fitzgerald had previously sold Mallaby-Deeley his reversionary rights to the estate for a notional consideration, not expecting, as a younger son, to inherit.
Deeley was elected Member of Parliament for Harrow in 1910 and for Willesden East in 1918, resigning in 1923. In 1922 he assumed the additional name of Mallaby, his mother's maiden name, by deed poll and was created a baronet (of Micham Court, Surrey).

Edward Charles Williams

Edward Charles Williams (10 July 1807 - 25 July 1881) was an English landscape painter during the Victorian Era, and a member of the Williams family of painters.
Biography.
Edward Charles Williams was born on 10 July 10, 1807 in London. He was the eldest son of the painter Edward Williams (1781-1855) and Ann Hildebrandt (c.1780-1851), and a member of the Williams family of painters, who were related to such famous artists as James Ward, R.A. and George Morland. His father was a well-known landscape artist, who taught him how to paint; otherwise he received no formal instruction. He adopted much of his father's style and technique, and like the other painters of his family, he devoted himself to landscapes, producing rich and tranquil views of Barnes, Cumberland, Kent, Surrey and the Thames. His paintings are now highly sought after.
Williams married his first wife Mary Ann Challenger on 11 December 1839 in Westminster. Mary Ann died in 1857 in London, and his only child Alice Williams was born shortly afterwards to Sarah Susannah Horley, who had been Mary Ann's nurse – Edward and Sarah did not marry for another 10 years until 3 October 3, 1868, when they wed at the St. Pancras Old Church in Camden, London.
He largely stopped painting after the 1859 death of his second wife, adding value to the small number of paintings that he did produce from 1859 on − "Springer in the Bracken", "The Lap Dog", "The Ploughman's walk home", "The Ducks at Tilbury" and "Primrose at St Mary's" (Primrose was the Verger's Cat). Some suggest that he suffered a breakdown after his wife's death, given his choice of subjects in these later years. The location of three of these post-1859 works are unknown, and they are assumed lost during two world wars.
He signed some of his work as "E Williams", which leads to confusion with his father, who painted in a similar style, and at times he signed as "C Williams" to purposely avoid such confusion. Because many of the paintings of both father and son are unsigned, it can be difficult to correctly attribute their work. Edward Charles also collaborated on several paintings with William Shayer, where Williams would paint the landscape, and Shayer would add in figures and animals. "The Old Roadside Inn" shown on the lower right is one example of such a collaboration between Shayer and Williams, and "Near Wantage, Berkshire" is yet another. He died 25 July 1881 at Shepherds Bush in London.
The Williams Family.
Edward Charles Williams was born into an artist family that is sometimes referred to as the Barnes School. His father and five surviving brothers (listed below) were all noted landscape painters during the Victorian era. Three of the sons of Edward Williams changed their last names to protect the identity of their art.

Todd Dusosky

Todd Dusosky (born May 12, 1976 in Anoka, Minnesota) is a retired American soccer forward who spent most of his career with indoor teams. He also played a handful of seasons in the USL A-League.
Soccer.
Dusosky graduated from Anoka High School in 1994. After spending one year attending Viterbo College in La Crosse, Wisconsin, he turned professional. In 1995, he began his career with the Cleveland Crunch of the National Professional Soccer League. That season the Crunch won the league championship as Dusosky was named a second team All Star. He then began the 1996-1997 season in Cleveland, but on December 26, 1996, the Crunch sent Dusosky and several other players, to the Milwaukee Wave in exchange for Matt Knowles. During his years with the Wave, he played every winter indoor season with the team in addition to playing indoors or outdoors with other teams during the summer seasons. During his twelve years with Milwaukee, Dusosky has won four championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2005), been named the 2005 MISL Finals MVP and the 2006 All Star Game MVP. He is also a three time MISL All Star. He has been plagued with injuries over the last few years, losing half of the 2004-2005 season and most of 2007-2008. In 1997, Dunosky spent the summer with the Minnesota Thunder of the A-League. On May 29, 1998, he signed with the Lafayette SwampCats of the Eastern Indoor Soccer League. The Swamp Cats won the league title and Dusosky led the league in scoring. On March 20, 2000, he signed a two year contract with the Milwaukee Rampage of the USL A-League. He spent that season with the Thunder, but did not return in 2001. In 2003, he signed with the Milwaukee Wave United an USL A-League affiliate of the Milwaukee Wave. United played two seasons before folding.
Futsal.
Between 1998 and 1999, he earned five caps with the United States national futsal team. He continued to play for the Futsal team through the 2004 FIFA Futsal World Cup, but his total number of caps is unknown.
Professional wrestling.
In addition to his soccer career, Dusosky and his twin brother Troy were professional wrestlers known as The Super Ds in the NWF Kids Pro Wrestling’s lightweight division. The brothers were the promotion's first Lightweight Tag Team Champions when the title was introduced on April 15, 1985. They held the belts for over a month before dropping them to the team of Rough Ryan and Mean Dean on May 25. On February 15 the following year, they regained the title by defeating Rough Ryan and Invader I. On May 9, they lost the title belts to The Rough Russians but won them back in a rematch on July 26. Their final reign ended when their mother refused to allow them to compete due to an upcoming soccer tournament. They were stripped of the championship on October 18, 1986, and the belts were awarded to The Blade Runners by forfeit. They were scheduled for a title shot inside a steel cage against The Blade Runners in February 1987 as part of the NWF's "Star Cage '87" but the event was scrapped in early January of that year.

James Clayton (priest)

James Clayton (b. at Sheffield, England, date of birth not know; d. 22 July 1588) was an English Roman Catholic priest.
Life.
He was the son of a shoemaker, apprenticed to a blacksmith for seven years. He spent his leisure hours in educating himself, giving special attention to the study of Latin. His studies led him to embrace the Catholic religion, and he was sent to the English College at Reims (1582), where he was ordained priest in 1585.
He immediately returned to England on mission work in Yorkshire. Four years later, while visiting the Catholic prisoners in Derby gaol, he was apprehended and condemned to death for exercising his priestly office. His brothers pleaded for his pardon and his execution was delayed, though he was still kept a prisoner. Prison life brought on a sickness of which he died, as a prisoner in Derby gaol.

John Curry (historian)

John Curry (b. in Dublin, Ireland, in the first quarter of the eighteenth century; d. there, 1780) was an Irish doctor of medicine, historian, and Roman Catholic activist.
Life.
He studied medicine at Paris and Reims and returned to Dublin to practise his profession. Curry took part in the campaign of the Irish Catholics for the repeal of penal laws, and was one of the founders, with Charles O'Conor, of the Catholic Committee which met in Essex Street, 1760.
Works.
He published in London, in 1747, a "Brief Account from the most authentic Protestant writers of the Irish Rebellion, 1641", against partisan anti-Catholic history. This book was bitterly attacked by Walter Harris in a 1752 volume published in Dublin, and in reply Curry published his "Historical Memoirs", afterwards enlarged and published in 1775 under the title "An Historical and Critical Review of the Civil Wars in Ireland". This is his major work; a new edition of it, enlarged from Curry's manuscript, was published by Charles O'Connor in two volumes (Dublin, 1786) and again in one volume (Dublin, 1810). In this work, after a brief glance over the developments in Ireland after the invasion of Henry II of England, he takes up the history at the reign of Elizabeth I of England and carries it down to the Settlement under William III of England. 
Besides these, he published "An Essay on Ordinary Fevers" (London, 1743) and "Some Thoughts on the Nature of Fevers" (London, 1774).

Sidney Richard Percy

Sidney Richard Percy (1821-1886) was an English landscape painter during the Victorian era, and a member of the Williams family of painters.
Biography.
Life and career.
Sidney Richard Percy was born Sidney Richard Percy Williams in 1821 in London. He was the fifth son of the painter Edward Williams (1781-1855) and Ann Hildebrandt (c.1780-1851), and a member of the Williams family of painters, who were related to such famous artists as James Ward, R.A. and George Morland. His father was a well-known landscape artist, who taught him how to paint; otherwise he received no formal instruction. Although his early paintings were signed "Sidney Williams", he used the name "Percy" from the age of 20 onwards to differentiate himself from the other artists in his family. Starting in 1842, he exhibited at the Royal Academy (65 works), the British Institution (48 works), and the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists (67 works). He also exhibited in many of the lesser-known Victorian art venues as well.
His early years were spent in or near the artist's quarter of Tottenham Court, before moving about 1846 with his family to Barnes on the outskirts of London. Here he lived and worked with his father and brothers in a communal artist setting in a large house with a studio that they shared at 32 Castelnau Villas. Barnes today is part of the urban sprawl of London, but much of it was rural countryside in Victorian times. Situated close to the Thames River, there were quiet marshes beneath windmills, farms where horses pulled plows, and wheel-rutted dirt roads running past country inns or through shaded glens. These were the scenes that the Williams brothers captured on canvas during their early years as painters, but as Sidney Richard Percy matured as a landscape painter he increasingly sought his inspiration in Northern Wales, Devon, Yorkshire, the Lake District and Skye.
He moved after his 1857 marriage to the Florence Villas on Inner Park Road in Wandsworth, Surrey, and then moved his family about 1863 to "Hill House" in the village of Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. Hill House was well-placed for painting forays into the English countryside, situated as it was across from the Misbourne Valley. He was extremely popular during these years, which brough him sufficient income to indulge the extravagant tastes of his wife, which included a carriage and several servants.
Percy traveled in 1865 to Venice with his friend and neighbor the water colour artist William Callow (1812-1908), and returned visiting Switzerland and Paris. Although war between Prussia and Austria in 1866 put an end to these travels, he returned home to ample artistic inspiration in the Welsh countryside, where he spent many days painting in and around the villages of Llanbedr and Arthog, on either side of the Mawddach estuary in Merioneth. He also made painting forays to the Scottish Highlands.
He spent his final years at Mulgrave Road in Sutton, Surrey, where his knee was injured when he was thrown from a horse in a riding accident. When his leg had to be amputated as a consequence, he died prematurely on 13 April 1886 at his home of a heart attack due complications from the operation. Though once quite wealthy, his finances at the time of his death were no longer robust, and his widow had to be supported in her final years by her son-in-law.
Marriage and children.
Sidney Richard Percy Williams married Emily Charlotte Fairlam (1835-1904), the daughter of Richard Fairlam, on 30 June 1857 in the Barnes Parish Church. He and Emily had four children.
Sidney Richard Percy's daughter Amy Dora Percy exhibited one painting at the Royal Academy, and married the chemist Richard Freshfield Reynolds (1860-1907), but she is best known for a collection of poems and several novels she wrote as Mrs. Fred Reynolds. Her brother Herbert Sidney Percy (1863-1932) studied at the Royal Academy of Art, where he won two silver medals in painting, and exhibited one painting at the Academy. He became a professional artist whose portraits and miniatures hang in the homes of many prominent English families. He also painted landscapes, and illustrated books, particularly those of his close friend G.K. Chesterton.
The Williams family.
Sidney Richard Percy was born into an artist family that is sometimes referred to as the Barnes School. His father and five surviving brothers (listed below) were all noted landscape painters during the Victorian era. Percy was one of three of the sons of Edward Williams who changed their last names to protect the identity of their art.
Art.
Influence.
Sidney Richard Percy had his greatest success painting landscapes of grazing cattle, typically set against backgrounds of distant mountains and cloudy skies. The prevailing hues of his landscapes are earth tones and soft greens, accentuated by a variety of pastel hues. The detail in his work is part of its appeal, and ""it was remarked that his rocks and stones were sufficiently accurate to have served as illustrations to the writings of Sir Roderick Murchison, the popular 19th-century geologist."" "Llyn-y-Ddinas, North Wales", one his more popular works on the internet, displays these qualities. He also painted landscapes of farm fields, wheel-rutted country roads, and the occasional boat scene on a lake.
His art interests were not limited to painting, and he was also an amateur photographer, in a day when photography was new and exciting, yet still a poorly understood medium. He frequently used his own photographs of gypsies in the Barnes or Wimbledon Common as the basis for similar figures in his paintings, even though some contemporary critics complained how these figures ruined what otherwise would be delightful landscapes. A classic example is "Storm Gathering on Cader Idris, North Wales", which he exhibited in 1856 at the Royal Academy, and which has the same gypsy girls in it as one of seven of his photographs in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In fact, this painting is one of the ones singled out for some of the aforementioned criticism. These same girls appear in his 1861 work "A Rest on the Roadside", and they appear again, but reversed, in his 1873 version of "Llyn-y-Ddinas, North Wales", showing that he repeated themes when convenient.
Although he generally painted in oils, a number of small watercolors on cardboard exist, typically unsigned, that are his work. The family, and his son the painter Herbert Sidney Percy in particular, referred to these as ""potboilers"", meaning that they were quickly, and often crudely executed, yet easily and cheaply sold "to put food on the table" when working on larger, more time-consuming oils for exhibition, or commissions. Many of these watercolor "potboilers" were done in the field, and then brought back to the studio to refer to when executing a more formal oil on canvas.
Sidney Richard Percy was extremely popular during the early part of his career, which for a short time brought him a fair amount of income. Among his patrons during this time was Prince Albert the Royal consort who in 1854 gave Percy's landscape of "A view of Llyn Dulyn, North Wales," which had just been exhibited at the Royal Academy, as a gift to his wife Queen Victoria. This painting still hangs today in the Royal Collection. Unfortunately Sidney Richard Percy outlived his popularity, and the art world was more excited about impressionism and other styles than landscapes when he died. Today though, his work is much sought after, and his better paintings bring much higher prices in auction than any of those of his brethren in the Williams family.
When the Athenaeum in 1886 (i. 592) ran an obituary for Sidney Richard Percy they called him, ""the well-known and popular painter, founder of the so-called School of Barnes . . ."" Although depending on the context of what is meant by the so-called Barnes School, this is a bit of an injustice to his father Edward Williams, whom it might be argued is the founder of the Barnes School of painters, but it illustrates the popularity that Sidney Richard Percy held with the art-buying public of his day.

Bashaw (Matthew Cotes Wyatt)

Bashaw, a Newfoundland dog, sat some fifty times for his portrait. His owner, Lord Dudley and Ward, commisssioned the marble sculpture from Matthew Cotes Wyatt (1777-1862) in 1831. The work was to have been displayed in Lord Dudley's house in Park Lane, but he died the year before it was finished, in 1833, and "Bashaw" remained in the possession of the sculptor until his death in 1862. Dogs' portraits were occasionally painted during the nineteenth century, but this elaborate lifesize sculpted piece, originally set with gems is unique. In 1851 it was shown at The Great Exhibition, where it was entitled "The Faithful Friend to Man Trampling Underfoot his Most Insidious Enemy", in reference to the bronze cobra beneath the dog's feet. The placid expression of the dog, and the elegant cushion on which he stands, contrast with the coiled energy of the snake.
The sculpture remained unsold at the sale of Wyatt's effects after his death in 1862, and fell into the possession of his son, James, who put it up for sale at Christie's in 1887. It was unsold, but subsequently passed into the possession of John Corbett of Impney Hall, Droitwitch, Worcestershire, and was then sold to Edward Stevens of Prescott House, Stourbridge, in 1906. In 1957 the sculpture was sold again; it was bought by the Victoria and Albert Museum for £200 in 1960.
Matthew Cotes Wyatt (1777-1862) was the son of the architect James Wyatt, and was a painter and designer as well as a sculptor. The elaborate base made for Bashaw reflects his abilities in the field of decorative arts. In 1834 Wyatt held an exhibition of his works with "Bashaw" as the centrepiece. It was described in the catalogue as 'the most elaborate of a quadruped ever produced by ancient or modern art'.
The sculpture is made of coloured marbles and hardstones. The dog's eyes are topaz, sardonyx and black lava, while the snake is bronze with ruby eyes. The cushions are of gilt bronze.

Hein Verbruggen

Hein Verbruggen (born 21 June 1941 in Helmond) is a Dutch honorary member of the International Olympic Committee since 2008. Previously, he was a member of the IOC and Chairman of the Coordination Commission for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad in Beijing in 2008. He was president of the Union Cycliste Internationale from 1991 till 2005.
Biography.
Verbruggen studied at the Nyenrode Business Universiteit. Afterwards, he became a sales manager. In 1970, when he was a sales manager at Mars, Incorporated, he convinced them to sponsor a cycling team, to get access to the Belgian market.
In 1975, he became a member of the professional cycling committee of the Royal Dutch Cycling Union (KNWU).
In 1979, Verbruggen became a member of the board of the Fédération Internationale de Cyclisme Professionnel (FICP). He became vice-president in 1982, and president in 1984.
From 1991 to 2005, Verbruggen was president of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). From 1996 on, he was also member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
During that time, Verbruggen combined the FICP (for professional cyclists) and the FIAC (for amateur cyclists) in the UCI. Because the Olympic organisation had the FIAC as partners, it had been impossible before then for professional cyclists to enter the Olympic Games, but from the 1996 Summer Olympics, professional athletes could compete. In his last year, he installed the UCI ProTour.
In 2005, Verbruggen became Officer in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Later that year, Verbruggen resigned as president of the UCI, and became vice-president. He then stopped being a member of the IOC, but was reinstated during the 2006 Winter Olympics. 
After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Verbruggen resigned as member of the IOC. The IOC then made him an honorary member, as did the Dutch Olympic Committee.
As of 2012, Verbruggen remained an "honorary president" of UCI and was still on its management committee.
Controversy.
In July 2008, a BBC investigation found documents indicating that over three million dollars were paid by Japanese race organizers as reimbursements for UCI expenses during Verbruggen's tenure as president, including five flights to the Netherlands for Verbruggen personally in 1999. The investigation cited sources within the UCI who confirmed that the repayments were "explicitly a payback for getting keirin into the Games". Verbruggen denied any wrongdoing, and the UCI ignored BBC requests for clarification.
In May 2010, Floyd Landis accused Verbruggen of accepting a $100,000 bribe from Lance Armstrong to cover-up a positive dope control in 2001. Verbruggen denied the allegation, but confirmed that Armstrong representatives had approached the UCI with the intention of donating money. Verbruggen indicated that Armstrong's money would not have gone toward testing, but may have been used to purchase a Sysmex machine to analyze blood samples. Pat McQuaid, Verbruggen's successor as UCI president, later confirmed that Armstrong made two donations during Verburggen's tenure: a personal check for $25,000 in 2002, which went toward doping controls for junior racers, and a $100,000 donation from Armstrong's management company in 2005, which went toward the Sysmex machine. Given UCI's endorsement of USADA's decision: that the donation was made by the leader of one of the most sophisticated, systematic and successful doping programs in sporting history, ironically, for the express purpose of improving doping controls, Verbruggen's acceptance of the donation has not been without controversy. McQuaid also conceded that the UCI's acceptance of Armstrong's money may have been a mistake.
In July 2010, an email correspondence between Landis and Verbruggen was leaked to The New York Daily News, in which Verbruggen attacked Landis in the wake of accusations Landis made about the UCI and Lance Armstrong. The e-mails were later reproduced at Cyclingnews.com. 
USADA's "Reasoned Decision" on Lance Armstrong quotes Verbruggen as saying in May 2011: "There is nothing. I repeat again: Lance Armstrong has never used doping. Never, never, never. I say this not because I am a friend of his, because that is not true. I say it because I'm sure." 
Defamation suits.
Verbruggen (sometimes along with Pat McQuaid) has been involved in several defamation suits against people who accused UCI of corruption in regards to doping. 
In 2002 UCI sued Festina soigneur Willy Voet for defamation over claims in his book "Breaking the Chain". In 2004 the UCI won the case, and in 2006 won the appeal. Voet had made various claims about UCI and Verbruggen's alleged behavior related to an alleged issue with Lidocaine and Laurent Brochard at the 1997 UCI Road World Championships.
Another defamation suit was brought against Floyd Landis in 2011 for some of the aforementioned claims about Lance Armstrong and the UCI. The case against Landis was ruled in UCI's favor. 
Another defamation lawsuit was against WADA Chief Dick Pound regarding his comments about doping and UCI. The lawsuit was settled by the parties in 2009.
Another was filed against former cyclist and journalist Paul Kimmage in 2012, again related to the accusations about Armstrong and UCI. The lawsuit was later dropped, but Kimmage had received money from the public to prepare a defense, so he decided to sue the UCI himself in a criminal court. He stated that he was doing it for the whistleblowers who were defamed by the UCI.

Asian Games Federation

The Asian Games Federation (AGF) was the governing body of sports in Asia from 1949 to 1981. The federation was disbanded on 26 November 1981, in New Delhi and replaced by the Olympic Council of Asia. The AGF was responsible for the organisation of the Asian Games from 1951 to 1978. The Federation was established on 13 February 1949, in a meeting held in Patiala House in New Delhi.
Establishment.
In March 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, who later became the first prime minister of India, held the Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi—a meeting with a prospect to bring the possibility of Asian Games under the attention of participating countries. Before the conference, Guru Dutt Sondhi, who was the member of the International Olympic Committee for India, encouraged Yadavindra Singh, Maharaja of Patiala and the then-president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), to communicate with meeting attendees to establish the Asian Games Federation. The proposal was not acknowledged by some representatives and the rest, who approved, refused to make any commitment.
In July 1947, the IOA, which initially was advocating the organisation of Games, retracted its patronage for unknown reasons. Sondhi found an alternative; rather than organising a multi-sport event, for which he needed an approval of the IOA, he opted for a single event championship titled the Asian Athletic Championships—a track and field event. Sondhi, who was also the president of the Amateur Athletic Federation of India (AAFI) (now Athletics Federation of India), received the consent of federation in February 1948. Yadavindra, on the request of Sondhi, became the president of the organising committee for the Championship, and Sondhi took the position of chairman. In early July, formal invitations were sent to various Asian countries, backed by the letter from the AAFI. But the response was not positive as there was a scheduling conflict with the 1948 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled from 29 July.
Meeting in London.
During the 1948 Olympic Games, Sondhi held a meeting on 8 August 1948, at Mount Royal Hotel in London. Invitations were sent to all the Asian National Olympic Committees present in London at that time. Chief Managers of Korea, China, Philippines, Singapore, Burma, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria were called for the meeting, but only representatives from Burma, Ceylon, China, India, Philippines, and Korea attended. Sondhi made two proposals: first, to organise an Asian Athletic Championship in February 1949 in New Delhi, and second, to establish the Asian Games Federation, based on the IOC model. Founder of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation and first Filipino member of the International Olympic Committee Jorge B. Vargas stoutly backed the second proposal, and the first proposal was accepted by the attendees with an amendment. For the further development of the federation, a decision was made to conduct a meeting during the Championship in New Delhi in February 1949, and a sub-committee, consisting representatives from four nations, was appointed to draft the constitution and ordinances of the federation.
Meeting in Delhi.
The Asian Athletics Championship was not realised due to "unsettled conditions" and economic difficulties of participating nations, but a meeting was organised at the Patiala House, in Delhi, among the representatives of nine Asian nations, on 12 and 13 February 1949. The meeting was attended by the representatives of Afghanistan, Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand. The drafted constitution, presented by the sub-committee, was again revised as per the Olympic Charter—the constitution of the International Olympic Committee—and accredited. To avoid the ambiguity generated by the literal meaning of term "athletic", sub-committee rectified the primitively proposed title of the federation from Asian Amateur Athletic Federation to Asian Games Federation. Afghanistan, Burma, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines became the first five members of the Asian Games Federation after signing the constitution in its full term; the other four attendees also signed it, but it still needed the ratification by their governments or their National Sports Associations. The federation elected Yadavindra Singh as the president, Jorge B. Vargas as vice-president, and G. D. Sondhi as secretary treasurer.

Keith Prowse

Keith Prowse is a trading name currently used by two separate companies. Within the United Kingdom it is used by the Sport, Leisure and Hospitality Division of Compass Group Plc (who provide catering facilities), the company operates at numerous prestigious venues for many of the world's most iconic sporting and cultural events including Cirque du Soleil, Chelsea Flower Show and Wimbledon. While outside of the United Kingdom the Keith Prowse name is used by the Seatem Group Limited.
History.
Robert William Keith (1767–1846), a musical composer, instrument maker and organist at the New Jerusalem Church, Friars Street, London, opened a shop in London in the late 18th century, in 1830 he entered a partnership with another musical instrument manufacturer and music publisher, William Prowse (1801–1886), to form Keith, Prowse & Co.
The company entered the theatre ticketing business after acquiring "Theater Ticket Messengers" a company which used young message boys to go to theatres and either hold seats or collect seat tokens for favoured clients. The first reference to the firm's selling theatre tickets appeared in an article published in 1786 in the "Morning Chronicle", referring to "The New System of Ticket Agents". One of the first ticketing companies to have a telephone installed, Keith Prowse appeared in the first UK telephone directory published in 1880. In 1886, the company first represented Royal Ascot, opened the World's first flight ticket booking office at Brooklands near Weybridge, Surrey, in 1911 and soon opened another at London Aerodrome. In 1924, they first represented the Wimbledon Championships.
In 1954, Peter Cadbury borrowed £75,000 from his father to buy the Keith Prowse ticket agency, which went public in 1960, and later became a subsidiary of Westward Television. In 1969, EMI bought Keith Prowse Music Publishing and Central Songs. Keith Prowse Music released many recordings of library music by composers such as Alan Hawkshaw. In 1981, the company opened its first office outside the UK in New York and a further office was established in Dublin in 1982. In the same year, the company was officially appointed by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club through its purchase of Ashton & Mitchell which held royal appointment and rights to Wimbledon.

Lakes in Bangalore

Lakes in Bangalore city (Kannada:ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು) in Karnataka are numerous, and there are no rivers close by. by constructing bunds.
The effect of urbanization has taken some heavy toll on the Beautiful lakes in Bangalore. The lakes in the city have been largely encroached for urban infrastructure and as result, in the heart of the city only 17 good lakes exist as against 51 healthy lakes in 1985. Urban development has caused 16 lakes getting converted to bus stands, Golf courses, playgrounds and residential colonies, and few tanks were breached under the malaria eradication programme.
In recent years, the Management of Lakes traditionally done by the government agencies witnessed experimentation by the Lake Development Authority with a limited public–private sector participation in respect of three lakes, which has proved controversial and resulted in almost a reversal of the policy.
History.
The earliest history of creation of lakes in and around the city is traced to the founders of Bangalore or Bengaluru –the Kempe Gowdas– in the Sixteenth century and later by the Wodeyars of Mysore Kingdom and the British.
Most of the lakes and tanks were man made for purposes of drinking water, irrigation and fishing needs and they have also favorably influenced microclimate of the city. The lake waters have also served as “Dhobhi Ghats” or places where washer–men (‘dhobis’ is the locale usage in India), have traditionally used them as a means of livelihood for washing clothes and drying them. The lakes have also served to replenish ground water resources in the vicinity, which are tapped through wells for drinking water.
In the 1960s the number of tanks and lakes was 280 and less than 80 in 1993. Until 1895 unfiltered water was supplied from tanks like Dharmambudhi (present day Bus station), Millers tank (Area opposite Cantonment railway station), Sankey and Ulsoor tanks. From 1896 water was supplied from Hessarghtta and from 1933 it was also obtained from Thippagondanahalli. In the 1970s the scheme to pump water from the Cauvery river 100 kilometres away was begun. The water needed to be raised up by 500 metres.
The water demand in 2001 was 750 million litres per day and the actual supply is only 570 million litres per day and the per capita usage is about 105 litres per day. The national standard is 150 litres per day while the international standard is 200 litres per capita per day.
Encroachment of Lakes.
Most of the lakes have vanished due to encroachment and construction activity for urban infrastructure expansion. The city once had 280-285 lakes of which 7 cannot be traced, 7 are reduced to small pools of water, 18 have been unauthorisedly encroached by slums and private parties, 14 have dried up and are leased out by the Government. 28 lakes have been used by the Bangalore Development Authority to distribute sites and build extensions for residential areas. The remaining lakes are in fairly advanced state of deterioration.
Some of the major lakes that disappeared over the years are [http://bangalorebuzz.blogspot.com/2008/07/lakes-die-city-turns-dry.html][http://www.slideshare.net/das_gv/ruin-then-restore]:
Topography and Hydrology.
The topographic setting of the city has radial slopes towards east and west with a smooth ridge running north to south; rainfall over the ridge area gets divided and flows east or west into the three gentle slopes and valleys of Koramangala–Challagatta, Hebbal and Vrishabavathi. Doddabettahalli is the highest point on this ridge. These naturally undulating terrain of hills and valleys, lends itself perfectly to the development of lakes that can capture and store rainwater. Small streams are formed by each valley starting with the ridge at the top. A series of shallow tanks varying in size are developed. The gentle topography has also good potential of ground water development.
Water resources are important for urban areas as they provide for a wide range of uses. Bangalore, with annual rainfall of with three different rainy seasons covering nine months of the year. June to October is the rainy season accounting for 64% of the total annual rainfall in the S-W monsoon period and during the N–E monsoons (November – December.). It has a salubrious climate with an annual mean temperature of with extremes ranging from to . The streams between ridges and valleys have been dammed at suitable locations creating a cascade of reservoirs in each of the three valley systems. Each lake stores rain water from its catchments with excess flows spilling downstream into the next lake in the cascade. 
The storm water runs off through drains only. These drains often carry sewage in it, which results in the lakes getting polluted. Many lakes have reportedly springs at the bottom of the lakes, some of which are stated to be choked due to silt, which also feed the lakes.
The dependence on lakes, tanks, ponds, wells and other sources, in the past for supply of raw water to the city was de–linked with treated supplies arranged from river based schemes such as the "Chamarajendra Water Works" (Hesaraghatta Lake) built in 1894 and the "Chamarajasagar Reservoir" at T G Halli across the Arkavathy River in 1933 and subsequent sourcing from the Cauvery River schemes.
List of lakes.
Of the several freshwater lakes and water tanks, the notable are the Madiwala Lake, the Hebbal Lake, the Ulsoor Lake and the Sankey Tank.
Notable lakes in Bangalore are:
Other lakes in Bangalore are Allalasandra, Attur Lake, BTM Lake, Chinnappannahalli, Doddanekundi, Kalkere, Kowdenhalli, Keravanhalli, Karithimmanhalli, Kaikondanahalli, Kengeri, Kodigenahalli, Mahadevpura, Uttarahalli, Doraikere, Dipanjali, Malgan, Veerasandra and Yelahanka.
Status of two of the centrally located lakes, namely, the Ulsoor Lake and the Sankey tank, which have been restored by the Forest Department of the State, are elaborated in the following sections.
Flora and fauna.
The lakes in Bangalore are rich in flora and fauna (some species are pictured in the gallery) biodiversity.
Status of lakes.
The lakes of the city have been largely encroached for urban infrastructure, and as result, in the heart of the city only 17 good lakes exist as against 51 healthy lakes in 1985. According to a scientific study carried out by the Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES), Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, the water bodies of the city have reduced from 3.40 per cent () in 1973 to just about 1.47 per cent () in 2005 with built up area during the corresponding period increasing to 45.19 per cent () from 27.30 per cent (). The adverse results of such large change are reported to be:
A recent study says most of the bangalore lakes are toxic with very less dissolved oxygen.
Management.
Historically lakes in the Bangalore region were managed by a plethora of government agencies such as the Forest Department, Minor Irrigation Department, Horticulture Department, Public Works Department (PWD), Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP), Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), Tourism Department, City Municipal Councils and Panchayats; each organization claiming its own jurisdiction of ownership and maintenance rights resulting in a deficient, inconsistent and uncoordinated approach.
Expert Committees set up by the Karnataka Government, since 1986, highlighted the failure of the various bodies maintaining lakes in protecting them and also suggested that:.
A Public Interest Litigation was also filed in July 1985 citing the recommendations of the Expert Committee for implementation and the High Court duly directed the Government of Karnataka to take immediate steps for acting on the recommendations. The Government initiated action to establish a separate authority to address the problem of lakes and implement the recommendations of the Expert Committee and the Lake Development Authority was thus established in July 2002.
Lake Development Authority.
The Government of Karnataka, following the directive of The Honourable High Court of Karnataka and considering the unchecked deterioration of lakes in and around Bangalore and keeping in line with their critical role in maintaining healthy environs and recharging of ground water, set up the Lake Development Authority (LDA) in July 2002 as a registered society under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1959, as a non-profit organization and a para–statal body with a mandate of 
"working solely for the regeneration and conservation of lakes in and around Bangalore city within BMRDA jurisdiction in the first instance, would be extended to other parts of Karnataka subsequently."
The defined charter of functions of the LDA is:.
The LDA initially identified 2,789 large, medium and small lakes within Bangalore Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (BMRDA) limits including 608 within the limits of Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) to take remedial and restoration measures. The Authority sought financial support from various funding agencies to implement identified activities. Several organizations and funding agencies have been involved in restoration of lakes in Bangalore and the activity has been coordinated by the Lake Development Authority. The details are: 
Apart from the above lakes, LDA is coordinating lake restoration works, outside the Bangalore city, in other parts of the state with funding from the National Lake Conservation Programme (NLCP)
Privatization.
In 2004, the LDA began a process of "public-private participation" where private companies bid for the lakes to “develop and maintain” them for the next 15 years with the specified Terms of Reference. The tender specified the following Terms of Reference.
This was to be followed by beautification of lakes through: 
The following lakes were leased out to private parties; the Hebbal Lake to E.I.H, the Nagavara Lake to Lumbini Gardens and the Venkanayakere to ParC Ltd out of which the first two were initially allotted. 
In May 2006, LDA leased out the Hebbal Lake, one of the largest lakes in Bangalore, to East India Hotels (the Oberoi group) for a period of 15 years for an annual lease amount of Rs. 72,10,000 (about US$ 1.44 million) and an annual escalation of 1.5% in the amount and an Investment of Rs.16,75,00,000 (about US$0.34 million) with a security deposit of 1.5% (Rs.25,12,500 – about US$0,50million) under the Public-Private Partnership policy.
The Nagavara Lake was leased to Lumbini Gardens Pvt Ltd in April 2005 for a period of 15 years for an annual lease amount of Rs.4023,000 (about US $0.80 million) with an annual escalation of 1.5% of this amount every year for the 15–year lease period and with Investment of Rs.7,01,00,000 (about US$ 14.02 million) with a security deposit of 2% of this amount (Rs.14,20,000 – about US$0.284million).
As per the lease agreement, the above referred agencies were to carry out the development and maintenance of the lakes by:
Impact of privatization.
The social damage caused due to privatization, as reported by a researcher, are: 
Protests.
The above private sector activities have resulted in major protests from citizen groups. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests has been urged by 500 residents requesting for abandoning the programme of handing over lakes to privatization of lakes as they are developed as recreation focal points. Civil rights groups are in the fore front of these protests as they allege that the lake which is a Common Property Resource is illegally fenced off and thus only privileged few could access it While the private developer contends that the lake will be a unique recreational place, the others feel that the entry fee of Rs 20 per person would exclude the traditional users (farmers, fishing communities, cattle herders, washer–men, and casual workers) of the lake. Environmentalists mention that the lake’s wetland ecology sustained scores of water birds but it will soon become only a pretty hygienic bowl. Environmentalists also say that four types of vegetation in the ecosystem grow at different water depths, sustaining about 30 species of birds. Birds such as sandpipers and clovers will find the lake too deep once the lake is deepened by removing the silt. Deep water birds such as ducks and cormorants will be disturbed by boating.
LDA’s contention.
The Lake Development Authority contends that the organization is not adequately staffed and that they do not have the finances for maintaining lakes on an ongoing basis. Hence, the alternative is leasing out lakes to private parties.
Public interest litigation (PIL).
A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in 2008 by an Environmental Support Group (a Trust) and a public spirited individual of Bangalore in the High Court of Bangalore citing 16 respondents with the Lake Development Authority (LDA) as the second main respondent and the favoured respondents (at serial number 14,15 and 16) namely M/s Biota Natural Systems (I) Pvt. Ltd, M/s Lumbini Gardens Ltd., and M/s E. I. H. Limited, in respect of the ongoing privatisation of lakes/tanks in Bangalore. The PIL contends that:
PIL has sought redress from the Honorable High Court by way of issue of writ or order in the nature of Mandamus repealing the ‘Lease Deeds’ executed by Respondent (the LDA) in favour of the beneficiary respondents (to whom the lakes were leased – Respondents 14, 15 and 16) and requested the Court to direct the Government of Karnataka (as first Respondent) to ensure full compliance with the law and policies relating to protection and conservation of lakes/tanks/wetlands.
Policy turnaround.
With the privatization approach for development and management of lakes not proving to be popular, and considering the serious protests by the public and the pending Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the High Court of Karnataka seeking redress, the Government of Karnataka has now decided to make amends with a paradigm shift in its approach by declaring that the State Government would undertake, through its agencies such as the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), BBMP and Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA), the rejuvenation works of 27 lakes in the Phase I by allocating finances to the extent of Rs 1.5–2 crores (US$ 375,000 to 500,000) per lake which would involve:
The LDA has transferred 17 lakes to BBMP while rest of the lakes are now controlled by Karnataka Forest Department.

John Gordon (Conservative politician)

The Hon. John Edward Gordon (5 February 1850 – 19 February 1915) was a British Conservative Party politician.
The eldest son of Edward Gordon, Baron Gordon of Drumearn, a senior Scottish judge and Conservative politician, he was educated at Edinburgh Academy and the University of Edinburgh. In 1879 he married the daughter of John Snowdon Henry, former member of parliament for South East Lancashire. They had five children.
He was elected at the 1895 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Elginshire and Nairnshire, unseating the Liberal MP John Keay. He was re-elected in 1900, but did not defend the seat at the 1906 general election, By this time he had moved to the resort town of Hove on the south coast of England, and he stood instead in the local two-seat Brighton constituency. In 1907 his wife moved to Japan and she is buried on Mount Koya.
He came fourth, albeit in a close contest, and did not stand again until a by-election in June 1911. He was returned unopposed to fill the vacancy caused when sitting MP Walter Rice was elevated to the peerage on inheriting the title of Baron Dynevor. However, he resigned the seat three years later due to ill health, on 23 June 1914, by accepting the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead. 
He died in a nursing home in Bromley, Kent, in February 1915 aged 65.

Museum With No Frontiers

Museum With No Frontiers (MWNF), an international non-profit organization founded in 1995 as a result of the Barcelona Declaration by Eva Schubert, with the goal of launching a formal partnership between the European Union and its Mediterranean neighbours, which recently resulted in the constitution of the Union for the Mediterranean. It is the largest trans-national museum on the internet. MWNF's goal is to promote cooperation in the fields of cultural heritage, tourism and education. MWNF develops exhibition formats that do not require moving the artworks, but instead, museum artefacts, monuments and archaeological sites are presented in situ (Exhibition Trails) or in a virtual environment (the MWNF Virtual Museum). Within the programme coordinated by MWNF each country presents its history, art and culture from the local perspective. Over 500 partners from 21 countries participate in different projects. HRH Princess Sumayyah of Jordan is one of the members of the recently constituted MWNF Honorary Committee. MWNF was founded in Vienna, Austria, moved its operational office to Madrid, Spain in 1998 and is currently based in Brussels, Belgium. In May 2007, the involvement of the European Commission ended, and the museum became self-financed.
The Virtual Museum was launched by MWNF in 2007. The platform enables partners from different countries to present a joint theme from a shared perspective and to create virtual ensembles that would otherwise be impossible to realise. It also shows the role of Islam not only in the Mediterranean but also in Europe. The first section, www.discoverislamicart.org, was completed in 2005 in cooperation with partners from 14 countries. It’s Permanent Collection and Database comprises 850 artefacts as well as 385 monuments and archaeological sites from the Umayyad period (AD 132–750) until the end of the Ottoman Empire (1922). 18 Virtual Exhibitions present the history, art and cultural legacy of the great Islamic dynasties of the Mediterranean. Descriptions are available in Arabic, English, French and Spanish; for the Virtual Exhibitions furthermore also in German, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish and Swedish.
Exhibition Trail is the name of one of MWNF's other exhibition formats, authored by Eva Schubert. All items on display – museum artefacts, monuments and archaeological sites – are presented in situ, thus making moving the artworks unnecessary. Instead, the visitor discovers the artefacts on display in their natural environment. Each Exhibition Trail has an accompanying catalogue, designed and written by local experts of each country, and produced for use as a thematic guide during the visit. So far 15 Exhibition Trails have been launched in 11 countries offering a total of 164 thematic itineraries and turning 1,468 local museums, monuments and archaeological sites – to a large extent unknown to non-experts – into key elements of local development.

Living Human Project

The Living Human Project (LHP) is developing a worldwide, distributed repository of anatomo-functional data and of simulation algorithms relative to the human musculoskeletal apparatus, fully integrated into a seamless simulation environment and directly accessible by any researcher in the world. This infrastructure will be used to create the physiome of the human musculoskeletal system.
The Story so far.
This initiative started in 2002 as a result of the BioNet coordination action, aimed to establish the grand challenges for European biomechanics. The BioNet consensus document clearly pointed out the need for an Internet-based virtual community as a mean to share biomechanics data.
In 2003 a group of partners who were also involved with the BioNet action wrote a public document drafting a possible strategy to have the LHP started.
In the meanwhile Marco Viceconti, a researcher at the Rizzoli Institute in Bologna (Italy) started a voluntary effort called Biomechanics European Lab (BEL). The idea was to create a community of interested colleagues, who would develop the LHP without any centralised funding. 
In 2006 The BEL was merged with to Biomed Town, a new Internet community reserved to all those who have professional interest in biomedical research. The BEL data repository remains available on Biomed Town for historical reasons. 
It was evident that the most important limiting factor for LHP was the lack of an adequate information technology infrastructure. This need is now being matched by two separate provisions.
Living Human Digital Library.
A consortium of European institutions is developing the Living Human Digital Library, as part of the LHDL STRP project supported by the European Commission. This wiki page contains constantly updated information on the LHDL project.
The LHDL project will end in January 2009; soon after, the LHDL consortium will release a biomedical data management and sharing service, called Physiome Space. Physiome Space will make possible for single researchers as well as for large consortia to share with their peers very large collections of biomedical data, including medical imaging, computer simulations, etc. It is possible to sign up for the beta users group, which should start in the last quarter of 2008.
Biomed Town.
The users of LHP, e.g. all those research, industry, or clinical professionals that are interested in the musculoskeletal system in every possible way and at every dimensional scale, from the whole body down to the cell and the proteins, created a collaborative community within Biomed Town. The activities of the LHDL Consortium are hosted in the LHDL Building. The community consensus process takes place in the Living Human Square.

Amorpha fruticosa

Amorpha fruticosa is a species of flowering plant in the legume family (Fabaceae) known by several common names, including desert false indigo, false indigo-bush, and bastard indigobush. It is found wild in most of the contiguous United States, southeastern Canada, and northern Mexico, but it is probably naturalized in the northeastern and northwestern portion of its current range. The species is also present as an introduced species in Europe, Asia, and other continents. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant, and some wild populations may be descended from garden escapees.
"A. fruticosa" grows as a glandular, thornless shrub which can reach 5 or 6 meters in height and spread to twice that in width. It is somewhat variable in morphology. The leaves are made up of many hairy, oval-shaped, spine-tipped leaflets. The inflorescence is a spike-shaped raceme of many flowers, each with a single purple petal and ten protruding stamens with yellow anthers. The fruit is a legume pod containing one or two seeds.
6'-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-12a-hydroxydalpanol, a rotenoid, can be found in the fruits of "A. fruticosa".

John Kebty-Fletcher

John Robert Kebty-Fletcher (1869 - 12 July 1918) was a British Conservative politician.
Political career.
Active in Unionist politics, by 1900 Kebty-Fletcher was a member of Liverpool City Council. 
He stood at the 1906 General Election as Conservative candidate for Rossendale but lost to the Liberal, Lewis Harcourt. He was elected Member of Parliament for Altrincham at the December 1910 general election, gaining the seat from the Liberals. His profession was described as "provision merchant", and his address as "The Paddock", Hooton, Cheshire. As the Liberals were able to form a minority government with support from the Irish Parliamentary Party, Kebty-Fletcher found himself on the opposition benches. In May 1913 Kebty-Fletcher announced his immediate resignation from parliament by appointment as Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, causing a by-election.
Controversy.
In his short parliamentary career he was involved in two controversies. Firstly, in 1911, he made an attack on the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd-George accusing him of appointing a partner in his law firm to a government post. In 1913 he attacked the government over the Marconi scandal.

James Morrison (British politician)

Major James Archibald Morrison DSO (18 September 1873 – 27 October 1934) was a British Conservative Party politician.
Morrison was the son of Alfred Morrison, of Fonthill House, and the grandson of James Morrison. Hugh Morrison was his elder brother and Lord Margadale his nephew.
A rower and expert shot, Morrison became a second lieutenant in the 4th (Eton Volunteer) Battalion, Oxfordshire Light Infantry on 12 December 1891, and transferred to the 4th Middlesex Volunteer Rifle Corps on 15 May 1895. He transferred to the Grenadier Guards on 5 February 1895, and subsequently fought in the Second Boer War.
He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Wilton division of Wiltshire at an unopposed by-election in July 1900. He was re-elected at 1900 general election, but at the 1906 election he lost his seat to the Liberal Party candidate. In 1910, he inherited Basildon Park from his uncle Charles (son of James Morrison), and was elected MP for Nottingham East. He resigned the seat in 1912 by the procedural device of accepting the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead.
Morrison made major improvements to the Basildon estate, building new cottages and pumping stations to supply it with water. When the First World War broke out, he returned to the Grenadier Guards. Harold Macmillan served as a lieutenant under his command. Badly wounded at the Battle of the Somme, he was invalided out of the Army and turned over Basildon Park for use as a Guards' convalescent home. He was awarded the DSO in 1916.
Morrison sold off the Basildon estate to Sir Edward Iliffe in 1929 and died in 1934.

C-rich stability element

The C-rich stability element is a short part of a gene sequence important for the proper synthesis of globin and several other human proteins.
Differences in the stabilities of individual mRNAs can dramatically affect the overall level of expression for genes. Eukaryotic mRNAs can have half-lives that vary from as short as several minutes to as long as several days. In differentiating human erythroid cells the deposition of high levels of alpha globin protein is dependent on an unusually long half-life of the alpha globin mRNA (greater than 24hrs). The stability determinant for alpha globin mRNA has been mapped to a pyrimidine-rich segment of its 3' UTR. This region confers stability by directing the assembly of a specific alpha ribonucleoprotein complex at this site. Subsequently Holcik and Liebhaber identified three other highly stable eukaryotic mRNAs that assemble the alpha globin protein complex at homologous pyrimidine-rich regions within their 3'UTRs (rabbit lipoxygenase, rat tyrosine hydroxylase, and human alpha(I)-collagen).
There is some debate as to the number and identity of trans-acting factors recruited to the C-rich element. However the alpha globin poly(C)-binding protein (alphaCP) is agreed to be the core constituent of what is known as the alpha complex. A 39Kda protein, the alphaCP has been shown to bind directly to the C-rich RNA signal. There are two alphaCP, alphaCP1 and alphaCP2. Studies suggest the complex may protect a site near the C-rich element in the alpha globin mRNA from the erythroid endonuclease (ErEN). As many of the protein components necessary for alpha globin stability complex appear to be widely expressed across species and cell types this mechanism of mRNA stabilisation is likely to be a general one. However, in the mouse the cis and trans determinants have diverged to some extent. The mouse sequence requirements are equally C and U-rich compared to the predominantly C-rich human element. Despite this shift the murine alpha globin mRNA is still as stable due to a complementary change in the specificity of the poly(C)-binding protein.

<doc id="19041444" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19041444" title="Health and safety law">
Health and safety law

Health and safety law is a body of law that protects the health, safety and welfare of the general public and certain defined sectors of the population such as employees. Most jurisdictions have a framework of health and safety law which will usually be enforced by the state using an inspectorate, regulatory control and the criminal law.
The regulatory framework for health and safety will usually operate alongside a civil law system which would allow individuals to bring a lawsuit against a person, company or organization that may have been liable for personal injury or even death. Thus where an employee has been injured through an accident at work in the UK the Health & Safety Executive may instigate a criminal prosecution which may result in a financial penalty (fine) and now could result in imprisonment of those individuals responsible (Health and Safety {Offences} Act 2008)– however the injured employee can also seek damages for the injury caused in the civil courts under areas of civil law such as negligence and occupiers liability.
One example in the United States was the Station nightclub fire. In this incident, the Station nightclub caught fire on February 20, 2003, in West Warwick, Rhode Island, after the rock band Great White set off pyrotechnics which ignited the club’s highly flammable soundproofing. One hundred people, including one band member, died in the blaze. The band’s manager, Daniel Biechele, and club owners Jeffrey and Michael Derderian were each charged with 100 counts of involuntary manslaughter with criminal negligence and 100 counts of involuntary manslaughter in violation of a misdemeanor. Michael Derderian was sentenced to a four year jail sentence with eligibility for a work release program and Jeffrey Derderian received a suspended 10-year sentence and a community sentence while Biechele also received a prison sentence. In civil courts, more than $1 billion in claims have been made by the families of the dead and injured with defendants including the manufacturers of the soundproofing, the maker of the pyrotechnics, the band and the venue. 
The regulatory framework in the UK only began to develop towards the end of the industrial revolution and clearly employers and business at the time had a vested interest to oppose legislation and regulatory control which might affect their business. But progressive societies clearly wish to protect their population and workforce and almost all now have comprehensive legislation. In the United States the law developed in a similar manner. For example In 1891 Congress passed the first federal statute governing mine safety, marking the beginning of what was to be an extended evolution of increasingly comprehensive federal legislation regulating mining activities. The 1891 law was relatively modest legislation that applied only to mines in U.S. territories, and, among other things, established minimum ventilation requirements at underground coal mines and prohibited operators from employing children under 12 years of age. But many would say that after a golden age of health and safety legislation there is now a major problem as legislation and regulation often does nothing to actually protect the public and employees, and indeed has led to the development of a compensation culture.
In the United Kingdom the primary legislation governing the enforcement of health and safety is the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. Section 1 of the Act sets out the preliminary purposes of the act. These are for (i) securing the health, safety and welfare of persons at work and (ii) protecting others against risks to health and safety in connection with the activities of persons at work and (iii) for controlling and managing the use of dangerous substances and (iv) for controlling certain emissions into the atmosphere. 
The European Union has instigated a series of Directives in the field of health and safety which must be brought into domestic legislation by all the member countries within agreed time limits. Recent Directives cover noise at work, the manual handling of loads, carcinogens and biological agents.
A waste disposal, construction and demolition company has been fined £20,000 after an employee was run over by a dumper truck. The company pleaded guilty to contravening s2(1) of HSWA by failing to ensure the safety of an employee, it was also ordered to pay full costs of £6,580. Gloucester Crown Court was told that the incident occurred on 9 August 2004 at a waste transfer station in Gloucester, where rubbish is brought by skips and lorries for recycling or landfill. A dumper truck being driven out of the waste transfer station struck the man as he stood with his back to the doors, running him over and fracturing his pelvis and femur. The driver had been unable to see the supervisor, as the truck had a high load of wooden pallets in the bucket at the front, and he was coping with changes in light between the two areas. In mitigation, the company said it had put a lot of work and investment into health and safety since the incident. The court was told that this incident was the third for which the company had been prosecuted in the last two years. Its construction division was fined £5,000 in January 2005 after an untrained worker overturned a dumper truck while reversing it without wearing a seatbelt, breaking his leg. Its demolition division was fined £12,500 in September 2005 after an untrained and unsupervised operative fell through a fragile roof.

Gerard William "Jerry" Ford (October 2, 1924 – August 24, 2008) was an American businessman who founded Ford Modeling Agency with his wife Eileen Ford in 1946 in their apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City.
Life.
Ford was born October 2, 1924, in New Orleans, Louisiana. One of six children of John William and Ermine Ford, Ford graduated high school and became a boxer and football player at Notre Dame (his roommate was Johnny Lujack, a Heisman Trophy winner), before transferring to midshipman school at Columbia University as part of his service with the United States Navy during World War II. His wife, then Eileen Otte, was studying at Barnard College and was, herself, briefly a model. The couple met and eloped in 1944 while Mr. Ford was waiting to ship out with the Navy.
Career.
In 1945, after completing his Naval service aboard a supply ship based in the Pacific Theater of Operations, Ford returned to his home and wife in New York. He resumed his studies in accounting at Columbia University, while Mrs. Ford worked as a secretary for several of her friends, also models, and eventually became their informal agent. When she became pregnant, she left active work and he stepped in to manage the business.
Prior to Ford's innovations, models generally handled their own bookings and billing individually. In the 1970s, Ford created the first contracts for models to represent specific brands exclusively, securing higher fees for the models. He negotiated the first such contract for Lauren Hutton to represent Revlon in 1974.
At the time of his death, he resided in Oldwick, New Jersey. He died in Morristown, New Jersey at age 83. The cause of his death was complications from endocarditis.
His daughter is Katie Ford.

His father Thomas Keswick, from Dumfriesshire had married Jardine's niece and daughter of Jean, Margaret Johnstone, and entered the Jardine business. The company operated as merchant traders and had a major influence in the Opium Wars although the company stopped this trading in 1870 to pursue a broad range of trades including shipping, railways, textiles and property development.
William arrived in China and Hong Kong in 1855, the first of six generations of the Keswick family to be associated with Jardines. He established a Jardine Matheson office in Yokohama, Japan in 1859. He returned to Hong Kong to become a partner of the firm in 1862. He became managing partner or Tai-pan of the firm in 1874 until his departure in 1886. He left Hong Kong in 1886 to take control of Matheson & Co. in London responsible only to the firm's senior partner Sir Robert Jardine (1825–1905). He remained the firm's managing director until his death in 1912. Keswick also served as a director in the Hudson Bay Company.
He spent three spells on the Legislative and Executive Councils of Hong Kong between 1868 and 1887.
He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Epsom at a by-election in 1899, and held the seat until his resignation on 8 March 1912 by the procedural device of accepting the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead.
His grandson, William Johnston Keswick "Tony" (1903–1990) was Jardine's Tai-pan between 1934 and 1941.
