Origins.
In 1966, a group of musicians were attempting to put together a performance of Handel's "Messiah". While this performance never happened, it was the genesis of what became the Bronx Opera. Michael Spierman, a recent graduate of New York University's University Heights campus in The Bronx (now Bronx Community College of the City University of New York) took the hub of the group that was to perform the Handel and combined it with his intention to form an opera company that would be based at the Bronx NYU campus. This organization was to be known as the "Heights Opera." It was as the Heights Opera Company that the group first performed on November 24, 1967, at Vladeck Hall of the Amalgamated Housing Corporation. The opera was Mozart's "Così fan tutte".

History
Pyzowka (or Sreniawa as it was also known) has historically been one of the outlying villages that form the royal demesne of Nowy Targ, comprising 37 villages and the town of Nowy Targ (translates as new market).
Pyzowka was first settled in the late 16th century when the Pieniazek family administered the Nowy Targ demesne. The family claimed payment for settling the village in 1616. Minakowski's Wielka Genealogia (6) states that Jan Pieniazek z Kruzlowej (approx 1540 - 1602) was the dziedzic (heir)of Pyzowka and Wroblowka (another highland village) . His mother, Anna Pukarzowska, carried the Sreniawa coat of arms (Polish crests all have individuals names) which may have given rise to the village's alternative name. 
According to Krzeptowski and Krzeptowskavillage was established by Mateusz (Matthew) Pyza,  who was the brother of Piotr Czerwinski, "Soltys" (Elder) in the neighbouring, and much older, village of Klikuszowa. The first written document that mentions the Pyzowka (using its earlier name of Sreniawa) is a court record of 1604 noting a dispute involving a village resident called Tomasz Gomolka[2. The next recorded document, dated 1606, notes that Mikolaj Matiowicz[3was re-affirmed in his role as "Soltys "of Pyzowka/Sreniawa that year. Kreptowski and Krzeptowska  note that Matiowicz (a patronymic that likely means son of Mateusz) was the eldest son of Mateusz Pyza. The different surnames recorded for father and son would not have been unusual in 16th-century Poland when surnames were neither fixed (people would commonly use several which might include a patronymic, a place of origin,a nickname, a parents surname or a house name (name associated with the individual’s plot of land or house) nor inherited as a rule. 
The Soltyship (which in the 16th century typically gave its holder the privilege both to own land and assign land to settlers in exchange for corvee labour) did not then pass to Matiowicz’s offspring (Krzeptowski does not record him having any children or a wife), but was passed on to his brother Jakub Pyza Sreniawa, to use the name recorded in a document dated 1611. In this document Jakub Pyza Sreniawa’s daughter Dorota, is described as Soltys (female) of Sreniawa (“Soltyska Sreniawska”) and leaves money and goods to her second husband Filip Fornalik.  
Village Name
Pyzowka is considered an example of the phenomenon of a village name given by an administrator  being usurped by a popular name. As noted in the history section the village originally was given the name Sreniawa, as recorded in several early documents. Adamczyk suggests that this was in tribute to the powerful Sreniawit family (which like the Pukarzowskis (see above) carries the Szreniawa/Sreniawa coat of arms). The village’s first  Soltys, who would have been the settlement’s  major landholder with the task of growing it, was, however, known by the surname/nickname  Pyza (pudgy of face) and it appears the Polish possessive form of that name, Pyzowka (meaning Pyza’s place), became commonly used for the entire settlement.
An early document from 1611 refers to Dorota,‘"soltyska sreniawska" ’ (Soltys of Sreniawa) and identifies her as ‘dziewka Jakuba Pyza Sreniawy (daughter of Jacob Pyza Sreniawa). But, as noted in the History section,  in 1606 an official document already referred to both Pyzowka and Sreniawa and subsequent Soltyship holders are referred to as Dorota and Filip Pyzowscy (a possessive which can refer to either the village name or their parents’ name ). It is clear from parish records that a branch of this Soltys family retained the surname Pyzowski (and moved to the nearby town of Nowy Targ) while another branch reverted to the surname Czerwinski (remaining in Pyzowka) that was used by the same clan (polish - "rod") when still resident in the older village of Klikuszowa (the History section describes the original settlement of Pyzowka by the brother of Piotr Czerwinski, Jakub ‘Pyza’) .
Given that there are no other villages of the name Pyzowka in Poland,  it is possible that all living persons of the surname Pyzowski(a) may be related to Jakub Pyza.  The legal/socail estate status of the Pyzowski family remains unclear. One document refers to the Pyzowskis as szlachetni (noble) but other documents make no mention of this status.  The Gajl Polish heraldic text http://gajl.wielcy.pl/herby_nazwisko_herby.php records the name Pyzowski but shows no coat of arms recorded for the family.  
Academic Studies
Pyzowka is unusual in Poland in being the focus of several academic studies and surveys.  
The earliest was carried out in 1947 – 1949 by the Instytut Ekonomiki Rolnej ( Institute of Agricultural Economics) under the direction of Professor Boguslaw Galeski. The surveys covered every farm in the village and described the extreme poverty of the inhabitants. The surveys are retained by the IER in Warsaw.  
An historical study of archives relating to the village was carried out in 1972 by Professor Mieczyslaw Admaczyk. The unpublished manuscript contains transcripts of archival material dating from 1767. A copy is held in the village.
In the 1970s Dr F. Pine and T. Bogdanowicz carried out socio-anthropological fieldwork in the village that included observer participation for two years as well as an analysis of parish records, historical archives and door to door surveys of village households. Dr Pine’s doctoral thesis is held at the University of London and the London School of Economics. 
Wieslaw Parzygant, the current village  Soltys (Elder), is recording personal histories of village residents notably biographies of the much decorated Polish war hero Franciszek Rola (also known as Wladylaw Smereczynski), and his brother, the village Soltys and social activist Jan Rola, recipient of Poland’s highest civil honour, the Gold Cross of Merit. The biographies are published on the village website.   
Jozef Krzeptowski and Maria Jasinek Krzeptowska have devoted a section of their comprehensive Genealogies of the Soltys Families of the Podhale to Pyzowka. They provide a detailed genalogy of the Pyza, Sreniawa, Pyzowski, Czerwinski clan. The full text can be ordered from http://krzeptowski.pl/wydawnictwo/

Abel Hermant

Abel Hermant (3 February 1861 – 29 September 1950) was a French novelist, playwright, essayist and writer, and member of the Académie française.
Life and career.
Hermant was born in Paris, the son of an architect. He received a degree from the École Normale Supérieure in 1880, and published his first volume of verse in 1883, "The Contempt". After several youthful novels, he moved to ironic analysis of the popular mores of the Belle Époque and achieved popular success. His first semi-autobiographical novel, "Monsieur Rabosson" of 1884, established his reputation as a satirical social observer. Its follow-up "Le Cavalier Miserey" of 1887, dealt with the issue of homosexuals in the military.
Between 1901 and 1937 Hermant embarked on a series of 20 linked novels with the general title "Memoirs to Serve for a History of Society", but his contributions to literature included many popular plays, drama criticism for "Le Figaro" and "Gil Blas", and a series of grammarian articles for "Le Temps" under the name "Lancelot" defending the purity of the French language.
By 1899 Hermant was well-connected in society; for instance he was the guest of Anna de Noailles at Évian-les-Bains, where he became friends with Marcel Proust. After a number of tries Hermant was elected to the Académie française on 30 June 1927.
During World War II Hermant's contributions to Jean Luchaire's pro-Nazi evening daily "Les Nouveaux Temps", beginning in 1940, his open support of the Vichy regime, and his criticisms of the French Army, marked him as a collaborator. Over 80 years of age, he was sentenced to life in prison on 15 December 1945. Hermant achieved the negative distinction of being one of the four "immortals" removed from the Académie française after World War II for collaboration with Germany. Hermant and Abel Bonnard were expelled outright, in disgrace; Charles Maurras of Action Française and Marshall Philippe Pétain had their seats declared vacant and were not replaced until their deaths.
Pardoned and released in 1948, Abel Hermant tried to justify his conduct during the Occupation in his "Thirteenth Notebook". He died shortly thereafter.

Waksmund is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Nowy Targ, within Nowy Targ County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It lies approximately east of Nowy Targ and south of the regional capital Kraków.
The village has a population of 2,439.
History.
The current village was settled by German immigrants under Magdeburg Law in the years 1334-1338. Previously, a village under the name Wilcze Pole or "Wolf's Field" existed. 
During the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 the village became famous for sending five armed men to fight on the side of King Władysław II Jagiełło for which the village received land in the nearby Tatra Mountains - Hala Waksmundzka (Meadow of Waksmund) and Dolina Waksmundzka (Valley of Waksmund) near Morskie Oko.
During the Second World War, on June 29th, 1943 the village was the site of one of the worst massacres carried out by the Nazi occupiers in the Podhale region, after the break-up of the Tatra Confederation revealed that many members of the resistance organization were from this village.
Geography.
Waksmund lies at an elevation of 565 metres primarily on the south bank of the river Dunajec in a hollow between two fossil sandar from the ice age. On the north bank of the Dunajec the land rises abruptly into the Gorce Mountains, on the south bank it slopes much gentler further south until it reaches the foothills of the Tatra Mountains some 6 to 8 kilometres further to the south near Białka Tatrzańska. The westernmost outlier of the Pieniny range, Gisowa Skała, lies a few kilometres to the southeast of the village near to Gronków. 
Within twenty kilometres of Waksmund, three national parks can be found: Gorczański, Tatrzański and Pieniński National Park. 
Climate.
On average, Waksmund has a fairly similar climate to other places in lower Podhale, although slightly colder - average annual temperature is around 5.6°C, with the warmest month, July, averaging 16.5°C, and the coldest month, January, averaging -6.2°C, placing it firmly within the Dfb climate zone. Annual precipitation is around 850 millimetres, annual sunshine hours around 1500. Snow remains on the ground on average 111 days per year, and the average length of the growing season is 189 days. Spring sees large diurnal ranges - it can be up to 20°C during mid day, while in the meanwhile at night it can still cool down to -10°C. Winter temperatures however, are among the coldest in the whole of Poland due to the unique geography which causes the area to function quite like a cold sink; -35°C is not unheard of on calm and clear nights above a fresh snow cover during a cold spell, and an unofficial all-time record low of -49°C was reported in the winter of 1929. Whether this is valid or due to faulty equipment can never be known, fact is that Waksmund on such nights can be 5 to 7°C colder than nearby Nowy Targ or Białka Tatrzańska. A similar effect, although far more pronounced, happens at Funtensee in Germany. The opposite has also known to happen, the area is especially susceptible to foehn winds, known locally as halny which can come from both the south as well as the north here, and rising air temperatures with as much as 15°C in a matter of an hour, accompanied by low humidity and strong winds. Summers are mild, with average highs around 20 to 25°C, and nighttime lows around 10°C.

Ron Davies (photographer)

Ron Davies, OBE (17 December 1921 – 26 October 2013) was a Welsh photographer.
Early life.
Davies was born in Aberaeron, Wales. He developed an interest in photography at the age of 8, while working as an errand boy for a chemist shop in his home town.
War years and motorcycle accident.
During WWII, Davies became an official war photographer on the staff of Air Information with the South East Asia command of the Royal Air Force, stationed in India, Indonesia and Singapore. In 1950, Davies was injured in an accident on his motorcycle combination, and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life, though this didn't prevent him pursuing his chosen career.
Career.
Davies worked as a still and cine press photographer for HTV, the BBC, the Western Mail, Y Cymro and various national newspapers, and produced much private work and mounted many exhibitions. He also took a keen and active interest in teaching photography, and was the driving force behind the first mobile disabled darkroom, operated by Arts Care/Gofal Celf.
In 2003, Davies was awarded the OBE for his services to photography, and the year before he was accepted into the Welsh National Eisteddfod's Bardic Circle.
Ron maintained an un-dimmed enthusiasm for photography throughout his entire life, and during his eighties, embraced digital darkroom techniques and digital printing, although he always maintained that he never lost the sense of wonder he felt when he saw his first black-and-white print appearing in a dish of developer under a safelight.
Death.
Davies died on 26 October 2013, aged 91.

Sebastiaan Bremer

Sebastiaan Bremer (born 27 June 1970 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch artist who lives and works in New York City.
Bremer turns photographs, found or snapped, of himself and his family into trippy, dusty memories that reveal the subconscious and the real world in one blink of an eye. He invents a poetic braille made up of text, personal symbols and ghostly shapes that, when integrated with their complex grounds, disappear again, buried in a sea of suspended dots. By slowly and laboriously painting on top of quickly taken snapshots, Bremer slows down time to render a hauntingly beautiful interior landscape.
Work.
Bremer attended the open studio program at the Vrije Academie in The Hague from 1989 until 1991. During his early years he meticulously reproduced personal photographs in paint. He received the Werkbeurs Grant from FBKVB in Holland and moved to New York in 1992 where he began to work primarily in black and white, reemphasizing his connection to photography. In 1994 he had his first solo show at Galerie Reisel, Holland and began exhibiting in as well as curating group shows. He was assistant to several artists in New York, and worked on production for the photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin from 1996 until 2000. In 1998 he produced Liza May Post's 'Trying' film and photograph. In that same year he attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine where he began experimenting with murals, collage paintings, and began drawing directly on photographs, the style which he continues to use today. In 1999 he finished his first large scale Ink on C-Print drawing entitled 10 AM-PM. In 2001 he had a solo debut, 'Veronica' at Roebling Hall, New York. His work is part of several important collections in the US and abroad, including the Victoria & Albert Museum, The MoMA, Zabludowicz Trust, the Rabobank collection and Lodeveans Contemporary LLP.
A new solo exhibition of his work opened May 2, 2008 in Galerie Barbara Thumm, Berlin. Currently he is working on a small edition of jewelry with Moritz Glik for Karen LaGatta editions, a commission for the Rabobank in Holland and new works for various upcoming groupshows, as well as an upcoming soloshow at Mia Sundberg Galleri in Stockholm.

La Maison du chat-qui-pelote

La Maison du chat-qui-pelote (At the Sign of the Cat and Racket) is a novel by Honoré de Balzac. It is the opening work in the "Scènes de la vie privée" ("Scenes of Private Life"), which comprises the first volume of Balzac's "La Comédie humaine".
First entitled "Gloire et Malheur" ("Glory and Misfortune"), this short novel was written in 1829 and published by Mame-Delaunay in 1830. The first edition was followed by four revised editions. The final edition, published by Furne in 1842, appeared under the title of "La Maison du chat-qui-pelote" and was itself corrected indefinitely.
Plot.
The artist Théodore de Sommervieux falls in love with Augustine Guillaume, the daughter of a conservative cloth merchant, whose house of business on the Rue Saint-Denis in Paris is known by sign of the Cat and Racket. Théodore, a winner of the Prix de Rome and a knight of the Legion of Honor, is famous for his interiors and chiaroscuro effects in imitation of the Dutch School. He makes an excellent reproduction of the interior of the Cat and Racket, which is exhibited at the Salon alongside a strikingly modern portrait of Augustine. The affair blossoms with the help of Madame Guillaume's younger cousin Madame Roguin, who is already acquainted with Théodore. The lovers become engaged, somewhat against the best wishes of Augustine's parents, who had originally intended her to marry Monsieur Guillaume's clerk Joseph Lebas. In 1808 Augustine marries Théodore at the local church of Saint-Leu; on the same day her elder sister Virginie marries Lebas.
The marriage is not a happy one. Augustine adores Sommervieux but is incapable of understanding him as an artist. Although she is more refined than her parents, her education and social standing leave her too far below the level of her husband to allow a meeting of minds to take place. Théodore's passion for her cools and she is treated with disdain by his fellow artists. Théodore instead finds a kindred soul in the Duchesse de Carigliano, to whom he gives the famous portrait of Augustine and to whom he becomes hopelessly attached, neglecting his rooms on the Rue des Trois-Frères (now a part of the Rue Taitbout).
Realizing after three years of unhappiness that her marriage is falling apart and having been informed by a malicious gossip of Théodore's attachment to the duchess, Augustine visits Madame de Carigliano not to ask her to give her back her husband's heart but to learn the arts by which it has been captured. The duchess warns her against trying to conquer a man's heart through love, which will only allow the husband to tyrannize over the wife; instead a woman must use all the arts of coquetry that nature puts at her disposal. Augustine is shocked to learn that Madame de Carigliano sees marriage as a form of warfare. The duchess then returns to Augustine her own portrait, telling her that if she cannot conquer her husband with this weapon, she is not a woman.
Augustine, however, does not understand how to turn such a weapon against her husband. She hangs the portrait in her bedroom and dresses herself exactly as she appears in it, believing that Théodore will see her once again as the young woman he fell in love with at the sign of the Cat and Racket. But when the artist sees the portrait hanging in her bedroom and asks how it came to be there, she foolishly reveals that it was returned to her by the Duchesse de Carigliano. "You demanded it from her?" he asks. "I did not know that she had it", replies Augustine. Théodore realizes that his wife is incapable of seeing the painting as he sees it - a consummate work of art. Instead of falling in love with its subject, he regards its return as a slap in the face from his mistress. His vanity wounded, he throws a fit and destroys the portrait, vowing vengeance upon the duchess.
By morning Augustine has become resigned to her fate. Her loveless marriage comes to an end eight years later when she dies of a broken heart at the age of twenty-seven.

Troop density

A troop density () also known as the "dispersion factor" in military science is a statistical value assigned by commanders during the combat operations process in considering the ability of the Combat Arms to achieve military objectives during a military operation. It reflects combat readiness of the units to participate in engagements with consideration to the terrain and expected enemy strength. 
The unit of measurement is square metres per soldier, although this is modified for each combat arm to reflect their primary weapon performance in combat as weapon density (); for example guns for artillery. Troop density is also used to estimate forces required to occupy a given populated territory in order to deny this population to being exploited by the enemy covert forces or insurgent troops.
The troop density has decreased through military history in proportion to the increase in lethality of weapons being use in combat. However, there is no accepted standard to calculate this value due to the large number of variables involved in the planning of combat operations. 
Military history can be divided into three periods according to "average troop density" employed in combat: ancient armies with about 10 square metres per foot soldier, the age of close order formation armed with firearms encompassing the period from the 1650s to the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 that increased the average to 250 square meters per infantryman, and the Second World War when the density decreased to 27,500 square metres per infantryman. The Soviet Army has based much of its post-war doctrine on the war experience, and had devoted considerable resources to the analysis of troop density, including these in almost all considerations of wartime operations. By the end of the Cold War the density (in Europe) was estimated to be 50,000 square metres per infantryman due to widespread mechanisation of forces.
Troop density was included in the doctrine of the First World War belligerents, based on the battalion per forward zone front calculation. The density of troops also affects the planning of close air support operations because of the higher rate of missions required to deliver adequate munitions to their targets. The increased dispersal of troops was the consideration behind the decision to develop nuclear bombs before effects of radiation were realised. 
The physical density of troops in the area of combat is not reflective of the average value for any given command because dispersion of troops tends to follow terrain and tactical considerations of the combat planning, and actual location of troops tends to be in clusters of positions. Low troop density is a particular problem as a period of vulnerability during air assault, air landing, amphibious assault and to some extent airborne assault operations, as well as during pre-combat concentration of troops in the staging area prior to their movement to the battle area, denying them operational mobility.

Decoy (film)

Decoy is a 1946 American film noir. Directed by Jack Bernhard, the film stars Jean Gillie, Edward Norris, Robert Armstrong, Herbert Rudley, Sheldon Leonard and Marjorie Woodworth. The film was produced by Jack Bernhard and Bernard Brandt as a Jack Bernhard Production, with a screenplay by Ned Young, based on an original story by Stanley Rubin
Decoy is a showcase of how film noir can do so much with so little. Short-lived Jean Gillie stars as one of the film genre's toughest femme fatales. Gillie was married to Bernhard when this film was made.
Plot.
The story picks up in Margot Shelby's apartment, as she is dying from a gunshot wound. Police detective Joe Portugal arrives at the scene to hear her last moments and possible confession. Margot recounts all the events that lead to Dr. Lloyd Craig shooting her shortly after arriving at her apartment. Via flash-back, we travel back to the beginning:
Margot's boyfriend was gangster Frankie Olins. Frankie robbed a bank and got away with around $400,000. He hid the money in a safe place before being arrested by the police. Since Frankie accidentally killed a guard during the robbery, he has been sentenced to death in the gas chamber. Frankie has never disclosed the location of the buried money to anyone.
Margot, in order to get both Frankie out of prison and her hands on the money, pretends to be in love with another gangster, Jim Vincent. She promises to share the stolen money with him if she can get Frankie to disclose the location. To this end, Vincent is recruited to fund Frankie's defense, and later, his possible resurrection from execution. In order to counter-act the effects of cyanide poisoning, Margot recruits the help of Dr. Lloyd Craig, the prison physician. They subsequently "steal" Frankie's body from the prison morgue.
Once Frankie is revived, he draws a map to the location of the buried loot for Margot, but on handing it to her, keeps half of the map for himself. Now that Vincent and Margot have the location, Margot encourages Vincent to shoot Frankie and take his half of the map. With Frankie truly dead, Margot, Vincent, and Dr. Craig now must be able to get out of the city.
Since police detective Portugal is aware of both Margot and Vincent's possible involvement in the dead convicts body disappearing, they determine to use doctor Craig and his car.
Since Dr. Craig's license plates will get them through any police roadblock, they force the reluctant Dr. Craig to drive them out of hiding to look for the money. Vincent's plan is to kill Dr. Craig once they leave town, but Margot has a plan of her own. She flattens a tire and tricks Vincent into fixing the flat. As he is lowering the car from the tire jack, she runs him over, killing him. She now forces Dr. Craig, at gunpoint, to dig up the buried money. Once she has the money box, she shoots Dr. Craig, leaving him for dead. However, he survives the gunshot and subsequently follows her to her apartment, where he shoots her as an act of revenge thus bringing the story to the present.
As Margot finishes her her story to detective Portugal, she dies. Portugal opens the money box only to find a single dollar bill wrapped in a note from Frankie, stating that he did not intend to leave any money to a double-crosser.
Reception.
Critical response.
Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing, "Jack Bernhard directs a darkly atmospheric but disjointed film noir that is rife with plot inconsistencies. The film's main virtue is the sinister performance by British newcomer Jean Gillie as Margot Shelby, who is the nonredeemable femme fatale with a history of using men and even resorting to violence to achieve her ends. Gillie is one of the more cruel femme fatales in film noir lore."
Film critic Glenn Erickson liked the film, writing, "After 1978 "Decoy" rarely or never appeared on television or in museum screenings. In 2000 the American Cinematheque showed it with the writer of its original story, Stanley Rubin, in attendance. The movie brought the house down with its odd mix of melodrama, hardboiled gimmicks and unrestrained sadism. I thought then that, as far as violence goes, Decoy was to 1946 what "Pulp Fiction" is to 1994."

Sąsiadka is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Sułów, within Zamość County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It lies approximately south-west of Sułów, west of Zamość, and south of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 500.
Currently Sasiadka is a small village, located at the edge of the Roztocze, but its history is very long, dating back to the early Middle Ages. Next to contemporary village lies an ancient Slavic gord, which was one of most important administrative centers of the so-called “Cherven Towns” (“Grody Czerwienskie”), a historic region between Poland and Rus’. 
Due to extensive archaeological research, which began in 1936, the gord of Sasiadka is one of the best known of all such locations in eastern Poland. According to archaeologists, Sasiadka was three times completely destroyed, and each time a new gord was established on the ruins of the previous one. Most likely, the gord was founded by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, who in 1034 - 1039 built a fortified settlement called Sutiejsk, which guarded the border with Poland. 
In 1069, Sutiejsk was captured by Boleslaw Smialy, during his raid over Rus’. The gord was burned, and quickly rebuilt by Poles, who controlled it until late 11th century. Sutiejsk was a very important trade and administrative center, with several meetings of Polish and Rus dukes taking place here. 
Some time between 1086 and 1097, Poles returned the gord to the Volhynian Duke Dawid Igorewicz, who visited it several times, as archaeologists found five lead seals with his name on them. Polish rulers remained keenly interested in Sutiejsk, and in 1121, Boleslaw Krzywousty captured it during his raid over Volhynia and Ruthenia. Sutiejsk was once again destroyed and rebuilt, and used as a military base for further Polish raids. At that time, its total area was 21 hectares, divided into three parts, with a walled center, the seat of a local duke. Three rings of ramparts, which protected the gord, were up to six meters high, and several hundred meters in circumference. 
Sutiejsk was finally destroyed in 1205, when Duke of Volodymyr Roman raided Polish-controlled territories. The gord was rebuilt, but in 1241, during the Mongol invasion of Poland, it was probably burned to the ground, never to be rebuilt. Also, in the 13th century, ancient East - West trade route, which went through Sutiejsk, lost its importance, and was replaced by the one which goes from Krakow to Przemysl and Lwow/Lviv. 
The village of Sasiadka remained a private property, since 1605 until 1944 part of the Zamoyski Family Fee Tail

History.
The first mention of the town was made in the census of 1564 as Biała Wolia. It was founded in the first half of the 16th century, by Nicolas of Leipzig, a member of Clan Korczak and nephew of Dymitr of Goraj. In 1631 the town was sold to the Zamoyski family, whereupon it was incorporated into the possessions of the Zamoyski magnate.
World War II.
During the Nazi occupation of Poland, several nearby villages were colonized by ethnic Germans. Though well-guarded by German soldiers, colonists were nevertheless attacked often by Polish militia groups. The Nazis retaliated against any group found to be aiding and abetting the militias.
After an attack in the nearby village of Lipsko, Nazi soldiers looted Białowola in retaliation for rendering aid to the guerillas. 51 people were killed, including 22 women and 12 children aged 8 months to 10 years. 
Today a monument exists at the site of the mass grave. Its inscription reads:
The Nazis went on to kill 14 more residents during the course of occupation.

List of Ottoman post offices in Palestine

The List of Ottoman post offices in Palestine contains those post offices operated in Palestine during Ottoman rule. The establishment of a new imperial postal system in 1834 and development of the transportation network resulted in vast improvements in the transport and communications systems. International and domestic post offices were operated by the Ottoman administration in almost every large city in Palestine, including Acre, Haifa, Safed, Tiberias, Nablus, Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Gaza.
The Imperial edict of 12 Ramasan 1256 (14 October 1840) led to substantial improvements in the Ottoman postal system and a web of prescribed and regular despatch rider ("tatar") routes was instituted. Beginning in 1841, the Beirut-route was extended to serve Palestine, going from Beirut via Damascus and Acre to Jerusalem.
Postal services were organized at the local level by the provincial governors and these leases ("posta mültesimi") came up for auction annually in the month of March. It is reported that in 1846 Italian businessmen Santelli and Micciarelli became leaseholders and ran a service from Jerusalem to Ramle, Jaffa, Sûr, and Saida.
By 1852, a weekly service operated from Saida via Sûr, Acre (connection to Beirut), Haifa, and Jaffa to Jerusalem, also serving Nablus beginning in 1856. That same year, two new routes came into operation: Jerusalem–Hebron–Gaza, and Tiberias–Nazareth–Chefa Omer–Acre. In 1867, the Jerusalem-Jaffa route operated twice a week, and beginning in 1884, the Nablus-Jaffa route received daily despatches.
Initially all the postal facilities had the status of relay stations, and letters received their postmarks only at the Beirut post office. In contradiction to that rule, a small number of markings "Djebel Lubnan" have been discovered: these are believed by philatelists to have been applied by a relay station at Staura (Lebanon). In the 1860s, most relay stations were promoted to the status of branch post offices and received postmarks, initially only negative seals, of their own. The postmarks of an office's postal section usually contained the words "posta shubesi", as opposed to "telegraf hanei" for the telegraph section. In 1860 ten postal facilities worked in Palestine, rising to 20 in 1900 and 32 in 1917.
Ottoman post offices.
A number of post offices are only known from archival material such as proof strikes of postmarks in Turkish PTT archives or lists prepared by the Ottoman Post for the UPU before 1914. Philatelists have so far not recorded any genuinely used postmarks or other postal material for these postal facilities:
Travelling post offices.
Travelling post offices existed on three routes:
No TPO postmarks are known for other railway lines operating during this period, irrespective of whether these lines actually did transport mail. Lines operating were (year of completion): Acre–Beled esh-Shech (1912), Afule–Djennine (1913), Djennine–Messudshi (1914), Messudshi–Tulkarem–Ludd (1915), Wadi Sarrar–Et-Tine–Beersheba, Beersheba–Hafir (1915), Et-Tine–Gaza (1916), and Deir el-Balah–Beersheba (1916).

Llagas-Uvas is an unincorporated, census county division (CCD) located on the eastern side of the Santa Cruz Mountains in southwest Santa Clara County, California. The area covers approximately , much of it open space, and contains the Uvas and Chesbro reservoirs, as well as the Calero, Uvas Canyon, Rancho Cañada del Oro, and Mount Madonna county parks.
As a result of the favorable Mediterranean climate, there are many wineries in the area, including Jason-Stephens, Sycamore Creek, Martin Ranch, Hecker Pass, Fernwood Cellars, Fortino, Kirigin, Sarah, and Rancho de Solis. There are also several equestrian centers in the area, including Calero Ranch Stables, Cevalo Riding Academy, Five Star Farms, Great Strides, Hidden Creek, Legacy Oaks, and Bodfish Creek Ranch.
As of the 2010 US Census, the population was 4,014 residents of whom 67.1% were non-Hispanic white, 20.1% Hispanic, 8.5% Asian, and 4.3% of other races, with a median age of 45.5 years old. As of 2009, the median income was $104,378 and median home price $991,773.
Apart from the community of Sveadal, most residents and businesses in the area use postal zip codes from neighboring cities of Morgan Hill, San Martin, or Gilroy. The telephone area code is 408.
History.
In Spanish, the word "uva" means "grape" and "llaga" means "wound".
The region was well known to Indian and European settlers for its abundance of wild grapes. The Uvas Creek was named after the land grant Cañada de las Uvas ("grape ravine"). This creek feeds into the Uvas Reservoir.
During the 19th century, Mexican land grants for Rancho Las Uvas, Rancho Ojo del Agua de la Coche, Rancho Solis and Rancho San Francisco de las Llagas were allocated in the area. Rancho San Francisco de las Llagas in the northern part was named after Las Llagas de Nuestro Padre San Francisco ("the wounds of Our Father Saint Francis"). The main creek that runs through the ranch was named Llagas Creek.
In 1955, the Chesbro reservoir was formed by damming the Llagas creek, to ensure adequate water supply for the surrounding farms and growing population of nearby Morgan Hill.

Le Bal de Sceaux

Le Bal de Sceaux (The Ball at Sceaux) is the fifth work of Honoré de Balzac, one of the oldest texts of "la Comédie Humaine".
The first edition of this novella was published in 1830 by Mame and Delaunay-Vallée in the "Scènes de la vie privée" ("Scenes of Private Life"). It was republished in 1835 by Madame Charles-Béchet, in 1839 in the Charpentier edition, and then in 1842 in the first volume of the Furne edition of "la Comédie Humaine".
Analysis.
In writing this novella Balzac seems to have been inspired by the fables of La Fontaine, especially "La fille" ("The Girl") and "Héron" ("The Heron"). There is also an allusion to La Fontaine in the choice of Émilie’s surname. The plot is similar to that of another of Balzac's works, "La Vieille Fille" ("The Old Maid"), the subject of which hesitates between several suitors and finishes by making do with the only one left.
A similar plot informs Aleksandr Pushkin's verse novel "Eugene Onegin", which was published in serial form between 1825 and 1832.
Plot.
After having haughtily refused a number of suitors, under the pretext that they are not peers of France, Émilie de Fontaine falls in love with a mysterious young man who quietly appeared at the village dance at Sceaux. Despite his refined appearance and aristocratic bearing, the unknown (Maximilien Longueville) never tells his identity and seems interested in nobody but his sister, a sickly young girl. But he is not insensible to the attention Émilie gives him and he accepts the invitation of Émilie’s father, the Comte de Fontaine. Émilie and Maximilien soon fall in love. The Comte de Fontaine, concerned for his daughter, decides to investigate this mysterious young man, and he discovers him on the Rue du Sentier, a simple cloth merchant, which horrifies Émilie. Piqued, she marries a 70 year old uncle for his title of Vice Admiral, the Comte de Kergarouët.
Several years after her marriage, Émilie discovers that Maximilien is not a clothier at all, but in fact a Vicomte de Longueville who has become a Peer of France. The young man finally explains why he secretly tended a store: he did it in order to support his family, sacrificing himself for his sick sister and for his brother, who had departed the country.

Patrick Dangerfield

Patrick Dangerfield (born 5 April 1990) is an Australian rules football player for the Adelaide Football Club. Dangerfield was Adelaide’s first selection in the 2007 National Draft after the club drafted him at pick 10 overall (somewhat controversially over Port Adelaide footballer Brad Ebert). This was despite the fact that he was still studying in his home state, Victoria, and could not train with the club consistently, whereas Ebert was performing for West Coast.
He fought for and won the right to play for the Geelong Falcons in 2007, which he did while he finished his study at school.
He played two games for the Crows late in the 2008 season and showing promising signs. In these games he wore guernsey 19, before it was retired the following year in order to assist the launch of the clubs so far successful "19th Man" campaign.
In 2009 he has become a regular in the Crows' midfield and forward line. He wears guernsey number 32 Mark Ricciuto's old number, his style of play has been likened by fans and commentators to that of the former Crows captain. He received the NAB Rising Star nomination for round 3 in season 2009 for the performance he made against Fremantle over at Subiaco Oval. Dangerfield has also won the grand final day sprint in both 2011 and 2012, being one of 4 players to win the sprint two years running.
Dangerfield graduated of the AIS-AFL Academy and toured South Africa in early 2007. In October 2007, he won the 100m and 400m titles at the Victorian Secondary Schools Athletics. Whilst at school he was also a school captain at Oberon High School. In 2012, he re-signed with AFC for three years. Reaction to this was positive, especially in South Australia, with Mark Ricciuto stating that Dangerfield "could be the greatest crow ever."

SVG filter effects

SVG filter effects are effects applied to Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. SVG is an open-standard XML format for two-dimensional vector graphics as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). A filter effect consists of a series of graphics operations that are applied to a given source vector graphic to produce a modified bitmapped result.
Filter effects are defined by filter elements. To apply a filter effect to a graphics element or a container element the 'filter' property is set on a given element. Each 'filter' element contains a set of filter primitives as its children. Each filter primitive performs a single fundamental graphical operation (e.g., a Gaussian blur or a lighting effect) on one or more inputs, producing a graphical result. Because most of the filter primitives represent some form of image processing, in most cases the output from a filter primitive is a single RGBA bitmap image (however, it will be regenerated if a higher resolution is called on).
The original source graphic or the result from a filter primitive can be used as input into one or more other filter primitives. A common application is to use the source graphic multiple times. For example, a simple filter could replace one graphic for two by adding a black copy of the original source graphic but offset to create a drop shadow. In effect, there are now two layers of graphics, both with the same original source graphics.
SVG filter primitives.
The following table lists the filter primitives available in both SVG 1.0 and SVG 1.1. SVG Tiny does not support filter effects, while SVG Basic supports only those filter primitives shown:
The current draft of the Filter Effects module of SVG 2 adds two further filter primitives: codice_1 (for custom filter effects) and codice_2 (for drop shadow). The latter is just a shorthand for a combination of other filter primitives.

Richard Louv

Richard Louv (born 1949) is an American nonfiction author and journalist. He is best known for his seventh book, "Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children From Nature-Deficit Disorder" (first published in 2005 by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill), which investigates the relationship of children and the natural world in current and historical contexts. Louv created the term “nature-deficit disorder” to describe possible negative consequences to individual health and the social fabric as children move indoors and away from physical contact with the natural world – particularly unstructured, solitary experience. Louv cites research pointing to attention disorders, obesity, a dampening of creativity and depression as problems associated with a nature-deficient childhood. He amassed information on the subject from practitioners of many disciplines to make his case, and is commonly credited with helping to inspire an international movement to reintroduce children to nature.
Career.
Louv was a columnist for "The San Diego Union-Tribune" newspaper between 1984 and 2007, its last manifestation titled The Future’s Edge. His essay, on the division of nature and humanity, is renown for its idealism. He has been a columnist and member of the editorial advisory board for "Parents" magazine and a Ford Foundation Leadership for a Changing World award program adviser. He also was an adviser for the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child [http://www.developingchild.net/. He currently is honorary co-chair of The National Forum on Children and Nature which is co-chaired by four state governors, a Visiting Scholar at Clemson University, and chairman and co-founder of the Children & Nature Network, [http://www.childrenandnature.org/ a non-profit organization.
In 2008, the National Audubon Society awarded Louv its highest honor, the Audubon Medal. He was the 2007 recipient of Clemson University's Cox Award for "sustained achievement in public service," and received the Paul K. Petzoldt Award from the Wilderness Education Association.
The U.S. Department of the Interior, and associations such as the Sierra Club, The Trust for Public Land, and The Nature Conservancy have cited Louv's book.

List of Ottoman postal rates in Palestine

The List of Ottoman postal rates in Palestine surveys the postal rates in effect between 1840–1918 during the Ottoman rule in Palestine. Rates not applicable in Palestine are not included.
The Imperial edict of 12 Ramasan 1256 (14 October 1840) and later ordinances made the distinction between three types of mail items: ordinary letters, registered letters (markings "te'ahudd olunmoshdur"), and official letters (markings "tahirat-i mühümme"). Fees were calculated by the type of mail, the weight, and the distance (measured in hours): in 1840, an ordinary letter, weighing less than 10g, had a cost per hour of 1 para. Special fees applied to samples, insured mail, special delivery, and printed matters, etc. The postal rates changed frequently, and new services were added over the years. Upon joining the Universal Postal Union on 1 July 1875, Ottoman overseas rates conformed to UPU rules.

LA-2A Leveling Amplifier

The LA-2A Leveling Amplifier is an audio compressor invented by James F. Lawrence II, founder of the Teletronix Engineering Company in Pasadena, California in the early 1960s. Teletronix was sold to Babcock Electronics of Costa Mesa, California in 1965. In 1967 Studio Electronics (eventually renamed UREI), picked up Babcock's broadcast division, including the Teletronix brand. Three versions of the LA-2A were made until 1969. The LA-2A was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame in 2004.
The LA-2A is a hand-wired, tube-based, compressor. It uses an electro-luminescent panel together with a cadmium-sulfide light dependent resistor to provide gain reduction, which, in the LA-2A, is called the T4 cell. The properties of the T4 give the LA-2A its unique character by making it an entirely program dependent design. The attack time is 10 milliseconds and the release time is about 60 ms for 50% release and 0.5 to 5 seconds for full release, depending on the previous program material.
The LA-2A has simple controls: a Peak-Reduction knob controls the gain of the side-chain circuit, and therefore, the gain reduction; a Gain Control for make-up gain; and a Limit/Compress switch which alter the compression ratio. The VU meter may also be switched to show gain reduction or output level.
The LA-2A has a sonic character that makes it sought after by many recording engineers.

Spatial justice

Spatial justice links together social justice and space. The organization of space is a crucial dimension of human societies and reflects social facts and influences social relations (Henri Lefebvre, 1968, 1972). Consequently, both justice and injustice become visible in space. Therefore, the analysis of the interactions between space and society is necessary to understand social injustices and to formulate territorial policies aiming at tackling them. It is at this junction that the concept of spatial justice has been developed.
Spatial justice: a spatial turn in the claim for social justice?
Space being a fundamental dimension of human societies, social justice is embedded in it. So the understanding of interactions between space and societies is essential to the understanding of social injustices and to a reflection on planning policies that aims at reducing them. This reflection can be guided by the concept of spatial justice, which ties Social Justice with space.
Spatial justice is a crucial challenge because it is the ultimate goal of many planning policies. However, the diversity of definitions of “Justice” (and of the possible “social contracts” that legitimate them), is high and the political objectives of regional planning or urban planning can be quite different and even contradictory.
Therefore, it is important to analyze the concept of spatial justice, which is still rarely questioned (particularly since the work of Anglo-American radical geographers in the 1970s–1980s to the extent that it has been taken for granted. These past few years, several events and publications have demonstrated the rising interest of human and social sciences for the concept of spatial justice.
Spatial Justice between issues of redistribution and decision-making processes.
The concept of Spatial Justice opens up several perspectives for social sciences. Building on the work of several famous Justice philosophers (John Rawls, 1971; Iris Marion Young, 1990, 2000), two contrasting approaches of justice have polarized the debate: one focuses on redistribution issues, the other concentrates on decision-making processes. 
A first set of approaches consists in asking questions about spatial or socio-spatial distributions and working to achieve an equal geographical distribution of society's wants and needs, such as job opportunities, access to health care, good air quality, et cetera. This is of particular concern in regions where the population has difficulty moving to a more spatially just location due to poverty, discrimination, or political restrictions (such as apartheid pass laws). Even in free, developed nations, access to many places are limited. Geographer Don Mitchell points to the mass privatization of once-public land as a common example of spatial injustice. In this distributive justice perspective, the access to material and immaterial goods, or to social positions indicates whether the situation is fair or not.
Another way of tackling the concept of spatial justice is to focus on decision-making procedures: this approach also raises issues of representations of space, of territorial or other identities and of social practices. For instance, focusing on minorities allows to explore their spatial practices but also to investigate how these are experienced and managed by various agents: this may lead to reveal forms of oppression or discrimination that a universalist approach might disregard otherwise.
In sum, depending on the chosen approach, either questions are asked about spatial distributions because justice is evaluated from “results”, or questions are asked about space representations, (spatial or not) identities and experiences because justice is defined as a process. Spatial justice stands as a unifying concept for the social sciences: its coherence stems from a reflection on the modalities of the political decision-making and on the policies implemented in order to improve spatial distributions.
Environmental justice.
The emergence of the concept of sustainable development has also fostered a debate on environmental equity. It questions our ontological relationship to the world, and the possibility of a fair policy addressing the needs of mankind, present and future, local and global, and of new forms of governance. The notion of “Environmental Justice” was created in the 1970s–1980s in North American cities to denounce the spatial overlapping between forms of racial discrimination and social-economic exclusion, industrial pollutions and vulnerability to natural hazards.

Poland–Turkey relations

Polish–Turkish relations are foreign relations between Poland and Turkey. Poland has an embassy in Ankara, and a general consulate in Istanbul. Turkey has an embassy in Warsaw. Both countries are full members of NATO and the Union for the Mediterranean. 
Polish-Turkish relations were historically strong, the official relations were established in the 15th century. The Ottoman Empire was the only major country in the world which did not recognize the Partitions of Poland. In the 19th century many Polish veterans of the November Uprising, January Uprising and Crimean War arrived in Turkey. Many Polish officers, like Michał Czajkowski, served in the Ottoman Army. Polish general Marian Langiewicz spent the last years of his life in Turkey, fought in the Ottoman Army and died in Istanbul, where he is buried at the Haydarpaşa Cemetery. Polish national poet Adam Mickiewicz spent the last months of his life in Istanbul and died there. The house where he lived was later transformed into the Adam Mickiewicz Museum.
There is also a Polish village of Polonezköy (Adampol) in Turkey. It lies on the Anatolian side of Istanbul and was settled in 1842 by Polish veterans of the November Uprising. In the 19th and 20th centuries further Polish settlers arrived. As of 2009 there is still Polish minority in the village.

In general, the Japanese cedar lives for about 500 years, but yakusugi trees live much longer. They grow on less nutritious granite soil slowly and have a very tight grain. The wood contains a lot of resin due to Yakushima's high rainfall and high humidity, making it resistant to rotting. As a result, these trees tend to have longer lives, and many larger trees have survived for more than 2,000 years. Famous examples include the Jōmon-sugi, Kigen-sugi and Wilson stump.
Logging.
A stone monument from Kagoshima-jingū shrine says that Japanese cedar and hinoki wood was carried from Yakushima to rebuild the shrine around 1560. This is the earliest known record of yakusugi being used for logging.
In addition, after conquering Kyushu, Ishida Mitsunari, a samurai who later led the Western army in the Battle of Sekigahara, had Shimazu Yoshihisa, a territorial lord of Satsuma province, examine the amount of wood in Yakushima and around 1590. 11 vessels of Shōdoshima, an island located in the Inland Sea, carried yakusugi timbers to Osaka to build Daibutsuden, in Hōkō-ji, the temple in Kyoto built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
During the Edo period (1603–1868), Tomari Jochiku, a Confucian monk of the Nichiren sect who had been born in Yakushima and served the Satsuma domain, saw the destitution of the islanders in Yakushima and submitted a plan to cut down yakusugi to the Shimazu clan daimyo. Full-scale logging began around 1640.
Yakusugi were used as shipbuilding materials or architectural materials, but most became roof tiles called hiragi (lit. flat wood). The islanders sent hiragi to Satsuma domain as an annual tribute. In addition, other yakusugi not used as an annual tribute were bought by the Satsuma clan in exchange for rice and other supplies.
In Meiji era (1868–1912), residents were restricted from cutting trees. Islanders objected to this and sued for return of the national forests, but lost. However, because this contributed to the subsequent poverty of Yakushima, Kagoshima woodcraft department announced "the plan of forest management in Yakushima" in 1921. Some of the main points include:
With this judgement yakusugi was nationalized and the timber industry was restored. As of 2001, all of the nationalized wood had been cut down except for the ones deemed national treasures, and so the logging in Yakusugi finished.
"Domaiboku".
Since it is no longer permitted to cut Yakusugi today, souvenirs etc. are made from stumps of previously felled trees and trees that fell fallen naturally in typhoons. These trees are called "domaiboku", which literally means buried trees in the ground.

Koszyce is a village in Proszowice County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Koszyce. It lies approximately east of Proszowice and east of the regional capital Kraków. The village has a population of 830.
The history of Koszyce dates back to the year 1328, when the village was for the first time mentioned in documents. On June 26, 1374, Elizabeth of Poland granted Magdeburg rights to Koszyce. There are undocumented speculations that Koszyce had received town charter before that date, and Queen Elizabeth only confirmed this fact. The town became a royal property, and was granted the right to organize weekly fairs on Mondays. On April 4, 1421, Koszyce’s privileges were confirmed by King Wladyslaw Jagiello, probably due to the fact that the 1374 document had been lost. The town prospered in the 15th century, due to a location along an important merchant trail from Krakow to Sandomierz. Furthermore, at the nearby village of Morsko was a busy Vistula river port. 
At that time, Koszyce had its coat of arms, a rectangular market square and a town hall. It also had a suburb called Jawiczowice. First mention of Koszyce’s parish church comes from mid-15th century. The town was governed by a wojt, together with a council. In the mid-17th century, there were app. 70 artisans at Koszyce. The town had a Holy Cross hospital and a parish school, and among its most famous residents was a physician named Jakub Grzywna, who moved to Koszyce from Krakow in 1520, and died here in 1531. 
The decline of Koszyce was marked by the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland, when it was ransacked and burned by the Swedish and Transilvanian invaders. After the Partitions of Poland, Koszyce was first annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 - 1915, it belonged to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During the January Uprising, Koszyce was one of the most important centers of the rebellion, and as a reprisal, the town was stripped of its charter on June 1, 1869.

Fermat's Last Theorem

In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers "a", "b", and "c" can satisfy the equation "a""n" + "b""n" = "c""n" for any integer value of "n" greater than two.
This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, famously in the margin of a copy of "Arithmetica" where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. No successful proof was published until 1995 despite the efforts of countless mathematicians during the 358 intervening years. The unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century. It is among the most famous theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its 1995 proof by Andrew Wiles it was in the "Guinness Book of World Records" for "most difficult mathematical problems".
Overview.
The problem.
Fermat's Last Theorem (known by this title historically although technically a conjecture, or unproven speculation, until proven in 1995) stood as an unsolved riddle in mathematics for over three centuries. The theorem itself is a deceptively simple statement that Fermat famously stated he had proved around 1637. His claim was discovered some 30 years later, after his death, written in the margin of a book, but with no proof provided.
The claim eventually became one of the most famous unsolved problems of mathematics. Attempts to prove it prompted substantial development in number theory, and over time Fermat's Last Theorem itself gained legendary prominence as an unsolved problem in popular mathematics. It is based on the Pythagorean theorem, which states that , where "a" and "b" are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and "c" is the length of the hypotenuse.
The Pythagorean equation has an infinite number of positive integer solutions for "a", "b", and "c"; these solutions are known as Pythagorean triples. Fermat stated that the more general equation had no solutions in positive integers if "n" is an integer greater than 2. Although he claimed to have a general proof of his conjecture, Fermat left no details of his proof apart from the special case "n" = 4.
Subsequent developments and solution.
With the special case "n" = 4 proven, the problem was to prove the theorem for exponents "n" that are prime numbers (this limitation is considered trivial to prove). Over the next two centuries (1637–1839), the conjecture was proven for only the primes 3, 5, and 7, although Sophie Germain innovated and proved an approach which was relevant to an entire class of primes. In the mid-19th century, Ernst Kummer extended this and proved the theorem for all regular primes, leaving irregular primes to be analyzed individually. Building on Kummer's work and using sophisticated computer studies, other mathematicians were able to extend the proof to cover all prime exponents up to four million, but a proof for all exponents was inaccessible (meaning that mathematicians generally considered a proof to be either impossible, or at best exceedingly difficult, or not achievable with current knowledge).
The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in full, for all "n", was finally accomplished, however, after 358 years, by Andrew Wiles in 1995, an achievement for which he was honoured and received numerous awards. The solution came in a roundabout manner, from a completely different area of mathematics.
Around 1955 Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama suspected a link might exist between elliptic curves and modular forms, two completely different areas of mathematics. Known at the time as the Taniyama–Shimura-Weil conjecture, and (eventually) as the modularity theorem, it stood on its own, with no apparent connection to Fermat's Last Theorem. It was widely seen as significant and important in its own right, but was (like Fermat's equation) widely considered to be completely inaccessible to proof.
In 1984, Gerhard Frey noticed an apparent link between the modularity theorem and Fermat's Last Theorem. This potential link was confirmed two years later by Ken Ribet (see: "Ribet's Theorem" and "Frey curve"). On hearing this, English mathematician Andrew Wiles, who had a childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, decided to try to prove the modularity theorem as a way to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. In 1993, after six years working secretly on the problem, Wiles succeeded in proving enough of the modularity theorem to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Wiles paper was massive in size and scope. A flaw was discovered in one part of his original paper during peer review and required a further year and collaboration with a past student, Richard Taylor, to resolve. As a result, the final proof in 1995 was accompanied by a second, smaller, joint paper to that effect. Wiles's achievement was reported widely in the popular press, and was popularized in books and television programs. The remaining parts of the modularity theorem were subsequently proven by other mathematicians, building on Wiles' work, between 1996 and 2001.
Mathematical history.
Pythagoras and Diophantus.
Pythagorean triples.
A Pythagorean triple – named for the ancient Greek Pythagoras – is a set of three integers ("a", "b", "c") that satisfy a special case of Fermat's equation ("n" = 2)
Examples of Pythagorean triples include (3, 4, 5) and (5, 12, 13). There are infinitely many such triples, and methods for generating such triples have been studied in many cultures, beginning with the Babylonians and later ancient Greek, Chinese, and Indian mathematicians. The traditional interest in Pythagorean triples connects with the Pythagorean theorem; in its converse form, it states that a triangle with sides of lengths "a", "b", and "c" has a right angle between the "a" and "b" legs when the numbers are a Pythagorean triple. Right angles have various practical applications, such as surveying, carpentry, masonry, and construction. Fermat's Last Theorem is an extension of this problem to higher powers, stating that no solution exists when the exponent 2 is replaced by any larger integer.
Diophantine equations.
Fermat's equation, "x""n" + "y""n" = "z""n" with positive integer solutions, is an example of a Diophantine equation, named for the 3rd-century Alexandrian mathematician, Diophantus, who studied them and developed methods for the solution of some kinds of Diophantine equations. A typical Diophantine problem is to find two integers "x" and "y" such that their sum, and the sum of their squares, equal two given numbers "A" and "B", respectively:
Diophantus's major work is the "Arithmetica", of which only a portion has survived. Fermat's conjecture of his Last Theorem was inspired while reading a new edition of the "Arithmetica", which was translated into Latin and published in 1621 by Claude Bachet.
Diophantine equations have been studied for thousands of years. For example, the solutions to the quadratic Diophantine equation "x"2 + "y"2 = "z"2 are given by the Pythagorean triples, originally solved by the Babylonians (c. 1800 BC). Solutions to linear Diophantine equations, such as 26"x" + 65"y" = 13, may be found using the Euclidean algorithm (c. 5th century BC).
Many Diophantine equations have a form similar to the equation of Fermat's Last Theorem from the point of view of algebra, in that they have no "cross terms" mixing two letters, without sharing its particular properties. For example, it is known that there are infinitely many positive integers "x", "y", and "z" such that "x""n" + "y""n" = "z""m" where "n" and "m" are relatively prime natural numbers.
Fermat's conjecture.
Problem II.8 of the "Arithmetica" asks how a given square number is split into two other squares; in other words, for a given rational number "k", find rational numbers "u" and "v" such that "k"2 = "u"2 + "v"2. Diophantus shows how to solve this sum-of-squares problem for "k" = 4 (the solutions being "u" = 16/5 and "v" = 12/5).
Around 1637, Fermat wrote his Last Theorem in the margin of his copy of the "Arithmetica" next to Diophantus’ sum-of-squares problem:
After Fermat’s death in 1665, his son Clément-Samuel Fermat produced a new edition of the book (1670) augmented with his father’s comments. The margin note became known as "Fermat’s Last Theorem", as it was the last of Fermat’s asserted theorems to remain unproven.
Did Fermat possess a general proof?
It is not known whether Fermat had actually found a valid proof for all exponents "n"; most mathematicians and historians of mathematics doubt it.. Only one related proof by him has survived, namely for the case "n" = 4, as described in the section "Proofs for specific exponents".
Fermat posed the cases of "n" = 4 and of "n" = 3 as challenges to his mathematical correspondents, such as Marin Mersenne, Blaise Pascal, and John Wallis. However, in the last thirty years of his life, Fermat never again wrote of his “truly marvellous proof” of the general case, and never published it.
The techniques Fermat might have used in such a “marvellous proof” are unknown.
Taylor and Wiles’s proof relies on 20th century techniques, which were unknown even a century ago. Fermat’s proof would have had to be elementary by comparison, given the mathematical knowledge of his time, and so could not have been the same.
While Harvey Friedman’s grand conjecture implies that any provable theorem (including Fermat’s last theorem) can be proved using only ‘elementary function arithmetic’, such a proof need only be ‘elementary’ in a technical sense but could involve millions of steps, and thus be far too long to have been Fermat’s proof.
Proofs for specific exponents.
Only one relevant proof by Fermat has survived, in which he uses the technique of infinite descent to show that the area of a right triangle with integer sides can never equal the square of an integer. His proof is equivalent to demonstrating that the equation
has no primitive solutions in integers (no pairwise coprime solutions). In turn, this proves Fermat's Last Theorem for the case "n" = 4, since the equation "a"4 + "b"4 = "c"4 can be written as "c"4 − "b"4 = ("a"2)2.
Alternative proofs of the case "n" = 4 were developed later by Frénicle de Bessy (1676), Leonhard Euler (1738), Kausler (1802), Peter Barlow (1811), Adrien-Marie Legendre (1830), Schopis (1825), Terquem (1846), Joseph Bertrand (1851), Victor Lebesgue (1853, 1859, 1862),</ref> Theophile Pepin (1883), Tafelmacher (1893), David Hilbert (1897), Bendz (1901), Gambioli (1901), Leopold Kronecker (1901), Bang (1905), Sommer (1907), Bottari (1908), Karel Rychlík (1910), Nutzhorn (1912), Robert Carmichael (1913), Hancock (1931), and Vrǎnceanu (1966).
For another proof for "n"=4 by infinite descent, see Infinite descent: Non-solvability of "r"2 + "s"4 = "t"4. For various proofs for "n"=4 by infinite descent, see Grant and Perella (1999), Barbara (2007), and Dolan (2011).
After Fermat proved the special case "n" = 4, the general proof for all "n" required only that the theorem be established for all odd prime exponents. In other words, it was necessary to prove only that the equation "a""n" + "b""n" = "c""n" has no integer solutions ("a", "b", "c") when "n" is an odd prime number. This follows because a solution ("a", "b", "c") for a given "n" is equivalent to a solution for all the factors of "n". For illustration, let "n" be factored into "d" and "e", "n" = "de". The general equation
implies that ("a""d", "b""d", "c""d") is a solution for the exponent "e"
Thus, to prove that Fermat's equation has no solutions for "n" > 2, it suffices to prove that it has no solutions for at least one prime factor of every "n". All integers "n" > 2 contain a factor of 4, or an odd prime number, or both. Therefore, Fermat's Last Theorem can be proven for all "n" if it can be proven for "n" = 4 and for all odd primes "p" (the only "even" prime number is the number 2).
In the two centuries following its conjecture (1637–1839), Fermat's Last Theorem was proven for three odd prime exponents "p" = 3, 5 and 7. The case "p" = 3 was first stated by Abu-Mahmud Khojandi (10th century), but his attempted proof of the theorem was incorrect.</ref> In 1770, Leonhard Euler gave a proof of "p" = 3, but his proof by infinite descent contained a major gap. However, since Euler himself had proven the lemma necessary to complete the proof in other work, he is generally credited with the first proof.</ref> Independent proofs were published by Kausler (1802), Legendre (1823, 1830), Calzolari (1855), Gabriel Lamé (1865), Peter Guthrie Tait (1872), Günther (1878), Gambioli (1901), Krey (1909), Rychlík (1910), Stockhaus (1910), Carmichael (1915), Johannes van der Corput (1915), Axel Thue (1917), and Duarte (1944). The case "p" = 5 was proven independently by Legendre and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet around 1825. Alternative proofs were developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1875, posthumous), Lebesgue (1843), Lamé (1847), Gambioli (1901), Werebrusow (1905), Rychlík (1910), van der Corput (1915), and Guy Terjanian (1987). The case "p" = 7 was proven by Lamé in 1839.</ref> His rather complicated proof was simplified in 1840 by Lebesgue, and still simpler proofs were published by Angelo Genocchi in 1864, 1874 and 1876.</ref> Alternative proofs were developed by Théophile Pépin (1876) and Edmond Maillet (1897).
Fermat's Last Theorem has also been proven for the exponents "n" = 6, 10, and 14. Proofs for "n" = 6 have been published by Kausler, Thue, Tafelmacher, Lind, Kapferer, Swift, and Breusch. Similarly, Dirichlet and Terjanian each proved the case "n" = 14, while Kapferer and Breusch each proved the case "n" = 10. Strictly speaking, these proofs are unnecessary, since these cases follow from the proofs for "n" = 3, 5, and 7, respectively. Nevertheless, the reasoning of these even-exponent proofs differs from their odd-exponent counterparts. Dirichlet's proof for "n" = 14 was published in 1832, before Lamé's 1839 proof for "n" = 7.
Many proofs for specific exponents use Fermat's technique of infinite descent, which Fermat used to prove the case "n" = 4, but many do not. However, the details and auxiliary arguments are often "ad hoc" and tied to the individual exponent under consideration. Since they became ever more complicated as "p" increased, it seemed unlikely that the general case of Fermat's Last Theorem could be proven by building upon the proofs for individual exponents. Although some general results on Fermat's Last Theorem were published in the early 19th century by Niels Henrik Abel and Peter Barlow, the first significant work on the general theorem was done by Sophie Germain.
Sophie Germain.
In the early 19th century, Sophie Germain developed several novel approaches to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for all exponents. First, she defined a set of auxiliary primes θ constructed from the prime exponent "p" by the equation θ = 2"hp"+1, where "h" is any integer not divisible by three. She showed that if no integers raised to the "p"th power were adjacent modulo θ (the "non-consecutivity condition"), then θ must divide the product "xyz". Her goal was to use mathematical induction to prove that, for any given "p", infinitely many auxiliary primes θ satisfied the non-consecutivity condition and thus divided "xyz"; since the product "xyz" can have at most a finite number of prime factors, such a proof would have established Fermat's Last Theorem. Although she developed many techniques for establishing the non-consecutivity condition, she did not succeed in her strategic goal. She also worked to set lower limits on the size of solutions to Fermat's equation for a given exponent "p", a modified version of which was published by Adrien-Marie Legendre. As a byproduct of this latter work, she proved Sophie Germain's theorem, which verified the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem (namely, the case in which "p" does not divide "xyz") for every odd prime exponent less than 100. Germain tried unsuccessfully to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all even exponents, specifically for "n" = 2"p", which was proven by Guy Terjanian in 1977. In 1985, Leonard Adleman, Roger Heath-Brown and Étienne Fouvry proved that the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem holds for infinitely many odd primes "p".
Ernst Kummer and the theory of ideals.
In 1847, Gabriel Lamé outlined a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem based on factoring the equation "x""p" + "y""p" = "z""p" in complex numbers, specifically the cyclotomic field based on the roots of the number 1. His proof failed, however, because it assumed incorrectly that such complex numbers can be factored uniquely into primes, similar to integers. This gap was pointed out immediately by Joseph Liouville, who later read a paper that demonstrated this failure of unique factorisation, written by Ernst Kummer.
Kummer set himself the task of determining whether the cyclotomic field could be generalized to include new prime numbers such that unique factorisation was restored. He succeeded in that task by developing the ideal numbers. Using the general approach outlined by Lamé, Kummer proved both cases of Fermat's Last Theorem for all regular prime numbers. However, he could not prove the theorem for the exceptional primes (irregular primes) which conjecturally occur approximately 39% of the time; the only irregular primes below 100 are 37, 59 and 67.
Mordell conjecture.
In the 1920s, Louis Mordell posed a conjecture that implied that Fermat's equation has at most a finite number of nontrivial primitive integer solutions if the exponent "n" is greater than two. This conjecture was proven in 1983 by Gerd Faltings, and is now known as Faltings' theorem.
Computational studies.
In the latter half of the 20th century, computational methods were used to extend Kummer's approach to the irregular primes. In 1954, Harry Vandiver used a SWAC computer to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for all primes up to 2521. By 1978, Samuel Wagstaff had extended this to all primes less than 125,000. By 1993, Fermat's Last Theorem had been proven for all primes less than four million.
However despite these efforts and their results, no proof existed of Fermat's Last Theorem. Proofs of individual exponents by their nature could never prove the "general" case: even if all exponents were verified up to an extremely large number X, a higher exponent beyond X might still exist for which the claim was not true. (This had been the case with some other past conjectures, and it could not be ruled out in this conjecture.)
Connection with elliptic curves.
The strategy that ultimately led to a successful proof of Fermat's Last Theorem arose from the "astounding" Taniyama–Shimura-Weil conjecture, proposed around 1955, which many mathematicians believed would be near to impossible to prove, and which was linked in the 1980s by Gerhard Frey, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ken Ribet to Fermat's equation. By accomplishing a partial proof of this conjecture in 1995, Andrew Wiles ultimately succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem, as well as leading the way to a full proof by others of what is now the modularity theorem.
The Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture.
Around 1955, Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama observed a possible link between two apparently completely distinct branches of mathematics, elliptic curves and modular forms. The resulting modularity theorem (at the time known as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture) states that every elliptic curve is modular, meaning that it can be associated with a unique modular form.
It was initially dismissed as unlikely or highly speculative, and was taken more seriously when number theorist André Weil found evidence supporting it, but no proof; as a result the "astounding" conjecture was often known as the Taniyama–Shimura-Weil conjecture. It became a part of the Langlands programme, a list of important conjectures needing proof or disproof.
Even after gaining serious attention, the conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as extraordinarily difficult or perhaps inaccessible to proof. For example, Wiles' ex-supervisor John Coates states that it seemed "impossible to actually prove", and Ken Ribet considered himself "one of the vast majority of people who believed was completely inaccessible", adding that "Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it."
Frey's equation / Ribet's theorem.
In 1984, Gerhard Frey noted a link between Fermat's equation and the modularity theorem, then still a conjecture. If Fermat's equation had any solution ("a", "b", "c") for exponent "p" > 2, then it could be shown that the elliptic curve (now known as a Frey curve )
would have such unusual properties that it was unlikely to be modular. This would conflict with the modularity theorem, which asserted that all elliptic curves are modular. As such, Frey observed that a proof of the Taniyama–Shimura-Weil conjecture would simultaneously prove Fermat's Last Theorem and equally, a "disproof" or refutation of Fermat's Last Theorem would disprove the conjecture.
Following this strategy, a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem required two steps. First, it was necessary to show that Frey's intuition was correct: that if an elliptic curve were constructed in this way, using a set of numbers that were a solution of Fermat's equation, the resulting elliptic curve could not be modular. Frey did not quite succeed in proving this rigorously; the missing piece (the so-called "epsilon conjecture", now known as Ribet's theorem) was identified by Jean-Pierre Serre and proven in 1986 by Ken Ribet. Second, it was necessary to prove the modularity theorem – or at least to prove it for the sub-class of cases (known as semistable elliptic curves) which included Frey's equation – and this was widely believed inaccessible to proof by contemporary mathematicians.
Wiles's general proof.
Ribet's proof of the epsilon conjecture in 1986 accomplished the first of the two goals proposed by Frey. Upon hearing of Ribet's success, Andrew Wiles, an English mathematician with a childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, and a prior study area of elliptical equations, decided to commit himself to accomplishing the second half: proving a special case of the modularity theorem (then known as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture) for semistable elliptic curves.
Wiles worked on that task for six years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife. His initial study suggested proof by induction, and he based his initial work and first significant breakthrough on Galois theory before switching to an attempt to extend Horizontal Iwasawa theory for the inductive argument around 1990–91 when it seemed that there was no existing approach adequate to the problem. However, by the summer of 1991, Iwasawa theory also seemed to not be reaching the central issues in the problem. In response, he approached colleagues to seek out any hints of cutting edge research and new techniques, and discovered an Euler system recently developed by Victor Kolyvagin and Matthias Flach which seemed "tailor made" for the inductive part of his proof. Wiles studied and extended this approach, which worked. Since his work relied extensively on this approach, which was new to mathematics and to Wiles, in January 1993 he asked his Princeton colleague, Nick Katz, to check his reasoning for subtle errors. Their conclusion at the time was that the techniques used by Wiles seemed to be working correctly.
By mid-May 1993 Wiles felt able to tell his wife he thought he had solved the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, and by June he felt sufficiently confident to present his results in three lectures delivered on 21–23 June 1993 at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences. Specifically, Wiles presented his proof of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture for semistable elliptic curves; together with Ribet's proof of the epsilon conjecture, this implied Fermat's Last Theorem. However, it became apparent during peer review that a critical point in the proof was incorrect. It contained an error in a bound on the order of a particular group. The error was caught by several mathematicians refereeing Wiles's manuscript including Katz (in his role as reviewer), who alerted Wiles on 23 August 1993.
The error would not have rendered his work worthless – each part of Wiles' work was highly significant and innovative by itself, as were the many developments and techniques he had created in the course of his work, and only one part was affected. However without this part proven, there was no actual proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Wiles spent almost a year trying to repair his proof, initially by himself and then in collaboration with Richard Taylor, without success.
On 19 September 1994, on the verge of giving up, Wiles had a flash of insight that the proof could be saved by returning to his original Horizontal Iwasawa theory approach, which he had abandoned in favour of the Kolyvagin–Flach approach, this time strengthening it with expertise gained in Kolyvagin–Flach's approach. On 24 October 1994, Wiles submitted two manuscripts, "Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem" and "Ring theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras", the second of which was co-authored with Taylor and proved that certain conditions were met which were needed to justify the corrected step in the main paper. The two papers were vetted and published as the entirety of the May 1995 issue of the "Annals of Mathematics". These papers established the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, the last step in proving Fermat's Last Theorem, 358 years after it was conjectured.
Subsequent developments.
The full Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was finally proved by , , and who, building on Wiles' work, incrementally chipped away at the remaining cases until the full result was proved. The now fully proved conjecture became known as the modularity theorem.
Several other theorems in number theory similar to Fermat's Last Theorem also follow from the same reasoning, using the modularity theorem. For example: no cube can be written as a sum of two coprime "n"-th powers, "n" ≥ 3. (The case "n" = 3 was already known by Euler.)
Exponents other than positive integers.
Rational exponents.
All solutions of the Diophantine equation formula_5 when "n"=1 were computed by Lenstra in 1992. In the case in which the "m"th roots are required to be real and positive, all solutions are given by
for positive integers "r, s, t" with "s" and "t" coprime.
In 2004, for "n">2, Bennett, Glass, and Szekely proved that if gcd("n","m")=1, then there are integer solutions if and only if 6 divides "m", and formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11 are different complex 6th roots of the same real number.
Negative exponents.
"n" = –1.
All primitive (pairwise coprime) integer solutions to formula_12 can be written as
for positive, coprime integers "m, n".
"n" = –2.
The case "n" = –2 also has an infinitude of solutions, and these have a geometric interpretation in terms of right triangles with integer sides and an integer altitude to the hypotenuse. All primitive solutions to formula_16 are given by
for coprime integers "u", "v" with "v" > "u". The geometric interpretation is that "a" and "b" are the integer legs of a right triangle and "d" is the integer altitude to the hypotenuse. Then the hypotenuse itself is the integer
so ("a, b, c") is a Pythagorean triple.
Integer "n" < –2.
There are no solutions in integers for formula_21 for integer "n" < –2. If there were, the equation could be multiplied through by formula_22 to obtain formula_23, which is impossible by Fermat's Last Theorem.
Values other than positive integers.
Fermat's last theorem can easily be extended to positive rationals:
can have no solutions, because any solution could be rearranged as:
to which Fermat's Last Theorem applies.
Monetary prizes.
In 1816 and again in 1850, the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize for a general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. In 1857, the Academy awarded 3000 francs and a gold medal to Kummer for his research on ideal numbers, although he had not submitted an entry for the prize. Another prize was offered in 1883 by the Academy of Brussels.
In 1908, the German industrialist and amateur mathematician Paul Wolfskehl bequeathed 100,000 marks to the Göttingen Academy of Sciences to be offered as a prize for a complete proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. On 27 June 1908, the Academy published nine rules for awarding the prize. Among other things, these rules required that the proof be published in a peer-reviewed journal; the prize would not be awarded until two years after the publication; and that no prize would be given after 13 September 2007, roughly a century after the competition was begun. Wiles collected the Wolfskehl prize money, then worth $50,000, on 27 June 1997.
Prior to Wiles' proof, thousands of incorrect proofs were submitted to the Wolfskehl committee, amounting to roughly 10 feet (3 meters) of correspondence. In the first year alone (1907–1908), 621 attempted proofs were submitted, although by the 1970s, the rate of submission had decreased to roughly 3–4 attempted proofs per month. According to F. Schlichting, a Wolfskehl reviewer, most of the proofs were based on elementary methods taught in schools, and often submitted by "people with a technical education but a failed career". In the words of mathematical historian Howard Eves, "Fermat's Last Theorem has the peculiar distinction of being the mathematical problem for which the greatest number of incorrect proofs have been published."

Colin Kay

Colin Kay CBE (30 October 1926 – 5 June 2008) was a New Zealand sportsman and politician. He was the 34th Mayor of Auckland City, elected for one term serving from 1980 to 1983, and chairman of the Auckland Regional Council from 1986 to 1992. He was also the triple jump champion of New Zealand in 1950 and 1951, and represented New Zealand at the 1950 Empire Games in Auckland.
Biography.
Kay was born in Auckland in 1926, his father owned and operated a womenswear manufacturing and retailing business, and his mother was a homemaker. The family lived in Remuera, and Kay attended King's College, Auckland from 1939 to 1943, where he was a house prefect, and won a tennis championship and an intercollegiate high jump competition. His mother supported his sports, attending all his sports meetings, and telling him to dig a pit in part of the family tennis court so he could practice his jumping. Kay later enrolled in accounting at the University of Auckland, while not completing his studies he was active in athletics and played rugby. He worked at and later purchased his father's business. Kay was Jewish. 
Kay competed in the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, coming 8th in the hop step and jump at 13.91m. He was the New Zealand triple jump champion in 1950 with a jump of 14.14m, and in 1951 with a jump of 14.31m.
The University of Auckland Athletics Club successfully nominated Kay to lead the national team to the 1962 Commonwealth Games team in Perth, where New Zealand won 32 medals including 10 golds. He achieved a goal to raise $150,000 for the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, and was on the board of directors for the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland.
Kay founded the Auckland Joggers Club with Arthur Lydiard in 1962, and the annual Auckland Round the Bays fun run in 1973. With Douglas Myers in 1977 he jointly founded the New Zealand Sports Foundation, where he served as Governor for 16 years. He was a founder and the chairman of the Peter Snell Institute of Sport in 2000, and organisation with the objective of finding and promoting sporting talent in New Zealand. 
He was first elected to the Auckland City Council in 1971, and was later elected mayor of Auckland in 1980, succeeding Dove-Myer Robinson.
He received a CBE in the 1990 New Year honours, for services to sport, politics and the community. He died in 2008, more than one year after suffering a major stroke, and was survived by his wife and three sons.
The main stand of Mt Smart Stadium was named the Colin Kay stand in his honour.

Hebdów

Hebdów is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Nowe Brzesko, within Proszowice County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It lies approximately north-east of Nowe Brzesko, south-east of Proszowice, and east of the regional capital Kraków.
Hebdów is famous across the region for its Norbertine Abbey, which was founded in the first half of the 12th century (one of the bells at the abbey bears the date 1108). The historic complex (the abbey together with a church) currently belongs to the Piarists. It is home to a sanctuary of "Our Lady of Hebdów" ("Matka Boska Hebdowska"), and the 45-meter tall towers of the church are visible from a large distance.
The history of the abbey dates back to the year 1146, when two knights of High Duke of Poland, Bolesław IV the Curly, invited here Premonstratensian monks from Strahov Monastery in the Kingdom of Bohemia. The abbey at Hebdów became a branch of the Czech monastery, with first monks having been of Czech origin, and the first abbot a German man named Wosolanus, who died in 1179. Originally, both monks and nuns lived at Hebdów. After some time however, Norbertine nuns moved to the village of Zwierzyniec, which now is a district of Kraków. In 1279, wójt Gotfryd of Ślezino founded the town of Nowe Brzesko, located only three kilometers from Hebdów. The town remained property of the monastery until the 19th century. In the Middle Ages, Hebdów Abbey emerged as a regional center of the Norbertines. It controlled other abbeys, at Witów, Nowy Sącz, Zwierzyniec, Imbramowice, Busko Zdrój, Płock and Krzyżanowice.
The decline of the abbey was brought about by the Protestant Reformation. Furthermore, the abbots at Hebdów were selected by Polish Kings, which had negative consequences, as they were more interested in profits than in spiritual discipline of their monks. In the mid-17th century, the church was expanded by abbot Ludwik Stępkowski, who later became the Bishop of Kamieniec Podolski. Several new ornaments, altars and paintings were added to the church at that time, including the so-called "Oratorio Chapel". The new, remodelled church was blessed by Bishop Mikołaj Oborski on May 31, 1678.
After the Partitions of Poland Hebdów briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, in which it remained until World War I. In 1819, Russians took control over the complex, taking away the abbey’s library, with its precious collection of ancient prints and books. In 1859 the church burned, and services were temporarily moved to Nowe Brzesko. Since 1949, the complex has been administered by the Piarists. Arguably, the most famous of the Hebdów abbots was Józef Andrzej Załuski.

Nowe Brzesko

Nowe Brzesko is a town in Proszowice County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Nowe Brzesko. It lies approximately south-east of Proszowice and east of the regional capital Kraków. Nowe Brzesko has an approximate population of 1,700. It gained town rights in 1279, but lost that status in 1870 by decree of the Russian tsar. It became a town again on 1 January 2011.
Nowe Brzesko was first mentioned in the first half of the 13th century. The village belonged to the Bishops of Kraków, who handed it to the Norbertine abbey from nearby Hebdów. On October 6, 1279, it became a town, and its first known wójt was Gotfryd, the son of Arnold from Ślesin in Greater Poland. Due to several privileges, the town quickly developed, but in the first half of the 15th century it declined, due to a catastrophic flood of the Vistula (1442). Furthermore, in 1444-45 it was ransacked by the unpaid royal soldiers, returning to Poland after the defeat in the Battle of Varna. As a result, Nowe Brzesko, while still a town, did not differ from local villages. Artisans were few, and fairs were not organized. In 1522, King Zygmunt Stary ordered local authorities to mark boundaries of Nowe Brzesko, and create a street system, together with a market place. Town’s residents were in constant conflict with abbots from Hebdów, who tried to get rid of their privileges. 
In the late 16th century, the population of Nowe Brzesko was app. 1,000. The town slowly developed, but wars of the mid-17th century (see Swedish invasion of Poland) completely destroyed it and decimated the population. Polish, Swedish, Tatar and Transilvanian soldiers stayed here, robbing and stealing. Poverty and hunger were common, and the population declined by 50%. Furthermore, conflicts with the Hebdów abbots did not end, and residents of the town were forced to work for the abbey (see Serfdom). In 1761, a group of inhabitants rebelled against the authority of the abbot, and asked King Stanisław August Poniatowski to support them. 
In the late 18th century (see Partitions of Poland), Nowe Brzesko was annexed by the Austrian Empire 
(1795). In 1815, it became part of the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1818, the abbey was dissolved, and the town, with its 151 houses and 900 residents, became state property. Located away from main roads, near the border with Austrian Galicia, the town lost its charter in 1869, becoming a village. In the Second Polish Republic, it belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. Nowe Brzesko once again became a town in 2011.

Sqrambled Scuares

Sqrambled Scuares (sic; originally known as Scrambled Squares) is a game show airing on HTC Digital Cable in South Carolina. It has been hosted by local personality Buzz Berry since its inception, and produced by Berry's production company BZB Productions. The show tapes from The Myrtle Beach Mall on Fridays at 7:00 PM.
Originally, Berry handled nearly all of the hosting duties himself. Delilah Christie became co-host on Episode #MB38 (October 7, 2013), with her duties consisting of some opening banter with Berry, introducing the players, and announcing each round's category, number of words, number of letters, and number of Missers. Christie is not present onstage during the rest of the show and was not present at all for Episodes MB48-MB49 (January 13-20, 2014), although it is not currently known whether this is a temporary departure.
Episodes can be viewed on the show's website. An official Blip page contains the current Myrtle Beach shows along with most of the former Boone and Hickory versions.
Gameplay.
Two contestants compete; each is spotted 100 points to start the game.
Players take turns picking squares from a game board of 16. If the player reveals a letter, it is placed on the descrambler board in its proper word, but in the order it was found, and the player is awarded points and a chance to unscramble the squares; consonants are worth 10 points, while vowels are worth 20.
Once both players have found a letter during a round, they may ask for revealed letters to be placed in their proper positions for a cost of 10 or 20 points (consonants and vowels, respectively). All letters placed in this way are covered with a transparent yellow card, whether by spending points or finding a "Placer" (below).
Special Squares.
As the game is played, players may find various special items that will help or hinder them as the game progresses:
Solving.
After finding a letter, or placing one, a player has five seconds to state "I'd like to unscramble the squares". The host will then give the player a chance to give the solution; if the solution given is correct, that player picks up an additional 100 points, while his or her opponent "loses" 100 points. Scores can never go below zero.
Players can also ask to unscramble the squares "before" picking or placing a letter; this is generally not done if there are no more Missers on the board, although it has happened on occasion.
If nobody has unscrambled the squares after all of the letters have been found or five minutes have elapsed (whichever comes first), the players alternate turns "placing letters only" until one of them unscrambles the squares. Players still lose points for each letter placed.
On at least one episode, the winner of each round also had the first chance at a bonus question called the "Sqrambled Scuestion". The question had four multiple-choice options, read in a random order. If the player gave the correct answer, they won a $25 Wal-Mart gift card and a 50-point bonus. If answered incorrectly, the opponent was given a chance to steal the points and gift card.
Winning.
The game is played in two rounds, each with one puzzle. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins $50 and first chance to play the "Super Sqramble"; in the event of a tie (the most recent being Episode #392 on October 26, 2009), both players win the game and $50, and play Super Sqramble together.
Super Sqramble.
The day's winner has 60 seconds to unscramble a 9 or 10-letter word, two letters of which are on a yellow background. Once 15 seconds have elapsed, the host tells the player the location of one of the yellow letters, and once 30 seconds have elapsed, the host tells the player the location of the other yellow letter. Players may move letters around as they wish during the round.
At any point during the round the player may press a button to stop the clock and indicate that they know the word. If they are correct, they win an additional $100 "Super Stash of Cash" ($500 on every 100th show). If not, the time resumes and they may continue moving letters and guess again.
Should the first contestant fail, their opponent (who watches the proceedings from a "second try" chair) is given a third letter to move into its proper position and ten seconds to unscramble the word for $50.
In the event of a main-game tie, the contestants work together in the Super Sqramble and split $200 if they win.
Currently, the local Auntie Anne's provides the prize money.
Changes.
Originally, only the day's winner could try Super Sqramble. When the "second try" rule was first implemented, the runner-up had only five seconds to unscramble the word.
Home Scramble.
During the commercial breaks, short three-second clips appear with different letters on-screen. During the show, the host gives the location of one of the letters. The letters unscramble to form a word pertaining to a particular category, and viewers who call or e-mail the show with the correct word are entered into a drawing for prizes.
Typically there are three winners each week, and each wins a gift certificate to the local Golden Corral.
Set.
The show's set is very basic, with sixteen four-sided boxes in the center of the stage; each box consists of the number, a "bonus card" side (if applicable), the hidden letter (if applicable), and a blank side. On each side of the border are six "blank" colored boxes.
The score displays use an orange seven-segment readout on a black background; the episode's sponsor (currently Auntie Anne's) has a card located between the contestants.
The puzzle board has two lines of holders for the letters, with two TV monitors showing the category; the entire board flips around for the Super Sqramble, with the monitors changing to a 60-second clock.
Changes.
The original score displays used a rotating designation for "One Hundred", "Two Hundred", etc. written in script over a two-digit number with the contestant nameplates underneath; the current score displays (and nametag placements) debuted on March 31, 2003 (Episode #26).
For at least the first 100 episodes, the show used "twenty-five" boxes at center-stage; this presumably allowed for longer puzzles, more Missers, or both. In addition, the puzzle board had no category displays.
The plaque showing the main sponsor's logo (the sponsor that provided the bonus money) was added between the contestants' scores on June 7, 2004 (Episode #84). Two weeks later (June 21), an oversized $100 bill was placed underneath the show's sponsor plaque between the contestants. This was changed to a single picture with a wad of money on October 6, 2008.
The lights to denote the current contestant's turn debuted on July 3, 2006, as did a more colorful backdrop behind the contestants. The lights bordering the contestant podium (also to denote turns and winners) first appeared on July 31, 2006 and remained through 2011.
The contestant nameplates were given a much larger font beginning on June 9, 2008 (#284), which was also used for the last seven Hickory episodes. The current style, which debuted when the show moved to Myrtle Beach, has colored squares behind each name, which themselves are composed of individual letters. 
The first sponsor shown on the contestant podium was High Country Bank from June 7, 2004 to May 2, 2005; from May 9 to June 20, the "Scrambled Squares" logo was seen instead of a sponsor, suggesting that BZB was paying the winnings out-of-pocket. On June 27, 2005, Piedmont Federal began sponsoring the "Super Stash of Cash", with United Community Bank sponsoring the "Big Bundle of Bucks" beginning on January 19, 2009 (#337) and alternating with Piedmont; occasionally, a second sponsor's plaque would be adjacent to that of the primary sponsor. United Community became the sole sponsor beginning on December 7, 2009 (#400), when the show returned to airing one new episode per week; the "Super Stash" plaque was also retired.
When the show returned to airing two new episodes per week on May 30, 2011, United Community sponsored both episodes; the following week (June 6), TCBY began sponsoring the Big Bundle of Bucks on each episode. While no official reason was given for the abrupt change, United Community's last two episodes had very fast Bonus Sqramble solves (two seconds on #438, five seconds on #439).
Production notes.
Former versions.
"Scrambled Squares" began on November 5, 1999 as a brief series airing in the Greensboro market. The Boone version (which, in addition to Charter Cable, aired on WLNN-LP) aired from 2002-2011 with a version for the Hickory market running for a brief time in 2008.
From January 14, 2008 to November 16, 2009, and from May 27, 2011 through the end of the Boone era, the show taped on Tuesdays at 6:00 and 7:00 PM. For the latter period, the second taping was "Sqrambled Scuares Squared" (two teams of two), which only lasted 11 episodes.
Beginning with the 200th Boone episode on January 22, 2007, each new episode of "Sqrambled Scuares" was available for viewing on the show's website. Although thumbnails and pages were viewable, the first 199 Boone episodes (through January 15, 2007) – plus Episode #209 – were not available for unknown reasons.
The show's Blip page contains all Boone episodes from #264 (March 22, 2008) onward and all Hickory episodes except the first.
Anniversary episodes.
The show's 100th episode aired on October 4, 2004; its 200th episode aired on January 22, 2007; and its 300th episode aired on August 11, 2008. In all three instances, the top prize was increased from $100 to $500. 
On the 400th episode (December 7, 2009), after randomly selecting contestants from the audience, each contestant was paired with a randomly assigned second person known as a "box buddy"; the box buddy did not play, but received $50 if their contestant partner won the game and an additional $100 if their partner won the Super Sqramble (which was worth the usual $100). In addition, at the end of the show, one additional number was drawn; the holder of that number won $50. The contestants automatically won $50 each just for playing; only one round was played on this episode, and unlike other episodes, "both" contestants kept their prizes.
The difference in the time between the 200th and 300th episodes (18 months) as opposed to the 100th and 200th (28 months) is due to the adoption of the twice-weekly format; this began with Episode #246 on January 14, 2008.
Special episodes.
"Sqrambled Scuares" has done many special shows, including couples playing against each other (first happening on March 8, 2004); however, a second "couples" episode would not be held until January 30, 2006.
A "Western Youth Network" edition was broadcast on February 27, 2006, and again on February 11, 2008; a similar "Father & Son Edition" was aired on March 13, 2006.
Similar "themed" shows have also been done, beginning with Episode #37 on June 16, 2003 – a "Horn In The Wests" battle between Darrell King and Jenny Cole-Reed; it was also one of the lowest-scoring episodes in the series' history, with the final scores being 270 to 180.
Several episodes have been done for charity, including a "Watauga County Crimestoppers" edition (April 2, 2007) in which two games were played with two sets of contestants, the winners playing the Super Sqramble together. Another was an "American Red Cross: Watauga County Chapter" match on March 14, 2005.

American entry into Canada by land

U.S. citizens and permanent residents entering Canada by land are required to possess the requisite documentation, and to meet other criteria before they are allowed entry into Canada. Consequently, travelers must also meet the requirements for re-entering the U.S. at the end of their visit.
Visitor entry into Canada.
Entry into Canada is solely determined by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officials in accordance with Canadian law. Visitors are required to have the necessary travel documentation and be in good health. If asked for, they must satisfy an immigration officer of ties to their country of origin. Such ties include a job, home, and family. They must satisfy the officer that they will leave Canada at the end of their visit. They must also have sufficient money for their stay.
All items belonging to an individual, including the vehicle an individual may be traveling in, are subject to search by the CBSA.
Documentation.
Canadian law requires that all persons entering Canada must carry both proof of citizenship and identity. A valid U.S. passport or passport card is preferred, although a birth certificate, naturalization certificate, citizenship certificate, or another document proving US nationality together with a government issued photo ID (such as a driver's license) is acceptable to establish identity and nationality.
Enhanced Driver's Licenses.
An enhanced driver's license or EDL (currently issued by Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington) is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative to re-enter the United States via a land or water border. Neither the Canadian Border Services Agency, nor Citizenship and Immigration Canada have an official policy as to whether an EDL issued to a US citizen establishes proof of nationality and identity in the same way that a passport does. However, as EDLs are also issued to Canadian citizens in several provinces and are routinely accepted at the border, nonetheless it appears that the CBSA does accept an EDL at the border for US visitors.
NEXUS/FAST.
NEXUS is a joint US/Canadian program for pre-approved, low risk travelers and requires an extensive background check and face to face interview with border officials of both nations. FAST is the equivalent for international truck drivers. Membership in either program can expedite border clearance through the use of dedicated lanes.
United States Permanent Residents.
United States permanent residents are required to show their Permanent Resident Card (green card). No passport or visa is required.
Minors 18 and under.
Children under 16 need only present proof of U.S. citizenship. Nevertheless, it is recommended that identification for children be carried anyway. Any person under 18 traveling alone requires a letter from a parent or guardian granting permission to travel to Canada. The letter must state the traveler's name and the duration of the trip.
A divorced parent who has or shares custody of a child should carry a copy of the custody document. An adult accompanying a child and who is not the child's parent or legal guardian should have written permission from the parents or guardians to supervise the child. When traveling in a group of vehicles, parents or guardians should be in the same vehicle as their children when arriving at the border. CBSA personnel are looking for missing children and may question adults about children traveling with them.
Documentation for vehicles.
Persons driving into Canada must have their vehicle's registration document and proof of insurance.
Visas and admissibility.
A visa is not required for U.S. citizens to visit Canada for up to 180 days. Anyone seeking to enter Canada for any purpose besides a visit (e.g. to work, study or immigrate) must qualify for the appropriate entry status and can see the Canadian immigration website. The Canadian embassy or nearest consulate can be contacted for additional information.
Inadmissibility.
Some persons are inadmissible—they are not allowed to enter Canada.
, if a person is denied entry and advised to re-enter the U.S., they are issued form IMM 5292. This form indicates that the person is allowed to withdraw their application to enter Canada, and is allowed to leave Canada. Persons who have been denied entry and provided this form are advised by the CBSA to show this form to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). There appears to be no legal precedent, however, for the traveler to voluntarily submit this form to the CBP, and doing so may cause the CBP to consider the traveler suspicious, and as a result they may subject the traveler to exhaustive questioning and search.
Grounds for inadmissibility.
Individuals may be refused entry to or removed from Canada on the following grounds:
Avoiding inadmissibility.
Persons can be denied entry into Canada on the basis of suspicion alone. In particular, the CBSA may deny entry to persons they doubt will be able to support themselves and their dependents, or whose willingness and means to return to the U.S. is in doubt. Certain documents, such as the following, can serve to reduce these doubts:
Criminal inadmissibility.
A single criminal conviction, no matter how minor or how long ago, is grounds for exclusion from Canada. With the exception of civil traffic violations such as speeding, and some municipal ordinance infractions (which are typically not handled through the legal system) such as parking violations or littering, persons with a conviction must either have received a pardon, applied for and been accepted for rehabilitation, met the requirement to be considered deemed rehabilitated, or if ineligible for rehabilitation or deemed rehabilitated status, apply for and receive a temporary resident permit (a special type of visa) to enter Canada.
Rehabilitation.
To be a candidate for rehabilitation, at least five years (or more depending on the severity of the offense) since the conclusion of any sentence imposed (imprisonment, probation, fine paid, suspension of driver's license, etc...) must have elapsed. Due to differences between legal systems, an overturned conviction or dismissed charges does not automatically overcome inadmissibility, unless the offense itself occurred in Canada. However, applicants in either of these situations can use an abbreviated process and the five year waiting period generally does not apply. In simple cases, such as a single misdemeanor conviction, the application can typically be reviewed and approved by a Canadian Embassy, High Counsel, or CIC office. For more complicated histories or in the case of a felony conviction, the application will need to be forwarded to Ottawa for approval. Processing time in either case can take several months to a year or more, so it is advisable to begin the process of applying for rehabilitation well in advance of any planned travel to Canada. Factors considered when determining whether to approve an application for rehabilitation or not include the nature of the offense, the time elapsed and one's behavior since the offense was committed or since the sentence. Applicants are required to obtain clearances from law enforcement in the communities in which they have lived, and are strongly urged to submit documentation showing stability and reform such as records of employment and any education or treatment programs completed, as well as character references.
A person with a past conviction can also be "deemed rehabilitated" by an immigration officer at the port of entry. Ten years must have elapsed since the conclusion of any sentence imposed and other criteria must be satisfied. Persons attempting to enter under the deemed rehabilitated system should also bring law enforcement clearances, documents showing a stable and reformed life, and character references, as the decision as to whether to admit someone as deemed rehabilitated is completely at the discretion of the border official and there is no recourse or right of appeal should deemed rehabilitated status be denied. It should be noted that anyone with a "felony" conviction (unless a pardon was granted) cannot be deemed rehabilitated and must instead apply for rehabilitation or a temporary resident permit.
Temporary resident permits.
Temporary resident permits are a one-time authorization for someone who is otherwise criminally inadmissible to enter Canada. Permits are rarely granted without cause, typically only in extenuating circumstances (such as a documented family emergency), on significant humanitarian grounds (such as sponsoring an inadmissible spouse or child), or for reasons of Canadian national interest, or in circumstances where the reasons for criminal inadmissibility are negligible. TRP's are usually issued with varying restrictions and can be revoked if deemed necessary.
Inadmissible family member.
If an individual is deemed inadmissible, members of his or her family "may" also be deemed inadmissible solely based on that fact.
Offenses committed as a minor.
In theory, a person is not inadmissible if they were convicted of a crime before the age of 18 and were tried as a young offender or through the juvenile justice system. If the person in question "could" have been tried as an adult (which is frequently the case in the US, where minors as young as 8 can be tried as an adult), regardless of whether they actually were or not, they are inadmissible.
Policies.
Importation of firearms.
Firearms are much more strictly controlled in Canada than in the U.S. Visitors bringing any firearms into Canada, or planning to borrow and use firearms while in Canada, are required to declare the firearms in writing using a Non-Resident Firearm Declaration form. Multiple firearms can be declared at the same time. Upon acceptance, this declaration serves as a temporary license and registration certificate for up to 60 days. The Non-Resident Firearm Declaration has a cost of $25 (Canadian). Visitors planning to borrow a firearm in Canada are required to obtain in advance a Temporary Firearms Borrowing License, the cost of which is $30 (Canadian), payable at the border. These forms are required to be signed before a CBSA officer at the border. Note that the forms are not available at the border itself. Details and downloadable forms are provided by the Canadian Firearms Program.
Canada has three classes of firearms: non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited. Non-restricted firearms include most ordinary hunting rifles and shotguns. These can be brought temporarily into Canada for sporting or hunting use during hunting season, use in competitions, in-transit movement through Canada, or personal protection against wildlife in remote areas of Canada. Any person wishing to bring a hunting rifle into Canada is required to be at least 18 years old, and the firearm must be properly stored for transport. Restricted firearms are primarily handguns. A restricted firearm may be brought into Canada, but an Authorization to Transport permit must be obtained in advance from a Chief Firearms Officer. Prohibited firearms include fully automatic, converted automatics and assault-type weapons. Prohibited firearms are not allowed into Canada. A comprehensive guide on importation of firearms and weapons is published by the CBSA.
It is recommended that the Canadian embassy or a consulate, or the Canadian Firearms Program be contacted for detailed information and instructions on temporarily importing firearms in advance of any travel. In all cases, travelers are required to declare to Canadian authorities any firearms and weapons in their possession when entering Canada. If a traveler is denied permission to bring in the firearm, there may be facilities near border crossings where firearms may be stored, pending the traveler's return to the U.S. Canadian law requires that officials confiscate firearms and weapons from those crossing the border that deny having them in their possession. Confiscated firearms and weapons are never returned. Possession of an undeclared firearm can result in a five-year prison sentence.
Items requiring declaration.
Food, plants, animals and related products are required to be declared when entering Canada using a declaration form. Once declared, a CBSA officer will ask questions about these items, such as their country of origin or intended use. The items may be inspected. Non-allowable items are either seized, disposed of, or ordered removed from Canada.
A failure to declare can lead to confiscation of products, fines of up to $400 (Canadian) per undeclared item, as well as prosecution. Persons wishing to dispose product needing declaration can do so in product disposal bins.
Prohibited items.
Electronic media of travelers entering Canada can be randomly checked. Computers are subject to search without a warrant at the border, and illegal content can result in the seizure of the computer as well as detention, arrest and prosecution of the bearer.
Certain weapons that may be legal to possess in the U.S. are prohibited weapons in Canada, most notably pepper spray, mace and Tasers. Under the Criminal Code of Canada, a person can face a maximum of five years in prison for unauthorized possession and five years for unauthorized importation of an illegal weapon. If, however, the Crown can prove that the person, despite knowing that its importation or possession is illegal, imports or possess a prohibited weapon, the maximum penalty increases to ten years imprisonment.
Canadian law prohibits the unlawful importation or trafficking of controlled substances and narcotics. A number of travelers, including Americans, have been arrested for attempting to smuggle khat, an herbal stimulant from East Africa, into Canada. Smugglers risk substantial fines, a permanent bar from Canada, and imprisonment.
It is recommended that prescription medicines be in their original prescription container. Suspicious looking or unidentifiable pills found during a search can be tested for narcotics. Entry into Canada can be delayed until the tests have completed. Moreover, their discovery can lead to being denied entry even if the tests passed.
Handling disagreements.
A person or organization may disagree with the CBSA about an assessment or decision made by the CBSA. If at the border, the Border Services Officer (BSO) or superintendent can be consulted. To address disagreements afterwards, a CBSA office can be contacted.
Appeals.
Persons who believe that they have not received their full entitlements under Canadian law, and have been unable to reach an agreement with the CBSA on a duty or penalty matter, have the right to a formal review of their file. A formal review is conducted by appeals representatives who were not involved in the original decision, and is impartial. Appeals staff are trained to review the client's and the CBSA's facts and reasons.
The role of the appeals representative who reviews a case is to carry out a complete, professional, and impartial review. This representative reviews the case by interpreting acts administered by the CBSA and reviewing CBSA policies, considering the appellant's point of view; and when necessary, asking for a technical opinion from CBSA experts or seeking legal advice from the Canadian Department of Justice.
The representative who reviews the case will not have been involved in the original assessment, determination, or ruling of a duty, penalty or other matter. The appellant can discuss the case with an appeals representative, and has have the right to obtain certain documents related to the case.
The CBSA does not charge for a review. If a person is not satisfied with the review, a further appeal can be made to the appropriate court or, to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal for relevant matters.
Business visits.
A business visitor is someone who comes to Canada to engage in international business activities without directly entering the Canadian labor market. Such visitors may be in Canada for business meetings or site visits (to observe only), but not to work. Business visitors are required to prove that their main source of income and their main place of business are outside Canada.
A visa is not required for a business visitor who is an American citizen. All business visitors are required to have a passport valid until the end of their stay, a letter of support from their parent company, a letter of invitation from the Canadian host business, a copy of any contracts or bills to support the visit, 24-hour contact details of the business host in Canada, and proof of enough money for both the stay in Canada and the return home. Business visitors do not need a temporary work permit unless they plan on doing executive, managerial, technical or production work.
Return entry into the U.S..
Documentation.
In the past, American citizens were permitted entry into the U.S. by oral declaration of citizenship. Beginning January 31, 2008, U.S. citizens aged 19 and older returning to the U.S. from Canada by land or water have had to present documents denoting citizenship and identity. Acceptable documentation includes a valid passport or government-issued photo identification such as a driver's license and proof of citizenship such as a birth certificate. U.S. citizens aged 18 and under need only to present a birth certificate. A list of acceptable documents is available at the website of the U.S. embassy in Canada.
Persons who do not present acceptable documents may be delayed as U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the port of entry attempt to verify identity and citizenship. Beginning in June 2009, all U.S. citizens will have to present a passport or other secure document that denotes identity and citizenship when entering the U.S. from Canada.
Having a passport card facilitates entry and expedites document processing. It carries the rights and privileges of the U.S. passport book for land and water crossings, but may not be used for air crossing.
Searches.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection has the authority from the U.S. Congress to conduct searches of persons and their baggage, cargo, and means of transportation entering the United States. Persons unhappy with their treatment can ask to speak to a supervisor immediately, or can make a complaint online.
Persons whose vehicles are searched can be asked to leave their phones in the car. There exists the potential of data on the phone being searched. As such, it may be recommended to secure access to one's phone while crossing the border.
Policies.
Certain items such as monetary instruments over U.S. $10,000, hunting trophies, and firearms require a declaration. Prescription medicines are required to be in their original prescription container. Prohibited items include absinthe, biological materials, Cuban cigars and other products of Cuba, endangered species and products thereof; explosives, including fireworks; some fruits, vegetables, and meats; narcotics and paraphernalia, pornographic materials, seditious or treasonable matter, and switchblade knives (except by one-armed persons). Pets must be accompanied with a valid rabies vaccination certificate.
Expedited entry.
Wait times for vehicles at popular border crossings can sometimes be excessive on either side of the border. It is recommended that the estimated wait time be checked in advance of travel. These are provided by both the CBSA and the CBP.
Both the U.S. and Canadian governments urge frequent travelers to join the NEXUS trusted traveler program. NEXUS members receive a card that allows expedited border crossings for both private and commercial travelers through both U.S. and Canadian border controls quickly.

The Glass Castle

The Glass Castle is a 2005 memoir by Jeannette Walls. The book recounts Walls' and her siblings' unconventional, poverty-stricken upbringing at the hands of their deeply dysfunctional parents.
The memoir spent a total of 261 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list and is now under development as a film by Paramount. By late 2007, "The Glass Castle" had sold over 2.5 million copies, had been translated into 22 languages, and received the Christopher Award, the American Library Association's Alex Award (2006) and the "Books for Better Living Award". 
Characters.
Jeannette Walls.
Jeannette Walls is the author and the voice of "The Glass Castle". The memoir is told from her point of view, beginning with her unconventional childhood (starting at the age of three) and culminating in her adult success as an editor, journalist, and writer. She is the second eldest out of four children.
Rex Walls.
Rex Walls was born in Welch, WV, and later joined the Air Force to get out of Welch. During his time in the Air Force, he met his wife Rose Mary. After the death of their second daughter, Mary, as an infant, Rex descended into alcoholism. 
Rex is bright and creative when not drinking; the title of the book comes from a promise that he makes throughout Jeannette's childhood that he will someday build the family a Glass Castle to live in, the blueprints for which he carries with him every time they move. Rex loves his family but is responsible for a great deal of chaos in their lives, uprooting them at a moment's notice to move to a new town, spending their already inadequate money on alcohol, and disappearing for days at a time. Although he is trained as a skilled worker, he rarely holds a job for longer than six months and often gets into trouble by arguing with authority figures. 
Rex always has projects in mind for getting rich quick, but these never lead anywhere. He occasionally brings in extra money by gambling; at one point he enlists Jeannette in hustling a pool player at a bar by letting the player believe she will provide sexual favors to him. He justifies this by saying he knew Jeannette could take care of herself.
Although Rex's contributions to his family have always been erratic, towards the end of the memoir, Rex comes up with $1000 for Jeannette's final year at Barnard College.
Rose Mary Walls.
Rose Mary is Rex's wife and the mother of Jeannette, Lori, Brian, and Maureen. She is an artist who loves to paint, but is also licensed as a teacher and is occasionally forced to take a teaching job when the family is on the brink of starvation with literally no money left. Even so, she sees taking teaching jobs as a betrayal of her true calling and never takes these jobs seriously, often refusing to go to work in the morning until her children cajole her into going. She occasionally tells her children that life would be much simpler if she didn't have four children to take care of.
By the end of the memoir, Rose Mary chooses to be homeless, seeing it as an adventure and refusing to take help from either of her grown daughters. Jeannette learns later that Rose Mary owns family land in Texas that is worth at least a million dollars, but never used this as a resource when her family was struggling. 
Lori Walls.
Lori Walls is the first child born to Rex and Rose Mary Walls. She is the first of the siblings to really question the way the family has been living, and decides she needs to leave home as soon as she can manage it. 
Lori and Jeannette work together to save money so that Lori can move to New York after her high school graduation, where she could get a job and send for Jeannette. Over a period of months, they save a sum of money in a piggy bank, but Rex steals it. Jeannette then receives a job offer from a family who is moving to Iowa and want her to come along to watch their children over the summer. Jeannette asks them to take Lori instead and pay for a bus ticket to New York at the end of it. 
Lori moves to New York City, and Jeannette joins her immediately after her junior year. In New York, Lori eventually becomes an illustrator
Brian Walls.
Brian Walls is the only son in the Walls family, the third of four children. He and Jeannette are the closest out of all the siblings. He helps Jeannette defend the siblings from local bullies. 
Immediately after his junior year of high school, Brian follows Jeannette and Lori to New York as well. He marries, starts a family, and becomes a cop, eventually rising to become a detective sergeant. Later he divorces his wife.
Maureen Walls.
Maureen is the youngest of the Walls children. As a young girl, Maureen spends most of her time in the homes of her friends, eating meals with them (since there is no food in the Walls home), and sleeping over at other people's houses whenever possible. 
Lori, Jeannette, and Brian bring Maureen to New York at the age of twelve. Shortly thereafter, their parents move to New York as well. Maureen eventually goes to live with her parents again, but attacks her mother with a knife when her mother tries to kick her out but she stayed there until Maureen was sent to a mental hospital for a year, and after she is released, she buys a one-way bus ticket to California. Jeannette states that she believes all Maureen ever wanted was for someone to take care of her.
Reception.
In The New York Times Book Review, critic and novelist Francine Prose wrote, "What's best is the deceptive ease with which Walls makes us see just how she and her siblings were convinced that their turbulent life was a glorious adventure. In one especially lovely scene, Rex takes his daughter to look at the starry desert sky and persuades her that the bright planet Venus is his Christmas gift to her. Even as she describes how their circumstances degenerated, how her mother sank into depression and how hunger and cold — and Rex's increasing irresponsibility, dishonesty and abusiveness — made it harder to pretend, Walls is notably evenhanded and unjudging...'The Glass Castle' falls short of being art, but it's a very good memoir. At one point, describing her early literary tastes, Walls mentions that 'my favorite books all involved people dealing with hardships.' And she has succeeded in doing what most writers set out to do — to write the kind of book they themselves most want to read."
Planned film adaptation.
Paramount bought the film rights to "The Glass Castle", and in March 2013 announced that actress Jennifer Lawrence would play Jeannette Walls in the movie adaptation. Claire Danes and Mark Ruffalo play Rose Mary and Rex Walls, respectively.

World War II.
Pławna was the location of Polish underground resistance attack on German military train conducted on the night of September 14, 1944 – a mishap, resulting from an unexpected change in train-schedule. The original German train with weapons and munitions – which was targeted by the Armia Krajowa intelligence, had been temporarily halted in Tuchów due to mechanical failure. Another train was let through a few hours later, carrying a Panzer division of the Wehrmacht, unknown to partisan unit of 100 men from the Battalion Barbara arriving from Zborów. The railway tracks were blown up only to realize the terrible mistake. The Polish soldiers retreated immediately under heavy enemy fire, with four casualties. The train returned to Tarnów; but the very next day, half the innocent village was burned down by the German "SS" in reprisal.

Siemiechów (population: 1,873 as of 2003), is a village located in the low Carpathian mountains of South-Eastern Poland in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. It lies approximately north-west of Gromnik, south of Tarnów, and east of the regional capital Kraków.
Location.
Siemiechów, or Siemichów, a village in the Wielicki Highlands situated between the Wału (526 m) and the Suchy (370 meters) mountain ranges, in the district Tarnowski, by the stream Brzozowski (left tributary of the river Dunajec) and along the main road from Zakliczyn to Gromnik (by the river Biała, 5 klm.), its elevation is from 245 to 260 meters above sea level, consisting of its own villages and hamlets: Góry Wielkie, Góry Małe, Łęk, Moszczenice and Wiesiołka. Similarly, the area of greater property shares three segments: Siemiechów, Leśniczówkę and Dybówkę. The entire settlement (in 1890) numbers 247 homes (11 in the area of greater property) and 1595 residents (769 males, 826 females); 1547 Roman Catholics and 48 Jews. The area of greater property consists of 579 morgs of fields, 6 morgs of meadows, 14 morgs of pastures and 511 morgs of forest; the area of lesser property consists of 1687 morgs of fields, 132 morgs of meadows, 310 morgs of pastures and 307 morgs of forest. The village is in a beautiful location and there are many possibilities for excursion activities in the Siemiechów area, which is known for tourism and relaxation.
History 1200–1800.
The Tatars, on their way to Tuchów (22 kilometers North-East of Siemiechów) during the Tatar invasion of 1241, murdered 7 monks ("siedem mnichów") among other people and from this was the origin of the name "Siedmichów", later changed to "Siemiechów". The village was officially established on September 29, 1326 by King Władysław Łokietek "na surowym korzeniu" ("from fresh roots" or "from the ground up") under German law and equally began to form a parish on "dwoma łanami ziemi" ("2 łanow of land).
In the village is a wooden parish church and public school. The first mention of the existence of a parish was in 1349. The school was established before 1596. The sacred Gothic wooden church, "Matki Boskiej Gromnicznej" ("The Virgin Mary of Candles") was built before 1470. It was rebuilt in 1585 from contributions donated by 'Jan of Mstowa'. The church is of hand-made construction, contains one nave, and in a closed trilateral presbytery. Adjacent to it on the southern side is the Late Baroque brick chapel, square with rounded angles, the interior set with a flat ceiling, on the entrance is a gothic carpenter's portal in "oślimi grzbietami" (curved arch style), and was built in 1800. Inside the church, most of the furnishings came from the 15th to 17th century period, which includes: a statue of the 'Virgin Mary' from 1480, a stone font containing the coat of arms of Pilawa and Gierałt from the 15th century, a 15th-century crucifix, two monumental bells from the 16th century built in the workshop of Szymon Haubicz in Brno, and old fixtures and locks. The interior polychrome walls of the 16th/17th century, were painted by Łukasz Wadowski in 1643, and in 1726, the furnishings of the 16th - 18th centuries. The Church later underwent prime restoration from 1955 to 1956. From 1929 to 1953, a new brick parish church, "Ofiarowania Wszystkich Świętych i Wniebowstąpienia Pana Jezusa" ("Offering in the Temple and Ascension of Our Lord Jesus"), was constructed in the Neorenaissance style. In the war cemetery stands a brick chapel which was built in 1915. The parish belongs to the Tarnowski diocese and Tuchowski deanery. According to Jan Długosz (L. B., III, 216), the village of 'Szemychów' had a parish at an early time and belonged to the Abbey of Tyniec (near Kraków) by virtue of privilege of King Casimir III in 1354, however, Spytek of Melsztyn took away the monastery by force, shortly before the Battle of Worskła in 1398, in which he then died "...and fair justice was served for what was taken, that which belonged to somebody else...". Later, in his second reference (II, 276) Długosz quietly mentions that Siemiechów belongs to the Abbey of Tyniec.
In 1581, in 'Sziemichow' (Pawinśki, Małopolskie, 118) there was a 'sołtys' (village administrator) belonging to Siemiechów, who counted in the village: 1 wealthy farmer owning 25 'łanow' of land, 10 small farms without fields, 3 bailiffs who own cattle, 8 bailiffs without cattle, 4 craftsmen, and the village administrator who owns 1 'łana' of land.
The village boundaries are: to the West is Faściszowa, to the East is Gromnik, to the South is Brzozowa, and to the North along a large beech forest is Łubinka.
Located in the province of Krakowskie, district Biecki, according to records of the treasury from 1770 it was noted that the village of Siemiechów in the province and 3 'folwark' (granges), during that time, was owned by Ignacy Krasiński, and he paid an annual military tax of 1266 złp. / 17 gr., and a winter military tax of 458 złp. / 12 gr. Ignacy, the third son of Jan (castellan of Wizna, near Łomza), and Ewa Trojanowska, brother of Adam (a bishop), and Michał Hieronim Krasiński (great-grandfather of world famous Polish poet, Count Zygmunt Krasiński). In 1769, he received governorship of Siemiechów, in the district of Biecz, from his first wife, Maryanna Krasińska Jordanów (kancl. 40 f. 14). Due to the Office of Assessments court assessors, he resigned in 1788 (M. 301 f. 46). He became a bachelor (got divorced) from the order of St. Stanisław which he received in 1786. The heir of the Oblas of Radom, he got married for the second time in 1774 to Agnieszka Potkańska, castellan of Radom, and had a daughter, Anna, whose first marriage was to Kazimierz Walicki, governor of Sochaczew, and second marriage to Mikołaj of Oplów Bronikowski, general major in the royal military, in which he wrote his life testimony in 1795 (DW. 110 f. 1299 i 111 f. 826). Amelia, one daughter of Bronikowski, got married to Count Roman Załuski. During the period of the ruling Austrian government in 1772, the administration stole the entire estate from Kraśinski and then forced him to buy it back from them in 1789 at a very high price.

Landing at Saidor

The Landing at Saidor (Operation MICHAELMAS) was an Allied amphibious landing at Saidor, Papua New Guinea on 2 January 1944 as part of Operation Dexterity during World War II. In Allied hands, Saidor was a stepping stone towards Madang, the ultimate objective of General Douglas MacArthur's Huon Peninsula campaign. The capture of the airstrip at Saidor also allowed construction of an air base to assist Allied air forces to conduct operations against Japanese bases at Wewak and Hollandia. But MacArthur's immediate objective was to cut off the 6,000 Imperial Japanese troops retreating from Sio in the face of the Australian advance from Finschhafen. Following the landing at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over the foothills of the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese soldiers involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them. After considerable construction effort in the face of wet weather, the air base was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.
Background.
Fighting in the South West Pacific Area in late 1943 and early 1944 was dominated by General Douglas MacArthur's Operation CARTWHEEL, a series of operations directed at isolating and neutralising Rabaul, the main base of the Imperial Japanese forces in the South West Pacific area. MacArthur's original ELKTON III plan called for Australian troops to capture first Lae, then Finschhafen, and finally Madang with a combination of airborne and amphibious assaults. However, it was a long way from Finschhafen to Madang — . Thinking in terms of a shore-to-shore operation, which would be limited in radius of action to the distance that landing craft could sail in one night, the Commander of Allied Land Forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey recommended in August 1943 that an intermediate objective be seized first. Saidor was chosen as it had accessible beaches, a harbour, and a pre-war airstrip, and was allocated the GHQ codename MICHAELMAS. It was recognised that the capture of Saidor might make that of Madang unnecessary, as both could cover the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits, and both would provide air bases close to the Japanese base at Wewak. For the time being though, both were considered objectives.
The Battle of Finschhafen prevented the early occupation of Saidor. The Japanese wrested back the initiative and threatened to derail MacArthur's strategy, but ultimately failed to dislodge the Australian 9th Division or prevent the occupation of the Finschhafen area. With the battle of Finschhafen won, the 9th Division initiated a pursuit of Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's retreating Japanese Eighteenth Army on 5 December 1943. Adachi was now in a difficult and precarious position, attempting to conduct a fighting withdrawal with his inland right flank vulnerable to attack from the Australian 7th Division in the Ramu Valley and his seaborne left flank open to amphibious assault. That he had an opportunity to destroy Adachi's army was not lost on MacArthur, who decided on 10 December that Saidor should be seized on or about 7 January, provided that Operation BACKHANDER was proceeding satisfactorily. On 17 December, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, the commander of the ALAMO Force, received orders setting a target date for Saidor of 2 January 1944.
Preparation.
General Krueger selected the 32nd Infantry Division for the Saidor operation as it was at Goodenough Island but no longer required for the New Britain campaign. The assistant division commander, Brigadier General Clarence A. Martin was appointed commander of MICHAELMAS Task Force, which was built around the 126th Infantry Regimental Combat Team. The 126th Regimental Combat Team had been rebuilt after the Battle of Buna-Gona and had received six weeks' amphibious training in Australia and a further three weeks' training at Milne Bay. Units assigned to the task force were at Goodenough Island, Milne Bay, Oro Bay, Lae, Finschafen, Port Moresby, Kiriwina, Arawe, Cape Cretin, and Australia.
The mission of MICHAELMAS Task Force was to (1) seize the Saidor area; (2) establish facilities for a fighter group; (3) assist in the establishment of air forces in the area; (4) assist in the establishment of light naval forces in the area; and (5) construct minimal port and base facilities. Notably, it did not contain any explicit instruction to fight the Japanese. Lieutenant General Frank Berryman's Australian II Corps would cooperate by exploitation along the coast, while the Australian 7th Division would contain Japanese forces in the Bogadjim area by fighting patrols.
Maps were supplied by the Australian Survey Corps. There was insufficient time and opportunity for ground reconnaissance, so three beaches, codenamed Red, White, and Blue, on the west shore of Dekays Bay were chosen from aerial photographs. They proved to be "narrow, rocky and exposed to heavy seas". The intelligence staff at GHQ in Brisbane believed that there were no more than 4,500 Japanese forward of Sio, and only 1,500 more between there and the Madang area. They estimated that if the Japanese decided to counter-attack at Saidor, they would take a week to bring up 3,000 men. Accordingly, General Martin elected to dispense with a preliminary aerial bombardment. Removing this requirement permitted a dawn landing.
The assault troops with their supplies and equipment had to be loaded on board the ships on 31 December 1943, just five days after the assault on Cape Gloucester. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force allotted 6 Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs), 10 High speed transports (APDs) and 17 Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs). A last minute hitch developed on 30 December when it was discovered that only nine APDs would be available. New embarkation tables were drawn up, shifting personnel not required in the assault waves to LCIs, and the landing schedule was revised in the light of the reduced number of landing craft. 
The difficulty of simultaneously supplying operations at Saidor, Arawe, Long Island, and Cape Gloucester was sufficiently daunting for General Krueger to request for a postponement of the Saidor operation. But the commander of the Allied Naval Forces and the United States Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid assured MacArthur that enough supplies would be delivered, and MacArthur overruled Krueger. "I am most anxious that if humanly possible this operation take place as scheduled," MacArthur informed him, "Its capture will have a vital strategic effect which will be lost if materially postponed."
Operations.
Landing.
The ships and landing craft arrived at Dekays Bay before dawn on 2 January 1944 to find the shore obscured by low hanging clouds and drizzling rain. Admiral Barbey postponed H-Hour from 0650 to 0705 to provide more light for the naval bombardment, and then to 0725 to allow the landing craft more time to form up. Destroyers fired 1,725 5-inch rounds, while rocket-equipped LCIs fired 624 4.5-inch rockets. There was no concurrent aerial bombardment, but Fifth Air Force B-24 Liberators, B-25 Mitchells and A-20 Havocs bombed Saidor airstrip later that morning.
The first wave reached the shore at about 0730. The first four waves of landing craft — LCP(R)s from the APDs — arrived over the next 15 minutes. Each of the six LSTs in the assault towed a Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade; two carried bulldozers, two carried rocket equipped DUKWs, and two carried spare diesel fuel. The LCMs beached shortly before 0830 and the LSTs soon after. The Shore Battalion, 542nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment laid Australian ARC mesh to provide a roadway across the beach for vehicles. All six LSTs were unloaded by 1145. There was little opposition. Eleven Japanese soldiers were killed by the naval bombardment or assault troops. Perhaps as many as 150 transient Japanese troops were in the Saidor area, all of whom fled into the interior. American D-Day casualties came to one soldier killed and five wounded, and two sailors drowned. Nine Japanese Nakajima Ki-49 (Helen) aircraft, escorted by up to twenty A6M Zero (Zeke) and Kawasaki Ki-61 (Tony) fighters bombed the beach area at 1630. There were three more air raids during the night, and 49 over the course of the month, but most were small. 
General MacArthur announced the landing in his communiqué the next day:
Japanese response.
Since October 1943, the Japanese strategy had been to conduct a fighting withdrawal in the face of MacArthur's advance that would "trade position, to the end that the enemy offensive will be crushed as far forward as possible under the accumulation of losses". At General Hitoshi Imamura's Japanese Eighth Area Army headquarters at Rabaul, the staff debated whether the 20th and 51st Divisions should attack Saidor or slip past it and join up with the rest of the Eighteenth Army at Wewak. In view of the poor condition of the 20th and 51st Divisions, Imamura relieved the Eighteenth Army of responsibility for the Sio area and ordered Adachi to withdraw to Madang.
General Adachi had flown from Madang to the 51st Division's headquarters at Kiari in late December, and he received word of the landing at Saidor shortly before heading overland to the 20th Division's headquarters at Sio, where he received Imamura's orders. He placed Lieutenant General Hidemitsu Nakano of the 51st Division in overall command of the forces east of Saidor and ordered the 41st Division to move from Wewak to Madang to defend that area. He then departed for Madang by submarine. To harass Saidor, he withdrew eight companies from Major General Masutaro Nakai's force facing Major General Alan Vasey's Australian 7th Division in the Finisterres. The Nakai force deployed along the Mot River around Gambumi. It succeeded in repelling American attempts to cross the river until 21 February, when it withdrew, its mission complete. However, weakening the Finisterres front provoked an Australian attack, resulting in the loss of the entire Kankirei position.
General Nakano organised the withdrawal of his force. He chose two routes, one following the coast and the other running along the ridge lines of the foothills of the Finisterres. Initially, the 20th Division was to take the coastal route while the 51st and some naval units took the inland one, but this was changed at the last minute and both divisions took the inland route. Additional rations and supplies were to be delivered by submarine. However, the 51st Division elected to move out rather than wait for the submarines and risk exhausting its rations through waiting. The 51st Division had experience crossing the mountains before, and Nakano was confident of its ability to negotiate them. In the event, one submarine was discovered by Allied aircraft and failed to reach its objective, while a second was discovered and sunk. A third got through but it was a small type that was only able to carry five tons of supplies, which were distributed among units of the 20th Division.
The difficulty of the march had been underestimated, and sick and wounded men had to make their way through trackless regions. Lieutenant General Kane Yoshihara, the Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Army, recalled the march:
The first troops reached Madang on 8 February, and the whole movement was complete by 23 February. Eighteenth Army anticipated that units reaching Madang, would probably have lost much of their equipment, as was indeed the case, so stores were gathered together from distant Wewak and Hansa, and collected together near Madang. In addition emergency articles such as some food, shoes and clothing were collected near the mouth of Minderi River, supplied by the Nakai Detachment.
Junction with the Australians.
In his report, Krueger stated:
American patrols which attempted to reach the track in the Sindaman area encountered aggressive Japanese patrols. An observation post in the mountains at Mambit counted 965 Japanese troops passing through Yagoyoga between 6 and 10 February and 2,613 between 11 and 23 February. Perhaps another 1,000 passed through before 6 February. From prisoners of war, the Task Force built up a fairly complete and accurate picture of the identity and strength of the opposing Japanese forces. On 12 January, Martin received intelligence from ALAMO Force to the effect that the Japanese were concentrating around Sio, and would attempt to force their way through to Madang. In response to a request from General Martin for reinforcements, the 1st and 3rd Battalion Combat Teams of the 128th Infantry were sent to reinforce Saidor, arriving on 16 January. Martin came to believe that an advance to the east and an attack on the withdrawing enemy would "provide an opportunity to destroy the Japanese before they could organise an attack on the Saidor position", but General Krueger did not immediately give General Martin permission for such an operation. There was still the possibility of Japanese attack, and the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation. On 20 January, a visiting staff officer from ALAMO Force was asked to raise the possibility with Krueger. However, on 21 January Martin received a letter stating that the mission of the Task Force remained unchanged and a radiogram was received on 22 January to the effect that this was not consistent with Krueger's wishes. On 8 February, Martin received a garbled radiogram from Krueger that indicated that the earlier restrictive message of 22 January had itself been garbled, and on 9 February a radiogram was received authorising offensive action. Plans were immediately made but on 10 February contact was made with elements of the Australian 5th Division, which had relieved the 9th Division on 20 January. This closed the gap on the east flank. 
Base Development.
With a large construction programme, engineers made up 29.3% of MICHAELMAS Task Force. An Engineer Section headquarters was organised on 24 December 1943, only nine days before D-Day, consisting of five officers and five enlisted men. Later a jeep and a driver were borrowed from the 114th Engineer Battalion to provide transportation. The officers did not know each other and therefore were unaware of each other's capabilities. As it turned out, none of them had experience with amphibious operations, and only one had experience in airbase construction, although this was to be their most important task. 
Saidor had an existing grass civilian airstrip. Before they had abandoned Saidor in 1942, Australian troops had sabotaged the airstrip by digging trenches across the runway. These were quickly filled in, and the overgrown Kunai grass was knocked down by driving 2½-ton trucks over it. By the afternoon of 4 January, of runway was ready for use. A Piper Cub took off from it the next day. The 863rd Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived on 9 January and improved the strip, permitting twelve C-47 Skytrains loaded with ammunition to land on 11 January. ALAMO Force wanted an all-weather runway by , preferably where a second, parallel runway could be constructed if need be. Construction of the second runway was requested by the Fifth Air Force on 24 January. The 8th Engineer Squadron survey detachment laid out a new runway oriented about 10° from the existing airstrip. The Task Force engineer had the entire site stripped, leaving the subgrade exposed. This was a serious error, as from 10 to 31 January there were only three days during which it did not rain, and of rain fell over the period — quite normal for the time of year. As a result, construction was delayed. Gravel was taken from the Nankina River which was laid up to deep and topped with crushed aggregate. The rains, and frequent rolling, gave a good water-bound surface. Part was sealed with Bitumen but delays caused by the weather prevented it all being sealed before being overlaid with Marston mats. The runway was declared ready for emergency landings on 4 February but the surface deteriorated under use. The runway was finally completed on 6 March. Construction of the taxiways and dispersal areas continued through April, with the airbase being complete and in operation on 7 May. 
On 5 March, the engineers began construction of the bulk petroleum installation. Storage was provided for of avgas in one tank and five tanks. A fuel jetty was constructed, allowing tankers to discharge into a pipeline which ran over a catwalk to the storage tanks. Work was completed on 8 April. Considerable effort had to be expended on road construction. The 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion had to be assigned to road work, the task being beyond the resources of the Shore Battalion. Gravel was laid up to thick. By late January, the weather and damage to the roads by heavy military traffic forced the engineers to impose a ban on morning road use. By midday the sun had dried out the roads and traffic could resume. Initially, the Nakina River could be forded but the heavy seasonal rains turned it into a fast-flowing torrent. A portable bridge was flown in from Milne Bay and erected in a day but it took two weeks to construct the approaches. In the meantime the troops on the other side had to be supplied by water. To open up the most suitable area for camp sites, another bridge had to be erected over the Nakina. This was a permanent bridge with concrete abutments. A rise in the river level of complicated work, but the bridge opened to traffic on 17 February.
Local labour was supplied by an Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) detachment, initially consisting of eight Australian Army officers and eleven native police. A week after the landing, 199 native labourers were brought in from Lae. Initially, the ANGAU detachment found it difficult to lure the frightened local people in from the bush, but as the word spread that there was food and safety to be had within the American perimeter, large numbers began to walk in. ANGAU established a native settlement in the Biding River area. By 13 February, 680 native labourers were at work. They constructed camps for the Americans, carried supplies to units in the mountains and brought back the wounded, and worked in the hospital. ANGAU also carried out patrols, providing intelligence on the Japanese positions. 
The amphibian engineers had brought six LCMs on the first day. These were joined by another six towed by the six LSTs that arrived on the second day. Unfortunately, within days the rocky beaches and reefs caused nine to be damaged so badly that they had to be sent back to Cape Cretin for repairs. Later in January, the rest of B Company, 542nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment was sent to Saidor. A lighter wharf was begun on 19 January and completed on 5 March. The unseasoned local timber used in its construction soon took a battering from heavily loaded barges bumping into them in high seas and had to be replaced with steel piles. A liberty ship wharf was completed on 6 May. Other construction activities included jetties for servicing PT boats, landings for LSTs, a 250–bed hospital opened on 11 May, a quartermaster dump, and a staging area for 9,000.
Air Operations.
Saidor was soon in use by the Fifth Air Force. Its base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, but there was no such problem at Saidor. During March, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia. A raid on Hollandia on 16 April 1944 encountered a weather front that closed Nadzab and the other fields in the Markham Valley. More than 30 aircraft made their way to Saidor. An F-5 Lightning and a B-25 Mitchell collided on the runway, and two aircraft cracked up on landing, but the other aircraft that made it to Saidor eventually returned to their bases.
Conclusion.
Krueger reported that "MICHAELMAS Task Force tried hard to block these escape routes. But the torrential rain, the ruggedness of the country with its impenetrable rain forests and jungles and impassable rivers, and the resistance of enemy troops pushed forward from Madang to guard the trails leading eastward, made this effort fall short of success". Australian commanders were critical. In a letter to Blamey, Berryman, who had visited Krueger in an attempt to ensure that the Japanese would not escape, wrote that "about 8,000 semi-starved, ill-equipped and dispirited Japanese bypassed Saidor. It was disappointing that the fruits of victory were not fully reaped, and that once again the remnants of the 51st Division escaped our clutches." Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead of New Guinea Force reported to Blamey that MICHAELMAS Task Force appeared not to have made "any appreciable effort" to cut off the retreating Japanese. Sadly for the men of the 32nd Infantry Division, many of these Japanese would later have to be fought again under less advantageous circumstances in the Battle of Driniumor River. Krueger officially terminated Operation DEXTERITY, of which MICHAELMAS was a part, on 10 February 1944. All that remained now was the final act of the Huon Peninsula campaign: the capture of Madang.
Casualties.
In the Australian 5th Division's advance from Sio to Saidor between 20 January and the end of February, 734 Japanese were killed, 1,793 found dead, and 48 Japanese prisoners were taken. Australian and Papuan casualties came to 3 killed and 5 wounded. The US 32nd Infantry Division at Saidor killed 119 Japanese and captured 18, while losing 40 killed, 11 wounded, 16 missing.

Wendouree railway station

Wendouree railway station is a passenger-only station on the Ballarat and Ararat railway lines, located in the western Ballarat suburb of Wendouree, Victoria approximately 100 metres west of the Gillies Street level crossing.
When opened in 2010 Wendouree station became one of just two functioning passenger railway stations in urban Ballarat and a terminus for many trains on the Ballarat railway line. Areas serviced include Wendouree, Alfredton, Lake Gardens, Lake Wendouree, Learmonth, Miners Rest and other nearby areas which have a combined population of approximately 27,000.
The station currently receives 13 weekday trains, or 73 a week, and is used for around 24,000 passenger trips a year.
History.
There was a railway station at Wendouree until the early 1980s. It was sited just west of the Forest street level crossing, and about a kilometre east of the present station. At Gillies Street, near the site of the current station stood a 19th-century signal box, which was used junction of the main railway to Ararat and the Ballarat Cattle Yards railway line. After falling into disrepair the Public Transport Commission was approached by Kim Lynden who later successfully tendered to move the building to Blampied near Daylesford to become a bed and breakfast in 1998.
Current Station.
A new railway station was initially planned by the Government of Victoria in response to congestion at Ballarat railway station resulting from a passenger boom following the completion of the Regional Fast Rail project in 2006. The construction of the new station provided a commuter rail service for people in Ballarat's western suburbs and nearby townships travelling to Melbourne's Central Activities District.
The station was announced in September 2006, and was due for completion in 2008. The name was the subject of a competition which closed in April 2007 the winner of which was Joan Munson.
The contract to build was awarded in 2008 to Melbourne civil engineering firm Cut and Fill, with work started in May that year. Artists impressions released to the public in August 2008 depicted a sleek, modern building with red and grey panels and a sloping roof.
The final cost of construction was A$18.7 million.
It was officially opened by Public Transport Minister Lynne Kosky on Thursday, 11 June 2009 in a Ribbon-cutting ceremony ceremony at the station after which a mural by Ratartat and students from Yuille Park Community College featuring local landmarks and public transport themes was also unveiled.
It opened to passengers on Sunday 14 June 2009.
Initially eleven services a day were run to the station, made up of three services originating at the station in morning peak, two afternoon peak services terminating at the station, and six Ararat services (three in each direction) stopping at the station. From 26 July 2010 the number of services per day was increased by two.
24,118 passengers used the station in the 13 months after opening. During the 2010 Victorian election campaign, the Liberal candidate for the seat of Ballarat West, Craig Coltman, declared that a Coalition government would ensure that all Ballarat rail services ran to and from Wendouree, and that Protective Services Officers would be posted there "from 6am to the last train and patrolling the carpark too".
Facilities.
Wendouree railway station has an air-conditioned and heated main building, platform, 200-space car park, bus and taxi bays and bike racks and lockers.

Arthur Du Cros

Sir Arthur Philip Du Cros, 1st Baronet (26 January 1871 – 28 October 1955) was a British industrialist and politician.
Early life and business career.
He was born in Dublin, the third of seven sons of Harvey du Cros. He grew up in modest conditions; his father, later a well-known manufacturer, was at the time only a bookkeeper with an income of £170 a year. He attended a national school in Dublin and then entered the civil service at the lowest-paid grade. In 1892 he joined the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency Ltd, of which his father was now the chairman, and was made a joint managing director in 1896 when it was first traded as a public company.
In 1895 he married Maude Gooding, the daughter of a Coventry watch manufacturer; they had two sons and two daughters before a divorce in 1923.
In 1901 Du Cros founded the Dunlop Rubber Company, converting of land in Birmingham henceforth known as Fort Dunlop for the production and manufacture of tyres. Dunlop subsequently purchased the goodwill and trading rights of Du Cros' Pneumatic Tyre Company and diversified into making other rubber products in addition to tyres. To ensure the company's supply of rubber Du Cros secured plantations in Malaya and Ceylon; by 1917 Dunlop owned about of rubber-producing land.
Political career.
In 1906 Du Cros entered politics, unsuccessfully contesting the seat of Bow & Bromley as a Conservative candidate, a seat to which his brother was elected in 1910. In 1908 he was elected Member of Parliament for Hastings, a position his father had immediately before.
In 1909 he formed (and was the director of) the Parliamentary Aerial Defence Committee to ensure funding for military aeronautical development, of which he was a strong proponent. During the First World War he worked for the Ministry of Munitions on an honorary basis, buying two motorised ambulance convoys with his own money and helping form an infantry battalion, being a former captain of the Royal Warwickshires and for some years being the honorary colonel of the 8th battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. Following the death of Edward VII, Daisy Warwick attempted to blackmail King George V to prevent the release of love letters to the media that she claimed proved Edward VII's adultery. After the High Court, restrained her from publishing the letters in Britain, she threatened to sell them to American media. Du Cros offered to pay £64,000 (2012: £6,190,545) worth of Daisy's debts in return for the love letters and for his generosity, he was created a baronet in 1916. He continued to represent Hastings until 1918, when he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Clapham, a position he resigned four years later.
House attacked by suffragettes.
On 14 April 1913 Du Cros' home at St Leonards was burnt down by suffragettes angry at his opposition to votes for women. Contemporary newsreels reported the estimated cost of the damage to be £10,000.
Later life.
His later career featured much financial impropriety. He found it difficult to distinguish between personal and company assets, using company funds to sponsor family investments and appointing family members to senior position without regard for merit. He also participated in financial manipulation as a close associate of James White, a financier who specialised in share rigging and whose actions left Dunlop close to bankruptcy in 1921. Du Cros had already lost influence within the company and was dismissed after the 1921 depression.

Rocrail

Rocrail is an Open Source Project that can control a model train layout from one or more computers. You can run trains directly from your computer, and you can have the computer run trains automatically for you. You can even have some of the trains on your layout running automatically while you control others by hand.
Architecture.
Rocrail uses two main programs, a server and a client. These programs work with each other using TCP/IP, and do not need to be on the same computer. You can use Rocrail from a single computer connected directly to your layout, and you can also control your layout from any computer on your home network, or over the Internet. Rocrail also has a HTTP interface, which will let you run the layout from a web browser. (PDA/SDA) PDA and Smartphone apps are available.
The server program runs on a computer connected to the layout by one of the standard computer interface setups, and supports many command stations.
The Rocrail client connects to the server over your network. The client can also be used by itself to plan layouts. You do not need the Server or the layout to be running to edit your plans. Plans can be uploaded to the server after you are done creating them.
Rocrail runs under both Windows and Linux operating systems (uses the wxWidgets toolkits).
A partial list of Supported Command Stations and Protocols.
The above is a small partial list. 
Users.

Railway Construction Act 1884

The Victorian Government's Act No. 821, Railway Construction Act 1884, authorised the construction of 59 new railway lines. Created by the Minister for Railways, Thomas Bent, and passed on 12 December 1884, it became notorious for the excessive number of inner-city railways it created, and received the nickname "the Octopus Act". The depression of the 1890s soon rendered many of these lines unviable.
Implementation.
The task of implementing the act fell to Richard Speight, Railway Commissioner at the time, a role created by the Victorian Railways Commissioners Act of 1883. 
Beneficiaries of the act included construction engineers such as Andrew O'Keefe, and politicians such as Thomas Bent himself, who reaped the rewards of commissioning construction in their own electorates.
Construction of the lines was complete by April 1890.
By 1892, outrage at the excesses of this construction boom, including a number of "white elephants", led to the sacking of Speight, Richard Ford and A J Agg, the other commissioners. Then, the Railways Act of 1892, attempted to reverse some of the damage.

Tikitiki

Tikitiki is a small town in Waiapu Valley on the north bank of the Waiapu River in the Gisborne Region of the North Island of New Zealand. The area in which the town resides was formerly known as "Kahukura". By road, Tikitiki is north-northeast of Gisborne, northeast by north of Ruatōria, and south by east of Te Araroa. The name of the town comes from the full name of Māui, Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga (Māui wrapped in the topknot of Taranga). State Highway 35 passes through the town at the easternmost point of the New Zealand State Highway network.
The town is from the smaller town of Rangitukia, near the mouth of the Waiapu River. These towns historically had a racecourse, four rugby teams, and several shops fuelled by a thriving dairy industry. In the 1950s and 60s the towns had a combined population of 6,000, but economic downturn in the area in the mid to late 60s led to urban drift, and 2011 figures put the population of both towns at 528. 95% of the towns' inhabitants identify as Māori. Most people in these towns are either homemakers, or employed in the roading, forestry, farming, or food industries, or as office workers.
Landmarks.
According to "" "Tikitiki’s jewel" is St. Mary's church. It is non-denominational but has historic links to the Anglican Church and is therefore essentially an Anglican. Built from 1924 to 1926 under the guidance of Sir Āpirana Ngata to remember the Ngāti Porou soldiers who fought and died in World War I, and to commemorate the establishment of Christianity in Waiapu Valley and the East Coast. The church, which integrates Māori architecture into its design, contains references to the fallen soldiers within its extensive carvings, tukutuku, and stained glass windows. St Mary's church is of great spiritual and historical significance to Ngāti Porou, and is classified as a Category I Historic Place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.
Above and behind the church is a hill containing the remains of a fortified pā called Pukemaire. The pā dates back to pre-European times, and by 1865 was occupied by followers of the syncretic Christian Māori religion, Pai Mārire. That year, as part of the New Zealand Wars, the pā was attacked by both colonial forces and Ngāti Porou forces loyal to the New Zealand Government (called kūpapa). This was one of the last confrontations between Pai Mārire and Ngāti Porou. While the majority of the area inside the pā's defensive perimeter has been ploughed many times, the eastern end behind St Mary's Church has been left intact, where the remains of kūmara storage pits can be seen.
Education.
Tikitiki has a co-educational full primary school called Tikitiki School or Pae-O-Te-Riri School. The name Pae-O-Te-Riri means "Resting place of a war party on the march". The school was opened in 1887 as a Māori school, and originally had approximately 300 students. This number has dropped substantially, and in May 2012, the school roll stood at 27 students.

Walter G. Alexander

Walter Gilbert Alexander (December 3, 1880 – February 5, 1953) was an African-American physician and Republican Party politician from New Jersey. He was president of the National Medical Association and the first African American to serve in the New Jersey Legislature.
Early life and career.
Alexander was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1880, the son of former slaves. He attended public schools in Lynchburg and entered Lincoln University in Chester County, Pennsylvania in 1895 at the age of 14. He graduated in 1899 and then attended the Boston College of Physicians and Surgeons (now Tufts University School of Medicine), receiving his M.D. in 1903. After practicing medicine for one year in Kimball, West Virginia, he opened a practice in Orange, New Jersey, where he resided for the rest of his life.
From 1906 to 1912, Alexander served as vice president of the New Jersey National Medical Association, and in 1907 he organized the North Jersey Medical Society. He was an active member of the National Medical Association (NMA), the largest and oldest national organization representing African-American physicians in the United States. He assisted in the founding of the "Journal of the National Medical Association" in 1908. Dr. Alexander was a founding member of the Oranges and Maplewood Unit of the NAACP. This Unit was the first NAACP established in New Jersey. He served as general secretary of the NMA from 1912 to 1924 (and again from 1928 to 1932), as president from 1925 to 1926, and as chairman of the board of trustees from 1942 to 1944. He received the NMA's distinguished service award in 1944.
Political career.
Alexander became involved in Essex County politics, serving on the Republican County Committee in 1911. In 1912, he was a candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly on the Progressive Party ticket with Theodore Roosevelt, making him the first African American in the state to have a regular party endorsement for a legislative seat. In 1914, he was a candidate for City Commissioner of Orange, receiving the eleventh highest vote total in a field of 54 candidates. In 1919, Alexander was an unsuccessful candidate for the Assembly on Essex County's Republican League ticket.
In 1920, Alexander won election to the Assembly, on a twelve-person Republican slate in Essex County that also included the first two women elected to the New Jersey Legislature, Margaret B. Laird and Jennie C. Van Ness. In March 1921, Alexander was appointed to serve as acting Speaker of the Assembly while Speaker George S. Hobart was attending a National Guard investigation. It marked the first time that an African American had acted in this capacity, though an African American would not be elected to the speakership until 1974, when S. Howard Woodson was chosen for the position. He won re-election to the Assembly later in 1921. 
Alexander was selected as alternate-at-large to the 1924 Republican National Convention. Four years later, the Republican State Committee selected him as one of seven delegates-at-large to the 1928 Republican National Convention.
Later life.
Alexander maintained close ties to his alma mater, Lincoln University, serving as graduate manager of athletics from 1920 to 1926, president of the General Alumni Association from 1931 to 1936, and member of the Board of Trustees in 1936. In 1939 the university awarded him an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.
On October 13, 1926, Alexander along with 12 other individuals co-founded Alpha Alpha Lambda (ΑΑΛ), the first New Jersey chapter of the African-American fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha (ΑΦΑ).
He was appointed the president of the New Jersey Tuberculosis League. He was also a member of the state Public Health Council, the Committee on Health and Welfare under Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, and the medical advisory committee of the National Youth Administration.
Alexander died in 1953 at his home in Orange at the age of 72, survived by his wife Lillian.
In 2007, Governor Jon Corzine signed a bill commemorating the achievements of Alexander, along with Hutchins F. Inge, the first African American to serve in the New Jersey Senate.

1960 Chatham Cup

The 1960 Chatham Cup was the 33rd annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included North Shore United, Hamilton Technical Old Boys, Kahukura (Bay of Plenty), Eastern Union (Gisborne), Moturoa, Napier Rovers, Wanganui Athletic, Kiwi United (Manawatu), Masterton Athletic, Northern Wellington, Nelson Athletic, Technical Old Boys (Christchurch), Northern (Dunedin), and Invercargill Thistle.
The 1960 final.
North Shore United won the cup for a second time, having previously been champions in 1952. The aggregate of eight goals in the final equalled the record set in the 1940 final, previously equalled in 1955 and 1958. The final was the perfect way for North Shore to celebrate their 75th anniversary. From a 1-1 half-time deadlock, NSU quickly raced to a 3-1 lead. Tech reduced the deficit before North Shore added two more goals. Technical completed the scoring with the sixth goal of the half, but were left two goals adrift of the winners. North Shore United's goals were scored by Tony Lowndes (2), John Ryan, Tom Paterson, and Ken Armstrong, while Ted Charlton, John Campbell, and Arthur Verham scored for Tech.

Surge arrester

A surge arrester is a product installed near the end of any conductor which is long enough before the conductor lands on its intended electrical component. The purpose is to divert damaging lightning-induced transients safely to ground through property changes to its varistor in parallel arrangement to the conductor inside the unit. Also called a surge protection device (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS), they are only designed to protect against electrical transients resulting from the lightning flash, not a direct lightning termination to the conductors. 
Lightning termination to earth results in ground currents which pass over buried conductors and induce a transient that propagates outward towards the ends of the conductor. The same induction happens in overhead and above ground conductors which experience the passing energy of an atmospheric EMP caused by the flash. These devices only protect against induced transients characteristic of a lightning discharge's rapid rise-time and will not protect against electrification caused by a direct termination to the conductor. Transients similar to lightning-induced, such as from a high voltage system's switch faulting, may be safely diverted to ground, however, continuous overcurrents are not protected by these devices. The energy in the transient is infinitesimally small in comparison to that of a lightning discharge; however it is still of sufficient quantity to cause arcing between different circuit pathways within today's microprocessors.
Without very thick insulation, which is generally cost prohibitive, most conductors running for any length whatsoever, say greater than about 50 feet, will experience lightning-induced transients some time. Because the transient is usually initiated at some point between the two ends of the conductor, most applications install a surge arrestor just before the conductor lands in each device to be protected. Each conductor must be protected, as each will have its own transient induced, and each SPD must provide a pathway to earth to safely divert the transient away from the protected component, be it instrument or computer, etc. The one notable exception where they are not installed at both ends is in high voltage distribution systems. In general, the induced voltage is not sufficient to do damage at the electric generation end of the lines; however, installation at the service entrance to a building is key to protecting downstream products that are not as robust.

__NOTOC__
Nan-Kan High School is a high school in Taoyuan County, Taiwan.
History.
The school was established in 1924, under the name of Nankan Enterprise Auxiliary School during Japan’s annexation. It is located in Wufu village, next to Wufu Temple, the 3rd grade historic site in Luchu Township. It originally was a two-year school, enrolled students graduating from Nankan、Kengzih and Luchu Elementary Schools. Eleven years later, it was reorganized into Hsinchu County Nankan Agricultural specialized school in 1935.
In 1945, Taiwan was retro ceded from Japan. Accordingly, the school had its name changed to be Hsinchu County Taoyuan Area Luchu Middle Agricultural Auxiliary School. In 1948, the school was renamed as“Luchu Township Nankan Middle Vocational Auxiliary School. In 1951, the school was reorganized into Taoyuan County Nankan Middle Vocational School.
The school was named Nankan Junior Middle School soon after junior high education started in 1959. The compulsory education program for primary and junior high school students was implemented in 1968, the school was thereby renamed Nankan Junior High School.
In 2000, the school founded a senior high department, enrolled six classes of grade 10 and expanded the campus to Nankan Elementary School. The school was reformed into a senior high school and its named was further renamed Taoyuan County Nankan Middle School. The following year, in 2001, the school was given orders to rename as Taoyuan County Nankan High School.
Today, there are 58 junior high classes and 33 senior high classes in this school and the number of the alumni and alumnae is more than twenty thousand. This is one of the oldest middle schools in Taoyuan County.

ŽIA valda

ŽIA valda is Lithuanian investment company pursuing projects of higher profit margin, usually, by establishing and consistently developing a new business unit, by consolidating companies of one business sector into one larger company or by acquiring a business which has growth potential but requires substantial reorganization. 
Businesses which achieve a certain degree of development concentrate their efforts into attracting public or institutional capital by selling a portion of their shares on IPO or private placement markets. The company manages and develops businesses operating in the sectors of aviation services, infrastructure, financial mediation, mass media, agriculture, services for businesses, catering and real estate.
The majority of company's income comes from management fees, dividends and revenue from part sales of businesses. To this day assets after loans owned by the company both directly and through its affiliates, related or associated companies are valued at nearly 120 million euros.
History.

Beginning of a private housing development project in Gulbinai settlement with a total are of more than 20 hectares (sold in 2006). Beginning of Kabantys sodai ("Hanging Gardens") project constructions on the edge of Vilnius centre.
2006: ranked second among a 1000 most rapidly developing Lithuanian businesses. Sale of controlling interest in Žvilgsnis iš arčiau (67% of shares were bought by an Icelandic capital company operating in over 25 countries Creditinfo Group Ltd). Reorganization of Lithuanian Airlines, privatized a year ago, into a group of 3 businesses: flyLAL - Lithuanian Airlines, flyLAL Group Services (today known as Avia Solutions Group) and VA reals; in total the group unites 9 companies. Design and construction of infrastructure purpose objects in Vilnius International Airport: 3 hangars for aircraft repairs, private passenger terminal and office buildings.
2007: acquisition of 100% interest in "Valstiečių laikraštis". Founding of UAB "Statinio interjeras"; field of operations – contracting, finish and general construction works.
2008: ŽIA valda launched a 48m LTL worth share issue; bought out by an Icelandic capital company SX investments and a Lithuanian capital company Amber capital partners. Due to the arrival of new shareholders, the company forms a Board; Board's work regulation approved. Subsidiary company Finhill, registered a year ago, is issued with Category B broker licence which allows the company provision of finance related services. Agrowill Group was listed on the Vilnius Stock Exchange, becoming the first successful initial public offering for ŽIA valda. Within 3 months share value increases by 30% whereas average OMX index slumped by almost 30%.
At the same year in its meeting in strategic committee the Lithuanian government endorses that AB flyLAL Group passenger terminal under construction in the place of the current premises owned by UAB VA reals is of strategic importance to Lithuania. The decision marks the beginning of the process to obtain construction permit. The terminal is expected to be completed by November 2009. 
Agrowill Group approves plans for active growth and intends to make around 10 acquisitions and increase the area of farming land and its revenue by several times. To achieve its targets ŽIA valda increases the number of its shares by 40% and issues additional shares.
