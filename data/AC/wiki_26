Paul Kelly and the Dots had formed in August 1978 in Melbourne from the remains of High Rise Bombers, which included Martin Armiger, the Dots underwent line-up changes prior to the album's release. Their debut single "Recognition" was issued in 1979, under the name The Dots, on an independent label, but had no chart success. "Recognition" line-up were Kelly (vocals), Chris Langman (guitars), Chris Worrall (guitars), Paul Gadsby (bass guitar) and John Lloyd (drums). More changes occurred, they signed to Mushroom Records and released "Billy Baxter" in 1980, which peaked at No. 38 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart.

Nevada World War II Army Airfields

During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) established numerous airfields in Nevada for training pilots and aircrews of USAAF fighters and bombers.

However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.
It is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports (such as Derby Field, near Lovelock), some were returned to agriculture or simply abandoned to decay and return to desert, and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.

Mooli Lahad

Professor Mooli Lahad (born 1953) is an Israeli psychologist and psychotrauma specialist, known for his creative methods of intervention and treatment of stress. He is the founder and director of the Institute of Dramatherapy, and Director of the CSPC - The International Stress Prevention Centre, at Tel Hai College in Kiryat Shmona, Israel. He is also Professor of Psychology at Tel Hai College and visiting Professor of Dramatherapy at Surrey University, England.
Lahad received his first PhD in psychology and a second in human and life science. 
Lahad champions the application of creative approaches such as dramatherapy and bibliotherapy in the prevention and treatment of psychotrauma.
He developed the Integrative Model of Coping and Resiliency 'BASIC PH' and the 'SEE FAR CBT' psychotrauma treatment protocol, adopted by other practitioners worldwide. This centres on people's natural coping mechanisms, of which he has identified six types. The method aims to help people suffering from anxiety disorders or traumatized individuals to reduce their symptoms either completely or to a manageable level to enable them to regain a sense of control of their lives.
Lahad has practised his methods in the immediate aftermath of disasters such as the 1999 earthquake in Turkey, the United States dealing with the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, in New York and New Jersey and in Sri Lanka following the 2004 tsunami. This has included both dealing with individual cases and providing 'cascade' training of professionals known as 'train the trainers' or 'helping the helpers' who then go on to train others, to quickly build a large force of counsellors a concept he calls 'building islands of resiliency'.
In 1979, he founded the Community Stress Prevention Center, in conjunction with the Israeli Ministry of Education.
Lahad is the former director of the Kiryat Shmona educational psychology services (1984–88), and former head of the Haifa University bibliotherapy course (1986–89). He is the author or co-author of 29 books and the recipient of three professional prizes: The Bonner Prize for outstanding contributions to Stress Prevention and the Education System in Israel from the Israeli Psychological Association, The Adler Institute for the welfare of the child Prize Tel Aviv University, and the Isareli Lottery Prize for Innovations in medicine for developing telepsychology services.

MTV Movie Awards Reloaded

MTV Movie Awards Reloaded or MTV: Reloaded, is a short parody film made in 2003 for the 2003 MTV Movie Awards. Half of the film is made by "Tenth Planet Productions", and the other half is archival footage from "The Matrix Reloaded", which was released in theaters at that time. The unedited version is on the DVD version of "The Matrix Reloaded".
Plot.
The movie starts with Justin (Justin Timberlake) and Seann (Seann William Scott) taking two girls into their apartment. As they are about to go in, the key doesn't fit. And suddenly the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim) shows up and realises they are the ones. He opens the door with the key around his neck. He opens the door and when Justin and Seann enter the door, they are transported to Zion, where (as in the film) a party is held at the temple. They learn from an extremely flamboyant dancer (Andy Dick) that Zion is the last human city and the robots are coming to kill them. They also learn that Morpheus is having a huge orgy at his place with machines. Justin refuses, but when Seann tries to stay he's pulled by his ear out. They come through a door and they see that Seann has a really kinky suit made of leather. Seann runs through a door marked 'Men' and Justin goes through another door into a park. He sees Neo talking to the Oracle (Wanda Sykes). After a discussion about N'Sync and the robot, Stiffler comes. He sticks his hand into and transforms her into a clone of him. And just then an army of Stiffler clones comes out and fights Justin as a parody of the "Burly Brawl" scene.
In place of the "Burly Brawl" music during the fight scene with the clones, this parody uses the song "Rock Your Body". He finally defeats Stiffler by punching him and turning him back into Seann. They get into an argument and are transported to the Architect's TV Room. The Architect (Will Ferrell) addresses about the connection between the Matrix and the MTV Movie awards and how he has no idea what he's talking about. He also talks about how Neo was supposed to host the Awards but since it was a full-time job and he was a bit distracted (with Trinity). He gets into an argument with Neo and yells at him. He shows them two doors, one door leads to the MTV Awards and the other leads to Trinity. Justin and Seann leave through one door and when Neo is about to leave through the other, the Architect jumps on him and they both smash through the door.

Reading Festival Bridge

The Reading Festival Bridge is an occasionally present footbridge over the River Thames at Reading in the English county of Berkshire. When present, the bridge links the site of the Reading Festival, on the south bank of the river, with camp sites and car parking on the north bank. The bridge is within the security perimeter of the festival, and is only available for use by festival goers.
The bridge structure is a temporary construction, erected on permanent footings, and was first erected to serve visitors to the Reading Festival in 2008 at an initial cost of £1 million. The intention is that the bridge will be dismantled and stored for most of the year, being re-erected for future festivals. It replaces a ferry service operated in previous years, which caused complaints over excessive queues.
The bridge crosses the river from the western end of the main festival site, some east of "Scours Lane" and within the Borough of Reading. The northern end of the bridge lies in the Oxfordshire civil parish of Mapledurham, on land leased from the Mapledurham Estate. Like the main festival site, the northern camp site and car park is used as farmland for most of the year.
The Bridge eases access to the town of Reading and events run by the annual Reading Fringe Festival.
In 2009, a wider bridge with improved aesthetics was constructed. The construction sequence of the 2009 bridge also resulted in less disruption to river traffic. Only a single two hour river closure order was required when installing the bridge, and similarly when removing it. All construction work was carried out at the bridge site, rather than upstream on the Mapledurham estate.

Pope John (numbering)

The numbering of Popes John does not occur in strict numerical order. These discrepancies are due in part to a now discounted belief in another Pope John between John XIV and John XV, and the antipapacy of John XVI.
John XX.
Confusion in numbering Popes John results from an error in the textual transmission of the entry on John XIV (983/984) in the "Liber Pontificalis". This entry originally specified not only the duration of his pontificate "("VIII mens."" = eight months), but also the duration of his ensuing imprisonment by Antipope Boniface VII, ""per IV menses"" ("for four months"). In the 11th century, some time after the pontificate of John XIX, this entry on John XIV was misread to be referring to two different popes John, the first reigning for eight months and directly succeeded by another John reigning for four months:
In distinguishing these two Johns, the second one came to be numbered as ""Iohannes XIV. bis"" ("John XIV the second") and it was confused with a historic character, the cardinal deacon John son of Robert, who opposed Boniface VII after John XIV's death. Given the fact that the following Popes John, from John XV (985–996) until John XIX (1024–1034), seemed to have neglected the existence of John XIV "bis", Petrus Hispanus "corrected" this error by taking the name John XXI rather than John XX.

Jirhangga (Manchu: ; Chinese: 吉爾杭阿) (? – June 1, 1856) belonged to Bordered Yellow Banner. He was an eminent Manchu official in the late Qing dynasty and served as the Governor of Jiangsu. He was appointed to that post by Imperial Inspector Minister Xiang Rong (向榮). Jirhangga was killed in action against the rebels during the Taiping Rebellion, and his death nearly amounted to a suicide, as he led a small army against huge Taiping forces.
For this action of considerable merit, he was promoted, shortly before the Tianjing Incident.
Against Small Swords Society.
Recovery of Shanghai county.
Before the 1856 Chinese New Year, Jirhangga and Mayor Nanjing led 15,000 troop, and broke into Shanghai after mining one of the city walls ; this was followed by street fighting, the recovery of Shanghai county, and finally, the arrest of thousands of Small Swords Society members.
Organizing the Corps at Mount Jiuhua.
In March 1856, he and Nanjing‘s Mayor led 40,000 troops stationed in Mount Jiuhua. The army was intended to capture the capital of the Taiping Rebellion in Nanjing.
Death.
Let me pay my debt to the Emperor !
When Taiping general Qin Rigang led a strong Taiping force to reinforce the offensive against Beijing in the North, Jirhangga had only few troops near enough to use against Qin Rigang. But Jirhangga did not try to escape his responsibility: he took the decision to immediately attack Qin Rigang, in spite of his staff's advice to retreat. To these advices of caution, he only replied : "In early days, I was but a middle rank officer in Beijing, and was soon promoted to a higher rank by the Emperor himself and Imperial Inspector Minister Xiang Rong. Now, it is my duty to thank them and defend Beijing!".
He then shouted : "Today I will pay my debt to the Emperor with my life !" Then, his eyes filled with tears, and the members of his staff remained silent.
In the District de Dantu city, after five days of fighting, Jirhangga was standing on top of the city wall, waving the Qing's banner adorned with the dragon, as he was cheering up his troops with undaunted courage.
Unfortunately, he was then killed by artillery shells. The mayor of Nanjing had just escaped to safety, but, for friendship's sake, he retraced his steps to come to Jirhangga. The mayor then took Jirhangga's body and tried to escape with the 7,000 survivors of the Green Standard Army. However, he was killed during an attack by the 30,000 strong Taiping rebel army.
3 persons friendship.
When the former vice mayor of Nanjing learnt that governor Jirhangga and the mayor were killed in action, he cried many days and said: "they were my good friends, such justice and upright persons were sacrificed for the country, I should followed them!". Soon, he committed suicide by jumping into the Yangtze River.
Extra merit.
Xiang Rong order general Zhang Guoliang led reinforcements from Jiangnan DaYing to save Jirhangga but arrived too late (Jirhangga had been killed a week earlier), but Zhang Guoliang defeated the Taiping and recovered the important city of Zhenjiang occupied for five years by the Taiping. Jirhangga's death and the five days combat changed the Taiping rebels's former offensive toward the north
Because Zhang Guoliang left Jiangnan Daying and recovered Zhenjiang, over 400,000 Taiping troops occurred second and more large offensive to Jiangnan DaYing, that was famous Battle of Nanking (1856) (??).
General Qin Rigang returned to Nanjing, after 3 months, occurred sad purge that Qin join in Nanjing, that merit was extra over Jirhangga's count in alive (??).

Minorities Minister of Israel

The Minister of Minorities is a member of the Israeli cabinet. The post was resurrected in 1999, as a ministerial responsibility under a Minister without portfolio, after having previously existed as an independent office in the provisional government between 1948 and 1949 (as the Minister of Minority Affairs). The post is currently held by Shalom Simhon. 
History.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs was founded after independence, and was the only new ministry not based on Yishuv institutions. The ministerial post was held by Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit, an Arabic speaker who was popular with the country's Arab population. Sheetrit attempted to promote integration and equality, but was hamstrung by the Military Government, which controlled most Arab areas after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as well as Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, who vetoed Sheetrit's proposal for an Arab advisory council in the ministry. 
Following disagreements with the Ministry of Religions and the Military government (which controlled most Arab areas after the war had ended), the Ministry of Minority Affairs was closed in 1949. Following its closure, Arab-related matters were handled by an advisor on Arab affairs in the Prime Minister's Office.
On 18 June 1996 Moshe Katsav, then deputy Prime Minister, was also appointed as "Minister for Israeli Arab Affairs". During the 27th government, Matan Vilnai served as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee for Arab-Israeli affairs. In the 29th government, Salah Tarif, a Druze, served as a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office with the responsibility on Minorities Affairs. In the current government Avishay Braverman, a Minister without Portfolio, was also responsible for Minorities Affairs until 17 January 2011 when he resigned. A day later Matan Vilnai was announced as the new minister, but was replaced on 19 January by Shalom Simhon after complaints that minorities did not want to be under the Defense Ministry.

Levan polysaccharide

Levans are a group of fructans; polymers of fructose forming a non-structural carbohydrate, which in the case of levans can themselves link together to form super-molecules comprising even hundreds of thousands. 
The shortest levan is 6-kestose, essentially a chain of three fructose molecules with a few extra atoms in one segment. Levans are produced in almost all bacterial versions of fructan production, as well as being possible to produce by fracturing soybean mucilage.

Assault Championship Wrestling

Assault Championship Wrestling was an American independent wrestling promotion based in Connecticut and promoted by Jason Knight, a retired wrestler and manager, during the early 2000s. The first major independent promotion to operate in Connecticut, Assault Championship Wrestling became important on the independent circuit particularly after the close of Extreme Championship Wrestling in 2002 and featured many former ECW veterans including Danny Doring, Kid Kash, Justin Credible, Little Guido, Tony DeVito, Balls Mahoney, John Kronus, Francine and Joel Gertner who acted as its commissioner.
New England Championship Wrestling, a rival promotion, often held inter-promotional events as well as allowing its champions to defend their titles at ACW cards. They also had a working arraignment with Knight's wrestling dojo. A number of independent wrestlers also made frequent appearances including Matt Stryker, Julio Dinero, Wagner Brown, Matthew Kaye, Homicide, Jeff Rocker, Scotty Charisma and The Backseat Boyz (Trent Acid and Johnny Kashmere). Popular female wrestlers included Mercedes Martinez, Becky Bayless, April Hunter, Nikki Roxx, Talia Madison, Ana Rocha and Angel Orsini.
History.
Originally established under Acid Pro Wrestling, the promotion began operating in central Connecticut in early 2000 and held its first supercard, "The Best Things In Life Are Free!", in Waterbury, Connecticut on May 26, 2000. It also held its first televised event in Waterbury featuring Angel Orsini, Joel Gertner and Jason Knight on November 12, 2000.
The promotion would continue holding shows in Plainville, Southington, Naugatuck and Meriden, Connecticut during 2001 with appearances by Homicide, the F.B.I., Francine, Christian York, Chris Hamrick, Julio Dinero, New Jack, Chris Candido and Tammy Lynn Sytch. On April 8, 2001, an Evening Gown match between Foxxy Dreams and Missy Hyatt took place at an ACW show in East Hartford. Hyatt was originally scheduled to face another female wrestler, however Dreams took her place when Hyatt's opponent did not arrive. Although Foxxy Dreams technically defeated Hyatt after tearing off her gown, the match official Joel Gertner stopped the match and awarded the win to Hyatt deciding to change the stipulations for the winner to be the first to lose her dress.
Knight had originally been the booker for the promotion, however he left to start a rival promotion after a falling out with the owners. After Knight took over the promotion in August 2001, the promotion was renamed Assault Championship Wrestling and followed up on the success of the previous supercard with "Second Wave" and "Hell to Pay" later that year.
In 2002, the promotion expanded holding events in New Britain and North Haven, Connecticut. The promotion also began "Jason Knight's Pro Wrestling Dojo and Gym" in nearby Wolcott, Connecticut. On August 9, 2002, Knight and several ACW wrestlers were at New England Championship Wrestling's second annual "Birthday Bash" at the Goodtimes Emporium in Somerville, Massachusetts. Knight, who was a guest commentator for iMassRadio.com, was the first ever guest celebrity to attend the event along with Traci Brooks. Students from the House of Pain Pro Wrestling school were also at the event.
The following year, its main "heel" stable "La Familia" appeared on several shows with Connecticut Championship Wrestling. Although speculated that their arrival might lead to an "invasion" storyline, ACW abruptly stopped future appearances for undisclosed reasons.
In early-May, an unexpected cancellation of an outdoor show as well as its website going offline prompted internet rumors that the promotion was shutting down. This was denied by officials, specifically wrestler and part-time road agent Bulldog Blanski, who explained the show had been originally canceled due to rain and that the venue had decided to cancel its next show the following week on Mother's Day. He further explained that the website had been changing servers and announced the promotion would continue holding shows with the next event being held at Riders Cafe in Waterbury on June 6, 2003.
However, the company began suffering financial trouble during its last year and held its last event in New Britain on March 21, 2004. The card featured Chi Chi Cruz, Dances with Dudley, Tony DeVito, Scotty Charisma, Mercedes Martinez and Justin Credible in the main event.
Knight's wrestling school remained open however and, in late 2004, several former ACW mainstays including Bulldog Blanski and Mike E. Milano decided to start another promotion, Defiant Pro Wrestling. The promotion was initially successful, however it became inactive for two months the next year. Jason Knight, who appeared at its last show to begin a so-called "invasion", returned at its next show "Burning Bridges" in Southington, Connecticut on November 19, 2005. Knight would remain the top heel in the promotion as he feuded with Milano during his time with the promotion.
In August 2008 ACW returned to its home in Waterbury, CT and started training a few wrestlers. They managed to only have 2 shows with very little attendance. They went bankrupt for a second time in December 2008, also losing the building/gym.

<doc id="18914017" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18914017" title="Alzheimer's disease">
Alzheimer's disease

Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known in medical literature as Alzheimer disease, is the most common form of dementia. There is no cure for the disease, which worsens as it progresses, and eventually leads to death. It was first described by German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer in 1906 and was named after him. Most often, AD is diagnosed in people over 65 years of age, although the less-prevalent early-onset Alzheimer's can occur much earlier. In 2006, there were people worldwide with AD. Alzheimer's is predicted to affect 1 in 85 people globally by 2050.
Although Alzheimer's disease develops differently for every individual, there are many common symptoms. Early symptoms are often mistakenly thought to be 'age-related' concerns, or manifestations of stress. In the early stages, the most common symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events, known as short term memory loss. When AD is suspected, the diagnosis is usually confirmed with tests that evaluate behaviour and thinking abilities, often followed by a brain scan if available, however, examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. As the disease advances, symptoms can include confusion, irritability, aggression, mood swings, trouble with language, and long-term memory loss. As the person declines they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Since the disease is different for each individual, predicting how it will affect the person is difficult. AD develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before becoming fully apparent, and it can progress undiagnosed for years. On average, the life expectancy following diagnosis is approximately seven years. Fewer than three percent of individuals live more than fourteen years after diagnosis.
The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood. Research indicates that the disease is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. Current treatments only help with the symptoms of the disease. There are no available treatments that stop or reverse the progression of the disease. , more than 1,000 clinical trials have been or are being conducted to test various compounds in AD. Mental stimulation, exercise, and a balanced diet have been suggested as ways to delay cognitive symptoms (though not brain pathology) in healthy older individuals, but there is no conclusive evidence supporting an effect. It is classified as a neurodegenerative disorder.
Because AD cannot be cured and is degenerative, the person increasingly relies on others for assistance. The role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers; the pressures can be wide-ranging, involving social, psychological, physical, and economic elements of the caregiver's life. In developed countries, AD is one of the most costly diseases to society.
Characteristics.
The disease course is divided into four stages, with progressive patterns of cognitive and functional impairments.
Pre-dementia.
The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex daily living activities. The most noticeable deficit is memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.
Subtle problems with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, flexibility, and abstract thinking, or impairments in semantic memory (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of AD. Apathy can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease. Depressive symptoms, irritability and reduced awareness of subtle memory difficulties also occur commonly.
The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed mild cognitive impairment, but whether this term corresponds to a different diagnostic stage or identifies the first step of AD is a matter of dispute.
Early.
In people with AD the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small portion of them, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.
Language problems are mainly characterised by a shrinking vocabulary and decreased word fluency, which lead to a general impoverishment of oral and written language. In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately. While performing fine motor tasks such as writing, drawing or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties (apraxia) may be present but they are commonly unnoticed. As the disease progresses, people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.
Moderate.
Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.
Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, irritability and labile affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% of people with AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). Urinary incontinence can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and caretakers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.
Advanced.
During the final stage of AD, the person is completely dependent upon caregivers. Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common results.
People with AD will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks without assistance. Muscle mass and mobility deteriorate to the point where they are bedridden, and they lose the ability to feed themselves. AD is a terminal illness, with the cause of death typically being an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.
Cause.
The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still mostly unknown except for 1% to 5% of cases where genetic differences have been identified. Several competing hypotheses exist trying to explain the cause of the disease:
Genetics.
Around 0.1% of the cases are familial forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which usually have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—e.g., Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels. This suggests that presenilin mutations can cause disease even if they lower the total amount of Aβ produced and may point to other roles of presenilin or a role for alterations in the function of APP and/or its fragments other than Aβ. There exist variants of the APP gene which are protective.
Most cases of Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant inheritance and are termed sporadic AD, in which environmental and genetic differences may act as risk factors. The best known genetic risk factor is the inheritance of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE). Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one APOEε4 allele. The APOEε4 allele increases the risk of the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. Like many human diseases, environmental effects and genetic modifiers result in incomplete penetrance. For example, certain Nigerian populations do not show the relationship between dose of APOEε4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease seen in other human populations. While early attempts to screen up to 400 candidate genes for association with late-onset sporadic AD (LOAD) resulted in a low yield, more recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) turned up 13 genes (and gene clusters): CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, MS4A, ABCA7, EPHA1, CD33, CD2AP, ATP5H, EXOC4, CTNNA3, RNF219.
Mutations in the TREM2 gene have been associated with a 3 to 5 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. A suggested mechanism of action is that when TREM2 is mutated, white blood cells in the brain are no longer able to control the amount of beta amyloid present.
Cholinergic hypothesis.
The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the "cholinergic hypothesis", which proposes that AD is caused by reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, leading to generalised neuroinflammation.
Amyloid hypothesis.
In 1991, the "amyloid hypothesis" postulated that extracellular beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental cause of the disease. Support for this postulate comes from the location of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit AD by 40 years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. Whilst apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.
An experimental vaccine was found to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, but it did not have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.
In 2009, this theory was updated, suggesting that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP by one of the same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21). DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so it is possible that the N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the ageing brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.
Tau hypothesis.
The "tau hypothesis" is the idea that tau protein abnormalities initiate the disease cascade. In this model, hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other threads of tau. Eventually, they form neurofibrillary tangles inside nerve cell bodies. When this occurs, the microtubules disintegrate, collapsing the neuron's transport system. This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication between neurons and later in the death of the cells.
Other hypotheses.
Herpes simplex virus type 1 has been proposed to play a causative role in people carrying the susceptible versions of the apoE gene.
Some have hypothesized that dietary copper may play a causal role.
Another hypothesis asserts that the disease may be caused by age-related myelin breakdown in the brain. Iron released during myelin breakdown is hypothesised to cause further damage. Homeostatic myelin repair processes contribute to the development of proteinaceous deposits such as beta-amyloid and tau.
Oxidative stress and dys-homeostasis of biometal (biology) metabolism may be significant in the formation of the pathology.
AD individuals show 70% loss of locus coeruleus cells that provide norepinephrine (in addition to its neurotransmitter role) that locally diffuses from "varicosities" as an endogenous anti-inflammatory agent in the microenvironment around the neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels in the neocortex and hippocampus. It has been shown that norepinephrine stimulates mouse microglia to suppress Aβ-induced production of cytokines and their phagocytosis of Aβ. This suggests that degeneration of the locus ceruleus might be responsible for increased Aβ deposition in AD brains.
There is tentative evidence that exposure to air pollution may be a contributing factor to the development of Alzheimer's disease.
Pathophysiology.
Neuropathology.
Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.
Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are clearly visible by microscopy in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau which has become hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles as a consequence of ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.
Biochemistry.
Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded beta amyloid and tau amyloid proteins in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43 amino acids in length, called beta-amyloid (Aβ). Beta-amyloid is a fragment from a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, an unknown process causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments by enzymes through proteolysis. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of beta-amyloid, which form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.
AD is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly made up of structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the axon and back. A protein called "tau" stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.
Disease mechanism.
Exactly how disturbances of production and aggregation of the beta-amyloid peptide gives rise to the pathology of AD is not known.
The amyloid hypothesis traditionally points to the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils, which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). It is also known that Aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neurons.
Various inflammatory processes and cytokines may also have a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response.
Alterations in the distribution of different neurotrophic factors and in the expression of their receptors such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been described in AD.
Diagnosis.
Alzheimer's disease is usually diagnosed based on the person's history, history from relatives, and observations of the person's behaviors. The presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features and the absence of alternative conditions is supportive. Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease.
Assessment of intellectual functioning including memory testing can further characterise the state of the disease. Medical organisations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardise the diagnostic process for practicing physicians. The diagnosis can be confirmed with very high accuracy post-mortem when brain material is available and can be examined histologically.
Criteria.
The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, now known as the Alzheimer's Association) established the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.
Techniques.
Neuropsychological tests such as the mini–mental state examination (MMSE) are widely used to evaluate the cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. Neurological examination in early AD will usually provide normal results, except for obvious cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from other diseases processes, including other causes of dementia.
Further neurological examinations are crucial in the differential diagnosis of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised in the assessment of the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, as well as on the decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.
Another recent objective marker of the disease is the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for beta-amyloid or tau proteins, both total tau protein and phosphorylated tau181P protein concentrations. Searching for these proteins using a spinal tap can predict the onset of Alzheimer's with a sensitivity of between 94% and 100%. When used in conjunction with existing neuroimaging techniques, doctors can identify people with significant memory loss who are already developing the disease. Spinal fluid tests are commercially available, unlike the latest neuroimaging technology. Alzheimer's was diagnosed in one-third of the people who did not have any symptoms in a 2010 study, meaning that disease progression occurs well before symptoms occur.
Supplemental testing provides extra information on some features of the disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses. Blood tests can identify other causes for dementia than AD—causes which may, in rare cases, be reversible. It is common to perform thyroid function tests, assess B12, rule out syphilis, rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anaemia. (See differential diagnosis for Dementia). (It is also necessary to rule out delirium).
Psychological tests for depression are employed, since depression can either be concurrent with AD (see Depression of Alzheimer disease), an early sign of cognitive impairment, or even the cause.
Prevention.
At present, there is no definitive evidence to support that any particular measure is effective in preventing AD. Global studies of measures to prevent or delay the onset of AD have often produced inconsistent results.
Epidemiological studies have proposed relationships between certain modifiable factors, such as diet, cardiovascular risk, pharmaceutical products, or intellectual activities among others, and a population's likelihood of developing AD. Only further research, including clinical trials, will reveal whether these factors can help to prevent AD.
Medication.
Although cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, are associated with a higher risk of onset and course of AD, statins, which are cholesterol lowering drugs, have not been effective in preventing or improving the course of the disease.
Long-term usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a reduced likelihood of developing AD. Human postmortem studies, in animal models, or in vitro investigations also support the notion that NSAIDs can reduce inflammation related to amyloid plaques. However trials investigating their use as palliative treatment have failed to show positive results while no prevention trial has been completed. Hormone replacement therapy, although previously used, may increase the risk of dementia.
Lifestyle.
People who engage in intellectual activities such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. This is compatible with the cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations. Education delays the onset of AD syndrome, but is not related to earlier death after diagnosis. Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease.
Physical activity is also associated with a reduced risk of AD.
Diet.
People who eat a mediterranean diet have a lower risk of AD, and it may improve outcomes in those with the disease. Those who eat a diet high in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates have a higher risk. The mediterranean diet's beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as the mechanism of action. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.
Reviews on the use of vitamins and minerals have not found enough consistent evidence to recommend them. This includes vitamin A, C, E, selenium, zinc, and folic acid with or without vitamin B12. Additionally vitamin E is associated with health risks. Trials examining folic acid (B9) and other B vitamins failed to show any significant association with cognitive decline. Docosahexaenoic acid, an Omega 3 fatty acid, has not been found to slow decline.
Curcumin as of 2010 has not shown benefit in people even though there is tentative evidence in animals. There is inconsistent and unconvincing evidence that ginkgo has any positive effect on cognitive impairment and dementia, and a recent study concludes that it has no effect in reducing the rate of AD incidence. As of 2008 there is no concrete evidence that cannabinoids are effective in improving the symptoms of AD or dementia. Some research in its early stages however looks promising.
Others.
Some studies have shown an increased risk of developing AD with environmental factors such the intake of metals, particularly aluminium. The quality of some of these studies has been criticised, and other studies have concluded that there is no relationship between these environmental factors and the development of AD.
While some studies suggest that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease, reviewers found that further epidemiological and laboratory investigations of this hypothesis are needed. Smoking is a significant AD risk factor.
Systemic markers of the innate immune system are risk factors for late-onset AD.
Management.
There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefit but remain palliative in nature. Current treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.
Pharmaceutical.
Five medications are currently used to treat the cognitive problems of AD: four are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil) and the other (memantine) is an NMDA receptor antagonist. The benefit from their use is small. No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the progression of the disease.
Reduction in the activity of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users and are mild to moderate in severity. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.
Glutamate is a useful excitatory neurotransmitter of the nervous system, although excessive amounts in the brain can lead to cell death through a process called excitotoxicity which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate receptors. Excitotoxicity occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Memantine (brand names "Akatinol") is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist first used as an anti-influenza agent. It acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate. Memantine has been shown to be moderately efficacious in the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Its effects in the initial stages of AD are unknown. Reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild, including hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. The combination of memantine and donepezil has been shown to be "of statistically significant but clinically marginal effectiveness".
Antipsychotic drugs are modestly useful in reducing aggression and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease with behavioural problems, but are associated with serious adverse effects, such as cerebrovascular events, movement difficulties or cognitive decline, that do not permit their routine use. When used in the long-term, they have been shown to associate with increased mortality.
Huperzine A while promising, requires further evidence before it use can be recommended.
Psychosocial intervention.
Psychosocial interventions are used as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment and can be classified within behaviour-, emotion-, cognition- or stimulation-oriented approaches. Research on efficacy is unavailable and rarely specific to AD, focusing instead on dementia in general.
Behavioural interventions attempt to identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning, but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as incontinence. There is a lack of high quality data on the effectiveness of these techniques in other behaviour problems such as wandering.
Emotion-oriented interventions include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, also called snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.
Finally, validation therapy is based on acceptance of the reality and personal truth of another's experience, while sensory integration is based on exercises aimed to stimulate senses. There is no evidence to support the usefulness of these therapies.
The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and cognitive retraining, is the reduction of cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person in order to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.
Stimulation-oriented treatments include art, music and pet therapies, exercise, and any other kind of recreational activities. Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function. Nevertheless, as important as these effects are, the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the change in the person's routine.
Caregiving.
Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, caregiving essentially is the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease.
During the early and moderate stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden. Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue the person with the disease or the use of modified daily life objects. Patients may also become incapable of feeding themselves, so they require food in smaller pieces or pureed. When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members. The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers.
As the disease progresses, different medical issues can appear, such as oral and dental disease, pressure ulcers, malnutrition, hygiene problems, or respiratory, skin, or eye infections. Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed when they do arise. During the final stages of the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death.
A small recent study in the US concluded that people whose caregivers had a realistic understanding of the prognosis and clinical complications of late dementia were less likely to receive aggressive treatment near the end of life.
Feeding tubes.
There is strong evidence that feeding tubes do not help people with advanced Alzheimer's dementia gain weight, regain strength or function, prevent aspiration pneumonias, or improve quality of life.
Prognosis.
[[File:Alzheimer and other dementias world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|Disability-adjusted life year for Alzheimer and other dementias per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.
The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.
Life expectancy of the population with the disease is reduced. The mean life expectancy following diagnosis is approximately seven years. Fewer than 3% of people live more than fourteen years. Disease features significantly associated with reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as heart problems, diabetes or history of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened survival. While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced when compared to the healthy population among those who are younger. Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women.
The disease is the underlying cause of death in 70% of all cases. Pneumonia and dehydration are the most frequent immediate causes of death, while cancer is a less frequent cause of death than in the general population.
Epidemiology.
Two main measures are used in epidemiological studies: incidence and prevalence. Incidence is the number of new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while prevalence is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.
Regarding incidence, cohort longitudinal studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, which means that half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every five years after the age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer’s disease is twenty-six percent higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a thirty percent lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.
Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in 2000 both overall and in the 65–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 19% in the 75–84 group and to 42% in the greater than 84 group. Prevalence rates in less developed regions are lower. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2005, 0.379% of people worldwide had dementia, and that the prevalence would increase to 0.441% in 2015 and to 0.556% in 2030. Other studies have reached similar conclusions. Another study estimated that in 2006, 0.40% of the world population (range 0.17–0.89%; absolute number , range ) were afflicted by AD, and that the prevalence rate would triple and the absolute number would quadruple by 2050.
History.
The ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and physicians associated old age with increasing dementia. It was not until 1901 that German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer identified the first case of what became known as Alzheimer's disease in a fifty-year-old woman he called Auguste D. He followed her case until she died in 1906, when he first reported publicly on it. During the next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature, some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease. The disease was first described as a distinctive disease by Emil Kraepelin after suppressing some of the clinical (delusions and hallucinations) and pathological features (arteriosclerotic changes) contained in the original report of Auguste D. He included "Alzheimer's disease", also named "presenile" dementia by Kraepelin, as a subtype of "senile dementia" in the eighth edition of his "Textbook of Psychiatry", published on 1910.
For most of the 20th century, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes. This eventually led to the diagnosis of "Alzheimer's disease" independently of age. The term "senile dementia of the Alzheimer type" (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used for those younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.
Society and culture.
Social costs.
Dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, may be among the most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their cost in other countries such as Argentina, or South Korea, is also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160 billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100 billion each year.
The greatest origin of costs for society is the long-term care by health care professionals and particularly institutionalisation, which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society. The cost of living at home is also very high, especially when informal costs for the family, such as caregiving time and caregiver's lost earnings, are taken into account.
Costs increase with dementia severity and the presence of behavioural disturbances, and are related to the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care. Therefore any treatment that slows cognitive decline, delays institutionalisation or reduces caregivers' hours will have economic benefits. Economic evaluations of current treatments have shown positive results.
Caregiving burden.
The role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects. Home care is usually preferred by people with AD and their families. This option also delays or eliminates the need for more professional and costly levels of care. Nevertheless two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias.
Dementia caregivers are subject to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 per year in the United States, depending on the study.
Cognitive behavioural therapy and the teaching of coping strategies either individually or in group have demonstrated their efficacy in improving caregivers' psychological health.
Notable cases.
As Alzheimer's disease is highly prevalent, many notable people have developed it. Well-known examples are former United States President Ronald Reagan and Irish writer Iris Murdoch, both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities deteriorated with the disease. Other cases include the retired footballer Ferenc Puskás, the former Prime Ministers Harold Wilson (United Kingdom) and Adolfo Suárez (Spain), the actress Rita Hayworth, the actor Charlton Heston, the novelist Terry Pratchett, Indian politician George Fernandes,
and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics recipient Charles K. Kao.
AD has also been portrayed in films such as: "Iris" (2001), based on John Bayley's memoir of his wife Iris Murdoch;
"The Notebook" (2004), based on Nicholas Sparks' 1996 novel of the same name; "A Moment to Remember" (2004);"Thanmathra" (2005); "Memories of Tomorrow (Ashita no Kioku)" (2006), based on Hiroshi Ogiwara's novel of the same name; "Away from Her" (2006), based on Alice Munro's short story "The Bear Came over the Mountain". Documentaries on Alzheimer's disease include "Malcolm and Barbara: A Love Story" (1999) and "Malcolm and Barbara: Love's Farewell" (2007), both featuring Malcolm Pointon.
Research directions.
, the safety and efficacy of more than 400 pharmaceutical treatments had been or were being investigated in 1012 clinical trials worldwide, and approximately a quarter of these compounds are in Phase III trials, the last step prior to review by regulatory agencies.
One area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy would be used to treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.
In 2008, two separate clinical trials showed positive results in modifying the course of disease in mild to moderate AD with methylthioninium chloride (trade name "rember"), a drug that inhibits tau aggregation, and dimebon, an antihistamine.
The consecutive phase-III trial of dimebon failed to show positive effects in the primary and secondary endpoints.
The common herpes simplex virus HSV-1 has been found to colocate with amyloid plaques. This suggested the possibility that AD could be treated or prevented with antiviral medication.
Preliminary research on the effects of meditation on retrieving memory and cognitive functions have been encouraging. Limitations of this research can be addressed in future studies with more detailed analyses.
An FDA panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of florbetapir, which is currently used in an investigational study. The imaging agent can help to detect Alzheimer's brain plaques, but will require additional clinical research before it can be made available commercially.
Manned spaceflight may harm the brain of astronauts and accelerate the onset of "Alzheimer's disease".
Imaging.
In a person already having dementia, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) appears to be superior in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other possible causes, compared with the usual attempts employing mental testing and medical history analysis. Advances have led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria.
PiB PET remains investgational, however a similar PET scanning radiopharmaceutical called florbetapir, containing the longer-lasting radionuclide fluorine-18, has recently been tested as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease, and given FDA approval for this use.
Amyloid imaging is likely to be used in conjunction with other markers rather than as an alternative. Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.

European integrated hydrogen project

The European integrated Hydrogen Project (EIHP) was a European Union project to integrate United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE or ECE) guidelines and create a basis of ECE regulation of hydrogen vehicles and the necessary infrastructure replacing national legislation and regulations. The aim of this project was enhancing of the safety of hydrogen vehicles and harmonizing their licensing and approval process.
History.
EIHP was launched in 1998. It was coordinated by Ludwig-Bölkow-Systemtechnik GmbH, a German consultancy company. Its phase 1 lasted from 1998–2000. It consists of 10 partners including research institutes, energy companies and automotive industries such as BMW, Renault, and Volvo. During the phase 1, information about the existing legislation and safety of alternative propulsion vehicles and related infrastructure was collected. As a result of the phase 1, UNECE drafted regulations for the onboard storage system for liquid hydrogen, and for the on-board storage system for gaseous hydrogen.
Phase 2 lasted from 2001–2004 and it developed drafts of a harmonized regulation for hydrogen-fuelled road vehicles, procedures for periodic hydrogen vehicle inspections, and standards and periodic inspection procedures for the relevant refuelling infrastructure, subsystems and components. During phase 2, a new liquefied hydrogen (LH2) storage system (cryogenic tank) was designed and manufactured. It was approved safe by TÜV SÜD, the German Technical Inspection Association. Phase 2 also developed a semi-quantitative risk analysis methodology (Rapid Risk Ranking), which is used for risk assessment of several hydrogen applications. There were 20 partners of phase 2.
Although regulations worked-out by EIHP are not officially adopted, they are used as guidelines for design and approval of on-board cryogenic storage systems. For example, General Motors and BMW have announced that they are following EIHP's draft regulations when jointly developing refueling devices for liquid hydrogen vehicles.

He played domestic cricket for KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa until 2008, when he then moved to the Highveld Lions, then moving back to the Dolphins in 2011, and the hard-hitting all-rounder is seen by some as a natural successor to South African legend Lance Klusener.
Regarded as a late developer, he was not selected by Natal Schools at age group level, but his performances in South African club cricket drew the attention of KwaZulu-Natal's academy. Frylink made his List A debut for KwaZulu-Natal on 10 October 2004 in a UCB Provincial Shield match against Easterns.
Frylinck made his first-class debut on 13 October 2005 in the South African Airways Provincial Three-Day Challenge match against Western Province, taking impressive figures of 6–94 in 20 overs. In the same season he made his debut in the SuperSport Series for the Nashua Dolphins (which is the name used by KwaZulu-Natal in that competition).
Frylinck was a member of the South African National Academy Squad in 2006.
After appearing for Kwazulu-Natal/Dolphins in 16 first-class matches, Frylinck was not included among their contracted players for the 2008/2009 season.
Frylinck has extensive experience of league cricket in England. In 2007 he played in one match for Nelson Cricket Club in the Lancashire League and in 16 matches for Vauxhall Mallards in the East Anglian Premier Cricket League. In 2008 he played in 20 matches for Benwell Hill Cricket Club in the Northern Rock ECB North East Premier League.
On 10 June 2008 he made his debut for Surrey's second team in the Second Eleven Championship match away to Worcestershire, achieving bowling figures of 5–130 in the match, which Surrey won by 8 wickets. Subsequently, Frylinck made three appearances in the Second Eleven Trophy, a one-day competition. In these three matches, he took 7 wickets for 92 runs.
Having impressed Surrey's head coach, Alan Butcher, with his performances for the second team and his ability to bowl yorkers, slower balls and bouncers, Frylinck made his first team debut for Surrey on 17 August 2008 against Northants Steelbacks in the Pro40 league, taking 3–52.
Frylinck did not appear again for the Surrey first team in the 2008 season, but he made one further appearance in the Second Eleven Championship against Lancashire.

Cleonymus of Sparta

Cleonymus was a member of the Spartan royal family of the Agiads. He was the second son of Cleomenes II and a pretender to the Spartan throne. He did not succeed his father (died 309/308 BCE), allegedly because he was violent and tyrannic. His nephew Areus I became new king instead. Hence, he nursed a grudge against his fellow Spartans.
To help Taranto against the Lucani, Cleonymus went as mercenary leader to southern Italy with the backing of the Spartan administration (303 BCE). There are two different accounts of his Italian expedition; one were written by Diodorus Siculus and one by Livy. But the relations between the two sources are unclarified. The historian Thomas Lenschau supposes that they describe two different campaigns of Cleonymus: that one described by Diodorus Siculus would have taken place in 303 BCE and that one described by Livy in 302 BCE.
According to Diodorus Siculus Cleonymus raised such a large army that the Lucani immediately concluded peace. Then the Spartan prince took the city of Metaponto and sailed to Corcyra which island he also quickly captured. Learning that Taranto and other cities had broken with him he sailed back and was at first successful, but then he was defeated at a night attack. Since a lot of his ships were destroyed by a storm at the same time he had to withdraw to Corcyra (303/302 BCE).
Probably in the next year (302 BCE) Cleonymus returned to Italy and – according to Livy – first conquered a city called Thuriae, which is not exactly localized. But Roman armies forced him to go back to his ships. He then sailed to the north across the Adriatic Sea and landed at the coast of the Veneti. From the mouth of the Meduacus (now Brenta River) he sailed upstream to the country of Patavium (now Padua) and raided the nearby villages. But the natives defeated him and he suffered great losses – allegedly four-fifths of his ships were destroyed. Cleonymus had to leave the territory of Patavium. It is unknown how his campaign ended.
Cleonymus is next mentioned in 293 BCE. By then he seems to have returned to Sparta and was now sent to Boeotia to help the inhabitants against Demetrius I Poliorcetes. But when this diadoch arrived with an army Cleonymus withdrew.
As an older man Cleonymus married the beautiful Chilonis as his second wife. Chilonis was the daughter of Leotychidas, who was a member of the other Spartan royal family of the Eurypontids. However, Chilonis loved Acrotatus II, the grand-nephew of Cleonymus. Deeply offended, Cleonymus left Sparta and, in 272 BCE, persuaded Pyrrhus to back his claim to the Spartan throne. Pyrrhus besieged Sparta, confident that he could take the city with ease, however, the Spartans, with even the women taking part in the defense, succeeded in beating off Pyrrhus' attacks. At this point Pyrrhus received an appeal for help from his supporters in Argos which was being attacked by Antigonus Gonatas and he called off the attack. Cleonymus does not appear in the sources after this event any more so that his further lot is unknown.

St. Kilian's Abbey, Würzburg

The Abbey of the Holy Redeemer (S. Salvatoris), also called St. Kilian's Abbey, was a Benedictine monastery in Würzburg, Germany. It was founded by Burchard, the first Bishop of Würzburg, about 745.
The monks had charge of Würzburg Cathedral (Salvatormünster) and the cathedral school. The latter gained considerable renown. Probably owing to laxity in observance of the rule, Bernwelf, Bishop of Würzburg, replaced the monks in 786 by canons who led a common life and were popularly styled Brothers of St. Kilian. The expelled monks, more than fifty in number, found a home at the Abbey of Neustadt on the Main, where Bishop Megingaud, who had resigned the See of Würzburg, was abbot.

German submarine U-137 (1940)

German submarine "U-137" was a Type IID U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" in World War II. Her keel was laid down on 16 November 1939 by Deutsche Werke in Kiel. She was launched on 18 May 1940 and commissioned on 15 June 1940 with "Oberleutnant zur See" Herbert Wohlfarth in command.
"U-137" conducted four patrols, sinking six ships totalling and damaged one vessel of 4,917 GRT. She also damaged one auxiliary warship of 10,552 GRT. She was scuttled shortly before Germany's surrender on 2 May 1945 at Wilhelmshaven. "U-137" never suffered any casualties to her crew.
Operational career.
1st patrol.
"U-137" made the short journey from Kiel to Stavanger in Norway in September 1940. It was from the Nordic port that she began her first patrol on the 21st. Her route took her through the 'gap' between the Faroe and Shetland Islands and on in to the Atlantic west of Scotland and Ireland.
She sank the "Manchester Brigade" west of Malin Head on the 26th and damaged the "Ashantian" on the same date. The ship had been abandoned by her crew; the master and eight crew-members had returned to the vessel where the master was scandalized to see that the ship had been looted following the presence of a boarding party from the armed trawler HMS "Wolves". "Ashantian" was repaired and returned to service in September 1941. She was sunk in April 1943.
Continuing her success, the U-boat sank the "Stratford", in the same general area as her other victims, also on the 26th.
"U-137" arrived at Lorient on the French Atlantic coast, on 29 September.
2nd patrol.
The Armed Merchant Cruiser HMS "Cheshire" was torpedoed northwest of Ireland on 14 October 1940. The ship was towed to Belfast Lough and then moved to Liverpool for repairs that took six months.
Having set off from Lorient on 9 October, the boat returned there on the 17th.
3rd patrol.
Sortie number three commenced with "U-137"s departure from Lorient on 3 November 1940 and returning to her old hunting grounds west of Scotland and north of Ireland. Her run of victories continued, sinking the "Cape St. Andrew" west northwest of Aran Island on the 13th; the "Planter" on the 16th north northwest of Bloody Foreland and two ships on the same day, from the same convoy (HG-46), the "Veronica" and the "Saint Germain" north northwest of Tory Island on 17 November.
The submarine steamed to Norway, again round the British Isles, docking in Bergen, on 22 November.
4th patrol.
The boat's last operational patrol was to the north of the Shetland Islands, but she did not attack any targets. She then moved from Bergen to Helsingör in Denmark and on to Kiel, arriving there on 29 August 1941.
Fate.
"U-137" became a 'school' (or training) boat in December 1940, a position she would hold for the rest of the war. She was one of many that were scuttled in the "Raederschleuse" (a lock named after the Grand Admiral), in Wilhelmshaven, on 2 May 1945. The wreck was broken up, although the post-war date is unknown.

World Hepatitis Day

World Hepatitis Day, observed on July 28 every year, aims to raise global awareness of hepatitis B and hepatitis C and encourage prevention, diagnosis and treatment. One of only four disease awareness days recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO), it is co-ordinated by the WHO and the World Hepatitis Alliance.
Approximately 500 million people worldwide are living with either hepatitis B or hepatitis C. If left untreated and unmanaged, hepatitis B or C can lead to advanced liver scarring (cirrhosis) and other complications, including liver cancer or liver failure. While many people worry more about contracting AIDS than hepatitis, the reality is that every year 1.5 million people worldwide die from either hepatitis B or C faster than they would from HIV/AIDS.
Hepatitis groups, patients and advocates worldwide take part in events on 28 July to mark the occasion. Notably in 2012, a Guinness World Record was created when 12,588 people from 20 countries did the Three Wise Monkeys actions on World Hepatitis Day to signify the willful ignorance of the disease.
History.
The inaugural International Hepatitis C Awareness day, coordinated by various European and Middle Eastern Patient Groups, took place October 1, 2004, however many patient groups continued to mark 'hepatitis day' on disparate dates. For this reason in 2008, the World Hepatitis Alliance in collaboration with patient groups declared May 19 the first global World Hepatitis Day.
Following the adoption of a viral hepatitis resolution during the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010, World Hepatitis Day was given global endorsement as the primary focus for national and international awareness-raising efforts and the date was changed to July 28 (in honour of Nobel Laureate Prof. Baruch Samuel Blumberg, discoverer of the hepatitis B virus, who celebrates his birthday on that date). The resolution resolves that:"28 July shall be designated as World Hepatitis Day in order to provide an opportunity for education and greater understanding of viral hepatitis as a global public health problem, and to stimulate the strengthening of preventive and control measures of this disease in Member States;"
World Hepatitis Day is now recognised in over 100 countries each year through events such as free screenings, poster campaigns, demonstrations, concerts, talk shows, flash mobs and vaccination drives, amongst many others. Each year a wrap up report is published by the WHO and the World Hepatitis Alliance detailing all the events across the world. 
Focus.
World Hepatitis Day provides an opportunity to focus on specific actions such as:
Strengthening prevention, screening and control of viral hepatitis and its related diseases;
Increasing hepatitis B vaccine coverage and integration into national immunization programmes; and
coordinating a global response to hepatitis to increase access to treatment.
Participants in World Hepatitis Day aim to raise awareness of viral hepatitis, the viruses A, B, C, D and E can cause acute and chronic infection and inflammation of the liver leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
These viruses constitute a major global health risk with an estimated 350 million people being chronically infected with hepatitis B and an estimated 170 million people being chronically infected with hepatitis C.
Approximately 500 million people worldwide are living with either hepatitis B or hepatitis C. , including liver cancer or liver failure. While many people worry more about contracting AIDS than hepatitis, the reality is that every year 1.5 million people worldwide die from either hepatitis B or C faster than they would from HIV/AIDS.

U tvojim molitvama – Balade

U tvojim molitvama – Balade (trans. "In Your Prayers - Ballads") is the first live album by Serbian and former Yugoslav singer-songwriter Đorđe Balašević.

Some tracks feature Balašević's humorous monologues, and the tracks "Ne volim januar" and "Bezdan" feature recordings of Balašević's guest appearance in the Radio Novi Sad show "Pop Ekspres". The album features the previously unrecorded "Samo da rata ne bude", recorded with a children's choir. The song lyrics warn about the war (which indeed will start three years later), delivering a hymn of pacifists throughout then still existing SFR Yugoslavia.

<doc id="18914426" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18914426" title="Imperial Firman of 27 May 1866">
Imperial Firman of 27 May 1866

The Imperial Firman Relative to Hereditary Succession was a "firman" (i.e., decree) issued by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdülaziz on 27 May 1866 at the request of Isma'il Pasha, the "wāli" (i.e. governor) of Egypt, which was then an Ottoman province. The "firman" changed the rule of succession in Egypt from one based on agnatic seniority to one based on male primogeniture in the direct line of Isma'il Pasha. The full text of the "firman" read as follows:
Having considered the demand you have submitted to me, in which you inform me that a modification of the order of succession established by the Firman, addressed to your ancestor, Mehmed Ali-Pacha, dated on the 2nd of the month of Rebiul-Akhir, 1257, confering upon him the Government "à titre d'hérédité" of the Province of Egypt, and the transmission of the succession from father to son, in a direct line by primogeniture, would be favorable to the good administration of Egypt and the development of the well-being of the inhabitants of that Province—<br>Appreciating in all their extent the efforts you have made toward this end since your nomination to the Government-General of Egypt, which is one of the most important provinces of my Empire, as well as the fidelity and devotion of which you have never ceased to give me proofs; and wishing upon my part to give you a striking testimony of the good-will and entire confidence I accord to you, I have decided that henceforth the Government of Egypt and the annexed territories and dependencies shall be transmitted to your eldest son, and in the same manner to the eldest sons of his successors.<br>If the Governor-General leaves no male heir, the succession will fall to his eldest brother, and in default of brothers, to the eldest son of the eldest brother. This shall be hereafter the law of succession in Egypt. Moreover, the conditions contained in the foregoing Firman are, and remain always in force as heretofore; each one of the conditions will be constantly observed, and the maintenance of the privileges which flow from these conditions will depend upon the integral observance of each one of the obligations which they impose.<br>The pledges more recently accorded by my Imperial Government-General of Egypt to maintain 30,000 effective troops, to create a difference between the moneys coined in Egypt, in my Imperial name, and the other moneys of my Empire, to confer the civil grades of my Government as high as the rank of "Sanié" (second rank of the first class), are equally confirmed.<br>The law which interdicts the succession of the male descendants of the daughters of the Governors will be maintained in future as in past.<br>The tribute of 80,000 bourses, paid by Egypt into the Imperial Treasury, is increased to 150,000 bourses, commencing March, 1866.<br>My Imperial "Trade" being issued to put into execution the preceding conditions, the present Firman, bearing my Imperial signet, has been transmitted to you by my Chancellerie.<br>It is incumbent upon you, with that loyalty and zeal which characterizes you, profiting by the knowledge you have acquired of the requirements of Egypt, to consecrate yourself to the good administration of that country; to labor to assure to the people entire security and tranquillity; and, recognizing the value of the pledge I have just given you of my Imperial favor, to observe with fidelity the conditions as established above.<br><br>Done 12th day of the Month of Muharram, 1283.
It was reported that Isma'il Pasha spent approximately $5,000,000 in gifts to the Sultan and to his ministers in order to obtain this decree altering the rule of succession in Egypt. The "firman" restricted succession to the throne to Isma'il Pasha's sons. The latter's uncle, Prince Muhammad Abdul Halim (son of the dynasty's founder Muhammad Ali Pasha), who had been hitherto heir apparent under the old system of agnatic seniority, was thus stripped of his place in the line of succession. Accordingly, he opposed Isma'il Pasha and his successor Tewfik Pasha. Prince Muhammad Abdul Halim's son, Said Halim Pasha, continued to claim Egypt's throne after his father's death.

The Story I Am About to Tell

The Story I Am About to Tell was a successful South African play by Duma Kumalo. Produced by a support group for survivors giving testimony at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and starring three of them, it ran for five years both at home and abroad.
Concept.
The play was designed for travel around and between communities small and large to spread awareness about the Commission and engage citizens in debate around the questions that it raised. The first of the three genuine TRC witnesses was the mother of a lawyer whose head had exploded after his boobytrapped Walkman detonated. Her testimony included a description of a hands-and-knees crawl into the room in which the bloodied mess of body and head remained. The second, a man, described his three years on death row, waiting to be hanged for a crime that he did not commit, while the third, a woman, recounted her arrest, interrogation and rape at the hands of security police.
These testimonies formed the central element of a play, set mostly in a chocker taxi on its way to a TRC hearing, that embraced manifold others. The three witnesses were supplemented by three professional actors who played small roles, offered comic relief and argued about the TRC's merits and proceedings.
Reception.
"The Story I Am About To Tell" featured alongside two other TRC-related productions, "Ubu and the Truth Commission" and "The Dead Wait", at the Laboratory in Johannesburg's Market Theatre. William Kentridge, director of the former, held it in high regard but believed that it formed "only a partial solution to the questions raised by the Commission. Because what the 'real' people give is not the evidence itself, but performances of the evidence. There is a huge gap between the testimony at the Commission and its reperformance on stage. And these are not actors."
On the other hand, he continued, it was often precisely this awkward lack of professionalism on the part of the witnesses which lent their performances their power:
One is constantly thrown back, through their awkwardness, into realising these are the actual people who underwent the terrible things they are describing. The most moving moment for me was when one of the survivors (survivor of three years on death row) had a lapse of memory. How could he forget his own story — but of course he was in that moment a performer at a loss for his place in the script. I have no clear solution to the paradoxes this half testimony, half performance raised. But describe it as one of many possible ways of dealing with the material.
Following one performance, a German spectator found herself in desolate tears. They were not only for the witnesses and their heart-breaking narratives, she said, but also out of anger and regret: she had never in her life in Munich heard similar testimony about her own country's blighted history.

List of Baden locomotives and railbuses

This list contains an overview of the locomotives of the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway ("Großherzogliche Baden Staatsbahn"), the national railway of the Grand Duchy of Baden, a sovereign state within the German Empire until 1920.
Classification scheme.
Locomotives in the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway were organised into classes and were given a railway number as well as names. Their names were derived from the animal kingdom, geographical features (rivers, mountains and towns) as well as people. Because the selection of names became increasingly difficult as more and more vehicles were procured, in 1868 the allocation of names was dropped from locomotive number 218 onwards. In 1882, all name plates were removed.
Railway numbers were issued in sequence. When locomotives were retired, their numbers were allocated to the next locomotives to be delivered. Up to 1882 the name was also adopted. In 1872 an attempt was made to organise the sequence of numbers within locomotive classes. The numbers were swapped around, but locomotives retained the same name. Because there were limits to the practicality of this, it was given up again five years later.
From the 1880s the state railway tried again to organise the railway numbers. Initially shunting locomotives began to be allocated numbers starting at 500. As this threshold was soon reached by the normal vehicle fleet, locomotives were given numbers in the 600s and later in the 1000s.
Unlike other railways, class designations were included from the start. For each new design, a new class number was issued. As a result classes I to XIV had emerged by 1868.
In 1868 a new system was introduced. This entailed engines with the same features or requirements being grouped together.
The locomotives previously organised under the old scheme were transferred into the new classes. In order to improve clarity, the old class designations are shown in "italics".
Using the additional lower case letters "a" to "h", the various sub-types within a class were distinguished. In addition, each delivery batch was indicated with a superscript.
Thus the VI b10 is the tenth batch of Class VI b passenger train tank locomotives.
Steam Locomotives.
The class designations used before 1868 are shown in "italics" in the following tables for greater clarity.
Early Broad Gauge Locomotives for All Traffic Types.
These locomotives were originally built for the Baden broad gauge of 1600 mm and were largely rebuilt on their conversion in 1854 to standard gauge. None of the locomotives were reclassified with Deutsche Reichsbahn running numbers.
Narrow gauge locomotives.
Baden narrow gauge locomotives were built for metre gauge.
Electric locomotives.
Baden's electric locomotives were for the Wiesental and Wehratal railways, electrified on 13 September 1913.
Railcars.
Baden railcars were included in the register of passenger coaches and luggage vans, that were also grouped into classes.

INSOR

INSOR (abbreviated , Institute of Contemporary Development), known until March 2008 as RIO Center (, Center for Development of an Information Society), in a Moscow-based nonprofit think tank affiliated with current president of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, who, as of July 31, 2008, heads INSOR's board of trustees. It is the only non-government organization where Medvedev retained formal influence after the presidential election. Daily management of INSOR is delegated to Igor Yurgens, vice-president and spokesman of Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
History.
RIO Center, established in 2003, initially focused on the ways of modernizing Russia into an information society, moving into National Priority Projects area when these projects emerged in 2005. The projects became a vehicle for elevating Medvedev to the role of Vladimir Putin's successor. 
INSOR was officially launched by Medvedev March 18, 2008 – after the election but prior to his inauguration. Medvedev declared that "civil society should have means to influence the implementation of social policy. And expert discussions of this kind are one of the forms of such influence". 
In July 2008 INSOR made headlines by promoting an unpopular decision to replace regressive rate of employers' social contributions (unified social tax) with a flat 26% tax. The proposal does not affect employers of low-income workforce but targets employers of highly skilled workers, professional firms etc. The change is part of a larger plan to reform Russian social contribution system. Currently, employer contributions are channeled into Pension Fund, mandatory medical insurance and social insurance, none of which can function properly. INSOR proposes to eliminate mandatory insurance altogether and use the savings to finance the deficit-ridden Pension Fund. These proposals are radically contrary to Vladimir Putin's government approach.
Earlier in 2008 INSOR launched an internet portal for the youth, mir4you.ru. It was criticized for a formal approach, lack of own exclusive content, massive copyright violation and numerous factual errors due to unscrupulous use of outdated "borrowed" texts.
Personnel.
INSOR's board of 12 includes, along with Medvedev, state servants (Arkady Dvorkovich, Elvira Nabibullina, etc.) and academics (Yevgeny Velikhov, Yevgeny Yasin). There are no active businesspeople (with a probable exception of Leonid Reiman). Executive staff is primarily academic (Ruslan Grinberg, Vladimir Mau etc.)

He came back 2 years later at the age of 31 and finished 24th with a time of 09:59:34 obtaining him a silver. After becoming marathon champion in 1947 and cycling champion in 1946, Carl concentrated on smaller challenges until 1956, when he attempted the comrades for the 3rd time coming 37th with a time of 10:24:24.
Other achievements.
He concentrated on field and track events in the later half of his life, becoming a champion within veteran and masters athletics. Still to this day he holds the records for: 85-89 years 400m sprint - 2:01.6 ; 85-89 years 800m sprint - 5:21.0
He took up cycling in the 40's and was at one time a Transvaal junior champion.
In his tour of duty with the South African Air Force in the war, he became inland command featherweight champ, putting flight to both Ossewabrandwag and RAF challengers, he recalled in an article with a local newspaper in 2004.
Family.
In 1922, Carl's father was tried for treason for his role in the miner's Rand Rebellion, but subsequently released. Carl married Lois Olive Limbrick and had two daughters and two sons, Carol, Barbara, Peter and Michael.

Sabina Wolanski, married Sabina van der Linden-Wolanski (1927–2011) was a Holocaust survivor and author. Her book "Destined to Live: One Woman's War, Life, Loves Remembered" is a memoir of her account of her experience of the Holocaust.
Wolanski, born in Borysław, Poland (today Ukraine), was 12 years old when her home town in Poland was invaded by the Nazis. In her diary she recorded what happened, including the humiliations and terrors, the murder of her family and her survival. Leaving Europe after the war, Wolanski began a new life in Australia. In 1967, she gave evidence in a trial of the man who had killed her father and brother in Bremen. While there, she met the daughter of a former Nazi who was researching her own past.
In May 2005, when Germany opened the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin, Wolanski was chosen to speak on behalf of the six million dead. In her speech she noted that although the Holocaust had taken everything she valued, it had also taught her that hatred and discrimination are doomed to fail.
Wolanski died on 23 June 2011 in Sydney.

St. James's Abbey, Würzburg

St. James's Abbey () was a Benedictine monastery in Würzburg. It was founded as a Scotch monastery by Embrico, Bishop of Würzburg, about 1134. 
History.
Its first abbot was Macarius (1139–53) who with a few other monks had come from the Scottish Monastery of St. Jacob at Ratisbon. In 1146 he went to Rome to obtain relics and indulgences for his monastery. He died in 1153, and is honoured as a saint. His feast is celebrated on 24 January.
The monks at St. James's were all Irish or Scottish until 1497, when their number dwindled to one or two. The abbey was then given over to German monks, and in 1506 was united with the Bursfeld Congregation. From 1506–16 Johannes Trithemius was its abbot. In 1547 the whole monastery had died out, and its revenues went to the Bishop of Würzburg.
Upon the request of John Whyte, Abbot of the Scottish Monastery at Ratisbon, it was again restored to the Scottish monks by Bishop Julius in 1595, and prospered for some time. Its last abbot, Placidus Hamilton, who, though very learned, lacked the qualities of a good ruler, resigned and retired to London in 1763. From that time till its secularization in 1803 it was ruled by priors. At its secularization it numbered eight monks. The complex became the Garrison Hospital("Standortlazarett") and in 1904, the sanctuary became the garrison church. Subsequent to the bombing at the end of World War II, in 1945, the church was rebuilt and dedicated to St. John Bosco. It is now called "Don-Bosco-Kirche".

Cross File Transfer

CFT (Cross File Transfer) (product name: "Synchrony Transfer CFT") is a secure computer file transfer program and protocol from Axway Inc, used extensively in France and banking industries in Europe.
CFT was for mainframe computers using the French X.25-based Transpac network, but was later ported to use Internet protocols (TCP/IP) as well. Client software must be purchased from Axway, and includes a license manager that enforce machine and transfer limits.
Use.
CFT is used for machine to machine file transfer with remote control for resuming interrupted transfers. CFT can also trigger remote processes, rename files according to a specific protocol (PeSIT, ODETTE (OFTPv1), ETEBAC 3, EBICS), apply security constraints and implement the encoding conversion (ASCII to EBCDIC for example).
Functioning.
Each site wishing to exchange a file is called a partner, regardless of the platform. Any partner wishing to send or receive data from another partner must be declared in “the partners file” or “CFT directory”.
Each CFT partner has an ADL (Address Logic) number. The ADL can identify applications, the users, or even printers. 
To share files, CFT must be installed on each platform. A platform that wants to send a file to a remote partner sends a request over the network by specifying the remote platform through its partner name. When the remote partner receives the request, it verifies that it is the correct destination and creates a record in its local catalogue that lists all requests (treated FIFO). When it’s the request’s turn, the partner establishes a remote connection protocol with the push partner and announces it is ready to receive. The sending partner sends the file content that the receiving partner mirrors to a local directory. The sending partner doesn’t decide where the file is written on the receiving partner. He can not force the receiving partner to receive data (when it is congested, for example). At any time, CFT indicates the status of each transfer: pending, in progress, aborted or completed successfully. 
CFT is a licensed product. It is used with a software key that limits the use of CFT to a type of machine and a maximum number of simultaneous transfers. 
In case of a UNIX Sun Solaris box, one should have the CFT on both the sender and the receiver machines. There are two main config files for XFB (AXway File Broker) namely locpart.smp and chkusr.txt. locpart.smp stores the destination server's IP address, protocol intended, port to be used and other such information. TCP and FTP are the basic protocols used here. The chkusr.txt file contains information specific to authorization and proxy. If a user is sending files to a receiver, the later should have an A entry in its chkusr.txt file in order to authorize the user to send files. It should also contain the landing directory to which the files should be stored in the receiving system. The sending machine also has an agent file named <filename>.perm; which is the one where the file name to be sent is configured and which contains the node name.
Supported operating systems and platforms.
CFT (Cross File Transfer) is (or used to be) supported on wide range of operating systems and platforms:

ECOnetic

ECOnetic is a tradename for certain car models produced by Ford of Europe, currently consisting of one model in each of the Fiesta, the Focus and the Mondeo range, with an emphasis on higher fuel efficiency and low-CO2 emissions.
Design philosophy.
As opposed to developing hybrid vehicles like Prius, Ford of Europe took a different design philosophy: to create vehicles that are as fuel efficient as possible, without compromising driving experience. The resultant ECOnetic range focuses on improved design and refinement of existing technology, focusing on three main streams of improvement:
Models.
First announced in late-2007, Ford proposed ECOnetic models in the Fiesta, Focus and Mondeo ranges. The first cars were available to order from dealers in early 2008, priced at £250 above the "Style" models. Delivered to United Kingdom from April 2008, the models was in the lowest bracket of Vehicle Excise Duty and exempt form the London Congestion Charge.
The second generation Fiesta ECOnetic was launched at the 2008 British International Motor Show. To encourage drivers to be efficient, a green indicator light signals the most economical time to change gear, later introduced to the Focus model.
The 2012 Focus ECOnetic model includes: Smart Regenerative Charging to reduce alternator resistance; Auto-Start-Stop; electrically operated front grille shutter, to improve high speed aerodynamics.
North America.
It is not presently planned to introduce ECOnetic models to the North American market, because, as "Business Week" noted, the company "doesn't believe it could charge enough to make money on an imported ECOnetic" and doesn't think it would sell enough of the model (350,000/year) to justify the $350 million in upgrades required at their Mexico plant to manufacture it.

1927–28 Waratahs tour of the British Isles, France and Canada

Between July 1927 and March 1928 the New South Wales Waratahs, the top Australian representative rugby union side of the time, conducted a world tour encompassing Ceylon, Britain, France and Canada on which they played five Tests and twenty-six minor tour matches.
The Queensland Rugby Union had collapsed in 1919 and would not be reborn until 1929 leaving the New South Wales Rugby Union to administer the game in Australia at the national representative level. Just prior to the start of the Australian 1927 season an invitation from the International Rugby Board arrived in Sydney requesting a New South Wales side tour Great Britain to play Tests against the Home Nations.
In 1986 the Australian Rugby Union decreed the five full-internationals played on the tour as official Test matches.
The squad and its captain.
A squad of twenty-nine players was selected comprising twenty-eight New South Welshmen and one Queenslander in the great fly-half Tom Lawton, Snr who had been forced to come to Sydney to continue his career due to the absence of rugby in Brisbane. The side was captained by Arthur Cooper "Johnnie" Wallace who from Sydney University had earnt a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford in 1922 and whilst there had represented for Scotland in nine Tests between 1923 and 1926.
The selection of Wallace as captain is referred to in the Howell reference as "a masterstoke". He was well known in Britain through his Oxford and Scotland association, was an experienced and naturally gifted player, a strong tactician and a great influence on the younger players. On the nine month tour, the Australians won 24, lost 5 and drew 2 of the matches they played and returned having established an international reputation for playing fair and attacking rugby.
Tour itinerary.
The squad left Sydney by train on 22 July 1927 bound for Melbourne. They played a game on the afternoon of their arrival in Melbourne against a Victorian invitation XV which was won 19–9. They set off in the "Ormonde" from Melbourne on 26 July for Adelaide where they had a one day stop.
By 10 August the "Ormonde" had arrived in Colombo where they were the guests of the Colombo Rugby Union and the tourists played that day against an All Ceylon XV in front of a crowd of 5,000 spectators. They set sail from Ceylon on 11 August. The "Ormonde" passed through the Suez Canal and the Straits of Messina and a disembarkation was made at Naples to enable a visit to Pompeii. Another stop was made at Toulon before arriving at Gibraltar on 28 August and Plymouth by month's end.
The squad had two weeks preparation on land at Teignmouth in Devon before the first tour match against Devon and Cornwall on 17 September. The tourists then relocated to Wales where matches were played at Newport, Swansea and Cardiff.
At Oxford the Waratahs suffered their first defeat 0–3 against a varsity side, although they won the next encounter against Cambridge. Matches were also played at Liverpool, Newcastle and Coventry before they sailed to Dublin. The Waratahs won the first Test of the tour 5–3 against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 12 November.
Two weeks later the tourists met Wales at Cardiff Arms where they triumphed 18–8. From Cardiff they traveled to Scotland where matches were played at Glasgow, Melrose, Aberdeen and the Test loss at Edinburgh. The tourists made day trips to the Lochs, Lomond, Long and Gyll and where shown over the King's castle at Balmoral. Back in Edinburgh castles were visited by day with dinners and theatre parties attended at night.
The party travelled to London for New Year and were shown over the Houses of Parliament by Lord Donoughmore, the Secretary of the House of Lords and Sir James Whitley, the Speaker of the House of Commons. They were presented to the Prince of Wales at St James's Palace and to the King at Sandringham House. At Sandringham they accompanied the King through the woods on a shooting expedition after lunch and were presented to Her Majesty, Queen Mary at afternoon tea.
Later the Australians were flattered by a personal invitation to take tea at the Piccadilly residence of the Duke and Duchess of York where they met the infant Princess Elizabeth. Three other days were spent in the company of officers of the Army, Air Force and Navy culminating in a tour of the Royal Navy facilities at Portsmouth where they were of shown over the workings of the recently launched Australian submarines and , the museum piece and the Royal Yacht "Victoria and Albert III".
Two days after the Test loss at Twickenham the squad left for France, spending a night in Paris before journeying to Bordeaux. There against a selected provincial side the Waratahs suffered the most convincing defeat of the tour with the locals taking an early lead and holding on to a 19–10 victory. Then followed a match in Toulouse against a side representing south-western France in which the visitors prevailed.
Back in Paris, the tourists were entertained and shown the city's splendour before meeting the French national side at Stade Colombes in the final Test match of the tour in front of a crowd of 40,000 with 2,000 gendarmes stationed around the enclosure to keep in check the emotions of the enthusiasts. From Paris the squad crossed the channel and departed from Liverpool in the "Melita" for Canada. They traveled by train from coast to coast with stops at Montreal, Toronto, Banff and Sicamous. Arriving in Vancouver in late February 1928 the squad spent twelve days and played three exhibition matches against varsity and club sides.
In March 1928 they boarded the "Aorangi" in Vancouver to commence the final leg home with stops in Honolulu, Suva and Auckland before arriving in Sydney by month's end, a full nine months after first setting out.

"The game itself was a fast and brilliant exhibition of local forwards versus Waratah backs. Time and again the vigorous Welsh vanguards swept nearly the length of the field but the ball usually found its way amongst the Australian three-quarters who by fast handling, good running and consistent backing up, managed to elude the hard-tackling backs and supporting forwards of their opponents...and due to their excellence the full-time whistle found us with a 10-point advantage".(Towers)

Scotland.
"The playing area at Murrayfield had been covered throughout the week with straw as a protection against the inclemency of the weather and this covering was removed only just prior to the commencement of the match. The day was bitterly cold but notwithstanding this a crowd of 55,000 was present to witness the finest exhibition of the 15-a-side code that has been given for a number of years.
The tactical keynote both in attack and defence of each of those evenly matched sides was speed. With 20 minutes left to play, both sides had scored two tries each, but the local side had converted twice, while the Waratahs had only been successful in this respect once. The spectators were mad with excitement during the last 10 minutes, as a NSW forward crossed the line twice but was recalled for infringements while the Waratah captain, after having beaten the opposition lost his footing on the partly frozen surface. A draw would have been a better ending to the game instead of the 10–8 victory for Scotland, as it dd not seem fitting that such an even and thrilling contest should be decided by a kick. It will suffice to say that the match will live long in the memory of those who witnessed as well as participated in it". (Towers)

England.
England played with the wind at their backs in the first half and made all the running. A dash down the wing, a centring kick and the flanker J.S Tucker was over for a try which was converted 5–0 to England. Wallace made several breaks in the centre and then told Cyril Towers to loop outside him when he broke again. The move was executed brilliantly and with the conversion the scored were tied 5–5.(Zavos)
"Up till half-time, the game had been fast and brilliant, with the Englishmen having a commanding lead of 10 points (15–5) at the interval. Soon after the change over, the locals increased their lead with another try and it was from then that the game reached such a height as a spectacle that it caused the press to place it in number-one position as the greatest game ever seen in England. Even champions of the past, great supporters of bygone games, conceded that the efforts of the Waratahs to make up a deficit of 13 points during the concluding 20 minutes was productive of the finest football imaginable".(Towers)
The Waratahs showed their great fighting spirit by going into an extra-Waratah mode, attacking from everywhere, with John Ford, the massive number 8, taking the ball up time after time. Towers scored 18–8. Then the winger Eric Ford raced through the England defence 18–11. The Waratahs were still attacking the England line desperate to snatch the victory, when the full-time whistle blew. The crowd roared its appreciation of a great game of rugby, with the applause continuing long after the players had retired to the changing rooms and the hot tubs. (Zavos)

France.
"The game resulted in a Waratah victory and the standard of play was high, but the antics of the locals rather distracted us. The mere fact of having to conclude the match that day did not prevent some of the players from lying down for a spell when they were tired, or holding up the game to debate a point with the referee (who did not speak French) while a weep following on a hard tackle seemed to be part of their tactics".(Towers)
The match would ultimately be recognised as the first ever Test between France and an Australian side.

Vargem Bonita

Vargem Bonita is a Brazilian municipality located in the west of the state of Minas Gerais. Its population as of 2007 was 2,098 people living in a total area of 409 km². The city belongs to the meso-region of Oeste de Minas and to the micro-region of Piumhi. It became a municipality in 1953.
Location.
The city center of Vargem Bonita is located at an elevation of 768 meters just outside the Serra da Canastra National Park. The São Francisco River passes by the town after it descends from the Serra da Canastra. Neighboring municipalities are: São Roque de Minas (N), Piumhi and Capitólio (E), São João Batista do Glória (S), and Delfinópolis (W).
The distance to Belo Horizonte is 322 km. The distance to the closest regional center Passos is 80 km. Highway connections are made by BR-146, which was unpaved in 2002.
History and Origin of the Name.
The town began with the discovery of diamonds and once had as many as 30,000 inhabitants. When the diamonds ran out the town lost population and has only become more prosperous in recent years with tourism attracted by the Sierra da Canastra National Park. The slogan for the town is "Tourism, the new diamond of Vargem Bonita".
The origin of the name of the town is rather original. According to tradition, there was a ranch called Várzea in the decade of the 1940s. The word "várzea" refers to the banks of the rivers, often flooded, and sought after by farmers for planting rice and corn.
The story goes that this ranch was praised by a friend of the owner who said: "Mas que vargem bonita!", instead of "várzea bonita". In the local dialect "vargem" is a synonym for "várzea". The owner, José Alves Ferreira, liked the word so much that he changed the name of his ranch, which later became the site of the town.
Economic activities.
Services and agriculture are the most important economic activities. The GDP in 2005 was approximately R$17 million, 7 million reais from services, one half million reais from industry, and 8 million reais from agriculture. There were 220 rural producers on 22,000 hectares of land. 70 farms had tractors (2006). Approximately 450 persons were involved in agriculture. The main crops are coffee and corn. There were 15,000 head of cattle (2006).
There were no banks (2007) and 192 automobiles (2007), giving a ratio of 10 inhabitants per automobile.
Working population by sector
Health and education.
In the health sector there were 3 public health clinics (2005). Patients with more serious health conditions are transported to Passos. Educational needs of 440 students were met by 3 primary schools, 1 middle school, and 3 pre-primary schools.
In 2000 the per capita monthly income of R$210.00 was below the state and national average of R$276.00 and R$297.00 respectively. Poços de Caldas had the highest per capita monthly income in 2000 with R$435.00. The lowest was Setubinha with R$73.00.
The highest ranking municipality in Minas Gerais in 2000 was Poços de Caldas with 0.841, while the lowest was Setubinha with 0.568. Nationally the highest was São Caetano do Sul in São Paulo with 0.919, while the lowest was Setubinha. In more recent statistics (considering 5,507 municipalities) Manari in the state of Pernambuco has the lowest rating in the country—0,467—putting it in last place.

B-wing

B-wings are fictional Rebel Alliance and New Republic starfighters in the "Star Wars" universe. They first appear in "" and subsequently in the Star Wars Expanded Universe's books, comics, and games. A variety of B-wing merchandise has been released by toy companies.
Origin and design.
Although initial plans called for B-wings to appear in several scenes, its narrow appearance from some angles made it difficult to see against the backdrop of space. The ship's rotating cockpit stems from an initial design for the "Millennium Falcon".
Depiction.
Expanded Universe material states that when the Galactic Empire designs the Nebulon-B frigate to protect its convoys from Rebel Alliance X-wings and Y-wings, the Rebels respond by constructing the B-wing. The Verpine, supervised by Ackbar, design and arm the fighter to engage capital ships. The B-wing's gyrostabilized cockpit allows the pilot to maintain a consistent horizon while the craft's body rotates around it. The B-wing is the largest and most powerful fighter designed by the Rebel Alliance, and it is generally viewed as the successor to the older Y-wing fighter/bomber. B-wings have powerful shields which are considerably stronger than the shields featured on most Imperial or Rebel fighter designs, and they are armed with a greater variety of weapons. B-wings participate at the Battle of Endor in "Return of the Jedi" and in numerous other engagements throughout the Star Wars Expanded Universe.
Merchandise.
Both Kenner and Hasbro released B-wing toys, the B-wing is part of two Micro Machines three-packs, and Lego has made several B-wing sets. A Micro Machines Alpha Fleet package includes models both of the B-wing's film appearance and of an initial production design. Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published B-wing cards for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Trading Card Game, respectively. The second expansion pack for the "" flight simulator, "B-Wing", introduces the B-wing as a playable starfighter; several other Lucasarts products also depict B-wings.

L'Aigle à deux têtes

"L'Aigle à deux têtes" is a French play in three acts by Jean Cocteau, written in 1943 and first performed in 1946. It is known variously in English as "The Eagle with Two Heads", "The Eagle Has Two Heads", "The Two-Headed Eagle", "The Double-Headed Eagle", and "Eagle Rampant". Cocteau also directed a film of his play which appeared in 1948. 
Cocteau said that he took his inspiration for the play from the separate stories of Ludwig II of Bavaria and of the Empress Elisabeth of Austria. Ludwig was found drowned in Lake Stamberg in Bavaria in circumstances which have never been satisfactorily explained. Elisabeth was stabbed in the heart by an assassin while out walking in Geneva. For his portrait of the Queen, Cocteau drew upon the portrait of Elisabeth given by Remy de Gourmont in his "Promenades littéraires". He was also concerned to create characters which called for a grand style of acting in a tradition which he saw as being in decline in French theatre. The performances of Edwige Feuillère and Jean Marais in the first French production were an essential part of Cocteau's conception of the play.
Synopsis.
On the 10th anniversary of the assassination of the king, his reclusive widow, the Queen, arrives to spend the night at the castle of Krantz. Stanislas, a young anarchist poet who seeks to assassinate her, enters her room, wounded; he looks exactly like the dead king, and the Queen shelters him instead of handing him over to the police. She sees him as the welcome embodiment of her own death, calling him Azraël (the angel of death). An ambiguous love develops between them, uniting them in a bid to outwit the machinations of the court politicians, represented by the Comte de Foëhn, the chief of police, and Édith de Berg, the Queen's companion. In order to remain true to their ideals and to each other, the Queen and Stanislas have to play their parts in a bizarre private tragedy, which the world will never understand.
Act 1 takes place in the Queen's bedroom at Krantz: evening.
Act 2 is set in the castle library: the next morning.
Act 3 is again in the library: the following morning.
Dramatic analysis.
Cocteau was interested in juxtaposing two characters who represent opposite ideas, a queen with an anarchist temperament and an anarchist with royalist sympathies, and who depart from those identities as they interact with each other as human beings. Other themes which recur elsewhere in Cocteau's work are the poet's obsession with death, and the fulfilment of love in death ("Orphée", "Le Sang d'un poète", "L'Éternel Retour").
Productions.
The play was first performed at the Théâtre Royal des Galeries in Brussels in October 1946, followed by some performances in Lyon. The first Paris performances took place in November 1946 at the Théâtre Hébertot, directed by Jacques Hébertot. The cast included Edwige Feuillère as the Queen, Jean Marais as Stanislas, Silvia Monfort as Édith de Berg, and Jacques Varennes as the Comte de Foëhn. Costumes were by Christian Bérard, sets by André Beaurepaire, and Georges Auric wrote the "Hymne royal" which is heard at the end of the play. The production continued at other theatres in Paris in 1947.
An English version of the play was made by Ronald Duncan under the title "The Eagle Has Two Heads". It was first performed at the Lyric Hammersmith in London on 4 September 1946, with Eileen Herlie as the Queen and James Donald as Stanislas. It was directed for the Company of Four by Murray Macdonald. (Ronald Duncan described his version as an "adaptation" rather than a translation.' Cocteau was unhappy with this English version, calling it "preposterous".) 
The first New York production was staged at the Plymouth Theatre on 19 March 1947, with Tallulah Bankhead as the Queen and Helmut Dantine as Stanislas. According to Cocteau, Bankhead made her own alterations to the play, and the production was a flop.

Albanian parliamentary election, 2009

A parliamentary election was held in Albania on 28 June 2009. No alliance achieved 71 deputies on its own needed to form a parliamentary majority, hence to form the new government the Democratic party and Socialist Movement for Integration joined forces.
Electoral System.
The 140 members of Parliament were elected in twelve multi-member constituencies analogous to the country's twelve counties. Within the constituencies, seats are elected by closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of 3% for parties and 5% for alliances.
Seats are allocated to alliances using the d'Hondt system, then to political parties using the Sainte-Laguë method.
Background.
Prior to the election, the electoral law was changed to a regional and proportional system. Polls from March and April 2009 saw a very close race, with both the governing Democratic Party of Albania and the opposition Socialist Party of Albania around 37%, with minor parties like the Socialist Movement for Integration, the G99 Movement, the Unity for Human Rights Party and the Republican Party of Albania in the low single digits.
Shortly before the election, the ethnic Greek Unity for Human Rights Party switched their allegiance, abandoning their alliance with the Democratic Party of Albania to join the Socialist Party of Albania. The Party for Justice and Integration, a party representing the interest of ethnic Albanians whose properties in Greece were seized after WW2, joined the coalition Alliance of Change.
Alliances.
This election saw a total of 33 parties organized in four alliances, one party running on its own and one independent candidate.
Results.

Regional Level.
The electorate was split in twelve regions, in a regional proportional system, each of which elected a specific number of Members of Parliament (deputet). The following table details the regional results going from North to South.
Aftermath.
Initially the PD led coalition interred into discussions about dividing up the various cabinet posts.
While it was still unclear whether the PD-led alliance held 70 or 71 seats, the leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration (LSI) announced on 4 July 2009 that he had accepted Berisha's invitation to form a government with the PD and stated he wanted to be a stabilising factor in Albania's path towards European Union membership. With the addition of the four seats from LSI, the coalition had the necessary majority to form a government. Nonetheless, in November 2010, the EU in its "Key findings of the Opinion on Albania" found that the political stalemate since the June 2009 elections was a significant barrier to Albania's candidacy for European Union membership.

Jane Couch

Jane Couch, MBE (born 14 August 1968) became the first officially licensed British female boxer in 1998. In a 14-year professional career, she won numerous world titles and announced her retirement from boxing on 1 December 2008. Couch has since become a boxing promoter.
Background.
Born in Fleetwood, Lancashire, Couch was expelled from her school in Blackpool and thereafter lived "a life of booze, drugs and street fighting". At the age of 26 she saw a television documentary about women's boxing and decided to try it. In her first official fight, a Muay Thai match, she defeated a policewoman, about which she said "it was brilliant to flatten one police officer and get paid for it".
She currently resides in Bristol.
Professional boxing career.
The British Boxing Board of Control initially refused to grant Couch a professional licence on the sole ground that she was a woman, and argued that PMS made women too unstable to box. Claiming sexual discrimination and supported by the Equal Opportunities Commission, Couch managed to have this decision overturned by a tribunal in March 1998. However, some criticism followed as the British Medical Association called this result "a demented extension of equal opportunities".
Couch would later seek the right to fight a male opponent, but was unsuccessful. Of this, she said 
Couch's first major success occurred in only her fifth pro fight in 1996 when she won the WIBF light welterweight title by outpointing France's Sandra Geiger over ten rounds in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Couch's first defense of her title was against noted female boxer Andrea DeShong, who was stopped in seven rounds in New Orleans, Louisiana in March 1997.
In September 2003 Staples Center, Los Angeles, California, Couch lost on points over eight rounds to the highly regarded Lucia Rijker of Holland.
Her last fight, against Anne Sophie Mathis on 8 December 2007, resulted in a loss by technical knockout.
She announced her retirement on 1 December 2008 and said she intended to continue as a boxing promoter. At the time, she said 
Couch's overall professional record was 28 wins (9 KOs), 11 losses.
Other achievements.
In 2001 she published an autobiography, "Jane Couch – Fleetwood Assassin".
Couch was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours.
Post-boxing career.
In 2008 Couch competed in the reincarnation of Superstars.
On 20 December 2008 Couch co-promoted a promotion with Ricky Hatton in Bristol and then in February 2009 announced a more formal partnership with Hatton Promotions when she signed as boxing co-ordinator.
Couch long supported the inclusion of women's boxing in the Olympic Games, saying On 12 August 2009 it was reported that the International Olympic Committee appeared set to include the sport in the 2012 Summer Olympics.
In December 2009, Couch promoted a competition at the Marriott Hotel, Bristol.
Couch also has her own YouTube channel which features regular interviews with people involved in boxing.

Lionel Robert Wilberforce

Lionel Robert Wilberforce (18 April 1861 – 1 April 1944) was a British physicist. He is best known for the invention of the Wilberforce pendulum which exhibits a curious motion in which periods of purely rotational oscillation gradually alternate with periods of purely up and down oscillation.
Life.
Lionel Robert Wilberforce was born as son of Edward Wilberforce (1834-1914) in Munich Bavaria. He was a great-grandson of William Wilberforce. He was educated in England and graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1884. He worked with J. J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and was appointed lecturer in 1900. In the same year he became professor of physics at University College, Liverpool (later University of Liverpool). He retired from this position in 1935.
Work.
In 1896 he published his work on vibrations of a loaded spiral spring, today known as Wilberforce pendulum
Most of Wilberforce's time at the University of Cambridge and University of Liverpool was dedicated to the teaching.

Eremophila duttonii

Eremophila duttonii (Budda or Harlequin Fuchsia Bush) is a shrub or small tree which is native to inland Australia.
Description.
It grows up to 3.5 metres in height and has narrow leaves which are 1.5 to 2 cm in length and 2.5 to 8 mm in width.The flowers, which occur from late winter to early summer, are red above and yellow below, or occasionally, all yellow. 
Taxonomy.
The species was first formally described in 1859 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in "Quarterly Journal and Transactions of the Pharmaceutical Society of Victoria" The specific epithet honours Francis Dutton
who later became Premier of South Australia.
Distribution.
It occurs on red, sandy soils in Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. 
Uses.
The Arrente people who call the plant "aherre-intenhe", collect the leaves for medicinal use. 
Cultivation.
The species is seldom seen in cultivation. As it is difficult to propagate from both seed and cuttings, grafting on to rootsock of "Myoporum" species is often undertaken to produce new plants. It is slow growing and prefers a dry, well-drained sunny position. It can withstand moderate frosts.

USNS Huntsville (T-AGM-7)

USNS "Huntsville" (T-AGM-7) was a "Watertown"-class missile range instrumentation ship acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1960 and converted from her Victory ship cargo configuration to a missile tracking ship, a role she retained for a number of years before being struck from the Navy List in 1974.
Victory ship constructed in Oregon.
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, "Huntsville" was laid down under U.S. Maritime Commission contract as "Knox Victory" by Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation, Portland, Oregon, 2 March 1945; launched 13 April 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Charles B. Gilbert; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) 11 May 1945.
World War II-related service.
During the remainder of the war she operated as a merchant ship under charter to Olympic Steamship Company, and she continued merchant service under bareboat charters from the Maritime Commission and the Maritime Administration until 1958 when she entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Washington.
Conversion to missile tracking ship.
"Knox Victory" was acquired by the Navy from the Maritime Administration 11 August 1960 and assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). She was renamed "Huntsville" and designated "T-AGM-7", a missile range instrumentation ship, 27 November. 
After conversion to a special projects ship by Triple "A" Machine Shop, Inc., San Francisco, California, "Huntsville" began duty as a range tracking ship in 1961.
Manned by a civilian crew, "Huntsville" operated out of Port Hueneme, California, and Honolulu, Hawaii, while assigned to special duties in the Pacific Ocean. During the next 4 years she made intermittent "on station" patrols in the Central Pacific, extending from the coast of Mexico to Wake Island and the Marshall Islands. She continued these patrols, which contributed mightily on America's space programs, until the spring of 1965; then she entered Avondale Shipyards, Inc., Westwego, Louisiana, 2 June 1965 for conversion, completed 30 October 1966.
1966 upgrade.
In June 1967 "Huntsville" returned to the Pacific, where she operated with "Watertown" (T-AGM-6). As an improved sea-based tracking station, she provided an important link in communications during the scheduled "Apollo" moon shots, which were designed to send American astronauts to the moon and back.
Inactivation.
"Huntsville" was place out of service on an unknown date, and was struck from the Navy List on 8 November 1974. She was placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet and eventually sold by MARAD on 17 July 1995. Her subsequent fate is not known.

Astronomy and Astrophysics

Astronomy and Astrophysics is a peer-reviewed scientific journal covering theoretical, observational, and instrumental astronomy and astrophysics. It is one of the premier journals for astronomy in the world. The journal is published by EDP Sciences in 16 issues per year. The editor-in-chief is Thierry Forveille (Observatoire des Sciences de l'Univers de Grenoble). Previous editors in chief include Claude Bertout, James Lequeux, Michael Grewing, and Catherine Cesarsky.
History.
"Astronomy and Astrophysics" was formed in 1969 by the merging of several national journals of individual European countries into one comprehensive publication. These journals, with their ISSN and date of first publication are as follows:
The publishing of "Astronomy and Astrophysics" was further extended in 1992 by the incorporation of "Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of Czechoslovakia", established in 1947. "Astronomy and Astrophysics" initially published articles in either English, French, or German, but articles in French and German were always few. They were eventually discontinued, in part due to difficulties in finding adequately specialized independent referees who were also fluent in those languages.
Sponsoring countries.
The original sponsoring countries were the four countries whose journals merged to form "Astronomy and Astrophysics" (France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden), together with Belgium, Denmark, Finland, and Norway. The European Southern Observatory also participated as a "member country". Norway later withdrew, but Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland all joined. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia all joined as new members in the 1990s. In 2001 the words "A European Journal" were removed from the front cover in recognition of the fact that the journal was becoming increasingly global in scope, and in 2002 Argentina was admitted as an "observer". In 2004 the Board of Directors decided that the journal "will henceforth consider applications for sponsoring membership from any country in the world with well-documented active and excellent astronomical research". Argentina became the first non-European country to gain full membership in 2005. Brazil, Chile, and Portugal all gained "observer" status at this time and have since progressed to full membership.
Abstracting and indexing.
This journal is listed in the following databases:
Open access.
All Letters to the Editor and all articles published in the online sections (Atomic, molecular, and nuclear data - Astronomical instrumentation - Catalogs and data - Numerical methods and codes) of the journal are in immediate full open access at no cost to the authors. Articles in the other sections of the journal are made freely available 12 months after publication (delayed open-access model), through the publisher's site and via the Astrophysics Data System, and in both their HTML and PDF versions. "A&A" also provides authors with the option to pay for an open access fee, allowing immediate free access by anyone without charge (hybrid open-access model). "A&A" additionally encourages self-archiving by authors on personal webpages, in institutional repositories, and on the arXiv server. Authors based in one of the sponsoring countries are not charged for publishing in "A&A", while those based in other countries are charged a per-page publication fee. Authors assign copyright to the European Southern Observatory, which allows the journal to liberally grant licences to reuse article material after its publication.

Firefox for mobile

Firefox for mobile (codenamed Fennec), or (Mozilla) Firefox for Android, is the build of the Mozilla Firefox web browser for devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.
Firefox for mobile uses the same Gecko layout engine as Mozilla Firefox. For example, version 1.0 used the same engine as Firefox 3.6, and the following release, 4.0, shared core code with Firefox 4.0. Its features include HTML5 support, Firefox Sync, add-ons support and tabbed browsing.
History.
Plugin support was initially disabled by default, removing compatibility with popular web content types such as Adobe Flash. In September 2011, Flash support has implemented in pre-release builds for pre-Honeycomb versions of Android. Flash support for Android 2.x and 4.x has been enabled for most smartphones in version 14.0, while support for Android 3.x may come in a later release.
The browser's version numbering was bumped from version 2.0 to version 4.0 to more closely match desktop releases of Firefox since the rendering engines used in both browsers are the same.
Release dates:
Name.
The codename used for Firefox for mobile is Fennec. It comes from the Fennec Fox, a small desert fox (just as the Fennec browser is a small version of Firefox browser). Firefox for Maemo Beta 5, released in 2009, was the first release to have official Firefox branding, with Firefox name and logo.
Platforms.
As of version 20, Firefox for mobile is only available for Android 2.2 and above devices with an ARMv6 or ARMv7 CPU.
Official support for the Nokia N900 Maemo device ceased with version 7.
An alpha of version 1.1 (1.1 Alpha 1) for Windows Mobile, released on February 19, 2010, is the last build for this operating system. Following the Windows Phone 7 announcement and Microsoft's decision not to release a native development kit, development for Windows Mobile was put on hold. If Microsoft releases a native development kit in the future for its Windows Phone OS, then Mozilla will consider again developing Fennec for the platform.
Tristan Nitot, president of Mozilla Europe, has said that it's unlikely that an iPhone or a BlackBerry OS version will be released, citing Apple's non-compete application approval policies and as of 2009 BlackBerry's limited operating system as the reasons.
There are no plans to develop Firefox for the Symbian platform.
Mozilla has no plans to develop Firefox for webOS. An unofficial port to WebOS was made, but is no longer maintained.
An unofficial port is also available for the OpenPandora handheld console.
While desktop versions are not supported, versions for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux were available; these versions were intended as a way to give people who do not have a supported operating system the ability to localize, experiment and build add-ons. Firefox Mobile 10.0.2 was the last version available for desktop systems.
Reception.
The main complaints about the browser pre-version 14 were slow browsing speed, lack of plugin support and performance issues. To address these concerns, Mozilla redesigned the browser in version 14.0, adding Flash support, improving start up speed, as well as other enhancements. This update dramatically improved Firefox for Mobile. the average user rating of Firefox for mobile on the Google Play Store is 4.4.

Mortlake Tapestry Works

Mortlake Tapestry Works were established alongside the River Thames at Mortlake, then outside, but near west London in 1619 by Sir Francis Crane.
Royal patronage.
In 1629, Charles I granted "ca."400 acres of Stoke Park at Stoke Bruerne in Northamptonshire, England, together with a manor house to Sir Francis Crane, director and founder of the Mortlake Tapestry Works established on John Dee's estate in Mortlake, in 1619, later the site of the Queen's Head pub.
Crane was made Secretary to Charles I when he was Prince of Wales and was knighted in 1617. With grants of land, money and high prices charged for tapestries, Crane became very wealthy.
The Mortlake works made use of the weaving skills of immigrant Flemish workers. These workers were highly skilled in depicting natural textures and effects such as flesh and water. The 17th century was when the works was at the height of its fame and production.
The tapestries.
Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight.
Lord Leverhulme acquired the Mortlake tapestry series in 1918. It was sold from Stella Hall, near Newcastle, by the family of the industrialist Sir Joseph Cowen (1800–73). The set may have been woven for the hall which was demolished in 1955. In the 17th century it was the home of the Tempests, a wealthy Catholic courtier family, loyal throughout the reigns of the Stuart kings. 
The gallery owns a complete set of six of one of the most popular tapestry series woven at the Mortlake works. It illustrates the ancient Greek story of the tragic love of the priestess Hero for Leander. Leander swam the dangerous currents of the Hellespont, the straits between Europe and Asia at the Bosphorus, in order to see his love, but was drowned one stormy night. 
Mortlake’s chief designer Francis Cleyn designed the series in 1625 and the first set was woven for James I. 
An example is: "The Meeting of Hero and Leander at the Temple of Venus, Sestos", ca. 1660-70, Woven in wool and silk, 286 x 311 cm, accession number LL5464, Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight, Merseyside

Battle of Kütahya–Eskişehir

The Battle of Kütahya–Eskişehir (, ), was fought between July 10 and July 24 (or June 27 and July 10 in the old calendar, then in use in Greece), 1921 when the Greek Army of Asia Minor defeated the Turkish troops commanded by İsmet Pasha in defence of the line of Kara Hisâr-ı Sahib (present day Afyonkarahisar)-Kütahya-Eskişehir. It was also known in some Greek historiography as the Battle of Dorylaion and known in Turkish historiography as the Battles of Kütahya-Eskişehir ( or ). It was part of the Greek Asia Minor Campaign and the Turkish War of Independence of 1919–1922.
Strategically, the battle was of little importance as the Greeks failed to grasp the opportunity to encircle the retreating Turkish troops. This proved later to be a major strategic error, when the two sides had to meet each other again during the much more fierce Battle of Sakarya which turned the tide in favour of the Turks.
Outcome.
The Greek Army managed to break through Turkish resistance and occupied the towns of Kara Hisâr-ı Sahib, Kütahya and Eskişehir, together with their inter-connecting rail-lines.
The Turks despite their defeat managed to avoid encirclement and made a strategic retreat on the east of Sakarya river. On August 5, 1921 İsmet İnönü was replaced by Birinci Ferik Fevzi Çakmak as the Minister of the General Staff ("Erkân-ı Harbiye-i Umumiye Reis Vekili") of the Ankara government after his failure to check the Greek offensive.
This was the major decision point that sealed the Greek destiny in Anatolia. The state and Army leadership, including King Constantine, Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, and General Anastasios Papoulas, met at Kütahya where they debated the future of the campaign. The Greeks with rejuvenated their faltering morale failed to appraise rationally the strategic situation that favoured the defending side; instead, in the overall climate of enthusiasm, the leadership was polarised into the risky decision to pursue an engagement with the Turks on their last line of defence, close to Ankara. Only few voices supported a defensive stance, but they were not heard.
After a delay of almost a month, that gave adequate time to the Turks to organise their defences, 7 of the Greek divisions crossed east of Sakarya River.

Knesset Menorah

The Knesset Menorah (Hebrew: מנורת הכנסת "Menorat HaKnesset") is a bronze monument about five meters high, that is located at the edge of Gan Havradim (Rose Garden) in front of the Knesset. Built by Benno Elkan, a British-Jewish sculptor who worked on it for 6 years, the Parliament of the United Kingdom gave it to Israel in 1956. Built in the shape of the Menorah which appears in Arch of Titus, it includes engravings of some 30 important events, idioms, characters and terms from the Jewish history. It is considered a visual "textbook".
Background.
In 1950, a year and a half after the Declaration of Independence of the State of Israel, Lord Edwin Samuel, son of the first British High Commissioner to Palestine Herbert Samuel, approached the Jewish artist Benno Elkan and asked him to create a bronze sculpture in the form of a menorah, to give as a gift to the young Israeli state . The purpose of the gift was "to express their admiration of the British Parliament and the continued warm friendship with the new State of Israel, its government, its people, and above all - its Knesset." Elkan had lived in London since 1933 when he left Germany following the Nazi rise to power. He was a well known artist in England, and had experience in working in bronze, having created several menorahs, especially that of Westminster Abbey in London. Elkan spent six years of his life creating the Knesset Menorah, much of it in research, because wanted to create a unique work which would tell the millennia-old history of the nation of Israel.
The choice of the Menorah-symbol as a gift is based on the symbol of the state of Israel, chosen by the first Knesset. The design of the Knesset Menorah is similar to that of the state emblem, itself a copy of the menorah which appears on the Arch of Titus in Rome. The Arch of Titus bears a relief depicting captives from the Kingdom of Judea en route to Rome bearing the treasures of the Second Temple after its destruction in 70 CE, including the Temple Menorah. The Arch is dated to 79 AD, and so is considered by some an accurate depiction of the Temple Menorah, assuming that the artist who created the relief he saw with his own eyes the menorah itself.
Structure and Content.
The Menorah contains reliefs of 30 events, idioms, characters and concepts, which Elkan saw as the most important and significant in the history of Israel. Due to the symmetrical shape of the lamp - a central spine with three branches on each side - Elkan decided not to put the reliefs in strict chronological order, but rather opposing each other in the order of the branches. In this way each relief contrasts or complements the relief opposite it. The central spine contains the events which Elkan saw as most central to the history of Israel
The base of the inner pair of branches is covered with a curly geometric decoration; the base of the middle branches is decorated with flowers and symbols of the tribes of Israel, and across the outer branches on either side of the menorah appears a verse taken from the Book of Zacharia: "Not by might, nor by power, but by My spirit, says the Lord of Hosts " (Zechariah 4, 6). These words are taken from a passage in Zacharia which mentions the menorah and olives, hinting at the Knesset's choice of symbolism for the State symbol.
Elkan chose to quote this verse because of its clear association to the state symbol, but it is conceivable that he chose it as well because of its moral, indicating that the power of the people of Israel and God is not physical strength, but rather spiritual strength. This is a significant statement for a work which depicts scenes of war and bloody battles on one hand, and on the other hand figures, events or concepts that express a culture and spirituality of peace.
The Central Spine.
The central branch displays the events, characters and idioms which Elkan saw as most central to the history of Israel.
The War with Amalek at Rephidim.
The head of this branch depicts the war with Amalek at Rephidim as described in the Book of Exodus
The relief shows Moses standing with both hands raised high (without his staff), supported by Aaron and Hur. The unique aspect of this battle was in the strange was is was conducted: not through the physical strength of one army overcoming another, but in Moses' ability to raise his arms. Here also, the Amalekites are perceived as an especially bitter enemy, such that God promises to wipe them out once and for all
The war against Amalek is considered a seminal event in the history of Israel because of the perception of Amalek as the ultimate enemy. In every generation, a new character, associated with Amalek arises, and thus the promise of God to "wipe out the memory of Amalek" is seen as relevant to all generations. There is also a powerful theological message which appears in the Mishnah Rosh Hashanah (3:8): "Does it make sense to say that Moses' hands could make or break the war? This is to teach you - so long as the Israelites looked up, turning their hearts to their Father in heaven, they overcame , if not - they fell."
The Ten Commandments.
The Ten Commandments appear on the Menorah in their traditional form of two rectangular tablets with rounded tops. Written on the tablets are the Ten Commandments as given at Mount Sinai encapsulating the basic tennets of Jewish faith and values. Each commandment is represented on the tablets by their first two words alone. Flames rise in the background of the tablets, symbolizing the burning bush or Mount Sinai aflame at the Giving of the Torah.

Uprising of Georgi Voiteh

The Uprising of Georgi Voiteh (, - Slav Uprising in Pomoravlje) was a Bulgarian uprising against the Byzantine Empire in 1072. It was the second major attempt to restore the Bulgarian Empire after the Uprising of Peter Delyan in 1040-1041. 
The main prerequisites for the uprising were the weakness of Byzantium after the invasions of the Pechenegs in the lower Danube, the great defeat at the hands of the Seljuk Turks in the battle of Manzikert (1071) and the invasion of the Normans from southern Italy as well as the rising taxes during the reign of Michael VII. The uprising was prepared by the Bulgarian nobility in Skopje led by Georgi Voiteh. They chose the son of Serbian Prince of Duklja Michael, Constantine Bodin as their leader, as he was a descendant of the Bulgarian Emperor Samuil. In the autumn of 1072 Constantine Bodin arrived at Prizren where he was proclaimed Emperor of the Bulgarians under the name Peter III. The Serbian Prince sent 300 soldiers led by Vojvoda Petrilo.
An army under Damianos Dalassenos was immediately sent from Constantinople to help the "strategos" of the Theme of Bulgaria, Nikephoros Karantenos. In the battle that followed the Byzantine army was completely defeated. Dalassenos and other Byzantine commanders were captured and Skopie was taken by the Bulgarians troops.
After that success the rebels tried to expand the area under their control. Constantine Bodin headed north and reached Niš. Because some Bulgarian towns with Byzantine garrisons did not surrender, they were burned down. Petrila marched southwards and captured Ohrid and Devol. However, near the town of Kastoria his large army was defeated by the Byzantines and some Bulgarian commanders who did not want to acknowledge Peter III as their ruler.
Another army was sent from Constantinople under Michael Saronites. Saronites seized Skopie and in December 1072 he defeated the army of Constantine Bodin at a place known as Taonios (in the southern parts of Kosovo Polje). Constantine Bodin and Georgi Voiteh were captured. The army which Prince Michael sent to relieve his son did not achieve anything because its commander, a Norman mercenary defected to the Byzantines. The rebellion was finally crushed in 1073 by "doux" Nikephoros Bryennios.

Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica

The Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica ("Corte Suprema de Justicia de Costa Rica") is the court of greater hierarchy of Law and Justice in Costa Rica.
Established on January 25, 1825, its president was the Magistrate Dr. Luis Paulino Mora Mora until his death on February 17, 2013. All of the courts in the country are dependent on the Supreme Court of Justice. Its organizational structure is based around three factors: the matter of the subjects to solve, the territory where they take place and the quantity (amount of money that is involved in the subject).
The Supreme Court of Justice has 22 proprietary magistrates, 25 substitute magistrates in three first rooms and 12 substitute magistrates in the Constitutional Room. They are distributed of the following way: five in each one of the three Rooms of Annulment and seven in the Constitutional Room. They are nominated by the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica every eight years.
History.
Within as little as two months from which they received the news of Independence, the Costa Ricans organized themselves politically and formed their own government. The representatives of different cities and towns formulated the Pacto de Concordia (Pacto Social Fundamental Interino de Costa Rica) on December 1, 1821, and is considered the first constitutional document of Costa Rica. In it they established the Joint Superior Government to exert the government functions and established the Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica to have an authority on law and order in the country, and to lay down the laws over the Spanish and Amerindian population.
By means of Decree V of 24 September 1824 dictated by the Constituent National Assembly of that year, the state was organized by three powers: The Legislative Authority, the Executive Authority and the Judicial Authority. In the judicial branch, the power would reside in the Superior Court of Justice.
Nevertheless, is was not until 25 January 1825, with the Fundamental Law of the Free State of Costa Rica, that the judicial branch took constitutional shape. The Court had numerous initial problems with installation. At this time Costa Rica had a high number of independent lawyers, which made it difficult to completely fulfill the obligations to the Court of Justice stipulated by the Political Constitution. Integration to this new hierarchy of legal authority was difficult for towns in the country where a supreme court was virtually unheard of.
Various elected governors of the Constitutional Congress resigned their positions before their installation, because of financial reasons. On 1 October 1826 the Court was put into operation, The first presidents of the Court were Nicaraguan and Guatemalan. It wasn't until 1842 that a Costa Rican exerted the position of President of the Supreme Court of Justice, in Manuel Mora Fernandez. The situation of Costa Ricans as presidents of the Court improved however after 1843.
For a period of about 20 years, the justice administration was based on the laws of the native Indians. In 1841 however, Braulio Carrillo Colina, governor of Costa Rica, enacted the General Code that included three parts: civilian, penitentiary and procedures, which established the pillars of modern Costa Rican law. In 1843, José María Alfaro Zamora, who replaced Francisco Morazán, set up the Constituent Assembly. A year later, this Assembly formulated a new political constitution, in which it was named the Supreme Court of Justice ("Corte Suprema de Justicia") for the first time and increased the number of magistrates to seven. In 1851, Juan Rafael Mora Porras decreed the Statutory Law of the Judicial Power, that established the organization of justice and the means for legal authority to be conducted by means of election. The Constitution of 1859, summoned by the President Jose Maria Montealegre Fernandez, created a new position of Co-judge, that is today known as a Substitute Magistrate.
In the military coup of 1869, President José María Castro Madriz was overthrown, which provided the background to a revised new political constitution. The Court was divided in two Rooms: First and Second, and the number of magistrates temporarily increased to nine. However, the ascendancy of the general Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez to the Presidency in 1871, saw the writing of a new constitution. It established that the Judicial Power of Costa Rica would be operated by the Supreme Court of Justice and other courts that the law established. In future, the Court would be divided into two Rooms under the responsibility of a president, the number of magistrates returned to seven and a public prosecutor was introduced. In addition, the election of the magistrates were arranged on behalf of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica.
The Statutory law of Courts in 1887 established for the first time the independence of the Judicial Power. There was an attempt to change the Constitution in 1917, but Francisco Aguilar Barquero, president in 1919-1920 was able to keep the 1871 constitution intact in the aftermath.
On 6 September 1937 the Statutory law of the Judicial Power was approved, which reaffirmed Principle Autonomy and established for the first time the division of the Supreme Court of Justice with a Room of Annulment, a Civilian Room and a Penitentiary Room. The number of magistrates increased to eleven. In 1940 the Court was reorganized again in four Courts of appeals, two civilians, two penitentiaries and one of annulment. From that moment it was conformed the Court to 17 magistrates. In 1948, there was an attempt to restore the Political Constitution of 1871, but on 7 November 1949 the Constituent Assembly drew up the revised Constitution that exists today.
Later, there were series of singular innovations in judicial organization. For example, a new Penal Code was introduced and two years later, a Code of Penal Procedures. With the reform of article 177 of the Political Constitution on 25 October 1956, the Judicial Power obtained economic independence of the others. On 30 April 1980, the Legislative assembly approved the Law of Reorganization of the Supreme Court of Justice to improve its organization and the distribution of the work.
With this disposition the Civilian and Penal Courts where converted to the Appellate Civil and Penal Court ("Salas de Casación Civil y Penal"), and the second instance y moved to the Superior Tribunal. Also said law the Secretary of the Courts obtained the capability of authenticating signatures of Notary Public and judicial functionaries.
On June 2, 1982, the Legislative Assembly passed the Reform Law to article 162 of the Political Constitution, through which, the Supreme Court magistrates obtained the right to elect the court's president. On September 1989 the Assembly passed a new reform to the Constitution. This time articles 10, 48, 105 and 128 were modified, creating the Constitutional Room of the court or Sala Constitucional with the mandate that it served to receive and process declarations of unconstitutionality for any kind of laws and regulations and of acts subject to public legislation and made up of seven magistrates finally increasing the count to 22.
On 1 January 1994, Law #7333 substantially reformed the Organic Law of the Judicial Branch ("Ley Orgánica del Poder Judicial"). On 1 January 1998 the Judicial Reorganization Law ("Ley de Reorganización Judicial") was created to reform the Penal Judicial Order. Also, it established a new organization and competency of judicial offices, partially reforming the "Ley Orgánica del Poder Judicial" and revoking other laws.
In spite of the multiple changes indicated above, the Judicial Branch has been one and the same in its spirit. Throughout the judicial history of the country, it has maintained itself strong, in spite of multiple circumstances which have attempet to weaken it.
Functions.
The Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica has the following functions:
The sole exception to the jurisdiction of the Judicial Power exists with the elections, where decisions correspond exclusively to the Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones, according to Article 103 of the constitution.

<doc id="18915482" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18915482" title="Nepal Peace Pagoda">
Nepal Peace Pagoda

The Nepal Peace Pagoda in Brisbane, Australia, is located at the transformed Brisbane World Expo '88 site, South Bank Parklands. It is one of the most significant heritage items in Brisbane from the hosting of the Expo.
Origins.
In 1986, the United Nations International Year of Peace, the Kingdom of Nepal agreed to participate in World Expo '88, and the Association to Preserve Asian Culture was commissioned to create, operate for the Expo, and find a new home for the Pagoda at the Expo's conclusion.
Construction.
The Peace Pagoda was built by German architect Jochen Reier (APAC) on behalf of the Kingdom of Nepal.
Immediately, 80 tonnes of indigenous Nepalese timber were sourced from the Terai jungle forest of Nepal, carted across to the capital Kathmandu where 160 Nepalese families worked for two years at crafting its diverse elements. These were then shipped to Australia in two 40-foot containers and one 20-foot container, where they were assembled at the Expo site by a handful of Australian workers under Nepalese supervision. The final assembly for World Expo '88 only took a few days.
During the Expo.
Three-levelled, with a beautiful tea house on the second level, and one of the only hand-crafted Pavilions, the Pagoda quickly became one of the most visited and photographed Pavilions at the Expo. Towards the end of the Expo a group of persons called Friends of the Pagoda established a petition to keep the Pagoda in Brisbane after the conclusion of the Expo, with some 70,000 signatories.
Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to ascent Mount Everest, was VIP Guest to the Pagoda during the Expo on 8 August 1988.
Artistic and Religious Heritage.
The Pagoda is one of only three Nepal Peace Pagodas outside of Nepal, the other two being in Munich and Osaka, and is a close copy of Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu, with significant Hindu and Buddhist iconography representing the different Avatars of Shiva, buddhas in different states of meditation, or mudras, the eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism, a sacred statue of Avalokiteshvara, the Buddhist deity of compassion, as well as a Peace Bell, two smaller side Pavilions, a Buddhist stupa, and a Peace Post, with the calling to World Peace in four languages Japanese, French, Spanish and English. Sanskrit prayer chants also feature inscribed on the roof eaves of the two side Pavilions, as well as the inscription for om above the central door.
Whilst not used as a traditional Buddhist or Hindu centre, it is occasionally used for weddings, private functions, book launches and company events, and many visitors can be seen using the Pagoda's internal first level Church pews for personal meditation. South Bank Corporation manages the Pagoda on behalf of the Parklands and the City of Brisbane.
After the Expo.
After the Expo, it was work of Friends of the Pagoda, with Brisbane City Council Councillor David Hinchliffe as head, to liaise between government and private donations to keep the Pagoda in Brisbane, and the campaign was a success, largely also due to the last minute concluding successful donation by retirees Mr & Mrs Frank & Myra Pitt. Various ideas were put forward as to where to host the Pagoda, including the Queensland Art Gallery, and Brisbane City Botanic Gardens, with South Bank Parklands the final successful resting place for the Pagoda, at its new riverfront location, where it became part of the parklands opening in June 1992.
Since that time, the Pagoda has been a significant part of one's visit to South Bank, where it still welcomes visitors from all over the world much as it did during World Expo '88.
2008 20th Anniversary of World Expo '88.
As part of the 20th Anniversary celebrations of World Expo '88, Foundation Expo '88 and the newly re-launched The Friends of the Pagoda Association hosted a retrospective World Expo '88 photograph exhibition and memorabilia display at the Pagoda, of which the memorabilia display still is shown to this day. The Queensland Branch of the Nepal Australia Friendship Association (NAFA) also held Nepal-themed poster, pamphlet and craftwork displays at the Pagoda on the World Expo '88 20th Anniversary Community Day, Saturday 10 May 2008.

Fischer assay

The Fischer assay is a standardized laboratory test for determining the oil yield from oil shale to be expected from a conventional shale oil extraction. A 100 gram oil shale sample crushed to <2.38 mm is heated in a small aluminum retort to at a rate of 12°C/min (22°F/min), and held at that temperature for 40 minutes. The distilled vapors of oil, gas, and water are passed through a condenser and cooled with ice water into a graduated centrifuge tube. The oil yields achieved by other technologies are often reported as a percentage of the Fischer Assay oil yield.
The original Fischer Assay test was developed in the early low temperature coal retorting research by Franz Joseph Emil Fischer and Hans Schrader. It was adapted for evaluating oil shale yields in 1949 by K. E. Stanfield and I. C. Frost.

Christina Rahm

Christina Rahm, (c. 1760–1837), was a Swedish operatic singer and a dramatic actress. She was employed at the Eriksberg Theatre in Stockholm from 1780 to 1784 and at the Stenborg Theatre from 1784 to 1799, and thereafter at travelling theatres. She was the first Swedish artist to play Rosina in The Barber of Seville (1785).
Biography.
Christina Rahm arrived in Stockholm in 1782 as the spouse of the wig-maker of the Royal Swedish Opera, Jacob Rahm. She was engaged by Carl Stenborg at the Eriksberg Theatre the same year, and 1784 at the Stenborg Theatre, where she was to be a celebrated prima donna.
Rahm is described as :"one of the theatre's most useful actresses". She participated in both spoken drama as well as opera. She had a good singing voice, which made her often used when the theatre offered opera, musicals and other lyrical performances. She often played the part of soubrette.
Among her parts were: Jenny in "Kungen och skogvaktaren"(The king and the gamekeeper), Lisbet in "Njugg spar", Orphale in "Alexander den Store"(Alexander the Great) (1784), Catau in "Julie" (1786), Rosalie in "Den bedragne bedragaren"(The deceived deceiver) (1788), baron Birkwitz in "Greven av Oldsbach"(The Count of Oldsbach) (1790), the abbess in "The Magic Flute" (1794), and Genevieve in "Richard Coeur-de-lion" by Michel-Jean Sedaine (1795).
On 11 December 1785, she was the first Swedish artist to play Rosina in "The Barber of Seville", a part she played pregnant with her daughter - she had five children. A lot of benefit performances were given to Christina Rahm.
In 1799, the Munkbro Theatre was closed. Rahm toured with the travelling theatre of Anton Lindqvist, where she performed in Gothenburg. In 1800, her husband died in poverty. In 1804–1809, she was a member in the travelling theatre of Carl Stenborg, and performed in Linköping, Karlskrona Kalmar and Gothenburg.
Roles.
When the playwright Didrik Gabriel Björn launched his play "Det besynnerliga spektaklet"(The odd spectacle) (1790), as an after-play to "Greven av Oldsbach" (The Count of Oldsbach) by Brandes translated by Björn, the artists of the theatre were to thank the audience for their support in the guise of their most popular role characters. Björn performed as himself: Magnus Bonn as Mäster Sock in "Skomakaren"(The Shoemaker), Anders Lundberg as Hyrkusken (The Coachman) in "Engelsmannen i Paris"(An Englishman in Paris) by Auguste-Louis Bertin d'Antilly, Johan Petter Lindskog as Bartholo and Bazile in "The Barber of Seville", Jonas Sundman as Jonas in "Mäklaren"(The Broker), Carl Schylander as Mor Bobi and dansmästare Rigadoun, Johanna Löfblad as Gertrud in "Njugg spar"(The stingy saver), Brita Maria Modéer as the maid in "Den obetänksamma"(The Thoughtless one), Christina Rahm as Anna Stina in "Mascarade" by Holberg, Lisette Stenberg as Lady Alton in "Skottländskan"(The Scottish Woman) by Voltaire, Margareta Sofia Lagerqvist as Anette in "Anette and Lubin" by Charles Dibdin, and Eva Säfström as Trädgårdsflickan (The garderner girl) in "Sophie".

Subvalvular aortic stenosis (non-human)

Canine subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS) is an abnormal, congenital heart murmur caused by subaortic stenosis (SAS). There is a high incidence of this condition among Rottweiler dogs.
There is very good evidence that it is heritable, passed on from generation to generation genetically. This genetic trait is what is called polygenic, so that the inheritance is complex. An animal might have the genes for SAS, yet have no actual sign of SAS. Also, an animal might have signs of subaortic stenosis, and yet offspring with signs of SAS may not be seen for a couple of generations. Any animal that has subaortic stenosis should not be bred, because they can definitely pass the defect on to future offspring. There is some controversy as to whether the parents of an animal with SAS should be bred again.
Heart murmurs are graded on a scale of 1 to 6, with one being very mild and six being very serious, with some animals dying before they reach this high stage due to a sudden leap in the grade or through long-term slowing down. Murmurs can exist due to a large number of heart problems (infection, trauma, anemia, etc.; some are innocent, with no cardiac pathology. Tests such as chest X-rays, echocardiography, and electro-cardiography can be performed to evaluate the severity of the situation
Aortic stenosis in the Rottweiler appears to be true subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS), similar to that in the Newfoundland dog, as opposed to the valvular form (seen more in boxer dogs) or the supravalvular form sometimes seen in people.
The condition is usually detected during puppy visits to the veterinarian by hearing a heart murmur during physical examination. A heart murmur is the abnormal sound of blood rushing through one of the heart valves. Instead of just the heartbeat, a whistle of blood flow through a narrowed opening is heard. The puppy will most likely appear normal in all other respects. There is a possibility that the murmur may come and go, or it may develop slowly; this can be determined by frequent checks of a puppy's heart during its first few months. The chance for long-term survival of SAS is low.
Puppies and dogs diagnosed with subaortic stenosis can suffer from heart failure and sudden death. If a dog with SAS develops heart failure, medications can be prescribed to alleviate the clinical signs (sudden/strong lethargicism, heavy panting continuously, rise in temperature etc.).
The OFA has established a Congenital Heart Registry whose guidelines were established by veterinary cardiologists. A dog which auscultates normally at 12 months of age is considered to be free of congenital heart disease; upon confirmation of this, the OFA will issue a certificate.

List of monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty

Monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty reigned over Egypt from 1805 to 1953. Their rule also extended to Sudan throughout much of this period, as well as to the Levant, and Hejaz during the first half of the 19th century. The Muhammad Ali Dynasty was founded by Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian commander in the expeditionary force sent by the Ottoman Empire in 1801 to dislodge the French occupation of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The defeat and departure of the French left a power vacuum in Egypt, which had been an Ottoman province since the 16th century, but in which the pre-Ottoman Mamluk military caste maintained considerable power. After a three-year civil war, Muhammad Ali managed to consolidate his control over Egypt, and declared himself Khedive of the country. The Ottoman Porte refused to acknowledge this title, instead recognizing Muhammad Ali by the more junior title of "Wāli" (meaning governor or viceroy) on 18 June 1805, making Muhammad Ali the succeessor to Ahmad Khurshid Pasha in that position. In the years following his consolidation of power, Muhammad Ali extended Egypt's borders south into Sudan, and eastwards into the Arab Mashreq, particularly the Levant. In 1840, his demand for hereditary control of Egypt and Sudan to be passed to his heirs and successors was accepted and confirmed by the Convention of London, but he was compelled to agree that, upon his death, control over his territories in the Mashreq would revert to the Porte.
Muhammad Ali had a 43-year reign, the longest in the history of modern Egypt. Called the "father of modern Egypt," he is viewed as the dynasty's most important ruler, due to his massive agricultural, administrative, and military reforms. His son, Ibrahim Pasha, was the shortest-reigning monarch of the dynasty. The duration of his rule varies from one source to another, depending on whether or not his reign as regent is taken into account. Contrary to what the short length of his reign might suggest, Ibrahim Pasha is far from being a historically negligible figure, although most of his significant achievements were made before his accession to the throne. His successor, Abbas Helmi I, a traditionalist described by Lord Cromer as "an Oriental despot of the worst type," reverted many of his predecessors' reform-minded measures, and is considered the most controversial ruler of his family.
Sa'id Pasha and Isma'il Pasha were far more open to Western influence, and continued the process of expansion and modernization set up by Muhammad Ali, but on a more lavish scale. Isma'il Pasha is especially notable for his inauguration of the Suez Canal and for his Haussmann-inspired rebuilding of Cairo. However, his costly policy of Europeanisation left the country bankrupt; as a consequence, European creditors greatly expanded their influence over Egypt and Sudan's internal affairs. Isma'il's son, Tewfik Pasha, became increasingly powerless following the Urabi Revolt, and was turned into a puppet ruler following the British occupation in 1882. After his death, his son, Abbas Helmi II, tried unsuccessfully to detach himself from the influence of the British, who ended up deposing him in 1914. The following reign, that of Hussein Kamel, lasted only three years and was thus little more than an interregnum. Hussein Kamel's successor Fuad I was a far more historically significant figure. Described by historian Philip Mansel as "the last great royal patron of history," his reign was marked by the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, and the United Kingdom's resultant recognition of Egyptian independence. The British, however, refused to include Sudan within the sphere of this recognition, and continued to apply the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium. Fuad's son, Farouk I, was Egypt and Sudan's penultimate monarch. After his forced abdication following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, his infant son Fuad II continued to reign as a nominal king-in-exile until the monarchy was formally abolished on 18 June 1953.
Rulers of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty governed Egypt and Sudan as absolute monarchs until constitutional rule was established in August 1878. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy emerged as the most important in the Middle East and the wider Arab world. Largely powerless during the British occupation, Egypt and Sudan's monarchs saw their powers increased following the recognition of independence, and the subsequent adoption of the 1923 Constitution, the most liberal in the country's history. Although King Fuad I often ruled as an autocrat, partly because he repeatedly overrode some provisions of the Constitution, Egypt and Sudan had the freest parliament in the region. During Fuad's reign and that of his son, Farouk, the country witnessed six free parliamentary elections and enjoyed a free press as well as an independent judiciary. According to Philip Mansel, "the Egyptian monarchy appeared so splendid, powerful and popular that King Farouk's ignominious end seems inexplicable." The Muhammad Ali Dynasty's downfall is often regarded as having begun with the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which greatly discredited the King. It accelerated with the growing discontent of Egypt's armed forces following the country's defeat in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Disgruntled members of the military formed the Free Officers Movement, which led a coup d'état on 23 July 1952, thereby marking the beginning of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The toppling of the monarchy, and the resultant establishment of a revolutionary republican government, was the first of its kind in the modern Arab world, and was a crucial event in the region's history; it accelerated dramatically the rise of Pan-Arabism, and had a domino effect leading to similar military overthrows of the monarchies of Iraq (1958), North Yemen (1962), and Libya (1969). Egypt has had a republican form of government since the end of monarchical rule. Although the establishment of genuine democratic rule was one of the six core principles of the Revolution, political parties were banned in 1953 and the country was turned into a military dictatorship. The thriving pluralism that characterized political life during the latter period of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule was thus brought to an end. Even though a multi-party system was officially restored in Egypt in 1976, the country has never recovered the level of political freedom it had enjoyed during the monarchy. In common with most deposed royal families, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty was initially vilified by the new revolutionary regime. Nonetheless, it has undergone re-evaluation in recent years; nostalgia for the former monarchy has been growing among some in Egypt, largely fuelled by the airing in 2007 of a hugely successful serial about the life of King Farouk I.
List of monarchs (1805–1953).
Wilayah/Unrecognised Khedivate (1805–1867).
From 1805 to 1867, Egypt remained legally a nominal Ottoman province governed by a Wāli on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, although it was "de facto" virtually independent, with its wālis styling themselves as Khedives. Despite their legally subservient status, Egypt's wālis enjoyed far more political power than their descendants, who were to rule the country as nominally independent sultans and kings decades later. Throughout the 19th century, the legal fiction of Ottoman suzerainty was nonetheless symbolically maintained through Egypt's payment of an annual tribute. Moreover, although the Muhammad Ali Dynasty became a hereditary monarchy in 1840, each new ruler had to receive a "firman" (Arabic word for decree) from the Ottoman Sultan appointing him as Wāli in order to be formally invested with his office. Until 1866, Egypt's laws of succession followed the principle of agnatic seniority, which means that the reigning wāli always had to be the eldest male member of the dynasty. Rulers thus inherited the throne based on their age, not on their degree of proximity. This explains why none of Ibrahim Pasha's successors was directly succeeded by his own son.
Khedivate (1867–1914).
On 8 June 1867, Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz formally recognized Isma'il Pasha by the title Khedive, which ranked higher than that of Vizier but lower than that of Caliph. The Khedivate of Egypt was still nominally a subject of the Ottoman Sultan, and its rulers were still technically appointed and dismissed by an imperial "firman". Nevertheless, the Khedive actually exercised most sovereign powers, including the appointment of his council of ministers, the rector of Al-Azhar, and high-ranking military and naval officers. He could also sign treaties with foreign powers and borrow money for the state treasury. On 17 May 1866, the rule of succession in Egypt was changed from one based on agnatic seniority to one based on male primogeniture in the direct line of Isma'il Pasha. After the British occupied the country in 1882, the Khedive's exercise of power was limited greatly by the advice of the British agent and consul general, who became the "de facto" ruler of the country.
Sultanate (1914–1922).
On 19 December 1914, Abbas Helmi II was deposed by the United Kingdom while he was on a visit to Vienna due to his anti-British stance. The British severed Egypt's nominal ties to the Ottoman Empire, thus ending the country's status as a khedivate. Prime Minister Hussein Rushdi Pasha served as acting head of state until Abbas Helmi II's half-uncle Hussein Kamel was chosen as the country's new monarch. For a brief while, the British had considered putting an end to the Muhammad Ali Dynasty and installing Aga Khan III as ruler. Hussein Kamel took the title of "Sultan of Egypt" (preceded by the untranslatable style of "Sa Hautesse"), thereby putting him on an equal footing with the Ottoman Sultan. However, the end of nominal Ottoman suzerainty over Egypt did not result in genuine independence; the Sultanate of Egypt was a British protectorate where real power lay in the hand of the High Commissioner.
Kingdom (1922–1953).
On 28 February 1922, the United Kingdom issued a declaration through which it unilaterally ended its protectorate over Egypt. As a result, Sultan Fuad I promulgated a decree on 15 March 1922 whereby he adopted the title of "King of Egypt". It has been reported that the title change was due not only to Egypt's newly independent status as the Kingdom of Egypt, but also to Fuad I's desire to be accorded the same title as the newly installed rulers of the newly created kingdoms of Hejaz, Syria and Iraq. Egyptian nationalist leader Saad Zaghlul maintained that the reason for the change of title from Sultan (equivalent to emperor) to the lesser title of King was because the British would not recognize an independent Egyptian ruler whose title was superior to their own monarch.
Egyptian independence was limited severely by the continuing British occupation of the country. British influence remained pervasive, as evidenced by the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which almost led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas introduced, and Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I "King of Egypt and the Sudan". The move was intended to further Egypt's claims over Sudan, which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.

Álvaro of Lencastre, 3rd Duke of Aveiro

Álvaro of Lencastre (1540–1626) was the son of Afonso of Lencastre, second son of infante George of Lencastre, 2nd Duke of Coimbra.
Disputed Inheritance.
When George of Lencastre, 2nd Duke of Aveiro died, in 1578 in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, together with King Sebastian I of Portugal and most Portuguese nobles, the Dukedom of Aveiro was claimed by two pretenders:
According to the "Lei Mental" (Mental Law), females could not inherit their father’s lands and fiefs (except with a specific royal permission). That was why Álvaro of Lencastre claimed his cousin's inheritance, to prevent the extinction of such a remarkable aristocratic House.
This dispute took about 2 decades, and finally, King Philip I of Portugal (also known as Philip II of Spain) decided that "Dom" Álvaro should marry his cousin, "Dona" Juliana, in order to inherit his family titles and estates, and they became jointly 3rd Dukes of Aveiro.
This marriage took place in 1598 and, for that occasion, the King granted the Dukes special honours:
The Ducal Palace was located in Azeitão, where, attached to the palace, they also built a hospital. They granted a huge protection to the Arrábida convent, founded by the 1st Duke, John of Lencastre, where they both are buried.
The couple had sixteen children:

Imperial diptych

In Late Antiquity, an imperial diptych is a theoretical type of ivory diptych, made up of two leaves of five panels each and each with a central panel representing the emperor or empress. They are so-named in contrast to consular diptychs. They were produced as unique examples, whereas each consular diptych was produced in large numbers to offer to the emperor on certain occasions, principally a nobleman's entry to the consulship.
No complete example of an imperial diptych survives and so their existence is contested. The ivories specialist R. Delbrück has theorised that the 19 surviving fragments of ivory panels which clearly do not belong to the usual type of consular diptychs constitute evidence of imperial diptychs, despite having many characteristics in common with consular diptychs. The iconography of these diptychs obeys a stereotypical scheme, as illustrated by the Barberini ivory, which is the best example of the posited type - an imperial diptych's programme would be made up of a central figure of the emperor or empress, figures of dignitaries on its side panels, an upper register showing a personification of Constantinople or a medallion with a bust of Christ and a lower register showing barbarians making offerings to the emperor. However, the fact that the Barberini ivory was almost certainly not a diptych, but some kind of imperial icon without a second panel is a serious argument against the existence of the imperial diptych type.
The two panels representing the empress Ariadne, in the Bargello in Florence and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, also belong to the hypothesied imperial diptych type. They are the only central panels of such a diptych (other than the Barberini ivory) to survive, since all other fragments of such diptychs are from side panels.

Eric Lamaze

Eric Lamaze (born April 17, 1968) is a member of the Canadian Equestrian Team for show jumping. He and his best known horse, Hickstead, completed the rare feat of only having one rail fall during the entire Olympic Games.
Early life.
He was born in Montreal, Quebec. Lamaze was taught to ride at a young age by celebrated coach Diane Dubuc, in Montreal. Dubuc spent timeless hours with Lamaze, helping him create a foundation for his career in Jumping. Currently Dubuc runs a stable in Montreal called Day By Day Stables, where Lamaze still has ties. Lamaze has credited show jumping with helping him get past his tough childhood and turning around his life.
Lamaze currently lives in Schomberg, Ontario, where he coaches at his own barn, Torrey Pines.
Career.
In 2007, Lamaze became the first Canadian jumping rider in 20 years to make the top ten in the world rankings. He was also the first North American jumping rider to exceed one million in prize money a year, a third of these earnings came as a result of winning the CN International Grand Prix at Spruce Meadows.
In the January 2009 Rolex World Rankings for show jumping by the International Equestrian Federation, Lamaze was named to the top spot for the first time. Lamaze returned to No. 1 for July 2010
Olympics.
Lamaze was named to the Canadian team for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, but lost his place and received a four year suspension after testing positive for cocaine. Arbitrator Ed Ratushny overturned the suspension, although Lamaze had already missed the Atlanta Games when the ruling was delivered.
Lamaze rebuilt his career and ascended the rankings, being again regarded as a key member of the Canadian team for the Sydney Games. However he tested positive for a banned stimulant, which resulted in his removal from the team and facing a lifetime ban. Right afterwards, a despondent Lamaze contemplated suicide and while drunk he smoked a cigarette laced with cocaine. Forty-eight hours later, the test for the banned stimulate was reversed on appeal, however Lamaze then tested positive for cocaine which would also have meant a lifetime ban. Arbitrator Ed Ratushny overturned the cocaine test, but the Canadian Olympic Committee refused to reinstate Lamaze on the Canadian team.
Lamaze competed in the Beijing Olympics, riding the stallion Hickstead. He was awarded a silver medal after a strong performance in the team event. Lamaze went on to win a gold medal in the individual show jumping event of the 2008 Beijing Olympics at the Shatin Equestrian Venue in Hong Kong as a result of a "jump off" between him and the Swedish rider Rolf-Göran Bengtsson, riding Ninja.
After the untimely death of Hickstead in 2011, Lamaze selected the nine-year-old mare Derly Chin De Muze to ride at the 2012 London Olympics.

OSF Saint Francis Medical Center

OSF Saint Francis Medical Center, located in Peoria, Illinois, United States, is a teaching hospital for the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria and part of the OSF Healthcare System. The Center, which is the largest hospital in the Peoria metropolitan area and in central Illinois, is designated by the state of Illinois as the Level I adult and pediatric regional trauma center for a 26-county region in mid-Illinois. OSF Saint Francis owns the Children's Hospital of Illinois (though the Hospital has its own President), the OSF Saint Francis Heart Hospital, the Illinois Neurological Institute, and the OSF Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing, which are all located either in or near the Medical Center. The hospital is a clinical training hospital for many medical students, interns, residents, and fellows of the Peoria campus of the University of Illinois College of Medicine.
It is the largest Level I trauma center for adults and children between the Chicago and Rockford metropolitan areas and the St. Louis metropolitan area. It is the fourth largest hospital in Illinois. 
The hospital offers adult and pediatric renal transplantation and adult pancreatic transplantation; generally, adult and pediatric cardiac transplantation cases are referred to tertiary care academic medical transplantation centers in Chicago. The hospital offers basic and intermediate burn care; severe cases are transferred to the Springfield burn unit, and less commonly, to Chicago or St. Louis.
The hospital made national and international headlines in the health care field on April 9, 2013, when a toddler, about 3, from South Korea (born to a Canadian father and South Korean mother) who was born without a trachea (a windpipe) received an artificial trachea that incorporated, with the plastic, her own living stem cells (the adult type), in the first bio-engineered transplant on a child in the U.S. and the first bio-engineered trachea transplant in the world. It is the first stem cell procedure of any kind at the Catholic medical center. The major 11-hour surgical procedure was led by Dr. Paolo Macchiarini of Sweden's Karolinska Institute, along with top surgical and medical officials from OSF. 
Awards.
In 2000, the Center was listed among the "Most Wired Hospitals and Health Systems" by "Hospitals & Health Networks", an indicator of the degree to which information technology was used in the Center.
The Center received a Lantern Award in 2013 for nursing care in the emergency department. 
The Center is also the #1 hospital in the state of Illinois for organ recovery.
History.
The first hospital unit of what later became the Center was established in 1876 by a group of Franciscan Sisters who had been sent to Peoria, Illinois from a German expatriate group settled in Iowa City, Iowa. In 1877, the Sisters who had migrated to Peoria were granted permission to form an independent religious community and became "The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis, Peoria, Illinois".
In 2006, OSF Saint Francis Medical Center developed a comprehensive program called "Save Our Skin" designed to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers. The key elements include upgrading mattresses, clarifying staff roles and protocols, and improving measurement and communication of pressure ulcer performance data. The program reduced the incidence of pressure ulcers from 9.4 percent in 2001 to 1.5 percent in 2006, well below the national average range of 7 to 10 percent, and yielded estimated cost savings of $3 million annually.
In 2009 and 2010, the Medical Center built a new emergency room. A new Children's Hospital of Illinois was built, with a new Level I pediatric and a Level III neonatal intensive care unit (the only one in Central Illinois) and emergency room. The Milestone Project was the largest expansion in the hospital's history. The hospital is now home to most pediatric and adult services.
Organization.
The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis (led by Sister Judith Ann Duvall, O.S.F.) is established as a non-profit organization and is the parent company of OSF Healthcare, which in turn is the operator of the OSF Healthcare System. The religious order of nuns and the hospital is not considered a part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria, but still works closely with it. The System consists of 10 facilities in Illinois, including the Center, plus one in Escanaba, Michigan.

<doc id="18915874" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18915874" title="Fixed Survey Meter">
Fixed Survey Meter

The Fixed Survey Meter was a specialist detection instrument used by the Royal Observer Corps during the Cold War between 1958 and 1982 to detect ionising radiation from nuclear fallout generated by a ground burst.
Overview.
The instrument was designed and built by the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston as a replacement for the Radiac Survey Meter No 2 which could only be used above ground. The Royal Observer Corps’ need was for an instrument that could be read from inside the protected environment on the underground post.
The instrument had an analogue mechanical dial with a pivoted needle indicator on a scale that covered 0.1 roentgens to 500 roentgens. Powered by three obsolete high voltage batteries (15 volt and 30 volt), that had to be specially manufactured, the meter was contained in a sturdy enamelled metal case. The controls featured an on-off switch combined with a calibration adjustment and a multi-position battery test switch.
The batteries were contained within a clip-on cassette that took several minutes of careful preparation. A spare cassette was also pre-prepared to enable quick battery changes during operations.
The meter was connected by a heavy duty cable to an ionisation chamber mounted onto a telescopic rod that was fed up a probe pipe in the ceiling of the monitoring post so that the probe was above ground. The top of the probe was protected by a polycarbinate dome that prevented fallout from entering the post.
Operations.
The delicate instruments were kept at the group controls in an air conditioned and de-humidified storage room and only issued to posts during Transition To War. Once at the posts the instrument was unpacked from its wooden transit case and prepared for use.
If radiation readings approached the 400 roentgen level the telescopic rod was quickly collapsed and the probe reinserted to a distance below the surface that reduced the dial reading by a factor of ten. Thus the instrument became capable of producing accurate readings to a level of 5,000 roentgens per hour external reading. Shielded readings were prefixed with the word "Red". When readings fell again to an indicated reading of 40 the probe was restored to full height.
Once fallout had arrived anywhere in the group regular five minute readings were taken from all posts and displayed on the post boards in the operations room
Codeword.
The arrival of any radioactive fallout at the post was reported immediately with the codeword FIRST FALLOUT followed by post designation and the time e.g. "First Fallout - Shrewsbury 56 post - Oh three fifty two".
Training.
Posts were provided with a dummy FSM trainer, known as the FSMT, that was identical in every way to the operational instrument except that it had a slot on its rear that permitted a roll of plastic trace, fed into the machine by a clockwork mechanism, to make the dial operate realistically over the 24 or 48 hours of a weekend exercise.
Withdrawal.
Between 1983 and 1984 the FSM and FSMT were withdrawn from use and scrapped. The instrument was replaced by the Plessey PDRM82(F), the fixed version of the new Civil Defence meters. The new polycarbonate cased meters were less delicate and this permitted them to be permanently stored at the monitoring posts instead of being retained at the group controls.

Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha at the Commonwealth Games

The British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, simply known as "Saint Helena", the most populous region in the territory, has competed in five Commonwealth Games. The first was in 1982, after which they were absent from the Games for sixteen years, before returning in 1998. They have competed in every subsequent Games to date. Saint Helena has never won a medal at the Commonwealth Games.
The territory changed its name in 2009 — previously it was known as "St Helena and Dependencies". The remoteness of the territory and lack of transport links to the rest of the world makes it difficult for teams to reach the Commonwealth Games.

As We May Think

As We May Think is an essay by Vannevar Bush, first published in "The Atlantic" in July 1945, and republished again as an abridged version in September 1945 — before and after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of collective memory machine with his concept of the memex that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion.
Concept creation.
The article was a reworked and expanded version of Bush's 1939 essay "Mechanization and the Record". Here, he described a machine that would combine lower level technologies to achieve a higher level of organized knowledge (like human memory processes). Shortly after the publication of this essay, Bush coined the term "memex" in a letter written to the editor of "Fortune" magazine. That letter became the body of "As We May Think," adding only an introduction and conclusion. As described, Bush's memex was based on what was thought, at the time, to be advanced technology of the future: ultra high resolution microfilm reels, coupled to multiple screen viewers and cameras, by electromechanical controls. The memex, in essence, reflects a library of collective knowledge stored in a piece of machinery described in his essay as "a piece of furniture." The "Atlantic" publication of Bush's article was followed, in the September 10, 1945 issue of Life magazine, by a reprint that showed illustrations of the proposed memex desk and automatic typewriter. (Coincidentally, the same issue of "Life" contained aerial photos of Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb, a project Bush was instrumental in starting). Bush also discussed other technologies such as dry photography and microphotography where he elaborates on the potentialities of their future use. For example Bush states in his essay that "the combination of optical projection and photographic reduction is already producing some results in microfilm for scholarly purposes, and the potentialities are highly suggestive." 
Concept realization.
"As We May Think" predicted (to some extent) many kinds of technology invented after its publication, including hypertext, personal computers, the Internet, the World Wide Web, speech recognition, and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia: "Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified." Bush envisioned the ability to retrieve several articles or pictures on one screen, with the possibility of writing comments that could be stored and recalled together. He believed people would create links between related articles, thus mapping the thought process and path of each user and saving it for others to experience. Wikipedia is one example of how this vision has been realized, allowing users to link words to other related topics, while browser user history maps the trails of the various possible paths of interaction.
Bush's article also laid the foundation for new media. Doug Engelbart came across the essay shortly after its publication, and keeping the memex in mind, he "began work that would eventually result in the invention of the mouse, the word processor, the hyperlink and concepts of new media for which these groundbreaking inventions were merely enabling technologies." 
At the same time, a reader now may be surprised how little some technologies have actually advanced since "As We May Think" was published during 1945. It is true that, for instance, storage has greatly surpassed the level imagined by Vannevar Bush, who wrote: "The "Encyclopedia Britannica" could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk". However, technologies such as speech recognition and associative ways of indexing information are largely underdeveloped and most individuals are interacting with computers in non-natural ways, adapting to technology instead of having technology adapt to users. Automated speech recognition was possible at that time already in the form of early vocoders, but is still rarely used to type texts or operate computers. Indexing of information at the time is described by Bush as being artificial: "When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used." This description resembles popular file systems of modern computer operating systems (FAT, NTFS, ext3 when used without hard links and symlinks, etc.), which do not easily enable associative indexing as imagined by Bush.
Outlook in the use of science.
Bush urges that scientists should turn to the massive task of creating more efficient accessibility to our fluctuating store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended people's physical powers rather than the powers of their mind. He argues that the instruments that are at hand which, if properly developed, will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments, he suggests, should be the first objective of our scientists.
Through this process society would be able to focus and evolve past the existing knowledge rather than looping through infinite calculations. We should be able to pass the tedious work of numbers to machines and work on the intricate theory which puts them best of use. If humanity were able to obtain the "privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if proven important" only then "will mathematics be practically effective in bringing the growing knowledge of atomistic to the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry, metallurgy, and biology". To exemplify the importance of this concept, consider the process involved in 'simple' shopping: "Every time a charge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done. The inventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit for the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and most important, the customer needs to be charged." Due to the convenience of the store's central device which rapidly manage thousands of these transactions, the employees may focus on the essential aspects of the department such as sales and advertising.
Indeed as of today, "science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than of an individual". Improved technology has become as extension of our capabilities, much as how external hard drives function for computers so it may reserve more memory for more practical tasks.
Another significant role of practicality in technology is the method of association and selection. "There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his synthesis are not likely to keep up with the current scene." Bush believes that the tools available in his time lacked this feature, but noted the emergence and development of such ideas such as the Memex, a cross referencing system.
Bush concludes his essay by stating that through the application of science, which had recently been used to "throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons," he hopes could help the human race "encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience."
Outline.
Many scientists, especially physicists, get new duties during the War. Now, after the war, they need new duties.
"Section 1:" The use of Science has improved tremendously in many ways for humans. The knowledge of science has grown considerably. However, the way we manage it still remains the same for centuries. We are no longer able to use what Science finds out. Alternatively, the technology has matured greatly and allows us to now produce complicated, yet cheap and dependable machines.
"Section 2:" Science is really useful. However, in order to have it to be very efficient and useful it should not only be stored but also be frequently consulted and enhanced. In the future we would probably be able to store human writings in a small room with the use of photography.
"Section 3:" Using the latest advances of speech recording and stenography, we will soon be able to make printing immediate. The advancement of photography is not going to stop. The thought process of repetition could be in relation to machine. Electrical machines will be the advancement of arithmetical computation.
"Section 4:" There is more to the scientific reasoning than just arithmetic. There are a few machines that are not used for arithmetic, partly due to the market’s needs. Solving higher mathematics require other repetitive processes of thought to be mechanized.
"Section 5:" A machine could be used anywhere where there is logical thought process. At this moment we do not have the necessary tools for the selection (the key to utilize science) of knowledge. One of the best forms of selection is illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange.
"Section 6:" There is a problem with selection. The main problem of it is the deficiency of the indexing systems. When data is recorded and put into storage, it is usually filed alphabetically or numerically. The human mind works differently. It works according to association. Instead of using selection by indexing, selection by association may be mechanized. Thus, improving the permanence and clarity of the items stored. The memex is a device that could store information and communication (large memory). Some things that can be entered are, newspaper and books. The user is also able to find a particular book as he or she taps on its code on the keyboard. The codes that are frequently used to call forth pages are mnemonic and its possible to browse these pages at different speeds.
"Section 7:" The main feature of the memex is the ability to tie two things together at will. In other words, to be able to associate two arbitrary items when wanted. The user is also able to build a trail, in which they name it, insert a name into the code book, and then taps it out on the keyboard. At any time, the user is able to view two items at the same time, parallel viewing. It is also possible to pass items to another memex.
"Section 8:" The trails made can be shared with others and can also be published, like an encyclopedia (many more new forms are to appear). Soon we will be able to establish some kind of direct connection with absorbing material of the record with one of our senses, tactilely, orally, and visually. It would be great for humans to be able analyze present issues. As of now, science has been applied to live better, as well as for destruction. Possibly we may be able to apply the record to become wiser.

A166 road

The A166 road is a trunk road between the outskirts of York and Driffield in the historic county of Yorkshire. The road used to terminate at the seaside town of Bridlington, until the opening of the Driffield by-pass caused the final section to be renumbered as the A614.
History.
The A166 follows the path of an old Roman Road from York to Stamford Bridge, where it forded the river at the place where the modern bridge is located. The bridge is mentioned in Anglo-Saxon Chronicles about the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. The road was turnpiked between York and Stone Dale as part of the York, Kexby Bridge, Grimston and Stone Dale Turnpike Trust established in 1806. A turnpike Trust had existed since 1765, but this included new maintenance provisions. The Trust lasted until 1872.
There are a number of Scheduled Ancient Monuments that lay alongside the A166, most notably in the area of Garrowby Hill: 
In 1983, the Driffield by-pass was built and became the route of the A166, which had previously gone through the centre of the busy market town. The by-pass was renumbered in 1996 to become the A614 and thus shorten the historic old road.
In 2008, a feasibility study was carried out and proposals were put forward on behalf of the East Riding of Yorkshire Council for an alternative crossing of the River Derwent at Stamford Bridge. The current Grade II listed bridge only allows for one way flow and is controlled by traffic lights. It has a record for causing peak hour delays during the working week. Alternative routes included utilising the disused York to Beverley railway line crossing downstream from the current bridge. Also adding a new structure right next to the existing bridge was put forward. Other proposals involved two routes to the north of the river, one crossing just north of the caravan site on Buttercrambe Road and the other a complete new by-pass missing the village altogether. The report concluded that the best options did not score well enough for the Regional Transport Board to take forward and should not be pursued.
In 2009, the stretch of the A166 along Main Road and York Road, between the turnings for the B1248, in Wetwang was the location for the third and final intermediate sprint during that year's Tour of Britain Stage 1.
Route.
The road starts as an exit on the Grimston Bar interchange on the A64 on the outskirts of York. It heads north east pass the turnings for Murton, after , Dunnington after and Holtby after . The first settlement that lies upon the road is Gate Helmsley at from the start. From here the road gradually turns in an easterly direction until it is required to cross the River Derwent at Stamford Bridge, some from its starting point.
The bridge lies north east to south west at the point where there used to be a fording point. On exiting the town, the road returns to a north east direction to follow the route of the old Roman road. At distance, there is a turning northward toward the hamlets of Buttercrambe and Scrayingham at which point it turns easterly again. This is closely followed by a staggered junction further on with an exit south towards Full Sutton and north to Skirpenbeck. There are also turnings in the next south to Youlthorpe and north to Bugthorpe.
After distance the road takes a sharp turn south and then back east at the foot of Garrowby Hill. The hill is the highest point on the Yorkshire Wolds and was the subject of a painting by David Hockney. The road up the hill covers , rising from to at an average gradient of 4.8%. Part way up the hill at distance, is the southerly turn off toward Bishop Wilton. Shortly after this junction an emergency stopping track can be seen on the downward side of the road. Consisting of gravel and sand, this is intended for vehicles to use in the event of a mechanical problem. There are several places where the road has been widened to allow slower traffic ascending or descending to pull to the left and allow faster vehicloes to pass. In the next , there are junctions with the routes to Great Givendale and Pocklington to the south and Thixendale to the north. At a dip and curve in the road known as Stone Dale, the road once more goes in a north east direction.
After distance it arrives at Fridaythorpe. On exiting the village, the road meets the B1251 road to Bridlington, which is designated as a "Scenic Route". Travelling in an easterly direction, the road follows an ancient "Green lane" until it reaches the village of Wetwang at distance. Either side of the village the road intersects the B1248 Beverley to Malton road. The road continues to Garton-on-the-Wolds at distance, where it is met by the B1251 heading north west to Sledmere.

USNS Wheeling (T-AGM-8)

USNS "Wheeling" (T-AGM-8) was a "Wheeling"-class missile range instrumentation ship acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1962 and converted from her Victory ship cargo configuration to a missile tracking ship, a role she retained for a number of years before being sunk as a target by Harpoon missiles on 12 July 1981.
Victory ship built in Oregon.
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, "Wheeling" was laid down on 10 April 1945 as "Seton Hall Victory" by the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MCV hull 686); launched on 22 May 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Ross Mclntyre; and delivered to the Maritime Commission on 21 June 1945.
World War II-related service.
From July 1945 to September 1957, "Seton Hall Victory" was operated for the U.S. Maritime Commission by a succession of civilian contractors, beginning with the Olympic Steamship Line and ending with Pope & Talbot, Inc. In September 1957, she was placed out of service and was berthed in Virginia's James River with the National Defense Reserve Fleet.
Conversion to missile tracker.
Late in 1962, she was turned over to the Navy Department for conversion to a missile range instrumentation ship. On 19 March 1963, she was renamed "Wheeling" and designated "AGM-8". On 28 May 1964, "Wheeling" was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service to be operated by a civil service crew in support of operations on the Navy's Pacific Missile Range. 
"Wheeling" spent her missile tracking years as a mobile tracking station, recording data on missiles and satellites that were out of range of land-based stations. For a number of years she remained on active service on the Pacific coast.
Inactivation and sinking.
"Wheeling" remained in service until (date unknown) and was struck from the Navy List on 31 October 1990. However, during a Naval exercise on 12 July 1981 she was assigned as target ship for Harpoon missile testing. She was struck by three Harpoons, two of which were launched by ship, one by submarine and one by air. Details of how and when the ship sank, or was otherwise disposed of, are lacking.

<doc id="18916161" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18916161" title="Igbo culture">
Igbo culture

Igbo culture () are the customs, practices and traditions of the Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria. It comprises archaic practices as well as new concepts added into the Igbo culture either by cultural evolution or by outside influence. These customs and traditions include the Igbo people's visual art, music and dance forms, as well as their attire, cuisine and language dialects. Because of their various subgroups, the variety of their culture is heightened further.
Music.
The Igbo people have a melodic and symphonic musical style, which they designed from forged iron. Other instruments include opi, a wind instrument similar to the flute, igba, and ichaka.
Another popular musical form among the Igbo is Highlife, which is a fusion of jazz and traditional music and widely popular in West Africa. The modern Ibo Highlife is seen in the works of Prince Nico Mbarga Dr Sir Warrior, Oliver De Coque, Bright Chimezie, and Chief Osita Osadebe, who are the some of the greatest Igbo Highlife Musicians of the twentieth century.
There are also other notable Highlife artists of igbo extract, like the Mike Ejeagha, Paulson Kalu, Ali Chukwuma, Ozoemena Nwa Nsugbe.
Art.
Igbo Art is known for various types of masquerade, masks and outfits symbolising people animals or abstract conceptions. Igbo art is also known for its bronze castings found in the town of Igbo Ukwu from the 9th century.
Igbo art is any body of visual art originating from the people of the Igbo.
Mythology.
While today many Igbo people are Christian, the traditional ancient Igbo religion is known as Odinani. In the Igbo mythology, which is part of their ancient religion, the supreme God is called Chukwu ("great spirit"); Chukwu created the world and everything in it and is associated with all things on Earth. Chukwu is also a solar deity. To the ancient Igbo, the Cosmo is divided into four complex parts:
Alusi.
Alusi, also known as Arusi or Arushi, are minor deities that are worshiped and served in Igbo mythology. There are a list of many different Alusi and each has its own purpose. When there is no longer need for the deity it is discarded.
Yam.
The yam is very important to the Igbo as it is their staple crop. There are celebrations such as the New yam festival () which are held for the harvesting of the yam.
The New Yam festival () is celebrated annually to secure a good harvest of the staple crop. The festival is practiced primarily in Nigeria and other countries in West Africa.
Traditional attire.
Traditionally the attire of the Igbo generally consisted of little clothing as the purpose of clothing then was to conceal private parts, although elders were fully clothed. Children were usually nude from birth till their adolescence (the time when they were considered to have something to hide) but sometimes ornaments such as beads were worn around the waist for medical reasons. Uli body art was also used to decorate both men and women in the form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body.
With colonialism and the Westernization of Igbo culture, Western styled clothes such as shirts and trousers over took traditional clothing.
Females.
Women carried their babies on their backs with a strip of clothing binding the two with a knot at her chest. This baby carrying technique was and still is practiced by many people groups across Africa along with the Igbo who still carry their babies this way. This method has been modernized in the form of the child carrier. In most cases Igbo women did not cover their chest areas. Maidens usually wore a short wrapper with beads around their waist with other ornaments such as necklaces and beads. Both men and women wore wrappers.
Males.
Males would wear loin cloths that wrapped around their waist and between their legs to be fastened at their back, the type of clothing appropriate for the intense heat as well as jobs such as farming. Men could also tie a wrapper over their loin cloth.
Modern traditional attire.
Modern Igbo traditional attire is generally made up, for men, of the Isiagu top which resembles the African Dashiki. Isiagu (or "Ishi agu") is usually patterned with lions heads embroidered over the clothing, It can also be plain, (usually black). It is worn with trousers and can be worn with either a traditional title holders hat (a fez named okpu agu or agwu), or with the traditional Igbo stripped men's hat (which resembles the Bobble hat). For women, an embodied puffed sleeve blouse (influenced by European attire) along with two wrappers (usually modern "Hollandis" material) and a head scarf are worn.
Chieftaincy Title.
Highly accomplished men and women are admitted into orders for people of title such as Ndi Ozo or Ndi Nze. Such individuals receive certain insignia to show their stature. Membership in these orders is highly exclusive, and to qualify an individual needs more than mere material accomplishment or gallantry. They need to be highly regarded and well-spoken of in the community, and most importantly, they must be a person of the greatest integrity, truthfulness and sanity. The slightest impeachment of character is enough to disqualify an individual from becoming a person of title and once admitted into the order, a person of title is forbidden to lie, cheat, climb a tree, covet or strip their neighbor of their belongings, or commit an abomination of a crime. In modern times unfortunately money can buy chieftancy titles in Igbo communities and character is often overlooked.
Apprenticeship.
The Igbo have a unique form of apprenticeship in which either a male family member or a community member will spend time (usually in their teens to their adulthood) with another family, when they work for them. After the time spent with the family, the head of the host household, who is usually the older man who brought the apprentice into his household, will establish () the apprentice by either setting up a business for him or giving money or tools by which to make a living.
This practice was exploited by Europeans, who used this practice as a way of trading in enslaved people. Olaudah Equiano, although stolen from his home, was an Igbo person who was forced into slavery to an African family. He said that fell part of the family, unlike later, when he was shipped to North America and enslaved in the Thirteen Colonies.
Osu caste system.
Osu are a group of people whose ancestors were dedicated to serving in shrines and temples for the deities of the Igbo, and therefore were deemed property of the gods. Relationships and sometimes interactions with Osu were (and to this day, still are) in many cases, forbidden.
To this day being called an "Osu" remains a stigma that prevents people's progress and lifestyles.
Calendar (Iguafo Igbo).
In the traditional Igbo calendar, a week () has 4 days () ("Eke", "Orie", "Afọ", "Nkwọ"), seven weeks make one month (), a month has 28 days and there are 13 months in a year. In the last month, an extra day is added. The names of the days have their roots in the mythology of the Kingdom of Nri. It was believed that Eri, the sky-born founder of the Nri kingdom, had gone on a journey to discover the mystery of time. On his journey he had saluted and counted the four days by the names of the spirits that governed them, and so the names of the spirits ("eke", "orie", "afọ" and "Nkwo") became the days of the week.
An example of a month: Ọnwa Mbụ
Naming after market days.
Newborn babies were sometimes named after the day of the week when born. This is no longer the fashion. Names such as "Mgbeke" (maiden on the day of Eke), Mgborie (maiden [born on the Orie day) are commonly seen among the Igbo people. For males, "Mgbe" is replaced by "Nwa" or "Okoro" (Igbo: Child ). Examples of this are Solomon Okoronkwo and Nwankwo Kanu, two popular footballers.
Igbo masks and masquerades.
There are two basic types of masquerades, visible and invisible. The visible masquerades are meant for the public. They often are more entertaining. Masks used offer a visually appeal for their shapes and forms. In these visual masquerades, performances of harassment, music, dance, and parodies are acted out (Oyeneke 25).
The invisible masquerades take place at night. Sound is the main tool for them. The masquerader uses his voice to scream so it may be heard throughout the village. The masks used are usually fierce looking and their interpretation is only fully understood by the society’s members. These invisible masquerades call upon a silent village to strike fear in the hearts of those not initiated into their society.
Kola nut (Ọjị).
Kola nut () occupies a unique position in the cultural life of Igbo people. Ọjị is the first thing served to any visitor in an Igbo home. Ọjị is served before an important function begins, be it marriage ceremony, settlement of family disputes or entering into any type of agreement. Ọjị is traditionally broken into pieces by hand, and if the Kola nut breaks into 3 pieces a special celebration is arranged.

Joseph McGahn

Dr. Joseph Leo McGahn (c. 1917 – December 24, 1999) was an American obstetrician and Democratic Party politician from New Jersey who served for six years in the New Jersey Senate from 1972 to 1978, where he was a key figure in bringing casino gambling to Atlantic City.
Education and medical career.
McGahn was born in Atlantic City. He attended St. Mary's College of Maryland, graduating summa cum laude in 1939 and was awarded his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1943 from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. After graduating from medical school, he served as a general surgeon in the United States Army Medical Corps during World War II.
After returning from military service, he practiced internal medicine and surgery in Atlantic City. Starting in 1951, he began a specialty in obstetrics and gynecology.
Legislative career.
McGahn served on the Absecon, New Jersey City Council and as its mayor. He won the Democratic primary for State Senate in 1971 in the district, in which registered Republican Party heavily outnumbered Democrats, and ran for office without the support of the local Democratic Party leadership. On Election Day, November 3, 1971, McGahn defeated incumbent Frank S. Farley, who had served a total of 34 years in the New Jersey Legislature, to win a seat in the New Jersey Senate, in a race in which McGahn focused on corruption, in the wake of federal investigation of the Republican Party machine in Atlantic City. 
Shortly after taking office, McGahn was the cosponsor of a bill to bring casino gambling to New Jersey. He was described by "The New York Times" as the "principal architect" of legislation that brought casino gambling to Atlantic City. He also pushed for the creation of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, considered the most rigorous casino enforcement agency at the time.
He ran for office again in 1973, again winning without support of the Democratic establishment. While in the Senate, he served as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Energy and the Environment.
In 1974, McGahn pushed for legislation granting exemptions to healthcare institutions from a requirement to provide abortions or sterilizations if they objected on religious or moral grounds. The bill passed the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Brendan Byrne despite his feelings that the legislation "may have gone too far,"
Party leadership at the Democratic convention in 1977 roundly supported Steven P. Perskie, a Democratic member of the New Jersey General Assembly, by a margin of 266 to 77. McGahn ran in the general election as an independent, with Perskie beating both McGahn and Republican candidate Frederick Perone. Both McGahn and Perskie had won election to the Legislature in 1971, despite the Republicans 4-1 edge in registration.
In 1981, McGahn ran for and won the Republican primary, and again challenged Perskie in the general election. Perskie won reelection with 29,151 votes, defeating McGahn, who received 28,149.
After the legislature.
Both before and after his service in the legislature, he worked at the Atlantic City Medical Center, specializing in emergency medicine. From 1984 to 1989, he became medical director at Resorts International.
On September 27, 1995, the South Jersey Transportation Authority named the bridge connecting the Atlantic City Expressway with local Atlantic City streets in honor of McGahn.
McGahn had been a longtime resident of Absecon, New Jersey. He died on December 24, 1999 at Meadowview Nursing Home in Northfield, New Jersey.

In 2009, American Samoa was connected to the Internet using the ASH undersea cable that increased bandwidth from 20 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s. The project used a defunct PacRim East cable built in 1993 that previously connected Hawaii with New Zealand.

Criticism.
Despite the millions of dollars that governor Togiola Tulafono spent into bringing fiber optic to American Samoa, the Internet is still as slow before. The two Internet service providers that anyone on the island is actually familiar with offer the same speed at the same prices. Before fiber optic, one can see speeds up to 256k for the public while paying $75. After fiber optic, the latency may have changed but not the pricing/speed scheme which stayed at around 256k/$75.
American Samoa has the most expensive internet in America according to Engadget.

Peyresq

Peyresq (from "le pays des pierres", or "the land of stones") is a French village in the commune of Thorame-Haute in France, perched on a rocky outcrop of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence at 1,528 metres above sea level.
History.
The village first appears in charters of 1042 as "Petriscum", referring to its rocky surroundings.
Peyresq (then spelled Peiresc) gave its name to the famous humanist Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc - he was its lord, but never set foot there. After the French Revolution, the village came to be spelled as Peyresq, and in November 1964 it was merged with the village of La Colle-Saint-Michel to create a new commune called Saint-Michel-Peyresq. That commune was in turn absorbed by the municipality of Thorame-Haute in March 1974.
Reconstruction and renaissance.
In 1952, Georges Lambeau, director of the Académie des Beaux-Arts at Namur, was searching the region for a site for a holiday camp for his students and found Peyresq almost completely abandoned and almost all its houses in ruins. Falling in love with the village's charm, he decided to reconstruct it in his own image. His friend Toine Smets, an entrepreneur from Brussels, decided to finance the project. According to the historian Louise Sgaravizzi, in 1953 of 53 houses 24% were habitable, 40% needed restoration and 16% were in ruins (the majority on what is now called the cour des Métiers). The access route to the village was paved in 1953. In 1954, the last farmer stopped farming in the fields at the foot of the village.
In 1954, the young architect Pierre Lamby joined the project. At the same time, Toine Smets revealed Peyresq to Lucien and Jane Jacquet, who founded the association Pro Peyresq, soon joined by Jacques Waefelaer and his wife Jacqueline, respectively treasurer and "responsable de l'intendance" (économat).

List of former U.S. National Forests

This is a list of all the former National Forests in the United States. These units were renamed, disestablished, combined with other units or split apart during reorganizations of the U.S. Forest Service system. There was particular turnover during the first decade of the 20th century, when the forest system was reorganized several times, most notably on July 1, 1908. Many smaller holdings of fewer than were combined. In the 1920s a short-lived program created several National Forests from excess portions of military facilities. Within two years these transfers were reconsidered and rescinded.

<doc id="18916264" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18916264" title="Loss ratio">
Loss ratio

A loss ratio is a ratio of losses to gains, used normally in a financial context. It is the opposite of the gross profit ratio (commonly known as the "gross profit margin").
For insurance, the loss ratio is the ratio of total losses incurred (paid and reserved) in claims plus adjustment expenses divided by the total premiums earned. For example, if an insurance company pays $60 in claims for every $100 in collected premiums, then its loss ratio is 60% with a profit ratio/margin of 40% or $40.
Loss ratios for property and casualty insurance (e.g. motor car insurance), range typically from 40% to 60%. Such companies are collecting premiums more than the amount paid in claims. Conversely, insurers that consistently experience high loss ratios may be in bad financial health. They may not be collecting enough premium to pay claims, expenses, and still make a reasonable profit.
The terms "permissible", "target", "balance point", or "expected" loss ratio are used interchangeably to refer to the loss ratio necessary to fulfill the insurer's profitability goal. This ratio is 1 minus the expense ratio, where the expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, commissions and advertising expenses, profit and contingencies, and various other expenses. Expenses associated with insurance payouts ("losses") are sometimes considered as part of the loss ratio. When calculating a rate change, the insurer will typically divide the incurred or actual experienced loss ratio (AER) by the permissible loss ratio.
For banking, a loss ratio is the total amount of unrecoverable debt when compared to total outstanding debt. For example, if $100 was loaned, but only $90 was repaid, the bank has a loss ratio of 10%. These calculations are applied class-wide and used to determine financing fees for loans. If the average loss ratio on a class of loans is 2%, then the financing fees for loans of that class must be greater than 2% to recover the normal loss and return a profit.
Medical Loss Ratio.
In the late 1990s, loss ratios for health insurance (known as the SeymourDumore loss ratio, or SLR) ranged from 60% to 110% (40% profits to 10% losses). As of 2007, the average US medical loss ratio for private insurers was 81% (a 19% profit ratio).
In an amendment written by Senator Al Franken, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 now mandates minimum MLRs of 85% for the large group market and 80% for the individual and small group markets. Insurers that do not spend 80-85% of their premiums in health care costs must now issue rebates to consumers.

Havok (wargame)

Havok was a short-lived wargame created by Bluebird Toys in 1997. It was designed as a cheaper alternative to Warhammer 40,000 and was aimed at a younger audience. The key defining feature of Havok miniatures was the use of soft, flexible plastic in production, the hand pre-painted, pre-assembled models, 35mm plastic bases and decorative sticker for the models and bases, which meant that additional paints and glue was not necessary.
Havok shared many themes with Warhammer 40,000, including the Space-Marine-like Karn Empire, the Nexus Rebellion- who looked like Imperial Guard- and the Pteravore, whose main unit was similar to Tyranid Genestealers. The Karn and Nexus "Battleforms" where giant robots, a staple of miniature wargames of this genre. Giant robots called 'Dreadnoughts' also feature in Warhammer 40,000.
Initially, the game was sold in "Havok Skirmish Battle Sets", which included a small force with equal numbers of Karn and Nexus units. Soon after, expansion blisters were released that included extra units, many of which were not included in the Skirmish Box. However, due to being sold through a catalogue company (Argos), it became very difficult for collectors to acquire the units they wanted (see below).
The failure of the brand to take off has been attributed to a variety of factors, mainly associated with bad marketing. Considered the main contributing factor was the fact that Havok expansion blisters could only be bought as one item from a catalogue store, which meant that it was impossible for customers to purchase specific units, as all items had the same serial number and so were chosen randomly by the staff. Bluebird Toys also released too early for the Christmas Rush and the company went bankrupt before Christmas Day. A clunky and flawed rules system (which attempted to be simpler than Warhammer) also brought down the quality of the game down, and a few collectors have recently created updated rules based on Warhammer 40,000 rulebooks.
After the company went bankrupt, many toy stores sold the boxes at lower prices, but many collectors did not realise the company had stopped selling the products. Unopened Havok boxes are now very rare.
Units that are of particular collectors value are the Pteravore Hound, Pteravore Screamer and Karn Heavy Weapons, as these appear not to have released to stores in great numbers before Bluebird Toys went bankrupt and so only display models exist.

Gary Laffan

Gary Laffan (born 1975) is an Irish hurler is an Irish retired hurler who played as a full-forward for the Wexford senior hurling team. 
Laffan made his first appearance for the team during the 1994 Oireachtas Tournament and subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement prior to the 2002 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal and two Leinster medals.
At club level Laffan is a county football championship medalist with Glynn/Barntown.
Playing career.
Club.
Laffan plays his club hurling and football with Glynn/Barntown and has enjoyed some success.
After winning several championship medals in the under-21 hurling grade, Laffan subsequently became a dual player with the club's top sides. In 1996 he lined out in the senior football championship decider. A narrow defeat of Kilanerin gave Laffan a coveted championship medal.
Laffan has ended up as county hurling championship runner-up on three occasions.
Inter-county.
Laffan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a dual player with the Wexford under-21 teams.
He made his senior debut in an Oireachtas Tournament semi-final victory over Waterford in 1994. Laffan subsequently became a regular player during the following year's National Hurling League.
In 1996 Laffan lined out in his first provincial decider at senior level. Reigning champions Offaly provided the opposition and had held the upper-hand against Wexford in a series of games stretching back to 1979. On that day Wexford produced one of their best-ever displays and a 2-23 to 2-15 victory secured a coveted Leinster medal for Laffan. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Wexford against Limerick for the first time in over forty years. The game was far from a classic; however, it did provide excitement. Tom Dempsey was the hero of the day as he scored a goal after nineteen minutes to give Wexford a major advantage. His side led by 1-8 to 0-10 at half-time in spite of having Éamonn Scallan sent off. Wexford took a four-point lead in the second-half; however, this was whittled back to two points as Wexford hung on for the last twenty minutes. The final score of 1-13 to 0-14 secured the All-Ireland title for Wexford and a coveted medal for Laffan.
Laffan added a second Leinster medal to his collection in 1997 following a 2-14 to 1-11 defeat of Kilkenny.
The following few years saw a decline in form for Wexford and Laffan left the panel in 2002.
Managerial career.
Wexford.
In retirement from playing Laffan became involved in team management. In 2010 he joined Tony Dempsey's under-21 hurling management team as a selector. During his three seasons as a selector, Wexford made some progress. The team reached two provincial finals only to lose out on both occasions to Dublin.

Faculty of Law, Thammasat University

The Faculty of Law, Thammasat University (; ) is an administrative agency of the Thai Government, being an academic faculty attached to Thammasat University, Ministry of Education. It is the second oldest university faculty in the country, preceded only by the Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University. Also, it has long played a major role in the politics of Thailand and among its graduates counts many former prime ministers, ministers, senior government officers, judges, including Presidents of the Supreme Court of Justice, and other public figures.
History.
Thammasat University's Faculty of Law dates from the initiation of the Law School in 1907 by Prince Raphi Phatthanasak Krommaluang Ratchaburi Direk Rit, the western-educated Minister of Justice and a son of King Chulalongkorn. Classes were originally conducted at the luncheon lobby of the Prince's palace; he would give lectures there every afternoon. The Law School was soon moved to the central building of the Ministry of Justice due to the increasing number of students.
In 1910 Prince Rhapi resigned from the office of Minister of Justice and the Law School was first relocated to Wat Mahathat Yuwarat Rang Sarit, a royally sponsored Buddhist temple, and then to a small royal residence next to the Civil Court.
The following year, King Vajiravudh took the Law School under his patronage. By a royal command, the school became a subsidiary of the Ministry of Justice. The School was once again relocated to the former office of the Department of Public Relations, near Phan Phiphop Lila Bridge.
Following the successful coup d'état against King Prajadhipok, the government, on 25 April 1932, ordered a Faculty of Law and Public Administration to be established as part of Chulalongkorn University and the Law School to be transferred to the newly established faculty.
In the next year, Narisara Nuvadtivongs, the Regent for King Prajadhipok, signed the Moral and Political Science University Act, Buddhist Era 2476 (1933), which came into force on 20 March. Certain parts of the Act read:
An open admission university at the beginning, Thammasat offered only a "Bachelor of Jurisprudence" course.
14 June 1939, the Bachelor of Jurisprudence course was divided into four majors, organised into separate faculties: the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Public Administration, the Faculty of Economics and the Faculty of Commerce. The Bachelor of Jurisprudence course completely came to an end in 1953.
In 1969, the Faculty of Law organised an examination for lecturer selection for the first time, and started providing funds for developing its lecturers by sending them to study abroad, such as, the National Civil Service Commission Fund, the Oceanic and Suwannamat Fund, the French Government Fund, and the Ananda Mahidol Fund.
In 1971, credit system and new evaluation system (grade point average system) were used in the University for the first time. The Faculty of Law had improved its courses to be in compliance with the new systems, but retained its previous evaluation system (point average system) as a main system for education assessment until the present.
In 2006, the Thammasat University's Faculty of Law Council resolved to move all undergraduate courses, other than Summer courses, from Tha Phra Chan Campus in Bangkok to Rangsit Campus in Changwat Pathum Thani, where there had been hosted the 1998 Asian Games and the 2007 Summer Universiade.
In 2008, Lampang Campus of the University has been established. The University announced open the branch office of the Faculty of Law there, where the law courses began in the following year. The persons capable of becoming the students at this Campus are required to have completed secondary education and to be domiciled in the Northern Region of the country. The student admission system has also been dichotomised into the University's selection (Direct Admission System) and the Government's selection (Central Admission System). In each year, about 150 students will be selected out of those applied in the former system, and further 50, from the latter.
Administration.
Administers.
Note: Academic titles shown above are those at the time of assuming the dean's office, some of which might later be changed.
Academic Divisions.
Thammasat University's Faculty of Law consists of the following academic divisions:
Courses.
Undergraduate Courses.
Each year, the Faculty has an intake of about 600–700 undergraduate students contemplating the 4-year LL.B. programme, with a total students of almost 2,000–3,000 students for the whole four years. Holders of a non-law degree may also enroll in the evening LL.B. Programme, the length of which is shorted to three years, with approximately 500–600 students for each year.
Staffed by over 100 well-qualified teaching members with overseas experience from various jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France, Germany, Italy, Australia and Japan and so forth, the Faculty has maintained its recognised status as the best law school of the Country.
Teaching law at this law school is distinct. Not only provisions of law are taught. Students are introduced philosophical foundations underlying "black letters" of the codes or legislation and are encouraged to discuss, articulate legal reasoning, advance arguments and think of "the law that ought to be" in tandem with "the law that is". Altruistic attitudes and social responsibilities are instilled, all along the line of the "social dedication" spirit adhered to by the University since its inauguration in 1934. Remarkably, the Faculty has thus far produced holders of significant offices of the country.
Graduate Courses.
At the graduate level, teaching is based upon a comparative approach and intended to encourage critical thinking and insights into legal problems in both theoretical and practical dimensions. Those leaving the undegraduate law courses therefrom are expected to become legal scholars, legal thinkers, experts or practitioners in particular areas of law. Indeed, under the LL.M. programme, in an attempt to promote expertise in specific areas, 8 fields of study are offered: Private Law, Criminal Law, Business Law, International Law, International Trade Law, Tax Law, Public Law, and Environmental Law.
The programme has an annual intake of about 200–300 students. Students attend classes in the evenings and may now complete their courses of study and a thesis (or an independent study on a selected topic) in 5 terms (2.5 years). The Faculty of Law plans to operate an English-Language LL.M. Programme in Business Law in 2009.
With the well-known expertise in public law, the Faculty also offers the 1-year Graduate Diploma Programme in Public Law, mostly enrolled by Government and State officials, with an annual intake of up to 100 students. A certain limit of credits earned from this Diploma Programme may be transferred towards the LL.M. Programme. Further, the Faculty also offers the Graduate Diploma Programme in Business Law which provides intended fields of concentration e.g. "Intellectual Property" or "Risk Management and Insurance".
At the doctoral level, the Faculty welcomes candidates with excellent legal knowledge. Admission is granted mainly through an English test as well as a qualifying examination on the result of preliminary study on a selected topic. This uppermost programme is mainly based upon independent research, although attendance at the Legal Methodology Class is compulsory.
Prominent Activities.
Day Commemorating Prince Raphi.
In every August, the Faculty annually organises an Exhibition of the Day Commemorating Prince Raphi. The activities in which consists of: laying wreath before the Prince's Statue at the Supreme Court of Justice as a homage to the Prince, Buddhist ceremonies, academic forums on various topics which are usually concerning the ongoing political and social events in the country, legal clinic "sans frais", academic competitions, moot court. etc.
Each year, four male and another four female students of the Faculty will be elected by all students to become the Exhibition ambassadors carrying out public relations campaigns as to the Exhibition and laying wreaths of homage.

Pre-Columbian Belize

The Pre-Columbian Belize history is the period from initial indigenous presence, across millennia, to the first contacts with Europeans - the Pre-Columbian or "before Columbus" period - that occurred on the region of the Yucatán Peninsula that is present day Belize.
Belize's history begins with the Paleo-Indians. They were nomadic people that arrived in the Asia to the Americas migration across the frozen Bering Strait, perhaps as early as 35,000 years ago. In the course of many millennia, their descendants settled in and adapted to different environments in the Americas, creating many cultures in North America, Central America, and South America. The Mayan culture emerged in the lowland area of the Yucatán Peninsula and the highlands to the south, in what is now southeastern Mexico, Guatemala, western Honduras, and Belize. Many aspects of this culture persist in the area despite nearly half a millennium of European domination. All evidence, whether from archaeology, history, ethnography, or linguistic studies, points to a cultural continuity in this region. The descendants of the first settlers in the area have lived there for at least three millennia.
Paleo-Indian and Archaic periods (c. 35,000—2,500 BC).
Prior to about 2500 BC, some hunting and foraging bands settled in small farming villages. While hunting and foraging continued to play a part in their subsistence, these farmers domesticated crops such as corn, beans, squash, and chili peppers, which are still the basic foods in Central America. A profusion of languages and subcultures developed within the Mayan core culture. Between about 2500 BC and AD 250, the basic institutions of Mayan civilization emerged. The peak of this civilization occurred during the Classic Period, which began about AD 250.
Farmers engaged in various types of agriculture, including labor-intensive irrigated and ridged-field systems and shifting slash-and-burn agriculture. Their products fed the civilization's craft specialists, merchants, warriors, and priest-astronomers, who coordinated agricultural and other seasonal activities with a cycle of rituals in ceremonial centers. These priests, who observed the movements of the sun, moon, planets, and stars, developed a complex mathematical and calendrical system to coordinate various cycles of time and to record specific events on carved stelae.
Maya civilization.
Preclassic period (c. 2500 BC—250 AD).
At the Cuello site, from perhaps as early as 2500 BC., jars, bowls, and other dishes found there are among the oldest pottery unearthed in present-day Mexico and Central America. The site, five kilometers west of Orange Walk, includes platforms of buildings arranged around a small plaza, indicating a distinctly Mayan community. The presence of shell, hematite, and jade shows that the Maya were trading over long distances as early as 1500 BC. The Mayan economy, however, was still basically subsistence, combining foraging and cultivation, hunting, and fishing.
Cerros, a site on Chetumal Bay, was a flourishing trade and ceremonial center between about 300 BC and AD 100. It displays some distinguishing features of early Mayan civilization. The architecture of Mayan civilization included temples and palatial residences organized in groups around plazas. These structures were built of cut stone, covered with stucco, and elaborately decorated and painted. Stylized carvings and paintings of people, animals, and gods, along with sculptured stelae and geometric patterns on buildings, constitute a highly developed style of art. Impressive two-meter-high masks decorate the temple platform at Cerros. These masks, situated on either side of the central stairway, represent a serpent god.
Classic period (c. 250—900 AD).
Altún Ha.
The Maya were skilled at making pottery, carving jade, knapping flint, and making elaborate costumes of feathers. One of the largest carved jade objects of Mayan civilization was found in a tomb at the classic period site of Altún Ha, thirty kilometers northwest of present-day Belize City. Usually stated to be the head of the sun god, Kinich Ahau, it is actually quite unlike this deity, save for the square and squinting eyes. Settled at least as early as 200 BC, the Altún Ha area at its peak had an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 inhabitants. At the beginning of the second century AD, the inhabitants built their first major structure, a temple. The visitor today sees a group of temples, priests' residences, and other buildings around two adjacent plazas. In the vicinity, there are hundreds of other structures, most of which are still unexcavated. The Maya continued to rebuild some of the temples until almost the end of the ninth century. Excavations at Altún Ha have produced evidence suggesting that a revolt, perhaps of peasants against the priestly class, contributed to the downfall of the civilization. People may have continued to live at or to visit the site in the postclassic period, even though the ceremonial centers were left to decay. Some rubbish found at Altún Ha shows that people were at the site in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, perhaps to reuse the old structures or undertake pilgrimages to the old religious center.
The recorded history of the center and south is dominated by Caracol, where the inscriptions on their monuments was, as elsewhere, in the Lowland Maya aristocratic tongue Classic Ch'olti'an. North of the Maya Mountains, the inscriptional language at Lamanai on Hill Bank Lagoon in Orange Walk District was Yucatecan as of 625 CE. Other Mayan centers located in Belize include Xunantunich and Baking Pot in Cayo District, Lubaantún and Nimli Punit in Toledo District.
Xunantunich.
Xunantunich, meaning "Lady of the Rock," was occupied perhaps as early as 300 BC, but most of the architecture there was constructed in the late classic period. As in all the lowland Mayan centers, the inhabitants continually constructed temples and residences over older buildings, enlarging and raising the platforms and structures in the process. The views are breathtaking from Xunantunich's "El Castillo," which, at thirty-nine meters, is the tallest man-made structure in Belize.
Lamanai, less accessible to tourists than Altún Ha or Xunantunich, is an important site because it provides archaeological evidence of the Mayan presence over many centuries, beginning around AD 150. Substantial populations were present throughout the classic and postclassic periods. Indeed, people living in the area were still refacing some of the massive ceremonial buildings after the great centers, such as Tikal in neighboring Guatemala, had been virtually abandoned in the tenth century.
Late classic period.
In the late classic period, probably at least 400,000 people inhabited the Belize area. People settled almost every part of the country worth cultivating, as well as the cay and coastal swamp regions.
Postclassic period (c. 10th—early 16th century).
In the tenth century, Mayan society suffered a severe breakdown. Construction of public buildings ceased, the administrative centers lost power, and the population declined as social and economic systems lost their coherence. Some people continued to occupy, or perhaps reoccupied, sites such as Altún Ha, Xunantunich, and Lamanai. Still, these sites ceased being splendid ceremonial and civic centers.
The decline of Mayan civilization is still not fully explained. Rather than identifying the collapse as the result of a single factor, many archaeologists now believe that the decline of the Maya was a result of many complex factors and that the decline occurred at different times in different regions.
Increasing information about Mayan culture and society helps explain the development, achievements, and decline of their ancient civilization and suggests more continuities in Mayan history than once had been considered possible.

1971–72 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1971–72 campaign was Town's last season in the Football League's top division. They finished bottom of the table with only 25 points, the same as Nottingham Forest. Town won only 6 matches in the league all season and did not win any games from December to the end of the season. The only bright spark came in the FA Cup campaign which saw Town reach the 6th round, before losing to Birmingham City. Town only scored 6 goals in 1972 and 2 of those were own goals. This would be the start of Town's slump which would see Town relegated to Division 4 in 1975 .
Review.
Following their first season back in Division 1 for 15 years, Town were hoping to try to reach the summit of English football. This season would be one of Town's worst in their history. Town were bottom of the table all season, with the exception of a small period in September. They had a run of 4 wins in 5 during that time including a 2–1 win over rivals Leeds United. Interestingly, Town's last league win on November 27 was a 2–1 win over Derby County, who would become champions at the end of the season.
Town never won another league game until the next season, but they put on an inspired run in the FA Cup. After beating Division 2 sides Burnley and Fulham, Town hosted West Ham United and put on a thrilling display culminating in a 4–2 win over the Hammers. They then lost to Birmingham City in the 6th round and were then promptly relegated to Division 2 with 25 points, the same as Nottingham Forest. This is also currently the last season that Town have been in the top flight.

Newbridge Inn

The Newbridge Inn is a public house in Newbridge, a suburban village to the west of Edinburgh, Scotland. The inn was founded in 1683. The present building is dated 1895 and is a category C(S) listed building. It is located at the corner of Old Liston Road and Bridge Street, which was formerly the main route from Edinburgh to Glasgow.
Proprietors.
The Newbridge Inn was built in 1683 on land owned by Archibald Hope of Raukellour. On 12 December 1700 he sold some of the land, including the Inn, to John Dundas for "20 merks Scots money, 2 lambs, to be given on Whitsunday and Marksmas and 6 good hens yearly on Whitsunday”. On 16 July 1726 John Dundas sold the land and the Inn to James Liston for the sum of £385.15.6d. On 6 April 6 1737 Liston sold it to Patrick Hay for “a certain sum of money as the agreed and adequate price and hold me well content and satisfied and paid”. In 1759 on 22 August, Patrick Hay sold the land and the Inn to George Reid, a brewer and farmer, for £200.0.0d. George in turn willed it to his son Cumberland Reid on 14 June 1815 and in 1818, Cumberland left it to his nephew, John Reid, a merchant from Leith. John sold it to his brother James for sum of £700.0.0d on 27 August 1821. On 25 March 1824 James Reid sold only the Inn to Helen Cowie Buchanan for £465.0.0d. After 62 years, Helen sold on to Robert Gordon on 15 May 1866 for £725.0.0d. Robert Gordon took a loss and sold it on to John Aitkinson for £665.0.0d. On 3 July 1877 it was sold yet again for £300.0.0d to James Masterton. After his death the inn passed to his wife Christina Garlick Masterton who gifted it to her younger son, John Masterton. John sold it on to his brother James Masterton for £250.0.0d in 1898. In 1930, James Masterton Jnr willed it to his nephew, James Yule Wemyss in 1952. When James died, his wife Pleasance Cecilly Wemyss took over the running of the Inn in 1963. After 106 years and four generations in the same family, the Newbridge Inn was sold to David and June Morris on 28 June 1983.

Nuova Camorra Organizzata

The Nuova Camorra Organizzata (Italian: New Organized Camorra) was an Italian Camorra criminal organization founded in the late 1970s by a Neapolitan Camorrista, Raffaele Cutolo, in the region of Campania. It was also known by the initials NCO. The organization was established with the purpose of renewing the old rural Camorra, which dealt in contraband cigarettes and extortion schemes in the Neapolitan fruit market. To this end, Cutolo created a structured and hierarchical organization, in stark contrast to the traditional Camorra clans which are usually fragmented. The members of the NCO were often referred to by rival Camorristi and Italian law enforcement as ""Cutoliani"".
According to the Italian Justice Department, by 1981 the NCO had become the strongest Camorra clan and one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the nation, providing a living for at least 200,000 people in the Neapolitan area alone. It was distinctly hostile to the Sicilian Mafia, but had an alliance with numerous Calabrian 'Ndrangheta clans, in addition to the Nuova Grande Camorra Pugliese, which was the precursor to the Sacra Corona Unita in Apulia. 
It was eventually supplanted by the Nuova Famiglia, a confederation of clans consisting of Michele Zaza (a Camorra boss with strong ties with Cosa Nostra), the Gionta clan (from Torre Annunziata), the Nuvoletta clan from Marano, Antonio Bardellino from San Cipriano d'Aversa and Casal di Principe, the Alfieri clan of Saviano led by Carmine Alfieri, the Galasso clan of Poggiomarino (led by Pasquale Galasso), the Giuliano clan from Naples' quarter Forcella (led by Luigi Giuliano and the Vollaro clan from Portici (led by Luigi Vollaro).
It was considered extinct in the late 1980s, when many of its bosses and members were killed or imprisoned. Cutolo's Camorra is described as the ""mass Camorra"" of unemployed youth specializing in protection rackets, while Carmine Alfieri's Camorra was seen as the ""political Camorra"" because of its ability to obtain public sector contracts through political contacts, and Lorenzo Nuvoletta's as the ""business Camorra"" reinvesting drug money into construction following the 1980 earthquake.
History.
Formation.
The founder of this organization, Raffaele Cutolo, also known as ""Il professore"" (the professor), was born on December 20, 1941, in Ottaviano, a village in the hinterland of Naples. At the age of 18, on February 24, 1963, he committed his first homicide and was subsequently convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, reduced to 24 years after appeal. He was sent to Poggioreale, Naples’ prison. Entering the prison world on a murder conviction made Cutolo a ""tough guy"" 
In prison Cutolo learned the rules of the criminal world: he became a man of honour, paid respect to more powerful inmates, and started gathering personal prestige because of his striking personality. He never lost sight of his ambition and his desire to become one of the biggest bosses of the Neapolitan underworld. 
Cutolo had established himself as a ringleader, when Antonio Spavone aka ""'o Malommo"" (The Badman), was transferred to Poggioreale prison. He challenged Spavone to a knife fight in the courtyard (a practise called "'o dichiaramento", the declaration), but Spavone refused. The challenged boss allegedly limited himself to a reply: ""Today's young men want to die young by whatever means."" Spavone was released from prison shortly after this event. From his prison cell, Cutolo ordered the murder of Spavone. A hitman, allegedly Cutolo's friend, shot him in the face from short range with a shotgun. Spavone survived the ambush, but the shotgun blast left considerable damage to his facial structure, which required plastic surgery. Spavone immediately resigned from his highly visible role as a Camorra boss.
It was from within Naples' Poggioreale prison that Cutolo built the NCO. He began by befriending young inmates unfamiliar with jail, giving them a sense of identity and worth, so much so that when they were released they would send Cutolo ""flowers"" (i.e. money), which enabled him to increase his network. He helped poorer prisoners by buying food for them from the jail store, or arranging for food to be sent in from outside. In such ways, Cutolo created many ‘debts’ or ""rain cheques"" which he would cash at the opportune moment. As his following grew, he also began to exercise a monopoly of violence within a number of prisons, thus increasing his power. By the early 1970s, Cutolo had become so powerful that he was able to decide which of his followers would be moved to which jails, use a prison governor's telephone to make calls anywhere in the world, and allegedly even slap the prison governor on one occasion for daring to search his cell. Another key bond Cutolo created was regular payments to the families of NCO members sent to prison, thereby guaranteeing the allegiance of both prisoners and their families.
Cutolo was soon able to gather under him a small group of prisoners, the nucleus of which would later become the leadership of the NCO. They were Antonino Cuomo aka ""'o Maranghiello"" (The Cudgel), Pasquale Barra aka ""'o Nimale"" (The Animal), Giuseppe Puca aka ""'o Giappone"" (Japanese), Pasquale D'Amico aka ""'o Cartunaro"" (The Cardboard picker) and Vincenzo Casillo aka ""'o Nirone"" (The Big Black). After being released, they would set up the first criminal activities on the outside which would be directly controlled by Cutolo from within the penitentiary system.
Structure.
The NCO developed two parallel structures, one inside the penitentiary system called ""cielo coperto"" (covered sky), and the other outside the penitentiary system called ""cielo scoperto"" (clear sky). Since Cutolo and many NCO members were serving life sentences, communication between these two structures were of utmost importance. To retain his leadership, Cutolo needed to relay his orders to NCO members outside in an effective and reliable way, while simultaneously insuring that some of the profits generated by the expansion be delivered to prisons so that he could expand his recruitment drive.
The peculiar conditions at Poggioreale prison which included its strategic location in the centre of Naples Western District and continuous flow of people such as parole violators and relatives of prisoners, to and from the prison made it possible for the NCO to successfully coordinate criminal activities from their centralized location. The NCO used this continuous flow to bring money and goods to prison and to send directives to their associates for outside operations. The relatives who could visit daily were being used as primary couriers, but when they were unavailable, some of these associates would be certified on paper as kin through the courtesy of obliging clerks from various municipalities in the area, especially Cutolo's municipality in Ottaviano.
As the Justice Department discovered in 1983, Cutolo was visited daily from July 1977 to December 1978 by Giuseppe Puca who had a document from Ottaviano's municipality certifying him to be Cutolo's first cousin. He had also received three visits from another NCO member, Giuseppe Romano, one as Cutolo's brother-in-law, one as "compare" and finally as first cousin. The NCO became the organizing principle of a new kinship system based on "Comparaggio", first cousins and allied kin, which was formally written into the municipal registry by obliging local bureaucrats.
Once the first NCO group became operative and started generating profits, Cutolo established the "soccorso verde" (green cross) to help the NCO recruit new members from the prison population, providing them with clothes, lawyers, legal advice, money for themselves and their families, and even luxury items. There was a regular procedure for this financial allocation to prisoners. From the very beginning, Cutolo had his men set aside 500,000 lire from each successful operation in a fund for the prison population. This fund was distributed to inmates belonging to the NCO all over Italy through wire service by Raffaele's sister Rosetta Cutolo and some NCO lieutenants.
In an attempt to control the entire region, the NCO surpassed the family structure of the urban Camorra. The NCO was an open structure with new members incorporated at a rate of 1,000 per year. Membership was open to everyone, the primary requisites being swearing loyalty to Cutolo and contributing to the common criminal activities. However, as soon as the organization's business expanded and there was a need for more manpower, recruitment became more aggressive and later, even mandatory. In prison, people were forced to become members of the NCO. Failure to do so would often result in the murder of the unwilling prisoner.
The organization was a federation of different gangs, with their own territorial areas of action, but hierarchically ordered and tightly controlled by Raffaele Cutolo. A document found on pentito, Pasquale D'Amico, described the organization as a ""Door-to-door sales business, specializing in underwear and lingerie"." Cutolo was the CEO. There was a vice-chief executive at large (Vincenzo Casillo replacing Cutolo for emergency decisions, since Cutolo's reacton time was delayed by his imprisonment), an executive board (on which sat the members of the original group), then area managers, branch managers, and finally, salesmen in charge of collecting the weekly money from their rackets. Outside of prison, there was an executive meeting every fifteen days, where Rosetta Cutolo, who as the boss's sister, could easily communicate with him in prison.
Ideology.
What is unusual about Cutolo is that he has a kind of ideology, another factor that appealed to rootless and badly educated youths. He founded the NCO in his home town Ottaviano on October 24, 1970, the day of Cutolo’s patron saint, San Raffaele, and the organization used a statute of rules and regulations that were deliberately meant to have a striking resemblance to the Camorra of the last century. In such a way, Cutolo created the most powerful organization ever to exist in the Neapolitan hinterland. Using his personal appeal and almost magic charisma, he was able to achieve this single-handedly. 
The NCO strongholds were the towns to the east of Naples, such as Ottaviano. From its start, the NCO advocated using illegal resources available in the territory for the betterment of the community, claimed the role of protector of the community and assumed a strong regional identity based on criminal values. He accused the Sicilian Mafia of wanting to colonize Naples and the Campania. Cutolo appealed to a Campanian rather than Neapolitan sense of identity, perhaps as a result of his poor peasant background. 
For instance, Cutolo is once reported as having said: ""The day when the people of Campania understand that it is better to eat a slice of bread as a free man than to eat a stake as a slave is the day when Campania will win."". He talked about the need to re-establish respect for the people of this region: ""We have to renew the ancient splendors of Naples and the Campania. We have to give back its destiny to our region, represented by the symbol of Vesuvio.
It was this approach that made the NCO openly hostile to the Sicilian Mafia and other Camorra clans, and Cutolo consequently developed a long-standing alliance with the 'Ndrangheta, who had no intentions or designs in either Naples or Campania. Cutolo had strong ties with the 'Ndrangheta. According to some pentiti, Cutolo’s career started with is affiliation with the 'Ndrangheta, supported by important bosses such as Giuseppe Piromalli, Paolo De Stefano, and Mammoliti. Cutolo based his organisation of the NCO on the model of the 'Ndrangheta, its internal codes and rituals. 
The organisation was unique in the history of the Camorra in that it was highly centralised and possessed a rudimentary form of ideology. For example, he publicly declared that children were not to be kidnapped or mistreated and allegedly arranged the assassination of at least one kidnapper. Perhaps the most potent ideological weapon was the cult of violence, which sometimes bordered on a kind of death wish, as Cutolo once wrote: ""the value of a life doesn’t consist of its length but in the use made of it; often people live a long time without living very much. Consider this, my friends, as long as you are on this earth everything depends on your will-power, not on the number of years you have lived.""
Through his book of thoughts and poems, "Poesie e pensieri" and his many interviews with journalists, Cutolo was able to create a strong sense of identity amongst his members. The book was published in Naples in 1980, but never distributed to the public. The book, containing 235 pages of poems and pictures, was seized by the police and censored as an ""apology of a criminal organization."" According to the Justice department, this book was viewed by NCO members as the ""Bible of the NCO"" and was particularly popular in prison, due to Cutolo's own distribution by mail. Even though his book was impounded by magistrates within days of its publication, many prisoners, alienated from society both inside and outside jail, wrote to Cutolo and other NCO leaders asking for a copy. Its possession alone would later be considered incriminating evidence. 
Cutolo openly supported the young inmates, who were confronted with abuse, brutality, physical aggression and rape. He provided them with advice and protection from the brutalities of other inmates. At the same time they learned how to behave as a good "picciotto", the lowest entry level into the Camorra. Cutolo challenged the old Camorra bosses and gave the youngsters a structure to belong to: ""The new Camorra must have a statute, a structure, an oath, a complete ceremony, a ritual that must excite people to the point that they would risk their lives for this organization."" Cutolo was revered by his soldiers. They called him Prince and kissed his left hand as if he were a bishop.
Cutolo spent a great amount of time researching the 19th century Camorra and reconstructed the old Camorristic ritual of initiation. He took great care in making the ritual a binding social practise. In his cell, he created a cermeony in which the initiate received the award of the "primo regalo" (first gift) also called "abbraccio" (embrace) or "fiore" (flower). He infused the old Camorristic traditions with Catholicism and reconstituted the ritual of initiation of the traditional Camorra. 
The NCO has often been described as the ""expression of a kind of collective mass movement of the violent and disbanded youth of Campania"." However, an historian once declared the NCO to be just another ""gangsters association"" which had usurped the old and to some extent, respectful name of the Camorra. 
When the journalist Giorgio Rossi interviewed some of the young NCO members from Ottaviano, he recorded several testimonies of how willing were they to die for their boss and organization. One young picciotto said: ""You ask me why I do what I do. The answer is simple. I don't care if I die or live. Actually in a way I'm looking for my death."" A second picciotto said, ""We are running towards our death. There is no purpose to living here. This is a bad life. Life here counts zero. What I have seen in these 23 years is enough and I'm already dead. Now I'm living on borrowed time. If they want to kill me, fine, what I have seen is enough."" Similarly, a third one said, ""We are in such a state that if they try to step on us, we will kill. We are the living dead. I have already half a foot stepping on my head. If you step on me with the other half, I'll kill you.""
In a letter found by the local police, a young picciotto named Turisio Agrippino wrote to Salvatore Federico: ""The true god is our beloved Raffaele Cutolo."" Another young member of the NCO named Antonio Lucarelli aka ""'o Giarrone"" (The rascal) told a national television reporter in a televised interview from Cutolo's family courtyard that he was ready to give his life for Cutolo. Cutolo thanked him by having one of his men, Marco Medda, write him a letter which was later seized by the police: ""My dear Giarrone, your interview greatly flattered the professor; he is honored, in case of need, to accept the blood that from your noble vein will flow into his own. My dear Giarrone, you are a man of great quality."" Three months later, Lucarelli was killed during a clash with a rival gang.
Acquiring and consolidating power.
The NCO spread like wildfire in the crisis-ridden Campanian towns of the late 1970s, offering alienated youths an alternative to a lifetime of unemployment or poorly paid jobs. Hundreds of young men were employed as enforcers. Initially, the main specialisation of NCO gangs was extorting money through protection rackets from local businesses. The police calculated that the NCO had some 7000 armed associates in 1980. While the traditional Camorristic families held territorial powers and the consequent responsibility over their controlled areas, the NCO had no qualms over breaking the established social fabric by extorting shopkeepers, small factories and businesses, and building contractors. In its quest for cash, it even targeted individuals such as landlords, lawyers and professionals. The NCO's protection racket even included a transient circus. 
The NCO later branched out to cocaine trafficking, partly because it was less subject to police investigation than heroin, but also because the Sicilian Mafia was less involved in the cocaine trade. He also embarked on a ruthless campaign against the Sicilian Mafiosi operating in Campania. The years of the NCO's domination (1979–1983) saw the highest number of homicides, of which there were 900 in Campania alone.
At the end of the 1970s, two types of Camorra gangs began to take shape: the NCO type gangs led by Cutolo, which dealt mainly in Cocaine and protection rackets, preserving a strong regional sense of identity, and the business oriented gangs allied with the Mafia which were led by the likes of Michele Zaza, Carmine Alfieri, etc., who dealt in cigarettes and heroin, but soon moved on to invest in real estate and construction firms.
Cutolo’s NCO became more powerful by encroaching and taking over other group’s territories. The NCO was able to break the circle of traditional power held by the families. Cutolo’s organization was just too aggressive and violent to be resisted by any individual families. Other Camorra families initially were too weakened, too divided, and simply too intimidated by the NCO. Their territories were indefensible against an organization like the NCO, which raided and rules large areas, not by constant control, but by violence and quick action. Unlike the traditional Camorra clans which used slow and static methods of conducting their business, the gangs grouped inside the NCO displayed an open-ended dynamic force that depended on speed and movement. They usually came into the city from elsewhere, from the undifferentiated territories of the countryside; their men spread out across open space, relying on fast cars, motorcycles and mobile firepower instead of fortified positions.
The NCO even had an extraterritorial hit team composed of the most violent gang members from its various criminal gangs, who were ready to do the NCO's bidding by wreaking destruction and violence when required. It was a ten man team, capable of quick response to any emergency. It had some extremely powerful cars at its disposal which could cover the entire area of Naples in less than an hour. Its firing power was in the order of 10,000 bullets per minute.
Cutolo insisted that if other criminal groups wanted to keep their business, they had to pay the NCO protection on all their activities, including a percentage for each carton of cigarettes smuggled into Naples. This practice came to be known as ICA (Imposta Camorra Aggiunta – or Camorristic Sale Tax), mimicking the state VAT sale tax IVA (Imposta sul Valore Aggiunto). For instance, Michele Zaza, the biggest Neapolitan cigarette smuggler, was reported to have paid the NCO more than 4 billion lire in the first three months after the imposition of the racket.
Move into Apulia.
Raffaele Cutolo decided to expand the NCO to the neighboring region of Apulia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This was precipitated by a number of factors. 
Firstly, a number of Camorristi had been incarcerated or forced to resettle in Apulia. In the 1970s, a large number of NCO members had been relocated from their prisons in Campania to the local Pugliese prisons resulting in massive prison overcrowding. Furthermore, by the early 1980s a new smuggling route from Yugoslavia had been opened, and Apulia became a crucial juncture of this trade. Apulia's geographical features were of great interest for possible exploitation of its strategic potential, since it had a particularly extensive coastal area, a territory which was conveniently linked to the main motorways of Central-Northern Italy, and several mid sized airports. 
The absence of any local criminal association made Apulia a natural place for border crossings by Camorra clans who had the opportunity to exploit a particularly lucrative market there, free from any threatening local competition. 
The NCO members soon attempted to install themselves at the highest levels of power inside the prison, harassing other prisoners (specifically with requests for money) as well as offering membership in their organization, a process called "legalizzazione" (legislation). After consulting with his nephew Stephen Cutolo, Raffaele decided to adopt a strategy of assimilation of the local criminals. He opened availability for membership in the NCO to the locals, and decided to intervene directly, promoting a series of meeting with the purpose of ""legalizing"" new bosses for Apulia. This process was called "capi-zona a cielo scoperto" (local outside bosses). 
To this end, Cutolo founded a separate branch of the NCO in Apulia called the "Nuova Grande Camorra Pugliese" (NGCP) in 1981, a formal organization particularly active in the area around Foggia, modeled after its parent organization in Campania, but with its own command hierarchy. It was headed by the brothers, Specidato and Gurrieri. The NGCP was created with the sole objective to unite all the groups in the region and constitute an autonomous, parallel organization with respect to the NCO, though still subject to it economically.
Initially, there were no problems between the native criminals and the NCO. Their working relationship continued for years with no undue interference. At first local criminals were managing the illegal trades while the NCO lent financial resources and support demanding 40% of all profits derived from illegal activities. The local criminals were involved only during particularly difficult operations, and then contacts were established directly with single individuals or small groups active for some time in smuggling which for strategic reasons was concentrated mainly in the Brindisi area. However, the final outcome was not what he had planned and this arrangement proved to be an unstable one.
Soon the local criminals tried to free themselves from the masters. Cutolo's relentless defeats in the wars against the Nuova Famiglia in Campania weakened the hegemony and prestige of the NCO which eventually collapsed in its entirety. Soon, this affiliation with the NCO was dissolved and replaced by a working relationship with the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, whose leaders did not demand a share of the illicit profits. On May 1, 1983, with the sponsorship of the 'Ndrangheta capobastone, Giuseppe Rogoli founded the Sacra Corona Unita in Bari prison, a new Mafia invoking the regional Pugliese identity against the intrusion of the foreign Neapolitans. The Sacra Corona Unita received its legitimacy from Rogoli's induction into the 'Ndrangheta by the Calabrian 'Ndranghetisti, Carmine Alvaro and Umberto Bellocco, who were incarcerated with him in Porto Azzurro.
Formation of Nuova Famiglia.
During the NCO’s highest point of expansion, Camorra boss, Michele Zaza had to pay Cutolo’s organisation US $400,000 for the right to carry on operating in contraband cigarettes. However, no hierarchy between Camorra gangs or stable spheres of influence had been created, and no gang leader was likely to agree to taking a back seat without making a fight of it. In 1978, Zaza formed a ‘honourable brotherhood’ (Onorata fratellanza) in an attempt to get the Mafia-aligned Camorra gangs to oppose Cutolo and his NCO, although without much success. 
In mid 1979, the NCO took on the Giuliano clan, which had traditionally controlled the Forcella, or ""Casbah"" area in the centre of Naples. Prior to this, the Giuliano clan had been in good terms with the NCO until the first half of 1979. The clan was also under such bad terms with Michele Zaza that it launched an attack against his nephew Pasquale in December 1979. Another Camorra clan leader named Luigi Vollaro aka ""'o Califfo"" (the Caliph) had first raised the idea of an anti-Cutolo alliance with the Giuliano clan boss, Luigi Giuliano in 1979, following Cutolo's demand to receive a cut from his illegal gambling centres and lottery system in his base of Portici. A provisional death squad was set up, which contributed to the dozens of gangland deaths that year. 
The breaking point was reached when the NCO tried to move into the Giuliano's stronghold of Forcella, Piazza Mercato and Via Duomo, in the centre of Naples. A few days before Christmas, 1980, two NCO members presented themselves at an unloading of contraband cigarettes at Santa Lucia and demanded immediate payment of $400,000 to their organization, as well as insisting on future payment of $25 for every crate of cigarettes brought ashore. They then proceeded to shoot and injure one of the Giuliano gang members unloading the cigarettes. On Christmas Eve, the gang's leader, Luigi Giuliano, was also wounded in an attack. 
The clash, which had occurred in a period of growing tension, led to the formation of the Nuova Famiglia (NF) to contrast Cutolo’s predominant NCO, consisting of Zaza, the Nuvoletta’s and Antonio Bardellino from Casal Di Principe (the so-called "Casalesi"). It was formed as a federation of Anti-Cutolo Camorra clans, and copied the organizational structure of the NCO. In stark contrast to the NCO's Campania-based model, the NF sought to impose a more traditional conduct based on the Sicilian code of conduct. The attacks continued through January 1981, until a summit meeting was called at the end of the month in a Roman hotel, under the mediation of Antonio Spavone. It was attended by the NF leaders and the NCO was represented by Rosetta Cutolo and Vincenzo Casillo. Representatives from the Sicilian Mafia were also present in the meeting.
1980 Camorra War.
A shaky peace was established, only to be broken on 14 February when, during the confusion provoked by a strong earth tremor, NCO members in Naples' Poggioreale prison killed three adversaries. A more serious incident occurred in May, when the NCO bombed houses in Portici owned by men working in the contraband cigarette trade for the Zaza brothers. This was soon followed by retaliatory acts from the rival Nuova Famiglia. The two men who had tried to encroach on the Zaza's patch were shot and a car bomb was planted outside Cutolo's family home in Ottaviano. 
From 1980-1983, a bloody war raged in and around Naples, which left several hundred dead and severely weakened the NCO. It had its root causes in two main events: the rapid growth of two distinct types of Camorra gangs and the profound political and financial instability created by the November 1980 earthquake. The war soon became a straightforward battle for power which was fueled by the billions pouring in from Rome for earthquake reconstruction. For instance, the highest number of deaths occurred in the 1981-82 period, when most of the reconstruction contracts were being assigned. The number of gangland murders soon grew to epic proportions. During this period, some Neapolitans would place illegal and macabre bets, in a system controlled by the Camorra itself, on whether there would be more gangland murders than days over the coming year. Between June 16 and June 19, 1983, police arrested a thousand members of the NCO.
The earthquake had a major impact on the criminal underworld. A lot of people lost their businesses and were left unemployed and destitute. Without any place to work at, these displaced persons particularly the young men, turned to the NF and NCO for work. During this time, the NCO was getting richer by infiltrating the network of earthquake relief agencies. It hoarded enormous quantities of relief funds and goods, and charged fees for protecting all businesses involved in earthquake re-construction.
In addition to the massive hoarding, the NF was also greatly benefited by deterritorialization of the Camorra underworld in Naples. The earthquake had totally destroyed all social control, due to the displacement of people, cafes, small businesses and the cordoning of social blocks. The anti-Cutolo clans began to restructure themselves on the model of the NCO. Lacking any territory, they came to depend on open space, swapping their fortified positions for fast cars, motorcycles and mobile firepower. In this way, the NF began using the NCO's own tactics against them, i.e., high visibility, speed and brutal violence. In an act reminiscent of both Italian neo-fascist and left-wing terrorist groups, they sent messages to the press signed, ""Nuclei Armati Anti-Cutoliani"" (Armed Nucleus Anti-Cutolo) or ""Giustizieri Campani"" (Avengers from Campania) complete with their new slogans "Let's slay the coto-lette (literally porkchops, a pun on Cutolo's name)" and "Fight back". The savage war caused great inconveniences on the lives of the Neaploitan citizens, such that even a normal stroll through downtown Naples could be a potentially hazardous and life-threatening situation.
This savage war caused in turn a greater attention from the Italian police organizations, pushing the Sicilian Mafia to accommodate an agreement between the two warring clans, favouring the Nuova Famiglia, which included a lot of former allies. Many high ranking Sicilian mafiosi such as Leoluca Bagarella, Bernardo Provenzano and Totò Riina repeatedly tried to eliminate Cutolo. The war left Cutolo more exposed in terms of notoriety. He had not expected such a strong backlash from his adversaries, and his strong hostility to the Sicilian Mafia gave them another tactical advantage, in that they were able to obtain assistance from the Mafia. 
The individual gangs of the NF alliance had the added advantage of being less notorious than Cutolo's NCO. The NF were initially less affected by police crackdowns and investigations and were therefore able to carry the attack to the NCO, although the NF had suffered its own massive crackdown in 1984.
Defeat of Cutolo.
In a one year period between 1983 and 1984, there were a series of arrests and massive crackdowns coordinated by Italian justice on the activities and rackets operated by the NCO. In the first round-up on June 17, 1983 (a day labeled as ""the Black Friday of the NCO"" by the Neapolitan press), 856 people were arrested on a single day of coordinated operations involving 8,000 police and carabinieri. Of those arrested in a series of raids, 300 were convicted very quickly and another 630 committed for trial. Overall more than a thousand would later be indicted on the crime of association with the NCO. 
The resulting Maxi Trial lasted three years and required the participation of nine different judges and scores of legal clerks, attorneys, witnesses, and military policemen. The legal records which included audiotapes of the entire proceedings filled an entire room at Naples' hall of justice. 
There was also a steady stream of pentiti or supergrasses during this period, beginning with Pasquale Barra, who realizing that Cutolo was prepared to let him be killed, decided to reveal details of NCO murders in order to gain greater protection. He was then followed by Giovanni Pandico, one of the NCO's 
underwriter's whose accusations led to many arrests in the 1983 police crackdown. However, many of his accusations were later proven to be unfounded. The third major NCO supergrass was Mario Incarnato, who confessed to a series of murders in late 1983. In the mid-1980s, Giovanni Auriemma exposed the NCO's links with the secret services, whilst Pasquale D'Amico revealed Cutolo's links with the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta. 
Organized crime author Tom Behan illustrates the key factors leading to Cutolo's defeat and the downfall of the NCO: 
Cirillo Kidnapping.
Cutolo had also overplayed his hand in the Cirillo kidnapping affair. On April 27, 1981, the Red Brigades kidnapped the 60-year-old Christian Democrat (DC) politician Ciro Cirillo and killed his two-man escort in the garage of his Naples apartment building. At the time Cirillo directed reconstruction efforts in Campania devastated by the earthquake in the Irpinia region on November 23, 1980.
During the period in which Cirillo was missing, DC politician, Antonio Gava and his party associates contacted both the NCO and the NF with the view to them using their good standing with the Red Brigades to secure his release. The NF, under Carmine Alfieri refused to act, preferring to having nothing to do with the whole affair because he didn't want to be used by the politicians. However, Cirillo's release, as a result of the negotiations by Cutolo and the NCO, raised the spectre for Alfieri and the NF that the NCO had reinforced their association with Gava and his faction by this action. 
In return for negotiating the release of Cirillo, Cutolo allegedly asked for a slackening of police operations against the Camorra, for control over the tendering of building contracts in Campania (a lucrative venture since the devastating earthquake in November 1980) and for a reduction of his own sentence – as well as new psychiatric test to show that he is not responsible for his actions. Both these last concessions were granted.
Later, Cutolo began to blackmail Gava, demanding that he respect the deal made and threatening, in the event of non compliance, to create a public scandal by revelations that would have devastated the state institutions (i.e., The Secret Service) which had plotted with him to secure the hostage's release. As a result, his former political protectors turned and provided their support to his main rival Carmine Alfieri.
Pasquale Galasso, the Nuova Famiglia leader who later became a pentito, briefly elaborated the post-kidnapping tension that existed between the DC and NCO, while testifying in court: 
Alfieri, on the other hand, was also very keen to destroy Cutolo. He was well aware that had Cutolo received the advantages he had hoped for, then he would not hesitate to destroy any rival gang. As Galasso stated in court: 
Decline of the NCO.
It appears that Alfieri had already decided to eliminate the senior NCO leaders for the murders of his brothers during the war. In November 1982, the NCO's financier, Alfonso Ferrara Rosanova, was murdered. When his deputy and main 'military' chief, Vincenzo Casillo was killed via car bomb in January 1983 by Alfieri's ally, Pasquale Galasso, it was clear that Raffaele Cutolo had lost the war. His power declined considerably. Not only Cutolo but many other Camorra gangs understood the shift in the balance of power caused by the death of Casillo. They abandoned the NCO and allied themselves with Alfieri.
The assassination of Casillo was followed by the murders of several NCO members by the Nuova Famiglia. Casillo's partner disappeared a few weeks after his death, and her body was eventually found under in a ditch under a motorway in December 1983. Nicola Nuzzo, a key NCO member involved in the negotiations was battered to death in the ward of a Roman hospital in 1986, soon after a meeting with an investigating magistrate, Carlo Alemi. Salvatore Imperatrice, Casillo's bodyguard and also a member of the NCO negotiating team, died mysteriously in a mental asylum in March 1989. Mario Cuomo, who lost his legs in the explosion that killed Casillo, was eventually murdered in October 1990. Enrico Madonna, Cutolo's defense lawyer was murdered in October 1993, three days after telling a journalist that he was willing to tell a parliamentary commission all he knew about the Cirillo kidnapping affair. Most of the murders were linked to the Cirillo Affair.
Cutolo's influence was also reduced when at the insistence of President Sandro Pertini, he was relocated to a prison on the island Asinara in January 1982, far away from Naples and his ability to communicate with the outside was severely restricted when the harsh 41-bis prison regime was imposed upon him.
The elimination of the key NCO figures not only marked the end of the NCO's defeat as a political and criminal force, but also the rise of Carmine Alfieri and the NF who, by now, virtually unopposed, replaced them as the main contact of the politicians and businessmen in Campania as well as other criminal organizations. These chain of killings, including that of Cutolo's son, Roberto Cutolo who was shot dead by members of the Fabbrocino clan on December 24, 1990, aged 25, coupled with the incarceration of many of its members brought an end to the Nuova Camorra Organizzata. However, with Cutolo and the NCO out of the picture, the NF alliance soon disintegrated into many feuding clans, with a war breaking out between the Bardellino and Nuvoletta clans towards the end of 1983.

Trolleybuses in Glasgow

The Glasgow trolleybus system operated in the City of Glasgow, Scotland, between 1949 and 1967, with the network reaching its largest extent in 1959. It was the only British system to open after World War II.
The trolleybuses were owned and operated by Glasgow Corporation's Transport Department (along with the city's buses, trams and the Subway).
Routes.
All Glasgow's trolleybus routes were numbered from 101 onwards. Summary of services:
Vehicles.
The majority of Glasgow's trolleybuses were double-deck vehicles, painted in Glasgow Corporation's orange, green and cream livery (though in a different style from the buses and trams). The destination blinds on the trolleybuses used white letters on a green background (unlike the trams and buses, with more conventional white lettering on a black background).
Glasgow's first trolleybuses were a fleet of 34 three axle (six-wheeled), double-deck B.U.T. vehicles with bodywork by Metro-Cammell of Birmingham. They were almost identical to those built for London Transport, even briefly including London's distinctive trolleybus symbol (a "T" over the London Transport roundel). In 1950 Glasgow bought 30 Daimler trolleybuses.
Between 1957 and 1959, a fleet of 90 B.U.T. type 9613T trolleybuses with Crossley double-deck bodywork were built. Unlike the earlier vehicles, these trolleybuses had two axles.
<br clear=left>
Closure.
The trolleybuses (as well as the city's much larger tram fleet) used electricity generated at Pinkston power station, later sold to the South of Scotland Electricity Board. Following the closure of the tram system in 1962, the maintenance of the electrical supply system solely for the trolleybuses became impractically expensive. 
Construction of approach roads to the Clyde Tunnel led to the abandonment of trolleybus services to Linthouse and Shieldhall in 1964. In 1965 Glasgow Corporation agreed to purchase 150 new Leyland Atlantean diesel buses to replace the remaining trolleybuses. Glasgow's last trolleybuses ran on 27 May 1967.

History.
Early years (1995-2004).
Songwriter Mekaal Hasan, born in Lahore, Pakistan, was surrounded by music since childhood. His father, Masood Hasan, passion for jazz music influenced him throughout his early years. After graduating from Government College, Lahore, Mekaal studied music at the Berklee College of Music, Boston and his stay there exposed him to a wide variety of music and musicians, many of whom are influences to this day. 
In March 2001, Mekaal collaborated with Pete Lockett in a series of concerts countrywide featuring music written for Pete and classical artists by Mekaal. Pete Lockett has been featured on tour and on records by Peter Gabriel, Björk, Robert Plant, Simply Red, Afro-Celt Sound System and many others as well as on Hollywood movies such as the two James Bond movies, "Tomorrow Never Dies", "The World Is Not Enough", as well as "The Bone Collector" and "City of Angels". The music played in these concerts was a unique experience for all as this was the first time in the history of performances in Pakistan, that material written by a Pakistani musician for foreign artists was used. Following the artistic and public acclaim that the music received, Mekaal decided to continue writing music which would feature different classical and experimental artists who could contribute to the progressive and bold nature of the music that Mekaal Hasan Band play which is a fusion between the melodic sensibility of the East and the harmonic sophistication of the West.
The lead singer of The Mekaal Hasan Band, Javed Bashir, and flutist Papu are part of the older community of classically trained musicians living in Lahore. They released their debut album, "Sampooran", in 2004.

"Deadache" was released during the same week in about thirty countries. The official album release party was held at the Tavastia Club in Helsinki on 31 October 2008 (Hallowe'en).

Track listing.
Bonus tracks.
There are five different versions of the album, four of which have different bonus tracks. Each version was released by a different record company, hence the differing tracks.
"The House" on the Finnish version of the album is a cover of a song originally by the Finnish rock band Dingo. The song is written by Mr. Lordi, who translated the lyrics into English from the song's original Finnish version.
Japanese bonus DVD.
A bonus DVD version of "Deadache" was released in Japan and includes the following music videos:
Recording.
Lordi started the recording of "Deadache" on May 7, 2008. For the album, the group had sixty demos to choose from; fourteen of them were chosen by the band and record company to be recorded. All members of the group contributed songs to the album.
The recordings were finished in June, the group then going on tour in Europe.
Press.
Band members Kita and Amen said the following about the "Deadache":
"It's an old title. We had that song back in the '90s already, a song called 'Deadache', and our singer, Mr. Lordi, thought that he made that up, that whole word. Like, headache and deadache, but he heard it actually means something." [Mr. Amen "It actually, the title, it means something. Actually we had sixty songs to choose from and we picked out fifteen songs. We didn't think any (musical) directions or anything, we just did what we have." "Usually we don't think (laughs)" [Amen "We do what feels good with it."
Music.
"Deadache" is a melodic hard rock album, but has a heavier sound and includes more horror-themes than Lordi's previous albums. The album has more keyboard parts than "The Arockalypse", and the song "The Rebirth Of The Countess", composed by the keyboard player Awa, includes a spoken part in French. "Missing Miss Charlene" includes singing by a children's choir, with the outro being already recorded in 1986 by a 12-year old Mr. Lordi and some of his friends from his hometown of Rovaniemi.
The organ in the intro and between the verses in the song "The Devil Hides Behind Her Smile" is taken from "The Phantom of the Opera".
MySpace pre-listening session.
On 20 October 2008, Lordi announced that they would be adding a new track from "Deadache" to their MySpace page every day until Friday 24 October, the first release date of the album (in Germany).
