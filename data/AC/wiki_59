Scouting in the East Midlands

Scouting in East Midlands is about Scouting in the official region of East Midlands. It is largely represented by the Scout Association of the United Kingdom and some Groups of traditional Scouting including the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association.
There are four student associations at various universities in the region, each of which is affiliated to the Student Scout and Guide Organisation (SSAGO). These are "Students of Leicester Universities Guides and Scouts", covering the University of Leicester and De Montfort University, "Loughborough University Scout and Guide Club" covering Loughborough University, "Northampton University Scouts And Guides", covering the University of Northampton, and "Society of Nottingham Guides and Scouts" covering the University of Nottingham.
History of Scouting in East Midlands.
Lady Olave Baden-Powell(1889–1977), the 'World Chief Guide' was born Olave St. Clair Soames at Stubbing Court, Wingerworth, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Her husband, Robert Baden-Powell, the Founder of Scouting, wrote part of Scouting for Boys in the week following 15 June 1907 at the Izaak Walton Hotel in Ilam close to Dovedale in Derbyshire. Scouting links with the hotel have continued since Baden-Powell's death. In the summer of 2008, for example, Derbyshire Scouting presented a plaque to the Hotel to mark its link with "Scouting For Boys".
The 1st Nottingham (YMCA), 1st Buxton, 1st Market Harborough, 2nd Chesterfield and 4th Derby (Derwent) Scout Groups claim to have started in 1908.

Érika Cristiano dos Santos (born 4 February 1988 in São Paulo), commonly known as Érika, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a defender for Santos and the Brazilian Women's National Team.
Before being drafted by FC Gold Pride in the 2008 WPS International Draft, Érika was a member of Santos FC. Despite appearing in 7 games for FC Gold Pride, Érika was deemed surplus to requirements at season's close by Albertin Montoya.
Érika has represented Brazil at both the U-20 and senior international levels.
Controversy.
As part of the 2011 Brazilian world cup team, Erika was involved in a controversial play near the end of Brazil's game with the United States. At 115th minute of the game, with only a few minutes left in the game, Erika suddenly dropped to the field in apparent agony from a back spasm. After being attended to and being removed from the field on a stretcher, she suddenly jumped up and began running, clutching her back. This created controversy among sports analysts regarding the validity of her injury, with some assuming the injury was "faked" to quench a US rally. As a result of the delay, the referee, Jacqui Melksham, gave Erika a yellow card and added 3 minutes to the game as additional time, during which the US scored the game-tying goal, and went on to win the game on penalty kicks.

Caitlin Lowe

Caitlin Lowe (born 6 February 1985) is an American, former collegiate 4-time First Team All-American, left-handed hitting softball player originally from Tustin, California. She played for the University of Arizona Wildcats under head coach Mike Candrea and led her team in back-to-back NCAA Women's College World Series championships in 2006 and 2007. She won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. Lowe is currently with National Pro Fastpitch's USSSA Pride. She is one of select players in NCAA Division I history to have accumulated over 300 hits, 200 runs and 100 stolen bases while batting .400 in her career.
Early years.
At Foothill High School in Tustin, California, Caitlin was selected as an All-American 4 years in a row, and helped lead her team to state and national championships in 2000. In addition, she led the school to league championships in 2001, 2002, and 2003. In 2001, Caitlin received the All-League and Foothill High School MVP awards, and in 2003, she received the Orange County "Player of the Year" Award.
Arizona Wildcats.
For her freshman season at the University of Arizona, Lowe earned First Team All-American status and was named the Pac-10 "Newcomer of The Year" and was a top-10 Finalist for USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year. She jumped into top-10 rankings in Wildcat history for her run and stolen base totals.
The sophomore continued her success by earning all-season honors from both the NCAA and the Pac-10, including being named conference "Player of The Year." Her career best season average still ranks second all-time and her hits total top-10 at Arizona.
On February 26, she hit a career high 4 hits against the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters in a 7-0 win. The next month on March 27, Lowe would drive in 4 RBIs for another career high over the ULL Ragin’ Cajuns.
Lowe was named 2006 First Team All-American and Pac-10 for the third consecutive year. She posted another top-10 school record for her 33 stolen bases and was caught just twice all year long.
From February 25 through March 18, Lowe achieved a 15 consecutive game hit streak. She batted .510 (26/51) and had 12 RBIs, a home run, 4 tripes and two doubles to accompany a slugging of over .750%.
Starting in a doubleheader sweep of the Oregon Ducks on May 12, Lowe stole two bags in the games to begin a consecutive stolen bases streak that would reach into her senior season.
The Wildcats made it into the WCWS as the No. 2 seed and eventually trumped the Northwestern Wildcats in the finals, outscoring them a combined 13-0 over the two-game series; Lowe scored 4 of those runs. Lowe went 2/4 with an RBI in the June 6 finale and was named to the All-Tournament Team scoring a new series record 8 runs.
For a final season Lowe was named All-American, all-conference and newly bestowed with the conference "Defensive Player of The Year" Award. She also stole a school season second best 49 bags, being caught just once. Her resumed streak of consecutive stolen bases concluded on May 19 when the one time she was thrown out was by Chelsea Bramlett of Mississippi State Bulldogs. To that point, Lowe had amassed 47 consecutive stolen bases and 54 overall for the NCAA 7th best streak all-time.
Lowe and the Wildcats returned to defend their title at the 2007 WCWS. After riding the arm of tournament MVP Taryne Mowatt and escaping elimination through 4 games (three straight), Lowe won another National Championship defeating the Tennessee Lady Vols 5-0 on June 6. Lowe ended her career with a perfect day at the plate going 4/4 off USA Softball Collegiate Player of The Year Monica Abbott. She was named All-Tournament hitting .345 with two RBIs and three doubles.
Lowe is the Wildcat’s career leader in stolen bases, second in batting average (tied as NCAA 13th overall and 9th best for 4 year career) and ranks top-10 in hits (NCAA's 10th best), triples, runs and stolen bases (also 10th in the NCAA). At Arizona, she was known for her welcoming and volunteering nature and helped other student athletes become acclimated to college through Arizona’s Peer Athletic Leaders (PAL). Her senior year, Caitlin was awarded the inaugural Lowe’s Senior CLASS Softball Award, which acknowledges personal qualities that define a complete student athlete, such as excellence in the classroom, character and community, as well as success in athletic competition. Lowe is one of only six Wildcat players to be named an NFCA All-American in each of her four years with the program and joined Leah Braatz (1994, 95, 97, 98) as the only player in Arizona history to be awarded first-team All-America all four years.
Team USA.
Caitlin began her national career in 2004 as a member of the USA Schutt Elite Team at the Canada and Champions Cups, where she scored a team-high 16 runs. In 2005, Caitlin joined the United States National Team and helped the team earn silver medals in the Japan and World Cups. She was one of the youngest members of the 2006 World Championship team. Caitlin also helped the team win the World Cup in 2006 and 2007, where she posted a team high 6 hits with three runs scored. She earned a gold medal at the 2007 Pan American games, and that season tied for the most hits, a team high with two triples and scored 21 runs, the second best on the team. That year, Caitlin’s impressive base running and speed also earned her a perfect 9 stolen bases in 9 attempts.
Caitlin Lowe has been a member of the U.S. Women's National Softball Team since 2005. USA Softball Head Coach Mike Candrea says, "She's all out all the time and plays the game like a giant."
Leading up the 2008 Olympics, Lowe hit .455 on the Bound 4 Beijing Tour and was tied leading the team in triples, second in stolen bases and had a perfect fielding percentage. At the Games, Lowe began her tournament with a 3/4 effort in a run-rule of Venezuela, including hitting the first-ever inside-the-park home run in Games history. On August 20, Lowe and Team USA went extra innings in the semifinals vs. Japan and she hit the RBI single to take the lead before scoring on Crystl Bustos' winning three-run homer. She had two hits in the gold medal game but made the last out in the 3-1 loss. Lowe was tied in at-bats for the tournament and hit .357 overall.
Personal life.

Kelly Kretschman

Kelly Kretschman (born 26 August 1979) is an American, former 4-time collegiate All-American, left-handed hitting softball player originally from Indian Harbour Beach, Florida. She played for the Alabama Crimson Tide (1998–2001) and won a gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics and a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She also played in the National Pro Fastpitch with the Stratford Brakettes and currently plays with the USSSA Pride. She owns numerous records for the Tide. She is one of select NCAA Division I players to bat .400 with 300 hits, 200 runs and 100 stolen bases.
Alabama Crimson Tide.
The freshman's campaign saw her named to the NCAA Division I All-American and All-SEC second teams. She broke both school and conference season records in batting average, home runs, hits (NCAA all-time Freshman Class record) and slugging percentage (which led the NCAA that year). Her RBIs, triples, runs and on-base percentage ranked top-10 at Alabama; she still claims all those top season records but has been surpassed in the average.
Starting February 27 and lasting until April 4, she went on the NCAA's third best consecutive game hit streak (35). She hit .521 (62/119) on 15 home runs, 5 triples and 15 doubles to slug 1.109%. For one of her games, Kretschman reached career single game highs in RBIs (5) and hits (4), as well as hitting a school record two triples to end the game on a run-rule victory over the Wisconsin Badgers on March 1.
For the 1999 season, Kretschman repeated as All-American, moved up to First Team All-SEC and broke another school record with 30 stolen bases. Her hits and triples are top-10 for a season with the Tide.
Kretschman was named First Team All-American for the 2000 season and continued her all-conference success. She ranked top-10 in school history for virtually every season stat: average, RBIs, home runs, triples, doubles, hits, base on balls, runs, stolen bases, slugging and on-base percentages. The hits total (102) led the NCAA that year and is still the school record while every other latter category is a top-10 Tide record.
The Tide made it into their first Women's College World Series and Kretschman's only career appearance at the series, she hit .333 with 3 RBIs and slugging over .550% to be named to the All-Tournament Team. The Tide were eventually eliminated by the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles despite nabbing a victory over DePaul.
For a final season, Kretschman would be named First Team All-American and All-SEC. She entered more top-10 season records for average, hits, walks and percentages to the Alabama Crimson Tide program. 
Besting the Michigan Wolverines 7-2 on February 28, Kretschman connected for her 50th career home run off pitcher Meghan Ritter.
Kretschman would graduate owning career records in average, RBIs, home runs, triples, doubles, hits, walks, runs, stolen bases, slugging and on-base percentages. She retains all records except for the RBIs, walks and stolen base career totals. She is tops in the SEC for runs and slugging percentage, which also is 6th best all-time in the NCAA Division I.
Team USA.
Kretschman began her career with Team USA in 2000 while still a student at Alabama. On the "Aiming For Athens" tour, she would hit .471. She had tour highs of 5 RBIs (in part courtesy of a grand slam) vs. the UCLA Bruins on March 28 and a perfect 4/4 hit game over the Texas Longhorns on March 9, 2004.
At the Olympics, Kretschman at one point had a 5 game RBI streak. She went 1/3 vs. Australia in the August 23 finale to earn gold. Kretschman was tied leading the team in triples, doubles and was perfect in the field.
The "Bound 4 Beijing" tour saw Kretschman lead the team in walks while hitting .467 and slugging .822%. On March 28, Team USA suffered a 1-0 loss that snapped their perfect Olympic tours record at the hands of Angela Tincher and the Virginia Tech Hokies. Kretschman walked in the second inning to disrupt what was otherwise a perfect game.
In the August 21 Olympic softball finale vs. Japan, Kretschman was shut out by Yukiko Ueno managing only a walk as the US was downed 3-1 to take silver. In her last international tournament, Kretschman hit .348 for Team USA.
National Pro Fastpitch.
Kretschman began her career with the Akron Racers in 2005 and hit .280. From the next year on 2006–2011, not including 2008, Kretschman would play for the Connecticut Brakettes, Washington Glory and finally the USSSA Pride. In 2006 (where she hit a career best .410), 2009, 2010 she was named an NPF All-Star. 
She also won three straight Cowles Cup Championships from 2005 to 2007. In 2010 she won her 4th title; in her other two seasons of play, Kretschman was a finalist for the title. She claimed her 5th NPF Cowles Cup on August 24, 2013. In the combined finals games, Kretschman went 4/18 with two RBIs. She did not play in the 2011 finale. Kretschman set a league record with 35 walks in 2006. This helped Kretschman attain the current career record for walks at 183. She also ranks second in doubles and third in RBIs in her 8-year tenure.

Suspect (2008 film)

The short feature Suspect ("Der Verdacht") was the final graduation project of director Felix Hassenfratz
at the Internationale filmschule köln. The story, inspired by true events and based on the documentary "The Baker Did It," is set in a southern German province with the Badisch dialect. The film is a co-production with the broadcast stations SWR and ARTE, and supported by a German film fund. Despite its regional emphasis, "Suspect" is a universal story, focused on human behaviour, a story about love in the face of doubt.
Synopsis.
What to do and whom to believe when you live in a small village and your husband, the village baker, is the suspect in an unsolved murder? He’s not from the village and your mother still doesn’t accept his taking over the family business after your father's death. You also find a shirt stained with blood and a gun kept in a locked cabinet, and he insists he’s innocent. Can love overcome doubt?

Fabiana da Silva Simões

Fabiana da Silva Simões (born 4 August 1989), known as Fabiana or Fabiana Baiana (by adding the demonym of Bahia, her home state), is a Brazilian football winger who plays for Swedish Damallsvenskan club Tyresö FF. In 2009 and 2010 she played professional club football in America with Boston Breakers of Women's Professional Soccer (WPS). As well as teams in her native Brazil, Fabiana has played for Sporting de Huelva of Spain's Primera División and WFC Rossiyanka of the Russian Top Division.
Fabiana has represented the Brazil women's national football team since her debut in June 2008 and won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She retained her national team place for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany and the 2012 London Olympics. A right sided attacking player noted for her pace and skill, Fabiana can also function as an overlapping right back.
Club career.
Fabiana's career began aged 15, when she moved from Bahia to Rio to play for the women's section of America RJ. After a brief spell at CEPE-Caxias, she was signed by Spanish relegation-battlers Sporting de Huelva. 
In the 2008 WPS International Draft, Fabiana was selected by Boston Breakers. The American club's coach Tony DiCicco picked England's Kelly Smith in the first round and Fabiana in the second. DiCicco described his Brazilian acquisition as: "very fast and fits that quick Brazilian mold with lot of flair". 
An existing anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained while playing for Corinthians kept Fabiana out of the Breakers' team until the last seven games of 2009, all of which she started. Two games on loan to Boston Aztec in the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) had formed part of Fabiana's recuperation. She was given another contract for 2010 and started 14 of her 21 appearances, adding a goal against Chicago Red Stars. Ahead of season 2011, Boston made Fabiana a free agent, then made an unsuccessful attempt to sign her on reduced terms.
In August 2011 she joined Russian UEFA Women's Champions League contestant WFC Rossiyanka from Santos. After another brief return to Brazil with São José, Fabiana transferred to Tyresö in January 2014, one of four Brazilians joining their compatriot Marta at the Swedish club.
International career.
At the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship, FIFA.com reported that Fabiana contributed vital "skill and speed" to the Brazilian team which finished third.
She trained with the senior team ahead of the 2007 Pan American Games, but was not selected for the final squad. Good form with Corinthians saw Fabiana break into the squad ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics. She made her debut in a 2–1 win over Italy at Suwon Sports Complex in the 2008 Peace Queen Cup.

PRR D2

The Pennsylvania Railroad's steam locomotive class D2 (formerly Class B, pre-1895) comprised twenty 4-4-0 locomotives intended for mountain passenger helper service, constructed at the railroad's own Altoona Works during 1869–1880. 
They were the second standardized class of locomotives on the railroad and shared many parts with other standard classes.
This design differed from the Class A (later D1) mainly in its smaller drivers for greater tractive effort in mountainous terrain. Like all the early standardized 4-4-0s on the PRR, the Class B had a wagon-top boiler with steam dome and a firebox between the two driving axles.
In 1881, the PRR took the Class B design and modified it to produce more locomotives for express passenger service, with drivers like the earlier Class A. These new locomotives were designated Class B A, and were classified as B2a in the post-1895 scheme; forty-five of them were constructed.

Efficiency of conversion

The efficiency of conversion of ingested food to unit of body substance (ECI, also termed "growth efficiency") is an index measure of food fuel efficiency in animals. The ECI is a rough scale of how much of the food ingested is converted into growth in the animal's mass. It can be used to compare the growth efficiency as measured by the weight gain of different animals from consuming a given quantity of food relative to its size.
The ECI effectively represents efficiencies of both digestion (approximate digestibility or AD) and metabolic efficiency, or how well digested food is converted to mass (efficiency of conversion of digested food or ECD). The formula for the efficiency of food fuel is thus:

Redwatch

Redwatch is a British website associated with members of the far-right British People's Party. It publishes photographs of, and personal information about, alleged far left and anti-fascist activists. It typically targets activists in political parties, advocacy groups, trade unions and the media. There used to be a British magazine of the same name with similar subject matter, associated with Combat 18. The website's slogan is "Remember places, traitors' faces, they'll all pay for their crimes", a quote from neo-Nazi musician Ian Stuart Donaldson.
The information gathered by Redwatch is indexed by cities or regions. Many of the people listed are members of the Anti-Nazi League or other anti-racist or left-wing groups, such as the Socialist Party (UK), the Socialist Party (Ireland), Sinn Féin, Social Democratic and Labour Party, Alliance for Workers' Liberty, Workers' Power (UK) and Socialist Workers Party (Britain). Some Labour Party, Liberal Democrat and Conservative members are also listed. Trade unionists, in particular teachers and journalists, figure prominently in the listings. There are dozens of photographs of anarchists and single-issue protesters.
Redwatch justifies its content as a reaction to leftist websites and magazines who display similar content: "Photographs and information about the reds who attempt to harass and assault British Nationalists and their families. The red scum target us, Redwatch plays them at their own game." Justifications provided by the website include an email circulated in August 2001 by the Anti-Nazi League, containing the home addresses of Nick Griffin (leader of the British National Party) and his mother, who was involved in the organisation of a BNP festival.
History.
Redwatch was first published in paper form by the neo-Nazi paramilitary group Combat 18 in March 1992, when its slogan was "oderint dum metuant": "let them hate as long as they fear" (a quotation from Caligula).
The website in its current form was hosted by Simon Sheppard, a former British National Party (BNP) member who was expelled after circulating a leaflet which the BNP leadership regarded as a "prima facie" breach of race-discrimination legislation. On May 1, 2005, Sheppard's home in Hull was searched by police investigating "incitement to racial hatred."
In January 2004, questions concerning the legality of the Redwatch website were raised in the House of Lords. The Home Office have stated that listing public information online is not a crime.
The website has been heavily criticised by the Trades Union Congress and many of its affiliate unions. Following the TUC's annual Congress in September 2004, where an anti-Redwatch resolution was passed, the TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber wrote to Home Secretary David Blunkett, requesting a meeting to discuss the issue. Further discussions and correspondence with government members ensued, and in March 2005, a meeting took place with Home Secretary Charles Clarke. The TUC have promised to provide the Home Secretary with examples of experiences that trade unionists and other left-wing campaigners have had as a result of having their details published on Redwatch, whilst the Home Secretary promised to hold discussions with the police about what could be done to stop the activities of the website.
The website went down around December 6, 2008, with all of its various URLs leading directly to error or Internet service provider pages. It returned later that month.
On March 2, 2013, the anti-fascist Hope not Hate claimed that the police had arrested Kevin Watmough from Redwatch and confiscated his computers for investigation.
Association with violence.
There have been many reports to the police of people receiving death threats after their details have appeared on the Redwatch website. These have included Members of Parliament and their families. According to "Searchlight", a Leeds teacher who complained about a far right activist, Antony White, leafleting his school, had his details listed on Redwatch, allegedly after the jailing of White. Far right supporters then firebombed the teacher's car. According to "Indymedia", an anti-racist was followed and attacked on May 16, 2006 after the recent appearance of his personal data on the Redwatch website. The assailants reportedly shouted "We'll kill you, you leftist motherfucker!"
Merseyside Trades Union Congress organiser Alec McFadden received death threats shortly after his details appeared on the website. At precisely the same time, Joe Owens, a Merseyside BNP candidate with several convictions for violent offences, began sending him emails gloating that he had photographic details of his house, car and family. Since standing as a Respect - The Unity Coalition candidate in the May 2006 elections, McFadden has been physically attacked, including being stabbed in the face at his home.
In May 2006, a Polish political activist was attacked and stabbed, requiring surgery. He stated that he believed the attack was linked to his recent listing on the Polish version of the website. In March 2008, the attacker, a member of the neo-Nazi Blood and Honour, was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for attempted murder.
Websites outside Britain.
The British website links to Redwatch sites in Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and New Zealand.

Guillermo Sucre

Guillermo Sucre Figarella (born 15 May, 1933), is a Venezuelan poet and literary critic born in Tumeremo in the state of Bolivar. He is also a member of the notable Sucre family like his uncle Jose Antonio Ramos Sucre and his older brothers General Juan Manuel Sucre Figarella and Senator Leopoldo Sucre Figarella.
Literary critic and academic.
His most important critical work is made up the volumes "Borges, el poeta" (1967), a wise incursion into the writings of the Argentine master, Jorge Luis Borges and "La máscara, la transparencia" (1975), an acute analysis of the paths of contemporary Latin American poetry. There are new corrected and augmented editions of both. He has also translated into Spanish the works of André Breton, Saint-John Perse, William Carlos Williams and Wallace Stevens.
In 1957 he founded the literary journal Sardío and an associated literary group. He began teaching at the Universidad Central de Venezuela in that same year. From 1968 till 1975 he lived in the United States, where he lectured at the University of Pittsburgh and became a member Pitt's Instituto Internacional de Literatura Iberoamericana. Upon his return to Venezuela he taught at the Universidad Simón Bolívar and became literary director of the publishing house Monte Ávila Editores.
He won the National Prize for Literature in 1976 for his essay "La máscara, la transparencia".
Poetry.
His poetic work has a singular place within Venezuelan literature. He is a poet of light, like the Bolivian Eduardo Mitre or the Mexican Homero Aridjis, and like them he makes of the splendour and magnificence of the tropics the first motivation behind his poetry. His work is also heavily inspired by sensuality. Thus, writes Sucre in his collection of poems entitled, "En el verano cada palabra respira en el verano" (1976) to note "the hard / the fleeting transparency". It was him who invited, from the pages of his first book, "Mientras suceden los días" (1961), to walk towards "the invisible kingdom", which refers to that which he has imagined. He is a poet trying not to get lost in "that lighting that lit up my childhood... where I see and recognize myself / my face", as his "La mirada" (1970) reads. In his verses we find Octavio Paz's influence, as evidenced in his poem "Sino gestos", also included in "La mirada", which reads: "condemned to the same decay / the poem / the hand that writes it / and that erases it / the gaze that follows it / and rejects it / he that dreams it / and who also invents it"

Climate change in Wyoming

On a per-person basis, Wyoming emits more carbon dioxide than any other state or any other country: of it per capita a year, because of burning coal, which provides nearly all of the state's electrical power.
Over the last century, the average temperature in Laramie, Wyoming, has increased 1.5°F (0.8°C), and precipitation has decreased by up to 20% in many parts of the state.
Over the next century, climate in Wyoming may change even more. For example, based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the United Kingdom Hadley Centre’s climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100 temperatures in Wyoming could increase by 4°F (2°C) in spring and fall (with a range of 2-7°F), 5°F (2.5°C) in summer (with a range of 2-8°F), and 6°F (3°C) in winter (with a range of 3-11°F). Precipitation is estimated to decrease slightly in summer (with a range of 0-10%), increase by 10% in spring and fall (with a range of 5-20%), and increase by 30% in winter (with a range of 10-50%). Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The amount of precipitation on extreme wet or snowy days in winter is likely to increase. The frequency of extreme hot days in summer would increase because of the general warming trend. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of winter storms is possible.
Impacts.
Human health.
Warmer temperatures could increase the incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in Wyoming, because populations of ticks, and their rodent hosts, could increase under warmer temperatures and increased vegetation. Increased runoff from heavy rainfall could increase water-borne diseases such as giardia, cryptosporidia, and viral and bacterial gastroenteritis.
Water resources.
The headwaters of several rivers originate in Wyoming and flow in all directions into the Missouri, Snake, and Colorado River basins. Within the state, water is plentiful in some parts and scarce in others.
Winter snow accumulation and spring snowmelt strongly affect many of Wyoming’s rivers. A warmer climate could result in less winter snowfall, more winter rain, and faster, earlier spring snowmelt. In the summer, without increases in rainfall of at least 15-20%, higher temperatures and increased evaporation could lower streamflows and lake levels. Less water would be available to support irrigation, hydropower generation, public water supplies, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and mining.
Competition for water could increase on the plains, where agricultural and industrial users compete for available water. Similarly, in northeastern Wyoming, which has large deposits of minerals, coal, and petroleum, competition between mining, energy, and other users could intensify for the meager summer streamflows.
Groundwater levels in several areas of the state are declining because of increased pumpage for irrigation and urban development. Less spring and summer recharge could lower groundwater levels. 
Tourism and recreation, important components of Wyoming’s economy, also depend on adequate supplies of clean water.
Higher temperatures and lower flows could impair water quality by concentrating pollutants and reducing assimilative capacity.
Agriculture.
Warmer climates and less soil moisture due to increased evaporation may increase the need for irrigation. However, these same conditions could decrease water supplies, which also may be needed by natural ecosystems, urban populations, industry, and other users.
Under these conditions, livestock tend to gain less weight and pasture yields decline, limiting forage.
Forests.
With changes in climate, the extent of forested areas in Wyoming could change little or decline by as much as 15-30%.
Hotter, drier weather could increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires, threatening both property and forests. Drier conditions would reduce the range and health of ponderosa and lodgepole forests, and increase their susceptibility to fire. Grasslands and rangeland could expand into previously forested areas in the western part of the state. Milder winters could increase the likelihood of insect outbreaks and of subsequent wildfires in the dead fuel left after such an outbreak.
Ecosystems.
Since the massive fires of 1988, when nearly half of Yellowstone National Park burned, scientists have been paying close attention to the possible threats from climate change. Experts agree that the fires of 1988 came about as result of a winter drought, a hot dry summer, and unusually strong winds. Also important were the large areas of highly flammable, old-growth lodgepole pine forest. 
Under normal conditions, large fires like those of 1988 occur only once in every few generations. But, with approximately 40% of the Yellowstone still vulnerable to large-scale burns, any increased fire risk due to climate change would pose a significant problem. The replacement of old-growth forest stands by younger stands could threaten northern twinflower, Fairy Slipper, pine marten, and goshawk. Outbreaks of defoliating attacks by western spruce budworms could occur more frequently and become much more damaging for the conifer forests.
Climate change also poses a threat to the high alpine systems, and this zone could disappear in many areas. Local extinctions of alpine species such as arctic gentian, alpine chaenactis, rosy finch, and water pipit could be expected as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. Even a modest warming and drying could reduce whitebark pine habitat by up to 90% within 50 years. Whitebark pine nuts and army cutworm moth caterpillars, which are found in these forests, provide vital food for Wyoming’s grizzly bear population. Whitebark pine forest may be replaced with Douglas fir, and on the lower slopes, forest would give way to treeless landscapes dominated by big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.
Action on climate change.
Renewable energy.
The Wyoming Infrastructure Authority (WIA) has partnerships to secure tax credit bonds for construction of renewable energy projects. WIA accepted proposals for projects using resources from wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, small irrigation power, trash combustion, certain refined coal production, and certain hydropower projects. 
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes $500 million Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBS) for government agencies. The bonds serve as tax credits for the private-sector partners and provide as tax-free capital financing for renewable energy projects.
WIA is an organization formed by the Wyoming Legislature in 2004 to encourage economic development in Wyoming through the expansion of the state's electricity transmission capacity. Since the renewable power projects would use the transmission capability managed by WIA, the agency will evaluate proposals that meet its criteria. 
Geothermal energy.
In cooperation with the Wyoming Business Council, the Converse Area New Development Organization drafted an initiative to advance geothermal energy development in Wyoming. The state is a prime candidate for geothermal direct use applications such as home heating and cooling, spas, agriculture, aquaculture, greenhouses, and space heating. 
The Wyoming Geothermal Outreach Program aims to increase public awareness of opportunities in geothermal energy, as it works with government and industry to improve the state's regulatory and economic environment. It will promote environmentally compatible heat and power, industrial growth, and economic development. The program will create geothermal information-sharing tools, including workshops, a Web site, and information packets. Representatives will engage in trade missions to other states to research best practices in geothermal development. 
Solar.
The Wyoming Business Council offers grants for homeowners who want to install photovoltaic (PV) systems . Wyoming's Residential Photovoltaic Grant Program promotes the use of PV by granting half the cost of installing a PV system up to $3,000. The grant program has provided matching grants for 139 residential PV installations, which have a combined rated capacity of 80 kilowatts.
Twenty-five grants will be awarded this year. Because of the demand for these grants, the program will be using a lottery system to select recipients.
Biofuels.
Ethanol motor fuel production tax credit.
Ethanol fuel producers may redeem a tax credit of $0.40 per gallon with the Wyoming Department of Transportation. Ethanol blended motor fuel is defined as a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline that is used to operate motor vehicles. To be eligible to receive this credit, at least 25% of an ethanol producer's distillation feedstock purchases must be products that originate in Wyoming, excluding water, during the year the tax credits were earned. The total credits redeemed by all ethanol producers may not exceed $4 million per year, and the total credits redeemed by any individual ethanol producer may not exceed $2 million per year.
Additionally, an ethanol producer constructing a new ethanol production facility may receive tax credits for a period not to exceed 15 years after the date that construction is completed. Any ethanol producer that expands its production by at least 25% is eligible for tax credits with an increased maximum amount. Qualifying ethanol producers may only receive a tax credit through June 30, 2009.
Energy conservation.
The Wyoming Energy Conservation Improvement Program (WYECIP) is a performance contracting program for energy conservation in public and private nonprofit facilities. Theses facilities include state agencies, local governments, schools, colleges, hospitals, nursing homes, and other nonprofit agencies. 
The Wyoming Business Council, which also manages the State Energy Program in Wyoming, has prequalified 10 energy service companies under the program and manages the process of implementing performance contracts for the facility owners. 
Through performance contracting, participating state and nonprofit agencies can hire the prequalified contractors for energy efficiency upgrades and pay for it with energy savings.

Flora of Western Australia

The flora of Western Australia comprises 9,437 published native vascular plant species of 1,543 genera within 226 families; there are also 1,171 naturalised alien or invasive plant species more commonly known as weeds. There are an estimated 150,000 cryptogam species or nonvascular plants which include lichens, and fungi although only 1,786 species have been published, with 948 algae and 672 lichen the majority.
History.
Indigenous Australians have a long history with the flora of Western Australia. They have for over 50,000 years obtained detailed information on most plants. The information includes its uses as sources for food, shelter, tools and medicine. As Indigenous Australians passed the knowledge along orally or by example, most of this information has been lost, along many of the names they gave the flora. It was not until Europeans started to explore Western Australia that systematic written details of the flora commenced.
1690s to 1829.
The first scientific collection of flora from Western Australia was by William Dampier near Shark Bay and in the Dampier Archipelago in 1699. This collection is housed in the Fielding Druce Herbarium; of the 24 species collected, 15 were published by John Ray and Leonard Plukenet. There were two species of Western Australian flora published in 1768 by Burman that are thought to have been collected by Willem de Vlamingh during his exploration of the area around the Swan River in 1697.
In September 1791 Archibald Menzies collected specimens around the King George Sound area while on the Vancouver Expedition. French botanist Jacques Labillardiere in December 1792 as part of the d'Entrecasteaux expedition collected specimens in the Esperance area before the expedition went onto explore parts of Tasmania. Between 1801–1803 Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour was the botanist on Baudins exploration of the WA coast. Labillardiere used the specimens collected to publish the two volume "Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen" in 1804 and 1807. Of the species originally named by Labillardiere, 105 were still in use in 2000.
While Baudin was exploring the coast with Jean Leschenault de la Tour taking specimens, botanist Robert Brown was with Matthew Flinders in the "Investigator" circumnavigating Australia. During this voyage Brown collected over 600 specimens from Western Australia between December 1801 and January 1802 and from a short stopover in 1803 before returning to England. On returning to England using the specimens he collected and those of other collectors, Brown published "Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae" in 1810. Along with further publications in 1814 and 1849, Brown created many of the now readily recognisable names of Western Australian flora like "Leschenaultia", which was named after Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour, "Caladenia", and "Dryandra". As of January 2000, over 800 of the species published by Brown are still current.
With increasing interest in the western third of Australia, more botanists were able to collect specimens while on various voyages. Allan Cunningham was aboard the "Mermaid" in King's surveys between 1817 and 1822 of the Western Australian coast; Cunningham's collections included significant specimens from the northern areas of Western Australia. The establishment of an outpost at King George Sound in 1827 and the founding of the Swan River Colony in 1829 opened Western Australia up to exploration by botanists.
1829 to 1900.
After settlement in 1829 Western Australia, particularly the south west was more accessible to botanists. During the 1830s–1840s, this included Stephen Endlicher, John Lindley, Johann Lehmann and Ludwig Preiss. The botanists depended on local settlers James Drummond, George Maxwell and many more both during their stay and afterwards for further specimens and observations. From December 1838 through to January 1842 Preiss collected approximately 200,000 plant specimens, including specimens purchased from settlers like Drummond. Naturalist John Gilbert, employed by John Gould to collect specimens in Western Australia, was dismayed at the prices he was paying. 
In 1863 George Bentham published the first volume of a seven volume series called "Flora Australiensis" which included descriptions for 8,125 taxa. This was the first detailed account of Australian flora which included many Western Australian species as the work covered the relationship between many of the larger plant families which occurred across the continent. As Bentham had never been to Australia, he based all his work on the material already collected, assisted by Ferdinand von Mueller Victoria's colonial botanist. Mueller made two visits to WA in 1867 and 1871 to collect material and 1,122 of the Western Australian species described by Mueller are still in use. In 1882, and revised in 1889, Mueller produced a census of WA flora listing 3,560 individual species.
1901 to 1928.
During 1900–01 Ludwig Deils and Ernst Pritzel collected around 5700 specimens, publishing an account of the specimens in 1904-05 that included 200 new species. In 1906 Deils published the first ecological regions for Western Australia flora, dividing the state into three biological provinces. J. J. East in 1912, as part of the "Cyclopedia of Western Australia", wrote an essay that noted 4,166 plant species had been identified and included the three biological provinces described by Diels.
After Federation in 1901 many new government departments began small herbaria, run by botanists like Alexander Morrison, Frederick Stoward and Desmond Herbert. These departments contributed to local history journals along with other collectors, such as William Fitzgerald, who in 1918 published an extensive work on the botany of the Kimberleys. In 1928 the amalgamation of the Forestry and the Agricultural departments' herbaria formed the state herbarium.
Western Australian Herbarium.
The Western Australian Herbarium is the state herbarium. Part of the State government's Department of Environment and Conservation, it is responsible for the description and documentation of the flora of Western Australia.
In 1970 the Herbarium began publication of the journal "Nuytsia". The name came from the genus of a parasitic trees more commonly known as Christmas Trees, "Nuytsia floribunda". The journal gives preference to original publications on Western Australian flora including systematic analyses, taxa revisions and highlighting potential invasive species. Approximately 20% of all published Western Australia flora have been formally described in the journal since its inception. Kevin Thiele is the current editor of Nutysia and curator of the Herbarium.
FloraBase.
FloraBase is a public access web-based database of the flora of Western Australia. It provides authoritative scientific information on taxa, including descriptions, maps, images, conservation status and nomenclatural details. In addition to native species, FloraBase provides information on alien taxa that have naturalised in Western Australia.
Biodiversity.
Western Australia has 9,437 native vascular plant species from 1,543 genera within 226 families which is half of the identified plant species in Australia. There are an estimated 150,000 Cryptogam species or non vascular plants which include Lichens, and Fungi although only 1,786 species have been published, with 948 Algae and 672 lichen the majority.
Southwest Australia.
Southwest Australia is a biodiversity hotspot that includes the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of Western Australia. The region has a wet-winter, dry-summer Mediterranean climate, covers 356,717 km², consisting of a coastal plain 20-120 kilometers wide, transitioning to gently undulating uplands made up of weathered granite, gneiss and laterite. Desert and xeric shrublands lie to the north and east across the center of Australia, separating Southwest Australia from the other Mediterranean and humid-climate regions of the continent.

N! conjecture

In mathematics, the "n"! conjecture is the conjecture that the dimension of a certain bi-graded module of diagonal harmonics is "n"!. It was made by A. M. Garsia and M. Haiman and later proved by M. Haiman. It implies Macdonald's positivity conjecture about the Macdonald polynomials.
Formulation and background.
The Macdonald polynomials formula_1 are a two-parameter family of orthogonal polynomials indexed by a positive weight λ of a root system, introduced by Ian G. Macdonald (1987). They generalize several other families of orthogonal polynomials, such as Jack polynomials and Hall–Littlewood polynomials. They are known to have deep relationships with affine Hecke algebras and Hilbert schemes, which were used to prove several conjectures made by Macdonald about them.
In fact, we can obtain in this manner the Schur functions, the Hall–Littlewood symmetric functions, the Jack symmetric functions, the zonal symmetric functions, the zonal spherical functions, and the elementary and monomial symmetric functions.
The so-called ("q","t")-Kostka polynomials are the coefficients of a resulting transition matrix. Macdonald conjectured that they are polynomials in "q" and "t", with non-negative integer coefficients.
It was Adriano Garsia's idea to construct an appropriate module in order to prove positivity (as was done in his previous joint work with Procesi on Schur positivity of Kostka–Foulkes polynomials).
In an attempt to prove Macdonald's conjecture, introduced the bi-graded module formula_2 of diagonal harmonics and conjectured that the (modified) Macdonald polynomials are the Frobenius image of the character generating function of "H"μ, under the diagonal action of the symmetric group.
The proof of Macdonald's conjecture was then reduced to the "n"! conjecture; i.e., to prove that the dimension of "H"μ is "n"!. In 2001, Haiman proved that the dimension is indeed "n"! (see ). 
This breakthrough led to the discovery of many hidden connections and new aspects of symmetric group representation theory, as well as combinatorial objects (e.g., insertion tableaux, Haglund's inversion numbers, and the role of parking functions in representation theory).

Pedra do Indaiá

Pedra do Indaiá is a Brazilian municipality located in the center of the state of Minas Gerais. Its population as of 2007 was 3,921 people living in a total area of 349 km². The city belongs to the meso-region of Oeste de Minas and to the micro-region of Formiga. It became a municipality in 1962.
Origin of the name.
The origin lies in the legend of an image of Jesus left near a stone (pedra) and later ""discovered"". A chapel was built in stone and soon people began to build their houses nearby. The settlement grew and was first called Senhor Bom Jesus da Pedra do Indaiá. In 1923 it became Pedra do Indaiá. In 1962 it separated from Itapecerica and became a municipality.
Location.
The city center of Pedra do Indaiá is located at an elevation of 693 meters approximately halfway between Formiga and Divinópolis. It is just north of state highway MG-050, which connects Belo Horizonte to Passos. Neighboring municipalities are: Santo Antônio do Monte (N), São Sebastião do Oeste (E), Itapecerica (S), and Formiga (W).
Distances to other cities
Economic activities.
Services, small industry, and agriculture are the most important economic activities. In 2005 there were 9 extractive industries (quarries) and 13 transformation industries. Transformation industries employed 340 workers. The GDP in 2005 was approximately R$29 million, 3 million reais from taxes, 11 million reais from services, 9 million reais from industry, and 5 million reais from agriculture. There were 463 rural producers on 19,000 hectares of land (2006). 33 farms had tractors (2006). Approximately 1,100 persons were involved in agriculture. The main crops are rice, beans, and corn. There were 11,000 head of cattle (2006).
There were no banks (2007). The motor vehicle fleet had 482 automobiles, 51 trucks, 45 pickup trucks, and 223 motorcycles (2007).
Health and education.
In the health sector there were 6 public health clinics, one of which was specialized. Patients with more serious health conditions are transported to Formiga or Divinópolis. Educational needs of 750 students were met by 4 primary schools, 1 middle school, and 1 pre-primary school.
In 2000 the per capita monthly income of R$183.00 was well below the state and national average of R$276.00 and R$297.00 respectively. Poços de Caldas had the highest per capita monthly income in 2000 with R$435.00. The lowest was Setubinha with R$73.00.
The highest ranking municipality in Minas Gerais in 2000 was Poços de Caldas with 0.841, while the lowest was Setubinha with 0.568. Nationally the highest was São Caetano do Sul in São Paulo with 0.919, while the lowest was Setubinha. In more recent statistics (considering 5,507 municipalities) Manari in the state of Pernambuco has the lowest rating in the country—0,467—putting it in last place.

List of governors of Penang

This is the list of people who have held the highest political office in Penang and its previous entities. Penang is a state in Malaysia. 
Until the 18th century, the island of Penang was part of the Sultanate of Kedah. In 1786, the island was leased by the Sultan of Kedah to an officer from the East India Company, Francis Light. Light renamed the island "Prince of Wales Island." In 1790, after suffering a military defeat at the hands of Light, Sultan Abdullah formally handed over the island to the British. Light was appointed Superintendent of Prince of Wales Island. From 1800 to 1805, the island was led by a Lieutenant Governor.
In 1805, Prince of Wales Island became a Residency, led by a Governor. In 1826, the island, along with Malacca and Singapore, were consolidated into the Straits Settlements. Thereafter, Penang was administered by a British Resident Councillor subordinate to the Governor of the Straits Settlements.
Penang was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945. After the surrender of the Japanese, the British returned and briefly imposed military rule on Malaya before forming the Malayan Union in 1946. During the Malayan Union and the pre-independence Federation of Malaya period, Penang was administered by British Resident Commissioners.
Since independence, the head of state of Penang, the Yang di-Pertua Negeri (also known as Governor), has been appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Yang di-Pertua Negeri retains only ceremonial functions, including opening and dissolving the State Assembly, conferring state awards and appointing the Chief Minister after elections. The Chief Minister is the head of the executive branch of the state government.

Ethiopian Studies

Ethiopian Studies refers to a multi-disciplinary academic cluster dedicated to research on Ethiopia within the cultural and historical context of the Horn of Africa.
Overview.
The classical concept of Ethiopian Studies, developed by European scholars, is based on disciplines like philology and linguistics, history and ethnography. It includes the study of Ethiopian arts and the history and theology of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The classical core of Ethiopian Studies is the philology of the written sources of Christian Ethiopia and Ethio-semitic linguistics. While this approach is still alive and has its role, Ethiopian Studies has opened to a wider concept that tries to avoid a bias in favour of the Christian Abyssinian culture (Amhara, Tigrinya; "cf". Habesha people). It includes the study of the other Afro-Asiatic languages and cultures of Ethiopia besides those of Ethio-semitic derivation; the nation's non-Afro-Asiatic languages and cultures, including the southern Ethiopian cultures; non-Christian faiths, comprising Islam and traditional religions; social and political sciences; as well as contemporary issues like environment and development studies.
Conferences.
Ethiopian Studies scholars congregate at the interdisciplinary International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, a series of gatherings that takes place every three years. Every third conference is held in Ethiopia. The last meeting was in Dire Dawa, 29 Oct. - 2 Nov. 2012. Volumes of proceedings are published after most conferences.
Journals and publications.
Ethiopian Studies is served by a few journals and publications specifically devoted to the field. These include:

The Folk of the Faraway Tree

The Folk of the Faraway Tree is a children's novel in the Faraway Tree series by Enid Blyton. It was first published in 1946.
It is the third book in the series, in which Jo, Bessie and Fanny introduce their mother's friend's daughter, Connie, to Silky, Moonface, Saucepan Man and all the rest of their friends in the Magic Faraway Tree.
At first Connie does not believe such a place exists but she ends up liking the Faraway Tree very much, and is sad to have to leave. Connie is also very snoopy leading to the nickname Curious Connie.
Lands in the book.
It is filled with all kinds of marvels: a cat telling fortunes, a ladder with no top, even a singing tree. Connie goes here, gives the fortune-telling cat a slap, gets in trouble with an old dame, and hides up the ladder with no top where she is rescued by Moonface.
This is the land Jack's beanstalk led to. The children, Saucepan, Silky and Moonface go through here to rescue Connie.
All nursery rhyme people live here. The children all go up to visit Miss Muffet. They have to rescue Saucepan from her spider.
Where Dame Slap has a school for bad pixies and fairies. The friends go to visit Mrs Saucepan and get caught by Dame Slap.
A place for tea parties, with rabbit waiters. It is connected to Dame Slap's land. They all celebrate Mrs Saucepan's birthday here. 
In this land there is a hill with three doors in its side. People visit this land to find out anything they wish to know. The three doors have three different names on them. The names represent three different know-alls who can answer everyone's questions.
Plot summary.
Jo, Bessie and Fanny (or Joe, Beth and Frannie) have Connie over to stay because her mother is sick. Connie is stuck up and bossy and does not believe in magic. She says that Dick (or Rick) told her all about his stay in the country. The children are overwhelmed because it does not seem like Dick/Rick to tell stories. She calls the Enchanted Wood silly, the Faraway Tree ridiculous, Moonface, Dame Washalot and Mr Watizisname stupid, Saucepan Man mad and says that magic is made up and old fashioned. The three children get mad at her for calling their friends rude names and old fashioned. 
After she arrives, Moonface comes. Connie does not believe that Moonface is real so he tells her to think that it is a dream. Connie soon believes them and has a wonderful time in the country. She then regrets that she has to leave.
They have a wonderful time with Connie although she does lead to trouble like going up to the Land of Marvels and climbing up the Ladder That Has No Top. Good thing Moonface saves her. Another time she listens to some else's secret in the Land of Secrets. Mrs Hidden takes away her voice and the children have to get it back. Luckily, the Land of Enchantments comes after The Land of Secrets leaves. Lastly, Connie's third mistake is mistaking Dame Slap (or Snap) for Mrs Saucepan (Saucepan's mother, who is the cook at Dame Slap's school). In the end, they all have to join Dame Slap's school except Fanny and Bessie who have to help out in the kitchen because Mrs Saucepan quits when Saucepan arrives. They are rescued by Saucepan who arrived earlier and was walking around with his mother.

Risen (video game)

Risen is a single-player fantasy-themed action role-playing game by the German company Piranha Bytes, and published by Deep Silver. 
Development.
Piranha Bytes itself developed the Windows version, which was released on October 2, 2009, along with the European version of the Xbox 360 port. The Xbox 360 port was outsourced to an experienced external console team under the close supervision of Piranha Bytes.
After the last official patch, version 1.10, an unofficial patch v1.30 by the fan community was created to address remaining issues.
Plot.
"Risen" takes place in Faranga, a fictitious volcanic, mediterranean island with different sub-climates and vegetation zones. The island is inhabited by humans, as well as many fantasy creatures.
Recently, ancient temple ruins have risen from the ground, providing access to a network of interconnected underground areas such as catacombs and dungeons. As a result, the humans have put in place an Inquisition, forbidding anyone from exiting their city or the island.
In the intro cinematic the player's main, nameless character and a gypsy named Sara can be seen sneaking around on a small ship in the middle of stormy seas. As they get to deck, they see the Inquisitor, calling out to a Titan in the seas. The giant Titan rises through the waves, shrieking at the Inquisitor. The Inquisitor tries to battle the creature, but he realizes that the battle is lost and teleports off of the boat. Seconds later the Titan smashes the boat into little bits, sending Sara and the unnamed protagonist into the depths. The player character wakes up on the shores of Faranga in the midst of the storm, surrounded by dead bodies. Both he and Sara are unharmed.
After exploring the island and meeting other people, the player can choose a faction with which to align. Don Esteban (a group of bandits which had previously controlled the island until the Inquisition exiled them from town), the Inquisition (a group of soldiers who have come to the island in order to explore the mysteries of the rising ruins), or the Mages (the former protectors of the island, now commanded by the Inquisition). Soon after, the player becomes involved with the plans of the High Inquisitor Mendoza, who has discovered a temple leading into the heart of the volcano. He plans to gain access to it, but requires the assistance of the main character in finding five Crystal Disks, which function as keys for the temple.
Once the player has gathered the five Disks, which had been scattered across the island, the Inquisition enters the Volcano Keep. There, it is discovered that a legendary Titan, along with the Titan Lord Ursegor (a Saurian king who had sought to control the power of the titans), have been imprisoned. It is revealed that Faranga has been protected by storms because of the Titan's presence, while the mainland has been ravaged by the other Titans, which were set free when the Gods were exiled by humanity. Inquisitor Mendoza seeks to gain control of the Fire Titan inside the volcano in order to defeat the other Titans. In removing the Titan from its prison, Faranga would become vulnerable to the mystical storms and would effectively be sacrificed for the sake of humanity.
After releasing Ursegor from the curse which tethered his spirit to his corpse in the Volcano Keep, the player sets out to find the Titan Lord's armor pieces, so that he can gain access to the Fire Titan and defeat Mendoza. The armor pieces were sealed in the ruins with some undead priests. The player explores the risen ruins, retrieves the armor, and enters the Volcano Keep behind Mendoza. Mendoza turns mad and is defeated by the player. After that, the player banishes the Fire Titan after defeating him in battle.
The ending suggests that Faranga has been spared from destruction, but that four more Titans continue to ravage the mainland. After the credits roll, dialogue between the main character and Patty, the daughter of an infamous pirate, suggests that the two will travel to the mainland to fight the Titans in the sequel.
Gameplay.
The game features a combat system with parries, blocks, and sidesteps. Using this system the player can utilize a wide array of weapons like swords, bows, or fighting staffs. Alternatively, the player can choose to play as a mage, combination of mage and fighter, or a pure fighter with limited access to magic through single-use scrolls.
Many skills are not available directly at the start of the game and have to be unlocked by expending "learning points" in the chosen skill. In addition to direct gameplay changes, unlocking skills has other minor aesthetic effects such as the player character using a different stance during combat. The game also has a system for professions and abilities, such as smithing and lock picking which are leveled up in the same way as the weapon skills—by expending points to level up in the specific profession.
Quests conversations are fully logged in a quest diary. Maps are available, along with "quest maps" on which objectives are marked. Non-player characters are voiced in English.
"Risen" has smaller areas that can't be accessed until later. Creatures do not respawn in the first part of the game, but do so in later parts. The island is also said to contain easter eggs.
An IGN reviewer wrote that "Risen" resembles the "Gothic" games in "the general ambiance of the world[,] the presentation, feel of gameplay, and style of exploration" but is more "user-friendly" than the "more hardcore Gothic games".
Marketing and promotion.
Deep Silver released several trailers for the game online. The first cinematic trailer was produced in 2008 by Virgin Lands. The following cinematic teaser (which features portions of the Nightwish song "The Poet and the Pendulum") and the intro cinematic were produced in 2009 by Lemonaut Creations.
A demo entitled "The Risen Experience" can be played online on the official "Risen" website.
Censorship.
On July 20, 2009, "Risen" was refused classification in Australia by the OFLC. According to the game's Australian distributor, Madman Interactive, the OFLC cited "sexual activity and drug use related to incentives or rewards" as the reason for the refusal.
Reception.
"Risen" received generally favorable reviews, with aggregate scores on GameRankings and Metacritic reaching 77.57% and 77/100 for the Windows version and 63.44% and 60/100 for the Xbox 360 version.
PC Zone gave the PC version an 85/100, concluding that "Risen is a solid, engrossing and beautifully presented RPG that's well worth your time and money".
IGN gave the PC version an 8.6/10, praising for its hard yet rewarding gameplay, impressive graphics and solid voice acting, yet still pointed to the combat mechanics being messy while fighting hordes but mentioned "...you'll get better at it as you bump up your skill with a preferred weapon type and unlock new moves, making the experience even easier, though it never quite feels as natural as it should."
Eurogamer gave the Xbox 360 version a 4/10, noting that "It's something of a tragedy, since there's clearly a really good RPG buried under all this technical mediocrity".
GameZone's Steven Hopper gave the Xbox 360 version 7/10, saying "Risen is a solid game brought down by a shoddy port to consoles. While there’s still a lot of fun to be had with the deep missions that foster exploration, the game’s technical presentation is subpar and there are some gameplay issues as a result of the move to the Xbox 360."
Xbox Evolved's Michael Ogunnubi gave the Xbox 360 version of the game 8 out of 10, saying "I highly recommend Risen to players who enjoyed the heck out of somewhat obscure titles like Gothic 1 and 2, , and Avernum, or to those who enjoyed Bethesda's brief experiment in 3D adventure gaming known as , or finally to those who grew up addicted to highly interactive classics like Ultima VII."
Sequel.
"" was released for Microsoft Windows in Europe and United States at the end of April 2012 and for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 platforms in July/August 2012.
"" was officially revealed on the cover of the German "PC Games" magazine.

Taibo of Wu

Taibo (Chinese: t , s , p "Tàibó") was the eldest son of King Tai of Zhou and the legendary founder of the State of Wu. His birth and death dates are unknown.
Biography.
Born into the Ji clan () of Zhou, he had two younger brothers, Zhongyong and Jili. The King of Zhou wished to make Jili, who had become renowned for his wisdom, his heir. Taibo fled to Jin and Jili became King Ji. His son Chang later became King Wen. Taibo and Zhongyong settled in Meili in present-day Jiangsu province.
Taibo made Meili his capital, after which it is said that he ordered the Canal Du to be dug. During his reign, Taibo also developed irrigation and encouraged agriculture. When Taibo died, he had no heir and passed the throne to his younger brother Zhongyong. Taibo's shrine was set up in today's Meicun, although the original wood structure was destroyed during later wars. It has been renovated several times and today's architecture is mostly from Qing dynasty. A stone carved with Confucius's comment can still be seen in today's Taibo Shrine.
Much later, when King Wu had ended the Shang dynasty, he made Zhouzhang a descendant of Zhongyong the king of Wu.
Diplomatic visits to Japan by the later Wei and Jin dynasties recorded that the Wō people of Japan claimed to be descendants of Taibo.

Morgan Philips Price (29 January 1885 – 23 September 1973) was a British politician and a Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP).
He was born in The Grove, Taynton, near Gloucester. His father, William Edwin Price, was also a British MP, serving for the seat of Tewkesbury. M. Philips Price was schooled at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. When his father died in 1906, Price inherited an estate of some .
Journalistic career.
His political life began as a member of the Liberal Party, and he was selected as a prospective party candidate for Gloucester (1911–14). However, he took an anti-war stance at the outbreak of the Great War joining the anti-war Union of Democratic Control at its inception. In 1914, he also published "The Diplomatic History of the War".
He was then recruited by C.P. Scott of the Manchester Guardian, and became a war correspondent for the Eastern Front. As a Russian speaker, he was subsequently able to observe and report on the Russian Revolution. In 1921, he returned to Britain and published "My Reminiscences of the Russian Revolution" which showed sympathy to the government of Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks.
Price was later employed by the Daily Herald as a correspondent in German from 1919–23.
Parliament.
After the First World War, Price joined the Labour Party, and became its candidate for the Gloucester seat. He fought the seat at the general elections in 1922, 1923 and 1924 but was never successful. At the 1929 general election, he was finally elected to parliament for the Whitehaven constituency. He joined Ramsay MacDonald's government when appointed as Private Secretary to Charles Trevelyan, president of the Board of Education.
At the 1931 general election Price lost his seat. However, he returned to Parliament in 1935, as member for the Forest of Dean which he served until the constituency was abolished in boundary changes for the 1950 general election. He was elected instead for the new West Gloucestershire constituency, and held that seat until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1959 general election.
He published his memoirs, "My Three Revolutions", in 1969, and died on 23 September 1973.

The Maid of Orleans (poem)

The Maiden of Orleans () is a satirical poem by François-Marie Arouet, better known by his pen name, Voltaire. It was first properly published in 1899, but Voltaire had written it over a century beforehand; while he had started writing the text in 1730, he never fully completed it. It was translated into English by W. H. Ireland.
Scandal.
Voltaire was undoubtedly one of the most controversial writers and philosophers of the Enlightenment Age, and "The Maid of Orleans" was also certainly one of his more contentious works. An epic and scandalous satire concerning the life of the not-yet-canonised Joan of Arc ("the Maid of Orleans"), the poem was outlawed, burned and banned throughout a great portion of Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. Containing mockery and satirical commentary on the life and antics of its subject, the poem itself has variously been described as "bawdy" and "licentious".
Despite the often sexist and indecent contents of the text, its notoriety and contraband status made it one of the most widely read texts concerning Joan of Arc for several centuries. Circulating throughout the banned regions by often surreptitious means, the book was read by a large number of the populace. It was also disseminated by Voltaire himself to some of his colleagues and other members of the upper class, the circle of people and the portion of society that the text was specifically intended for.
Writing.
Various sources report that Voltaire resolved to write "The Maid of Orleans" after a literary colleague challenged him to compose a better analysis of the Joan of Arc subject than the treatment Jean Chapelain had produced in his "The Maid, or the Heroic Poem of France Delivered". Published in the mid-17th century, Chapelain's poem was a lengthy and philosophical discussion of the topic. While Chapelain's poem was much awaited by followers of his work, it was savaged by critics, and Voltaire made sure to include his own lampoon of Chapelain's work in his own take on Joan of Arc:
After the degree of criticism the poem was receiving for its sexual undertones and supposedly perverted nature, Voltaire in public became ashamed of his work, even to the point that he asserted that the transcript had been somehow corrupted and tainted and was therefore inauthentic. He published an edited edition of the text over thirty years later, in 1762. This later variant omitted many of the themes and textual content for which the original content had been so scorned.

Chastreix-Sancy

Chastreix-Sancy is a small ski resort situated above the village of Chastreix in central France. The resort is the smallest of the three main resorts situated in the Monts Dore and has no skiable link to the other two resorts. The main activities offered at the resort are alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, ski touring, dog sledding and hiking. It is a calm resort popular with families and locals, as it boasts gentle runs, panoramic views and short queues.
Geography.
The resort is situated at an altitude of 1400m in the Monts Dore mountain range within the Massif Central, built on and between the Puy de Chabane and Mont Redon, on the west side of the Puy de Sancy, which is part of an ancient stratovolcano which has been dormant for 220,000 years. It is within the Parc naturel régional des volcans d'Auvergne and the commune of Chastreix in the Puy-de-Dôme "département" of the Auvergne "région". It is about 40 km south west of the "préfecture" of the Puy-de-Dôme "département" Clermont-Ferrand, also capital of the Auvergne. The resort is sandwiched between the Cirque de la Fontaine Salée to the south-east and the Val d'Enfer, or Valley of Hell in English, to the north-east. Both of these have left the resort with no formal links to the other two resorts in the Massif du Sancy ski area.
Lift system.
Les Carrières 1 & 2.
Les Carrières 1 & 2 are a pair of green button lifts used primarily by beginners to access the two green runs, Les Carrières and Les Marmottes, that start from their top stations during the winter season. They were built by Gimar Montaz Mautino with a gap of 16 years between their respective constructions, with Les Carrières 1 being built first in 1969 and Les Carrières 2 being built afterwards in 1985. They both follow the same route with their pylons similarly spaced along the lines, and both have the motor placed at the bottom station, at an elevation of 1406m, and the tension applied at the top station, at an elevation of 1466m, with a vertical gain of 60m and a length of 402m. However their differences are that, due to the terrain, Les Carrières 2 has a slightly steeper maximum slope at 22% rather than the 20% of Les Carrières 1. In addition, with Les Carrières 2 being newer, it is faster. Les Carrières 2 has an operating speed of 3.6 m/s and a throughput of 900 people per hour, compared with the slower 3.5 m/s operating speed and 600 people per hour throughput of Les Carrières 1. Both the motors spin so that the passengers travel to the right of the pylons on their upwards journey.

Jordan 191

The Jordan 191 was the first Formula One car built by Jordan Grand Prix and participated in the 1991 Formula One season. The car was designed by a team of three staff led by chief designer Gary Anderson. Five drivers took part in the sixteen round championship for the team. Andrea de Cesaris was the only one to drive the full season, despite failing to pre-qualify for the opening round of the championship in Phoenix. It was also de Cesaris who scored the team's best finish of the season, with a fourth place at both Montreal and at Mexico City. Bertrand Gachot secured his best finish of his shortened season, with a fifth place - just over 2 seconds behind de Cesaris at the finish. Gachot's season was curtailed by a two-month prison sentence, for spraying CS gas at a taxi driver in London.
Over the final six races, three drivers filled in for Gachot - Alessandro Zanardi, Roberto Moreno and Michael Schumacher. Schumacher was a revelation in his one and only race weekend for Jordan. At the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher qualified a superb seventh on the grid (Jordan's joint-best ever at that time), outqualifying de Cesaris who was eleventh. However, the high did not last, as the clutch failed within the first mile of the race. There followed a legal wrangle between Benetton and Jordan, with Schumacher signing for Benetton - a team with which he would later win two world championships - sending Moreno packing from Benetton and Jordan signed him up. He did two races before handing another debutant, Zanardi, his debut in the final three races. A pair of ninths were the best results that any of Gachot's replacements achieved.
In their first season, Jordan finished an impressive fifth in the championship, scoring 13 points along the way. The 191 is also considered by many to be one of the most beautiful Formula 1 cars of all time. The car won the Autosport Racing Car of the Year award for 1991.

Rugard

The Rugard, at , is the highest elevation in the central region of the German Baltic Sea island of Rügen. This push end moraine was formed in the last ice age and lies on the northeastern perimeter of the town of Bergen auf Rügen.
There was probably a castle here from the 9th century to the year 1325 A.D., in which princes of the Slavic Rani tribe resided. These princes ruled Rügen and parts of the adjacent mainland. The Slavic name "Rugard" (German: "Rujanenburg") dates to that period. The site had an inner and outer ward and covered an area of 2.3 hectares.
When the Rani's princely line ended in 1325 with the death of Wizlaw III, the castle lost its importance and fell into disrepair. Some of its ramparts have survived, however, and may still be made out today. In the Middle Ages there was a mill here and the area was used for agriculture. Until 1830, when Prince Wilhelm Malte I of Putbus (1783-1854) had the ramparts reforested, the Rugard was treeless. Karl Friedrich Schinkel captured its former appearance in his 1821 painting "Der Rugard auf Rügen" ("The Rugard on Rügen").
Over time, a forest grew up, consisting mainly of spruce and pine trees, interrupted by small stands of oak, birch and poplar as well as many other deciduous and coniferous trees. The native beech is barely represented. In 1984, a 2.5 km nature trail was established that runs through the Rugard Forest ("Rugardwald") where visitors are able to learn about the variety of animal and plant life in this historic countryside from the various information boards.
From the Ernst Moritz Arndt Tower on the top of the Rugard, visitors have a panoramic view over the entire island. This tower was built in the 1870s as a monument to Ernst Moritz Arndt, who was born in Groß Schoritz on Rügen. The foundation stone was laid on 26 December 1869, the 100th anniversary of the poet. They chose a design by Berlin architect and builder, Hermann Eggert and began construction in Autumn 1872. However, the work was not completed until 1877 due to a lack of money. In the 1930s the forest around the Rugard reached such a height that there was no longer a clear, all-round view from the topmost gallery of the tower. Between 1935 and 1937, a Nazi "Thingplatz" was built here, which was mainly used by the Hitler Youth.
During thorough renovations carried out from 2000 to 2002, it was decided to replace the 1955 wooden dome with a dome of glass and steel (whilst maintaining its historical shape) and thus provide a higher viewing platform.

Planar separator theorem

In graph theory, the planar separator theorem is a form of isoperimetric inequality for planar graphs, that states that any planar graph can be split into smaller pieces by removing a small number of vertices. Specifically, the removal of O(√"n") vertices from an "n"-vertex graph (where the "O" invokes big O notation) can partition the graph into disjoint subgraphs each of which has at most 2"n"/3 vertices.
A weaker form of the separator theorem with O(√"n" log "n") vertices in the separator instead of O(√"n") was originally proven by , and the form with the tight asymptotic bound on the separator size was first proven by . Since their work, the separator theorem has been reproven in several different ways, the constant in the O(√"n") term of the theorem has been improved, and it has been extended to certain classes of nonplanar graphs.
Repeated application of the separator theorem produces a separator hierarchy which may take the form of either a tree decomposition or a branch-decomposition of the graph. Separator hierarchies may be used to devise efficient divide and conquer algorithms for planar graphs, and dynamic programming on these hierarchies can be used to devise exponential time and fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for solving NP-hard optimization problems on these graphs. Separator hierarchies may also be used in nested dissection, an efficient variant of Gaussian elimination for solving sparse systems of linear equations arising from finite element methods.
Statement of the theorem.
As it is usually stated, the separator theorem states that, in any "n"-vertex planar graph "G" = ("V","E"), there exists a partition of the vertices of "G" into three sets "A", "S", and "B", such that each of "A" and "B" has at most 2"n"/3 vertices, "S" has O(√"n") vertices, and there are no edges with one endpoint in "A" and one endpoint in "B". It is not required that "A" or "B" form connected subgraphs of "G". "S" is called the separator for this partition.
An equivalent formulation is that the edges of any "n"-vertex planar graph "G" may be subdivided into two edge-disjoint subgraphs "G"1 and "G"2 in such a way that both subgraphs have at least "n"/3 vertices and such that the intersection of the vertex sets of the two subgraphs has O(√"n") vertices in it. Such a partition is known as a separation. If a separation is given, then the intersection of the vertex sets forms a separator, and the vertices that belong to one subgraph but not the other form the separated subsets of at most 2"n"/3 vertices. In the other direction, if one is given a partition into three sets "A", "S", and "B" that meet the conditions of the planar separator theorem, then one may form a separation in which the edges with an endpoint in "A" belong to "G"1, the edges with an endpoint in "B" belong to "G"2, and the remaining edges (with both endpoints in "S") are partitioned arbitrarily.
The constant 2/3 in the statement of the separator theorem is arbitrary and may be replaced by any other number in the open interval (1/2,1) without changing the form of the theorem: a partition into more equal subsets may be obtained from a less-even partition by repeatedly splitting the larger sets in the uneven partition and regrouping the resulting connected components.
Example.
Consider a grid graph with "r" rows and "c" columns; the number "n" of vertices equals "rc". For instance, in the illustration, "r" = 5, "c" = 8, and "n" = 40. If "r" is odd, there is a single central row, and otherwise there are two rows equally close to the center; similarly, if "c" is odd, there is a single central column, and otherwise there are two columns equally close to the center. Choosing "S" to be any of these central rows or columns, and removing "S" from the graph, partitions the graph into two smaller connected subgraphs "A" and "B", each of which has at most "n"/2 vertices. If "r" ≤ "c" (as in the illustration), then choosing a central column will give a separator "S" with "r" ≤ √"n" vertices, and similarly if "c" ≤ "r" then choosing a central row will give a separator with at most √"n" vertices. Thus, every grid graph has a separator "S" of size at most √"n", the removal of which partitions it into two connected components, each of size at most "n"/2.
The planar separator theorem states that a similar partition can be constructed in any planar graph. The case of arbitrary planar graphs differs from the case of grid graphs in that the separator has size O(√"n") but may be larger than √"n", the bound on the size of the two subsets "A" and "B" (in the most common versions of the theorem) is 2"n"/3 rather than "n"/2, and the two subsets "A" and "B" need not themselves form connected subgraphs.
Constructions.
Breadth-first layering.
This proof of the separator theorem applies as well to weighted planar graphs, in which each vertex has a non-negative cost. The graph may be partitioned into three sets "A", "S", and "B" such that "A" and "B" each have at most 2/3 of the total cost and "S" has O(√"n") vertices, with no edges from "A" to "B". By analysing a similar separator construction more carefully, shows that the bound on the size of "S" can be reduced to √6√"n", or approximately 2.45√"n".
Simple cycle separators.
For a graph that is already maximal planar it is possible to show a stronger construction of a simple cycle separator, a cycle of small length such that the inside and the outside of the cycle (in the unique planar embedding of the graph) each have at most 2"n"/3 vertices. proves this (with a separator size of √8√"n") by using the Lipton–Tarjan technique for a modified version of breadth first search in which the levels of the search form simple cycles.
Circle separators.
According to the Koebe–Andreev–Thurston circle-packing theorem, any planar graph may be represented by a packing of circular disks in the plane with disjoint interiors, such that two vertices in the graph are adjacent if and only if the corresponding pair of disks are mutually tangent. As show, for such a packing, there exists a circle that has at most 3"n"/4 disks touching or inside it, at most 3"n"/4 disks touching or outside it, and that crosses O(√"n" disks).
To prove this, Miller et al. use stereographic projection to map the packing onto the surface of a unit sphere in three dimensions. By choosing the projection carefully, the center of the sphere can be made into a centerpoint of the disk centers on its surface, so that any plane through the center of the sphere partitions it into two halfspaces that each contain or cross at most 3"n"/4 of the disks. If a plane through the center is chosen uniformly at random, a disk will be crossed with probability proportional to its radius. Therefore, the expected number of disks that are crossed is proportional to the sum of the radii of the disks. However, the sum of the squares of the radii is proportional to the total area of the disks, which is at most the total surface area of the unit sphere, a constant. An argument involving Jensen's inequality shows that, when the sum of squares of "n" non-negative real numbers is bounded by a constant, the sum of the numbers themselves is O(√"n"). Therefore, the expected number of disks crossed by a random plane is O(√"n") and there exists a plane that crosses at most that many disks. This plane intersects the sphere in a great circle, which projects back down to a circle in the plane with the desired properties. The O(√"n") disks crossed by this circle correspond to the vertices of a planar graph separator that separates the vertices whose disks are inside the circle from the vertices whose disks are outside the circle, with at most 3"n"/4 vertices in each of these two subsets.
This method leads to a randomized algorithm that finds such a separator in linear time, and a less-practical deterministic algorithm with the same linear time bound. By analyzing this algorithm carefully using known bounds on the packing density of circle packings, it can be shown to find separators of size at most
Although this improved separator size bound comes at the expense of a more-uneven partition of the graph, argue that it provides an improved constant factor in the time bounds for nested dissection compared to the separators of . The size of the separators it produces can be further improved, in practice, by using a nonuniform distribution for the random cutting planes.
The stereographic projection in the Miller et al. argument can be avoided by considering the smallest circle containing a constant fraction of the centers of the disks and then expanding it by a constant picked uniformly in the range [1,2]. It is easy to argue, as in Miller et al., that the disks intersecting the expanded circle form a valid separator, and that, in expectation, the separator is of the right size. The resulting constants are somewhat worse.
Spectral partitioning.
Spectral clustering methods, in which the vertices of a graph are grouped by the coordinates of the eigenvectors of matrices derived from the graph, have long been used as a heuristic for graph partitioning problems for nonplanar graphs. As show, spectral clustering can also be used to derive an alternative proof for a weakened form of the planar separator theorem that applies to planar graphs with bounded degree. In their method, the vertices of a given planar graph are sorted by the second coordinates of the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, and this sorted order is partitioned at the point that minimizes the ratio of the number of edges cut by the partition to the number of vertices on the smaller side of the partition. As they show, every planar graph of bounded degree has a partition of this type in which the ratio is O(1/√"n"). Although this partition may not be balanced, repeating the partition within the larger of the two sides and taking the union of the cuts formed at each repetition will eventually lead to a balanced partition with O(√"n") edges. The endpoints of these edges form a separator of size O(√"n").
Edge separators.
A variation of the planar separator theorem involves edge separators, small sets of edges forming a cut between two subsets "A" and "B" of the vertices of the graph. The two sets "A" and "B" must each have size at most a constant fraction of the number "n" of vertices of the graph (conventionally, both sets have size at most 2"n"/3), and each vertex of the graph belongs to exactly one of "A" and "B". The separator consists of the edges that have one endpoint in "A" and one endpoint in "B". Bounds on the size of an edge separator involve the degree of the vertices as well as the number of vertices in the graph: the planar graphs in which one vertex has degree "n" − 1, including the wheel graphs and star graphs, have no edge separator with a sublinear number of edges, because any edge separator would have to include all the edges connecting the high degree vertex to the vertices on the other side of the cut. However, every planar graph with maximum degree Δ has an edge separator of size O(√(Δ"n")).
A simple cycle separator in the dual graph of a planar graph forms an edge separator in the original graph.
Applying the simple cycle separator theorem of to the dual graph of a given planar graph strengthens the O(√(Δ"n")) bound for the size of an edge separator by showing that every planar graph has an edge separator whose size is proportional to the Euclidean norm of its vector of vertex degrees.
Lower bounds.
In a √"n" × √"n" grid graph, a set "S" of "s" < √"n" points can enclose a subset of at most "s"("s" − 1)/2 grid points, where the maximum is achieved by arranging "S" in a diagonal line near a corner of the grid. Therefore, in order to form a separator that separates at least "n"/3 of the points from the remaining grid, "s" needs to be at least √(2"n"/3), approximately 0.82√"n".
There exist "n"-vertex planar graphs (for arbitrarily large values of "n") such that, for every separator "S" that partitions the remaining graph into subgraphs of at most 2"n"/3 vertices, "S" has at least √(4π√3)√"n" vertices, approximately 1.56√"n". The construction involves approximating a sphere by a convex polyhedron, replacing each of the faces of the polyhedron by a triangular mesh, and applying isoperimetric theorems for the surface of the sphere.
Separator hierarchies.
Separators may be combined into a separator hierarchy of a planar graph, a recursive decomposition into smaller graphs. A separator hierarchy may be represented by a binary tree in which the root node represents the given graph itself, and the two children of the root are the roots of recursively constructed separator hierarchies for the induced subgraphs formed from the two subsets "A" and "B" of a separator.
A separator hierarchy of this type forms the basis for a tree decomposition of the given graph, in which the set of vertices associated with each tree node is the union of the separators on the path from that node to the root of the tree. Since the sizes of the graphs go down by a constant factor at each level of the tree, the upper bounds on the sizes of the separators also go down by a constant factor at each level, so the sizes of the separators on these paths add in a geometric series to O(√"n"). That is, a separator formed in this way has width O(√"n"), and can be used to show that every planar graph have treewidth O(√"n").
Constructing a separator hierarchy directly, by traversing the binary tree top down and applying a linear-time planar separator algorithm to each of the induced subgraphs associated with each node of the binary tree, would take a total of O("n" log "n") time. However, it is possible to construct an entire separator hierarchy in linear time, by using the Lipton–Tarjan breadth-first layering approach and by using appropriate data structures to perform each partition step in sublinear time.
If one forms a related type of hierarchy based on separations instead of separators, in which the two children of the root node are roots of recursively constructed hierarchies for the two subgraphs "G"1 and "G"2 of a separation of the given graph, then the overall structure forms a branch-decomposition instead of a tree decomposition. The width of any separation in this decomposition is, again, bounded by the sum of the sizes of the separators on a path from any node to the root of the hierarchy, so any branch-decomposition formed in this way has width O(√"n") and any planar graph has branchwidth O(√"n"). Although many other related graph partitioning problems are NP-complete, even for planar graphs, it is possible to find a minimum-width branch-decomposition of a planar graph in polynomial time.
By applying methods of more directly in the construction of branch-decompositions, show that every planar graph has branchwidth at most 2.12√"n", with the same constant as the one in the simple cycle separator theorem of Alon et al. Since the treewidth of any graph is at most 3/2 its branchwidth, this also shows that planar graphs have treewidth at most 3.18√"n".
Other classes of graphs.
Some sparse graphs do not have separators of sublinear size: in an expander graph, deleting up to a constant fraction of the vertices still leaves only one connected component.
Possibly the earliest known separator theorem is a result of that any tree can be partitioned into subtrees of at most 2"n"/3 vertices each by the removal of a single vertex. In particular, the vertex that minimizes the maximum component size has this property, for if it did not then its neighbor in the unique large subtree would form an even better partition. By applying the same technique to a tree decomposition of an arbitrary graph, it is possible to show that any graph has a separator of size at most equal to its treewidth.
If a graph "G" is not planar, but can be embedded on a surface of genus "g", then it has a separator with O(("gn")1/2) vertices. prove this by using a similar approach to that of . They group the vertices of the graph into breadth-first levels and find two levels the removal of which leaves at most one large component consisting of a small number of levels. This remaining component can be made planar by removing a number of breadth-first paths proportional to the genus, after which the Lipton–Tarjan method can be applied to the remaining planar graph. The result follows from a careful balancing of the size of the removed two levels against the number of levels between them. If the graph embedding is given as part of the input, its separator can be found in linear time. Graphs of genus "g" also have edge separators of size O(("g"Δ"n")1/2).
Graphs of bounded genus form an example of a family of graphs closed under the operation of taking minors, and separator theorems also apply to arbitrary minor-closed graph families. In particular, if a graph family has a forbidden minor with "h" vertices, then it has a separator with O("h"√"n") vertices, and such a separator can be found in time O("n"1 + ε) for any ε > 0.
The circle separator method of generalizes to the intersection graphs of any system of "d"-dimensional balls with the property that any point in space is covered by at most some constant number "k" of balls, to "k"-nearest-neighbor graphs in "d" dimensions, and to the graphs arising from finite element meshes. The sphere separators constructed in this way partition the input graph into subgraphs of at most vertices. The size of the separators for "k"-ply ball intersection graphs and for "k"-nearest-neighbor graphs is O("k"1/"d""n"1 − 1/"d").
Applications.
Divide and conquer algorithms.
Separator decompositions can be of use in designing efficient divide and conquer algorithms for solving problems on planar graphs. As an example, one problem that can be solved in this way is to find the shortest cycle in a weighted planar digraph. This may be solved by the following steps:
The time for the two recursive calls to "A" and "B" in this algorithm is dominated by the time to perform the O(√"n") calls to Dijkstra's algorithm, so this algorithm finds the shortest cycle in O("n"3/2 log "n") time.
A faster algorithm for the same shortest cycle problem, running in time O("n" log3"n"), was given by . His algorithm uses the same separator-based divide and conquer structure, but uses simple cycle separators rather than arbitrary separators, so that the vertices of "S" belong to a single face of the graphs inside and outside the cycle separator. He then replaces the O(√"n") separate calls to Dijkstra's algorithm with more sophisticated algorithms to find shortest paths from all vertices on a single face of a planar graph and to combine the distances from the two subgraphs. For weighted but undirected planar graphs, the shortest cycle is equivalent to the minimum cut in the dual graph and can be found in O("n" log log "n") time, and the shortest cycle in an unweighted undirected planar graph (its girth) may be found in time O("n"). (However, the faster algorithm for unweighted graphs is not based on the separator theorem.)
Frederickson proposed another faster algorithm for single source shortest paths by implementing separator theorem in planar graphs in 1986. This is an improvement of Dijkstra's algorithm with iterative search on a carefully selected subset of the vertices. This version takes O("n" √(log "n")) time in an "n"-vertex graph. Separators are used to find a division of a graph, that is, a partition of the edge-set into two or more subsets, called regions. A node is said to be contained in a region if some edge of the region is incident to the node. A node contained in more that one region is called a boundary node of the regions containing it. The method uses the notion of a "r"-division of an "n"-node graph that is a graph division into O("n"/"r") regions, each containing O("r") nodes including O(√"r") boundary nodes. Frederickson showed that an "r"-division can be found in O("n" log "n") time by recursive application of separator theorem.
The sketch of his algorithm to solve the problem is as follows.
1. Preprocessing Phase: Partition the graph into carefully selected subsets of vertices and determine the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in these subsets, where intermediate vertices on this path are not in the subset. This phase requires a planar graph "G"0  to be transformed into "G" with no vertex having degree greater than 3. From a corollary of Euler's formula, the number of vertices in the resulting graph will be "n" ≤ 6"n"0 -12, where "n"0  is the number of vertices in "G"0 . This phase also ensures the following properties of a suitable "r"-division. A suitable "r"-division of a planar graph is an "r"-division such that,
2. Search Phase:
Henzinger et. al. extended Frederickson's "r"-division technique for the single source shortest path algorithm in planar graphs for nonnegative edge-lengths and proposed a linear time algorithm. Their method generalizes Frederickson's notion of graph-divisions such that now an ("r","s")-division of an "n"-node graph be a division into O("n"/"r") regions, each containing "r"{O(1)}  nodes, each having at most "s" boundary nodes. If an ("r", "s")-division is repeatedly divided into smaller regions, that is called get a recursive division. This algorithm uses approximately log*"n" levels of divisions. The recursive division is represented by a rooted tree whose leaves are labeled by distinct edge of "G". The root of the tree represents the region consisting of full-"G", the children of the root represent the subregions into which that region is divided and so on. Each leaf (atomic region) represents a region containing exactly one edge.
Nested dissection is a separator based divide and conquer variation of Gaussian elimination for solving sparse symmetric systems of linear equations with a planar graph structure, such as the ones arising from the finite element method. It involves finding a separator for the graph describing the system of equations, recursively eliminating the variables in the two subproblems separated from each other by the separator, and then eliminating the variables in the separator. The fill-in of this method (the number of nonzero coefficients of the resulting Cholesky decomposition of the matrix) is O("n" log "n"), allowing this method to be competitive with iterative methods for the same problems.
Klein, Mozes and Weimann gave an O("n" log2 "n")-time, linear-space algorithm to find the shortest path distances from "s" to all nodes for a directed planar graph with positive and negative arc-lengths containing no negative cycles. Their algorithm uses planar graph separators to find a Jordan curve "C" that passes through O(√"n") nodes (and no arcs) such that between "n"/3 and 2"n"/3 nodes are enclosed by "C". Nodes through which "C" passes are boundary nodes. The original graph "G" is separated into two subgraphs "G"0  and "G"1  by cutting the planar embedding along "C" and duplicating the boundary nodes. For "i" = 0 and 1, in "G"i  the boundary nodes lie on the boundary of a single face "F"i .
The overview of their approach is given below. 
An important part of this algorithm is the use of Price Functions and Reduced Lengths. For a directed graph "G" with arc-lengths ι(·), a price function is a function φ from the nodes of "G" to the real numbers. For an arc "uv", the reduced length with respect to φ is ιφ("uv") = ι("uv") + φ("u") − φ("v"). A feasible price function is a price function that induces nonnegative reduced lengths on all arcs of "G". It is useful in transforming a shortest-path problem involving positive and negative lengths into one involving only nonnegative lengths, which can then be solved using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
The separator based divide and conquer paradigm has also been used to design data structures for dynamic graph algorithms and point location, algorithms for polygon triangulation, shortest paths, and the construction of nearest neighbor graphs, and approximation algorithms for the maximum independent set of a planar graph.
Exact solution of NP-hard optimization problems.
By using dynamic programming on a tree decomposition or branch-decomposition of a planar graph, many NP-hard optimization problems may be solved in time exponential in √"n" or √"n" log "n". For instance, bounds of this form are known for finding maximum independent sets, Steiner trees, and Hamiltonian cycles, and for solving the travelling salesman problem on planar graphs. Similar methods involving separator theorems for geometric graphs may be used to solve Euclidean travelling salesman problem and Steiner tree construction problems in time bounds of the same form.
For parameterized problems that admit a kernelization that preserves planarity and reduces the input graph to a kernel of size linear in the input parameter, this approach can be used to design fixed-parameter tractable algorithms the running time of which depends polynomially on the size of the input graph and exponentially on √"k", where "k" is the parameter of the algorithm. For instance, time bounds of this form are known for finding vertex covers and dominating sets of size "k".
Approximation algorithms.
Similar separator-based approximation schemes have also been used to approximate other hard problems such as vertex cover. use separators in a different way to approximate the travelling salesman problem for the shortest path metric on weighted planar graphs; their algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the shortest tour that, at each level of a separator hierarchy, crosses the separator a bounded number of times, and they show that as the crossing bound increases the tours constructed in this way have lengths that approximate the optimal tour.
Graph compression.
Separators have been used as part of data compression algorithms for representing planar graphs and other separable graphs using a small number of bits. The basic principle of these algorithms is to choose a number "k" and repeatedly subdivide the given planar graph using separators into O("n"/"k") subgraphs of size at most "k", with O("n"/√"k") vertices in the separators. With an appropriate choice of "k" (at most proportional to the logarithm of "n") the number of non-isomorphic "k"-vertex planar subgraphs is significantly less than the number of subgraphs in the decomposition, so the graph can be compressed by constructing a table of all the possible non-isomorphic subgraphs and representing each subgraph in the separator decomposition by its index into the table. The remainder of the graph, formed by the separator vertices, may be represented explicitly or by using a recursive version of the same data structure. Using this method, planar graphs and many more restricted families of planar graphs may be encoded using a number of bits that is information-theoretically optimal: if there are "Pn" "n"-vertex graphs in the family of graphs to be represented, then an individual graph in the family can be represented using only (1 + o("n"))log2"Pn" bits. It is also possible to construct representations of this type in which one may test adjacency between vertices, determine the degree of a vertex, and list neighbors of vertices in constant time per query, by augmenting the table of subgraphs with additional tabular information representing the answers to the queries.
Universal graphs.
A universal graph for a family "F" of graphs is a graph that contains every member of "F" as a subgraphs. Separators can be used to show that the "n"-vertex planar graphs have universal graphs with "n" vertices and O("n"3/2) edges.
The construction involves a strengthened form of the separator theorem in which the size of the three subsets of vertices in the separator does not depend on the graph structure: there exists a number "c", the magnitude of which at most a constant times √"n", such that the vertices of every "n"-vertex planar graph can be separated into subsets "A", "S", and "B", with no edges from "A" to "B", with |"S"| = "c", and with |"A"| = |"B"| = ("n" − "c")/2. This may be shown by using the usual form of the separator theorem repeatedly to partition the graph until all the components of the partition can be arranged into two subsets of fewer than "n"/2 vertices, and then moving vertices from these subsets into the separator as necessary until it has the given size.
Once a separator theorem of this type is shown, it can be used to produce a separator hierarchy for "n"-vertex planar graphs that again does not depend on the graph structure: the tree-decomposition formed from this hierarchy has width O(√"n") and can be used for any planar graph. The set of all pairs of vertices in this tree-decomposition that both belong to a common node of the tree-decomposition forms a trivially perfect graph with O("n"3/2) vertices that contains every "n"-vertex planar graph as a subgraph. A similar construction shows that bounded-degree planar graphs have universal graphs with O("n" log "n") edges, where the constant hidden in the O notation depends on the degree bound. Any universal graph for planar graphs (or even for trees of unbounded degree) must have Ω("n" log "n") edges, but it remains unknown whether this lower bound or the O("n"3/2) upper bound is tight for universal graphs for arbitrary planar graphs.

Heart o' the Hills

"Heart o' the Hills" is a 1919 silent film directed by Joseph De Grasse and Sidney Franklin, written by Bernard McConville and based on a John Fox Jr.'s novel.
Plot.
Jason Honeycutt (Harold Goodwin) is a young boy who lives with his stepfather chief Steve Honeycutt (Sam De Grasse) at the ancestral Honeycutt's home. One day the chief is looking for the 13-year-old mountain girl Mavis Hawn (Mary Pickford), who is shooting bullets in the woods. Mavis desires for revenge after a few gang members attack her home and shot and killed her father. One of her only friends is geologist and school teacher John Burnham (Fred Warren). He suggests her to get an education instead of teaching herself to use a gun.
Chief Honeycutt visits Mavis' widowed mother Martha Hawn (Claire McDowell) and flirts with her. Meanwhile, Mavis is fishing at a pond near her home with Jason. He reveals his stepfather is manipulating Martha into granting him her land. When a group of planters and capitalisters come to the town with the intention to exploit mountain coal lands, Mavis scares them away with her gun. She and Jason later run into the rich aristocrat Gray Pendleton (John Gilbert) and his sweetheart Marjorie Lee (Betty Bouton), who are looking for the town. 
Back at home, Mavis is disappointed Steve is still there. Later that night, Mavis visits a party and meets Gray for the second time. He flirts with her, which makes Jason jealous. Gray forces himself up to Mavis, which makes her upset and angry. She leaves the party and finds out her mother has left her to marry Steve. She decides to marry as well and proposes to Jason. However, they soon find out they are too young.
When word hits town that a man named Morton Sanders (Henry Hebert) is planning to take over the city, some of the inhabitants, including Mavis, threaten him to force him go away. Later that night, Morton is found dead and the police are looking after everyone who was involved. The police visits the Hawn house, but Mavis' grandfather (Fred Huntley) forces them to go away. While holding them with his shotgun Mavis packs her stuff and goes hiding in the forest. The next day, John Burnham visits her and convinces her to go to trial to proof her innocence.
In court, the lawyer of the other party demands for her to be hanged. The town folks try to defend her by all admitting they have shot Morton. Mavis is discharged and finally decides to go to school. Mr. Burnham, Gray and Marjorie are all pleased with Mavis' decision. Jason however, becomes jealous again when she starts hanging out with Gray at school and leaves her.
Six years pass. Mavis has been adopted by the rich Colonel Pendleton (W.H. Bainbridge). One day she receives a letter from her mother, announcing she is getting old and will most-likely die soon. She decides to visit her mom and finds out Steve killed her father. He has become violent and takes it out on Martha. Mavis tries to help her and shoots Steve. Martha survives the incident and takes Mavis in to live with her. Mavis is reunited with a grown-up Jason and they marry.

Nuakhai

Nuakhai or Nuankhai ( or ) (also known as Nabanna) is an agricultural festival mainly observed by people of Western Odisha in India. Nuakhai is observed to welcome the new rice of the season. According to the Hindu calendar it is observed on "panchami tithi" (the fifth day) of the lunar fortnight of the month of Bhadrapada or Bhaadra (August–September), the day after the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. This is the most important social festival of Western Odisha.
About the festival.
Nuakhai is also called "Nuakhai Parab" or "Nuakahi Bhetghat". The word "nua" means new and "khai" means food, so the name means the farmers are in possession of the newly harvested rice. The festival is seen as a new ray of hope, held the day after the Ganesha Chaturthi festival. It has a big significance for farmers and the agricultural community. The festival celebrated at a particular time of day which is called "lagan". Arisa pitha is prepared to celebrate this festival. When the "lagan" comes, the people first remember their village god or goddess and then have their "nua".
Nuakhai is the agricultural festival of Hindus. The festival is observed throughout Odisha, but it is particularly important in the life and culture of Western Odisha. It is a festival for the worship of food grain. It has its best celebration in the Kalahandi, Sambalpur, Balangir, Bargarh, Sundargarh, Jharsuguda, Sonepur, Boudh and Nuapada districts of Odisha .
Ancient origin.
According to local researchers Nuakhai is of fairly ancient origin. Some researchers found the fundamental idea of the celebration can be traced back at least to Vedic times when the "rishis" (sages) had talked of "panchayajna", the five important activities in the annual calendar of an agrarian society. These five activities have been specified as "sitayajna" (the tilling of the land), "pravapana yajna" (the sowing of seeds), "pralambana yajna" (the initial cutting of crops), "khala yajna" (the harvesting of grains) and "prayayana yajna" (the preservation of the produce). In view of this, Nuakhai may be seen as having evolved out of the third activity, namely "pralambana yajna", which involves cutting the first crop and reverently offering it to the mother goddess.
Origin of the current form.
Although the origin of the festival has been lost over time, oral tradition dates its back to the 12th century AD, the time of the first Chauhan Raja Ramai Deo, founder of the princely state of Patna which is currently part of Balangir district in Western Odisha. In his efforts to build an independent kingdom, Raja Ramai Deo realized the significance of settled agriculture because the subsistence economy of the people in the area was primarily based on hunting and food gathering. He realised this form of economy could not generate the surpluses required to maintain and sustain a state. During state formation in the Sambalpuri region, Nuakhai as a ritual festival played a major role in promoting agriculture as a way of life. Thus credit can be given to Raja Ramai Deo for making Nuakhai a symbol of Sambalpuri culture and heritage.
Journey from past to present.
In early years, there was no fixed day for celebration of the festival. It was held sometime during "Bhadraba Sukla Pakhya" (the bright fortnight of Bhadraba). It was the time when the newly grown Kharif crop (autumn crop) of rice started ripening. There are reasons for observing the festival in the month of Bhadrava even though the food grain is not ready for harvesting. The thought is to present the grain to the presiding deity before any bird or animal pecks at it and before it is ready for eating.
In early traditions, farmers would celebrate Nuakhai on a day designated by the village headman and priest. Afterward, under the patronage of royal families, this simple festival was altered into a mass socio-religious event celebrated in the entire Kosal region (Western Odisha resion).
Deities that are offered Nua.
Every year, the "tithi" (day) and "samaya" (time) of observance was astrologically determined by the Hindu priests. Priests sat together at the Brahmapura Jagannath temple in Sambalpur and calculated the day and time. The "tithi" (date) and "lagna" (auspicious moment) were calculated in the name of Pataneswari Devi in the Balangir-Patnagarh area, in the name of Sureswari Devi in the Subarnapur area, and in the name of Manikeswari Devi in the Kalahandi area. In Sundargarh, "Puja" (worship) was first offered by the royal family to the goddess Sekharbasini in the temple which is opened only for Nuakhai. In Sambalpur, at the stipulated "lagna" (auspicious moment), the head priest of Samaleswari Temple offers the "nua-anna" or "nabanna" to the goddess Samaleswari, the presiding deity of Sambalpur .
Rituals of the nine colors of Nuakhai.
People in the Kosal region initiate preparations for the event 15 days in advance. Nuakhai is understood to have nine colours and as a consequence nine sets of rituals are followed as a prelude to the actual day of celebration.
These nine colours include:
Details of the rituals of Nuakhai.
The preparations begin some 15 days prior to the date of the festival, when the elderly persons of the village sit together at a holy place after the "beheren" calls the villagers by blowing a trumpet. Then people get together and discuss with the priests the "tithi" and "lagna" (auspicious day and time) for Nuakhai . The priest consults the "panjika" (astrological almanac) and announces the sacred "muhurta" (a period of time equal to about 48 minutes) when nua is to be taken. This part of the preparations shows elements of both the original tribal festival and elements of Hindu religion. When the caste-Hindus migrated into the area the local tribal people adopted the idea of an astrological calculation of the "tithi" and "lagna" for the Nuakhai festival. In the same way, when the caste-Hindus adopted Nuakhai from the tribal people, they introduced some Sanskritic elements so as to make it more readily accepted by the caste-Hindus.
There was an attempt made during the 1960s to set a common "tithi" for the Nuakhai festival all over the western Odisha . It was decided this was not a workable idea. The idea was reintroduced in 1991 to set the Bhadraba Sukla Panchami tithi for the Nuakhai festival. This became successful and since then, the festival has been celebrated on that day, and the Odisha State Government has declared it an official holiday. Although for the sake of convenience a common auspicious day is set for Nuakhai, the sanctity of the ritual has not lost its importance. Today, however, the system of setting the "tithi" and "lagna" and calling elderly persons for a consensus does not happen in urban areas.
Nuakhai is celebrated both at the community and domestic level. The rituals are first observed at the temple of the reigning deity of the area or to the village deity. Afterward, the people worship in their respective homes and offer rituals to their domestic deity and to Lakshmi, the deity of wealth in the Hindu tradition. People wear new clothes for the occasion. It is a tradition that after offering the nua to the presiding deity, the eldest member of the family distributes nua to other members of the family. After taking the nua, all the junior members of the family offer their regards to their elders. Thereafter follows the "nuakhai juhar", which is the exchange of greetings with friends, well wishers, and relatives. This symbolizes unity. This is an occasion for people to lay their differences to rest and start relationships afresh. Towards the evening people meet one another, exchanging greetings. All differences are discarded and elders are wished "nuakhai juhar". The elders bless their juniors and wish them long life, happiness, and prosperity. Even the partitioned brothers celebrate the festival under one roof. In the evening, folk dances and songs are organized called "Nuakhai Bhetghat". People dance to the foot tapping traditional Sambalpuri dance forms like "Rasarkeli, Dalkhai, Maelajada, Chutkuchuta, Sajani, Nachnia", and "Bajnia".
Other Indian tribes celebrating Nuakhai.
According to (Singh,1982:75) Evidence can be found of the Nuakhai festival been observed by nearly all the major tribes in central and eastern India, with a minor difference in nomenclature. "Jeth Nawakhai" is celebrated among the Dudh Kharia and Pahari Kharia, "Nawakhani" amongst the Oraon and Birjia, "Jom Nawa" among the Munda and Birjia, "Janther" or "Baihar-Horo Nawai" by the Santal, "Gondli Nawakhani" by the tribal people of Ranchi district, "Nawa" by the Birjia, "Nawa-Jom" by the Birhor, "Dhan Nawakhani" by Korwa, and so on. Russel and Hiralal have mentioned the "Nawakhani" festival of the Paraja, a small tribe found in the Bastar region and Odisha . Gautam (1977) observed a new corn offering and rice eating festival of the Santals in Santal Pargana which they term "Jom Nawa". Das Gupta (1978) has noted the "Nawa" ceremony of the Birjia, a section of the Asura tribe of Chhotanagpur. Bhaduri (1944:149-50) presents a short note on the celebration of a festival of the Tripura known as "Mikatal" where "Mi" stands for rice and "Katal" means new. It is celebrated in the month of Aswina (September–October). In West Bengal and in the coastal districts of Odisha, the festival is called "Nabanna" by the caste-Hindus. Regardless of the name, the main objective of this festival is to get social sanction for the new crop, and to invoke the deities to bless the land with abundant crops.
Nuakhai celebrated throughout India.
Nuakhai is a cohesive and unified force between people of the Western Odisha living in Delhi, as they unite and celebrate together the occasion of Nuakhai . Immigrants from the Western Odisha now living in Bangalore, Goa, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkatta, and Vishakapatnam have been celebrating Nuakhai in their new cities for the past few decades. The modern Nuakhai festival, now being observed on the fifth day of the second fortnight of Bhadrava, was unquestionably given a new look of homogeneity and uniformity by various social organizations of Western Odisha, including the Odisha Government in 1991. It has lost some of its enormity and variety with the passage of time, but Nuakhai is still an occasion which endorses the patrimonial nature of the Sambalpuri culture and society.

Mipomersen

Mipomersen (previously ISIS 301012, trade name Kynamro) is a cholesterol-reducing drug candidate. It is an antisense therapeutic that targets the messenger RNA for apolipoprotein B. It is administered as a weekly injection.
Structure.
The compound is a 'second-generation' antisense oligonucleotide; the nucleotides are linked with phosphorothioate linkages rather than the phosphodiester linkages of RNA and DNA, and the sugar parts are deoxyribose in the middle part of the molecule and 2'-"O"-methoxyethyl-modified ribose at the two ends. These modifications make the drug resistant to degradation by nucleases, allowing it to be administered weekly. The drug accumulates in the liver, which is convenient since apolipoprotein B predominantly acts there.
The complete sequence is
with 3'→5' phosphorothioate linkages.
Clinical development.
The drug was discovered and developed to Phase 2 POC by ISIS Pharmaceuticals and subsequently licensed to Genzyme Corporation in an auction-style licensing bid. Isis earned an upfront payment of $325 million, with payments of a further $825 million if certain milestones are met. The licensing deal closed in June 2008. 
Mipomersen completed two separate phase-3 trials with two more Phase 3 trials to be presented in mid-2010.
The two completed Phase 3 trials were in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), both homozygous (ho) and heterozygous (he). FH is a genetic disorder that causes exceptionally high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Both trials showed exceptional performance with the highest efficacy seen so far in those two patient populations, and with relatively low drop-out rates compared to other injectable drugs. Both of these trials also demonstrated the continued manageable safety and tolerability profile of mipomersen.
The remaining Phase 3 studies are due to be presented shortly (mid-2010) and include patients at high risk (HR) or who are severe hypercholesterolemic (SH).
August 2010: Third and fourth phase 3 trials were stated to have met primary and secondary endpoints. 
Genzyme plans to file for the first indication in the first half of 2011 in both the US and EU for hoFH & SH. Subsequently Genzyme plans on filing in the EU only for heFH as the FDA is requesting an outcome study be performed for any indication beyond the first.
Mipomersen is a synthetic molecule and launch quantities will be manufactured by Isis at their Carlsbad manufacturing facilities, and fill & finish will be performed at a third party facility.
In addition to the Phase 3 program, mipomersen has been tested in statin-intolerant patients in a small Phase 2 study. Also, alternative dosing regimens of mipomersen are being tested in Phase 1 studies. The alternative dosing regimen studies are to address long term patient and physician convenience for administering the drug. The drug, if approved, will be provided in a small size needle syringe and can be self-injected by patients. The needle is only one gauge larger than that of insulin making it possibly acceptable and tolerable from the patient's perspective by decreasing the pain of injection. The inconvenience factor of injecting the medication, as opposed to swallowing a pill will likely factor in potentially treating high and moderate risk populations.
In January 2013, The United States Food and Drug Administration approved mipomersen for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

15 Minutes of Shame

"15 Minutes of Shame" is the title of a debut song written by Kelly Archer, Casey Kessel and Justin Weaver, recorded by American country music artist Kristy Lee Cook. It was released in August 2008 as the first single from her album "Why Wait". The single is also her first entry on the "Billboard" country charts, reaching a peak of number 28 in November 2008.
Content.
"15 Minutes of Shame" centralizes on the female narrator, who explains that she is going to tell everyone what she knows about her partner, who has been unfaithful and lied to her ("Every single lie you told, I'm tellin'"). She explains that "every girl in the world's gonna know name", and that she hopes he enjoys his "15 minutes of shame" for his actions. The title is a play on the famous quote by Andy Warhol about everyone getting 15 minutes of fame.
Reception.
"Common Sense" wrote that the song is "a blend of mainstream pop with a country twang, and works surprisingly well in both musical styles and that the lyrics — full of sass and spunk — benefit from Cook's vocals and keep the single lighter and more fun despite the injections of bitterness and mean-spiritedness." "15 Minutes of Shame" got 3 stars from "Common Sense".
The 9513's Jim Malec gave the song a thumbs down, saying "She says she’s going to 'spill the beans' and 'shout it out', but never actually does either of the two, a fact which leaves the whole thing seeming a little bit awkward." Malec added, "Cook doesn’t have the charm of Kellie Pickler or the vocal chops of Carrie Underwood, and, based on this single, it appears she has no imagination as a recording artist. In every way, '15 Minutes of Shame' is a format-driven carbon copy, a direct-from-formula pop-country jingle."
Music video.
The video for the song was released on the CMT website on October 30, 2008.
Chart performance.
"15 Minutes of Shame" debuted at number 58 on the Hot Country Songs charts dated for the week of August 16, 2008, and entered Top 40 on the same chart for the week of October 18. It has sold 45,000 units as of February 2010.

Guy Caballero

Guy Caballero is a fictional character on the television series "SCTV" played by Joe Flaherty. President and owner of the fictional SCTV network, Caballero usually appeared on the series to introduce various network programs, although he also occasionally got wrapped up in behind-the-scenes storylines.
Character.
Cheap, dishonest, gruff, and prone to making meandering patriotic speeches for no good reason, Caballero liked to affectionately describe his employees as "the SCTV family," although he routinely treated them with disdain. He was always seen in a white suit and white Panama hat, but his most notable quirk was his use of a wheelchair despite not needing one; he believed that the wheelchair helped earn people's 'respect'. 
Though Caballero's personal past was left deliberately shady, it was mentioned several times that he was an illegal alien (from South America) who had managed to buy his way into the United States "when he showed up in Panama with suitcases full of Nazi gold." Caballero has a huge mansion named "Casa del Forgeo" that he paid for by forging checks, but he is too cheap to pay for a phone inside the house—instead, he had his mansion built near a payphone.
Guy's wife, Googie, was infrequently mentioned and never seen. He also had two sons (Ricky and Sonny, played by Rick Moranis and Eugene Levy) and a daughter (Connie, played by Andrea Martin). Guy at one point had an affair with SCTV star Lola Heatherton, but broke it off, later explaining (using network ratings terms) "it was doing poorly in the overnights".
Guy Caballero was originally a character heard only over the phone in two first-season SCTV episodes aired in 1977. (Both times, he called Moe Green while on the air to complain about Moe's show "Dialing For Dollars".) The character made his first physical appearance in the SCTV second season opener, aired in September, 1978, and was thereafter a fixture of the show, appearing regularly from that point on. As the owner and president of SCTV, Guy frequently appeared on the network to introduce shows, to make announcements, or to apologize for previous programming blunders. Behind the scenes, Guy was ever on the lookout for cheap, popular programming, and he had no qualms about running shows that pandered to the audience, or were low-quality knockoffs of other, more popular TV series. Sticking to a low, low budget was also a priority, as writer/director/star Johnny LaRue found out after he used an expensive crane shot in his production of "Polynesiantown" -- Caballero cancelled all of LaRue's SCTV projects, and further punished him by forcing him to do a solo late-night program called "Street Beef" which used exactly one camera and one microphone.
It is rumored that Flaherty based the mannerisms and appearance of the Cabellero character on Laurence Olivier's portrayal of Loren Hardman in the movie "The Betsy", released earlier in 1978. Adapted from the Harold Robbins book of the same name, the movie portrays Loren Hardman as the gruff business patriarch of an automobile empire. Like Caballero, Hardman wears a white suit and white Panama hat, and rides in a wheelchair even though he can walk.
Don Caballero's debut album, "For Respect", pays tribute to Guy Caballero and SCTV throughout the album.

Beriev R-1

The Beriev R-1 (known in-house as 'product R') was the first Soviet turbojet-powered flying boat.
Design and development.
At the end of World War II, design work began on a request from the Soviet Navy for a jet-powered flying boat. Starting with the wing design of the Be-6, Beriev began in-house design work in May 1947, even before the official specifications were issued in June 1948. The specifications called for a radar-equipped aircraft with a three-man crew, capable of a speed of 800 kph, and with a range of 2000-2500 kilometers. The aircraft was to be armed with 2,000 kg of bombs and four 20mm cannons.
Beriev completed a mock-up by 10 June 1950, using Klimov VK-1 engines instead of the originally planned Rolls-Royce Nene engines. The first prototype was completed in November 1951. However, the prototype experienced severe vibrations and hydrodynamic instability at 165 km/hr and was nearly destroyed in testing. After much modification, flight testing began at the end of 1951. The prototype crash landed on 3 October 1953 and was again repaired.
Extensive testing continued to 1956, however, the development of land-based long-range reconnaissance aircraft put the project into jeopardy. After another crash in February 1956, the R-1 was never repaired and subsequently scrapped. The R designation is believed to have stood for "Reaktivnyy" (jet-propelled).
Experience gained during the test programme with the R-1 was used in the development of the Beriev Be-10.

Tomorrow We Live (1943 film)

Tomorrow We Live, also called At Dawn We Die, is a 1943 British film, directed by George King, and starring John Clements, Godfrey Tearle, Greta Gynt, Hugh Sinclair and Yvonne Arnaud. 
The film was made during the Second World War, and the action is set in a small town in occupied France. It portrays the activities of members of the French Resistance and the Nazi tactic of taking and shooting innocent hostages in reprisal for acts of sabotage. The opening credits acknowledge "the official co-operation of General de Gaulle and the French National Committee". 
Dorothy Hope is credited with "original story", and the storyline bears a striking similarity to her other wartime film, "Candlelight in Algeria", in which an exceptionally strong heroine comes to the aid of a dashing fighter of tyranny.
Plot.
A young French idealist (John Clements), who gives his name as Jean Baptiste, arrives in "St Pierre-le-Port", a small town near Saint-Nazaire, a major port and base of operations for the German Navy, particularly their U-boats, on the Atlantic coast. Baptiste tells a member of the French Resistance that "I come from Saint-Nazaire. I've details of the submarine base, the docks and power plant. If I can get them to England..." 
The first half of the film often has a lighthearted tone; the Germans are portrayed as bumbling and easily outwitted. The German commandant is overweight and gullible. However, after the Resistance successfully sabotage a German armaments train, the SS take charge of the town, and the occupation takes a brutal turn.
Music.
Nicholas Brodzsky is credited for the music, while the orchestration is credited to Roy Douglas, an English composer who was much in demand as an arranger, orchestrator, and copyist of the music of others, notably Richard Addinsell, Ralph Vaughan Williams and William Walton. However it is possible that Brodzsky actually contributed very little. In a memoir in the William Walton Archive, Roy Douglas claimed, "Brodsky was a so-called composer: I had actually composed entire film scores for him, which went under his name". In a letter to Roy Douglas dated 23 December 1943, William Walton wrote, "I'm delighted about your picture. I'll have a good deal to tell you about Brodsky when I see you. In my capacity as music adviser to Two Cities film company it is going to be my duty to have to tick him off!"
DVD release.
In 2008, the film was released on DVD by Odeon Entertainment as part of their Best of British collection.

Priscus (saint)

Priscus is one of several Catholic saints and martyrs. In the 1921 Benedictine "Book of Saints" there are seven figures named Priscus mentioned. 
There are different feast days involved. In some confusion, he is said to be the first Bishop of Capua, a martyr of the third century, and an African bishop; but the sources have been cast into doubt, and even the century is unclear in some accounts. 
March 28.
The martyr was put to death in 260 under Valerian, with Malchus and Alexander.
May 26.
Priscus, a Roman legionary officer, was put to death in 272 in France, under Aurelian.
September 1.
The story of the African bishop of the fifth century cast adrift is doubted.
October 1.
Priscus, Crescens, and Evagrius were martyrs, put to death in Tomi, on the Black Sea. 
Priscus of Nocera is also distinguished from the Bishop of Capua.

Greenwood Cemetery (Birmingham, Michigan)

Greenwood Cemetery occupies on Oak Avenue between Greenwood and Lake Streets, west of
Old Woodward Avenue, in Birmingham, Michigan. The gently rolling landscape contains over 3,000 graves; 650 date from the nineteenth century. The grounds display a plethora of limestone, marble, cast zinc and granite monuments. An iron fence with low stone piers flanking the entrance fronts the cemetery. In 1885 the Greenwood Cemetery Association was established to maintain the burial ground. When the Association was dissolved in 1946, the city of Birmingham assumed the ownership and maintenance of the cemetery.
History.
The oldest section of Greenwood Cemetery comprises land purchased from the federal government by Dr. Ziba Swan of Albany, New York, in 1821. The first interments on this one-half-acre parcel, set aside by Swan for a cemetery, occurred in 1825, when Polly Utter and her daughter Cynthia were murdered by Imri Fish, a mentally ill War of 1812 veteran who was boarding with the family.
Twenty-one years later twenty-one local citizens, including Dr. Ebenezer Raynale, a member of Michigan's first senate, purchased the cemetery property and an additional one and one-half acres from Swan. Martha Baldwin, founder of the Ladies' Library Association, organized local women into a group that in 1885 incorporated as the Greenwood Cemetery Association. Between 1846 and 1904 the cemetery was enlarged three times, increasing in size to . In 1946 the city of Birmingham took over the operation of the cemetery. Side Two was created in 1825 on the property of Dr. Ziba Swan.
Notable interments.
Greenwood Cemetery contains the remains of some of Oakland County’s earliest pioneers and most prominent citizens. Birmingham’s only American Revolutionary War veteran, John Daniels, was buried here in 1832. He had moved to Michigan with his wife when he was in his 80s. Dr. Swan was interred in 1847.

HSC Jaume II

HSC "Jaume II" is a high-speed ferry operated by Balearia Ferries.
History.
"SeaCat Rapide" was built in 1996 as "Condor 12". For her first season she operated alongside Condor 10 on Condor Ferries Channel Island services. In 1997 the vessel became "Holyman Rapide" and operated on the English Channel. When Hoverspeed bought the Holyman, the "Holyman Rapide" became known as "Rapide" and transferred to Hoverspeed's English Channel Routes.
In March 2001 "Rapide" moved up from the English Channel to Sea Containers Irish Sea services between Liverpool and Dublin, Liverpool and Douglas. She had a reputation of being "flogged to death" by Holyman Ferries and needed much work on her engines.
For March 2002 the "Rapide" was deployed between Belfast and Heysham and services to/from the Isle of Man, however following a disastrous fire on Wednesday 21 August 2002 on the 0700 Belfast-Heysham service when a fire was reported in the Port Engine room at 0800. The vessel was forced to turn back to Belfast and passengers were offered alternative travel arrangements. The service never reopened after that date.
The "Rapide" lay alongside the lay-up berth in Belfast before finally getting repaired by March 2003. With "Seacat Scotland" moving to the English Channel in November 2002, this meant the Belfast to Troon route needed a vessel, as it had been operated by "SeaCat Isle of Man", which needed to return to her Manx services.
On Monday 1 November 2004 "Rapide" had completed the Belfast to Troon service with the 1545 sailing ex Belfast returning from Troon at 1930, she also occasionally covered Manx routes. Finally, the "Rapide" left Belfast for the final time on Monday 8 November 2004 at 1620, bound for Sunderland.
For 2005 "Rapide" was deployed, as "Seacat Rapide", between Dover and Calais for Hoverspeed, however as the Company closed on Monday 7 November 2005 the Rapide was laid up at Tilbury.
In June 2006 "Rapide" left the channel probably for the last time bound for a new career in the Mediterranean with Balearia Ferries, renamed "Jaume II".

<doc id="18978552" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18978552" title="Climate change in Idaho">
Climate change in Idaho

Like other parts of the world, climate in Idaho has changed dramatically over the geologic history of the Earth. Paleo-climatic records give some indication of these changes. The longest instrumented records of climate in Idaho extend back to the late 1800s. Concern over human induced climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and methane from agriculture and industry, are driving research efforts across the state at university, state, and federals levels to understand what the implications of climate change could be in Idaho.
In the big picture of greenhouse gas emissions, Idaho emits the least carbon dioxide per person of the United States, less than 23,000 pounds a year. Idaho forbids coal-power plants. It relies mostly on nonpolluting hydroelectric power from its rivers.
Like other parts of the world, Idaho has seen significant temperature increases, especially in the last several decades. From 1971-2005 the average annual observed temperature in the Snake River Plain, located in southern Idaho, has increased by 1.4 degrees Celsius based on data from 10 climate stations (Dubois, Ashton, Oakely, Pocatello, Aberdeen, Hazelton, Jerome, Boise, Nampa, and Payette). Statistically the increasing temperature trends are most significant in the months of January, March, and April. While precipitation has generally increased, since the early 1900s. The high variability in precipitation makes the identification of precipitation trends statistically difficult.
Over the next century, climate in Idaho will experience additional changes due both to 'natural' climate variability and due to feedbacks related to the interaction between climate variability and increasing greenhouse gases. For example, based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the United Kingdom Hadley Centre’s climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100 temperatures in Idaho could increase by (with a range of to ) in winter and summer and (with a range of to ) in spring and fall. Precipitation is estimated to change little in summer, to increase by 10% in spring and fall (with a range of 5-20%), and to increase by 20% in winter (with a range of 10-40%). Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The impacts described in the sections that follow take into account estimates from different models. The amount of precipitation on extreme wet or snowy days in winter is likely to increase. The frequency of extreme hot days in summer would increase because of the general warming trend. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of winter storms is possible.
Climate Change Impacts.
Human Health.
Warming and other climate changes could expand the habitat and infectivity of disease-carrying insects. Mosquitoes in Idaho can carry malaria, and some can carry western equine encephalitis, which can be lethal or cause neurological damage. Warmer temperatures could
increase the incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in Idaho, because populations of ticks, and their rodent hosts, could increase under warmer temperatures and increased vegetation.
Water Resources.
Idaho relies primarily on surface, but groundwater is also an important source of supply. Most of Idaho is drained by tributaries to the Columbia River, including the Spokane, Pend Oreille, Kootenai, and Snake rivers. These rivers are regulated by dams and reservoirs to reduce spring flooding and augment summer flows. Runoff in the state is strongly affected by winter snow accumulation and spring snowmelt. A warmer climate could mean less snowfall, more winter rain, and a faster, earlier snowmelt. This could result in lower reservoirs and water supplies in the summer and fall. Additionally, without increases in precipitation, higher summer temperatures and increased evaporation also would contribute to lower streamflows and lake levels in the summer. Drier summer conditions would intensify competition for water among the diverse and growing demands in Idaho.
Agriculture.
As climate warms, production patterns could shift northward. Increases in climate variability could make adaptation by farmers more difficult. Warmer climates and less soil moisture due to increased evaporation may increase the need for irrigation. However, these same conditions could decrease water supplies.
In Idaho, production agriculture is a $2.8 billion annual industry, 60% of which comes from crops. Almost 70% of the farmed acres are irrigated. The major crops in the state are wheat, hay, barley, and potatoes. Climate change could increase wheat yields by 9-18%. Barley and hay could increase by 12%, and potato yields could fall by 18% under severe conditions where temperatures rise beyond the tolerance levels of the crop. Farmed acres could rise or fall by 10%, depending on how climate changes.
Forest.
Hotter, drier weather could increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires, threatening both property and forests. Drier conditions would reduce the range and health of lodgepole and Douglas-fir forests, and increase their susceptibility to fire.
Grass and rangeland could expand into previously forested areas along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and into some of the western valleys.
Changes would significantly affect the character of Idaho forests and the activities that depend on them.
Ecosystems.
Idaho is rich in ecological diversity. 
Climate change could exacerbate many of the problems facing ecosystems in Idaho. Although wildfires are a natural and necessary part of the ecology of western forests, changes in
fire regimes under climate change have significant implications. 
Climate change poses a threat to high alpine systems, and could lead to their significant decline. Local extinctions of alpine species such as arctic gentian, alpine chaenactis, rosy finch and water pipit have resulted from habitat loss and fragmentation, both of which could worsen under climate change. Whitebark pine forest could be replaced with Douglas fir. On the lower slopes, forests would give way to treeless landscapes dominated by sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.
Action To address climate change.
Idaho is the home of the Yellowstone-Teton Clean Energy Coalition and the Treasure Valley Clean Cities Coalition.
Renewable energy and propulsion.
Alternative Fuels Tax.
The motor fuel tax rate of $0.25 per gallon does not apply to special fuels dispensed into a motor vehicle that uses gaseous special fuels and displays a valid gaseous special fuels permit. Special fuels include compressed and liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, and fuel suitable for use in diesel engines. The state excise tax on special fuels, determined on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis, still applies. Alternatively, an annual fee in lieu of the excise tax may be collected on a vehicle powered by gaseous special fuels, according to the gross vehicle weight rating of the vehicle. State government agencies are entitled to a refund of any special fuels tax paid to the vendor from which the fuel was purchased. No refund of special fuels tax shall be paid on special fuels used while idling a registered motor vehicle. Idling means a period of time greater than 15 minutes when the motor vehicle is stationary with the engine operating.
State Agency Petroleum Reduction Plan.
All executive branch state agencies are required to reduce the petroleum consumption of their fleets by increasing the fuel economy of their vehicles and reducing the number of miles driven by each employee. Agencies must also give priority to acquiring hybrid electric vehicles and other fuel-efficient, low-emissions vehicles.
Neighborhood Electric Vehicle.
An neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) is defined as a self-propelled, electrically powered, four-wheeled motor vehicle that does not produce emissions and conforms to the definition and requirements for low-speed vehicles as adopted in the federal motor vehicle safety standards under Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 571.
Biomass.
Studies indicate that Wyoming has fair biomass resource potential. For more state-specific resource information, see Biomass Feedstock Availability in the United States: 1999 State Level Analysis.
Geothermal.
Wyoming has high-temperature resources that are suitable for electricity generation, as well as direct use and heat pump applications. For more information on geothermal resources, including resource maps, visit GeoPowering the West.
Hydropower.
Wyoming has a good hydropower resource as a percentage of the state's electricity generation. For additional resource information, check out the Idaho National Laboratory's Virtual Hydropower Prospector (VHP). VHP is a convenient geographic information system (GIS) tool designed to assist you in locating and assessing natural stream water energy resources in the United States.
Solar.
To accurately portray your state's solar resource, we need two maps. That is because different collector types use the sun in different ways. Collectors that focus the sun (like a magnifying glass) can reach high temperatures and efficiencies. These are called concentrating collectors. Typically, these collectors are on a tracker, so they always face the sun directly. Because these collectors focus the sun's rays, they only use the direct rays coming straight from the sun.
Other solar collectors are simply flat panels that can be mounted on a roof or on the ground. Called flat-plate collectors, these are typically fixed in a tilted position correlated to the latitude of the location. This allows the collector to best capture the sun. These collectors can use both the direct rays from the sun and reflected light that comes through a cloud or off the ground. Because they use all available sunlight, flat-plate collectors are the best choice for many northern states. 
The Renewable Energy Atlas of the West estimated the annual solar electricity generation potential in Wyoming to be 72 billion kWh, based on the following assumptions:
Rooftop and open space installed systems represent 0.5% of the total area of the state. 
Solar panels occupy 30% of the area set aside for solar equipment. 
The average system efficiency is 10%.
Wind.
According to Wind Powering America, Wyoming has wind resources consistent with utility-scale production. There is a large area of excellent to superb resource in the southeastern part of the state north of Cheyenne. Other outstanding resource areas are in south-central Wyoming from the Colorado border north toward Casper. Additional regions with good to excellent resource are between Casper and Gillette in northeastern Wyoming and on ridge crests throughout the state. In addition, small wind turbines may have applications in some areas. 
The Renewable Energy Atlas of the West estimated the annual wind electricity generation potential in Wyoming to be 883 billion kWh. The estimate excludes 100% of the following areas, which are assumed to be infeasible for wind development:
Energy efficiency.
Energy efficiency means doing the same work, or more, and enjoying the same comfort level with less energy. Consequently, energy efficiency can be considered part of your state's energy resource base - a demand side resource. Unlike energy conservation, which is rooted in behavior, energy efficiency is technology-based. This means the savings may be predicted by engineering calculations, and they are sustained over time. Examples of energy efficiency measures and equipment include compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), and high efficiency air conditioners, refrigerators, boilers, and chillers.
Saving energy through efficiency is less expensive than building new power plants. Utilities can plan for, invest in, and add up technology-based energy efficiency measures and, as a consequence, defer or avoid the need to build a new power plant. In this way, Austin, Texas, aggregated enough energy savings to offset the need for a planned 450-megawatt coal-fired power plant. Austin achieved these savings during a decade when the local economy grew by 46% and the population doubled. In addition, the savings from energy efficiency are significantly greater than one might expect, because no energy is needed to generate, transmit, distribute, and store energy before it reaches the end user.
Reduced fuel use, and the resulting decreased pollution, provide short- and long-term economic and health benefits.

Domestic violence

Domestic violence, also known as domestic abuse, spousal abuse, battering, family violence, dating abuse, and intimate partner violence (IPV), is a pattern of behavior which involves the abuse by one partner against another in an intimate relationship such as marriage, cohabitation, dating or within the family. Domestic violence can take many forms, including physical aggression or assault (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, slapping, throwing objects, battery), or threats thereof; sexual abuse; controlling or domineering; intimidation; stalking; passive/covert abuse (e.g., neglect); and economic deprivation.
Alcohol consumption and mental illness can be co-morbid with abuse, and present additional challenges in eliminating domestic violence.
Awareness, perception, definition and documentation of domestic violence differs widely from country to country, and from era to era.
Domestic violence and abuse is not limited to obvious physical violence. Domestic violence can also mean endangerment, criminal coercion, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, trespassing, harassment, and stalking.
Laws on domestic violence vary by country. While it is generally outlawed in the Western World, this is not the case in many developing countries. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks. The social acceptability of domestic violence also differs by country. While in most developed countries domestic violence is considered unacceptable by most people, in many regions of the world the views are different: according to a UNICEF survey, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example: 90% in Afghanistan and Jordan, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea and Timor-Leste, 81% in Laos, 80% in Central African Republic. Refusing to submit to a husband's wishes is a common reason given for justification of violence in developing countries: for instance 62.4% of women in Tajikistan justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.
Traditionally, in most cultures, men had a legal right to use violence to "discipline" their wives. Although in the US and many European countries this right was removed from them in the late 19th/early 20th century, before the 1970s criminal arrests were very rare (occurring only in cases of extreme violence), and it was only in the 1990s that rigorous enforcement of laws against domestic violence became standard policy in Western countries.
Definitions.
The definition of the term "domestic violence" varies, depending on the context in which it is used. It may be defined differently in medical, legal, political or social contexts. The definitions have varied over time, and vary in different parts of the world. Traditionally, domestic violence was mostly associated with physical violence. For instance, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition, domestic violence is: "the inflicting of physical injury by one family or household member on another; also: a repeated / habitual pattern of such behavior." However, domestic violence today, as defined by international conventions and by governments, has a much broader definition, including sexual, psychological and economic abuse.
The Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence states that: 
The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women classifies violence against women into three categories: that occurring in the family (DV), that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State. Family violence is defined as follows:
The term "intimate partner violence" (IPV) is often used synonymously with domestic abuse or domestic violence. Family violence is a broader definition, often used to include child abuse, elder abuse, and other violent acts between family members.
Broad definitions of domestic violence are common today. For instance the Act XX on Domestic Violence 2006, in Malta, defines DV as follows:
Terms such wife abuse, wife beating, and battering are descriptive terms that have lost popularity recently for several reasons:
"Domestic violence" may also be the name of a specific criminal offense, in a Criminal Code of a jurisdiction, describing various criminal acts. It may also appear in the context of legislation that is not necessary criminal, but rather civil (providing for civil remedies, protection orders etc.). See, for example, Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005.
The definition of a "domestic violence" is dependent upon the relationship between the perpetrator and victim. Depending on jurisdiction, they may be considered to be in a "domestic relationship" if they are married, cohabiting, immediate family member, blood relation, parents of a child/children, or two people who date, or have been engaged to be married.
Government definitions.
The US Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) defines domestic violence as a "pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner". The definition adds that domestic violence "can happen to anyone regardless of race, age, sexual orientation, religion, or gender", and can take many forms, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional, economic, and psychological abuse.
The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service in the United Kingdom in its "Domestic Violence Policy" uses "domestic violence" to refer to a range of violent and abusive behaviours, defining it as:
Dynamics classification.
Violence by a person against their intimate partner is often done as a way for controlling their partner, even if this kind of violence is not the most frequent. Many types of intimate partner violence occur, including violence between gay and lesbian couples, and by women against their male partners.
Intimate partner violence types.
Michael P. Johnson argues for four major types of intimate partner violence, which is supported by subsequent research and evaluation. as well as independent researchers.
Distinctions are made among the types of violence, motives of perpetrators, and the social and cultural context based upon patterns across numerous incidents and motives of the perpetrator. Types of violence identified by Johnson:
Types of male batterers identified by Holtzworth-Munroe and Stuart (1994) include "family-only", which primarily fall into the CCV type, who are generally less violent and less likely to perpetrate psychological and sexual abuse.
Other.
Others, such as the US Centers for Disease Control, divide domestic violence into two types: reciprocal, in which both partners are violent, and non-reciprocal violence, in which one partner is violent.
Physical.
Physical abuse is abuse involving contact intended to cause feelings of intimidation, pain, injury, or other physical suffering or bodily harm.
Physical abuse includes hitting, slapping, punching, choking, pushing, burning and other types of contact that result in physical injury to the victim. Physical abuse can also include behaviors such as denying the victim of medical care when needed, depriving the victim of sleep or other functions necessary to live, or forcing the victim to engage in drug/alcohol use against his/her will. If a person is suffering from any physical harm then they are experiencing physical abuse. This pain can be experienced on any level. It can also include inflicting physical injury onto other targets, such as children or pets, in order to cause psychological harm to the victim.
Sexual.
Sexual abuse is any situation in which force or threat is used to obtain participation in unwanted sexual activity. Coercing a person to engage in sexual activity against their will, even if that person is a spouse or intimate partner with whom consensual sex has occurred, is an act of aggression and violence.
Sexual violence is defined by World Health Organization as:
Categories of sexual abuse include:
Marital rape.
Marital rape, also known as spousal rape, is non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. It is a form of partner rape, of domestic violence, and of sexual abuse. Once widely condoned or ignored by law, spousal rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative.
The criminalization of rape in marriage is recent, having occurred during the past few decades. The legal and social concept of marital rape, has developed, in most industrialized countries, in the mid to late 20th century; and in many parts of the world it is still not recognized, socially and legally, as a form of abuse. Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but other countries in Western Europe and the English-speaking Western World outlawed it much later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s. In many parts of the world the laws against marital rape are very new, having been enacted in the 2000s.
In the US spousal rape is illegal in all 50 states. In Canada, spousal rape was outlawed in 1983, when several legal changes were made, including changing the rape statute to "sexual assault", and making the laws gender neutral. Criminalization in Australia began with the state of New South Wales in 1981, followed by all other states from 1985 to 1992. New Zealand outlawed spousal rape in 1985, and Ireland in 1990.
In England and Wales, spousal rape was made illegal in 1991, when the marital rape exemption was abolished by the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, in the case of "R v R".
Emotional.
Emotional abuse (also called psychological abuse or mental abuse) can include humiliating the victim privately or publicly, controlling what the victim can and cannot do, withholding information from the victim, deliberately doing something to make the victim feel diminished or embarrassed, isolating the victim from friends and family, implicitly blackmailing the victim by harming others when the victim expresses independence or happiness, or denying the victim access to money or other basic resources and necessities. Degradation in any form can be considered psychological abuse.
Emotional abuse can include verbal abuse and is defined as any behavior that threatens, intimidates, undermines the victim’s self-worth or self-esteem, or controls the victim’s freedom. This can include threatening the victim with injury or harm, telling the victim that they will be killed if they ever leave the relationship, and public humiliation. Constant criticism, name-calling, and making statements that damage the victim’s self-esteem are also common verbal forms of emotional abuse.
Often perpetrators will attempt and may succeed in alienating (parental alienation), a child from a parent or extended family member, and in doing so also victimize the child when the child is engaged in emotional abuse by encouraging, teaching or forcing them to harshly criticize another victim.
Emotional abuse includes conflicting actions or statements which are designed to confuse and create insecurity in the victim. These behaviors also lead the victims to question themselves, causing them to believe that they are making up the abuse or that the abuse is their fault.
Emotional abuse includes forceful efforts to isolate the victim, keeping them from contacting friends or family. This is intended to eliminate those who might try to help the victim leave the relationship and to create a lack of resources for them to rely on if they were to leave. Isolation results in damaging the victim’s sense of internal strength, leaving them feeling helpless and unable to escape from the situation.
People who are being emotionally abused often feel as if they do not own themselves; rather, they may feel that their significant other has nearly total control over them. Women or men undergoing emotional abuse often suffer from depression, which puts them at increased risk for suicide, eating disorders, and drug and alcohol abuse.
Verbal.
Verbal abuse is a form of emotionally abusive behavior involving the use of language. Verbal abuse can also be referred to as the act of threatening. Through threatening a person can blatantly say they will harm you in any way and will also be considered as abuse. It may include profanity but can occur with or without the use of expletives.
Verbal abuse may include aggressive actions such as name-calling, blaming, ridicule, disrespect, and criticism, but there are also less obviously aggressive forms of verbal abuse. Statements that may seem benign on the surface can be thinly veiled attempts to humiliate; falsely accuse; or manipulate others to submit to undesirable behavior, make others feel unwanted and unloved, threaten others economically, or isolate victims from support systems.
In Jekyll and Hyde behaviors, the abuser may fluctuate between sudden rages and false joviality toward the victim; or may simply show a very different "face" to the outside world than to the victim. While oral communication is the most common form of verbal abuse, it includes abusive communication in written form.
Economic.
Economic abuse is a form of abuse when one intimate partner has control over the other partner's access to economic resources. Economic abuse may involve preventing a spouse from resource acquisition, limiting the amount of resources to use by the victim, or by exploiting economic resources of the victim. The motive behind preventing a spouse from acquiring resources is to diminish victim's capacity to support his/herself, thus forcing him/her to depend on the perpetrator financially, which includes preventing the victim from obtaining education, finding employment, maintaining or advancing their careers, and acquiring assets.
In addition, the abuser may also put the victim on an allowance, closely monitor how the victim spends money, spend victim's money without his/her consent and creating debt, or completely spend victim's savings to limit available resources
Specific forms in parts of the world.
In some parts of the world, specific forms of domestic violence, such as honor killings, acid attacks and dowry violence, are common.
Honor killings.
An honor killing is the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members, due to the belief of the perpetrators that the victim has brought dishonor upon the family or community. Although these crimes are most often associated with the Middle East, they occur in other places too.
Human Rights Watch defines "honor killings" as follows:
Honor killings are acts of vengeance, usually death, committed by male family members against female family members, who are held to have brought dishonor upon the family. A woman can be targeted by (individuals within) her family for a variety of reasons, including: refusing to enter into an arranged marriage, being the victim of a sexual assault, seeking a divorce—even from an abusive husband—or (allegedly) committing adultery. The mere perception that a woman has behaved in a way that "dishonors" her family is sufficient to trigger an attack on her life.
Acid throwing.
Acid throwing, also called an acid attack or vitriolage is defined as the act of throwing acid onto the body of a person "with the intention of injuring or disfiguring out of jealousy or revenge". Perpetrators of these attacks throw acid at their victims, usually at their faces, burning them, and damaging skin tissue, often exposing and sometimes dissolving the bones. The long term consequences of these attacks include blindness and permanent scarring of the face and body.
Acid attacks are often connected to domestic disputes in places such as Pakistan and Bangladesh. In India, these attacks also happen in connection to dowry murders.
These attacks are most often associated with South and Southeast Asia (especially Cambodia, Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan,) but are also common in other places, such as Colombia, and have also occurred in Europe. In the UK, the case of Katie Piper, who had acid thrown in her face by her ex-boyfriend and an accomplice, was highly publicized.
Dowry violence and bride burning.
In parts of the world, such as South Asia, the custom of dowry is related to severe forms of violence, including murder. Bride burning is a form of domestic violence in which a bride is killed at home by her husband or husband's family due to his dissatisfaction over the dowry provided by her family. The act is often a result of demands for more or prolonged dowry after the marriage. It is a major problem in countries such as India. Dowry death refers to the phenomenon of women and girls being killed or committing suicide due to disputes regarding dowry.
Violence against victims of rape.
In many cultures, victims of rape face severe violence, including honor killings, from their families and relatives. In many parts of the world, women who have been raped are considered to have brought 'dishonour' or 'disgrace' to their families. This is especially the case if the victim becomes pregnant.
Violence related to female virginity.
Female virginity is the trigger of many forms of violence against women. Sex outside marriage is illegal in many countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Sudan, Yemen.
In many parts of the world, the social expectation for a bride to be a virgin is extremely strong, and if the husband has sex with his wife after marriage and she does not bleed (it is possible for a woman to "not" bleed when she has sex for the first time ), this can end in extreme violence, including an honor killing.
Social views.
The social views on domestic violence vary from person to person, and from region to region, but in many places outside the West, the concept in very poorly understood. This is because in most of these countries, the relation between the husband and wife is not considered one of equals, but instead one in which the wife must submit herself to the husband. This is codified in the laws of some countries - for example, in Yemen, marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.
"Disobeying" a husband can often result in violence. These violent acts are not considered a form of abuse by society (both men and women) but are considered as being provoked by the behavior of the wife who is seen as being at fault herself. While beatings of wives are often a response to "inappropriate" behaviors, in many places extreme acts such as honor killings are approved by a high section of the society. In one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in Jordan's capital city, Amman, approved of honor killings. This survey was carried in the capital of Jordan, which is much more liberal the other parts of the country; the researchers said that "We would expect that in the more rural and traditional parts of Jordan, support for honour killings would be even higher".
In a 2012 news story, "The Washington Post" reported, "The Reuters TrustLaw group named India one of the worst countries in the world for women this year, in part because domestic violence there is often seen as deserved. A 2012 report by UNICEF found that 57 percent of Indian boys and 53 percent of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 think wife-beating is justified."
In conservative cultures, a wife dressing in attire deemed to be not sufficiently modest can result in serious violence by her husband or relatives, with such violent responses being seen as appropriate by most of the society: in a survey, 62.8% of women in Afghanistan said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she wears inappropriate clothes.
In many places, sex in marriage is constructed as the right of the husband, who can claim it by force, if "necessary". For instance, in Lebanon, while discussing a proposed law that would criminalize marital rape, Sheik Ahmad Al-Kurdi, a judge in the Sunni religious court, said that the law "could lead to the imprisonment of the man where in reality he is exercising the least of his marital rights."
In many countries, women are instructed before marriage that sex with the husband is their absolute duty, that they do not have the right to ever refuse it, even if they don't want it; and as a result it becomes impossible to understand the concept of marital rape - for example one survey found that 74% of women in Mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him.
Religion.
The relation between DV and religion is often discussed. There are several passages in the Bible which are subject to debate in regard to gender relations, such as Ephesians 5:22-33 (wives subordination to their husbands) or 1 Corinthians 7:3-5, interpreted by some religious figures as to render the concept of marital rape impossible.
In Islam, many interpretations of Surah, An-Nisa, 34 in the Qur'an find that a husband hitting a wife is allowed.
Taj Hashmi states in the book "Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh":
Custom and tradition.
Local customs and traditions are often responsible for maintaining certain forms of DV. Such customs and traditions include son preference (the desire of a family to have a boy and not a girl, which is strongly prevalent in parts of Asia), which can lead to abuse and neglect of girl children by disappointed family members; child and forced marriages; dowry; the hierarchic caste system which stigmatizes "lower castes" and "untouchables", leading to discrimination and restricted opportunities of the females and thus making them more vulnerable to abuse; strict dress codes for women that may be enforced through violence by family members; strong requirement of female virginity before the wedding and violence related to non-conforming women and girls; taboos about menstruation leading to females being isolated and shunned during the time of menstruation; female genital mutilation (FGM); ideologies of marital 'conjugal rights' to sex which justify marital rape; the importance given to 'family honor'. In recent years, there has been progress in these areas, with laws being enacted in several countries: for example the 2004 Criminal Code of Ethiopia has a chapter on harmful traditional practices - "Chapter III - Crimes Committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices". However, most of these practices are centuries old traditions, which are deeply engrained in society, and are very difficult to challenge. The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence reads at Article 42:
Relation to forced and child marriage.
A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent. In many parts of the world, it is often difficult to draw a line between 'forced' and 'consensual' marriage: in many cultures (especially in South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa), marriages are prearranged, often as soon a girl is born; the idea of a girl going against the wishes of her family and choosing herself her own future husband is not socially accepted - there is no need to use threats or violence to force the marriage, the future bride will submit because she simply has no other choice. As in the case of child marriage, the customs of dowry and bride price contribute to this phenomenon. A child marriage is a marriage where one or both parties are younger than 18.
Forced and child marriages are associated with a high rate of domestic violence. These types of marriages are related to violence both in regard to the spousal violence perpetrated inside marriage, and in regard to the violence related to the customs and traditions of these marriage: violence and trafficking related to the payment of dowry and bride price, honor killings for refusing the marriage.
HIV/AIDS.
[[File:AIDS and HIV prevalence.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt= A map of the world where most of the land is colored green or yellow except for sub Saharan Africa which is colored red|Estimated prevalence in % of HIV among young adults (15–49) per country as of 2011.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that women in abusive relations are at significantly higher risk of HIV/AIDS. WHO states that women in violent relations have difficulty negotiating safer sex with their partners, are often forced to have sex, and find it difficult to ask for appropriate testing when they think they may be infected with HIV. The WHO stated that:
Effects.
On children.
3.3 million children witness domestic violence each year in the US. There has been an increase in acknowledgment that a child who is exposed to domestic abuse during their upbringing will suffer in their developmental and psychological welfare. During the mid 1990s, the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study found that children who were exposed to domestic violence and other forms of abuse had a higher risk of developing mental and physical health problems. Because of the awareness of domestic violence that some children have to face, it also generally impacts how the child develops emotionally, socially, behaviorally as well as cognitively.
Some emotional and behavioral problems that can result due to domestic violence include increased aggressiveness, anxiety, and changes in how a child socializes with friends, family, and authorities. Depression, emotional insecurity, and mental health disorders can follow due to traumatic experiences. Problems with attitude and cognition in schools can start developing, along with a lack of skills such as problem-solving. Correlation has been found between the experience of abuse and neglect in childhood and perpetrating domestic violence and sexual abuse in adulthood.
Additionally, in some cases the abuser will purposely abuse the mother or father in front of the child to cause a ripple effect, hurting two victims simultaneously. It has been found that children who witness mother-assault are more likely to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Consequences to these children are likely to be more severe if their assaulted mother develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and does not seek treatment due to her difficulty in assisting her child with processing his or her own experience of witnessing the domestic violence.
Family Violence prevention in Australia and other countries has begun to focus on breaking intergenerational cycles, according to the National (Aust) Standards for Working with Children Exposed to Family Violence it is important to acknowledge that exposing children to Family Violence is child abuse. Some of the effects of Family Violence on children are highlighted in the Queensland Government and SunnyKids awareness raising campaign.
Physical.
Bruises, broken bones, head injuries, lacerations, and internal bleeding are some of the acute effects of a domestic violence incident that require medical attention and hospitalization.
Some chronic health conditions that have been linked to victims of domestic violence are arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain, pelvic pain, ulcers, and migraines.
Victims who are pregnant during a domestic violence relationship experience greater risk of miscarriage, pre-term labor, and injury to or death of the fetus.
Psychological.
Among victims who are still living with their perpetrators high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly reported. Depression is also common, as victims are made to feel guilty for ‘provoking’ the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense criticism. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicidality.
In addition to depression, victims of domestic violence also commonly experience long-term anxiety and panic, and are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic violence is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by flashbacks, intrusive images, exaggerated startle response, nightmares, and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse. These symptoms are generally experienced for a long span of time after the victim has left the dangerous situation. Many researchers state that PTSD is possibly the best diagnosis for those suffering from psychological effects of domestic violence, as it accounts for the variety of symptoms commonly experienced by victims of trauma.
Financial.
Once victims leave their perpetrator, they can be stunned with the reality of the extent to which the abuse has taken away their autonomy. Due to economic abuse and isolation, the victim usually has very little money of their own and few people on whom they can rely when seeking help. This has been shown to be one of the greatest obstacles facing victims of DV, and the strongest factor that can discourage them from leaving their perpetrators.
In addition to lacking financial resources, victims of DV often lack specialized skills, education, and training that are necessary to find gainful employment, and also may have several children to support. In 2003, thirty-six major US cities cited DV as one of the primary causes of homelessness in their areas. It has also been reported that one out of every three homeless women are homeless due to having left a DV relationship. If a victim is able to secure rental housing, it is likely that her apartment complex will have "zero tolerance" policies for crime; these policies can cause them to face eviction even if they are the victim (not the perpetrator) of violence. While the number of shelters and community resources available to DV victims has grown tremendously, these agencies often have few employees and hundreds of victims seeking assistance which causes many victims to remain without the assistance they need.
Long-term.
Domestic violence can trigger many different responses in victims, all of which are very relevant for any professional working with a victim. Major consequences of domestic violence victimization include psychological/mental health issues and chronic physical health problems. Some long term effects on a child who comes from an abusive household, or have been abused themselves are guilt, anger, depression/anxiety, shyness, nightmares, disruptiveness, irritability,and problems getting along with others. Although they may have not been the ones being abused it still affects them because they had to experience and witness their loved ones being abused, which takes a toll on them as well. Domestic violence also teaches poor family structure. A child who grows up being abused thinks of that as a way a family functions, and will grow up and repeat the cycle because that is all they know. Some other long term affects include but are not limited to poor health, low self-esteem, difficulty sleeping, drug and alcohol abuse risk, isolation, suicidal thoughts, and extreme loneliness and fear. A victim’s overwhelming lack of resources can also lead to homelessness and poverty. A person who has suffered abuse is at risk for a lot of negative consequences that can put them on a destructive path for their future.
On responders.
Vicarious trauma.
Due to the gravity and intensity of hearing victims’ stories of abuse, professionals (social workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical professionals) are at risk themselves for secondary or vicarious trauma (VT), which causes the responder to experience trauma symptoms similar to the original victim after hearing about the victim’s experiences with abuse. Research has demonstrated that professionals who experience vicarious trauma show signs of exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts although they have not experienced a trauma personally and do not qualify for a clinical diagnosis of PTSD.
Researchers concluded that although clinicians have professional training and are equipped with the necessary clinical skills to assist victims of domestic violence, they may still be personally affected by the emotional impact of hearing about a victim’s traumatic experiences. Iliffe et al. found that there are several common initial responses that are found in clinicians who work with victims: loss of confidence in their ability to help the client, taking personal responsibility for ensuring the client’s safety, and remaining supportive of the client’s autonomy if they make the decision to return to their perpetrator.
It has also been shown that clinicians who work with a large number of victims may alter their former perceptions of the world, and begin to doubt the basic goodness of others. Iliffe et al. found that clinicians who work with victims tend to feel less secure in the world, become "acutely aware" of power and control issues both in society and in their own personal relationships, have difficulty trusting others, and experience an increased awareness of gender-based power differences in society.
The best way for a clinician to avoid developing VT is to engage in good self-care practices. These can include exercise, relaxation techniques, debriefing with colleagues, and seeking support from supervisors. Additionally, it is recommended that clinicians make the positive and rewarding aspects of working with domestic violence victims the primary focus of thought and energy, such as being part of the healing process or helping society as a whole. Clinicians should also continually evaluate their empathic responses to victims, in order to avoid feelings of being drawn into the trauma that the victim experienced. It is recommended that clinicians practice good boundaries, and find a balance in expressing empathic responses to the victim while still maintaining personal detachment from their traumatic experiences.
Burnout.
Vicarious trauma can lead directly to burnout, which is defined as "emotional exhaustion resulting from excessive demands on energy, strength, and personal resources in the work setting". The physical warning signs of burnout include headaches, fatigue, lowered immune function, and irritability. A clinician experiencing burnout may begin to lose interest in the welfare of clients, be unable to empathize or feel compassion for clients, and may even begin to feel aversion toward the client.
If the clinician experiencing burnout is working with victims of domestic violence, the clinician risks causing further great harm through re-victimization of the client. It should be noted, however, that vicarious trauma does not always directly lead to burnout and that burnout can occur in clinicians who work with any difficult population – not only those who work with domestic violence victims.
Causes.
There are many different theories as to the causes of domestic violence. These include psychological theories that consider personality traits and mental characteristics of the perpetrator, as well as social theories which consider external factors in the perpetrator's environment, such as family structure, stress,and social learning. As with many phenomena regarding human experience, no single approach appears to cover all cases.
Whilst there are many theories regarding what causes one individual to act violently towards an intimate partner or family member there is also growing concern around apparent intergenerational cycles of domestic violence. In Australia where it has been identified that as many as 75% of all victims of domestic violence are children Domestic violence services such as Sunnykids are beginning to focus their attention on children who have been exposed to domestic violence.
Responses that focus on children suggest that experiences throughout life influence an individuals' propensity to engage in family violence (either as a victim or as a perpetrator). Researchers supporting this theory suggest it is useful to think of three sources of domestic violence: childhood socialization, previous experiences in couple relationships during adolescence, and levels of strain in a person's current life. People who observe their parents abusing each other, or who were themselves abused may incorporate abuse into their behaviour within relationships that they establish as adults. (Kalmuss & Seltzer 1984)
Biological.
These factors include genetics and brain dysfunction and are studied by neuroscience.
Psychological.
Psychological theories focus on personality traits and mental characteristics of the offender. Personality traits include sudden bursts of anger, poor impulse control, and poor self-esteem. Various theories suggest that psychopathology and other personality disorders are factors, and that abuse experienced as a child leads some people to be more violent as adults. Correlation has been found between juvenile delinquency and domestic violence in adulthood. Studies have found high incidence of psychopathy among abusers.
For instance, some research suggests that about 80% of both court-referred and self-referred men in these domestic violence studies exhibited diagnosable psychopathology, typically personality disorders. "The estimate of personality disorders in the general population would be more in the 15–20% range [...] As violence becomes more severe and chronic in the relationship, the likelihood of psychopathology in these men approaches 100%."
Dutton has suggested a psychological profile of men who abuse their wives, arguing that they have borderline personalities that are developed early in life.
However, these psychological theories are disputed: Gelles suggests that psychological theories are limited, and points out that other researchers have found that only 10% (or less) fit this psychological profile. He argues that social factors are important, while personality traits, mental illness, or psychopathy are lesser factors.
Mental illness.
Psychiatric disorders are sometimes associated with domestic violence, such as borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, drug abuse, and alcoholism. It is estimated that at least one-third of all abusers have some type of mental illness.
Marital conflict disorder.
The American Psychiatric Association planning and research committees for the forthcoming DSM-5 (2013) have canvassed a series of new Relational disorders which include "Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence" or "Marital Abuse Disorder (Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence)". Couples with marital disorders sometimes come to clinical attention because the couple recognize long-standing dissatisfaction with their marriage and come to the clinician on their own initiative or are referred by an astute health care professional. Secondly, there is serious violence in the marriage which is "usually the husband battering the wife".
In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority often is the first to notify the clinician. Most importantly, marital violence "is a major risk factor for serious injury and even death and women in violent marriages are at much greater risk of being seriously injured or killed (National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women 2000)". The authors of this study add that "There is current considerable controversy over whether male-to-female marital violence is best regarded as a reflection of male psychopathology and control or whether there is an empirical base and clinical utility for conceptualizing these patterns as relational."
Recommendations for clinicians making a diagnosis of "Marital Relational Disorder" should include the assessment of actual or "potential" male violence as regularly as they assess the potential for suicide in depressed patients. Further, "clinicians should not relax their vigilance after a battered wife leaves her husband, because some data suggest that the period immediately following a marital separation is the period of greatest risk for the women. Many men will stalk and batter their wives in an effort to get them to return or punish them for leaving. Initial assessments of the potential for violence in a marriage can be supplemented by standardized interviews and questionnaires, which have been reliable and valid aids in exploring marital violence more systematically".
The authors conclude with what they call "very recent information" on the course of violent marriages which suggests that "over time a husband's battering may abate somewhat, but perhaps because he has successfully intimidated his wife. The risk of violence remains strong in a marriage in which it has been a feature in the past. Thus, treatment is essential here; the clinician cannot just wait and watch". The most urgent clinical priority is the protection of the wife because she is the one most frequently at risk, and clinicians must be aware that supporting assertiveness by a battered wife may lead to more beatings or even death.
Jealousy.
Many cases of domestic violence occur due to jealousy when one partner is either suspected of being unfaithful or is planning to leave the relationship. It can also be seen in a situation where one partner is doing better than the other. For example: the woman being more successful than the husband. An evolutionary psychology explanation of such cases of domestic violence against a woman is that they represent male attempts to control female reproduction and ensure sexual exclusivity through violence or the threat of violence.
Behavioral.
Behavioral theories draw on the work of behavior analysts. Applied behavior analysis uses the basic principles of learning theory to change behavior. Behavioral theories of domestic violence focus on the use of functional assessment with the goal of reducing episodes of violence to zero rates. This program leads to behavior therapy. Often by identifying the antecedents and consequences of violent action, the abusers can be taught self control. Recently more focus has been placed on prevention and a behavioral prevention theory.
Social theories.
Looks at external factors in the offender's environment, such as family structure, stress, social learning, and includes rational choice theories. Though these external factors may heighten the frequency and severity of violence, ultimately it is not the cause, but merely fueling the abusers need to seek control in their life else where and enacting that need for control in the only way that they can, which is against their partner.
Resource theory.
Resource theory was suggested by William Goode (1971). Women who are most dependent on the spouse for economic well being (e.g. homemakers/housewives, women with handicaps, the unemployed), and are the primary caregiver to their children, fear the increased financial burden if they leave their marriage. Dependency means that they have fewer options and few resources to help them cope with or change their spouse's behavior.
Couples that share power equally experience lower incidence of conflict, and when conflict does arise, are less likely to resort to violence. If one spouse desires control and power in the relationship, the spouse may resort to abuse. This may include coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, economic abuse, isolation, making light of the situation and blaming the spouse, using children (threatening to take them away), and behaving as "master of the castle".
Social stress.
Stress may be increased when a person is living in a family situation, with increased pressures. Social stresses, due to inadequate finances or other such problems in a family may further increase tensions. Violence is not always caused by stress, but may be one way that some people respond to stress. Families and couples in poverty may be more likely to experience domestic violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other aspects. Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man's ability to live up to his idea of "successful manhood", thus he fears losing honor and respect. Theory suggests that when he is unable to economically support his wife, and maintain control, he may turn to misogyny, substance abuse, and crime as ways to express masculinity.
Social learning theory.
Social learning theory suggests that people learn from observing and modeling after others' behavior. With positive reinforcement, the behavior continues. If one observes violent behavior, one is more likely to imitate it. If there are no negative consequences (e. g. victim accepts the violence, with submission), then the behavior will likely continue. Often, violence is transmitted from generation to generation in a cyclical manner.
Power and control.
In abusive relationships, violence is posited to arise out of a need for power and control of one partner over the other. An abuser will use various tactics of abuse (e.g., physical, verbal, emotional, sexual or financial) in order to establish and maintain control over the partner.
Abusers' efforts to dominate their partners have been attributed to low self-esteem or feelings of inadequacy, unresolved childhood conflicts, the stress of poverty, hostility and resentment toward women (misogyny), hostility and resentment toward men (misandry), personality disorders, genetic tendencies and sociocultural influences, among other possible causative factors. Most authorities seem to agree that abusive personalities result from a combination of several factors, to varying degrees.
A causalist view of domestic violence is that it is a strategy to gain or maintain power and control over the victim. This view is in alignment with Bancroft's "cost-benefit" theory that abuse rewards the perpetrator in ways other than, or in addition to, simply exercising power over his or her target(s). He cites evidence in support of his argument that, in most cases, abusers are quite capable of exercising control over themselves, but choose not to do so for various reasons.
An alternative view is that abuse arises from powerlessness and externalizing/projecting this and attempting to exercise control of the victim. It is an attempt to 'gain or maintain power and control over the victim' but even in achieving this it cannot resolve the powerlessness driving it. Such behaviours have addictive aspects leading to a cycle of abuse or violence. Mutual cycles develop when each party attempts to resolve their own powerlessness in attempting to assert control.
Questions of power and control are integral to the widely utilized Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project. They developed a "Power and Control Wheel" to illustrate this: it has power and control at the center, surrounded by spokes (techniques used), the titles of which include: coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, isolation, minimizing, denying and blaming, using children, economic abuse, and male privilege. The model attempts to address abuse by challenging the misuse of power by the perpetrator.
The power wheel model is not intended to assign personal responsibility, enhance respect for mutual purpose or assist victims and perpetrators in resolving their differences. Rather, it is an informational tool designed to help individuals understand the dynamics of power operating in abusive situations and identify various methods of abuse.
Critics of this model argue that it ignores research linking domestic violence to substance abuse and psychological problems. Some modern research into the patterns in DV has found that women are more likely to be physically abusive towards their partner in relationships in which only one partner is violent, which draws the effectiveness of using concepts like male privilege to treat domestic violence into question; however, it may still be valid in studying severe abuse cases, which are mostly male perpetrated. However, modern research into predictors of injury from domestic violence suggests that the strongest predictor of injury by domestic violence is participation in reciprocal domestic violence.
Gender aspects of abuse.
The relationship between gender and domestic violence is a controversial topic. There continues to be debate about the rates at which each gender is subjected to domestic violence. Reasons for mixed findings include the limitations of existing survey tools (e.g., conflict tactics scale) to measure all relevant aspects of domestic violence and the use of disparate samples in studies. Sociologists Michael P. Johnson and Kathleen J. Ferraro argue that the rate of domestic violence against men is often inflated due to the practice of including self-defense as a form of domestic violence.
Gender differences in reporting violence have been cited as another explanation for mixed results. A 2011 review article by Chan found evidence of gender-specific reporting patterns: men tended to under-report their own perpetration of domestic violence while women were more likely to under-report their victimization. Factors which according to the reviewed studies can lead women to under-report their partner's violence include financial or familial dependence on the abusive partner, the tendency to excuse or normalize the partner's violence with the reasoning that their partner really loves them, and self-blaming. By contrast, men who under-report their own violence may be influenced by the fear and avoidance of legal consequences, the tendency to blame their partner, and a narrative focus on their needs and emotions during reporting. Furthermore, cultural factors can influence men's under-reporting of their own violence. In cultures where machismo is prevalent and where men are considered the head of households in control of their family, wife battering may be not perceived as a serious behavior that needs to report.
According to a 2004 survey in Canada, the percentages of males being physically or sexually victimized by their partners was 6% versus 7% for women. However, females reported higher levels of repeated violence and were more likely than men to experience serious injuries; 23% of females versus 15% of males were faced with the most serious forms of violence including being beaten, choked, or threatened with or having a gun or knife used against them. Also, 21% of women versus 11% of men were likely to report experiencing more than 10 violent incidents. Women who often experience higher levels of physical or sexual violence from their current partner, were 44%, compared with 18% of men to suffer from an injury. Cases in which women are faced with extremely abusive partners, results in the females having to fear for their lives due to the violence they had faced. In addition, statistics show that 34% of women feared for their lives, and 10% of men feared for theirs.
A problem in conducting studies that seek to describe violence in terms of gender is the amount of silence, fear and shame that results from abuse within families and relationships. Another is that abusive patterns can tend to seem normal to those who have lived in them for a length of time. Similarly, subtle forms of abuse can be quite transparent even as they set the stage for further abuse seeming normal. Finally, inconsistent definition of what constitutes domestic violence makes definite conclusions difficult to reach when compiling the available studies.
Violence against women.
Although the exact rates are widely disputed, especially within the United States, there is a large body of cross-cultural evidence that women are subjected to domestic violence significantly more often than men. In addition, there is broad consensus that women are more often subjected to severe forms of abuse and are more likely to be injured by an abusive partner.
According to the 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, a survey of 16,507 Americans by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 30.3% of women and 25.7% of men reported being slapped, pushed, or shoved by a current or former intimate partner in their lifetime, while 24.3% of women and 13.8% of men reported being the victims of severe physical violence. A 2012 survey of over 21,000 residents of England and Wales by the UK Office for National Statistics showed that 7% of women and 5% of men were victims of domestic abuse (defined to include non-physical abuse such as emotional and financial abuse, as well as physical violence) in the last year. A study in the United States found that women were 13 times more likely than men to seek medical attention due to injuries related to spousal abuse.
Women are more likely than men to be murdered by an intimate partner. Of those killed by an intimate partner about three quarters are female and about a quarter are male. In 1999 in the United States 1,218 women and 424 men were killed by an intimate partner, and 1181 females and 329 males were killed by their intimate partners in 2005. In England and Wales about 100 women are killed by partners or former partners each year while 21 men were killed in 2010. In 2008, in France, 156 women and 27 men were killed by their intimate partner.
The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993) states that "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which has led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men". However, more recent research has called into question the notion that sexism and patriarchy are the sole or even primary causes of domestic violence. A 2013 review of studies from five continents examined the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. When DV rates were measured by general population or community studies, there was no correlation. When DV rates were measured by samples of dating couples, gender inequality explained the variance for only 17% of male abuse and 19% of female abuse. The authors conclude that "partner abuse can no longer be conceived as merely a gender problem, but also (and perhaps primarily) as a human and relational problem, and should be framed as such by everyone concerned."
In their study of severely violent couples, Neil Jacobson and John Gottman conclude that the "frequency" of violent acts is not as crucial as the impact of the violence and its function, when trying to understand spousal abuse; specifically, they state that the purpose of domestic violence is typically to control and intimidate, rather than just to injure.
A recent study in South Asia, done in from 2010 to 2013, interviewed 10,000 men from a variety of countries. The study found that "...overall nearly half of those men interviewed reported using physical and/or sexual violence against a female partner, ranging from 26 percent to 80 percent across the sites. Nearly a quarter of men interviewed reported perpetrating rape against a woman or girl, ranging from 10 percent to 62 percent across the sites." 
Violence against men.
Domestic violence against men refers to abuse against men or boys in an intimate relationship such as marriage, cohabitation, dating, or within a family.
Determining how many instances of domestic violence actually involve male victims is difficult. Male domestic violence victims may be reluctant to get help for various reasons. Some studies have shown that women who assaulted their male partners were more likely to avoid arrest even when the male victim contacts police. Another study examined the differences in how male and female batterers were treated by the criminal justice system. The study concluded that female intimate violence perpetrators are frequently viewed by law enforcement and the criminal justice system as victims rather than the actual offenders of violence against men.
Research has suggested that gay men are at higher risk of domestic violence than their heterosexual counterparts.
Same-sex relationships.
Domestic violence occurs in some same-sex relationships. Gay and lesbian relationships have been identified as a risk factor for abuse in certain populations. In an effort to be more inclusive, many organizations have made an effort to use gender-neutral terms when referring to perpetratorship and victimhood.
Historically, domestic violence has been seen as a heterosexual family issue and little interest has been directed at violence in same-sex relationships. It has not been until recently, as the gay rights movement has brought the issues of gay and lesbian people into public attention, when research has been conducted on same-sex relationships. A 1999 analysis of nineteen studies of partner abuse concluded that "esearch suggests that lesbians and gay men are just as likely to abuse their partners as heterosexual men," although the study also noted the uncertain nature of much of the contemporary research in the area.
People in homosexual relationships, however, face special obstacles in dealing with the issues that some researchers have labeled "the double closet". A recent Canadian study by Mark W. Lehman suggests similarities include frequency (approximately one in every four couples); manifestations (emotional, physical, financial, etc.); co-existent situations (unemployment, substance abuse, low self-esteem); victims' reactions (fear, feelings of helplessness, hypervigilance); and reasons for staying (love, can work it out, things will change, denial). At the same time, significant differences, unique issues and deceptive myths are typically present.
Lehman points to added discrimination and fear gay and lesbian people can face. This includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of support from peers who would rather keep quiet about the problem in order not to attract negative attention toward the gay community, the impacts of HIV status or AIDS in keeping partners together, due to health care insurance/access, or guilt; outing used as a weapon, and encountering supportive services that are targeted and/or structured for the needs of heterosexual women and which may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians. However Lehman himself noted that "due to the limited number of returned responses and non-random sampling methodology the findings of this work are not generalizable beyond the sample" of 32 initial respondents and final 10 who completed the more in-depth survey.
Cycle of abuse.
Frequently, domestic violence is used to describe specific violent and overtly abusive incidents, and legal definitions will tend to take this perspective. However, when violent and abusive behaviours happen within a relationship, the effects of those behaviours continue after these overt incidents are over. Advocates and counsellors will refer to domestic violence as a pattern of behaviours, including those listed above.
Lenore Walker presented the model of a Cycle of abuse which consists of three basic phases:
Although it is easy to see the outbursts of the Violent Episode Phase as abuse, even the more pleasant behaviours of the Honeymoon Phase serve to perpetuate the abuse.
Many domestic violence advocates believe that the cycle of abuse theory is limited and does not reflect the realities of many men and women experiencing domestic violence.
Management.
The management of domestic violence differs between societies, and has a very important role in ensuring the well being of the victims and preventing their re-victimization.
The response to domestic violence in Western countries is typically a combined effort between law enforcement, social services, and health care. The role of each has evolved as domestic violence has been brought more into public view.
Domestic violence historically has been viewed as a private family matter that need not involve the government or criminal justice. Police officers were often reluctant to intervene by making an arrest, and often chose instead to simply counsel the couple and/or ask one of the parties to leave the residence for a period of time. The courts were reluctant to impose any significant sanctions on those convicted of domestic violence, largely because it was viewed as a misdemeanor offense.
The modern view in industrialized countries is that domestic violence should be viewed as a public matter and all criminal authority should be involved; that once the violence is reported it should be taken seriously.
Medical response.
Medical professionals can make a difference in the lives of those who experience abuse. Many cases of spousal abuse are handled solely by physicians and do not involve the police. Sometimes cases of domestic violence are brought into the emergency room, while many other cases are handled by a family physician or other primary care provider. Subspecialist physicians are also increasingly playing an important role. For example, HIV physicians are ideally suited to play an important role in managing abuse given the association between abuse and HIV infection as well as their often lifelong relationships with patients.
Duluth model.
The Duluth Model or Domestic Abuse Intervention Project is a program developed to reduce domestic violence against women. The Duluth model was developed by Minnesota Program Development, Inc., a nonprofit agency in Duluth, Minnesota. The program was largely founded by social activist Ellen Pence. The Duluth Model is featured in the documentary "Power and Control: Domestic Violence in America."
The Domestic Abuse Intervention Project was the first multi-disciplinary program designed to address the issue of domestic violence. This experimental program, conducted in Duluth, Minnesota in 1981, coordinated the actions of a variety of agencies dealing with domestic conflict. The program has become a model for programs in other jurisdictions seeking to deal more effectively with domestic violence.
According to the Duluth Model, "women and children are vulnerable to violence because of their unequal social, economic, and political status in society".
The Duluth Model is based on a "violence is patriarchal" model. The model focuses solely on the men's use of violence in abusive relationships, rather than on the behavior of all parties concerned. This helps the men to focus on changing their personal behavior in order to be nonviolent in any relationship.
Law enforcement response.
Law enforcement response to intimate partner violence has varied over time and across jurisdictions. Until the 1980s, U.S. law enforcement policies and practices emphasized not using arrest, prosecution or other legal sanctions. In most U.S. jurisdictions, law enforcement officers were not even authorized to make arrests for any misdemeanor assault, unless it occurred in their presence. In addition, it was widely believed that domestic disturbance calls were the most dangerous type of call for responding officers. This belief was based on FBI statistics which turned out to be flawed, in that they grouped all types of disturbances together with domestic disturbances, such as brawls at a bar. This false belief led to development of programs that trained police officers to first separate intimate partners and to counsel them. The objective of this program was to reduce assaults against and injuries to "law enforcement officers."
Based on legal suits, social research and changing attitudes about the role of women and the social acceptable of the use of violence, law enforcement policies and practices in the U.S. have changed toward encouraging and, in some cases, mandating the use of legal sanctions for intimate partner violence. Many U.S. states have adopted legislation mandating the use of arrest for at least some types of intimate partner violence. In addition, the Federal Violence Against Women Act, first adopted in 1994, promotes the use of arrest and prosecution of intimate partner violence by state and local agencies.
Counseling for person affected.
Due to the extent and prevalence of violence in relationships, counselors and therapists should assess every client for domestic violence (both experienced and perpetrated). If the clinician is seeing a couple for couple’s counseling, this assessment should be conducted with each individual privately during the initial interview, in order to increase the victim’s sense of safety in disclosing DV in the relationship. In addition to determining whether DV is present, counselors and therapists should also make the distinction between situations where battering may have been a single, isolated incident or an ongoing pattern of control. The therapist must, however, consider that domestic violence may be present even when there has been only a single physical incident as emotional/verbal, economic, and sexual abuse may be more insidious.
Lethality assessment.
A lethality assessment is a tool that can assist in determining the best course of treatment for a client, as well as helping the client to recognize dangerous behaviors and more subtle abuse in their relationship. In a study of victims of attempted domestic violence-related homicide, only about one-half of the participants recognized that their perpetrator was capable of killing them, as many domestic violence victims minimize the true seriousness of their situation. Thus, lethality assessment is an essential first step in assessing the severity of a victim’s situation.
Safety planning.
Safety planning allows the victim to plan for dangerous situations they may encounter, and is effective regardless of their decision on whether remain with their perpetrator. Safety planning usually begins with determining a course of action if another acute incident occurs in the home. The victim should be given strategies for their own safety, such as avoiding confrontations in rooms where there is only one exit and avoiding certain rooms that contain many potential weapons (such as kitchens, bathrooms, etc.).
Counseling for offenders.
The main goal for treatment for offenders of domestic violence is to minimize the offender’s risk of future domestic violence, whether within the same relationship or a new one. Treatment for offenders should emphasize minimizing risk to the victim, and should be modified depending on the offender’s history, risk of reoffending, and criminogenic needs. The majority of offender treatment programs are 24–36 weeks in length and are conducted in a group setting with groups not exceeding 12 participants.
Prevention and intervention.
There are many community organizations which work to prevent domestic violence by offering safe shelter, crisis intervention, advocacy, and education and prevention programs. Community screening for domestic violence can be more systematic in cases of animal abuse, healthcare settings, emergency departments, behavioral health settings and court systems. Tools are being developed to facilitate domestic violence screening such as mobile apps.
Pregnancy.
Pregnancy, when coupled with domestic violence, may amplify health risks. Abuse during pregnancy, whether physical, verbal or emotional, produces adverse effects for both the mother and fetus. Domestic violence during pregnancy is categorized as abusive behavior towards a pregnant woman, where the pattern of abuse can often change in terms of severity and frequency of violence. Abuse may be a long-standing problem in a relationship that continues after a woman becomes pregnant or it may commence during pregnancy. Although female-to-male partner violence occurs in these settings, the overwhelming form of domestic violence is perpetrated by men against women.
Domestic abuse can be triggered by pregnancy for various reasons. Pregnancy itself can be used a form of coercion and the phenomenon of preventing an intimate partner’s reproductive choice is referred to as birth control sabotage, or reproductive coercion. Studies on the birth control sabotage performed by males against female partners have indicated a strong correlation between domestic violence and birth control sabotage. Pregnancy can also lead to a hiatus of domestic violence when the abuser does not want to harm the unborn child. The risk of domestic violence for pregnant women is greatest immediately after childbirth.
In 2010, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4.8% of women reported having had an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant against their wishes, while 8.7% of men reported having had an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant against their wishes or tried to stop them from using birth control.
Prognosis.
New research illustrates that there are strong associations between exposure to domestic violence and abuse in all their forms and higher rates of many chronic conditions. The strongest evidence comes from the Adverse Childhood Experiences' series of studies which show correlations between exposure to abuse or neglect and higher rates in adulthood of chronic conditions, high risk health behaviors and shortened life span. Evidence of the association between physical health and violence against women has been accumulating since the early 1990s.
Studies have indicated that it is important to consider the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite traumatized mother's best efforts, interfere with their child's response to the domestic violence and other traumatic events. Thus, practitioners and service agencies addressing the needs of domestic violence victims should assess the victim-as-parent and evaluate the safety and well-being of children in the home.
More recently work by such researchers as Corso have begun to quantify the economic impact of exposure to violence and abuse. A recent publication, "Hidden Costs in Health Care: The Economic Impact of Violence and Abuse, " makes the case that such exposure represents a serious and costly public health issue that should be addressed by the health care system.
Around the world.
In Iraq husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed
while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their
authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".
In Jordan, part of article 340 of the Penal Code states that "he who discovers his wife or one of his female relatives committing adultery and kills, wounds, or injures one of them, is exempted from any penalty." This has twice been put forward for cancellation by the government, but was retained by the Lower House of the Parliament, in 2003: a year in which at least seven honor killings took place. Article 98 of the Penal Code is often cited alongside Article 340 in cases of honor killings. "Article 98 stipulates that a reduced sentence is applied to a person who kills another person in a 'fit of fury'".
In Russia, according to Russian interior ministry estimates, there are 600,000 women victims of domestic abuse every year and 14,000 die from injuries inflicted by husbands or partners each year. Domestic violence is not a specific criminal offense, but it can be charged under various crimes of the criminal code (e.g. assault), but in practice cases of domestic violence turn into criminal cases only when they involve severe injuries, or the victim has died. For more details see Domestic violence in Russia.
A UN report compiled from a number of different studies conducted in at least 71 countries found domestic violence against women to be most prevalent in Ethiopia.
A study on Bedouin women in Israel found that most have experienced DV, most accepted it as a decree from God, and most believed they were to blame themselves for the violence. The study also showed that the majority of women were not aware of existing laws and policies which protect them: 60% said they did not know what a restraining order was.
In the European Union, DV is a serious problem in the Baltic States. These three countries - Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania - have also lagged behind most post-communist countries in their response to DV. The problem in these countries is very severe, and in 2013 a DV victim won a European Court of Human Rights case against Lithuania.
United States.
Approximately 1.3 million women and 835,000 men report being physically assaulted by an intimate partner annually in the United States. In the United States, domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women between the ages of 15 and 44.
Victims of DV are offered legal remedies, which include the criminal law, as well as obtaining a protection order. The remedies offered can be both of a civil nature (civil orders of protection and other protective services) and of a criminal nature (charging the perpetrator with a criminal offense). People perpetrating DV are subject to criminal prosecution, most often under assault and battery laws.
Epidemiology.
Domestic violence occurs across the world, in various cultures, and affects people of all economic statuses. According to one study, the percentage of women who have reported being physically abused by an intimate partner vary from 69% to 10% depending on the country.
Europe.
A 1992 Council of Europe study on domestic violence against women found that 1 in 4 women experience domestic violence over their lifetimes and between 6 and 10% of women suffer domestic violence in a given year.
In Turkey 42% of women over 15 have suffered physical or sexual violence.
North America.
In the United States, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 1995 women reported a six times greater rate of intimate partner violence than men. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) indicates that in 1998 about 876,340 violent crimes were committed in the U.S. against women by their current or former spouses, or boyfriends. According to the Centers for Disease Control, in the United States 4.8 million women suffer intimate partner related physical assaults and rapes and 2.9 million men are victims of physical assault from their partners.
In Canada, the Assembly of First Nations evaluation of the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program conducted by CIET offers an inclusive and relatively unbiased national estimate. It documented domestic violence in a random sample of 85 First Nations across Canada: 22% (523/2359) of mothers reported suffering abuse in the year prior to being interviewed; of these, 59% reported physical abuse.
Asia.
Fighting the prevalence of domestic violence in Kashmir has brought Hindu and Muslim activists together. Additionally, aspects of Islamic law have been criticized for promoting domestic violence
One study found that half of Palestinian women have been the victims of domestic violence.
The Human Rights Watch found that up to 90% of women in Pakistan were subject to some form of maltreatment within their own homes. Honor killings in Pakistan are a very serious problem, especially in northern Pakistan.
In Pakistan, honour killings are known locally as "karo-kari". Karo-kari is a compound word literally meaning "black male" (Karo) and "black female (Kari).
Domestic violence in India is widespread, and is often related to the custom of dowry. Although not as common as in other parts of Asia, honor killings do occur in some regions of India, particularly in northern regions of the country. Honor killings have been reported in the states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, as a result of people marrying without their family's acceptance, and sometimes for marrying outside their caste or religion.
Africa.
Up to two-thirds of women in certain communities in Nigeria's Lagos State say they are victims to domestic violence.
80% of women surveyed in rural Egypt said that beatings were common and often justified, particularly if the woman refused to have sex with her husband.
Oceania.
Statistics published in 2004, show that the rate of domestic violence victimisation for Indigenous women in Australia may be 40 times the rate for non-Indigenous women.
History.
Prior to the mid-1800s, most legal systems accepted wife beating as a valid exercise of a husband's authority over his wife. One exception, however, was the 1641 Body of Liberties of the Massachusetts Bay colonists, which declared that a married woman should be "free from bodilie correction or stripes by her husband."
Political agitation during the nineteenth century led to changes in both popular opinion and legislation regarding domestic violence within the United Kingdom and the United States. In 1850, Tennessee became the first state in the United States to explicitly outlaw wife beating. Other states soon followed suit. In 1878, the Matrimonial Causes Act made it possible for women in the UK to seek separations from abusive husbands. By the end of the 1870s, most courts in the United States were uniformly opposed to the right of husbands to physically discipline their wives. By the early twentieth century, it was common for police to intervene in cases of domestic violence in the United States, but arrests remained rare.
Modern attention to domestic violence began in the women's movement of the 1970s, particularly within the contexts of feminism and women's rights, as concern about wives being beaten by their husbands gained attention. The first known use of the expression "domestic violence" in a modern context, meaning "spouse abuse, violence in the home" was in an address to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1973. A few months later the world's first domestic violence services federation (Women's Aid) was set up in 1974, providing practical and emotional support as part of a range of services to women and children experiencing violence in England. With the rise of the men's movement of the 1990s, the problem of domestic violence against men also gained significant attention.
Until quite recently, children had very few rights in regard to protection from violence by their parents, and still continue to do so in many parts of the world. Historically, fathers had virtually unlimited rights in regard to their children and how they chose to discipline them. In many cultures, such as in Ancient Rome, a father could legally kill his children; many cultures have also allowed fathers to sell their children into slavery. Child sacrifice was also a common practice. Today, corporal punishment of children by their parents remains legal in most countries, but in Western countries that still allow the practice there are strict limits on what is permitted. The first country to outlaw parental corporal punishment was Sweden (parents' right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966, and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July 1979).

HSC Cyclades Express

Cyclades Express is a high speed catamaran operated by NEL Lines in the Aegean.
History.
The Cyclades Express was built in 1992 as Seacat Scotland for Sea Containers. She was built to inaugurate a new fast ferry service between Stranraer and Belfast. Before commencing service on the North Channel she briefly operated on the Dover to Calais route for Hoverspeed.
During the winter of 1994/1995 she was chartered to middle eastern operator Q Ships for service across the Red Sea. for this role she was renamed Q Ship Express. During her charter the Stranraer – Belfast route was operated by Seacat Isle of Man. On completion of the charter she returned to the Stranraer – Belfast route, changing back to her original name.
"Seacat Scotland" was chartered again during the winter of 1997/1998. This time to Uruguayan ferry operator Navegacion Atlantida S.A. for service on the River Plate. She returned to the North Channel for the 1998 summer season. Sea Containers left Stranraer in 2000 in favour of Troon following heavy competition from Stena Line and P&O Irish Sea at Loch Ryan. "Seacat Scotland" operated the Belfast – Troon route until 2003 when she was replaced by the "Rapide".
"Seacat Scotland" transferred to the Hoverspeed Dover – Calais route which she operated with "Seacat Danmark" and "Seacat France". She remained on the English Channel until September 2005 when she was once again replaced by the "Rapide".
She left Dover in September 2004 bound for the Pallion shipyard in Sunderland. She remained dry docked in Sunderland until she was sold to Fortune Maritime Enterprises . She left Sunderland in April 2007 bound for Keratsini as the Shikra. Before entering service between Safaga and Dhuba she was renamed Al Huda I.
In July 2010 the "Al Huda I" arrived in Perama. During her refit she was repainted in NEL Lines livery and renamed Cyclades Express. During her first season with Nel Lines she is doing day trips between Crete and Santorini.

Athericidae

Athericidae is a small family of flies known as water snipe flies or ibis flies. They used to be placed in the family Rhagionidae, but were removed by Stuckenberg in 1973. They are now known to be more closely related to Tabanidae. Species of Athericidae are found worldwide. The adults mostly feed on nectar but some species feed on mammal blood. Hematophagy has been demonstrated in adult "Suragina" and "Suraginella" and is suspected in other genera. The larvae have distinctive morphology; they have long abdominal prolegs with crocheted hooks. These structures help the larvae move without being washed away in their preferred larval habitat, fast flowing montane streams and torrents. The larvae are predators of other aquatic invertebrates such as caddisflies.
There are two subfamilies; Dasyommatinae contains only "Dasyomma" and all other extant genera are in Athericinae.

La Jalousie

La Jalousie is a 1957 novel by Alain Robbe-Grillet. The title of its English editions is "Jealousy", but this fails to capture the ambiguity of the French title: "la jalousie" can be translated as "jealousy", but also as "the jalousie window". And the jealous husband in the novel spies on his wife through the Venetian blind-like slats of the jalousie windows of their home.
"La Jalousie" is one of critics' and literary theorists' main examples of Robbe-Grillet's demonstrations of his concept of the nouveau roman, for which he later explicitly advocated in his 1963 "Pour un nouveau roman" ("For a New Novel").
Robbe-Grillet argued that the novel was constructed along the lines of an "absent" third-person narrator. In that account of the novel the narrator, a jealous husband, silently observes the interactions of his wife (referred to only as "A...") and a neighbour, Franck. The silent narrator, who never names himself (and whose presence is merely inferred, e.g. by the number of place settings at the dinner table or deck chairs on the verandah) is extremely suspicious that A... is having an affair with Franck. Throughout the novel, he continually replays his observations and suspicions (that is, created scenarios about A... and Franck) so much so that it becomes impossible to distinguish moments that are observed from those that are merely suspected.

Pickled cucumber

A pickled cucumber (commonly known as a pickle in the United States and Canada or generically as gherkins in the United Kingdom) is a cucumber that has been pickled in a brine, vinegar, or other solution and left to ferment for a period of time, by either immersing the cucumbers in an acidic solution or through souring by lacto-fermentation.
Types.
Gherkin.
A gherkin is not only a pickle of a certain size but also a particular species of cucumber: the West Indian or Burr Gherkin ("Cucumis anguria"), which produces a somewhat smaller fruit than the garden cucumber ("Cucumis sativus"). Standard pickles are made from the Burr Gherkin, but the term "gherkin" has become loosely used as any small cucumber pickled in a vinegar brine, regardless of the variety of cucumber used.
Cornichon.
Cornichons are tart French pickles made from small gherkins pickled in vinegar and tarragon. They traditionally accompany pâtés.
Brined pickles.
Brined pickles are prepared using the traditional process of natural fermentation in a brine which makes them grow sour. The brine concentration can vary between 20 g/litre to more than 40 g/litre of salt. There is no vinegar used in the brine of naturally fermented pickled cucumbers.
The fermentation process is entirely dependent on the naturally occurring Lactobacillus bacteria that normally cover the skin of a growing cucumber. Since these are routinely removed during commercial harvesting/packing processes, traditionally prepared pickles can only be made from freshly harvested cucumbers, unless the bacteria are artificially replaced.
Typically, small cucumbers are placed in a glass or ceramic vessel or a wooden barrel, together with a variety of spices. Among those traditionally used in many recipes are garlic, horseradish, whole dill stems with umbels and green seeds, white mustard seeds, grape, oak, cherry, blackcurrant and bay laurel leaves, dried allspice fruits, and—most importantly—salt. The container is then filled with cooled, boiled water and kept under a non-airtight cover (often cloth tied on with string or a rubber band) for several weeks, depending on taste and external temperature. Traditionally stones, also sterilized by boiling, are placed on top of the cucumbers to keep them under the water. The more salt is added the more sour the cucumbers become.
Since they are produced without vinegar, a film of bacteria forms on the top, but this does not indicate they have spoiled, and the film is simply removed. They do not, however, keep as long as cucumbers pickled with vinegar, and usually must be refrigerated. Some commercial manufacturers add vinegar as a preservative.
Kosher dill (US).
A "kosher" dill pickle is not necessarily kosher in the sense that it has been prepared in accordance with Jewish dietary law. Rather, it is a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, with generous addition of garlic and dill to a natural salt brine.
In New York terminology, a "full-sour" kosher dill is one that has fully fermented, while a "half-sour," given a shorter stay in the brine, is still crisp and bright green. Elsewhere, these pickles may sometimes be termed "old" and "new" dills.
Dill pickles (not necessarily described as "kosher") have been served in New York City since at least 1899. They are not, however, native to New York; they have been prepared in Russia, Ukraine, Germany and Poland for hundreds of years.
Polish.
The Polish-style pickled cucumber () is a variety developed in the northern parts of Europe. It has been exported worldwide and is found in the cuisines of many countries. It is sour, similar to kosher dills, but tends to be seasoned differently. It is usually preserved in wooden barrels. A cucumber only pickled for a few days is different in taste (less sour) than one pickled for a longer time and is called "ogórek małosolny", which literally means 'low-salt cucumber'. This distinction is similar to the one between half- and full-sour types of kosher dills (see above).
Another kind of pickled cucumber, popular in Poland, is "ogórek konserwowy" ('preserved cucumber') which is rather sweet and vinegary in taste, due to different composition of the preserving solution. It is kept in jars instead of barrels or cans.
Hungarian.
In Hungary, while regular vinegar-pickled cucumbers () are made during most of the year, during the summer "kovászos uborka" ("leavened pickles") are made without the use of vinegar. Cucumbers are placed in a glass vessel along with spices (usually dill and garlic), water and salt. Additionally, a slice or two of bread are placed at the top and bottom of the solution, and the container is left to sit in the sun for a few days so the yeast in the bread can help cause a fermentation process.
Lime.
Lime pickles are soaked in lime rather than in a salt brine. This is done more to enhance texture (by making them crisper) rather than as a preservative. The lime is then rinsed off the pickles. Vinegar and sugar are often added after the 24-hour soak in lime, along with pickling spices.
Bread and butter.
Bread-and-butter pickles are sweeter in flavor than dill pickles, having a high concentration of sugar or other sweetener added to the brine. Cucumbers to be made into bread and butters are often sliced before pickling.
Swedish and Danish.
Swedish pickled cucumbers ("pressgurka") are thinly sliced, mixed with salt and pressed to drain some water from the cucumber slices. Afterwards placed in a jar with a sour-sweet brine of vinegar, sugar, dill and mustard seeds.
Danish cucumber salad ("agurkesalat") is similar, but the cucumbers are not pressed and the brine doesn't have parsley. The cucumber salad accompanies meat dishes, especially a roasted chicken dish ("gammeldags kylling med agurkesalat"), and is used on Danish hot dogs.
Kool-Aid pickles.
Kool-Aid pickles or "koolickles", enjoyed by children in parts of the Southern United States, are created by soaking dill pickles in a mixture of Kool-Aid and pickle brine.
Nutrition.
Like pickled vegetables such as sauerkraut, sour pickled cucumbers (technically a fruit) are low in calories. They also contain a moderate amount of vitamin K, specifically in the form of K1. One sour pickled cucumber "spear" offers 12–16 µg, or approximately 15–20%, of the Recommended Daily Allowance of vitamin K. It also offers three kilocalories, most of which come from carbohydrate. However, most sour pickled cucumbers are also high in sodium; one spear can contain 350–500 mg, or 15–20% of the American recommended daily limit of 2400 mg.
Sweet pickled cucumbers, including bread-and-butter pickles, are higher in calories due to their sugar content; one large gherkin may contain 20-30 calories. However, sweet pickled cucumbers also tend to contain significantly less sodium than sour pickles.
Serving.
In the United States, pickles are often served as a side dish accompanying meals. This often takes the form of a "pickle spear", which is a pickled cucumber cut length-wise into quarters or sixths. Pickles may be used as a condiment on a hamburger or other sandwich (usually in slice form), or on a sausage or hot dog in chopped form as pickle relish.
Soured cucumbers are commonly used in a variety of dishes—for example, pickle-stuffed meatloaf, potato salad or chicken salad—or consumed alone as an appetizer.
Pickles are sometimes served alone as festival foods, often on a stick. This is also done in Japan, where it is referred to as .
Dill pickles can be fried, typically deep-fried with a breading or batter surrounding the spear or slice. This is a popular dish in the Southern U.S., and a rising trend elsewhere in the US.
In Russia and Ukraine, pickles are used in rassolnik: a traditional soup made from pickled cucumbers, pearl barley, pork or beef kidneys, and various herbs. The dish is known to have existed as far back as the 15th century, when it was called kalya.
Pickle etymology.
The term "pickle" is derived from the Dutch word "pekel", meaning "brine". In the U.S. and Canada, the word "pickle" alone almost always refers to a pickled cucumber (other types of pickles will be described as "pickled onion," "pickled beets," etc.). In the UK "pickle" generally refers to ploughman's pickle, such as Branston pickle, traditionally served with a ploughman's lunch.

<doc id="18978679" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18978679" title="Hokkien dialect">
Hokkien dialect

Hokkien () or Quanzhou–Zhangzhou (Chinchew-Changchew; BP: ) is a group of mutually intelligible Min Nan Chinese dialects spoken by many overseas Chinese throughout Southeast Asia. Hokkien originated from a dialect in southern Fujian. It is closely related to the Teochew, though mutual comprehension is difficult, and is somewhat more distantly related to Hainanese. The Amoy and Taiwanese prestige dialect (based on Tainan variant) are considered standards. To clarify, besides Hokkien, there are also other dialects in Fujian province.
Names.
The term "Hokkien" (; ) is itself a term not used in Chinese to describe the dialect as it simply means Fujian province. In Chinese linguistics, these dialects are known by their classification under the Quanzhang Division () of Min Nan, which comes from the first characters of the two main Hokkien urban centers Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. The language is also known by other terms such as the more general Min Nan () or Southern Min, and Fulaohua (). The term Hokkien (;Tâi-lô:"Hok-kiàn-uē"), on the other hand, is used commonly in South East Asia to refer to Min-nan dialects.
Geographic distribution.
Hokkien originated in the Southern region of Fujian province, an important centre for trade and migration, and has since spread beyond China, being one of the most common Chinese languages overseas.
A form of Hokkien akin to that spoken in southern Fujian is also spoken in Republic of China (Taiwan), where it goes by the name Tâi-oân-oē or Hō-ló-oē. The ethnic group for which Hokkien is considered the native language is the Holo or Hoklo, the main ethnicity of Taiwan. The correspondence between language and ethnicity is not absolute, as some Hoklo people have limited proficiency in Hokkien while some non-Hoklos are fluent in the dialect.
There are many Hokkien speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia as well as in the United States. Many ethnic Chinese emigrants to the region were Hoklo from southern Fujian, and brought the language to what is now Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia (the former Dutch East Indies) and present day Malaysia and Singapore (formerly Malaya and the British Straits Settlements). Many of the Hokkien dialects of this region are highly similar to Taiwanese and Amoy. Hokkien is reportedly the native language of up to 98.5% of the Chinese Filipino in the Philippines, among which is known locally as Lan-nang or Lán-lâng-oē ("Our people’s language"). Hokkien speakers form the largest group of Chinese in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Classification.
Southern Fujian is home to three principal Hokkien dialects. They are known by the geographic locations to which they correspond (listed north to south):
As Amoy/Xiamen is the principal city of southern Fujian, the Amoy dialect is considered the most important, or even the prestige dialect, of Hokkien. It's a hybrid of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. It has played an influential role in history, especially in the relations of Western nations with China, and was one of the most frequently learned of all Chinese languages/dialects by Westerners during the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century.
The varieties of Hokkien spoken in Taiwan are similar to the three varieties of Fujian, and are collectively known as Taiwanese. Taiwanese is used by a majority of the population and bears much importance from a socio-political perspective, forming the second (and perhaps today most significant) major pole of the language. The varieties of Hokkien in Southeast Asia, including Singaporean Hokkien, also originate from these dialects.
History.
Variants of Hokkien dialects can be traced to two sources of origin: Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. Both Amoy and Taiwanese are based on a mixture of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects, while the rest of the Hokkien dialects spoken in South East Asia are either derived from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, or based on a mixture of both dialects.
Quanzhou.
During the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China, there was constant warfare occurring in the Central Plain of China. Northerners began to enter into Fujian region, causing the region to incorporate parts of northern Chinese dialects. However, the massive migration of northern Han Chinese into Fujian region mainly occurred after the Disaster of Yongjia. The Jìn court fled from the north to the south, causing large numbers of northern Han Chinese to move into Fujian region. They brought the old Chinese — spoken in Central Plain of China from prehistoric era to 3rd century — into Fujian. This then gradually evolved into the Quanzhou dialect.
Zhangzhou.
In 677 (during the reign of Emperor Gaozong), Chen Zheng (陳政), together with his son Chen Yuanguang (陳元光), led a military expedition to pacify the rebellion in Fujian. They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou; In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao (王潮) and Wang Shenzhi (王審知), led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou. These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the northern Middle Chinese languages into Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect.
Xiamen.
Xiamen dialect, sometimes known as Amoy, is the main dialect spoken in the Chinese city of Xiamen and its surrounding regions of Tong'an and Xiang'an, both of which are now included in the Greater Xiamen area. This dialect developed in the late Ming dynasty when Xiamen was increasingly taking over Quanzhou's position as the main port of trade in southeastern China. Quanzhou traders began travelling southwards to Xiamen to carry on their businesses while Zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities. It is at this time when a need for a common language arose. The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways (as can be seen from the common place of Henan Luoyang where they originated), but due to differences in accents, communication can be a problem. Quanzhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered Zhangzhou's to be a village dialect. Over the centuries, dialect leveling occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the Amoy dialect.
Hokkien linguistics classics.
Chinese scholars of late Ming and Qing systematically studied the Hokkien dialects of those times and compiled a number of Chinese linguistics books about Hokkien. These include "The Phonology of Quanzhou speech" (彙音妙悟) by Huang Qian (黃謙), "The Phonology of common Zhangzhou speech" (彙集雅俗通十五音) by Xie Xiulan (謝秀嵐) etc.
Phonology.
Hokkien has one of the most diverse phoneme inventories among Chinese languages, with more consonants than Standard Mandarin or Cantonese. Vowels are more or less similar to that of Standard Mandarin. Hokkien varieties retain many pronunciations that are no longer found in other Chinese dialects. These include the retention of the initial, which is now (Pinyin 'zh') in Mandarin (e.g. 'bamboo' 竹 is "tik", but "zhú" in Mandarin), having disappeared before the 6th century in other Chinese dialects.
Initials.
Southern Min has aspirated, unaspirated as well as voiced consonant initials. For example, the word "khui" () (meaning "open") and "kuiⁿ" () (meaning "close") have the same vowel but differ only by aspiration of the initial and nasality of the vowel. In addition, Southern Min has labial initial consonants such as m in "m̄-sī" () (meaning "is not").
Another example is ' () (meaning "boy") and ' () (meaning "girl"), which differ in the second syllable in consonant voicing and in tone.
Finals.
Unlike Mandarin, Southern Min retains all the final consonants of Middle Chinese. While Mandarin only preserves the n and ŋ finals, Southern Min also preserves the m, p, t and k finals and developed the ʔ (glottal stop).
Tones.
In general, Hokkien dialects have 5 to 7 phonemic tones. According to the traditional Chinese system, however, there are 7 to 9 "tones", more correctly termed "tone classes" since two of them are non-phonemic "entering tones" (see the discussion on Chinese tone). Tone sandhi is extensive. There are minor variations between the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou tone systems. Taiwanese tones follow the patterns of Amoy or Quanzhou, depending on the area of Taiwan. Quanzhou is the only Hokkien dialect that preserves all 6 phonemic tones of Late Middle Chinese (LMC); both Amoy and Taiwanese Hokkien typically have 5 phonemic tones, having lost LMC tone 6. Many dialects have an additional phonemic tone ("tone 9" according to the traditional reckoning), used only in special or foreign loan words.
Comparison.
The Amoy dialect (Xiamen) is a hybrid of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. Taiwanese is also a hybrid of these two dialects. Taiwanese in northern Taiwan tends to be based on the Quanzhou variety, whereas the Taiwanese spoken in southern Taiwan tends to be based on Zhangzhou's. There are minor variations in pronunciation and vocabulary between Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. The grammar is generally the same. Additionally, Taiwanese includes several dozen loanwords from Japanese as well as Taiwanese aboriginal languages. On the other hand, the variants spoken in Singapore and Malaysia have a substantial number of loanwords from Malay and to a lesser extent, from English and other Chinese dialects such as the closely related Teochew and some Cantonese.
Mutual intelligibility.
The Quanzhou dialect, Xiamen dialect, Zhangzhou dialect, Taiwanese, Penang Hokkien, Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien and Singaporean Hokkien are mutually intelligible.
The Min Nan varieties of Teochew and Amoy are 84% phonetically similar, and 34% lexically similar, whereas Mandarin and Amoy Min Nan are 62% phonetically similar and 15% lexically similar. In comparison, German and English are 60% lexically similar.
Grammar.
Hokkien dialects are analytic; in a sentence, the arrangement of words is important to its meaning. A basic sentence follows the subject–verb–object pattern (i.e. a subject is followed by a verb then by an object), though this order is often violated because Hokkien dialects are topic-prominent. Unlike synthetic languages, seldom do words indicate time, gender and plural by inflection. Instead, these concepts are expressed through adverbs, aspect markers, and grammatical particles, or are deduced from the context. Different particles are added to a sentence to further specify its status or intonation.
A verb itself indicates no grammatical tense. The time can be explicitly shown with time-indicating adverbs. Certain exceptions exist, however, according to the pragmatic interpretation of a verb's meaning. Additionally, an optional aspect particle can be appended to a verb to indicate the state of an action. Appending interrogative or exclamative particles to a sentence turns a statement into a question or shows the attitudes of the speaker.
Hokkien dialects preserve certain grammatical reflexes and patterns reminiscent of the broad stage of Archaic Chinese. This includes the serialization of verb phrases (direct linkage of verbs and verb phrases) and the infrequency of nominalization, both similar to Archaic Chinese grammar.
Choice of grammatical function words also varies significantly among the Hokkien dialects. For instance, 乞 "khit" (denoting the causative, passive or dative) is retained in Jinjiang (also unique to the Jinjiang dialect is 度 "thoo") and Jieyang, but not in Longxi and Xiamen, whose dialects use 互 ("hoo") instead.
Pronouns.
Hokkien dialects differ in their preferred choice of pronouns. For instance, while the second person pronoun "lí" (你) is standard in Taiwanese Hokkien, the Teochew loanword "lú" (汝) is more common among Hokkien-speaking communities in Southeast Asia. The plural personal pronouns tend to be nasalized forms of the singular ones. Personal pronouns found in the Hokkien dialects are listed below:
Possessive pronouns are marked by the particle "ê" (的), or its literary version "chi" (之). Plural pronouns are typically unmarked (the nasalized final serves as the possessive indicator):
Reflexive pronouns are made by appending the pronouns "ka-kī, ka-tī" (家己) or "chū-kí" (自己).
Hokkien dialects use a variety of differing demonstrative pronouns, which are as follows:
The interrogative pronouns are:
Copula ("to be").
States and qualities are generally expressed using stative verbs that do not require the verb "to be":
With noun complements, the verb "sī" (是) serves as the verb "to be".
To indicate location, the words "tī" (佇) "tiàm" (踮), "teh/leh" (咧), which are collectively known as the locatives or sometimes coverbs in Chinese linguistics, are used to express "(to be) at":
Negation.
Hokkien dialects have a variety of negation particles that are prefixed or affixed to the verbs they modify. There are five primary negation particles in Hokkien dialects:
Other negative particles include:
The particles "m̄" (毋, 呣, 唔) is general and can negate almost any verb:
The particle "mài" (莫, 勿), a concatenation of "m-ài" (毋愛) is used to negate imperative commands:
The particle "bô" (無) indicates the past tense:
The verb 'to have', "ū" (有) is replaced by "bô" (無) when negated (not 無有):
The particle "put" (不) is used infrequently, mostly found in literary compounds and phrases:
Vocabulary.
The majority of Hokkien vocabulary is monosyllabic. Many Hokkien words have cognates in other Chinese languages. That said, there are also many indigenous words that are unique to Hokkien and are not potentially of Sino-Tibetan origin, while others are shared by all the Min languages (e.g. 'congee' is 糜 "mê", "bôe", "bê", not 粥 "zhōu", as in other dialects).
As compared to Standard Chinese (Mandarin), Hokkien dialects prefer the usage the monosyllabic form of words, without suffixes. For instance, the Mandarin noun suffix 子 (zi) is not found in Hokkien words, while another noun suffix, 仔 (á) is used in many nouns. Examples are below:
In other bisyllabic morphemes, the syllables are inverted, as compared to Standard Chinese. Examples include the following:
In other cases, the same word can have different meanings in Hokkien and standard written Chinese. Similarly, depending on the region Hokkien is spoken in, loanwords from local languages (Malay, Tagalog, Burmese, among others), as well as other Chinese dialects (such as Southern Chinese dialects like Cantonese and Teochew), are commonly integrated into the vocabulary of Hokkien dialects.
Literary and colloquial readings.
The existence of literary and colloquial readings (), called "tha̍k-im" (讀音), is a prominent feature of some Hokkien dialects and indeed in many Sinitic varieties in the south. The bulk of literary readings (, "bûn-tha̍k"), based on pronunciations of the vernacular during the Tang Dynasty, are mainly used in formal phrases and written language (e.g. philosophical concepts, surnames, and some place names), while the colloquial (or vernacular) ones (, "pe̍h-tha̍k") are basically used in spoken language and vulgar phrases. Literary readings are more similar to the pronunciations of the Tang standard of Middle Chinese than their colloquial equivalents. 
However, some dialects of Hokkien, such as Penang Hokkien as well as Philippine Hokkien (Lan-lang-oe) overwhelmingly favor colloquial readings. For example, in both Penang Hokkien and Philippine Hokkien, the characters for 'university,' 大學, are pronounced "toā-ȯh" (colloquial readings for both characters), instead of the literary reading "tāi-hȧk", which is common in Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese dialects.
The pronounced divergence between literary and colloquial pronunciations found in Hokkien dialects is attributed to the presence of several strata in the Min lexicon. The earliest, colloquial stratum is traced to the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE); the second colloquial one comes from the period of the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420 - 589 CE); the third stratum of pronunciations (typically literary ones) comes from the Tang Dynasty and is based on the prestige dialect of Chang'an (modern day Xi'an), its capital.
Some commonly seen sound correspondences (colloquial → literary) are as follows:
This table displays some widely used characters in Hokkien that have both literary and colloquial readings:
This feature extends to Chinese numerals, which have both literary and colloquial readings. Literary readings are typically used when the numerals are read out loud (e.g. phone numbers), while colloquial readings are used for counting items.
Semantic differences between Hokkien and Mandarin.
Quite a few words from the variety of Old Chinese spoken in the state of Wu (where the ancestral language of Min and Wu dialect families originated and which was likely influenced by the Chinese spoken in the state of Chu which itself was not founded by Chinese speakers), and later words from Middle Chinese as well, have retained the original meanings in Hokkien, while many of their counterparts in Mandarin Chinese have either fallen out of daily use, have been substituted with other words (some of which are borrowed from other languages while others are new developments), or have developed newer meanings. The same may be said of Hokkien as well, since some lexical meaning evolved in step with Mandarin while others are wholly innovative developments.
This table shows some Hokkien dialect words from Classical Chinese, as contrasted to the written Chinese standard, Mandarin:
For other words, the classical Chinese meanings of certain words, which are retained in Hokkien dialects, have evolved or deviated significantly in other Chinese dialects. The following table shows some words that are both used in both Hokkien dialects and Mandarin Chinese, while the meanings in Mandarin Chinese have been modified:
Words from Minyue.
Some commonly used words, shared by all Min languages, came from the ancient Minyue languages. They include the following examples, compared to the Fuzhou dialect, a Min Dong language:
1 "lâng" is now typically represented by 人 (literary reading "jîn").
Loanwords.
Loanwords are not unusual among Hokkien dialects, as speakers readily adopted indigenous terms of the languages they came in contact with. As a result, there is a plethora of loanwords that are not mutually comprehensible among Hokkien dialects.
Taiwanese Hokkien, as a result of linguistic contact with Japanese and aboriginal languages, contains many loanwords from these languages. Among these include the following examples:
Singaporean Hokkien and Malaysian Hokkien dialects like Penang Hokkien tend to draw loanwords from Malay, English as well as other Chinese dialects, primarily Teochew. Examples include:
Philippine Hokkien dialects, as a result of centuries-old contact with both Philippine language and Spanish also incorporate words from these languages. Examples include:
Standard Hokkien.
After the Opium War in 1842, Xiamen (Amoy) became one of the major treaty ports to be opened for trade with the outside world. From mid-19th century onwards, Xiamen slowly developed to become the political, economical and cultural center of the Hokkien-speaking region in China. This caused Amoy dialect to gradually become the "Prestige Standard Hokkien", thus replacing the position of dialect variants from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. Up to today, it is still being regarded as the representative Standard Hokkien dialect. From mid-19th century until the end of World War II, western diplomats usually learned Amoy Hokkien as the preferred dialect if they were to communicate with the Hokkien-speaking populace in China or South-East Asia. In the 1940s and 1950s, Taiwan also held Amoy Hokkien as its standard and tended to incline itself towards Amoy dialect.
However, from the 1980s onwards, the development of Hokkien entertainment and media industry in Taiwan caused the Hokkien cultural hub to shift from Xiamen to Taiwan. The flourishing Hokkien entertainment and media industry from Taiwan in the 1990s and early 21st century led Taiwan to emerge as the new significant cultural hub for Hokkien.
In the 1990s, marked by the liberalization of language development and mother tongue movement in Taiwan, Taiwanese Hokkien had undergone a fast pace in its development. In 1993, Taiwan became the first region in the world to implement the teaching of Taiwanese Hokkien in Taiwanese schools. In 2001, the local Taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien became one of the compulsory local Taiwanese languages to be learned in schools. The mother tongue movement in Taiwan even influenced Xiamen (Amoy) to the point that in 2010, Xiamen also began to implement the teaching of Hokkien dialect in its schools. In 2007, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan also completed the standardization of Chinese characters used for writing Hokkien and developed Tai-lo as the standard Hokkien pronunciation and romanization guide. A number of universities in Taiwan also offer Hokkien degree courses for training Hokkien language talents to work for the Hokkien media industry and education. Taiwan also has its own Hokkien literary and cultural circles whereby Hokkien poets and writers compose poetry or literature in Hokkien on a regular basis.
Thus by the 21st century, Taiwan has truly emerged as one of the most significant Hokkien cultural hub of the world. Although Amoy Hokkien continued to be regarded as the historical "Prestige Standard Hokkien", the historical changes and development in Taiwan had led Taiwanese Hokkien to become the more influential pole of the Hokkien dialect after mid-20th century. Today, Taiwanese prestige dialect (Taiyu Youshiqiang/Tongxinqiang 台語優勢腔/通行腔), which is based on Tainan variant and heard on Taiwanese Hokkien media, has also become one of the major "Standard Hokkien" along with Amoy.
Writing systems.
Chinese script.
Hokkien dialects are typically written using Chinese characters (漢字, "Hàn-jī"). However, the written script was and remains adapted to the literary form, which is based on classical Chinese, not the vernacular and spoken form. Furthermore, the character inventory used for Mandarin (standard written Chinese) does not correspond to Hokkien words, and there are a large number of informal characters (替字, "thè-jī" or "thuè-jī"; 'substitute characters') which are unique to Hokkien (as is the case with Cantonese). For instance, about 20 to 25% of Taiwanese morphemes lack an appropriate or standard Chinese character.
While most Hokkien morphemes have standard designated characters, they are not always etymological or phono-semantic. Similar-sounding, similar-meaning or rare characters are commonly borrowed or substituted to represent a particular morpheme. Examples include "beautiful" (美 "bí" is the literary form), whose vernacular morpheme "suí" is represented by characters like 媠 (an obsolete character), 婎 (a vernacular reading of this character) and even 水 (transliteration of the sound "suí"), or "tall" (高 "ko" is the literary form), whose morpheme "kuân" is 懸. Common grammatical particles are not exempt; the negation particle "m̄" (not) is variously represented by 毋, 呣 or 唔, among others. In other cases, characters are invented to represent a particular morpheme (a common example is the character 𪜶 "in", which represents the personal pronoun "they"). In addition, some characters have multiple and unrelated pronunciations, adapted to represent Hokkien words, such as 肉 for "bah" ("meat"), although it also has distinct colloquial and literary readings as well ("hi̍k" and "jio̍k, lio̍k" respectively). Another case is the word 'to eat,' "chia̍h", which is often transcribed in Taiwanese newspapers and media as 呷 (a Mandarin transliteration, "xiā", to approximate the Hokkien term), even though its recommended character in dictionaries is 食.
Moreover, unlike Cantonese, Hokkien does not have a universally accepted standardized character set. Thus, there is some variation in the characters used to express certain words and characters can be ambiguous in meaning. In 2007, the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China formulated and released a standard character set to overcome these difficulties. These standard Chinese characters for writing Taiwanese Hokkien are now taught in schools in Taiwan.
Latin script.
Hokkien, especially Taiwanese, is sometimes written in the Latin script using one of several alphabets. Of these the most popular is Pe̍h-ōe-jī (). POJ was developed first by Presbyterian missionaries in China and later by the indigenous Presbyterian Church in Taiwan; use of this alphabet has been actively promoted since the late 19th century. The use of a mixed script of Han characters and Latin letters is also seen, though remains uncommon. Other Latin-based alphabets also exist.
Minnan texts, all Hokkien, can be dated back to the 16th century. One example is the "Doctrina Christiana en letra y lengua china", presumably written after 1587 by the Spanish Dominicans in the Philippines. Another is a Ming Dynasty script of a play called "Romance of the Lychee Mirror" (1566), supposedly the earliest Southern Min colloquial text. Xiamen University has also developed an alphabet based on Pinyin, which has been published in a dictionary called the "Minnan Fangyan-Putonghua Cidian" (閩南方言普通話詞典) and a language teaching book, which is used to teach the language to foreigners and Chinese non-speakers. It is known as Pumindian.
Taiwan has also developed a Latin alphabet for Taiwanese Hokkien, derived from Pe̍h-ōe-jī. It is known as Tai-lo and since 2006 has been officially promoted by Taiwan's Ministry of Education and taught in Taiwanese schools.
Computing.
Hokkien is registered as "Southern Min" per RFC 3066 as zh-min-nan.
When writing Hokkien in Chinese characters, some writers create 'new' characters when they consider it impossible to use directly or borrow existing ones; this corresponds to similar practices in character usage in Cantonese, Vietnamese chữ nôm, Korean hanja and Japanese kanji. Some of these are not encoded in Unicode (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: Universal Character Set), thus creating problems in computer processing.
All Latin characters required by Pe̍h-ōe-jī can be represented using Unicode (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: Universal Character Set), using precomposed or combining (diacritics) characters. Prior to June 2004, the vowel akin to but more open than "o", written with a dot above right, was not encoded. The usual workaround was to use the (stand-alone; spacing) character "Interpunct" (U+00B7, "·") or less commonly the combining character "dot above" (U+0307). As these are far from ideal, since 1997 proposals have been submitted to the ISO/IEC working group in charge of ISO/IEC 10646—namely, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2—to encode a new combining character "dot above right". This is now officially assigned to U+0358 (see documents N1593, N2507, N2628,
N2699, and N2713). Font support is expected to follow.

Surajit Chandra Sinha

Surajit Chandra Sinha (1926–2002) was an Indian anthropologist and a former Maharajkumar of Susang in undivided Bengal.
Background.
He was born in Mymensingh District (currently in Bangladesh) in 1926. He was the eldest son of Maharaja Bhupendra Chandra Sinha, the Maharaja of Susang, who was a well known artist and who had studied in Presidency College, Calcutta. Sinha's mother belonged to the zamindari family of Sithlai in Pabna district. Sinha's youngest sister is Purba Dam, the eminent exponent of Rabindrasangeet. He was married to Dr. Purnima Sinha, a physicist, author and music scholar, who was the daughter of the eminent legal scholar and Bengali novelist, Dr. Nares Chandra Sen-Gupta.
Susang was a "zamindari" which traces its origins to the reign of Emperor Jahangir. In the British period, it was ranked third in protocol in the Government House of Calcutta after Coochbehar, a princely state and Burdwan, the premier zamindari of Bengal. The Maharajas of Susang, a hill estate, were the most influential "zamindars" of Mymensingh. The other major "zamindari" family of the same district were the Maharajas of Muktagacha, who in spite of being the richest "zamindars" in the district, considered the Susanga Maharajas to be their chiefs. The Maharaja of Susanga was the chief of all the other "zamindars" of Mymensingh, which emerged from the Muktagacha family, the predecessor estate.
A close paternal uncle, Maharajkumar Mani Singh was a well-known communist leader and the author of "Jiban Sangram". Moni Singh was an elected head of the CP in East Pakistan. In his youth Sinha followed in the footsteps of this paternal uncle. Sinha's maternal uncle was Kumar Jyotirindra Moitra, an eminent exponent of Rabindrasangeet, who was a son of thezamindar of Sithlai. Moitra, who was popularly called Botukda, was a lifelong member of the CPI and wrote the school song for Patha Bhavan, a school founded in Calcutta in the 1960s.
Even though Sinha was brought up and worked in Calcutta for most part of his life, he spent several years, especially the last few years in Santiniketan, where his parents owned a house from the beginning of the twentieth century. The Sinhas of Susanga can be considered to be one of the founding families of Santiniketan.
Education.
After his early education in a high school in Mymensingh, and then at Ballygunge Government High School, Calcutta, he started his college education in physics at Presidency College, Calcutta, but later shifted to geology and then to anthropology. Nirmal Kumar Bose, the eminent anthropologist, became his mentor soon after Bose and Sinha met in the viva examination for the masters degree, where Bose was one of the examiners. Later, Sinha completed his PhD in anthropology from Northwestern University, United States on a Fulbright Scholarship.
Career.
In his long and illustrious career he held the post of professor, Indian Institute of Management Calcutta for a long time.
He also held a number of administrative posts such as director of the Anthropological Survey of India in Calcutta. At this time he was considered to be an advisor of the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. He was the upacharya of Visva Bharati in Santiniketan. After retirement he became the second director of the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta.
Sinha distinguished himself in the field of social anthropology. Upon returning to India from the United States, he continued to conduct field research. His main area of research was Indian tribes, particularly the Bhumij tribe in central India.
Opinion.
Sinha was committed to the ideologies of both Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore, arguably the two most eminent Indians in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The difference between the views of these two men was that whereas Gandhi wanted every Indian to be (in the best sense) a Shudra, Tagore wanted every Indian to be (also in the best sense) a Brahmin.
Legacy.
He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1993 and died after a prolonged illness in 2002. He left behind a rich heritage of anthropological fields of research. He inspired a whole generation of Indian anthropologists and contributed significantly to understanding the process of acculturation of tribal people in India.

Morning in the Streets

Morning in the Streets is a BBC television documentary directed by Denis Mitchell and Roy Harris in 1959, for the BBC Northern Film Unit. It was broadcast on 25 March 1959.
The documentary was described simply as "an impression of life and opinion in the back streets of a northern city in the morning". 
It is an impressionistic slice-of-life documentary, featuring footage of working-class people and street scenes, accompanied by a montage soundtrack of voices conveying opinions and philosophies on life. The film was researched by a well-known writer on Liverpool life and dialect Frank Shaw. It is one of the few televisual documents to reflect the post-war austerity felt by areas such as Liverpool in the 1950s, puncturing the myth of post-war cross-class affluence.
The music was specially composed by Thomas Henderson and Liverpool songwriter Stan Kelly, and featured the harmonica of classical musician Tommy Reilly.
"The Talking Streets".
"The Talking Streets" was a radio feature produced by Denis Mitchell for the BBC North Region, as part of his "People Talking" series, and broadcast on 27 October 1958. The programme was a kaleidoscope of voices, sounds and stories recorded by Mitchell using a portable tape recorder. These recordings provided the inspiration and the basis of the soundtrack for "Morning in the Streets".
Recent revivals.
It was shown on BBC Four in 2008 as part of the "Liverpool on the Box" season to coincide with the city being European Capital of Culture, and again in September 2010. It was then further repeated in July 2011 on BBC Four as part of the "Britain through a Lens" season.

KevJumba

Kevin Wu () (born June 12, 1990) is a Chinese American and Taiwanese American comedian and YouTube celebrity who is best known by his YouTube username of KevJumba. He is currently on an indefinite leave from the University of California, Davis, where he majored in film, and from YTF Legacy. The "San Francisco Chronicle"'s Jeff Yang has noted that Wu is not a comedian in the conventional sense but that by "just talking is, well, pretty hilarious" due to his deadpan vocal delivery, animated facial expressions and tendency toward unexpected digressions. Wu previously appeared on The CW Television Network's short-lived "Online Nation" and co-starred with Jessica Lee Rose and Philip DeFranco in "Hooking Up" from HBOLabs (the online arm of HBO) in 2008. In 2010, Wu and his father, Michael, competed as a team on the 17th season of "The Amazing Race", placing seventh out of eleven teams.
Background.
Kevin Wu was born on June 12, 1990 in Houston, Texas. His father, Michael Wu, a Taiwanese immigrant, is a computer engineer. Wu graduated from Clements High School in Sugar Land, Texas, in 2008 and attended the University of California at Davis, before dropping out. He currently lives in downtown Los Angeles.
Kevin's YouTube videos.
Wu is known for posting humorous videos on YouTube. When Wu's "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" video was featured on YouTube's home page, his number of viewers began to increase. In this video, Wu talks about stereotypes he has to deal with as an Asian. He tries to disprove his cheapness by bragging about the recent purchase of a "brand new, top-of-the-line, TI-84 calculator". He acknowledges that this might make him nerdy but dismisses this stereotype too as he does not "make all A's...in school today made a B+." He is then greeted by a voice that was supposed to be his mother calling him a loser and accusing him of dishonoring their family. Wu goes on to say he can prove his predominant social life with the constant ringing of his cell phone. At this point, his phone indeed rings, he answers it, and the voice on the other end to Wu's disappointment says, "Hey, why did you tell me to call you?" Wu has collaborated with fellow YouTube comedian Christine Gambito (HappySlip), making five videos with her. In one of Kevin's older videos, he said he was an only child, which was later proven wrong by his father.
Following his video, "Butthash Hero", Wu introduced his father, PapaJumba, onto his YouTube channel, and his father made several appearances in candid video clips taken by his son. Responding to Wu's father's growing popularity among viewers, his father made a debut in "I Love My Dad", and has been featured alongside his son many times since. 
As of October 2013, Wu had more than 3,000,000 subscribers and more than 25 million views of his channel. His combined video views total over 343.9 million. On February 26, 2008, the "Los Angeles Times" compared the web series Quarterlife's viewership to Wu's. At the time Wu was a "semi-well known YouTube blogger" and had received 450,000 views for a video describing how he broke his shin. Quarterlife, which had been picked up by NBC, had received only 100,000 views on MySpace and 50,000 views on YouTube.
By May 29, 2008, Wu had become one of three East Asians under the age of 21 to be in the top five of YouTube's all-time most subscribed users with 187,000 subscribers and more than 5.9 million views. By June 5, 2008, he had become the number one subscribed comedian on YouTube, and third most subscribed uploader overall. Wu's videos have received replies from Ella Koon, Jessica Alba, and Baron Davis. In 2008, Davis created a "longest stare" contest for ibeatyou.com, a site that he and Alba's husband Cash Warren co-founded. The contest began with Davis challenging Wu, who then challenged Alba, who responded to the challenge.
"Funemployed".
The web series "Funemployed", launched in the summer of 2010, stars Wu and Philip Wang of Wong Fu Productions and includes other notable YouTube stars such as Nigahiga, David Choi, Kina Grannis, and Chester See. With the large number of fans, this series quickly took off and became a hit, reaching 500,000 viewers in only a few weeks. The series focuses on two good friends named Kyle (Wu) and Jason (Philip Wang), and how they are dealing with unemployment after Jason is laid off at work. Kyle is characterized as the typical laid back guy, who comes off as somewhat of a slacker, while Jason is characterized as the more studious hard worker of the two. The two eventually come up with an idea of how to make money, believing that YouTube is the key, an allusion to Wu's and Wang's real life success with YouTube videos. "Funemployed" eventually came to an end on July 27, 2010, with their last episode entitled, "Gave it a Shot". There were a total of eleven episodes and 30 sitcoms.
Other work.
In 2007, Wu appeared on the The CW Television Network's short-lived "Online Nation". "Online Nation" compiled an hour of web clips, broadcast them during primetime, lasting four episodes. Wu, along with other popular YouTube personalities, is also paid to broadcast a streaming show on BlogTV. He has been a member of BlogTV since March 29, 2008, and as of November 2, 2008, he had produced 70 live and 23 recorded shows with over 300,000 viewers of the live show and 100,000 viewers of the recorded shows.
As of October 2008, Wu starred with Jessica Rose and Phillip DeFranco in "Hooking Up" from HBOLabs (the online arm of HBO), a scripted 10-episode web-based series. "Hooking Up" is set at a fictional university where the students spend most of their time emailing and twittering, but still manage to miscommunicate. It is his first work on a scripted production. Guest appearances on "Hooking Up" will be made by Kevin Nalty, Michael Buckley, and other internet celebrities. The entire cast of "Hooking Up" is composed of YouTube video bloggers in the hope of attracting a young, internet knowledgeable audience. By the show's second day on YouTube, it had received more than 450,000 views. According to NewTeeVee.com, an evolving consensus is that for an online video to be a hit, somewhere between 100,000 and one million views are needed, giving "Hooking Up" a strong start. Maria Russo of the "Los Angeles Times" felt that Wu was better looking than star DeFranco and wondered why Wu plays the "tired role of the East Asian friend who helps the white guy get the chicks," while Bobbie Johnson of "The Guardian" said that many web surfers had "scoffed at what they see as a cynical attempt to cash in." On October 2, 2011, Wu hosted "Flicks" on Cartoon Network during an airing of "Around the World in 80 Days". Wu has also announced he will be starring in the independent film "Rock Jocks" with Justin Chon, Felicia Day, and Gerry Bedknob, which will be released in 2012.
In 2011, Wu began performing with Yesterday, Today, Forever (YTF) along with other YouTube personalities. The group performed their first concert on October 9, 2011 in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Wu also has another YouTube account going by the username JumbaFund, which donated all of its earnings to a charity that viewers suggested. Wu donated over 5,000 dollars to a charity in Kenya, which later built a school after him, to build a new school in a span of 5 months from all of the profits he made through JumbaFund. He recently cited that he would now donate all earnings from this point on to Kenya in order to help finish and pay off the costs of the new secondary school being built there. Wu mentions this in his video and always records himself donating all the profits to the charity in order to show the viewers that his JumbaFund charity is not used for anything but to donate to the needy.
On his JumbaFund videos, Wu went to Lenana in Kenya to meet with kids in a campaign by The Supply. In 2011, a school in Kenya was built called the "Jumba Lenana Academy".
In 2011, Wu was a "sponsor" of Brian Wong of the K&N Pro Series West, who raced a car with Wu's paint scheme in the Casino Arizona 125 at Phoenix International Raceway.
In June 2012, Wu began starring in YouTube videos on a new channel called YOMYOMF. He stars in his own series called, "Kevjumba Takes All".
"The Amazing Race".
In May and June 2010, Wu participated with his father in filming for the 17th season of "The Amazing Race", an American reality television game show. Upon this announcement, it was also the first time his dad's name, Michael, was revealed, which was kept anonymous since his debut. Wu officially announced his participation on Facebook on September 1, and on YouTube a week later. The season premiered on September 26, 2010. Michael and Kevin's best placement was a third place finish in Leg 2 and Leg 6. Their worst placement was a last place finish (9th) in Leg 3, a non-elimination leg. They ended up in seventh place and were eliminated in Leg 7 after being issued two 30-minute penalties for using a cab to travel between tasks on the leg when they were instructed to walk; another team had also issued a similar penalty and checked in after them, but only had one half-hour penalty, resulting in Kevin and Michael's elimination.
Cartoon Network.
Wu is currently appearing in the pre-commercials on Cartoon Network's Flicks. He is the second internet sensation to appear in Cartoon Network, with the other being Annoying Orange. Fred Figglehorn and Ryan Higa have appeared on one of CN's rival channels, Nickelodeon.
"Hang Loose".
In December 2012 Wu released "Hang Loose", his first full length feature film. Wu began working on the film in late 2011 with Dante Basco and Kinetic Films LLC. 
"Hang Loose" is a comedy in which Wu, who stars as himself, goes to Hawaii for his sister's wedding, but finds himself on a misadventure with his future brother-in-law (played by Dante Basco) that changes his life. Other notable actors in the film include Justin Chon as the main antagonist, BJ. Wu's father also makes a guest appearance. The film is currently being marketed through Wu's official blog.

Apple

The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree, species Malus domestica in the rose family (Rosaceae). It is one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits, and the most widely known of the many members of genus "Malus" that are used by humans. Apples grow on small, deciduous trees. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, "Malus sieversii", is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have been present in the mythology and religions of many cultures, including Norse, Greek and Christian traditions. In 2010, the fruit's genome was decoded as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, fresh eating and cider production. Domestic apples are generally propagated by grafting, although wild apples grow readily from seed. Trees are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means.
About 69 million tons of apples were grown worldwide in 2010, and China produced almost half of this total. The United States is the second-leading producer, with more than 6% of world production. Turkey is third, followed by Italy, India and Poland. Apples are often eaten raw, but can also be found in many prepared foods (especially desserts) and drinks. Many beneficial health effects are thought to result from eating apples; however, two forms of allergies are seen to various proteins found in the fruit.
Botanical information.
The apple forms a tree that is small and deciduous, generally standing tall in cultivation and up to in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density is determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides. 
Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves, and are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first, and can develop a larger fruit. 
The fruit matures in autumn, and varieties exist with a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green or pink, although many bi- or tri-colored varieties may be found. The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax, The flesh is generally pale yellowish-white, though pink or yellow flesh is also known.
Wild ancestors.
The original wild ancestor of "Malus domestica" was "Malus sieversii", found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with "Malus sylvestris", the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples to be more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor "Malus sieversii". In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.
Genome.
In 2010, an Italian-led consortium announced they had decoded the complete genome of the apple in collaboration with horticultural genomicists at Washington State University, using the Golden delicious variety. It had about 57,000 genes, the highest number of any plant genome studied to date and more genes than the human genome (about 30,000). This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. Decoding the genome also provided proof that "Malus sieversii" was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.
History.
The center of diversity of the genus "Malus" is in eastern Turkey. The apple tree was perhaps the earliest tree to be cultivated, and its fruits have been improved through selection over thousands of years. Alexander the Great is credited with finding dwarfed apples in Kazakhstan in Asia in 328 BCE; those he brought back to Macedonia might have been the progenitors of dwarfing root stocks. Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia. 
Apples were brought to North America by colonists in the 17th century, and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1625. The only apples native to North America are crab apples, which were once called "common apples". Apple varieties brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on Colonial farms. An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the "best" varieties, showing the proliferation of new North American varieties by the early 19th century. In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the multibillion dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product.
Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage. In the 21st century, long-term storage again came into popularity, as "controlled atmosphere" facilities were used to keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities use high humidity and low oxygen and carbon dioxide levels to maintain fruit freshness.
Cultural aspects.
Germanic paganism.
In Norse mythology, the goddess Iðunn is portrayed in the "Prose Edda" (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in "Skáldskaparmál") have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.
Davidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a tribe of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven "golden apples" being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by Skírnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of "Skírnismál". Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the "Völsunga saga" when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound. Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the Caesarean section birth of their son—the hero Völsung.
Further, Davidson points out the "strange" phrase "Apples of Hel" used in an 11th-century poem by the skald Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn "we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world."
Greek mythology.
Apples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that the word "apple" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century. For instance, in Greek mythology, the Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center.
The Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed Καλλίστη ("Kalliste", sometimes transliterated "Kallisti", 'For the most beautiful one'), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.
The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, to be sacred to Aphrodite, and to throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:
Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from "melon" the Greek word for both "apple" and fruit in general), who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.
The forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.
Though the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her. The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in confusion between the Latin words "mālum" (an apple) and "mălum" (an evil), each of which is normally written "malum". The tree of the forbidden fruit is called "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" in , and the Latin for "good and evil" is "bonum et malum". 
Renaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has been called Adam's apple because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam. The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.
Cultivars.
There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs, has a collection of over 2,000 accessions in Kent. The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group. 
The UK's national fruit collection database contains a wealth of information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same 'genetic' apple variety. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider. Cider apples are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.
Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desired qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor. Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following. Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia and especially India.
Old cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and have a variety of textures and colors. Some find them to have a better flavor than modern cultivars, but may have other problems which make them commercially unviable from low yield, disease susceptibility, or poor tolerance for storage or transport. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old cultivars such as 'Cox's Orange Pippin' and 'Egremont Russet' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.
Cultivation.
Breeding.
In the wild, apples grow readily from seeds. However, like most perennial fruits, apples are ordinarily propagated asexually by grafting. This is because seedling apples are an example of "extreme heterozygotes", in that rather than inheriting DNA from their parents to create a new apple with those characteristics, they are instead significantly different from their parents. Triploid varieties have an additional reproductive barrier in that 3 sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive. 
Because apples do not breed true when planted as seeds, grafting is generally used to produce new apple trees. The rootstock used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees (less than high at maturity), which bear fruit earlier in their life cycle than full size trees. Dwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BC, to the area of Persia and Asia Minor. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees to Aristotle's Lyceum. Dwarf rootstocks became common by the 15th century, and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world. The majority of the rootstocks used today to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s. The East Malling Research Station conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and today their rootstocks are given an "M" prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an "MM" prefix are Malling-series varieties later crossed with trees of the Northern Spy variety in Merton, England.
Most new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics. The words 'seedling', 'pippin', and 'kernel' in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form bud sports (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.
Since the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the University of Minnesota has introduced a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. Its most important contributions have included 'Haralson' (which is the most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), 'Wealthy', 'Honeygold', and 'Honeycrisp'.
Apples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes, where they provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year-round.
Pollination.
Apples are self-incompatible; they must cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the flowering each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators.
There are four to seven pollination groups in apples, depending on climate:
One cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close (A with A, or A with B, but not A with C or D).
Varieties are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average 30-day blossom period, with pollenizers selected from varieties within a 6-day overlap period.
Maturation and harvest.
Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars, if left unpruned, will grow very large, which allows them to bear much more fruit, but makes harvesting very difficult. Depending on the tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks will bear about of fruit per year.
Crops ripen at different times of the year according to the variety of apple. Varieties that yield their crop in the summer include Gala, Golden Supreme, McIntosh, Transparent, Primate, Sweet Bough, and Duchess; fall producers include Fuji, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Chenango, Gravenstein, Wealthy, McIntosh, Snow, and Blenheim; winter producers include Winesap, Granny Smith, King, Wagener, Swayzie, Greening, and Tolman Sweet.
Storage.
Commercially, apples can be stored for some months in controlled-atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.
For home storage, most varieties of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (i.e. below 5 °C). Some types, including the Granny Smith and Fuji, can be stored up to a year without significant degradation. 
Pests and diseases.
Apple trees are susceptible to a number of fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue an aggressive program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. A trend in orchard management is the use of organic methods. These ban the use of some pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.
A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant; three of the more common diseases/pests are mildew, aphids and apple scab.
Among the most serious disease problems are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and "Gymnosporangium" rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.
Production.
About 63 million tonnes of apples were grown worldwide in 2012, with China producing almost half of this total. The United States is the second-leading producer, with more than 6% of world production. The largest exporters of apples in 2009 were China, the U.S., Turkey, Poland, Italy, Iran, and India while the biggest importers in the same year were Russia, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands.
In the United States, more than 60% of all the apples sold commercially are grown in Washington. Imported apples from New Zealand and other more temperate areas are competing with U.S. production and increasing each year.
Most of Australia's apple production is for domestic consumption. Imports from New Zealand have been disallowed under quarantine regulations for fireblight since 1921.
Other countries with a significant production are Brazil, Argentina, Ukraine, Germany and South Africa.
Human consumption.
Apples are often eaten raw. The whole fruit including the skin is suitable for human consumption except for the seeds, which may affect some consumers. The core is often not eaten and is discarded. Varieties bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples.
Apples can be canned or juiced. They are milled or pressed to produce apple juice, which may be drunk unfiltered (called apple cider in North America), or filtered. The juice can be fermented to make cider (called hard cider in North America), ciderkin, and vinegar. Through distillation, various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as applejack, Calvados, and apfelwein. Apple seed oil
and pectin may also be produced.
Popular uses.
Apples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and they can also be dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. Puréed apples are generally known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.
Sliced apples turn brown with exposure to air due to the conversion of natural phenolic substances into melanin upon exposure to oxygen. Different cultivars vary in their propensity to brown after slicing and the genetically engineered Arctic Apples do not brown. Sliced fruit can be treated with acidulated water to prevent this effect.
Organic production.
Organic apples are commonly produced in the United States. Organic production is difficult in Europe, though a few orchards have done so with commercial success, using disease-resistant cultivars. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also helps prevent apple sun scalding.
Allergy.
One form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.
In other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction.
Breeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy.
Toxicity of seeds.
The seeds of apples contain small amounts of amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide compound known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds will cause no ill effects, but in extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. There is only one known case of fatal cyanide poisoning from apple seeds; in this case the individual chewed and swallowed one cup of seeds. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released.
Nutrition.
The proverb ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away"", addressing the health effects of the fruit, dates from 19th century Wales. Preliminary research suggests that apples may reduce the risk of colon cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer. Apple peels contain ursolic acid which, in rat studies, increases skeletal muscle and brown fat, and decreases white fat, obesity, glucose intolerance, and fatty liver disease. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a typical apple serving weighs 242 grams and contains 126 calories with significant dietary fiber and vitamin C content.
Apple peels are a source of various phytochemicals with unknown nutritional value and possible antioxidant activity in vitro. The predominant phenolic phytochemicals in apples are quercetin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B2.
Apple juice concentrate has been found in mice to increase the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Other studies have shown an "alleviation of oxidative damage and cognitive decline" in mice after the administration of apple juice. Fruit flies fed an apple extract lived 10% longer than other flies fed a normal diet.

Climate change in Texas

Over the next century, climate in Texas could experience additional changes. For example, based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the United Kingdom Hadley Centre’s climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100 temperatures in Texas could increase by about 3 °F (~1.7 °C) in spring (with a range of 1-6°F) and about 4 °F (~2.2 °C) in other seasons (with a range of 1-9°F). Precipitation is estimated to decrease by 5-30% in winter and increase by about 10% in the other seasons.
Increases in summer could be slightly larger (up to 30%) than in spring and fall. Other climate models may show different results. The amount of precipitation on extreme wet or snowy days in
winter is likely to decrease, and the amount of precipitation on extreme wet days in summer is likely to increase. The frequency of extreme hot days in summer would increase because of the
general warming trend. It is not clear how severe storms such as hurricanes would change.
Climate change impacts.
Higher temperatures and increased frequency of heat waves may increase the number of heat-related deaths and the incidence of heat-related illnesses. 
In Dallas, one study projects that by 2050 heat-related deaths during a typical summer could triple, from about 35 heat-related deaths per summer to over 100 (although increased air conditioning used during these periods may not have been accounted for). Winter-related deaths are expected to change very little. The elderly, particularly those living alone, are at greatest risk.
Air pollution also is made worse by increases in natural hydrocarbon emissions during warm and hot weather. If a warmed climate causes increased use of air conditioners, air pollutant emissions from power plants also will increase.
Coast.
The Texas coastline is over long. The coastline is composed of wind tidal flats, sandy marshes, salt marshes, and beaches. The Laguna Madre has over of wind
tidal flats that provide nesting areas or rookeries for sea birds. 
The sandy marsh shoreline provides critical habitat for shorebirds, wading birds, endangered brown pelicans, and other birds. 
About 75% of the ducks and geese found in the United States move through the Texas coastal wetlands. The salt marshes provide a home for oysters and clams, and serve as nursery grounds for young shrimp, crab, and fish. These marshes protect the shorelines from erosion and also act as a purification system by filtering out many pollutants added to the waters by human activities.
At Galveston, sea level already is rising by per century, and it is likely to rise another by 2100. Brown shrimp catch in the U.S. Gulf Coast could fall 25% with only a rise in sea level. Possible responses to sea level rise include building walls to hold back the sea, allowing the sea to advance and adapting to it, and raising the land. Each of these responses will be costly, either in out-of-pocket costs or in lost land and structures. For example, the cumulative cost of sand replenishment to protect the coast of Texas from a sea level rise by 2100 is estimated at $4.2-$12.8 billion
Water resources.
Several major river basins lie in part, or entirely, within Texas. Unless increased temperatures are coupled with a strong increase in rainfall, water could become more scarce. A warmer and drier climate would lead to greater evaporation, as much as a 35% decrease in streamflow, and less water for recharging groundwater aquifers. Increased rainfall could mitigate these effects, but also could contribute to localized flooding. Additionally, climate change could give rise to more frequent and intense rainfall, resulting in flash flooding.
Agriculture.
In Texas, agriculture is a $12.6 billion annual industry, two-thirds of which comes from livestock, especially cattle. About 25% of the crop acreage is irrigated. The major crops in the state are cotton, wheat, and sorghum. Climate change could reduce cotton and sorghum yields by 2-15% and wheat yields by 43-68%, leading to changes in acres farmed and production. For example, cotton yields could fall while production rises because of an increase in cotton acres farmed. Irrigated acreage could decline slightly because of decreased water availability.
Forests.
With changes in climate, the extent and density of forested areas in east Texas could change little or decline by 50-70%. Hotter, drier weather could increase wildfires and the susceptibility of pine forests to pine bark beetles and other pests, which would reduce forests and expand grasslands and arid shrublands. With increased rainfall, however, these effects could be less severe. In some areas, the types of trees dominating Texas forests would change; for example, longleaf and slash pine densities could increase in the deciduous forests of east Texas.
Ecosystems.
The vast area within Texas includes a great diversity of ecosystems, from forests to grasslands to semiarid shrublands to extensive coastal and inland wetlands. In Texas, climate change could weaken and stress trees, making them more susceptible to pine bark beetle outbreaks. Semi-arid grasslands and shrublands are very sensitive to changes in rainfall season and in the amount of rainfall, and could be affected adversely by warmer, drier conditions.
The Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge in central Texas provides nesting grounds for the golden-cheeked warbler and the black-capped vireo, two endangered songbirds. Warmer and drier conditions could reduce critical habitat in the refuge and further stress sensitive plant and animal populations. The coastal wetlands, which support important fisheries and provide 
vital wildlife habitat, are also vulnerable to climate change. For example, Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge, a coastal estuarine and coastal prairie habitat on the Gulf Coast,
provides winter habitat for 30,000-40,000 ducks and 40,000 snow geese. The refuge also contains about of native coastal bluestem prairie. Changes in rainfall and runoff from upland regions could adversely affect sensitive coastal systems, and sea level rise would accelerate loss of wetlands and estuaries, eliminating breeding and foraging habitat for commercial, game, and threatened and endangered species.
Greenhouse gases.
Texas emits more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other state. And if Texas were a country, it would be the seventh-largest carbon dioxide polluter in the world . Texas's high carbon dioxide output and large energy consumption is primarily a result of large coal-burning power plants and gas-guzzling vehicles.
Action to address climate change.
Clean cities.
Texas is the home of the Alamo Area, Central Texas, Dallas/Fort Worth, East Texas, Greater Houston Regional), and South East Texas Clean Cities Coalitions.
Biofuel vehicle.
The Adopt-A-School Bus Program, a cooperative partnership between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state agencies, local elected officials, and corporate sponsors, was established as a nonprofit grant program to aid local school districts replacing their aging, diesel school bus fleets with new clean fuel buses. In an effort to ensure the longevity of the new buses, a portion of all grant money awarded is earmarked for fleet infrastructure and maintenance.
Renewable energy.
Wind power in Texas.
Wind power in Texas consists of many wind farms with a total installed nameplate capacity of 7,907 megawatts (MW) from over 40 different projects, as at April 2009. Texas produces the most wind power of any U.S. state, followed by Iowa with 2,883 MW. Wind energy accounts for 3.3% of all the energy used in the state and is growing.
Biofuels.
Grants.
The Texas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP) provides grants for alternative fuel and advanced technology demonstration and infrastructure projects under the New Technology Research and Development (NTRD) Program, which provides incentives to encourage and support research, development, and commercialization of technologies that reduce pollution in Texas. For complete information on the types of projects and expenses that may be eligible for a grant, refer to the latest Request for Grant Applications and the NTRD Guidelines. The NTRD Program is administered by the Texas Environmental Research Consortium, with support from the Houston Advanced Research Center.
The Texas State Energy Conservation Office researches and assists public and private entities in securing grants to encourage the use of alternative fuels, including conversion of state and local government fleets to operate on compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, biodiesel, and bioethanol, and the use of hybrid electric vehicles.
Production fee.
Ethanol and biodiesel producers are subject to a fee of $0.032 per gallon of ethanol or biodiesel produced in each registered production facility, imposed by the Texas Department of Agriculture. 
For the purpose of the state regulation, ethanol is defined as ethyl alcohol that is at least 99% pure ethanol by volume that meets American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) specification D4806. Biodiesel is a monoalkyl ester derived from vegetable oils, rendered animal fats, or renewable lipids or a combination of those ingredients, and meets the requirements of ASTM PS 121, the provisional specification for biodiesel.

Ōno's lexical law

Ōno's lexical law, or simply Ōno's law, is a statistical law for the rate word classes as they appear in the lexicon of classical Japanese literary works. The law was discovered by Japanese linguist Susumu Ōno and published in 1956.
Summary.
The law states that, for the nine literary works under consideration (one work is in two editions, hence ten manuscripts total), the percentage of words in each of the four given word classes vary simultaneously linearly, between the most noun-heavy Man'yōshū and the most verb-heavy Tale of Genji. The four word classes are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adjectival nouns, with nouns and verbs being the bulk of the words. If there were only two word classes, this statement would be trivial: as one word class (say, nouns) decreases, the other (say, verbs) increases by exactly the corresponding amount. However, what the law observes is that as use of nouns decreases, use of verbs "and" adjectives and adjectival nouns increases, and that these increase by approximately constant proportions (hence linear).
The horizontal axis (in Ōno's formulation) is arbitrary, and should not be interpreted as time. The graph in the re-formulation by Mizutani is more easily interpreted, and shows a scatter plot of nouns versus other word classes.
Ōno's lexical law (Original version).
Obtain the rates of usage for four word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adjectival noun for "Man'yōshū" and "Genji Monogatari". Plot the rates of the four word classes for the "Man'yōshū" on the y-axis. Then plot the rates for "Genji Monogatari" on a vertical line to the right. Connecting the two points for the noun revealed a monotonically decreasing line, Connecting the two points for any of other word classes all resulted in a monotonically increasing line. Plot an additional point corresponding to any of other seven classic literatures on each line of the word classes. Then it revealed that any of those new point sets for one of the additional literatures on different lines of word classes was located approximately on a different vertical line.
Revised Ōno's lexical law by Mizutani.
Let the rates of noun usage in the lexicon of 3 arbitrary literary works A, B, and C be 
formula_1, respectively. With rates formula_2 for usage of another word class of the same 3 literatures, respectively, then 3 points, formula_3 will approximately be located on a line. Namely,

Birth control

Birth control, also known as contraception and fertility control, are methods or devices used to prevent pregnancy. Planning, provision and use of birth control is called family planning. Safe sex, such as the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Birth control methods have been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods only became available in the 20th century. Some cultures deliberately limit access to birth control because they consider it to be morally or politically undesirable.
The most effective methods of birth control are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implantable contraceptives. --> This is followed by a number of hormonal contraceptives including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. --> Less effective methods include barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and contraceptive sponge and fertility awareness methods. --> The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. --> Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Emergency contraceptives can prevent pregnancy in the few days after unprotected sex. Some regard sexual abstinence as birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teen pregnancies when offered without contraceptive education.
In teenagers, pregnancies are at greater risk of poor outcomes. --> Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control may be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are of particular benefit in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks.--> Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months.--> In those who are breast feeding progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral contraceptives.--> In those who have reached menopause it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.
About 222 million women who want to avoid pregnancy in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less consumption of scarce resources.
Methods.
Birth control methods include barrier methods, hormonal birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective for up to a few days after sex. Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal ligation.
The most effective methods are those that are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits. Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%. Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if used strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. With typical use first-year failure rates are considerably high, at 9%, due to incorrect usage. Other methods such as fertility awareness, condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage.
While all methods of birth control have some potential adverse effects, the risk is less than that of pregnancy. After stopping or removing many methods of birth control, including oral contraceptives, IUDs, implants and injections, the rate of pregnancy during the subsequent year is the same as for those who used no birth control.
In those with specific health problems, certain forms of birth control may require further investigations. For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam including birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms. Specifically, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills do not appear to affect outcomes and therefore are not required. The World Health Organization in 2009 published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control.
Hormonal.
Hormonal contraceptives work by inhibiting ovulation and fertilization. They are available in a number of different forms including oral pills, implants under the skin, injections, patches, IUDs and a vaginal ring. They are currently available only for women. There are two types of oral birth control, the combined oral contraceptive pill and the progestogen-only pill. If taken during pregnancy, they neither increase the risk of miscarriage nor cause birth defects.
Combined hormonal contraceptives are associated with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots. Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy. Due to this risk, they are not recommended in women over 35 years of age who continue to smoke. The effect on sexual desire is varied, with increase or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen found in the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.
Progestin-only pills, injections and intrauterine devices are not associated with an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins. In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used. Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. --> Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods. The progestins, drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line. The perfect use first-year failure rate of the injectable progestin, Depo-Provera, is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.
Barrier.
Barrier contraceptives are devices that attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the uterus. They include male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges with spermicide.
Globally, condoms are the most common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and physically block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.
Male condoms and the diaphragm with spermicide have typical use first-year failure rates of 18% and 12%, respectively. With perfect use condoms are more effective with a 2% first-year failure rate versus a 6% first-year rate with the diaphragm. Condoms have the additional benefit of helping to prevent the spread of some sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS.
Contraceptive sponges combine a barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are inserted vaginally before intercourse and must be placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates during the first year depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24 hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.
Intrauterine devices.
The current intrauterine devices (IUD) are small devices, often 'T'-shaped, often containing either copper or levonorgestrel, which are inserted into the uterus. They are one form of long-acting reversible contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth control. Failure rates with the copper IUD is about 0.8% while the levonorgestrel IUD has a failure rates of 0.2% in the first year of use. Among types of birth control, they along with birth control implants result in the greatest satisfaction among users. As of 2007, IUDs are the most widely used form of reversible contraception, with more than 180 million users worldwide.
Evidence supports effectiveness and safety in adolescents and those who have and have not previously had children. IUDs do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery. They may also be used immediately after an abortion. Once removed, even after long term use, fertility returns to normal immediately.
While copper IUDs may increase menstrual bleeding and result in more painful cramps hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether. Cramping can be treated with NSAIDs. Other potential complications include expulsion (2–5%) and rarely perforation of the uterus (less than 0.7%). A previous model of the intrauterine device (the Dalkon shield) was associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion.
Sterilization.
Surgical sterilization is available in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two. With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.
This decision may cause regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, as compared with 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated they would not have had children if they were able to do it over again.
Although sterilization is considered a permanent procedure, it is possible to attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88%, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6%. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84%; with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal. Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.
Behavioral.
Behavioral methods involve regulating the timing or method of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract, either altogether or when an egg may be present. If used perfectly the first-year failure rate may be around 3.4%, however if used poorly first-year failure rates may approach 85%.
Fertility awareness.
Fertility awareness methods involve determining the most fertile days of the menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse. Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature, cervical secretions, or the day of the cycle. They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%. The evidence on which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early. Globally, they are used by about 3.6% of couples. If based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. Overall first-year failure rates of <2% to 20% have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method.
Withdrawal.
The withdrawal method (also known as coitus interruptus) is the practice of ending sexual intercourse ("pulling out") before ejaculation. The main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner. First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage. It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.
There is little evidence regarding the sperm content of pre-ejaculatory fluid. While some tentative research did not find sperm, one trial found sperm present in 10 out of 27 volunteers. The withdrawal method is used as birth control by about 3% of couples.
Abstinence.
Though some groups advocate total sexual abstinence, by which they mean the avoidance of all sexual activity, in the context of birth control the term usually means abstinence from vaginal intercourse. Abstinence is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy; however, not everyone who intends to be abstinent refrains from all sexual activity, and in many populations there is a significant risk of pregnancy from nonconsensual sex.
</ref>
Abstinence-only sex education does not reduce teen pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, as compared with comprehensive sex education. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex and other forms of penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.
Lactation.
The lactational amenorrhea method involves the use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.
Emergency.
Emergency contraceptive methods are medications (sometimes misleadingly referred to as "morning-after pills") or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse with the hope of preventing pregnancy. They work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization. A number of options exist, including high dose birth control pills, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, ulipristal and IUDs. Levonorgestrel pills, when used within 3 days, decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70% (resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2%). Ulipristal, when used within 5 days, decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85% (pregnancy rate 1.4%) and might be a little more effective than levonorgestrel. Mifepristone is also more effective than levonorgestrel while copper IUDs are the most effective method. IUDs can be inserted up to five days after intercourse and prevent about 99% of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex (pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2%). This makes them the most effective form of emergency contraceptive. In those who are overweight or obese levonorgestrel is less effective and an IUD or ulipristal is recommended.
Providing emergency contraceptive pills to women in advance does not affect rates of sexually transmitted infections, condom use, pregnancy rates, or sexual risk-taking behavior. All methods have minimal side effects.
Dual protection.
Dual protection is the use of methods that prevent both sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. This can be with condoms either alone or along with another birth control method or by the avoidance of penetrative sex.
If pregnancy is a high concern using two methods at the same time is reasonable, and two forms of birth control is recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin, due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy.
Effects.
Health.
Contraceptive use in developing countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met. These benefits are achieved by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.
Birth control also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies. In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery. Delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.
Teenage pregnancies, especially among younger teens, are at greater risk of adverse outcomes including early birth, low birth weight, and death of the infant. In the United States 82% of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 are unplanned. Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group.

]]
In the developing world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children and thus more women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control is one of the most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.
The total medical cost for a pregnancy, delivery and care of a newborn in the United States is on average $21,000 for a vaginal delivery and $31,000 for a Caesarean section as of 2012. In most other countries the cost is less than half. For a child born in 2011, an average US family will spend $235,000 over 17 years to raise them.
Prevalence.
Globally, as of 2009, approximately 60% of those who are married and able to have children use birth control. How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries. The most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives, while in Africa it is oral contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization. In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.
While less used in the developed countries than the developing world, the number of women using IUDs as of 2007 was more than 180 million. Avoiding sex when fertile is used by about 3.6% of women of childbearing age, with usage as high as 20% in areas of South America. As of 2005, 12% of couples are using a male form of birth control (either condoms or a vasectomy) with higher rates in the developed world. Usage of male forms of birth control has decreased between 1985 and 2009. Contraceptive use among women in Sub-Saharan Africa has risen from about 5% in 1991 to about 30% in 2006.
As of 2012, 57% of women of childbearing age want to avoid pregnancy (867 of 1520 million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53 million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97 million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54 million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.
History.
Early history.
The Egyptian Ebers Papyrus from 1550 BCE and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850 BCE have within them some of the earliest documented descriptions of birth control: the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm. It is believed that in Ancient Greece silphium was used as birth control which, due to its effectiveness and thus desirability, was harvested into extinction.
In medieval Europe, any effort to halt pregnancy was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church, although it is believed that women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina (and, in addition, infanticide after birth). Casanova, living in 18th century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.
Birth control movement.
The birth control movement developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Malthusian League, based on the ideas of Thomas Malthus, was established in 1877 to education the public about the importance of family planning and to advocate for getting rid of penalties for promoting birth control. It was founded during the "Knowlton trial" of Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh, who were prosecuted for publishing on various methods of birth control.
In the United States, Margaret Sanger and Otto Bobsein popularized the phrase "birth control" in 1914. Sanger was mainly active in the United States but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s. Sanger established a short-lived birth-control clinic in 1916, which was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest. The publicity surrounding the arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States.
The first permanent birth-control clinic was established in Britain in 1921 by Marie Stopes working with the Malthusian League. The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors, offered mothers birth-control advice and taught them the use of a cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, played a major role in breaking down taboos about sex. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere - three months later, the Ministry of Health, in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centers.
Modern methods.
In 1909, Richard Richter developed the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg in the late 1920s. Gregory Pincus and John Rock with help from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America developed the first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/norethynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s. Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.
Society and culture.
Legal positions.
Human rights agreements require most governments to provide family planning and contraceptive information and services. --> These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that a wide variety of safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented. --> If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.
In 2010, the United Nations launched the "Every Woman Every Child" movement to assess the progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs. --> The initiative has set a goal of increasing the number of users of modern birth control by 120 million women in the world's 69 poorest countries by the year 2020. --> Additionally, they aim to eradicate discrimination against girls and young women who seek contraceptives.
Religious views.
Religions vary widely in their views of the ethics of birth control. The Roman Catholic Church officially only accepts natural family planning in certain cases, although large numbers of Catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods of birth control. Among Protestants there is a wide range of views from supporting none to allowing all methods of birth control. Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use both natural and artificial contraceptives. A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not.
In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some. The Quran does not make any explicit statements about the morality of birth control, but contains statements encouraging having children. Prophet Muhammad also is reported to have said "marry and procreate".
World Contraception Day.
The 26th of September is World Contraception Day, devoted to raising awareness and improving education about sexual and reproductive health, with a vision of "a world where every pregnancy is wanted." It is supported by a group of governments and international NGOs, including the Asian Pacific Council on Contraception, Centro Latinamericano Salud y Mujer, the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health, the German Foundation for World Population, the International Federation of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Marie Stopes International, Population Services International, the Population Council, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Women Deliver.
Misconceptions.
There are a number of common misconceptions regarding sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended. Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.
Research directions.
Females.
Improvements of existing birth control methods are needed, as around half of those who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations of existing contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective for three or four months and is currently available in some areas of the world.
A number of methods to perform sterilization via the cervix are being studied. --> One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. --> While the procedure is inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects. Another substance, polidocanol, which functions in the same manner is being looked at. A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.
Males.
Methods of male birth control include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal. Between 25 and 75% of males who are sexually active would use hormonal birth control if it was available for them. A number of hormonal and non-hormonal methods are in trials, and there is some research looking at the possibility of contraceptive vaccines.
A reversible surgical method under investigation is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) which consists of injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. --> An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. --> Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. --> A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.
Other animals.
Neutering or spaying, which involves removing some of the reproductive organs, is often carried out as a method of birth control in household pets. Many animal shelters require these procedures as part of adoption agreements. In large animals the surgery is known as castration. Birth control is also being considered as an alternative to hunting as a means of controlling overpopulation in wild animals. Contraceptive vaccines have been found to be effective in a number of different animal populations.

Diocese of Città della Pieve

The former Italian Catholic Diocese of Città della Pieve, in Umbria, existed until 1986. In that year it was united into the Archdiocese of Perugia-Città della Pieve.
History.
Città della Pieve is a city of obscure origin in the province of Perugia. It certainly was an episcopal see in the eleventh century, since in 1099 the bishop was expelled by the Ghibellines. Later Pope Paschal II united it with the Diocese of Chiusi.
Pope Clement VIII re-established it as a separate see, immediately subject to the Holy See, in 1601, the first bishop being Fabrizio Paolucci of the Counts of Cabulo. In 1642, while Giovanni Battista Carcarasio was bishop, the city was sacked by the German soldiers of the Duke of Parma.
The cathedral, dedicated to Sts. Gervasius and Protasius, is said to have been erected at the exhortation of St. Ambrose.

Holden FE

The Holden FE is an automobile which was produced by General Motors–Holden's in Australia from 1956 to 1958. It was also the first Holden to be assembled in New Zealand, where GMNZ built their first one on 31 January 1957.
Changes.
The FE models were built on a longer wheelbase than the FJ series Holdens which they replaced and they featured totally different styling, the FJ models having used a body shape carried over from the original Holden 48-215 series introduced in 1948. A single piece windscreen was now fitted and other improvements included a 12 volt electrical system (replacing the previous 6 volt system), improved steering, a front stabiliser bar and wider wheel rims. All models used a 2262 cc in-line six cylinder engine, coupled with a 3 speed manual gearbox. Engine improvements over the FJ included the use of bigger valves and the lifting of the compression ratio to 6.8:1, which increased the power output from 45 kW (60 hp) to 53 kW (71 hp).
Model range.
The seven Holden FE models series were marketed as follows:
When introduced in July 1956, the FE range consisted of the Holden Standard Sedan, Holden Business Sedan and Holden Special Sedan, the names designating different levels of equipment and interior trim. The existing FJ series Holden Utility and Holden Panel Van models continued alongside the new sedans, with the FE Utility replacing its FJ counterpart in February 1957. Two station wagon models, the Holden Standard Station Sedan and the Holden Special Station Sedan were released in March 1957, marking the first time that Holden had included a wagon in its range since the marque was introduced in 1948. The FE Panel Van replaced its FJ predecessor in May 1957, bringing the FE range up to its full complement of seven models.
The FE was also the first Holden to be assembled locally in New Zealand, in 1957 and 1958.
Production & replacement.
After a production run of 155,161 vehicles the entire FE range was replaced by the Holden FC series in July 1958.

Sean McGuire

Sean McGuire (December 26, 1927 – March 24, 2005) was a former All Ireland Fiddle Champion. He was from Belfast.
Biography.
McGuire was only fourteen when his violin playing was broadcast for the first time on BBC radio. In 1949 at the age of only twenty-one, he won the Oireachtas (pronounced "err-OCTH-us"), the All-Ireland musical championship held annually in Dublin) with the only perfect score ever awarded in the long history of the competition. In the 1950s, he became part of a major touring group called the Malachy Sweeney Ceili Band; later he helped form the Sean McGuire Ceili Band and the Four Star Quartet. Through the 1960s he was a leading member of the Gael-Linn Cabaret.
In the days before the Chieftains assumed the role, McGuire sometimes served as Irish musics cultural ambassador. He has appeared throughout Europe, and he has been named "Grande Artiste" of the Soviet Union. When he toured the U.S. in 1952, he was asked to appear on such classic American variety programs as The Ed Sullivan Show and the Arthur Godfrey Show. He was also honored by the Wurlitzer Co. of New York City, who not only invited him to play the Stradivarius and Guarnerius violins in their possession, but also to enter his name (alongside those of Fritz Kreisler and Yehudi Menuhin) in their "golden book" of master violinists.
Over the years, McGuire's name has become synonymous in Irish traditional fiddling with excellent musicianship. He has composed many pieces for the idiom, and written countless classic variations ; not only for the aforementioned "Masons Apron" ; but also for such common tunes as "The Poppy Leaf," "The Bees Wing," "The Reconciliation," "The Boys of the Lough," and "The Golden Eagle." Among his many innovations to the playing of traditional Irish music have been the practice of using sophisticated key modulations (changes) within a piece, the adaptation of advanced classical bowing techniques, and the use of up-the-neck violin "positions."
In terms of training, ambitions, and outlook, McGuire is certainly comparable to a major figure in Scottish fiddling history named James Scott Skinner (1843–1927). Skinner, too, sought to widen the scope of his native fiddling and increase its regard internationally. He created important sets of variations, and incorporated up-the- neck positions and sophisticated bowing techniques into traditional music. He was celebrated in his own time, and to this day his variations are reproduced note for note by traditional musicians in both Scotland and Cape Breton.
Because McGuire lived in a different era and worked in a different tradition than Skinner, he has for the most part been a much more controversial figure. Even before Skinner came along, Scottish fiddling had a long tradition of virtuosi who were equally at home in both the art and folk traditions. Moreover, the long history of Scottish tune-publication created a respect both for the written note and for those artists who approached the music from a learned perspective.
Irish music before the time of McGuire, on the other hand, was still pretty much an oral music culture. As we shall see, there was even a strong feeling among some that a musician with McGuires training and outlook could not possibly perform Irelands traditional music in an authentic manner. Certainly, there was a lot of resistance among musicians of "the old school" to some of McGuire's innovations. One story along these lines was imparted to me by piper/tin whistler Bill Ochs of New York City. When McGuire landed at a house party in Philadelphia some years ago at which traditional fiddler John Vesey was already holding court, the latter is said to have stood up and remarked, "There will be no playing in the flat keys in this house tonight!"
Listen to an original recording of Irish fiddle master Sean McGuire (Maguire) playing some tunes in his own original style. He was regarded as one of the finest musicians of his day. Maguire's great drive and tone were thought to be due to the ease with which he was able to make his classical violin education and keen ear for Irish music work so well together. Like many of his generation he believed that the music encouraged a more contented life. His God-given gift for music helped interest in Irish culture spread throughout the world. The lively spirit of the natural way he played as a young man would do you good to hear..

M'Liss (1918 film)

"M'Liss" is a 1918 silent film directed by Marshall Neilan, written by Frances Marion and based on a Bret Harte's story. The film was made previously in 1915 and was remade again in 1922 as "The Girl Who Ran Wild", starring Gladys Walton. Another same-titled remake was released in 1936, starring Anne Shirley.
Plot.
The film takes place in the mining town of Red Gulch in the High Sierra. M'Liss (Mary Pickford) is one of the inhabitants whose father 'Bummer' (Theodore Roberts) lost his fortune in the gold mines. Now his only investment, which pays a dividend, is his chicken Hildegarde. M'Liss regards herself as a crook and robs Yuba Bill's stage coach. Yuba, however, is fascinated by the young lady and doesn't mind.
M'Liss is the only person in 'Bummer's life, since his brother Jonathan, a wealthy pioneer, lives in San Francisco. One day, Jonathan turns his face toward the Sunset Trail. Clara Peterson (Winifred Goodwin) has been his nurse for over three years and her brother Jim (Val Paul) finds out they will receive $500 each for their services after his death. He is outraged they will get only that small amount of money.
Charles Gray (Thomas Meighan) is the school teacher who wants M'Liss to go to school as well. M'Liss isn't interested in an education. Charles keeps on pursuing her and she finally decides to go. He demands her to mind her manners when she's at school. She talks back to the boards members and is expelled. Charles, however, is charmed by the brave young girl. That same day, 'Bummer' gets stabbed in the back by an unknown person. The sheriff suspects Charles, since he was the last person to visit 'Bummer'.
When M'Liss is informed, she is crushed. She is invited to visit the murderer in jail and is shocked to find out it's Charles. Three weeks later, a murder trial starts. M'Liss is the only one believing in Charles' innocence. His wife Clara reaches town to visit him, only to find out he died. M'Liss refuses to believe she is her mother. Finally, Charles is sent to jail for 60 years. M'Liss helps him escape, but the police follow him. M'Liss witnesses them shooting Charles, but doesn't know they went after the wrong guy and actually shot Jim. Jim and Mexican Joe, the help of the sheriff, admit they killed 'Bummer' for his will. The fortune is now send to M'Liss and a hidden Charles is set free and reunites with M'Liss.

Mann Egerton Type H

The Mann Egerton Type H, also known as the Mann Egerton H.2, was a British ship-borne fighter aircraft of the 1910s.
Development.
The Type H was the first original design by Mann Egerton, and was designed by J W Carr to Air Ministry specification N.1a in . Its 2-bay biplane wings could be folded manually (a feature first introduced in 1913 on the Short Folder), due to its intended use as a naval fighter. Other features were the use of flotation chambers and a float attached to the underside of the fuselage for extra buoyancy. An innovation was that the undercarriage could be jettisoned if the aircraft needed to land on water. However, in autumn 1917, the aircraft failed flotation tests, and a new aircraft prototype, the Type H Mk I with single bay wings was drawn up.
The Mark II version had inflatable flotation bags in place of the large float on the Mk I, a more conventional undercarriage and a horn-balanced rudder. This aircraft was tested in December 1917, however it was deemed as unfit for use in the Fleet Air Arm and further development was discontinued.

Henny Moan

Henny Moan (born 22 February 1936) is a Norwegian actress from Finnmark. She has had a long career in theatre, but is best known for her roles in certain classics of Norwegian cinema, such as the Oscar-nominated "Ni liv" (1957) and "De dødes tjern" (1958). Moan was for a period married to the author André Bjerke.
Biography.
At the age of 17 she left her home in Finnmarkwhere she worked at a gas stationwithout telling anyone where she was going. She moved to Oslo where she applied to "Teaterhøyskolen" (the Theater Academy). Here she was accepted in the first intake in the history of the school, in 1953.
Moan has always been characterised by her short-cropped hair, a style she came up with in 1954, at a time when this was still quite uncommon for girls. She claims she originally did it because it was convenient, and because she had worn her hair like that as a child, to avoid lice and to make the hair grow out thicker.
From 1959 to 1972 Moan was married to celebrated Norwegian author André Bjerke. With Bjerke she had the daughter Vilde in 1960, who later wrote a book about her childhood. Henny and André lived together until their daughter was nine, at which point they separated.
Career.
Moan has acted both at Det Norske Teatret (the Norwegian Theater), Oslo Nye Teater and at Nationaltheatret (the National Theatre), in roles such as "Marguerite" in Dumas's "The Lady of the Camellias", and "Miss Julie" in Strindbergs play by that name. In 2006 she won the award "Aase Byes ærespris" for her effort in Ibsen-roles. She played her last part before retirement early in 2007. After retiring she started working on her autobiography.
She is also known for her work in movies, and had a role in the Oscar-nominated "Ni liv" in 1957. This film was in 2005 named the best movie in the history of Norwegian film, by a jury of movie critics. After this she received offers from Hollywood, but decided to stay in Norway. While married to Bjerke, she took part in the adaptation of his novel "De dødes tjern". Here she appeared in what was to become an iconic scene of Norwegian cinema, where she walks in a white, translucent dress along a tarn in the forest. More recently she had a brief part in Bent Hamer's critically acclaimed "O' Horten".
On television she is known from the science-fiction series "Blindpassasjer" (1978), written by Tor Åge Bringsværd and Jon Bing. Before this she played the part of "Edvarda" in a 1973 TV-series based on Knut Hamsun's novels "Benoni" and "Rosa". Moan also worked with television drama for several years.

MSX Video access method

The ColecoVision, SG-1000, CreatiVision, and first-generation MSX computers use the TMS9918A Video Display processor (VDP), which has its own 16 KiB of video memory that was not shared with main memory. Compared to the unified system and video memory used by other 8-bit computers of the time, such as the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64, separate memory has the advantage of freeing up of the Z80 processor's 64 KiB address space for main RAM, and the VDP doesn't need to steal CPU cycles to access video memory. The disadvantage is that the program has to use the CPU's dedicated I/O instructions to command the VDP to manipulate the contents of the video RAM. This not only slows down video access but also makes the porting of games from unified-memory platforms more difficult, specifically attempts of porting Sinclair spectrum games to MSX1 were often thwarted by this difference. Also, programmers had to learn to optimally use the more advanced capabilities of the VDP.
The TMS9918A's method of accessing the video RAM is slower than direct access, as used in unified-memory computers, because accessing video memory involved first outputting the low- then the hi-byte of the (14-bit) video memory address to I/O port $99, then one or more bytes of 8-bit data to port $98. After each write, the memory pointer advances to the next address, so consecutive addresses can be written to with repeated OUT instructions to $98. This also meant that the fast Z80 blockmove and blockfill instructions could not be used on the video memory.
However because of the screen layout, (which was top-down for each character of 8 lines then advancing to the next character) this was difficult to use for programmers who tried to convert existing software originally written for a system that had another arrangement of the screen layout. So when trying to use the TMS9918A high resolution mode video memory in the conventional way this method of indirect-access could be far slower than in 8-bit computers with unified memory, like any other piece of RAM. Consequently machines using this VDP could be inefficient at certain graphical tasks, such as scrolling games, which entailed moving the entire background memory. Instead of being able to use the Z80's efficient and fast block move instructions they had to write elaborate routines that first read bytes from video memory into system memory, and then back to another location in video memory, all one byte at a time.
To increase the speed to an acceptable level the programmers then often limited the scrolling to 8-pixel steps, which looked primitive in comparison to the 1 or 2 pixel scrolling steps available to the ZX Spectrum or Commodore 64 machines (although the Commodore 64 also used 8-pixel steps it had a fine-scroll register which could compensate for this, the MSX-1 did not).
The TMS9918A did have several features to make up for this shortfall, for example a programmable character set which allowed indirection, (to greatly increase scrolling because only the character table had to be moved, instead of the pixel data) and by having 32 hardware sprites. These sprites however were more limited than those in (for example) the Atari-8-bit systems. Because in their highest resolution they were only 16x16 pixels in a single-color (with transparency). A bigger drawback though was that in reality only scan line segments from a maximum of 4 sprites could simultaneously be displayed on any one picture scan line. Attempting to place a 5-th sprites scan line segment on the same scan line as the four others would result in flickering or missing scan line segments. Still, with care multiple multi-color sprites could be created this way, as many Japanese games prove. The Sinclair Spectrum did not have sprites, but when porting games it was often too much trouble to re-write the game structure to take advantage of the sprites. So most often they were simply ignored when porting games.
There were tricks available to circumvent the scrolling and other speed related problems by using clever programming techniques and video chip capabilities that were not available in the Sinclair Spectrum (the UK system most resembling MSX-1, and the source of most games that were ported to MSX in the UK), by using an undocumented text mode that supported multiple colors, and by using the built in re-programmable fonts, it was possible to combine high resolution graphics with faster scrolling while also being able to use sprites. This method was widely used by Japanese software producers, but rarely by British programmers who were porting Spectrum software.
They tried to use the MSX-1 as if it was a Spectrum. So games that were written from scratch, (mostly by Japanese programmers) made much better use of the capabilities of the TMS9918A. Also notable is that most of the video problems described above, especially sprite limits, were fixed with the newer MSX-2 video chips. However, by that time 16 bit systems like the Amiga and Atari ST had started to dominate the market.

Diocese of Chiusi-Pienza

The former Italian Catholic Diocese of Chiusi-Pienza, in Tuscany, existed until 1986. In that year it was united into the Diocese of Montepulciano-Chiusi-Pienza. It was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Siena.
History.
Catacombs are found at Chiusi. The martyrdom of the deacon Irenaeus and the virgin Mustiola probably took place under Valerian. The first known bishop was Florentius, present in 465 at the Roman synod under Pope Hilary. Ammiato Abbey was built by Ratchis, King of the Lombards, and afterwards rose to great power and influence.
Bishop Francesco degli Atti (1348) was a famous canonist. Chiusi formerly boasted of a famous relic, the betrothal ring of the Blessed Virgin, which was taken to Perugia about 1449 by an Augustinian friar; in consequence of this a war broke out between them, in which Perugia was victorious and remained in possession of the ring. 
The Diocese of Chiusi was at first immediately subject to the Holy See, but was made a suffragan of Siena by Pope Pius II. In 1773 Pope Clement XIV added to it the Diocese of Pienza.

Techstars

TechStars is a mentorship-driven startup accelerator founded by David Cohen, Brad Feld, David Brown, and Jared Polis that holds 13 week programs for startups in Boulder, New York City, Boston, Seattle, San Antonio, Austin and London. Fewer than 1% of the companies that apply to TechStars are accepted. Of the 114 companies that have completed its program, 92% are active. TechStars mentors include Foursquare CEO Dennis Crowley, tumblr CEO David Karp, HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah, and Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures.
History.
After founding three companies in Boulder, Colorado, David Cohen decided to form a startup accelerator and began building a network of mentors within Boulder. The network would simultaneously bring together potentially interesting companies, leverage the entrepreneurial community behind these companies for three months, and then decide whether to invest further. 
He enlisted Brad Feld, who had invested in some of the same companies as Cohen. They partnered with David Brown, co-founder and president of Zoll Data Systems, and Jared Polis, founder of BlueMountain and ProFlowers, to form TechStars. They recruited 70 web entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and CEOs to provide mentoring. 
The company was established in Boulder in 2006 and held its first program in 2007 with an initial 10 companies. Of the 10, 2 were acquired that same year, 3 achieved positive exits by 2012, and 2 currently generate millions in annual revenue. TechStars used the revenue from these successful exits to expand to four additional cities: in 2009, in Boston; 2010, in Seattle; 2011, in New York City; 2012, a "cloud" program in San Antonio; 2013 in Austin. David Tisch, founder and former managing director of the company’s New York branch, states that TechStars deliberately selected locations away from Silicon Valley because these areas had been relatively overlooked by other entrepreneurs. "
In January 2011, the firm launched the Global Accelerator Network, which links 22 similar programs internationally. The network was launched in conjunction with President Barack Obama’s Startup America Partnership. In September 2011, the firm was featured as the subject of a 7-episode reality TV series on Bloomberg TV. The series follows 6 startups in their New York City program.
Structure.
Startups can apply for TechStars’ program and their viability is judged by the program’s directors. Less than 1% of applicants are accepted into the program. In particular, of the 1,500 applicants to the TechStars New York Spring 2012 program, 14 were selected. TechStars provides each company with free office space and $18,000 in exchange for a 6% stake in the company. In addition, a syndicate of more than 75 top venture capitalists backs each company with a $100,000 convertible note which converts into equity when the company raises a Series A.
One of TechStars’ goals is to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystems in the 5 cities in which they operate. There are between 50 and 100 mentors in each city for 10 to 15 companies. 
Boot Camp.
Accepted founders participate in a three-month program in their program’s city. While there, the founders develop their business under the guidance of mentors and meet with potential investors through TechStars’ network of connections. Mentors for accepted startups include: Foursquare CEO Dennis Crowley, tumblr CEO David Karp, HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah, Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, and Howard Lindzon of StockTwits.
Cohen refers to the TechStars boot camp as three one-month programs. In the first month the founders engage the mentors and receive feedback on their product or service. The goal of the first month is to orient the team in the correct direction, with Cohen stating that this is when many companies pivot their focus, market strategy, or idea. In the second month, founders work with their mentors on specific issues like customer interaction, partner opportunities, and product development. In the third month, founders develop a plan for action after TechStars, which includes fundraising, pitching investors, launching the product, or developing a company strategy. 
At the end of the 13-week program, TechStars hosts "Demo Day", which can draw over 500 investors, entrepreneurs, and journalists.
Results and reception.
The "New York Times" notes that “One of the biggest lures of the program is the unlimited access the start-ups get to established tech community mentors.” Of the 114 companies that have graduated from the TechStars program, 98 are active, 8 have been acquired, and 8 have failed. The success rate for most technology start-ups is estimated at 10%. Companies that have participated in TechStars programs currently employ 772 people and 90% of those companies receive funding after graduating. Techstars does not report financial results of its overall portfolio of companies, so, analysis of the financial results of TechStars's stake in its startups is anecdotal at best.

Chameleon Dreams

Chameleon Dreams is the second solo album by Margaret Urlich, released in 1992. The first single from the album, "Boy In The Moon", was highly successful, reaching the top ten in New Zealand. The video for the single was filmed in Paris. The Album achieved platinum status in both New Zealand and Australia.
Recording.
In March 1991, Urlich, armed with a half million dollar recording budget, returned to the studio to commence pre-production for her second album, "Chameleon Dreams", with English writer/producer Robyn Smith, the man behind her highly successful debut. By mid year, Urlich and Smith had entered Sydney's 301 Studios to record their two songs, plus a third track written by Smith and Barry Blue. The same team had been responsible for two of the best tracks on Safety in Numbers ("Escaping" and "Guilty People"), and their latest offering "Boy In The Moon", proved pivotal to the sound of the new album. Other tracks were collected by travelling all over the world.
First Urlich went to London to co-write with celebrated writers like Rob Fisher with whom she wrote the album's title track "Chameleon Dreams". She then went on to Los Angeles, where she met up with Grammy Award-winning writer/producer Ian Prince, and with whom she wrote two songs for the album and he produced four tracks. She returned to London again, where she co-wrote a number of songs with Simon Law and Tony Swain before completing the project with three tracks produced by Swain.
The success of "Chameleon Dreams" earned Urlich the "Best Selling New Zealand Artist of the Year" award at The 1992 World Music Awards in Monte Carlo. She attended the awards ceremony and performed "Love Train".
"Chameleon Dreams" was nominated for two ARIA Award in 1993 and has sold over 75,000 copies.
