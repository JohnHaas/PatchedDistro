Energy in Finland

Finland lacks domestic sources of fossil energy and must import substantial amounts of petroleum, natural gas, and other energy resources, including uranium for nuclear power.
Overview.
There was no sustainable decline in CO2 emission in Finland during 1990–2007. The energy use decline 2008–2009 is based on recession and at least some paper industry factories relocation abroad. The annual changes of CO2 emissions of Finland were in some years 7–20% during 1990–2007. Increase of emissions was 18% in 1996 and 20% in 2006. The peat energy use and CO2 emissions per capita had correlation in 1990–2007.
Consumption.
Energy consumption increased 44 percent in electricity and 30 percent in the total energy use from 1990 to 2006. The increase in electricity consumption 15,000 GWh from 1995 to 2005 was more than the total hydropower capacity. The electricity consumption increased almost equally in all sectors (industry, homes, and services). The share of electricity generated from renewable energy in Finland has been stable from 1998 to 2005: 11 to 12 percent plus yearly changing hydropower, together around 24 to 27 percent. The RE of total energy has been 24 percent (1998 to 2005). The forest industry black liquor and forest industry wood burning were 57 percent (1990) and 67 percent (2005) of the RE of total energy. The rest is mainly water power. The most of available hydropower for energy is already in use. The forest industry uses 30 percent of all electricity in Finland (1990–2005). Its process wastes, wood residues and black liquor, gave 7000–8000 GWh RE electricity in 2005. In the year 2005 this and electricity consumption fell 10% compared to 2004 based on the long forest industry strike. Finland consumed (2005) 17.3 MWh electricity per capita compared to Germany 7.5 MWh per capita. This number includes the power losses of the distribution.
Electricity.
In 2009 the consumption of energy sources in electricity generation by mode of production was: 28% nuclear power, 16% hydro power, 13% coal, 11% natural gas, 5% peat and 10% wood fuels and other renewables. Net imports of electricity in 2009 were 15%. In 2011, 16% of electricity consumption was derived from imported electricity.
European Commission (EC) demanded for Finland a €32,000-day penalty from the Court of Justice of the European Union in March 2013 for not implementing the electricity directive in time.
Houses.
80% of the energy use of households was spent on heating in 2008–2011.
Energy sources.
Fossil fuels.
Petroleum.
In 2007 oil imports were almost 11 million tonnes in Finland. In 2006, Finnish oil imports came from Russia (64 percent), Norway (11 percent), Denmark (11 percent), and the rest from United Kingdom, Kazakhstan, and Algeria. Petroleum comprises 24 percent of Finnish energy consumption. Most of petroleum is used in vehicles, but about 260,000 homes are heated by heating oil.
Neste Oil is the sole oil refiner in Finland, exporting petroleum products such as gasoline and fuel oil to Baltic countries and North America. Oil imports were valued at 6.5 billion euros and exports 3 billion euros in 2006.
Natural gas.
In 2010 the share of gas in TPES was about 10%. Finland was 100% dependent on a single supplier in gas, namely Russia. There is no gas storage capacity. There is alternative fuel obligation. The neighbouring country Sweden was 100% dependent on Danish gas in 2010. The share of gas in Sweden was lower than in Finland, 3.5% in 2009 (13 Twh gas /376 Twh total final use). The gas dependency in Finland and Sweden was less than in average in OECD countries in 2010. 16 out of 28 IEA member countries are dependent on gas over 20% in TPES.
Natural gas has been used since 1974 after the first oil crisis. Gasum is the Finnish importer and seller of natural gas, which owns and operates Finnish natural gas transmission system. Natural gas vehicles aren't popular in Finland, but natural gas powered busses exist.
Coal.
Coal is imported from Russia and Poland. 5.6 million tonnes were used in 2007.
According to Finnwatch (27 September 2010) there are 13 coal power plants in Finland. The companies Pohjolan Voima, Fortum, Helsingin Energia and Rautaruukki consume coal most. According to the statistics of the Customs 18.3 million tonnes of coal was imported in Finland between 2007–2009 from: 72.5% Russia; 7.3% USA; 6.6% Canada; 5.9% Australia; 3.0% Poland, 1.4% South Africa; 1.3% Colombia and 1.1% Indonesia. The majority of Finnish coal is mined in the Kuznetsk Basin of the Kemerovo Oblast, Russia.
The Finnish companies know the country of origin of coal. The specific mine of origin is not always known, especially for the coal blends. According to the Finnwatch inquiry in 2010 none of the Finnish companies have yet made a commitment to give up coal consumption. Based on new investments, companies reported the following reductions in their future coal use: Helsingin Energia −40 % by 2020, Lahti Energia several tens of % by 2012 and Vantaan Energia −30 % by 2014.
The ILO Agreement 176 (1995) addresses health and safety risks in mines. Finland ratified the agreement in 1997. However, in 2010 the agreement was not ratified in the following countries that export coal to Finland: Russia, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Kazakstan, Indonesia and China. At least two companies in Finland reported (2010) using the UN Global Compact initiative criteria in their supplier relationships. No Finnish company reported signing the UN Global Compact Initiative. According to the DanWatch report ”The Curse of Coal” Danish DONG Energy and Swedish Vattenfall have underlined UN Global Compact Initiative.
Peat.
Peat and hard coal are the most harmful energy sources for global warming in Finland. According to VTT studies peat is often the most harmful one.
Peat is the most popular energy source in Finland for new energy investments 2005–2015. The new energy plants in Finland starting 2005–2015 have as energy source: peat 36% and hard coal 11%: combined: 47%. The major carbon dioxide emitting peat plants during 2005–15 are/will be (CO2 kt): PVO 2700 kt, Jyväskylän Energia 561 kt, Etelä-Pohjanmaan Voima Oy (EPV Energia) 374 kt, Kuopion Energia 186 kt, UPM Kymmene 135 kt and Vapo 69 kt. EPV Energy is partner in TVO nuclear plants and Jyväskylän and Kuopion Energia partners in Fennovoima nuclear plants in Finland.
According to IEA country report the Finnish subsidies for peat undermine the goal to reduce CO2 emissions and counteracts other environmental policies and The European Union emissions trading scheme. IEA recommends to adhere to the timetable to phase out the peat subsidies in 2010. “To encourage sustained production of peat in the face of negative incentives from the European Union's emissions trading scheme for greenhouse gases, Finland has put in place a premium tariff scheme to subsidise peat. The premium tariff is designed to directly counter the effect of the European Union's emissions trading scheme.”
Nuclear power.
As of 2008, Finland's nuclear power program has four nuclear reactors in two power plants. The first of these came into operation in 1977. In 2007 they provided 28.4% of Finland's electricity. They are among the world's most efficient, with average capacity factors of 94% in the 1990s. A fifth nuclear reactor is under construction, scheduled to go online in 2015.
Renewable energy.
Energy companies have no renewable energy obligations in Finland.
The share of renewable energy in per cent in Finland was 28% in 2012 and 25% in 2000. The share of renewable energy 5 years average 2006–2010 was 24.7 % and 10 years average 2001–2010 was 26.0 %. The share of renewable energy in Finland:
Renewable energy of electricity (2005):
The renewable energy objectives set by the European Union are 22 percent renewable source electricity and 12 percent renewable of primary energy by 2010 under the European Union directive 2003/30/EC (Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport) and white paper. This includes the objectives of 40 GW wind power, 3 GW photovoltaics and 5.75 percent biofuels by 2010.
Energy use.
Traffic.
The Kioto agreement had obligation to restrict the traffic emissions in Finland between 2008–12 in the year 1990 level. According to Ministry report in 2004 the share of public tansport in Finland is lower that in the most European countries.
Energy policy.
The objective of RE (2005) of electricity was 35% (1997–2010). However, (2006) the Finnish objective was dropped to 31.5% (1997–2010). According to 'Renewables Global Status Report' Finland aims to increase RE only 2% in 13 years. This objective to add the RE use with 2% in 13 years is among the modest of all the EU countries.
Carbon emissions.
The Finnish CO2 emissions grew 14.5% (1990:2004), when EU average was – 0.6%. According to the Finnish RE organisations and Finnish public the potential of RE increase in Finland is huge.
The carbon dioxide emissions by fossil fuels in 2008 originated from 45% oil, 39% coal and 15% natural gas. In the year 2000 the shares were nearly equal: 48% oil and 37% coal. The fossil traffic fuels: motor petrol, diesel and aviation petrol are oil products. The biomass included 47% of black liquer and 52% of wood in 2008. These shares were practically same during 1990–2006. All biomass and agricultural warming gas emissions are free of charge in the EU emissions trading in 2008–2012. According to the official statistics the annual fossil fuel and coal emissions in Finland have large annual variation. E.g. the fossil fuel CO2 emissions dropped 18% in the year 2005 and 13% in 2008, but the annual coal emissions increased 22% in 1996, 22% in 2001 and 58% in 2006.
According to the energy statistics the major changing factors for the annual emission changes were the consumption of coal and peat. In 2006 the hard coal increase was 92% subject to industry (including energy producing industry) separate electricity generation from hard coal. At the same time the controversial peat consumption was increased. The district heating used 42% of hard coal in average 1990–2006, but its annual variation was small compared to the industry separate electricity generation.

Marlow Rowing Club

Marlow Rowing Club is an amateur rowing club on the River Thames in England. It is situated on the southern bank of the Thames at Bisham in Berkshire, opposite the town of Marlow, Buckinghamshire just beside Marlow Bridge and on the reach above Marlow Lock. Founded in 1871, it is one of the main rowing and sculling centres in England. Members of the Club have represented Great Britain in the Olympic Games and World Championships.
The club rows from Marlow up to Temple Lock (approximately 2 km), and from below Marlow Lock down to Cookham (approximately 5 km). The former stretch is the home of Marlow Town Regatta, Marlow Spring Regatta and FirstRow Challenge, and the latter the setting for Marlow Long Distance Sculls and Marlow Fours and Pairs. The Marlow Regatta moved to Dorney Lake in 2001. 
Off the water the club also runs the "Rower's Revenge" Triathlon which consists of rowing machines, cycling and running and is held in October each year.
Colours.
The club colour is cardinal, although the current club kit is closer in colour to maroon. All-in-ones are maroon with a white stripe down the side and the club crest on the front. Shirts are white with a maroon stripe on the arm and the word "Marlow" picked out in white lettering. Leggings are black with a maroon stripe down the side. The colour scheme is not dissimilar to that of Vesta Rowing Club or Oxford Brookes University.

Amaya Salazar

Amaya Salazar (born 1951, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic) is a Dominican artist known for her faceless personas that inhabit mystical and magical environments where light and the Antillean flora are present.
Biography.
Amaya Salazar studied at the Academia Artium, Madrid, Spain and at the School of Fine Arts, Boston, U.S.A.
Salazar is mostly inspired by the female form and by mother and child images. She captures those intimate moments where women are escaping the reality of life and entering the warm of the Caribbean light.
Light and flora play an important role in Salazar's work. In her work, the rays of the sun and moon create kaleidoscope of tones throughout the landscape. In the nightscapes the palette turns dark almost black, but there is always an internal light that shines. Her brighter works give us the different tonalities that the sun create as it warms the landscape. The flora is an integral part of Salazar’s work. The banana leaves, the palm trees, the bamboo trunks are part of the environment that surround the characters; in some cases they are the only element of the piece.
Salazar also works in bronze, steel, and marble as well as creates charcoal on paper drawings and water color and Chinese ink on paper.
Her work can be found in important collections worldwide. There are two monographs about the artist’s work and a third one is being produced.

Health impact of nanotechnology

The health impact of nanotechnology are the possible effects that the use of nanotechnological materials and devices will have on human health. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent nanotechnology will benefit or pose risks for human health. Nanotechnology's health impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to have medical applications to cure disease, and the potential health hazards posed by exposure to nanomaterials.
Nanotoxicology.
The extremely small size of nanomaterials also means that they are much more readily taken up by the human body than larger sized particles. How these nanoparticles behave inside the body is one of the issues that needs to be resolved. The behavior of nanoparticles is a function of their size, shape and surface reactivity with the surrounding tissue. They could cause overload on phagocytes, cells that ingest and destroy foreign matter, thereby triggering stress reactions that lead to inflammation and weaken the body’s defense against other pathogens. Apart from what happens if non-degradable or slowly degradable nanoparticles accumulate in organs, another concern is their potential interaction with biological processes inside the body: because of their large surface, nanoparticles on exposure to tissue and fluids will immediately adsorb onto their surface some of the macromolecules they encounter. This may, for instance, affect the regulatory mechanisms of enzymes and other proteins.
Other properties of nanomaterials that influence toxicity include: chemical composition, shape, surface structure, surface charge, aggregation and solubility,
and the presence or absence of functional groups of other chemicals.
The large number of variables influencing toxicity means that it is difficult to generalise about health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials – each new nanomaterial must be assessed individually and all material properties must be taken into account.
California.
In October 2008, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), within the California Environmental Protection Agency, announced its intent to request information regarding analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information from manufacturers of carbon nanotubes. DTSC is exercising its authority under the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020. These sections were added as a result of the adoption of Assembly Bill AB 289 (2006). They are intended to make information on the fate and transport, detection and analysis, and other information on chemicals more available. The law places the responsibility to provide this information to the Department on those who manufacture or import the chemicals.
On January 22, 2009, a formal information request letter was sent to manufacturers who produce or import carbon nanotubes in California, or who may export carbon nanotubes into the State. This letter constitutes the first formal implementation of the authorities placed into statute by AB 289 and is directed to manufacturers of carbon nanotubes, both industry and academia within the State, and to manufacturers outside California who export carbon nanotubes to California. This request for information must be met by the manufacturers within one year. DTSC is waiting for the upcoming January 22, 2010 deadline for responses to the data call-in.
The California Nano Industry Network and DTSC hosted a full-day symposium on November 16, 2009 in Sacramento, CA. This symposium provided an opportunity to hear from nanotechnology industry experts and discuss future regulatory considerations in California.
DTSC is expanding the Specific Chemical Information Call-in to members of the nanometal oxides. Interested individuals are encouraged to visit their website for the latest up-to-date information at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm.
Nanomedicine.
Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology. The approaches to nanomedicine range from the medical use of nanomaterials, to nanoelectronic biosensors, and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology. Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials.
Nanomedicine research is directly funded, with the US National Institutes of Health in 2005 funding a five-year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers. In April 2006, the journal Nature Materials estimated that 130 nanotech-based drugs and delivery systems were being developed worldwide.
Nanomedicine seeks to deliver a set of research tools and clinical devices in the near future. The National Nanotechnology Initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems, new therapies, and "in vivo" imaging. Neuro-electronic interfaces and other nanoelectronics-based sensors are another active goal of research. Further down the line, the speculative field of molecular nanotechnology believes that cell repair machines could revolutionize medicine and the medical field.
Nanomedicine is a large industry, with nanomedicine sales reaching $6.8 billion in 2004. With over 200 companies and 38 products worldwide, a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology R&D is being invested every year. As the nanomedicine industry continues to grow, it is expected to have a significant impact on the economy.
Curing diseases.
Currently, nanotech gene therapy has been able to kill ovarian cancer in mice while avoiding the side effects of "cisplatin" and "paclitaxel"; it is speculated that this technology could save 15000 women in the United States each year if the treatment proves effective and safe in humans.
Research on nanoelectronics-based cancer diagnostics could lead to tests that can be done in pharmacies. The results promise to be highly accurate and the product promises to be inexpensive. They could take a very small amount of blood and detect cancer anywhere in the body in about five minutes, with a sensitivity that is a thousand times better than in a conventional laboratory test. These devices that are built with nanowires to detect cancer proteins; each nanowire detector is primed to be sensitive to a different cancer marker. The biggest advantage of the nanowire detectors is that they could test for anywhere from ten to one hundred similar medical conditions without adding cost to the testing device. Nanotechnology has also helped to personalize oncology for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. It is now able to be tailored to each individual’s tumor for better performance. They have found ways that they will be able to target a specific part of the body that is being affected by cancer.
Along with the possibility of curing cancer, doctors have found ways to make surgery come a long way with nanotechnology. Arthroscopic surgery would be the best example. Nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes, which are pencil-sized devices that are used in surgeries with lights and cameras so surgeons can do the surgeries with smaller incisions. The smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients. Arthroscopic surgery is hoping to make the scope smaller than a strand of hair in the future.
Also using nanotechnology doctors are looking to find a way to reuse the material of an old part of the body to rebuild new tissue. The use of old parts of the body to rebuild new tissue would help to make sure you are using your own tissue in the your body and will also help so your body will not reject the tissue.

Children's Discovery System

The Mattel Children's Discovery System was an early electronic educational toy product released by Mattel in 1981. The Children's Discovery System was targeted toward children aged 6 to 11 and mimicked the look of a contemporary consumer-grade computer.
Specifications.
The Children's Discovery System used a 16-by-48 matrix LCD screen and was powered by six size AA alkaline batteries. The screen was much wider than it was tall, therefore only a grid of 8-by-2 text was possible, allowing for a maximum of 16 characters on-screen at any given moment.
The unit came preprogrammed with three modes: Art mode, Music mode and Type mode. The Discovery System came with a specially laid-out membrane keyboard to better accommodate the built-in modes and also made use of keyboard overlays for use with expansion modules. Also included with the unit was a large activity book with over 100 suggested learning activities specially-tailored for the Discovery System.

1967 v Australia (Sydney) W 11-5
That Walsh's prowess was mainly defensive was shown by his scoring record: it was not until his 26th appearance that he managed a try for Ireland. But the occasion, that famous victory at Sydney Cricket Ground, could scarcely have been bettered. With that he retired, in order better to pursue his career as a doctor.
Walsh was selected for the 1966 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand, but did not play in any of the internationals as he returned home early from Australia due to the serious illness of his father . He also toured South Africa and Australia with Ireland in 1961 and 1967 respectively.
He played club rugby for University College Cork RFC and Sundays Well.

Malerisaurus

Malerisaurus is an extinct genus of prolacertiform archosauromorph known from Andhra Pradesh of India and Texas of the USA.
Description.
"Malerisaurus" was a medium-sized prolacertiforme which averaged 1.2 meters in length. "Malerisaurus" is known from the holotype ISIR 150, two articulated and almost complete skeletons which were discovered as the presumable gastric contents of two skeletons of "Parasuchus hislopi". It was collected from the Lower Maleri Formation, dating to the late Carnian or early Norian stage of the Late Triassic. "Malerisaurus robinsonae" was a small archosauromorph, probably capable of climbing trees and swimming. The skull has some adaptations to a carnivorous diet, but is nevertheless unspecialised and probably more of an insectivore. "Malerisaurus", seen as a diapsid skull, shows primitive and advanced facies in its unossified laterosphenoid, absence of antorbital and mandibular fenestrae, gracile form, primitive girdles, elongated cervicals and absence of dermal armour. The suborder Prolacertiformes currently represents four families: Sharovipterygidae, Protorosauridae, Prolacertidae and Tanystropheidae. Chatterjee provisionally regarded "Malerisaurus" as close to "Protorosaurus".
A second species, "M. langstoni", is known from the holotype TMM 31099-11, a partial but poorly preserved skeleton. It was collected in the Otis Chalk Quarry 2 (TMM 31099 locality) from the Colorado City Formation, Chinle Group, dating to the early Carnian stage of the Late Triassic, about 228-227.5 million years ago. It was found in the Howard County of Texas.
Etymology.
"Malerisaurus" was named by Sankar Chatterjee in 1980 and the type species is "Malerisaurus robinsonae". A second species, "M. langstoni", was named by him in 1986. The generic name is derived from the name of the Lower Maleri Formation, where the holotype of the type species was collected, and "sauros", Greek for "lizard". The specific name of "M. langstoni" honors the American paleontologist and professor Wann Langston, Jr..

Canon EF-S 18–200mm lens

The Canon EF-S 18–200mm lens is a superzoom lens, manufactured by Canon. It is the higher end kit lens for the Canon EOS 60D digital camera, and supplants the previous EF-S 17–85mm, in Canon's product line-up, losing 1mm off the wide end, but offering a roughly 2.5x longer telephoto end.
While Canon has produced superzooms for the full frame EF mount, they function only as normal length to long telephoto lenses on cameras equipped with APS-C sensors. This is the first EF-S lens made by Canon to offer both wide-angle and telephoto shooting range in the same package. Other manufacturers, including Sigma and Tamron have had similar lenses available for EF-S cameras for some time; however, their lenses generally only work at 6.3 when fully zoomed in, which can make autofocusing unreliable (Canon's APS-C cameras are only designed to autofocus up to 5.6). Canon's version is a third of a stop faster when fully zoomed in, which means that autofocusing is more reliable, and the lens is slightly faster as well.
It is almost functionally identical to the Canon 28–300L lens, which also has image stabilization and comparable apertures and focal lengths when mounted on a 35mm (or full-frame) camera. Reviews indicate that the 18–200 does not compare to the 28–300L in terms of image quality, though this is understandable since the latter is priced much higher, due to it belonging to the L-series line. Most reviewers have criticised the lens for high levels of barrel distortion at the wide end, and chromatic aberration and softness evident at all focal lengths and apertures. The lack of an UltraSonic Motor has also been noted by reviewers, and along with the 18–55 IS has given rise to concerns that Canon may be moving towards removing USM from their lower-end lenses. It has generally been rated higher than Sigma and Tamron's offerings however, and has received generally positive reviews with the caveat that it is designed for convenience rather than image quality.
A combination of similar-class EF-S lenses that covers this range of focal lengths is the EF-S 18–55mm and the EF-S 55–250mm.

Orthopaedic sports medicine

Orthopaedic Sports Medicine is a subspecialty of orthopaedic medicine and sports medicine. The word orthopaedic derives from “ortho” which is the Greek root for “straight” and “pais” which is the Greek root for child. During the early history of orthopaedic medicine, orthopaedists used braces, among other things, to make a child “straight.” Today, orthopaedists are making people of all ages “straight,” including athletes from all different kinds of sports. 
Subspecialty: Orthopaedic Sports Medicine.
The phrase “sports medicine” is not specific to one career/profession. It instead, encompasses a group of professionals from various disciplines whose focus is the health of an athlete. Athletes can be all ages and play on all different levels (youth, high school, collegiate, recreational, and professional). 
Orthopaedic sports medicine is the investigation, preservation, and restoration by medical, surgical, and rehabilitative means to all structures of the musculoskeletal system affected by athletic activity. 
Orthopaedic Sports Medicine Specialist.
Any Accredited Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) residency trained orthopaedist can practice orthopaedic sports medicine. Their training specifically provides them with the skills to care for athletes’ musculoskeletal needs. 
What They Do.
Orthopaedic sports medicine specialists…
What they Know.
Orthopaedic sports medicine specialists have a knowledge of…
Schooling.
A person interested in becoming an orthopaedic sports medicine specialist must complete four years of medical school. After their undergraduate schooling is completed, training continues with a five year residency in orthopaedics. In order to sub-specialize, which is the case with an orthopaedic sports medicine, a one-year fellowship is required, although some programs extend two to four years. 
After they have finished their training and have graduated from an accredited residency, orthopaedic surgeons are eligible to become certified by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS). Certification by the Board is required in order to practice. In addition, the orthopaedist who plans on specializing in sports medicine must complete certification in the sports medicine sub-specialty which is administered by the ABOS. 
Education does not stop there; orthopaedists are required to take continuing education classes to maintain their license.
Careers.
Orthopaedist specializing in sports medicine have various options of employment: from serving as a team’s physician (high school, college, and professional), to running a private practice, to working in the academic setting. 
According to a salary.com, the data they collected from HR reported data in August 2008 showed that an orthopaedic surgeon, on average, made about $396,343 a year not including bonuses and benefits.

Poeh Museum

The Poeh Museum (Tewa translates "poeh" to mean "pathway") is a museum in Pojoaque, New Mexico, U.S.A. The museum is located off U.S. Route 84. It is devoted to the arts and culture of the Puebloan peoples, especially the Tewas in the northern part of the state. It was founded by Pojoaque Pueblo in 1987, and is housed in the Poeh Center. The museum organizes changing exhibitions, and is a large repository of permanent artifacts and programs. The museum has run the Oral Histories Documentation, which is part of the Museum's records, which involved participation of 38 Tewa elders providing stories about their lives; the information is available in both Tewa and English.
Location.
The building is located off of Highway 84. It is near Pojoaque Pueblo's Cities of Gold Casino and Hotel, and about from Santa Fe.
History.
The museum was established in 1987 by the Pojoaque Pueblo. Its mission is to promote the work of Pueblan artists and the culture of Pueblan people from pre-European period to the present age. Construction on the Poeh Center, where the museum is currently housed, started in 1992 with gaming revenue, and was completed in 2003. Funding was also provided for the museum's development by the Pojoaque Pueblo Construction Services Corporation, the New Mexico State Legislature, the Bay Foundation, the New Mexico Youth Conservation Corps, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Joyce Begah-Foss served as curator in the 1990s, while Vernon Lujan has served as director in the 2000s.
Poeh Center.
The museum is located in the Poeh Center, which is widely recognized for its traditional pueblo architecture and building techniques. It also houses the Poeh Arts educational program, the Poeh Tower Gallery, and administrative offices. The Poeh Tower is the tallest adobe structure in New Mexico.
The main attraction in the museum is entered through a narrow hall which appears as a cave-like opening. A water channel passes through the entire length of the exhibits. The gallery is provided with a state-of-the-art security system, a Fire Suppression System including climate control system which was funded through a grant of US$109,217 by the National Endowment for the Humanities. In recognition of the Museum and Cultural center's contribution to the revival of culture and its propagation, Harvard University awarded the Poeh Center with the “Honoring Nations” award in 2000.
Collections.
There are roughly 600 artifacts of historical interest, which include paintings, jewelry, pottery, textiles, and sculptures of pre-European period to date. The pieces are by local people as well as by young artists of the six Tewa speaking tribes which helps students under the Poeh Arts Program to learn and adopt their culture. The exhibits consist of a number of figurines dressed with skins bordered with fur. The figurines are shown in a snow covered landscape with hunting implements such as spears and atlatls. The figurines are made of very short stature with dark skin and with large wide eyes and round feet. These figurines were made by Swentzel, a local clay sculptor.
The history of the Pueblan people is depicted in a sequence emerging from Sipapu, past hunting and gathering period, to the initial practices of agriculture, and then through the Spanish Entrada and finally ending in a modern-day living room of a family. The permanent exhibit, "Nah Poeh Meng" ("Along the Continuous Path"), was created by Mark Van Wickler and Iron Orca Studios of Washington State. It portrays pueblo history from the Pueblan viewpoint, and features sculptures by Roxanne Swentzell and murals by Marcellus Medina of Zia Pueblo. This permanent exhibit which opened on 14 August 2005 is created in a floor area of . It provides recorded information through the voices of local people, provided in the seven different languages – Tewa, Tiwa, Towa, Keresan, Zuni, Spanish, and English spoken by the local people. The presentation is unique as it adopts visual arts as the medium, without any text.
Services.
The museum and cultural centre collections are also used for teaching and research by students. To promote this research activity, the museum has officially established links with many institutions such as the Southwest Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA), the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, Santa Fe Indian School, the Institute of American Indian Arts, Northern New Mexico College, and the School for Advanced Research. An on-line access of archival, photographic, and permanent collection is also available for classroom training. This was facilitated under the National Endowment for the Arts Technology Program. This archive also provides information on the festivals of Pueblans, their dances, architecture, agriculture in addition to aspects related to economic development of Pojoaque. The museum archive holds about 10,000 photographs, ranging from early Edward S. Curtis prints to snapshots of contemporary Pueblan life. Approximately 5,000 of these images have been catalogued and digitized, and the remainder were expected to have been completed by the end of 2009. Its displays have included contemporary textiles, and these were complemented by weaving classes.
To encourage local talent, the museum also provides free studio space to any Native American artist.
The museum holds frequent art demonstrations and traditional dance festivals. The museum gift shop features art and gifts unique to Pueblo culture.

Wilhelm Brasse

Wilhelm Brasse (3 December 1917 – 23 October 2012) was a Polish professional photographer and a prisoner in Auschwitz during World War II. He became known as the "famous photographer of Auschwitz concentration camp"; his life and work were the subject of the 2005 Polish television documentary film "The Portraitist" ("Portrecista"), which first aired in the "Proud to Present" series on the Polish TVP1 on 1 January 2006.
Brasse was of mixed Austrian-Polish descent. He learned photography in Katowice at the atelier of his own aunt. After the 1939 German invasion of Poland and occupation of Brasse's hometown Żywiec, in southern Poland, he was interrogated by the Schutzstaffel (SS). He refused to swear allegiance to Hitler, and was imprisoned for three months. After his release, still refusing to capitulate to the Volksliste and forced membership of German Army, he tried to escape to Hungary and join the Polish Army in France but was captured, along with other young men, at the Polish–Hungarian border and deported to KL Auschwitz-Birkenau as prisoner number 3444. Trained before the beginning of World War II as a portrait photographer in Silesia, he was ordered by the SS camp administrators to photograph "prisoners' work, criminal medical experiments, portraits of the prisoners for the files." Brasse has estimated that he took 40,000 to 50,000 "identity pictures" from 1940 until 1945, before being moved to another concentration camp in Austria, where he was liberated by the American forces in May 1945.
While many of Brasse's photographs did not survive, some are on display in the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum and at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority, Israel's official memorial to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust. His photographs inspired "Painting Czesława Kwoka" (2007), which won a literary award.
Personal history.
Wilhelm Brasse was born on 3 December 1917 to a descendant of Austrian colonists and a Polish mother in Żywiec, in the Partitioned Poland. His father was a Polish soldier in the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. Wilhelm Brasse was "trained as a portrait photographer in a studio owned by his aunt" in Katowice, and "had an eye for the telling image and an ability to put his subjects at ease."
After the September 1939 invasion of Poland, he was pressured by the Nazis to join them, refused, was repeatedly interrogated by the Gestapo, and tried to escape to France via Hungary, but he was captured at the Polish-Hungarian border and incarcerated for four months. After continuing to refuse to "declare his loyalty to Hitler", on 31 August 1940, he was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, soon after it opened.
In February 1941, after having been called to the office of Rudolf Höß, Auschwitz's commander, along with four others, and tested for "photographic skills", he was selected specifically for his "laboratory skills" and "technical ability with a camera" and for his ability to speak German, and then ordered to document the Nazi prisoners in the camp in the "Erkennungsdienst, the photographic identification unit." A year and a half later, Brasse encountered Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor who "liked" his photographs and wanted him to photograph some of the twins and people with congenital disorders moved to his infirmary on whom Mengele was "experimenting". After the Soviets entered Poland, during the Vistula-Oder Offensive, from 12 January to 2 February 1945, along with thousands of other Auschwitz prisoners, Brasse was forcibly moved to Austria, to the concentration camp in Ebensee, a subcamp of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex (the last remaining in the area still controlled by the Nazis), where he remained imprisoned until the American forces liberated him in early May 1945.
After returning home to Żywiec, a "few miles from" KL Auschwitz-Birkenau, Brasse tried to start "taking pictures again", but, traumatized, he found himself haunted by the "ghosts" of the "dead"—the subjects of his hundreds of thousands of Auschwitz pictures—and unable to resume his work as a portrait photographer, he ultimately established what would become a "moderately prosperous" sausage casing business.
Although he had gone back to the State Museum at Auschwitz-Birkenau, "to talk with visitors about his experiences", and although he still possessed a "small pre-war Kodak" camera, he would "never take another photograph."
He died in Żywiec, at the age of 94. He was married with two children and five grandchildren, and lived with his wife until his death. His death was announced by an Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum historian.
The Auschwitz photographs.
Trained before the beginning of World War II as a portrait photographer at his aunt's studio, he was ordered by his SS supervisors to photograph "prisoners' work, criminal medical experiments, portraits of the prisoners for the files." Brasse has estimated that he took about 40,000 to 50,000 "identity pictures" from 1940 until 1945, before being forcibly moved to another concentration camp in Austria, where he was liberated by the American forces in early May 1945.
Dr. Mengele had insisted that Brasse take the "identity" portraits of Auschwitz prisoners "in three poses: from the front and from each side." After taking hundreds of thousands of such photographs, Brasse and others disobeyed later Nazi orders to destroy them, yet only some of his photos have survived:although it is hard to say which were Brasse's, since camp photos as a rule didn't carry the photographer's name[,] ... Jarosław Mensfelt, spokesman of the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum, says some 200,000 such pictures were taken, with name, nationality and profession attached. ... About 40,000 of these pictures are preserved, some with the identification cards, and 2,000 of these are on display in the museum... others are at Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust memorial.
Some photographs credited to Brasse are in the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum's permanent exhibit in Block no. 6: Exhibition: The Life of the Prisoners. All visitors to the Museum are asked explicitly to respect the Site of the Death Camp and not to use cameras (both still and video) in its indoor exhibits.
Similar individual "identification photographs" or "mug shots" of prisoners of Auschwitz and other German concentration camps are accessible in the searchable online "Photo Archives" of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). Partially featured on the USHMM official Website is a photograph of the photo mural on a wall of its 3rd floor permanent exhibit. A photograph of an adult female Auschwitz inmate by Wilhelm Brasse is accessible from the USHMM Photo Archives. The USHMM official Website also features similar "identification photographs" credited to the "National Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum" (the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, Poland), but without identifying the photographer (who may or may not be Brasse), as illustrations in "Persecution of Homosexuals in the Third Reich".
Documentary film: "The Portraitist".
This 52-minute Polish documentary film about his life and work, entitled "The Portraitist" ("Portrecista", Poland, 2005), directed by Irek Dobrowolski, and produced by Anna Dobrowolska, was first shown on Polish television station TVP1 on 1 January 2006, in the "Proud to present" series, and it premiered at West London Synagogue, in London, on 19 March 2007, with a second screening by popular demand, on 22 April 2007. In the film Brasse relates the "story behind some pictures in the Auschwitz museum archives that he remembers taking."
As the synopsis for the film emphasizes, after taking thousands of photographs from 1940 until 1945, and, with "courage and skill", documenting "cruelty which goes beyond all words ... for future generations", Brasse "could not continue with his profession..."
Fergal Keane concurs that "Brasse has left us with a powerful legacy in images. Because of them we can see the victims of the Holocaust as human and not statistics. ... The photographs are the work of a man who fought to keep his humanity alive in a place of unimaginable evil."
Work of art based on Brasse's photographs.
Among Brasse's photographs of children concentration-camp prisoners exhibited in the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, in Poland, "identity pictures" of Czesława Kwoka attributed to him inspired a collaborative mixed-media artwork entitled "Painting Czesława Kwoka", by Theresa Edwards (verse) and Lori Schreiner (art), which was displayed at the Windham Art Gallery in Brattleboro, Vermont, from 1 June to 1 July 2007, as part of the exhibition Words & Images: A Collaboration. According to the artists' exhibition catalogue statement, it "brings Czeslawa's image and voice into our lives," thus memorializing Kwoka and all child victims of the Holocaust, as well as others who lost their lives as a result of war. After being featured in the online journal "AdmitTwo", in September 2007, it received the 2007 Tacenda Literary Award for Best Collaboration, from BleakHouse Publishing.

Union Hill, Richmond, Virginia

Union Hill is a local Old and Historic District of Richmond, Virginia. As a neighborhood situated slightly north of the James River, it is located on the high western bluff above Shockoe Valley, just east of Downtown Richmond. The neighborhood is on the National Register of Historic Places.
Description.
Among the many unique qualities exhibited by Union Hill, the fact that it is a complement to its high-style contemporary, Church Hill, is perhaps its strongest. While Church Hill is aligned in accordance with the early tradition of the Richmond grid, Union Hill retains character of geography. It is a neighborhood that displays not only vernacular architecture but also a special sort of vernacular land plan not regularly found in Richmond. Residents understand and appreciate these qualities about Union Hill and the impact that the preservation of this built environment can have upon the morals and character of future generations.
Union Hill comprises a remarkable mix of homes, churches and commercial buildings are balanced along the irregular, picturesque and sometimes narrow streets that follow the curves of the original hilly terrain. Visitors may find a diverse mix of antebellum, Victorian, classical revival and modern architecture. A very small portion of existing buildings are noncontributing to the historic character of the neighborhood. The community takes its name from the joining of two large hills via street grading that began in the late 1800s and continued through the early 1900s. The homes that line Jefferson Park have a clear view of downtown Richmond. Bordered on the south by Jefferson Avenue, on the north by Carrington and O Streets, on the east by 25th Street, and by Mosby on the west. Union Hill's history began early in the nineteenth century.
The Union Hill Historic District was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register in December 2001 and to the National Register of Historic Places in December 2002. On November 23, 2009 Richmond City Council voted 8-1 to designate Union Hill as a City of Richmond Local Old and Historic District.

Prenoun

Prenoun is the term for adjective-like prefixes that attach to nouns in Algonquian languages and the Korean language. 
Algonquian languages.
For example, in Nêhiyawêwin (Plains Cree), the term for "cat" is "minôs", with the addition of the prenoun "wâpiski-" ("white"), the term "wâpiski-minôs" means white-cat , and with the prenoun "misi-" ("big"), it becomes "misi-minôs" with the meaning "big cat". 
Prenouns can also be attached to verbs, in which case they are referred to by the term "preverb" ; "misi-mîcsow", "s/he eats a lot" 
Korean language.
In the Korean language, prenouns are used to modify pronouns, numerals, and nouns. They are different from adjectives in Korean. While adjectives may be conjugated in Korean, prenouns cannot. As well prenouns modify whereas adjectives simply indicate the state of an object.
An example of prenoun usage is in this sentence:
In this sentence the word "delicious" is a prenoun. It is not conjugated and modifies the object of the sentence. Compared with the following sentence:
"Delicious" is conjugated and becomes an adjective. This is used to indicate the current state of the object.

Student Government History.
Student government had its beginning at Bingham High sometime in the 1910s. The first student body president on record was Dewey Miller, who led the miner student body during the 1917/1918 school year. In the 1920s student government at Bingham, like the national government, consisted of three branches, executive, legislative and judicial. The student body officers formed the executive branch with a president, vice president, secretary-treasurer, yell master, yearbook editor and business manager. Representatives from all the classes, the principal, and two faculty members made up the legislative branch. The student body court, with a prosecuting attorney, judge, chief of police and a clerk handled the judicial duties of interpreting the school constitution and maintaining discipline. Over the years the structure of the student government would change, but the lifetime lessons in leadership would be the same.

Brobergen

Brobergen (Low Saxon: "Brobargen") is a village in the German municipality of Kranenburg in the district of Stade, Lower Saxony. The village of 6.06 km² has 220 inhabitants (July 1, 2011). 
The village lies on the right (eastern) bank of the Oste river. The river Mehe, a tributary of the Oste, has its estuary near Brobergen. There is a ferry crossing from the village to the "Hollander Höfe", once the ancestral seat of the noble family von Brobergen, on the left bank of the river. It was a separate municipality until it merged with Kranenburg in 1972.
Geography.
Brobergen lies at the edge of the Marshland along the Oste river. The Mehe river with its outlet close to Brobergen is a leftside tributary of the Oste. The Oste is a tidal river close to sea level. The village itself lies at about 3 meter above sea level on the edge of the Geest. On the border to Oldendorf the elevation rises to about 17,5 m above sea level.
The Deutsche Fährstraße (German Ferry Street) runs through Brobergen. It's a touristic route that connects places showcasing different modes of transportation across water along a 250 km line between Bremervörde and Kiel. In Brobergen the pram ferry is part of this route.
Part of Brobergen are the smaller places Berg, Hollander Höfe and Hüttenberg.
Neighbouring places are Kranenburg in the north, Oldendorf in the east, Estorf in the southeast, Gräpel in the southwest, Ostendorf in Landkreis Rotenburg (Wümme) in the east and Nindorf, Cuxhaven in Landkreis Cuxhaven in the northwest.
History.
The name of the village first occurs in a charter from 1286 and was written "Brocberge" back then. Its name is cognate with the English terms "brook" and "barrow" and indicated a region with small mounts along a stream. This name once referred to a larger area along the Oste between Gräpel and Burweg.
In 1141 a charter from count Rudolf of Stade mentions the three brothers Dudo, Adiko and Ricbert, who founded the Marienkloster in Stade and who also got Brobergen as a fiefdom. At that time the whole region along the Oste river was meant. Only in 1286 a descendant of the three brothers, Otto de Brocberge, and his "borch to brogberghen" (castle in Brobergen) is mentioned. This castle was probably build a few years before 1286. Close to the position of that castle another castle had existed before, but its existence is only known from old documents and no evidence of it has been unearthed so far.
In 1364 a chapel, the Chapel of the Holy Cross, is first mentioned. A charter from 1525 mentions a statue of Roland that existed in Brobergen. This Roland was re-erected in 2007.
The noble family von Brobergen resided on the estate Hollander Höfe until they were forced to sell it in 1618.
Before the Thirty Years' War a drawbridge existed over the Oste river. Tilly's troops destroyed it around 1628 to prevent a Danish attack. Shortly afterwards people began to use prams to reach the farmland across the Oste river.
Ownership over the land changed between several owners, most of them Hamburg merchants until in 1837 local farmers collectively purchased the land they had cultivated since generations.
In the 19th and early 20th century there were many brickyards along the Oste river which made bricks from the marsh clay.
The estate Hollander Höfe existed until 1941 when it was demolished because it was in an out of repair condition. The current house at the estate's site was constructed in 1956 as a living place for the ferry operator and the operator of the Mehe river barrage.
With the local government reorganization in 1972 former municipalities Brobergen and Kranenburg formed a new municipality under the name Kranenburg.
Religion.
Brobergen is traditionally a Lutheran community and part of the Oldendorf parish. The village has its own cemetery and small cemetery chapel at the village exit towards Oldendorf. It's occasionally used for local church services.
Population.
In 1766 there were 17 households in Brobergen. After World War II the population rose by 100 people to 330 inhabitants due to an influx of people expelled in the east. After some years the population number dropped to pre-war levels.
Mayors.
The mayors of Brobergen municipality until being merged with Kranenburg municipality in 1972 were:
Coat of Arms.
The coat of arms of Brobergen is red and silver separated by merlons. The municipality Brobergen bore the coat of arms since 31 March 1948 in succession of the former noble family von Brobergen. Since Brobergen became part of Kranenburg municipality this coat of arms is also part of the coat of arms of Kranenburg municipality.
Street names.
Only with the local government reorganization in 1972 Brobergen first got street names. Before 1972 houses were just numbered. 
Culture.
A pram ferry crosses the Oste river in Brobergen and is part of the Deutsche Fährstraße. At the ferry site there is a small inn called "Fährkrug". The ferry and the inn are used by many bike tourists visiting the region.
Brobergen has an active Schützenverein with a two day Schützenfest each year on the third weekend in July.
Traditions.
Every year on pentecost Maibaums are erected by the youth of the village. On New Year there's a tradition of walking through the village, visiting households and having drinks together while the children collect candy.
Buildings.
War Memorial.
At the village exit towards Oldendorf close to the cemetery is the War Memorial that ommemorates the seven people killed in World War I and the 17 people killed in World War II. It was erected in 1921 on initiative of the veterans' association. The inaugural sermon was held by Oldendorf pastor Hittmeyer and was also attended by Oberstleutnant von Lahnstein from Stade.
The renewed and extended memorial commemorating the fallen of World War II was dedicated on 28 September 1952 with a sermon by pastor Bergens.
Community Center.
The Dorfgemeinschaftshaus with an usable area of 255 m² was constructed between September 1988 and June 1989 close to the shooting range of the Schützenverein behind the former village pub.
Commerce and Infrastructure.
Transportation.
Brobergen is connected with Gräpel and Kranenburg over Kreisstraße 82. This road ends at the Bundesstraße 73 in Burweg which leads to Stade and Cuxhaven and at the Bundesstraße 74 in Elm which leads to Bremervörde. Towards Oldendorf runs Kreisstraße 78 that leads to Himmelpforten again connecting the village to Bundesstraße 73. This is the most important connection to Stade and Hamburg.
The Oste river forms a natural barrier to the west. The ferry can overcome this barrier only in summer and due to bad road connections even in summer most traffic towards the west runs across the Oste bridges in Bremervörde and Hechthausen.
The next train station is in Himmelpforten which is used by commuters to Hamburg.
Economy.
There are some farms and some smaller businesses in Brobergen. The village shop closed in 2002. Most grocery shopping is now done in Oldendorf and Himmelpforten.
There's a wind farm with six plants east of the village.
Media.
The regional newspaper usually read in Brobergen is the Stader Tageblatt.
Education.
A Volksschule in Brobergen was first mentioned in 1797 but likely it already existed before that time. The oldest school records are from 1845. There were 45 pupils then. 1919 this number had risen to 63. Brobergen's school closed on 1 December 1966 and pupils went to school in Gräpel and Estorf. For Realschule and Hauptschule pupils go to Oldendorf. For Gymnasium they attend Vincent-Lübeck-Schule in Stade.
Infrastructure.
There's no central waste water clearing. Each household has its own packaged sewage treatment installation.
People.
Brobergen is the place of residence of the graphic artist Dieter Kalenbach.

Richard Merkin

Richard Merkin (1938 – September 5, 2009) was an American painter and illustrator. Merkin's fascination with the 1920s and 1930s defined his art and shaped his identity as a professional dandy. Merkin traveled back in time as an artist, to the time of the interwar years, creating narrative scenes in bright colors of jazz musicians, film stars, writers, and sports heroes. Merkin was as well-known for his painting and illustration work as he was for his eccentric collecting habits and his outré fashion sense. 
Merkin was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1938, and held an undergraduate degree in fine art from Syracuse University in 1960, a Master's Degree in art from Michigan State University in 1961, and a Master's Degree in Painting (MFA) from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1963. In 1962–63 he received a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Fellowship in Painting and, in 1975, The Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award from The National Institute of Arts and Letters.
Merkin began teaching at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 1963 and remained there for 42 years, during which time he built his reputation in New York. He commuted every week to RISD to teach painting and drawing, after he moved back to New York in 1967. At RISD, Merkin was loved and revered. One RISD alum described him as “fearless beyond measure.” 
Richard Merkin embodied RISD. He lived.
He is represented in the permanent collections of The Museum of Modern Art, The Smithsonian Institution and the Whitney Museum, among others. Merkin had been a contributing editor for "Vanity Fair" since 1986 and a regular contributor of illustrations to "The New Yorker" since 1988, as well as "Harper's" and The "New York Times'" Sunday Magazine. From 1988–1991, he wrote a monthly style column called "Merkin on Style" for "Gentlemen's Quarterly". In 1986, Merkin told The Daily News Record, a fashion publication: "Dressing, like painting, should have a residual stability, plus punctuation and surprise...Somewhere, like in Krazy Kat, you've got to throw the brick." 
In 1995, he illustrated the book "Leagues Apart: The Men and Times of the Negro Baseball Leagues", by Larry Ritter. He wrote the text and captions for "The Tijuana Bibles" (Simon & Schuster, 1997). He appeared on the cover of The Beatles’ "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album, (back row, right of center, in between Fred Astaire and a Vargas Girl). 
Merkin was also an avid collector of vintage pornography, and part of his collection was published in "Velvet Eden - The Richard Merkin Collection of Erotic Photography" (Methuen, 1979). 
Merkin's dear friend, the writer Tom Wolfe wrote in an email to the New York Times upon Merkin's death: "He was the greatest of that breed, the Artist Dandy, since Sargent, Whistler and Dali...Like Dali, he had one of the few remaining Great Mustaches in the art world." Wolfe also wrote: "What made Merkin so sought after as an illustrator was his eccentric approach to modernist art. He used Modernism's all-over flat designs--that is, every square inch of the canvas was covered by flat, unmodulated blocs of color of equal value, creating not three but two dimensions--but his works were full of people, rendered in the same fashion, in comic poses and situations and extravagantly caricatured." 
The New Yorker noted that Merkin “loved and evoked the great spirit of the nineteen-twenties, thirties, and forties in his work” – he was, moreover, “a connoisseur of the good life.” Merkin's career at The New Yorker spanned twenty years, three covers, and nearly three hundred illustrations.
Merkin died on September 5, 2009, after a long illness. He was 70 years old.

Natural resource economics

Natural resource economics deals with the supply, demand, and allocation of the Earth's natural resources. One main objective of natural resource economics is to better understand the role of natural resources in the economy in order to develop more sustainable methods of managing those resources to ensure their availability to future generations. Resource economists study interactions between economic and natural systems, with the goal of developing a sustainable and efficient economy.
Areas of discussion.
Natural resource economics is a transdisciplinary field of academic research within economics that aims to address the connections and interdependence between human economies and natural ecosystems. Its focus is how to operate an economy within the ecological constraints of earth's natural resources. Resource economics brings together and connects different disciplines within the natural and social sciences connected to broad areas of earth science, human economics, and natural ecosystems. Economic models must be adapted to accommodate the special features of natural resource inputs. The traditional curriculum of natural resource economics emphasized fisheries models, forestry models, and minerals extraction models (i.e. fish, trees, and ore). In recent years, however, other resources, notably air, water, the global climate, and "environmental resources" in general have become increasingly important to policy-making.
Academic and policy interest has now moved beyond simply the optimal commercial exploitation of the standard trio of resources to encompass management for other objectives. For example, natural resources more broadly defined have recreational, as well as commercial values. They may also contribute to overall social welfare levels, by their mere existence.
The economics and policy area focuses on the human aspects of environmental problems. Traditional areas of environmental and natural resource economics include welfare theory, pollution control, resource extraction, and non-market valuation, and also resource exhaustibility, sustainability, environmental management, and environmental policy. Research topics could include the environmental impacts of agriculture, transportation and urbanization, land use in poor and industrialized countries, international trade and the environment, climate change, and methodological advances in non-market valuation, to name just a few.
Hotelling's rule is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable resource management by Harold Hotelling. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable economic conditions, lead to a depletion of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or "Hotelling rent" for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the rate of interest, reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resource. Nonaugmentable resources of inorganic materials (i.e. minerals) are uncommon; most resources can be augmented by recycling and by the existence and use of substitutes for the end-use products (see below).
Vogely has stated that the development of a mineral resource occurs in five stages: (1) The current operating margin (rate of production) governed by the proportion of the reserve (resource) already depleted. (2) The intensive development margin governed by the trade-off between the rising necessary investment and quicker realization of revenue. (3) The extensive development margin in which extraction is begun of known but previously uneconomic deposits. (4) The exploration margin in which the search for new deposits (resources) is conducted and the cost per unit extracted is highly uncertain with the cost of failure having to be balanced against finding usable resources (deposits) that have marginal costs of extraction no higher than in the first three stages above. (5) The technology margin which interacts with the first four stages. The Gray-Hotelling (exhaustion) theory is a special case, since it covers only Stages 1–3 and not the far more important Stages 4 and 5.
Simon has stated that the supply of natural resources is infinite (i.e. perpetual) 
These conflicting views will be substantially reconciled by considering resource-related topics in depth in the next section, or at least minimized.
Furthermore, Hartwick's rule provides insight to the sustainability of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable resources.
Perpetual resources vs. exhaustibility.
Background and introduction.
The perpetual resource concept is a complex one because the concept of resource is complex and changes with the advent of new technology (usually more efficient recovery), new needs, and to a lesser degree with new economics (e.g. changes in prices of the material, changes in energy costs, etc.). On the one hand, a material (and its resources) can enter a time of shortage and become a strategic and critical material (an immediate exhaustibility crisis), but on the other hand a material can go out of use, its resource can proceed to being perpetual if it was not before, and then the resource can become a paleoresource when the material goes almost completely out of use (e.g. resources of arrowhead-grade flint). Some of the complexities influencing resources of a material include the extent of recyclability, the availability of suitable substitutes for the material in its end-use products, plus some other less important factors.
The Federal Government suddenly became compellingly interested in resource issues on December 7, 1941, shortly after which Japan cut the U.S. off from tin and rubber and made some other materials very difficult to obtain, such as tungsten. This was the worst case for resource availability, becoming a strategic and critical material. After the war a government stockpile of strategic and critical materials was set up, having around 100 different materials which were purchased for cash or obtained by trading off U.S. agricultural commodities for them. In the longer term, scarcity of tin later led to completely substituting aluminum foil for tin foil and polymer lined steel cans and aseptic packaging substituting for tin electroplated steel cans.
Resources change over time with technology and economics; more efficient recovery leads to a drop in the ore grade needed. The average grade of the copper ore processed has dropped from 4.0% copper in 1900 to 1.63% in 1920, 1.20% in 1940, 0.73% in 1960, 0.47% in 1980, and 0.44% in 2000.
Cobalt had been in an iffy supply status ever since the Belgian Congo (world's only significant source of cobalt) was given a hasty independence in 1960 and the cobalt-producing province seceded as Katanga, followed by several wars and insurgencies, local government removals, railroads destroyed, and nationalizations. This was topped off by an invasion of the province by Katangan rebels in 1978 that disrupted supply and transportation and caused the cobalt price to briefly triple. While the cobalt supply was disrupted and the price shot up, nickel and other substitutes were pressed into service.
Following this, the idea of a "Resource War" by the Soviets became popular. Rather than the chaos that resulted from the Zairean cobalt situation, this would be planned, a strategy designed to destroy economic activity outside the Soviet bloc by the acquisition of vital resources by noneconomic means (military?) outside the Soviet bloc (Third World?), then withholding these minerals from the West.
An important way of getting around a cobalt situation or a "Resource War" situation is to use substitutes for a material in its end-uses. Some criteria for a satisfactory substitute are (1) ready availability domestically in adequate quantities or availability from contiguous nations, or possibly from overseas allies, (2) possessing physical and chemical properties, performance, and longevity comparable to the material of first choice, (3) well-established and known behavior and properties particularly as a component in exotic alloys, and (4) an ability for processing and fabrication with minimal changes in existing technology, capital plant, and processing and fabricating facilities. Some suggested substitutions were alunite for bauxite to make alumina, molybdenum and/or nickel for cobalt, and aluminum alloy automobile radiators for copper alloy automobile radiators. Materials can be eliminated without material substitutes, for example by using discharges of high tension electricity to shape hard objects that were formerly shaped by mineral abrasives, giving superior performance at lower cost, or by using computers/satellites to replace copper wire (land lines).
An important way of replacing a resource is by synthesis, for example, industrial diamonds and many kinds of graphite, although a certain kind of graphite could be almost replaced by a recycled product. Most graphite is synthetic, for example, graphite electrodes, graphite fiber, graphite shapes (machined or unmachined), and graphite powder.
Another way of replacing or extending a resource is by recycling the material desired from scrap or waste. This depends on whether or not the material is dissipated or is available as a no longer usable durable product. Reclamation of the durable product depends on its resistance to chemical and physical breakdown, quantities available, price of availability, and the ease of extraction from the original product. For example, bismuth in stomach medicine is hopelessly scattered (dissipated) and therefore impossible to recover, while bismuth alloys can be easily recovered and recycled. A good example where recycling makes a big difference is the resource availability situation for graphite, where flake graphite can be recovered from a renewable resource called kish, a steelmaking waste created when carbon separates out as graphite within the kish from the molten metal along with slag. After it is cold, the kish can be processed.
Several other kinds of resources need to be introduced. If strategic and critical materials are the worst case for resources, unless mitigated by substitution and/or recycling, one of the best is an abundant resource. An abundant resource is one whose material has so far found little use, such as using high-aluminous clays or anorthosite to produce alumina, and magnesium before it was recovered from seawater. An abundant resource is quite similar to a perpetual resource. The reserve base is the part of an identified resource that has a reasonable potential for becoming economically available at a time beyond when currently proven technology and current economics are in operation. Identified resources are those whose location, grade, quality, and quantity are known or estimated from specific geologic evidence. Reserves are that part of the reserve base that can be economically extracted at the time of determination; reserves should not be used as a surrogate for resources because they are often distorted by taxation or the owning firm's public relations needs.
Comprehensive natural resource models.
Harrison Brown and associates stated that humanity will process lower and lower grade "ore". Iron will come from low-grade iron-bearing material such as raw rock from anywhere in an iron formation, not much different from the input used to make taconite pellets in North America and elsewhere today. As coking coal reserves decline, pig iron and steel production will use non-coke-using processes (i.e. electric steel). The aluminum industry could shift from using bauxite to using anorthosite and clay. Magnesium metal and magnesia consumption (i.e. in refractories), currently obtained from seawater, will increase. Sulfur will be obtained from pyrites, then gypsum or anhydrite. Metals such as copper, zinc, nickel, and lead will be obtained from manganese nodules or the Phosphoria formation (sic!). These changes could occur irregularly in different parts of the world. While Europe and North America might use anorthosite or clay as raw material for aluminum, other parts of the world might use bauxite, and while North America might use taconite, Brazil might use iron ore. New materials will appear (note: they have), the result of technological advances, some acting as substitutes and some with new properties. Recycling will become more common and more efficient (note: it has!). Ultimately, minerals and metals will be obtained by processing "average" rock. Rock, 100 tonnes of "average" igneous rock, will yield eight tonnes of aluminum, five tonnes of iron, and 0.6 tonnes of titanium.
The USGS model based on crustal abundance data and the reserve-abundance relationship of McKelvey, is applied to several metals in the Earth's crust (worldwide) and in the U.S. crust. The potential currently recoverable (present technology, economy) resources that come closest to the McKelvey relationship are those that have been sought for the longest time, such as copper, zinc, lead, silver, gold and molybdenum. Metals that do not follow the McKelvey relationship are ones that are byproducts (of major metals) or haven't been vital to the economy until recently (titanium, aluminum to a lesser degree). Bismuth is an example of a byproduct metal that doesn't follow the relationship very well; the 3% lead reserves in the western U.S. would have only 100 ppm bismuth, clearly too low-grade for a bismuth reserve. The world recoverable resource potential is 2,120 million tonnes for copper, 2,590 million tonnes for nickel, 3,400 million tonnes for zinc, 3,519 BILLION tonnes for aluminum, and 2,035 BILLION tonnes for iron.
Diverse authors have further contributions. Some think the number of substitutes is almost infinite, particularly with the flow of new materials from the chemical industry; identical end products can be made from different materials and starting points. Plastics can be good electrical conductors. Since all materials are 100 times weaker than they theoretically should be, it ought to be possible to eliminate areas of dislocations and greatly strengthen them, enabling lesser quantities to be used. To summarize, "mining" companies will have more and more diverse products, the world economy is moving away from materials towards services, and the population seems to be levelling, all of which implies a lessening of demand growth for materials; much of the materials will be recovered from somewhat uncommon rocks, there will be much more coproducts and byproducts from a given operation, and more trade in minerals and materials.
Trend towards perpetual resources.
As radical new technology impacts the materials and minerals world more and more powerfully, the materials used are more and more likely to have perpetual resources. There are already more and more materials that have perpetual resources and less and less materials that have nonrenewable resources or are strategic and critical materials. Some materials that have perpetual resources such as salt,stone, magnesium, and common clay were mentioned previously. Thanks to new technology, synthetic diamonds were added to the list of perpetual resources, since they can be easily made from a lump of carbon. Another form of carbon, synthetic graphite, is made in large quantities (graphite electrodes, graphite fiber) from carbon precursors such as petroleum coke or a textile fiber. A firm named Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc. is utilizing the removal of dislocations in a material with a technique that overcomes performance limitations caused by inherent weaknesses in the crystal atomic structure. It makes amorphous metal alloys, which retain a random atomic structure when the hot metal solidifies, rather than the crystalline atomic structure (with dislocations) that normally forms when hot metal solidifies. These amorphous alloys have much better performance properties than usual; for example, their zirconium-titanium Liquidmetal alloys are 250% stronger than a standard titanium alloy. The Liquidmetal alloys can supplant many high performance alloys.
Exploration of the ocean bottom in the last fifty years revealed manganese nodules and phosphate nodules in many locations. More recently, polymetallic sulfide deposits have been discovered and polymetallic sulfide "black muds" are being presently deposited from "black smokers" The cobalt scarcity situation of 1978 has a new option now: recover it from manganese nodules. A Korean firm plans to start developing a manganese nodule recovery operation in 2010; the manganese nodules recovered would average 27% to 30% manganese, 1.25% to 1.5% nickel, 1% to 1.4% copper, and 0.2% to 0.25% cobalt (commercial grade) Nautilus Minerals Ltd. is planning to recover commercial grade material averaging 29.9% zinc, 2.3% lead, and 0.5% copper from massive ocean-bottom polymetallic sulfide deposits using an underwater vacuum cleaner-like device that combines some current technologies in a new way. Partnering with Nautilus are Tech Cominco Ltd. and Anglo-American Ltd., world-leading international firms.
There are also other robot mining techniques that could be applied under the ocean. Rio Tinto is using satellite links to allow workers 1500 kilometers away to operate drilling rigs, load cargo, dig out ore and dump it on conveyor belts, and place explosives to subsequently blast rock and earth. The firm can keep workers out of danger this way, and also use fewer workers. Such technology reduces costs and offsets declines in metal content of ore reserves. Thus a variety of minerals and metals are obtainable from unconventional sources with resources available in huge quantities.
Finally, what is a perpetual resource? The ASTM definition for a perpetual resource is "one that is virtually inexhaustible on a human time-scale". Examples given include solar energy, tidal energy, and wind energy, to which should be added salt, stone, magnesium, diamonds, and other materials mentioned above. A study on the biogeophysical aspects of sustainability came up with a rule of prudent practice that a resource stock should last 700 years to achieve sustainability or become a perpetual resource, or for a worse case, 350 years.
If a resource lasting 700 or more years is perpetual, one that lasts 350 to 700 years can be called an abundant resource, and is so defined here. How long the material can be recovered from its resource depends on human need and changes in technology from extraction through the life cycle of the product to final disposal, plus recyclability of the material and availability of satisfactory substitutes. Specifically, this shows that exhaustibility does not occur until these factors weaken and play out: the availability of substitutes, the extent of recycling and its feasibility, more efficient manufacturing of the final consumer product, more durable and longer-lasting consumer products, and even a number of other factors.
The most recent resource information and guidance on the kinds of resources that must be considered is covered on the Resource Guide-Update [http://resourceguide-update.blogspot.com]
Transitioning: perpetual resources to paleoresources.
Perpetual resources can transition to being a paleoresource. A paleoresource is one that has little or no demand for the material extracted from it; an obsolescent material, humans no longer need it. The classic paleoresource is an arrowhead-grade flint resource; no one makes flint arrowheads or spearheads anymore—making a sharpened piece of scrap steel and using it is much simpler. Obsolescent products include tin cans, tin foil, the schoolhouse slate blackboard, and radium in medical technology. Radium has been replaced by much cheaper Cobalt 60 and other radioisotopes in radiation treatment. Noncorroding lead as a cable covering has been replaced by plastics.
Pennsylvania anthracite is another material where the trend towards obsolescence and becoming a paleoresource can be shown statistically. Production of anthracite was 70.4 million tonnes in 1905, 49.8 million tonnes in 1945, 13.5 million tonnes in 1965, 4.3 million tonnes in 1985, and 1.5 million tonnes in 2005. The amount used per person was 84 kg per person in 1905, 7.1 kg in 1965, and 0.8 kg in 2005. [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/coal.html] Compare this to the USGS anthracite reserves of 18.6 billion tonnes and total resources of 79 billion tonnes; the anthracite demand has dropped so much that these resources are more than perpetual.
Since anthracite resources are so far into the perpetual resource range and demand for anthracite has dropped so far, is it possible to see how anthracite might become a paleoresource? Probably by customers continuing to disappear (i.e. convert to other kinds of energy for space heating), the supply network atrophy as anthracite coal dealers can't retain enough business to cover costs and close, and mines with too small a volume to cover costs also close. This is a mutually reinforcing process: customers convert to other forms of cleaner energy that produce less pollution and carbon dioxide, then the coal dealer has to close because of lack of enough sales volume to cover costs. The coal dealer's other customers are then forced to convert unless they can find another nearby coal dealer. Finally the anthracite mine closes because it doesn't have enough sales volume to cover its costs.

National monument

A National monument is a monument constructed in order to commemorate something of national importance such as a war or the country's founding. The term may also refer to a specific monument status, such as a National Heritage Site, which most national monuments are by reason of their cultural importance rather than age. The National monument aims to represent the nation, and serve as a focus for national identity.
Overview.
A series of structures or areas deemed to be of national importance and therefore afforded protection by the state are part of a country's cultural heritage. These national heritage sites are often called something different per country and are listed by national conservation societies.

Wenty Ford

Percival Edmund Wentworth Ford (November 25, 1946 – July 8, 1980) was a Bahamian professional baseball player. Born in Nassau, he was a right-handed pitcher who stood tall and weighed (11 stone 11). Ford's professional career lasted for ten complete seasons (1966–1975), all spent in the Atlanta Braves' organization. He appeared in four Major League Baseball games for the Braves.
The fourth of six Major Leaguers to be born in the Bahamas, Ford played both baseball and cricket as a youth. He signed with the Braves as an undrafted free agent and was promoted to the Major Leagues in September 1973 after his eighth season in the Atlanta farm system, when he won 17 of 24 decisions with an earned run average of 2.46 with the Braves' two top minor league affiliates.
In his Major League debut on September 10, 1973, he started against the San Francisco Giants at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium. Opposing future Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal, Ford threw a complete game, 10–4 triumph, surrendering five hits (four of them singles) and six bases on balls, with three strikeouts. He also cracked two singles in four at bats. Five days later, he appeared in 3⅔ innings pitched in relief against the Cincinnati Reds, allowing only two hits and one earned run, but that run came on a ninth-inning, walk-off home run to Tony Pérez to saddle Ford with a loss. He was ineffective in his next two outings, one each as a reliever and starter, and finished his MLB career with a 1–2 record, with 17 hits and eight bases on balls allowed, with four strikeouts, in 16⅓ innings pitched.
Ford died at age 33 in an automobile accident in his home town of Nassau after apparently falling asleep at the wheel of his car while driving home from work.

Frog Mill Ait

Frog Mill Ait is an island in the River Thames in England between the villages of Medmenham, Buckinghamshire and Hurley, Berkshire. It is situated on the reach above Hurley Lock.
The island is named after a mill on the bank here. Frog Mill Ait and the adjacent Black Boy Island presented a problem to navigation because the towpath was on the other side of the island from the main navigation channel. Hence tow lines had to sweep over the islands, often with the result that barges were pulled onto the shore.
The name "Poisson Deux" is associated with the area, and this is believed to derive from fish ducts or traps in the river here.

Alsace-Lorraine G 8.1

The Alsace-Lorraine Class G 8.1 was a superheated, goods train, steam locomotive with four driving axles, and was based on the Prussian G 8.1. There were no design differences between the two. The Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine ("Reichseisenbahnen in Elsaß-Lothringen") received a total of 137 G 8.1 engines between 1913 and 1919, of which eleven were built by Henschel and the rest by the Grafenstaden. 
After the First World War ten locomotives were left in Germany and were later given the numbers 55 2946, 3338-3340, 4275-4279 and 4285 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. A further one, 55 5665, returned to the Reichsbahn in 1935 along with the G 8.1s from the Saar area. AFter the end of the war, 72 Prussian G 8.1 engines remained in Alsace-Lorraine and went into the fleet of the AL, the successor to the "Reichseisenbahnen". They were joined by a further 138 Prussian G 8.1s handed over as reparations. Several locomotives were passed on to the French Eastern Railway and the Algerian State Railway. The SNCF took over the G 8.1 as Class 040-D. The last G 8.1 in France was number 040-D-260, which was retired in 1966.
The engines were coupled with Prussian class 3 T 16.5 tenders.

USNS Victorious (T-AGOS-19)

USNS "Victorious" (T-AGOS-19) is a "Victorious"-class ocean surveillance ship which was acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1991 and assigned to the Military Sealift Command (MSC) Special Missions Program.
Built in Morgan City, Louisiana.
"Victorious" was built by McDermott Shipyards, Morgan City, Louisiana. She was laid down on 12 April 1988 and launched on 3 May 1988 and was delivered to the U.S. Navy on 13 August 1991.
Special program.
"Victorious" was manned by 19 civilian mariners under the control of the Military Sealift Command (MSC) and staffed with five sponsors.
She is of a small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) design, similar to a catamaran, which provides a stable platform for towing the ship's SURTASS sonar arrays.
Incidents with China.
On March 4, 2009, "Victorious" was involved in one of a string of incidents between US research ships and Chinese ships. While operating in international waters, roughly 120 miles off the coast of mainland China in the Yellow Sea, a Chinese Bureau of Fisheries Patrol vessel used a high-intensity spotlight to illuminate the entire length of "Victorious" several times. The following day, a Chinese Y-12 maritime surveillance aircraft conducted 12 fly-bys of "Victorious" at an altitude of about and a range of 500 yards.
In May 2009, "Victorious" was again harassed by Chinese ships, this time while operating in the Yellow Sea. The Chinese vessels repeatedly approached "Victorious" at as close as 30 yards in heavy fog, at one point stopping in its path, forcing "Victorious" to stop to avoid a collision.

<doc id="19080421" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19080421" title="Salut d'amor">
Salut d'amor

A "salut d'amor" (, or ; "love letter", lit. "greeting") or "(e)pistola" (epistle) was an Occitan lyric poem of the troubadours, written as a letter from one lover to another in the tradition of courtly love. Some songs preserved in the Italian "quattrocento" and "cinquecento" chansonniers are labelled in the rubrics as "saluts" (or some equivalent), but the "salut" is not treated as a genre by medieval Occitan grammarians. The trouvères copied the Occitan song style into Old French as the "salut d'amour". There are a total of nineteen surviving Occitan "saluts" and twelve French ones, with a Catalan examples (of the "salutació amorosa") also. 
The poetic form probably derives from the classical Latin love letter and through a blending of the "ars dictaminis" and the early Occitan "canso". Occitan scholar Pierre Bec argued that the "salut" was tripartite, possessing an introduction, body, and conclusion. Christiane Leube believes that the Latin five-part division of "salutatio", "captatio benevolentiae", "narratio", "petitio", and "conclusio" formed the basis for the "salut", but that the "salutatio" and "captatio" blended into one segment and all but the "conclusio" being less rigidly delineated. Dietmar Rieger regards the "salut" less as a letter than as a variant of the "canso" intended not to be sung in performance but to be read. The Occitan "saluts" do not have stanzas or refrains, but several French ones do ("salut à refrains"). Structurally they are usually octosyllabic rhyming couplets, but a few are hexasyllabic and Raimon de Miraval wrote a heterometric "salut". They often end with a one-word verse, unrhymed with anything previous, that gives the addressee: "Domna" or "Dompna". 
The first "salut d'amor" was probably "Domna, cel qe'us es bos amics", written by Raimbaut d'Aurenga and he served as a model for many later troubadours. Arnaut de Mareuil wrote five "saluts", the most of any individual, and Don Alfred Monson has crowned him the "maître incontesté du salut" ("the uncontested master of the "salut""). They served as a model for Amanieu de Sescars, who wrote two precisely datable "saluts" in 1278 and 1291. Falquet de Romans wrote a "salut d'amor" ("epistola" in the rubric) of 254 lines. The only female author of a "salut" was Azalais d'Altier. Her 101 verses of rhyming couplets were designed to reconcile two lovers and were addressed to a woman, possibly Clara d'Anduza. In French the only named author of a "salut" with refrains is Philippe de Rémi. 
"Destret d'emors mi clam a vos" is a 708-line long anonymous Catalan "salut".

Florida Beer Company

Florida Beer Company is an independent craft brewery located in Melbourne, Florida.
History.
Florida Beer Company is organized in the state of Florida as a C Corporation. Originally founded in 1996 as Indian River Brewing Company, the 11,000 square foot brewery on South US 1 in Melbourne produced its first beers, Indian River Shoal Draft and Indian River Amberjack in June 1997; production of Kelly's Irish Hard Cider and a variety of private label beers began in late 1997-1998. This company was capitalized by a private placement to approximately 65 mostly local shareholders, an SBA-guaranteed loan and original founder contributions.
The Company was recapitalized and reorganized in August 2003 with the addition of the current ownership group as Indian River Beverage Corporation. Indian River Beverage Corporation does business as Florida Beer Company. Florida Beer Company is engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, marketing and sale of alcoholic beverages specifically malt based products (beer). The Company participates in the premium craft beer market.
In March 2005 the company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Ybor City Brewing Company to acquire the brands, marks, intellectual property, inventory and all business assets of Ybor City Brewing Company and the related entities. The assets and brands included Key West (Key West Brewery, originally of Key West, Florida), Ybor Gold (Ybor City Brewing Company originally of Tampa, Florida) and Hurricane Reef (Hurricane Reef Brewery originally of Miami, Florida).
Florida Beer Company is the largest craft brewer in the State of Florida. The State of Florida is the third largest beer market in the country. While Florida ranks among the top for beer consumption in the United States historically the craft segment has lagged versus other parts of the country. In recent years this has changed. The craft market is now out pacing all other segments of the beer industry and the craft market has grown at 22% in Florida versus 11.4% in the rest of country.
During 2008, the Company sold 19 different beers (malt beverages) and two ciders entirely manufactured and packaged at its company-owned brewery in Melbourne, Florida. The Company also engages in contract brewing for a small number of customers. One of these is Original Sin Premium Hard Cider of New York, NY, the other is Kelly's Irish Cider, winner of three gold medals from the North American Brewers Association.
The Company sells its products through a network of wholesale distributors who then sell to bars, restaurants, grocery stores, package stores and other specialty beverage retailers. The Company sells its products predominantly in the state of Florida (80%+), but also markets in New York, Illinois, Georgia, Alabama, Nebraska, Wisconsin, South Carolina and the Caribbean. Florida, which represents the bulk of the Company sales, is a three-tier state governed by a beer franchise law. Florida Statutes Title XXXIV Chapter 563. In many states, specifically Florida, laws affect enforcement of certain terms of the distributor agreements.
The Company maintains two facilities located in Melbourne, Florida, Brevard County. The production brewery is located at 2500 South Harbor City Blvd. This building is approximately and houses all production related activity and equipment, a tasting room with retail store and approximately of office space. The second location, 725 Silver Palm Avenue, is a warehouse located one mile (1.6 km) north of the brewery. There is of office space and of warehouse space in three separate bays. This facility is used for finished goods storage, raw material storage (packaging), excess equipment storage, special package assembly and administrative/sales offices.
It is rumored that the company also produces the "Duff Beer" sold at Universal Studios Orlando theme park's Simpson World.

<doc id="19080447" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19080447" title="Roadstead of Brest">
Roadstead of Brest

The roadstead of Brest ("rade de Brest") is a roadstead or bay located in the Finistère department in Brittany in northwestern France. The surface area is about 180 km² (70 sq mi). The port of Brest is located on its northern edge and one of the two French naval bases. It is linked to the Atlantic Ocean (called the Iroise Sea at this point) by the "Goulet de Brest", a strait about 1.8 km wide. Three main rivers drain into the roadstead: the Penfeld (the first buildings of the naval base were built on
its banks), the Élorn (or river of Landerneau) and the Aulne (or river of Châteaulin).
Strategic importance.
For a number of centuries, Brest has been an important military port. The roadstead of Brest therefore has a number of military installations, for example:
One can also find many remains of old military fortifications and other ruins from past centuries, like the forts at Portzic, at pointe des Espagnols, etc.
Environment.
Thanks to its layout, the roadstead harbours a wide diversity of natural habitats and a high level of biodiversity. It also includes many sites of importance for birds, several networks of habitats and underwater corridors and coastal areas of importance. These areas have been greatly affected by the human activities in the north-west, but have justified the classification of around half of the roadstead as a zone in Natura 2000.
Pollution.
The rich ecology of the roadstead has been diminished by the past exploitation of certain resources, and by the presence of a number of pollutants including heavy metals and tributyltin which were used as biocides in anti-fouling bottom paints. These products are now illegal, but they remain present in sediments and certain organisms. The products which have replaced them for small boats (e.g. Diuron and Irgarol) pose similar problems and have been measured in non-negligible quantities in the roadstead by Ifremer in 2003-2004.
The roadstead is also a victim of the after-effects of war, and in particular the waves of pollution from the First and the Second World Wars. Pollutants trapped in submerged or unexploded munitions are expected to aggravate existing pollution with the first large leaks predicted by experts to occur in the years 2000-2010.

William Wheeler (bishop)

The Rt Rev. William Gordon Wheeler was the 7th Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds from 1966 until 1985.
Life.
Wheeler was born on 5 May 1910 in Saddleworth, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire (now in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham), England, in the United Kingdom. He was educated at the Manchester Grammar School and University College, Oxford. He was strongly influenced by the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the church in Worsley which he attended during his time at the Grammar School. Later he was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1934 and began his ecclesiastical career with curacies at St Bartholomew's, Brighton, and St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield.
During this period, Wheeler became more and more convinced by the writings of the Blessed Cardinal John Henry Newman, once also a minister of the Church of England and the leader of the Oxford Movement, before being received into the Roman Catholic Church. He finally followed this same path and was received into the Catholic Church in 1936. He then enrolled at Beda College in Rome to study for the Catholic priesthood.
Career.
Ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1940, he was firstly an assistant curate at St Edmund's Parish in Lower Edmonton, then chaplain (and later Administrator) at the Westminster Cathedral. He often made a point of noting to his clergy that he understand their difficulties from his having heard confessions every day of the 11 years he served in that office. He was later named by the Holy See to the episcopate as the coadjutor bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Middlesbrough in 1964, immediately after which he participated in the last two sessions of the Second Vatican Council.
Wheeler was named Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds in 1966. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the spirit of the Council. One example is that, immediately after his return from Rome, he founded a new ecumenical centre at Wood Hall in Wetherby, Yorkshire. Later, despite his feelings about the historic structure of the diocese, he followed part of its instruction by supervising the division of his diocese in 1980, in keeping with the Conciliar mandate to have dioceses be of such a size as to be truly manageable under one bishop.
Yet Wheeler remained a staunch conservative in matters of liturgical practice. He was the last bishop in England to use the "cappa magna", and had a strong attachment to the Tridentine Mass.
Wheeler submitted his resignation as bishop of the diocese at the mandatory age of 75 in 1985. He then entered an active retirement.
Death and legacy.
Wheeler died on 21 February 1998, aged 87, after a brief illness. At his request, he was buried near his predecessor and the bishop who had ordained him in the Catholic Church, Bishop Henry John Poskitt, also a convert from the Church of England, in the Church of St. Edward the Confessor in Clifford, West Yorkshire.
A noted author, his memoir, "In Truth and Love", was published posthumously in 1990.
In March 2013, catholic primary and secondary schools in north west Leeds and Bradford, joined together to gain Academy status from the government, as a Catholic Multi Academy Trust. The Trust, the second in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds, took the name The Bishop Wheeler Catholic Academy Trust. At present, 6 schools form the parts of the trust, however there are 10 other catholic schools could join in the future.

<doc id="19080559" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19080559" title="White settlement in Zimbabwe before 1923">
White settlement in Zimbabwe before 1923

White people first came to the region in southern Africa today called Zimbabwe in the 1500s, when Portuguese colonials ventured inland from Mozambique and attacked the Kingdom of Mutapa, which then controlled an area roughly equivalent to eastern Zimbabwe and western Mozambique. Portuguese influence over Mutapa endured for about two centuries before fading away during the 1690s and early 1700s.
During the 1880s and 1890s, the British South Africa Company initiated colonisation by whites, backed by a royal charter from Britain's Queen Victoria: company rule over the country began in 1890, when the Pioneer Column marched to Mashonaland, founded Fort Salisbury and settled in the area.
The company domain was named "Rhodesia" after its founder, Cecil Rhodes, in 1895; the portion south of the Zambezi became officially called Southern Rhodesia in 1898. Concurrently with the expiry of the company's charter in 1923, Southern Rhodesia was granted responsible government by Britain, and became a self-governing colony.
Portuguese and the Rozvi Empire.
In the early 16th century the Portuguese arrived, destroyed Mutapa's trade with Swahili merchants and began a series of wars which left the empire so weakened that it was near collapse in the early 17th century. Several Kalanga communities came together to form the Rozwi Empire, which covered more than half of present day Zimbabwe. By 1690 they forced the Portuguese off the plateau and the Rozwi controlled much of the land formerly under Mwene Mutapa.
With relative peace and prosperity for the next two centuries, the Kalanga centres of Dlo-Dlo, Khami, and Great Zimbabwe reached their peaks. As a result of the mid-19th century turmoil in Transvaal and Natal, the Rozvi Empire came to an end. Ndebele peoples migrating from the Mfecane came to the Kalanga Rozvi Empire and made war with it. They conquered it and assimilated the inhabitants.
British settlement.
The British entered Matabeleland in the 1880s, under the leadership of Cecil Rhodes, who extracted mining rights from King Lobengula of the Ndebele. He sent John Moffat, son of the missionary Robert Moffat, who was trusted by Lobengula, to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain. Moffat persuaded Lobengula to look favourably on Rhodes' proposals carried by his agent Charles Rudd. Rudd assured Lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in Matabeleland, but left this stipulation out of the document which Lobengula signed, the Rudd Concession. It stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations. When Lobengula discovered later what the concession really declared, he tried to renounce it, but the British Government ignored him.
Rhodes used the concession to persuade the British government to grant a royal charter to his British South Africa Company (BSAC) over Matabeleland and its subject states, such as Mashonaland. Through such concessions and treaties, many of which were similarly deceitful, he promoted the colonization of the region's land, labor, and precious metal and mineral resources. In 1895 the BSAC adopted the name 'Rhodesia' for Zambesia and in 1898 'Southern Rhodesia' was officially adopted for the part south of the Zambezi River, which later became Zimbabwe.
The Rudd Concession was a first step towards occupation of good land, but Lobengula's Ndebele were too strong for a direct invasion. Rhodes planned to surround Matebeleland with British-controlled lands, as British Bechuanaland was already established in the west. To the east was Mashonaland, and as the Shona were at the time subjects of Lobengula, they were covered by the Rudd Concession.
In 1890 Rhodes used this fact to justify sending the Pioneer Column of white settlers, protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP), the BSAC's own paramilitary force. Rhodes said they hoped to start a "new Rand" from the ancient gold mines of Mashonaland. The gold had been largely depleted, and the settlers became farmers. Rhodes declared that Lobengula had never really conquered the Shona, so he proclaimed Mashonaland as independent of Matabeland, exploiting tribal rivalries to cement the British settlers' occupation.
Rhodes provoked the neighbouring Ndebele into war, and the BSAP defeated them in the First Matabele War (1893–94). Lobengula won the battle of the Shangani Patrol but he died while fleeing north; with the Ndebele defeat, immigration of more Europeans increased greatly. John Moffat belatedly realised that he had been used by Rhodes and opposed the war. The British government suspected that Rhodes knew that the gold was depleted and that Rhodes' primary aim was to settle Mashonaland and Matabeleland all along. After that and the Jameson Raid on the Transvaal, they did not trust him to the same extent.
Soon after the Jameson Raid, the Ndebele and Shona rose up in rebellion against the encroachment on their native lands by white settlers, a struggle known in Zimbabwe as the First Chimurenga. Europeans called it the Second Matabele War (1896–97). The BSAP defeated them again. The American scout Frederick Russell Burnham killed Mlimo, the Ndebele leader of the rebellion. Soon after Rhodes entered unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the Second Matabele War. The Ndebele and Shona became subject to the Rhodes administration, which led to the land distribution favouring whites and displacing Shona, Ndebele and other Black African people. Land holdings in Zimbabwe continue to be a controversial issue.
Rule by the British South Africa Company and Legislative Council.
From 1894 the colony's executive branch was run by the BSAC's administrator. The Southern Rhodesia Order in Council created a quasi-legislature called the Southern Rhodesia Legislative Council. Elections were held in 1899, 1902, 1905, 1908, 1911, 1914 and 1920.
There was a gradual "de facto" transition from complete rule by the British South Africa Company to self-government by the white settlers. By 1903 the Southern Rhodesia Legislative Council consisted of seven officials of the British South Africa Company and seven elected settlers. In 1907 and later the settlers had the majority of the seats. By the outbreak of the First World War, settlers had formed the Campaign for Responsible Government (later the Responsible Government Association) under Charles Coghlan, who became Rhodesia's first Prime Minister.
In 1918, the BSAC cut back on expenditure and public services such as the mail system, which worsened its popularity among settlers. Agitation continued to grow for self-rule independent of any private corporation. The Legislative Council election of 1920 resulted in a majority who favoured immediate moves towards establishing 'Responsible Government' within the colony. Immediately after the election, the Legislative Council passed a resolution requesting the United Kingdom government to inaugurate responsible government. The UK established a Commission under Earl Buxton, a former Liberal minister. The Commission reported in 1921 that the Colony was ready for responsible government and that a referendum should be held to confirm it. On 27 October 1922 a referendum was held to determine whether the colony should join the Union of South Africa or establish self-government. The self-government camp won the referendum by a wide margin.

Wogan's Perfect Recall

"Wogan's Perfect Recall" was a game show presented by Terry Wogan. It was broadcast on Channel 4 and ran from 25 August 2008 to 19 November 2010.
Format.
Round one is a general knowledge round with 20 questions. The contestant with the fewest points is eliminated. 
In rounds 2 and 3, the questions are different, and usually harder, but the answers remain the same. The contestant with the lowest points is eliminated in each of these rounds. This means contestants can answer either by knowing the answer or by remembering an answer from previous rounds. 
When only one contestant is left they play for up to £100,000. They must choose the number of questions they think they can answer correctly in 60 seconds. If they get fewer, they leave with nothing, whilst if they get more they still only get the amount they have chosen. The minimum number of questions required to answer correctly in order to get any money is 11, whilst the most is 20. 
The show met with criticism due to the format of the final round, as very few contestants actually walked with a cash prize despite setting a low target. However, if the contestant didn't win any money he or she was awarded a consolation prize.

Electoral district of Kwinana

Kwinana is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia.
The district is located in the south-western suburbs of Perth.
History.
Kwinana was first created for the 2008 state election. It was a new urban seat created as a result of the one vote one value reforms. For the most part it combined the southern portion of the district of Cockburn with the northern part of the district of Peel; it also took in territory previously covered by the districts of Rockingham and Serpentine-Jarrahdale.
At its creation, Kwinana was calculated to have a Labor Party majority of 69.2% to 30.8% versus the Liberal Party, making it a very safe Labor seat. However, Labor candidate Roger Cook won the seat only narrowly against independent challenger Carol Adams, prevailing 50.79% to 49.21%. Adams, the mayor of Kwinana, launched her independent candidacy after unsuccessfully contesting Labor preselection for the seat.
Geography.
Kwinana includes all the local government area of the Town of Kwinana as well as a part of the City of Rockingham. The district takes in the suburbs of Naval Base, Hope Valley, Mandogalup, Wandi, Kwinana Beach, Postans, The Spectacles, Anketell, Medina, Orelia, Calista, Kwinana Town Centre, Parmelia, Bertram, Casuarina, Leda, Wellard, Hillman, as well as parts of Cooloongup, Waikiki and Baldivis.

Roy Hay (horticulturist)

Roy Hay MBE (20 August 1910 – 21 October 1989) was a British horticultural journalist and broadcaster. He was the author of many publications and the instigator of many organisations and events, including the annual Britain in Bloom competition.
Early life.
Roy Hay, the son of gardener Thomas Hay, was born in 1910 on the estate of Lord Linlithgow, where his father managed the gardens. In 1911 his father moved the family to Greenwich Park, one of the Royal Parks of London, where Thomas had obtained a post. The family later moved to Regents Park and Hyde Park as Thomas progressed his career, eventually becoming Superintendent of the Royal Parks. In 1924 Roy Hay was taken to the Chelsea Flower Show for the first time, his father having arranged for Roy to miss school "to start his proper education". He attended every show from that point until his death. Roy passed up the opportunity to attend University and instead joined Watkins and Simpson, a wholesale seed company, working on the breeding side and taking pictures for the catalogue. He began to write short pieces to go with these photographs, and with this, his journalism career began.
Journalist and broadcaster.
Having written short pieces for the Watkins and Simpson seed catalogue, Roy began to contribute frequently on horticultural matters. In 1936 he became assistant editor for the "Gardeners' Chronicle" (which became "Horticulture Week") a weekly publication started by Joseph Paxton in 1841. The Chronicle moved to Reading after the outbreak of the Second World War and Roy began to edit for various publications of the Royal Horticultural Society. In 1940 he was recruited by the Ministry of Agriculture and spent two years on their "Dig for Victory" campaign. This campaign was designed to persuade people to cultivate their own gardens and plots in order to combat food shortages. In 1942 he was appointed the horticultural officer to Malta when the Siege of Malta began. In 1945 Roy went on to become controller of horticulture and seeds division for the British zone in occupied Germany.
He returned to the "Gardeners' Chronicle" and in 1956, Hay succeeded the formidable editor Charles H Curtis as its editor, a position he would hold until 1964. In this role he was assisted by Robert Pearson and was known to be a stickler for accuracy.
Roy Hay also presented the BBC radio programme "Home Grown", with Fred Streeter, that occupied the two o'clock slot on Sunday afternoon and was later to be occupied by "Gardener's Question Time". On this show he came into regular contact with the contributor to the programme, Frances Perry whom he married in 1977. They were long standing colleagues and together visited many countries.
Flower shows and Britain in Bloom.
David Bowes-Lyon set up the British Committee for Overseas Flower Shows and made Roy its Secretary, during his time as editor of the "Gardeners' Chronicle". Roy was instrumental in raising the funds in 1955 to set up the British woodland garden at the second Ghent Floralies which won the Grand Prix d'Honneur. Success followed at Paris and in the third Ghent Floralies. The Board of Trade were impressed with this record and offered £10,000 for promotions at the Valenciennes Festival but they were required to give this money to a trade organisation. Roy approached the National Farmers Union and the Horticultural Traders Association, neither of whom were interested. This led to David Bowes-Lyon instructing Roy to set up a brand new organisation. Thus was born the Federation of British Horticultural Exporters which then had seven members, and now has 110 member firms and is now known as Gardenex. Valenciennes was a success.
Whilst on holiday in France in the early 1960s, Roy Hay noticed that the place was "over flowing with plants and flowers". Further investigation revealed that the `Fleurissement de France` was in full swing. This was essentially a "make-France-more-beautiful campaign", initiated by the French Tourist Authority in 1959 on the instructions of General Charles de Gaulle to brighten the country up. On returning to Britain, Hay resolved to emulate this event. He approached the British Tourist Authority (BTA) and along with the Director General of the BTA, Len Lickorish, set up a committee to run the British version with the title "Britain in Bloom". Many organisations were recruited to help, from the AA and RAC to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) and quite soon the event became a phenomenon which has since eclipsed all similar events in Europe in terms of its scale. Despite its later success, Roy Hay did reflect that the initial help from horticultural trade and local authorities in general was lukewarm.
Other influence.
The Gardeners' Sunday Organisation (later to be merged with National Gardens Scheme) was formed in 1956 at the suggestion of Roy Hay.
Honours and awards.
He received a number of honours for his work including the MBE in 1970 and the RHS's Victoria Medal of Honour in 1970, the RHS's highest honour. He was also honoured with the title Officier du Merite Agricole by both Belgium (in 1956) and France (in 1959) for his work in Europe in the years following the war.
Memorial award.
There is a memorial award named after Roy Hay which has been described as much coveted.
Personal life.
Roy Hay married Frances Perry in 1977, a fellow winner of the Victoria Medal of Honour, who survived him after his death in 1989. They were long standing colleagues and together visited many countries.

Early life.
Harry Kingman was born in Tientjin, China, to two western missionaries. In 1899, his father became a chaplain at Pomona College, and Harry eventually attended school there, becoming a star in five sports: baseball, basketball, tennis, track, and swimming. He signed his first major league contract, with the Washington Senators, in June 1914.
Major League Baseball.
Before making his major league debut, Kingman was traded to the New York Yankees. He was originally a first baseman, but manager Frank Chance attempted to convert him into a pitcher. That didn't work out, and Kingman eventually appeared in only one game in the field and three as a pinch hitter during July and August 1914. He went 0 for 3 at the plate with 2 strikeouts and 1 walk. As of 2010, he is the only MLB player to have been born in China.
Later life.
Kingman left baseball after the season was over and got a job in Stiles Hall at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1921 to 1927, he traveled to China and Japan and worked as a missionary, while also playing and coaching baseball. He returned to Berkeley in 1927. For the next 30 years, he worked at Stiles Hall and also coached the university's junior varsity baseball team.
Kingman was married and had one daughter. He died in 1982, at the age of 90, in Oakland, California.

B6 road (Cyprus)

The B6 main road (locally referred as Limassol - Paphos old road, Greek "Παλαιός δρόμος Λεμεσού - Πάφου") used to be the main connecting route between Cyprus's second largest city and major seaport Limassol and Paphos, one of the island's top tourist destinations.
History.
Since the island's capital was moved from Paphos to Nicosia after the Roman times, transportation to Paphos - being a very small town at the time - from the rest of the island was very difficult due to the mountainous geomorphology of the island's Southwestern coast. Until the British colonial times people also used the sea as an alternative to avoid the extremely long dangerous path connecting the two areas. In the early 20th Century the first road was built. It was approximately 80 km long and not more than 3m wide. The B6 runs along the same corridor of the first road. After the Turkish invasion in 1974, and the occupation of the touristic key city of Famagusta the government searched for alternatives to attract tourism to the rest of the island. The need of good road transportation to the whole island was one of the first projects to be done. The road is 60 km long (6 km shorter than the A6 Motorway, a modern 4 lane highway that replaced the B6 as the main connecting route). It runs through 7 villages and the Western Sovereign Base Area.
Current status.
After the completion of the A6 Motorway in 2004 the road is only used by locals, and rarely big traffic volumes occur. It is a very well maintained road and a very interesting drive. A small part of it after the village Pissouri is used by tourists as scenic route, having a bend right next to Petra Tou Romiou, the legendary Aphrodite's birthplace.

Johann Wilhelm Baur

Johann Wilhelm Baur, Joan Guiliam Bouwer, or Bauer (Strasbourg, 31 May 1607 - Vienna, January 1640) was a German engraver, etcher and miniature painter. He is famous for a series of illustrations of Ovid's "Metamorphoses".
Biography.
According to Houbraken, he learned to draw and paint from the miniaturist Friedrich Brentel in Strasbourg, before embarking on a Grand Tour to Rome, where he painted for "Brassiano", a known patron of the arts. He specialized in watercolors of architectural follies in perspective, and for this reason was often employed to make pictures of gardens. He had the habit of talking when he was concentrating, and was known to have conversations with inanimate objects. In 1634 he broke off a trip to Naples to return to a woman in Rome. According to Cornelis de Bie, Baur lived with Carolus Creten while he was in Rome. Creten (Skreta) was a member of the Bentvueghels with the nickname "Slach-sweerd". The RKD has assigned this nickname "Slagzwaard" (longsword) to Baur himself, who was probably also a member of the Bentvueghels, but whose nickname was not recorded by De Bie.
Many of his drawings of Ovid's stories, the passion of Christ in 24 plates, and scenes of daily life in Rome (with costumes of various nationalities) were engraved by Melchior Küsel of Augsburg. He died in Vienna of a sudden illness while on a commission by Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor.

C. Robert Cloninger

Claude Robert Cloninger, M.D. (born April 4, 1944) is a psychiatrist and geneticist noted for his research on the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual foundation of both mental health and mental illness. He holds the Wallace Renard Professorship of Psychiatry, is professor of psychology and genetics, and serves as director of the Sansone Family Center for Well-Being at Washington University in St. Louis. Cloninger is a member of the evolutionary, neuroscience, and statistical genetics programs of the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences at Washington University, and is recognized as an expert clinician in the treatment of general psychopathology, substance dependence, and personality disorders.
Cloninger is known for his research on the genetics, neurobiology, and development of personality and personality disorders. He identified and described heritable personality traits predictive of vulnerability to alcoholism and other mental disorders in prospective studies of adoptees reared apart from their biological parents. Cloninger also carried out the first genome-wide association and linkage study of normal personality traits, and has developed two widely used tools for measuring personality: the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI).
In 2004, he published "Feeling Good: The Science of Well-Being". Cloninger serves as Director of the Anthropedia Institute, the research branch of the Anthropedia Foundation. In collaboration with Anthropedia, he helped develop the "Know Yourself" DVD series.
Cloninger has earned lifetime achievement awards from many academic and medical associations, and is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. He has authored or co-authored nine books and more than four hundred and fifty articles, and is a highly cited psychiatrist and psychologist recognized by the ISI. He has served in an editorial capacity on many journals, including "Behavior Genetics", "American Journal of Human Genetics", "Archives of General Psychiatry", "Comprehensive Psychiatry"., and the Mens Sana Monographs.
Education and early research.
Cloninger was born in Beaumont, Texas in 1944. His father Morris Cloninger was a former English teacher and businessman, and his mother Concetta was a former actress who directed the local community theater. He attended the University of Texas in Austin from 1962-1966 in the Plan II Honors program. In addition to pre-medical studies, he studied philosophy, cultural anthropology, and psychology for which he received honors.
Cloninger attended a research-intensive medical school at Washington University in St. Louis from 1966 to 1970, and has remained on the faculty there throughout his career. In addition to regular medical training, he did a research fellowship in preventive medicine and public health. He began research in psychiatry in 1969 under the guidance of Samuel Guze. Cloninger wanted to understand why antisocial personality disorder, substance dependence, and somatization disorder were so often found together in the same individual and in the same family. This question led to longitudinal studies of people with each of these disorders and then family and adoption studies.
In order to better quantify and test hypotheses about the inheritance of psychiatric disorders, he studied quantitative genetics with Theodore Reich in St. Louis and with Newton Morton and D.C. Rao of the Population Genetics Lab of the University of Hawaii. During the late 70s, Cloninger worked on modeling complex patterns of inheritance using path analysis to allow for both genetic and cultural inheritance. He extended path analysis with the introduction of the "copath" to facilitate the analysis of assortative mating and cultural inheritance. He worked to develop methods for disentangling genetic, cultural, and other environmental influences on mental disorders until he concluded that such statistical modeling would never convince skeptics or provide precise estimates when biological parents also reared their own children. His clinical studies of psychiatric disorders also revealed much complexity in the clinical features of mental disorders: people often had multiple overlapping syndromes and changed over time in unpredictable ways. As a result, he shifted his efforts after 1980 to more compelling experimental designs, such as adoption and linkage studies.
Stockholm Adoption Study.
The answer to the need for better data about separation experiments came in the form of a long-term collaboration between Cloninger and Michael Bohman, the head of child psychiatry at the University of Umea in Sweden. Bohman had read some of Cloninger's papers on the analysis of separation experiments and asked for Cloninger's assistance in his own research. For several years, Bohman had been studying the behavior of a large birth cohort of children born in Stockholm. The children had been separated from their biological parents at birth and reared in adopted homes. Extensive data about alcohol abuse, criminality, and physical and mental complaints to physicians were available in Sweden as a result of the extensive health and social records for all people in the country. Cloninger developed methods for what he called a "cross-fostering" analysis. Information about the genetic background of adoptees was measured by data about their biological parents. Information about their rearing environment was measured by data about their adoptive parents and home environment. This permitted study of the independent contributions of the genetic and environmental backgrounds independently and in combination in a sample of thousands of adoptees. Their first joint paper on a cross-fostering analysis of the inheritance of alcoholism in men became an ISI Science Citation Classic that convinced most scientists that vulnerability to alcoholism was genetically heritable in part.
Cloninger, Bohman, and Soren Sigvardson distinguished two subtypes of alcoholism that differed in their clinical features and pattern of inheritance: type 1, associated with anxiety proneness and loss of control over alcohol intake after age 25; and type 2, associated with impulsivity and antisocial behavior before age 25. Cloninger proposed that the differences between these two groups of people were explained by personality traits that were observable in childhood, long before any exposure to alcohol. He confirmed this by measuring the personality of boys when they were in the fourth grade, about 10 years of age, based on detailed interviews with their teachers and without any knowledge of their drinking status as adults. The personality ratings of Cloninger were based on his tridimensional model of temperament. The personality model also helped the team to understand other findings they obtained about the inheritance of criminal behavior, somatization (i.e., many physical complaints), anxiety, and depressive disorders. The original findings were later confirmed by a replication study using the same methods conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden. Overall, these adoption studies provided strong evidence for the contribution of both genetic and environmental influences on vulnerability to alcoholism, somatization, criminality, anxiety, and depressive disorders.
Temperament and character inventory.
Observations about personality provided Cloninger a practical way to predict vulnerability to mental disorders. In the mid-1980s, he developed a general model of temperament based on genetic, neurobiological, and neuropharmacological data, rather than using factor analysis of behavior or self-reports as has usually been done by personality psychologists. He focused on the structure of learning abilities within the person, as has long been desired by social-cognitive psychologists. To test the adequacy of his structural model, Cloninger compared his model of development within the individual (i.e., ontogeny) to the evolution of learning abilities in animal phylogeny. Initially he described three dimensions of temperament that he suggested were independently inherited: harm avoidance (anxious, pessimistic vs. outgoing, optimistic), novelty seeking (impulsive, quick-tempered vs. rigid, slow-tempered) and reward dependence (warm, approval-seeking vs. cold, aloof). These dimensions are measured by using his Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ).
Studies quickly showed that Persistence (persevering, ambitious vs. easily discouraged, underachieving) was a fourth independently-inherited temperament dimension with specific brain circuitry, rather than a facet of Reward Dependence. These temperament dimensions proved to be a powerful way to distinguish subtypes of personality disorders and vulnerability to a wide range of mental disorders. Cloninger was initially criticized for reducing personality to emotional drives. For example, in his book "Listening to Prozac", Peter Kramer called the temperament model of personality "a humanist's nightmare."
Likewise, Cloninger and his colleague Dragan Svrakic found that temperament alone did not capture the full range of personality. They found that, by itself, temperament could not reveal whether a person was mature or had a personality disorder. On average, there were differences in the probability of personality disorder in people with different temperament configurations, but every configuration could be found in people who were mentally healthy as well as in people who had personality disorders. Consequently, Cloninger identified a second domain of personality variables, using character traits to measure a person's humanistic and transpersonal style: self-directedness (reliable, purposeful vs. blaming, aimless), cooperativeness (tolerant, helpful vs. prejudiced, revengeful) and self-transcendence (self-forgetful, spiritual vs. self-conscious, materialistic). These character dimensions measure the components of an individual's mental self-government and can strongly measure the presence and severity of personality disorder. Cloninger often cites Immanuel Kant, who defines character as "what people make of themselves intentionally." Character dimensions have strong relations with recently evolved regions of the brain—such as the frontal, temporal, and parietal neocortex—that regulate learning of facts and propositions. By contrast, the temperament dimensions have strong relations with the older cortico-striatal and limbic systems that regulate habits and skills.
These three character dimensions have been found to be as heritable as the four temperament dimensions, each with about 50% heritability in twin studies. All seven dimensions of temperament and character have been found to have unique genetic determinants and to be regulated by different brain systems as measured by functional brain imaging. Each dimension is influenced by complex interaction between many genetic and environmental variables, so personality develops as a complex adaptive system. Cloninger's temperament and character inventories have been extensively used in a wide variety of clinical and research purposes, and cited in thousands of peer-reviewed publications. The construction of the inventories on the basis of genetic and neurobiological considerations challenges the traditional statistical assumptions of factor analytically derived inventories, which have been targeted by social and cognitive psychologists for many years. Fortunately, in terms of overall statistical information, there is extensive overlap among the TCI and other multidimensional personality inventories, except that other inventories lack the dimension of Self-Transcendence.
Self-Transcendence & Science of Well-Being.
Self-Transcendence refers to the interest people have in searching for something elevated, something beyond their individual existence. According to Cloninger's model, self-transcendence can manifest as an intuitive understanding of elevated aspects of humanity, like compassion, ethics, art, and culture. Others who experience it may also describe an awareness of a divine presence. People scoring high in TCI Self-Transcendence report frequent experiences of boundlessness and inseparability. They lose awareness of their separateness when absorbed in what they love to do or when appreciating the wonders and mysteries of life. Cloninger observes that such experiences of self-forgetfulness and transpersonal identification correspond to what Freud called "oceanic feelings," which is different from intellectual adherence to particular religious dogmas or rituals. The TCI Self-Transcendence scale is often used as a measure of spirituality. Cloninger proposed that the psyche is the aspect of a human being that motivates the search for self-transcendence and underlies the human capacities for self-awareness, creativity, and freedom of will. As suggested by transpersonal psychologists and other psychiatrists like Carl Jung and Viktor Frankl, Cloninger has emphasized that self-transcendence is an essential component in the processes of integration and maturation of personality. He found that when people who score high on all three character traits are compared to others, they have the highest level of well-being, as measured by presence of positive emotions, absence of negative emotions, satisfaction with life, or virtuous conduct. The capacity for love and work have long been recognized as important for well-being, but Cloninger also observed that people need to experience self-transcendence in order to cope well with suffering and to enjoy life's wonders and mysteries fully.
In his book "Feeling Good: The Science of Well-Being", Cloninger describes the impetus for his new work:
Cloninger has also suggested that not only is there a natural integrative tendency, but that "all human beings have spontaneous needs for happiness, self-understanding and love." He describes practices that improve character development and satisfy these strong basic needs. Just as people can become stronger in the body through physical exercise, he has found they can become mentally and spiritually healthier with mental and spiritual exercises, including certain meditations that enhance mindfulness and spirituality. He describes examples of such exercises in detail in a DVD series called "Know Yourself", which was developed with the Anthropedia Foundation. The "Know Yourself" series is intended for use as well-being coaching or as an adjunct in psychotherapy.
The mental exercises described by Cloninger are intended to stimulate character development and self-awareness, thereby fostering a healthy way of living with three sets of goals and values:
Working in the service of others, thereby increasing love and cooperativeness; letting go of fighting and worrying, thereby increasing hope and self-directedness; and growing in awareness, thereby increasing faith and Self-Transcendence. Cloninger's approach combines principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy, person-centered therapy, and positive psychology with personality assessment and meditative practices that enhance mindfulness and self-awareness of the cognitive schemas that organize and direct our attention and motivation in different situations. His approach differs from other forms of psychotherapy by its emphasis on integration of a person's awareness of their body, thoughts, and psyche. He suggests that the separation of biomedical, psychosocial, and spiritual approaches interferes with the development of well-being, whereas their integration has been shown to reduce drop-out, relapse, and recurrence rates in randomized controlled trials of well-being therapy. Cloninger's integrative approach is intended to synthesize work done in the mental health field, fostering what Juan Mezzich of the World Psychiatric Association has called "psychiatry for the person." Several studies show that psychotherapy, alone or in combination with medications, can help people with mental disorders recover faster and stay well longer, but that a declining number of psychiatrists are providing psychotherapy to their patients. Cloninger is working with the World Psychiatric Association and the International College of Person-centered Medicine to advance a more integrated approach to mental health and well-being. The American Psychiatric Association has recognized Cloninger for his contributions to better understanding the biopsychosocial basis of mental health and illness with its 2009 Judd Marmor Award.

Radar picket duty.
After shakedown off Newport, Rhode Island, "Lookout" was assigned to radar picket duty in the 1st Naval District. From 1956 to 1965 she operated on the Atlantic Ocean perimeter of the radar defense net established around the United States to warn of surprise air attack. On 28 September 1958 her classification was changed to "AGR-2". 
"Lookout’s" periods of 30 to 40 days at sea were alternated with inport replenishment at Davisville, Rhode Island.
By the time she completed her 10th year of service in the spring of 1965, "Lookout" had distinguished herself in the defense of the Nation. 
Decommissioning.
She arrived Bayonne, New Jersey, 23 June and decommissioned there 12 July 1965. Her name was struck from the Naval Register 1 September 1965. "Lookout" was transferred to the Maritime Reserve Fleet and was berthed in the Hudson River, New York, where she remained until she was sold for scrap in 1970 to a scrapping firm in Spain.

The bibliography of the "Coutumes" is large, although it contains mostly articles and only few subject-specific books. The latest edition has been prepared by Amédée Salmon and was published back in 1899-1900, respecting the original old French syntax. It has been no transcription into modern French, but translations exist in English and Japanese.
Authorship.
During a long period of time the author of the text had been falsely identified with "Philippe de Rémi", poet and bailli of the Gâtinais, who was renowned for his 20,000 verses of poems including "La Manekine", "Jehan et Blonde" and "Salut d’amour". As a result, in XIX and at the beginning of 20th century "Philippe" was usually described as a prominent person capable both in poetry and law.
However, it is now a well-established fact that Philip the poet was "Philippe de Beaumanoir"'s father

Overload (Swedish band)

Overload is a heavy metal band from Bollnäs, Sweden. The band was formed by Tony Sunnhag (earlier known as Tony Frisk) and Tony Sandberg back in 1987. They got most of their present sound when Stefan Jonsson joined the band 1992. They have some kind of old style thrash metal sound, with rhythm, harmony and melody as their foundation. Their inspiration comes from life itself, both good and bad things. Their lyrics are not just fantasy, many of their lyrics comes from their dreams. Overload has a sound, influenced by bands like Pantera, Metallica and Judas Priest.
Biography.
Overload recorded their first record 1989. It was produced and engineered by Overload and Bror Törnell at FS Studio in Sweden. This first record didn’t have any name, but it was to be called “Whiskey Drinking Woman” It was released in Jan 1990.
Their second album was recorded and mixed in 1990. Produced and engineered by Overload and Bror Törnell at FS Studio. A single influenced by Harley-Davidson Motorcycles, named “Second Stroke”. It was released in 1991.

Bio-MEMS

Bio-MEMS is an abbreviation for biomedical (or biological) microelectromechanical systems. Bio-MEMS have considerable overlap, and is sometimes considered synonymous, with lab-on-a-chip (LOC) and micro total analysis systems (μTAS). Bio-MEMS is typically more focused on mechanical parts and microfabrication technologies made suitable for biological applications. On the other hand, lab-on-a-chip is concerned with miniaturization and integration of laboratory processes and experiments into single (often microfluidic) chips. In this definition, lab-on-a-chip devices do not strictly have biological applications, although most do or are amendable to be adapted for biological purposes. Similarly, micro total analysis systems may not have biological applications in mind, and are usually dedicated to chemical analysis. A broad definition for bio-MEMS can be used to refer to the science and technology of operating at the microscale for biological and biomedical applications, which may or may not include any electronic or mechanical functions. The interdisciplinary nature of bio-MEMS combines material sciences, clinical sciences, medicine, surgery, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, optical engineering, chemical engineering, and biomedical engineering. Some of its major applications include genomics, proteomics, molecular diagnostics, point-of-care diagnostics, tissue engineering, and implantable microdevices.
History.
In 1967, S. B. Carter reported the use of shadow-evaporated palladium islands for cell attachment. After this first bio-MEMS study, subsequent development in the field was slow for around 20 years. In 1985, Unipath Inc. commercialized ClearBlue, a pregnancy test still used today that can be considered the first microfluidic device containing paper and the first microfluidic product to market. In 1990, Andreas Manz and H. Michael Widmer from Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis), Switzerland first coined the term micro total analysis system (μTAS) in their seminal paper proposing the use of miniaturized total chemical analysis systems for chemical sensing. There have been three major motivating factors behind the concept of μTAS. Firstly, drug discovery in the last decades leading up to the 1990s had been limited due to the time and cost of running many chromatographic analyses in parallel on macroscopic equipment. Secondly, the Human Genome Project (HGP), which started in October 1990, created demand for improvements in DNA sequencing capacity. Capillary electrophoresis thus became a focus for chemical and DNA separation. Thirdly, DARPA of the US Department of Defense supported a series of microfluidic research programs in the 1990s after realizing there was a need to develop field-deployable microsystems for the detection of chemical and biological agents that were potential military and terrorist threats. Researchers started to use photolithography equipment for microfabrication of microeletromechanical systems (MEMS) as inherited from the microelectronics industry. At the time, the application of MEMS to biology was limited because this technology was optimized for silicon or glass wafers and used solvent-based photoresists that were not compatible with biological material. In 1993, George M. Whitesides, a Harvard chemist, introduced inexpensive PDMS-based microfabrication and this revolutionized the bio-MEMS field. Since then, the field of bio-MEMS has exploded. Selected major technical achievements during bio-MEMS development of the 1990s include:
Today, hydrogels such as agarose, biocompatible photoresists, and self-assembly are key areas of research in improving bio-MEMS as replacements or complements to PDMS.
Approaches.
Materials.
Silicon and glass.
Conventional micromachining techniques such as wet etching, dry etching, deep reactive ion etching, sputtering, anodic bonding, and fusion bonding have been used in bio-MEMS to make flow channels, flow sensors, chemical detectors, separation capillaries, mixers, filters, pumps and valves. However, there are some drawbacks to using silicon-based devices in biomedical applications such as their high cost and bioincompatibility. Due to being single-use only, larger than their MEMS counterparts, and the requirement of clean room facilities, high material and processing costs make silicon-based bio-MEMS less economically attractive. In vivo, silicon-based bio-MEMS can be readily functionalized to minimize protein adsorption, but the brittleness of silicon remains a major issue.
Plastics and polymers.
Using plastics and polymers in bio-MEMS is attractive because they can be easily fabricated, compatible with micromachining and rapid prototyping methods, as well as have low cost. Many polymers are also optically transparent and can be integrated into systems that use optical detection techniques such as fluorescence, UV/Vis absorbance, or Raman method. Moreover, many polymers are biologically compatible, chemically inert to solvents, and electrically insulating for applications where strong electrical fields are necessary such as electrophoretic separation. Surface chemistry of polymers can also be modified for specific applications. The most common polymers used in bio-MEMS include PMMA, PDMS, and SU-8.

B) and C) Single fibroblasts are spatially constrained to the geometry of the fibronectin micropattern.]]
Biological materials.
Microscale manipulation and patterning of biological materials such as proteins, cells and tissues have been used in the development of cell-based arrays, microarrays, microfabrication based tissue engineering, and artificial organs. Biological micropatterning can be used for high-throughput single cell analysis, precise control of cellular microenvironment, as well as controlled integration of cells into appropriate multi-cellular architectures to recapitulate "in vivo" conditions. Photolithography, microcontact printing, selective microfluidic delivery, and self-assembled monolayers are some methods used to pattern biological molecules onto surfaces. Cell micropatterning can be done using microcontact patterning of extracellular matrix proteins, cellular electrophoresis, optical tweezer arrays, dielectrophoresis, and electrochemically active surfaces.
Paper.
Paper microfluidics (sometimes called lab on paper) is the use of paper substrates in microfabrication to manipulate fluid flow for different applications. Paper microfluidics have been applied in paper electrophoresis and immunoassays, the most notable being the commercialized pregnancy test, ClearBlue. Advantages of using paper for microfluidics and electrophoresis in bio-MEMS include its low cost, biodegradability, and natural wicking action. Compared to traditional microfluidic channels, paper microchannels are accessible for sample introduction (especially forensic-style samples such as body fluids and soil), as well as its natural filtering properties that exclude cell debris, dirt, and other impurities in samples. Techniques for micropatterning paper include photolithography, laser cutting, ink jet printing, plasma treatment, and wax patterning.
Electrokinetics.
Electrokinetics have been exploited in bio-MEMS for separating mixtures of molecules and cells using electrical fields. In electrophoresis, a charged species in a liquid moves under the influence of an applied electric field. Electrophoresis has been used to fractionate small ions, charged organic molecules, proteins, and DNA. Electrophoresis and microfluidics are highly synergistic because it is possible to use higher voltages in microchannels due to faster heat removal. Isoelectric focusing is the separation of proteins, organelles, and cells with different isoelectric points. Isoelectric focusing requires a pH gradient (usually generated with electrodes) perpendicular to the flow direction. Sorting and focusing of the species of interest is achieved because an electrophoretic force causes perpendicular migration until it flows along its respective isoelectric points. Dielectrophoresis is the motion of uncharged particles due to induced polarization from nonuniform electric fields. Dielectrophoresis can be used in bio-MEMS for dielectrophoresis traps, concentrating specific particles at specific points on surfaces, and diverting particles from one flow stream to another for dynamic concentration.
Microfluidics.
Microfluidics refers to systems that manipulate small (10−9 – 10−18 L) amounts of fluids on microfabricated substrates. Microfluidic approaches to bio-MEMS confer several advantages:
An interesting approach combining electrokinetic phenomena and microfluidics is digital microfluidics. In digital microfluidics, a substrate surface is micropatterned with electrodes and selectively activated. Manipulation of small fluid droplets occurs via electrowetting, which is the phenomenon where an electric field changes the wettability of an electrolyte droplet on a surface.
Bio-MEMS as Miniaturized Biosensors.
Biosensors are devices that consist of a biological recognition system, called the bioreceptor, and a transducer. The interaction of the analyte with the bioreceptor causes an effect that the transducer can convert into a measurement, such as an electrical signal. The most common bioreceptors used in biosensing are based on antibody–antigen interactions, nucleic acid interactions, enzymatic interactions, cellular interactions, and interactions using biomimetic materials. Common transducer techniques include mechanical detection, electrical detection, and optical detection.
Micromechanical sensors.
Mechanical detection in bio-MEMS is achieved through micro- and nano-scale cantilevers for stress sensing and mass sensing, or micro- and nano-scale plates or membranes. In stress sensing, the biochemical reaction is performed selectively on one side of the cantilever to cause a change in surface free energy. This results in bending of the cantilever that is measurable either optically (laser reflection into a quadposition detector) or electrically (piezo-resistor at the fixed edge of the cantilever) due to a change in surface stress. In mass sensing, the cantilever vibrates at its resonant frequency as measured electrically or optically. When a biochemical reaction takes place and is captured on the cantilever, the mass of the cantilever changes, as does the resonant frequency. Mass sensing is not as effective in fluids because the minimum detectable mass is much higher in damped mediums, something that is overcome with plates or membranes. The advantage of using cantilever sensors is that there is no need for an optically detectable label on the analyte or bioreceptors.
Electrical and electrochemical sensors.
Electrical and electrochemical detection are easily adapted for portability and miniaturization, especially in comparison to optical detection. In amperometric biosensors, an enzyme-catalyzed redox reaction causes a redox electron current that is measured by a working electrode. Amperometric biosensors have been used in bio-MEMS for detection of glucose, galactose, lactose, urea, and cholesterol, as well as for applications in gas detection and DNA hybridization. In potentiometric biosensors, measurements of electric potential at one electrode are made in reference to another electrode. Examples of potentiometric biosensors include ion-sensitive field effect transistors (ISFET), Chemical field-effect transistors (chem-FET), and light-addressable potentiometric sensors (LAPS). In conductometric biosensors, changes in electrical impedance between two electrodes are measured as a result of a biomolecular reaction. Conductive measurements are simple and easy to use because there is no need for a specific reference electrode, and have been used to detect biochemicals, toxins, nucleic acids, and bacterial cells.
Optical sensors.
A challenge in optical detection is the need for integrating detectors and photodiodes in a miniaturized portable format on the bio-MEMS. Optical detection includes fluorescence-based techniques, chemiluminescence-based techniques, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Fluorescence-based optical techniques use markers that emit light at specific wavelengths and the presence or enhancement/reduction (e.g. fluorescence resonance energy transfer) in optical signal indicates a reaction has occurred. Fluorescence-based detection has been used in microarrays and PCR on a chip devices. Chemiluminescence is light generation by energy release from a chemical reaction. Bioluminescence and electrochemiluminescence are subtypes of chemiluminescence. Surface plasmon resonance sensors can be thin-film refractometers or gratings that measure the resonance behaviour of surface plasmon on metal or dielectric surfaces. The resonance changes when biomolecules are captured or adsorbed on the sensor surface and depends on the concentration of the analyte as well as its properties. Surface plasmon resonance has been used in food quality and safety analysis, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.
Bio-MEMS for diagnostics.
Genomic and proteomic microarrays.
The goals of genomic and proteomic microarrays are to make high-throughput genome analysis faster and cheaper, as well as identify activated genes and their sequences. There are many different types of biological entities used in microarrays, but in general the microarray consists of an ordered collection of microspots each containing a single defined molecular species that interacts with the analyte for simultaneous testing of thousands of parameters in a single experiment. Some applications of genomic and proteomic microarrays are neonatal screening, identifying disease risk, and predicting therapy efficacy for personalized medicine.
Oligonucleotide chips.
Oligonucleotide chips are microarrays of oligonucleotides. They can be used for detection of mutations and expression monitoring, and gene discovery and mapping. The main methods for creating an oligonucleotide microarray are by gel pads (Motorola), microelectrodes (Nanogen), photolithography (Affymetrix), and inkjet technology (Agilent).
cDNA microarray.
cDNA microarrays are often used for large-scale screening and expression studies. In cDNA microarrays, mRNA from cells are collected and converted into cDNA by reverse transcription. Subsequently, cDNA molecules (each corresponding to one gene) are immobilized as ~100 µm diameter spots on a membrane, glass, or silicon chip by metallic pins. For detection, fluorescently-labelled single strand cDNA from cells hybridize to the molecules on the microarray and a differential comparison between a treated sample (labelled red, for example) and an untreated sample (labelled in another color such as green) is used for analysis. Red dots mean that the corresponding gene was expressed at a higher level in the treated sample. Conversely, green dots mean that the corresponding gene was expressed at a higher level in the untreated sample. Yellow dots, as a result of the overlap between red and green dots, mean that the corresponding gene was expressed at relatively the same level in both samples, whereas dark spots indicate no or negligible expression in either sample.
Peptide and protein microarrays.
The motivation for using peptide and protein microarrays is firstly because mRNA transcripts often correlate poorly with the actual amount of protein synthesized. Secondly, DNA microarrays cannot identify post-translational modification of proteins, which directly influences protein function. Thirdly, some bodily fluids such as urine lack mRNA. A protein microarray consists of a protein library immobilized on a substrate chip, usually glass, silicon, polystyrene, PVDF, or nitrocellulose. In general, there are three types of protein microarrays: functional, analytical or capture, and reverse-phase protein arrays.
Protein microarrays have stringent production, storage, and experimental conditions due to the low stability and necessity of considering the native folding on the immobilized proteins. Peptides, on the other hand, are more chemically resistant and can retain partial aspects of protein function. As such, peptide microarrays have been used to complement protein microarrays in proteomics research and diagnostics. Protein microarrays usually use "Escherichia coli" to produce proteins of interest; whereas peptide microarrays use the SPOT technique (stepwise synthesis of peptides on cellulose) or photolithography to make peptides.
PCR chips.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a fundamental molecular biology technique that enables the selective amplification of DNA sequences, which is useful for expanded use of rare samples e.g.: stem cells, biopsies, circulating tumor cells. The reaction involves thermal cycling of the DNA sequence and DNA polymerase through three different temperatures. Heating up and cooling down in conventional PCR devices are time-consuming and typical PCR reactions can take hours to complete. Other drawbacks of conventional PCR is the high consumption of expensive reagents, preference for amplifying short fragments, and the production of short chimeric molecules. PCR chips serves to miniaturize PCR into microfluidic bio-MEMS and can achieve rapid heat transfer and fast mixing due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio and short diffusion distances respectively. The advantages of PCR chips include shorter thermal-cycling time, more uniform temperatures during the PCR process for enhanced yield, and portability for point-of-care applications. Two challenges in microfluidic PCR chips are PCR inhibition and contamination due to the large surface-to-volume ratio increasing surface-reagent interactions. For example, silicon substrates have good thermal conductivity for rapid heating and cooling, but can poison the polymerase reaction. There are stationary (chamber-based), dynamic (continuous flow-based), and microdroplet (digital PCR) chip architectures.
Point-of-care-diagnostic devices.
The ability to perform medical diagnosis at the bedside or at the point-of-care is important in health care, especially in developing countries where access to centralized hospitals is limited and prohibitively expensive. To this end, point-of-care diagnostic bio-MEMS have been developed to take saliva, blood, or urine samples and in an integrated approach perform sample preconditioning, sample fractionation, signal amplification, analyte detection, data analysis, and result display. In particular, blood is a very common biological sample because it cycles through the body every few minutes and its contents can indicate many aspects of health.
Sample conditioning.
In blood analysis, white blood cells, platelets, bacteria, and plasma must be separated. Sieves, weirs, inertial confinement, and flow diversion devices are some approaches used in preparing blood plasma for cell-free analysis. Sieves can be microfabricated with high-aspect-ratio columns or posts, but are only suitable for low loading to avoid clogging with cells. Weirs are shallow mesa-like sections used to restrict flow to narrow slots between layers without posts. One advantage of using weirs is that the absence of posts allows more effective recycling of retenate for flow across the filter to wash off clogged cells. The H-filter is a microfluidic device with two inlets and two outlets that takes advantage of laminar flow and diffusion to separate components that diffuse across the interface between two inlet streams. By controlling the flow rate, diffusion distance, and residence time of the fluid in the filter, cells are excluded from the filtrate by virtue of their slower diffusion rate. The H-filter does not clog and can run indefinitely, but analytes are diluted by a factor of two. For cell analysis, cells can be studied intact or after lysis. A lytic buffer stream can be introduced alongside a stream containing cells and by diffusion induces lysis prior to further analysis. Cell analysis is typically done by flow cytometry and can be implemented into microfluidics with lower fluid velocities and lower throughput than their conventional macroscopic counterparts.
Sample fractionation.
Microfluidic sample separation can be achieved by capillary electrophoresis or continuous-flow separation. In capillary electrophoresis, a long thin tube separates analytes by voltage as they migrate by electro-osmotic flow. For continuous-flow separation, the general idea is to apply a field at an angle to the flow direction to deflect the sample flow path toward different channels. Examples of continuous-flow separation techniques include continuous-flow electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, continuous-flow magnetic separations, and molecular sieving.
Bio-MEMS in tissue engineering.
Cell culture.
Conventional cell culture technology is unable to efficiently allow combinatorial testing of drug candidates, growth factors, neuropeptides, genes, and retroviruses in cell culture medium. Due to the need for cells to be fed periodically with fresh medium and passaged, even testing a few conditions requires a large number of cells and supplies, expensive and bulky incubators, large fluid volumes (~0.1 – 2 mL per sample), and tedious human labour. The requirement of human labour also limits the number and length between time points for experiments. Microfluidic cell cultures are potentially a vast improvement because they can be automated, as well as yield lower overall cost, higher throughput, and more quantitative descriptions of single-cell behaviour variability. By including gas exchange and temperature control systems on chip, microfluidic cell culturing can eliminate the need for incubators and tissue culture hoods. However, this type of continuous microfluidic cell culture operation presents its own unique challenges as well. Flow control is important when seeding cells into microchannels because flow needs to be stopped after the initial injection of cell suspension for cells to attach or become trapped in microwells, dielectrophoretic traps, micromagnetic traps, or hydrodynamic traps. Subsequently, flow needs to be resumed in a way that does not produce large forces that shear the cells off the substrate. Dispensing fluids by manual or robotic pipetting can be replaced with micropumps and microvalves, where fluid metering is straightforward to determine as opposed to continuous flow systems by micromixers. A fully automated microfluidic cell culture system has been developed to study osteogenic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. A handheld microfluidic cell culture incubator capable of heating and pumping cell culture solutions has also been developed. Due to the volume reduction in microfluidic cultures, the collected concentrations are higher for better signal-to-noise ratio measurements, but collection and detection is correspondingly more difficult. "In situ" microscopy assays with microfluidic cell cultures may help in this regard, but have inherently lower throughput due to the microscope probe having only a small field of view. Micropatterned co-cultures have also contributed to bio-MEMS for tissue engineering to recapitulate "in vivo" conditions and 3D natural structure. Specifically, hepatocytes have been patterned to co-culture at specific cell densities with fibroblasts to maintain liver-specific functions such as albumin secretion, urea synthesis, and p450 detoxification. Similarly, integrating microfluidics with micropatterned co-cultures has enabled modelling of organs where multiple vascularized tissues interface, such as the blood–brain barrier and the lungs. Organ-level lung functions have been reconstituted on lung-on-a-chip devices where a porous membrane and the seeded epithelial cell layer are cyclically stretched by applied vacuum on adjacent microchannels to mimic inhalation.
Stem-cell engineering.
The goal of stem cell engineering is to be able to control the differentiation and self-renewal of pluripotency stem cells for cell therapy. Differentiation in stem cells is dependent on many factors, including soluble and biochemical factors, fluid shear stress, cell-ECM interactions, cell-cell interactions, as well as embryoid body formation and organization. Bio-MEMS have been used to research how to optimize the culture and growth conditions of stem cells by controlling these factors. Assaying stem cells and their differentiated progeny is done with microarrays for studying how transcription factors and miRNAs determine cell fate, how epigenetic modifications between stem cells and their daughter cells affect phenotypes, as well as measuring and sorting stem cells by their protein expression.
Biochemical factors.
Microfluidics can leverage its microscopic volume and laminar flow characteristics for spatiotemporal control of biochemical factors delivered to stem cells. Microfluidic gradient generators have been used to study dose-response relationships. Oxygen is an important biochemical factor to consider in differentiation via hypoxia-induced transcription factors (HIFs) and related signaling pathways, most notably in the development of blood, vasculature, placental, and bone tissues. Conventional methods of studying oxygen effects relied on setting the entire incubator at a particular oxygen concentration, which limited analysis to pair-wise comparisons between normoxic and hypoxic conditions instead of the desired concentration-dependent characterization. Developed solutions include the use of continuous axial oxygen gradients and arrays of microfluidic cell culture chambers separated by thin PDMS membranes to gas-filled microchannels.
Fluid shear stress.
Fluid shear stress is relevant in the stem cell differentiation of cardiovascular lineages as well as late embryogenesis and organogenesis such as left-right asymmetry during development. Macro-scale studies do not allow quantitative analysis of shear stress to differentiation because they are performed using parallel-plate flow chambers or rotating cone apparatuses in on-off scenarios only. Poiseuille flow in microfluidics allows shear stresses to be varied systematically using channel geometry and flow rate via micropumps, as demonstrated by using arrays of perfusion chambers for mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblast cell adhesion studies.
Cell–ECM interactions.
Cell-ECM interactions induce changes in differentiation and self-renewal by the stiffness of the substrate via mechanotransduction, and different integrins interacting with ECM molecules. Micropatterning of ECM proteins by micro-contact printing (μCP), inkjet printing, and mask spraying have been used in stem cell-ECM interaction studies. It has been found by using micro-contact printing to control cell attachment area that that switch in osteogenic / adipogenic lineage in human mesenchymal stem cells can be cell shape dependent. Microfabrication of microposts and measurement of their deflection can determine traction forces exerted on cells. Photolithography can also be used to cross-link cell-seeded photo-polymerizable ECM for three-dimensional studies. Using ECM microarrays to optimize combinatorial effects of collagen, laminin, and fibronectin on stem cells is more advantageous than conventional well plates due to its higher throughput and lower requirement of expensive reagents.
Cell–cell interactions.
Cell fate is regulated by both interactions between stem cells and interactions between stem cells and membrane proteins. Manipulating cell seeding density is a common biological technique in controlling cell–cell interactions, but controlling local density is difficult and it is often difficult to decouple effects between soluble signals in the medium and physical cell–cell interactions. Micropatterning of cell adhesion proteins can be used in defining the spatial positions of different cells on a substrate to study human ESC proliferation. Seeding stem cells into PDMS microwells and flipping them onto a substrate or another cell layer is a method of achieving precise spatial control. Gap junction communications has also been studied using microfluidics whereby negative pressure generated by fluid flow in side channels flanking a central channel traps pairs of cells that are in direct contact or separated by a small gap. However, in general, the non-zero motility and short cell cycle time of stem cells often disrupt the spatial organization imposed by these microtechnologies.
Embryoid body formation and organization.
Embryoid bodies are a common "in vitro" pluripotency test for stem cells and their size needs to be controlled to induce directed differentiation to specific lineages. High throughput formation of uniform sized embryoid bodies with microwells and microfluidics allows easy retrieval and more importantly, scale up for clinical contexts. Actively controlling embryoid body cell organization and architecture can also direct stem cell differentiation using microfluidic gradients of endoderm-, mesoderm- and ectoderm-inducing factors, as well as self-renewal factors.
Assisted reproductive technologies.
Assisted reproductive technologies help to treat infertility and genetically improve livestock. However, the efficiency of these technologies in cryopreservation and the "in vitro" production of mammalian embryos is low. Microfluidics have been applied in these technologies to better mimic the "in vivo" microenvironment with patterned topographic and biochemical surfaces for controlled spatiotemporal cell adhesion, as well as minimization of dead volumes. Micropumps and microvalves can automate tedious fluid-dispensing procedures and various sensors can be integrated for real-time quality control. Bio-MEMS devices have been developed to evaluate sperm motility, perform sperm selection, as well as prevent polyspermy in in-vitro fertilization.
Bio-MEMS in medical implants and surgery.
Implantable microelectrodes.
The goal of implantable microelectrodes is to interface with the body’s nervous system for recording and sending bioelectrical signals to study disease, improve prostheses, and monitor clinical parameters. Microfabrication has led to the development of Michigan probes and the Utah electrode array, which have increased electrodes per unit volume, while addressing problems of thick substrates causing damage during implantation and triggering foreign-body reaction and electrode encapsulation via silicon and metals in the electrodes. Michigan probes have been used in large-scale recordings and network analysis of neuronal assemblies
, and the Utah electrode array has been used as a brain–computer interface for the paralyzed. Extracellular microelectrodes have been patterned onto an inflatable helix-shaped plastic in cochlear implants to improve deeper insertion and better electrode-tissue contact for transduction of high-fidelity sounds. Integrating microelectronics onto thin, flexible substrates has led to the development of a cardiac patch that adheres to the curvilinear surface of the heart by surface tension alone for measuring cardiac electrophysiology, and electronic tattoos for measuring skin temperature and bioelectricity.
Microtools for surgery.
Bio-MEMS for surgical applications can improve existing functionality, add new capabilities for surgeons to develop new techniques and procedures, and improve surgical outcomes by lowering risk and providing real-time feedback during the operation. Micromachined surgical tools such as tiny forceps, microneedle arrays and tissue debriders have been made possible by metal and ceramic layer-by-layer microfabrication techniques for minimally invasive surgery and robotic surgery. Incorporation of sensors onto surgical tools also allows tactile feedback for the surgeon, identification of tissue type via strain and density during cutting operations, and diagnostic catheterization to measure blood flows, pressures, temperatures, oxygen content, and chemical concentrations.
Drug delivery.
Microneedles, formulation systems, and implantable systems are bio-MEMS applicable to drug delivery. Microneedles of approximately 100μm can penetrate the skin barrier and deliver drugs to the underlying cells and interstitial fluid with reduced tissue damage, reduced pain, and no bleeding. Microneedles can also be integrated with microfluidics for automated drug loading or multiplexing. From the user standpoint, microneedles can be incorporated into a patch format for self-administration, and do not constitute a sharp waste biohazard (if the material is polymeric). Drug delivery by microneedles include coating the surface with therapeutic agents, loading drugs into porous or hollow microneedles, or fabricating the microneedles with drug and coating matrix for maximum drug loading. Microneedles for interstitial fluid extraction, blood extraction, and gene delivery are also being developed. The efficiency of microneedle drug delivery remains a challenge because it is difficult to ascertain if the microneedles effectively penetrated the skin. Some drugs, such as diazepam, are poorly soluble and need to be aerosolized immediately prior to intranasal administration. Bio-MEMS technology using piezoelectric transducers to liquid reservoirs can be used in these circumstances to generate narrow size distribution of aerosols for better drug delivery. Implantable drug delivery systems have also been developed to administer therapeutic agents that have poor bioavailability or require localized release and exposure at a target site. Examples include a PDMS microfluidic device implanted under the conjunctiva for drug delivery to the eye to treat ocular diseases and microchips with gold-capped drug reservoirs for osteoporosis. 
In implantable bio-MEMS for drug delivery, it is important to consider device rupture and dose dumping, fibrous encapsulation of the device, and device explantation. Most drugs also need to be delivered in relatively large quantities (milliliters or even greater), which makes implantable bio-MEMS drug delivery challenging due to their limited drug-holding capacity.

Recurring guest cast:
Character Analysis.
Ramesh Majhu
Ramesh is a middle-aged shopkeeper, born in India but a long-term resident of the Glasgow suburb of Lenzie. He has been the proprietor of the local convenience store Fags, Mags & Bags for over 30 years. In the episode 'Evil Narbara' from series four, Ramesh reveals that he opened the store on the same day the Double Decker chocolate bar was launched. This would place the opening of Fags, Mags & Bags to 1976. 
Ramesh pursues his chosen career in low-return retail with a near religious zeal, possessing an encyclopaedic knowledge of product lines and a deft line in banter, seeing his shop as a microcosm of life. Twenty years hard "shop" has earned Ramesh a tan Mercedes and a pair of mushroom-coloured tasselled loafers.
Despite a ceaseless quest for the secondary purchase, and organising a fictional festival solely to boost sales, Ramesh seems to genuinely have his customers' interests at heart. He is popular with fellow shopkeepers; chairing the local Traders' Association, and also won the coveted 'Shopkeeper of the Year Award' in the Small-to-Medium Retail Concern category in Series 2. 
Ramesh is a widower, having married his wife in an arranged marriage during the 1960s.
It is revealed that he has no sense of smell, and is a fan of the TV show Lost. Ramesh also experimented with a perm at one point in homage to the tennis star John McEnroe.
Dave Legg
Dave is Ramesh's best friend and assistant at Fags, Mags & Bags. An amiable man in his forties, he has worked for Ramesh for many years and shares his enthusiasm for all things "shop" and the music of Barbara Dickson.
Despite his easy-going nature, Dave is periodically beset by anxieties about his job and status; suffering a full scale breakdown, brought on by Ramesh's mother-in-law. It was also revealed early on that despite his skill in the art of shopkeeping, he is unable to mind the store on his own; for reasons as yet undisclosed. He appears to be a widower, like Ramesh, as he made a reference to his wife's death certificate in the series 4 episode "Foam Wizards". He seems to have had children, as he mentions receiving Father's Day gifts in "The Festival of Maltodextrin", but they never hinted at again. Dave briefly dated a pet psychologist named Kate during the second series.
Dave has a talent for creating compound words, and also attempted to popularise the catchphrase Five Alive with limited success.
Alok Majhu
Ramesh's elder son sees himself as a forward thinking entrepreneur and tends to conduct conversations in marketing jargon. Alok views his father's low-return empire with disdain and is engaged in an ongoing and futile attempt to drag his father's shop upmarket. 
Alok has a vastly over inflated sense of his abilities as a businessman and his ventures such as the Lembit Opik Pita Heater invariably meet with disaster. This was particularly apparent in the episode "The Wrath Of Khan" when Alok's decision to install a Slush Machine lead to a full scale retail war with the cafe at the Lenzie Leisuredome. 
This unwillingness to master the day to day realities of running a suburban confectioners causes Ramesh amusement and despair in equal measure, he is unwilling to leave Alok in charge of the shop for the weekend whilst he goes away on a murder mystery weekend. 
Sanjay Majhu
Ramesh's youngest son is in his late teens and shares his brother's disdain for the world of low-return retail. However unlike Alok this is due to teenage apathy and general surliness rather than a desire to pursue a high flying business career. Sanjay litters his conversation with SMS language and contemporary slang and treats customers with scarcely disguised indifference.
Despite this, Sanjay displays some flair for shopkeeping in "The De-Magowaning of Ramesh" where he successfully sells several secondary purchases. Sanjay also manages to show an aptitude for tabloid style reporting during work experience at a local newspaper, but with characteristic lack of tact manages to alienate Ramesh's customers and fellow shopkeepers by printing scurrilous stories about them. 
Sanjay also briefly sported a moustache much to the amusement of Ramesh and Dave.

George Galatis

George Galatis was a senior nuclear engineer and whistleblower who reported safety problems at the Millstone 1 Nuclear Power Plant, relating to reactor refueling procedures, in 1996. The unsafe procedures meant that spent fuel rod pools at Unit 1 had the potential to boil, possibly releasing radioactive steam throughout the plant.
Every 18 months the Millstone 1 nuclear reactor was shut down so the fuel rods that make up its core could be replaced; the old rods, radioactive and burning hot, were moved into a 40-feet-deep body of water called the spent-fuel pool. One-third of the rods were moved into the pool under normal conditions. But in the 1990s Galatis realized that Millstone was routinely performing "full-core off-loads," moving all the hot fuel into the spent-fuel pool. In addition, the Millstone 1 routine ignored the mandated 250 hour cool-down period before a full core off-load, and sometimes the fuel was moved just 65 hours after shutdown, a violation that melted the boots of one worker. By sidestepping the safety requirements in this way, Millstone saved about two weeks of downtime for each reactor refueling—during which Northeast Utilities had to pay $500,000 a day for replacement power.
Galatis eventually took his concerns to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to find that they had "known about the unsafe procedures for years". As a result of going to the NRC, Galatis experienced "subtle forms of harassment, retaliation, and intimidation". 
The NRC Office of Inspector General investigated this episode and essentially agreed with Galatis in Case Number 95-771, the report of which tells the whole story: 
The Office of Inspector General (OIG), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), initiated this investigation based on information submitted to the NRC pursuant to a 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 2.206 petition filed on August 21, 1995, on behalf of George Galatis, a senior engineer with Northeast Utilities Services Company (NU), and We the People, Inc. The petition alleged that the NRC knowingly allowed NU to operate the Millstone Unit 1 Nuclear Power Station for 20 years in violation of its operating license and beyond its design basis. The petitioners maintained that during normal refueling outages at Millstone Unit 1, NU offloaded the entire fuel core.
The OIG investigation developed evidence that NU operated Millstone Unit 1 outside of its design basis. The OIG investigation determined that the licensee may have violated the operating license for Millstone Unit 1 because of a failure to operate in accordance with its technical specification. One procedure required by the technical specifications is for the operation of the spent fuel cooling system. OIG uncovered information which indicates that for approximately 10 years, in order to handle the heat load from a full core offload, reactor operators at Millstone Unit 1
operated the spent fuel pool cooling system in a configuration that was not covered by a plant operating procedure.
Galatis was the subject of a Time magazine cover story on March 4, 1996. Millstone 1 was permanently closed in July 1998.

Poetto

Poetto is Cagliari's main beach. It stretches for about eight kilometers, from Sella del Diavolo (the Devil's Saddle) up to the coastline of Quartu Sant'Elena. Poetto is also the name of the district located on the western stretch of the strip between the beach and Saline di Molentargius (Molentargius's Salt Mine).
Etymology.
The name of the beach supposedly derives from an Aragon Tower named "Poet's Tower", which is still visible above the Sella del Diavolo (Devil's Saddle). Another hypothesis is that the name 'Poetto' is linked to the Catalan "pohuet" (small well), referring to the numerous wells and tanks scattered on the Sella del Diavolo for the storage of rainwater.
History.
Until 1900 Poetto beach was not very popular with Cagliaritans who instead preferred the west side of the gulf, with the beaches of "Sa Perdixedda" (in Sardinian "small stone") and Giorgino. It was during the first decades of the 20th century that people began to appreciate the white dunes of Poetto and that the first seaside resorts ( "Lido" and "D'Aquila"), bars and even a Hospital (Ospedale Marino) was built. A number of "casotti" (coloured wooden constructions halfway between a dressing room and a tiny house on the seashore) were built, imitating the first Lido's "cabine" (Dressing rooms). The casotti, however, were entirely removed in 1986 for sanitation reasons. Due to their removal, the overcrowding, and a lack of erosion prevention work, there was gradual dispersal of sand and a fast erosion of the shoreline in the nineties.
To avoid the disappearance of the beach a rainbowing was tried on the Cagliari side in 2002: the sand was reclaimed and sprayed onto the beach using a fleet of dredging ships a few miles from the shore, in an attempt to restore the beach to its original size. However, the result was not as successful as expected: the white, fine-grained sand was replaced by sand of a completely different color, size and consistency. Years later the situation has not improved, and the quartese stretch, which initially remained intact after a few years, has now begun to have the same problems due to the removal of sand by the wind, people and, of course, the sea. 
Administrative division.
Poetto is popularly divided into "fermate" (stops), which means the various stretches of beach are recognized by the ordinal number of bus stops or urban lines linking the city centre district. The most popular is the 1st stop, adjacent to the port of Marina Piccola. Very famous and popular are the 2nd (D'Aquila), 3rd (Lido) 4th and the 6th, home of major events (Championships of Beach Volleyball, Beach soccer, Beach Football and concerts). Around the 10th stop the coastline belonging to the Comune of Quartu Sant'Elena begins.
Nightlife.
Poetto is also the entertainment district for Cagliari's nightlife and attracts many tourists. Especially from June to September, one can listen to live music, go to discos, participate in dance lessons or karaoke or simply walk on the seashore.

McKidd, like the rest of the cast, did his own singing in the Gilbert & Sullivan operettas portrayed in the film.
In 2001 he played Elliot in the British film "Understanding Jane", directed by Caleb Lindsay. He appeared in Ridley Scott's "Kingdom of Heaven", and in the 2002 film adaptation of "Nicholas Nickleby". In Neil Marshall's horror film, "Dog Soldiers", he appeared as Pvt. Lawrence Cooper.

In 2012, he voiced the characters of Lord MacGuffin and his son Young MacGuffin in the Disney/Pixar film "Brave". Having grown up in Elgin, McKidd used a variation of the Doric accent for Young MacGuffin, and one of the running gags of his lines is that not even Lord MacGuffin is entirely sure what he is saying.
Speyside Sessions.

Arn – The Kingdom at Road's End

"Arn – The Kingdom at Road's End" () is a 2008 epic film based on Jan Guillou's trilogy about the fictional Swedish Knights Templar Arn Magnusson. It is the sequel to the 2007 film "Arn – The Knight Templar", but both films were combined into a single cut for the English release on DVD in 2010.
Filmed in Scotland, Sweden, Syria,Damascus and Morocco.
Plot.
The plot of the film loosely follows the book of the same name – the third volume of the "Crusades" trilogy, spanning the period of about 1187 to 1205.
Arn is the commander of a Templar garrison in Gaza. He is commanded to join a Templar force intercepting the army of Saladin. Due to the arrogance of the new Templar Grandmaster Gerard de Ridefort, the Crusaders are destroyed in the ensuing Battle of Hattin. Arn is wounded but Saladin recognizes him and saves Arn from execution. Arn wakes in Damascus, his wounds treated; Saladin sends him home with his friendship as he prepares to take Jerusalem.
Cecilia is finally allowed to leave the monastery where she has done penance for twenty years, meeting her son Magnus for the first time. She soon hears of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Templars and believing Arn dead decides to become a nun for the rest of her life, being offered the post of Abbess by the Folkung clan. Arn meets her as she is just about to enter the convent, and they marry at last, building an estate, Forsvik, where Arn has gathered craftsmen from all over Europe and the Holy Land. Arn is introduced to his son Magnus, born in his absence; after a little time a daughter named Alde is born, and Forsvik grows rapidly. Arn takes young men and boys to become knights-in-training.
Six years later King Canute I of Sweden dies, leaving children as heirs. King Sverker II retakes the crown with Danish help and attempts to murder the sons of Canute, prevented by the intercession of a Folkung who has tricked Sverker into thinking he was a double agent. Forced to war, the first of what is to be a nearly 600-year long conflict between Sweden and Denmark, Arn leads the Folkungs against the Sverker-Danish force at the Battle of Lena, aided by Arabic craftsmen and the Norwegian templar Harald. Arn destroys the Danish cavalry tricking them to charge into a rain of arrows. Arn charges forward on horseback to attack King Sverker, and is intercepted by Ebbe Suneson, the leader of the Danes; in the ensuing duel Arn kills him, taking a fatal wound in the exchange. The Folkung emerge victorious, but Arn dies of his wound upon his return to Forsvik. The film concludes with an epilogue foreshadowing the completion of the consolidation of Sweden into a unified kingdom a generation later through Birger Jarl, identified as Arn's grandson.
Language.
To clarify the cultural differences, different languages in dialogue: Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, English, and Arabic.
English used to symbolize the Latin and French.
The part of the dialogue that is not on the Swedish subtitled in Swedish.
Music.
Music composed by Tuomas Kantelinen. Closing song by Marie Fredriksson, the lead singer for Roxette.

Land council

Land councils, also known as land and sea councils, are Australian community organisations organised by region that represent the Indigenous Australians who occupied that region before the arrival of European settlers. They have historically advocated for recognition of traditional land rights, and also for the rights of Indigenous people in other areas such as equal wages and adequate housing.
Most Land Councils provide representation and organization of native title for Indigenous Australians, and receive funding from the Australian Commonwealth Government to do this work. Most land councils were formed since the late 1970s to gain native title, and most propositions for land councils have been put forth to the state governments since the 1990s, particularly after the downfall of the terra nullius legal precedent in Mabo v. Queensland (1993).
Some land councils can be governed by other, larger councils, which federate multiple local land councils for representation at the state and federal level.

The Wilbraham

The Wilbraham at 282-284 Fifth Avenue or 1 West 30th Street, in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, was built in 1888-90 as a bachelor apartment hotel. Its "bachelor flats" each consisted of a bedroom and parlor, with bathroom but no kitchen; the communal dining room was on the eighth floor. The building's refined and "extraordinarily well detailed" design in commercial Romanesque revival style – which owed much to the Richardsonian Romanesque developed by H.H. Richardson – was the work of the partners David and John Jardine. The "Real Estate Record and Guide" in 1890 called it "quite an imposing piece of architecture". 
The building is eight stories under a verdigris copper-covered mansard roof, with penthouses and basements, as a result of changes made during its construction. It is clad in Philadelphia brick and brownstone from quarries in Belleville, New Jersey, with wrought- and cast iron. Steel replaced structural cast iron after the foundations were already in place.
The building was commissioned as a real estate investment by the prominent Scottish-American jeweler William Moir. At the time the brownstone-fronted houses along this stretch of Fifth Avenue were being sold by the rich, who were rebuilding, often in more palatial fashion, farther north, in the part of Fifth Avenue that overlooked Central Park, just coming into its first maturity. Still, the neighborhood remained fashionable for clubs, hotels and the first blocks of "French flats". The fashionable purveyors of china and glass Davis Collamore & Co. leased two floors of showrooms.
In 1934-35 the Wilbraham's apartments were remodeled to include kitchens, a mark of changed social habits and gas cooking. It remains in residential use.
In 2004 the Wilbraham was designated a New York City Landmark.

Hubert Latham

Arthur Charles Hubert Latham (10 January 1883 – 25 June 1912) was a French aviation pioneer. He was the first person to attempt to cross the English Channel in an aeroplane. Due to engine failure during his first of two attempts to cross the Channel, he became the first person to land an aeroplane on a body of water.
Early life.
Latham was born in Paris into a wealthy Protestant family. His French mother's family were the bankers, "Mallet Frères et Cie", and his father, Lionel Latham, was the son of an English merchant adventurer and trader of indigo and other commodities, Charles Latham, who had settled in Le Havre in 1829. Hubert Latham’s English grand-uncles were mercantile traders, merchant bankers and lawyers in the City of London and Liverpool and his home was the centuries old Château de Maillebois, near Chartres, which his father purchased from Vicomte de Maleyssie in 1882. One of Latham's maternal grand-aunts was the mother of the German Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, (appointed in 1909), which made him a second cousin of the aviator.
Latham had two siblings, an older sister, Edmée, and a younger sister, Léonie. The three children were raised within the small but elite circle of Protestant high society. All three children spoke French, English and German fluently. His father, Lionel, died of pneumonia in 1885 and his mother never remarried.
Latham attended Balliol College at the University of Oxford for one academic year 1903/4 after which he fulfilled his reservist military service training obligation in Paris and then accompanied his cousin, the balloonist Jacques Faure, on a night crossing of the English Channel (from London to Paris) in a gas balloon on 11–12 February 1905. He also competed successfully in an Antoinette motor yacht in the power boat racing events at the Monaco Regatta, April 1905, in association with his cousin Jules Gastambide and Léon Levavasseur, the inventor of the Antoinette engine. He then led an exploratory expedition with friends to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1906/07 during which he collected specimens for the Natural History Museum in Paris and performed survey work for the French Colonial Office. In 1908, his travels continued on to the Far East, before returning to France later that year.
Aviation career.
Association with Antoinette aircraft.
Latham returned from the Far East in time to take the opportunity of witnessing several of the performances by Wilbur Wright, who was in France trying to sell his aeroplane to the French Government, in his "Flyer" at Camp d'Auvours, near Le Mans. Intrigued with the idea of flying, Latham searched for an aeroplane company that would train him as a pilot. He selected the Antoinette company headed by Jules Gastambide, a distant cousin, and Léon Levavasseur, co-director, designer, and chief engineer, whom Latham knew from Monaco, since it was Levavasseur who designed the boats Latham raced as well as built their engines which became the precursors of his aeroplane motors. The Antoinette company (named after Gastambide's daughter) had been founded in 1906 to build and sell Levavasseur's engines. The favourable power-to-weight ratio of the engines made them attractive to other early aeroplane builders, including Gabriel Voisin, Louis Blériot, Alberto Santos-Dumont, and Henry Farman, who used them for their own aeroplanes. In 1907 the company decided to build its own aeroplanes and after several unsuccessful attempts at designing an airworthy model the first "Antoinette" monoplane was finally introduced in late 1908.
Latham joined the firm in February 1909, and was taught to fly by the company's pilots, Eugène Welféringer and René Demanest. It took several weeks for Latham to master the complicated controls, but Levavasseur recognized his potential and did not dismiss him. Once Latham became proficient, for the next two years he competed at aviation meets throughout Europe and the United States, setting records and winning prizes. His performances earned him fame on both sides of the Atlantic. While many other pilots flew the "Antoinette" competitively, either for the company or privately, none mastered the aircraft as well as Latham.
Latham's cousin, René Labouchere, was responsible for the development of "Antoinette" engines, and in spring of 1909 became the first passenger that Hubert Latham carried for 200 meters, 5 meters above ground at Mourmelon le Grand.
Flying school.
In early 1909, the Antoinette company worked with the French Army at Camp Châlons near Mourmelon-le-Grand to establish the first military aircraft trials, a flight school and a workshop. The school, run by Levavasseur's brother-in-law Charles Wachter, included the Antoinette Trainer - a rudimentary flight simulator that comprised a half-barrel mounted on a universal joint, with flight controls, pulleys, and stub-wings (poles) to allow the pilot to maintain balance while instructors applied external forces.
Within months of both learning to fly and developing his flying technique, Latham became the school's principal instructor. On 17 August 1909 he was awarded Aviator's Certificate number 9 by the Aéro-Club de France. His pupils in 1909 included Marie Marvingt, who became the first woman to fly combat missions as a bomber pilot and established air ambulance services throughout the world, and Infante Alfonso, Duke of Galliera, cousin of King Alfonso XIII of Spain and the first Spanish military pilot.
Attempts to win "Daily Mail" Channel-crossing prize.
In May 1909, three months after Latham joined the company, he at last realized his potential and flew for 37.5 minutes at a speed of 45 mph at a height of just over . A week later he set the European non-stop flight record at 1 hour and 7 minutes which seriously challenged the Wrights' world record. During this flight he took his hands off the steering wheel, took a cigarette out of his silver case and smoked it in his ivory holder, thus creating a new record. This delighted Levavasseur because it showcased the aeroplane's stability when being flown with hands off the controls. Then on June 6, 1909, Latham won the "Prix Ambroise Goupy" for flying a straight-line course of six kilometers in 4 minutes, 13 seconds. These flights convinced Levavasseur that Latham was clearly his best pilot and he was named the company's premier pilot. Furthermore, based on the length of the flights Latham was conducting, Levavasseur was satisfied that his "Antoinette IV" monoplane was sufficiently reliable for a 45 minute-to-1 hour continuous flight and therefore Latham could attempt to fly across the English Channel to win a £1,000 (US$5,000 1910) prize offered by the "Daily Mail".
On 9 July 1909, while encamped at Sangatte, several miles west of Calais on the French coast of the English Channel, Latham officially informed the "Daily Mail" that he intended to cross the Channel by air and claim their prize. He was forced to renew his intention several times as his attempt was continually delayed by bad weather. Within the next four days, Comte Charles de Lambert, a Franco-Russian aviator, also notified the "Daily Mail" of his intention to compete for the prize and he established his camp at Wissant, several miles west of Sangatte, bringing two French-built Wright "Flyers (Nos. 2 and 18) with him.
On 19 July Latham took off from Cap Blanc-Nez, very near Sangatte, but after only his Antoinette IV suffered engine failure and Latham had to ditch in the Channel, thereby performing the world's first landing of an aircraft on the sea. The undamaged fuselage remained afloat, so he lit a cigarette and awaited rescue by the French torpedo-destroyer "Harpon" that was following. After recovery of the aircraft, the engine was examined and a stray piece of wire was found inside the engine. Levavasseur stated that the misfire was caused by this wire.
In his 1958 book "Flying Witness" Graham Wallace recounts that, when surrounded by the crowd that greeted Latham on the Calais quayside on 19 July, Levavasseur was asked by the "Daily Mail"’s reporter Harry Harper if the failure had caused him to be discouraged. The answer was:
Because the salvage operation on Latham's first "Antoinette" resulted in severe damage to the aircraft, Levavasseur was forced to arrange for a second plane to be shipped from the factory in Puteaux, a Paris suburb, and it arrived on July 21. It was their newest model, the "Antoinette VII", and it had never been tested in flight, although Latham did get a chance to fly it once, briefly, while he waited for the foul weather to abate.
A day later, Louis Blériot set up camp just under away from Latham at Les Baraques and announced his intention to go for the prize in his Blériot XI monoplane, and the two contestants had to wait for better weather. Meanwhile, de Lambert damaged one of his "Flyers" in a test flight shortly after Blériot's arrival and decided to withdraw from the competition.
At about 3 a.m. the morning of 25 July 1909 Blériot's team noticed a break in the weather, awakened him, prepared the aircraft, and waited for dawn to make the attempt if the favourable conditions still held. Levavasseur and the rest of Latham's team, however, slept the night through and failed to notice the opportunity, a lapse which was rigorously criticised by Latham’s supporters. Blériot took off precisely at dawn (4.41am) to make the first successful crossing of the English Channel by aeroplane.
Harry Harper, the "Daily Mail" reporter who was witness to the event, wrote that Levavasseur woke up just in time to see Blériot's aeroplane leaving the French coast and he rushed to wake Latham and his crew to see if it could be possible to catch Blériot or overtake him should the latter not succeed in crossing the Channel. By the time Latham's monoplane was in position atop the cliffs at Cap Blanc-Nez, a gusty wind had risen, accompanied by heavy rains, so that "any attempt at a take-off would have been nothing less than suicidal."
Two days later, on 27 July, Latham made a second attempt to cross the Channel. He was within minutes of arriving in the vicinity of Dover when engine failure again forced him into the sea. This time he could not control the angle of descent as well as he had in his first attempt and when he hit the water he seriously damaged the aircraft and suffered severe lacerations to his forehead. Although no definitive cause of engine failure for this second attempt was found, two possibilities were put forward. One is that the innovative fuel-injection system became clogged due to unfiltered fuel. Aviation pioneer Gabriel Voisin, who used "Antoinette" engines in his own planes, posited another possibility which he argued was also the cause of Latham's first failure: ""The "Antoinette" V-8 furnished a significant fraction less of its power after running more than 15 minutes. It was this problem that provoked Latham's fall into the sea.""
Latham wanted to make yet another attempt but as British pioneer aviator Claude Grahame-White wrote:
Further aviation career.
Latham participated in twelve other competitions throughout Europe and, in late 1910 and early 1911, four in the United States: New York, site of the second Gordon Bennett International Gold Cup race, where Latham was a member of the French team (it was the first flight in a competition of the "Antoinette VII" equipped with a V-16 100 hp motor.); Baltimore, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
At the "Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne" on 22–29 August 1909 at Reims, France, (the first true international aviation competition that drew almost 100,000 spectators on opening day. Latham came in second for the speed competition and was first in the altitude contest, flying an "Antoinette IV", setting a world record of . He also competed in the "Grand Prix" event, trying to fly the longest distance around the circuit in a single uninterrupted flight, making several attempts in two different aircraft over the three-days. He won prizes for second place in one aircraft ("Antoinette IV") and fifth in the other ("Antoinette VII" ).
Latham competed as a member of the French team in the first "Coupe Internationale d'Aviation", popularly known as the Gordon Bennett Cup since its inauguration as a hot air balloon contest years earlier, which was also held during the first "Reims Week". Piloting the "Antoinette VII" he placed third with Glenn Curtiss, the only American entrant at the competition, earning first prize and Louis Blériot coming in second.
One of Latham's more spectacular exhibition flights took place in Blackpool, England, on 22 October 1909, where he flew in a gale. The signal was given that the wind was over the limit of 15 mph, but Latham took off and covered in 11 minutes in winds ranging between 23 mph and 40 mph.
When he flew downwind he later estimated that his airspeed reached 100 mph during the flight. When he flew directly into the wind, however, one of the stronger gusts he encountered drove him backwards. This was reported as the first time people ever saw an aeroplane fly in reverse. According to one local historian, the incident came about to fulfill his promise to fly given to the Tsar’s cousin and his wife with whom he had dined the previous night. Newspaper reporters dubbed him ‘King of the Air’, in a similar way that the soubriquet ‘The Storm King’, had been created by the press after his encounters with stiff winds at Reims.
On 7 January 1910, in Mourmelon-le-Grand, France, Latham climbed to an altitude of , more than higher than his previous world record and beyond previous claims of unofficial records. Later the same year, in July during the second "Semaine de l'Aviation de la Champagne" at Reims, Latham again set a world altitude record of .
In Los Angeles in December 1910, while Latham was participating in an aviation meet, he was asked by one of the wealthier citizens of the city if he would consider coming to his estate to try and shoot wild duck in the air from his aeroplane. Latham agreed and shot two with a borrowed shotgun and thus became the first person to hunt wild fowl from an aeroplane. Again, Levavasseur had reason to be pleased over yet another demonstration of his aircraft's stability. Latham had one of the ducks stuffed and it is still displayed at the "Château de Maillebois".
In Los Angeles, Latham had a serious crash attributed to wind gusts. He misjudged the strength of the wind while trying to land, which resulted in his being driven into a hillside. The "Los Angeles Times" ran the following headline about the incident:
Latham survived another crash in early 1911 when he gave a demonstration flight at the Brooklands automobile racing course in England. Harry Harper described the incident:
By the autumn of 1911, Levavasseur had completed building an aeroplane known as the "Monobloc" or "Antoinette blindé" (Fr. 'armoured') that was engineered and designed in accordance with the French Ministry of War's requirements. It was entered in the military trials staged at Reims in October 1911 to compete with 10 other entries from as many companies. Levavasseur insisted that Latham would be the pilot. Unfortunately, in the rush to have his aeroplane built in time to enter the trials, Levavasseur never had the chance to test it. The result was that the aeroplane failed to get airborne despite two attempts by Latham because Levavasseur did not have a powerful enough motor that could cope with the significant weight of the aircraft. The "Monobloc's" failure and subsequent loss of a potentially lucrative government contract was the final blow to the Antoinette company which folded the next month.
Death.
At the end of December 1911, Latham left France to undertake an expedition to the French Congo. Following recent wars to retain their control over this part of Africa, this region continued to be a virtual war zone administered by the French Colonial military authorities. A number of air-fields were being planned for the Sahara to the north of the Congo and there was speculation at the time that Latham may have been asked to undertake an assessment of conditions in the interior region for the French Colonial Office. One aviation journalist suggested that he was to be ‘acting on their behalf in a matter that is not disclosed’. Latham did not ship an aircraft but instead brought an out-board engine for a canoe.
Although an experienced and expert hunter of wild game, his death is officially reported to have been caused by being mauled by a wounded buffalo. However, in one anonymous contemporary newspaper article which appeared in 1914, it was claimed that the adjutant-commandant of a French Colonial Army fort located just outside Fort Archambault, who retrieved his body after his death, had found that Latham had sustained a single head wound and saw no marks on or around Latham's body consistent with a rampaging buffalo. The writer claimed that the commandant believed, based on the physical evidence and on the conflicting reports of the porters under questioning, that it was possible Latham had been murdered by one of more of his porters, perhaps in order to steal his rifles, but was unable to prove it. Latham was originally buried in Fort Lamy (now N'djamena, capital city of Chad), because French colonial law forbade the transport of any human remains to another country until a full year had lapsed since death. In January 1914 Latham's mother arranged to have her son's corpse disinterred and shipped to Le Havre where he was re-interred in the family plot. He had never married and thus left no direct descendants.
Latham's own written account of his final weeks in the bush described his unease over the discipline of his team of bearers, and also his anxiety over the levels of discord and violence that ruled this military administered area. The official investigation into Latham's death took no cognisance of his concerns and recorded the incident as a tragic hunting accident.
Aviation reporter and author Harry Harper, who had witnessed Latham's career from his cross-Channel attempts to the failure of the "Monobloc" at the French military trials two years later, wrote the following about Hubert Latham in his final book, published in 1956: 
Legacy.
A statue erected by the French to Latham's memory overlooks the English Channel near Sangatte, between Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer. 
According to Henry Villard in his 2002 book - "Contact! The Story of the Early Aviators" :
As the D939 route passes through Maillebois it is named 'rue Hubert Latham'.()

Coumaphos is a nonvolatile, fat-soluble phosphorothioate with ectoparasiticide properties: it kills insects and mites. It is well known by a variety of brand names as a dip or wash, used on farm and domestic animals to control ticks, mites, flies and fleas. 
It is also used to control "Varroa" mites in honey bee colonies, though in many areas it is falling out of favor as the mites develop resistance and as the residual toxicity effects are becoming better understood.
In Australia, its registration as suited to home veterinary use was cancelled by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority in June 2004 after the manufacturer failed to show it was safe for use on pets.
The compound has been linked to neurological problems in bees, and may be a factor in colony collapse.

Palmer Park is a public park in Detroit, Michigan's Palmer Park Apartment Building Historic District. It is named for U.S. Senator Thomas Witherell Palmer, who initially created the park when he donated for a city park in 1893 on the condition that the virgin forest be preserved. The park includes a historic log cabin, a public golf course, tennis courts, hiking and biking trails and a large pond known as Lake Frances.
History.
U.S. Senator Thomas Witherell Palmer donated for a city park in 1893, on the condition that the virgin forest be preserved. Palmer had inherited 80 acres from his grandfather, Michigan politician and Judge, James Witherell and, in his lifetime, expanded his holdings to 640 acres. Palmer continued to donate land throughout his life, and following his death, and that of his wife, his benefactors subdivided what became known as the Palmer Park Apartment Building Historic District, which is now a part of the National Register of Historic Places. A total of was allocated to Palmer Park. The name Palmer that gave it, Log Cabin Park, did not stick and in 1897, the Detroit Common Council unanimously approved an ordinance to officially rename it Palmer Park.
The park had a large white wooden casino, which burned down in May 1945.
The city planned to close Palmer Park in 2010 due to budget constraints, but relented open after a public rally.
Palmer Park Citizens Action Council.
During the 1970s and early ’80s, the Palmer Park Citizens Action Council staged festivals, ran a CB radio patrol, and received several park-improvement grants.
People for Palmer Park.
People for Palmer Park is a nonprofit organization created in 2010 that, with the Detroit government's blessing, supports renovation and revitalization work in the park. On June 24, 2012, the group partnered with the City of Detroit to open the Palmer Log Cabin to the public as part of a fundraiser to restore the structure.
Palmer Park Golf Course.
Palmer Park Golf Course is an 18-hole regulation length golf course within the park that hosts golf outings and tournaments through the Palmer Park Golf club. Since 1927, Palmer Park Golf Course has been home turf for many notable Detroit residents including Motown performers Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, Four Tops, and boxer Joe Louis. The course has a short layout that is mostly flat.
Lake Frances.
A man-made lake dotted with small islands and anchored by a miniature red-and-white lighthouse that was once lit with an oil lamp. It was created at Senator Palmer's behest and named for his mother-in-law.
The Recreation Department created a second lake west of the current site of the Splash Park, to use as a fish breeding pond. Beyond it to the west, was Lake Harold with an island called Inselruh and a waterfall called Pontiac Cascade. Local legend states that the great Chief Pontiac was buried near the site of the waterfall. In the 1950s, Lake Harold was filled with earth excavated during the construction of the Lodge Freeway.
Merrill Humane Fountain.
The Merrill Fountain was designed by the architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings and originally stood in front of the old Detroit Opera House in Campus Martius Park. Built in 1904 at a cost of , it was named for Charles Merrill and dedicated by his daughter, Elizabeth Palmer. As automobile traffic increased in downtown Detroit, the city’s elders decided to move the fountain to the Merrill Plaissance, at the far southern boundary of Palmer Park, in 1926. The fountain functioned for one season in the park and then pipes broke. It has been dry for over 50 years and suffered from theft of pieces and desctruction by vandals.
The fountain is a white marble structure in the Italian Renaissance style. In the forefront is a circular pool leading up one level to another pool which is clover-shaped with three marble blocks in the center, each with a water spout. At the top of the fountain is an arch carved into cattails and water lilies over a niche containing a marble turtle straddled by two stylized fish. From the mouths of the figures water spouts lead to a vase-like pool beneath. Three steps lead from the clover-shaped pool to a balustrade on either side of the arch. The balusters are decorated with glyphs, four lion heads, and two gargoyles at the huge end posts; all of which spout water into the clover-shaped pool. Two scrolls dip from each post to the wall which surrounds the lower circular pool. Another small pool lies behind the arch and two small fountains hang off each end post of the balustrade.
Palmer Log Cabin.
In 1885, U.S. Senator Thomas Witherell Palmer had the architecture firm of Mason & Rice design a rustic log cabin-style summer house on land which now compromises part of Palmer Park. The design was a gift for his wife, Lizzie Merrill Palmer, who was growing weary of the traffic, noise and crowds of the city. She wanted a retreat where she could live as people had in the early days: simply, peacefully, and on plenty of land. Construction on the cabin was complete in 1887. It sits near the bank of Lake Frances. The Palmer Log Cabin was originally known as “Font Hill Log House.”
The two-story log cabin is built from oak logs on a brick foundation. Wooden awnings shade the windows and two chimneys rise from each end of the house. Inside, red brick fireplaces warm the dining room on the north end and the parlor on the south end. The walls were once plastered, the floor is laid with white maple and walnut planks, and the grand staircase is carved from oak. The Palmers filled the Cabin with family heirlooms, souvenirs from Palmer’s stint as Ambassador to Spain, and relics meant to evoke Michigan’s pioneer days. Above the mantel was a flintlock pistol. Over the front door were elk antlers. Other items included James Witherell’s mahogany grandfather clock, built in 1787; a century-old Gelt V. Walker piano; leather buckets from the days of Detroit’s ”bucket brigade” fire department; spinning wheels; a Mexican saddle and spurs; a stuffed blue heron; an elk’s head; and various swords, snow-shoes and Indian bows and arrows. Family portraits and paintings of presidents hung on the walls. The cabin’s furniture had been used by generations of Palmers and Witherells; both Lizzie and Thomas’s childhood highchairs had a place in the dining room, and Judge Witherell had brought his hand-made dining room chairs from Vermont in 1808. In the parlor they kept a baby cradle from 1822 that Thomas Palmer and each of his 8 brothers and sisters slept in at some point. From the rafters hung bundles of herbs, dried fruit, corn, and a birch bark canoe.
The Palmers were not ostentatious people, who enjoyed spending their summers at the log cabin and sharing it with their neighbors as well as friends and acquaintances from all over the nation. In 1911, a writer for a horse-breeding gazette recalled that “there was no formality” at Log Cabin feasts; “Dinner,” he wrote, “was announced with an old tin horn.” Whenever a fellow Senator visited, Palmer asked him to plant a tree, from which he hung a brass plaque engraved with his name.
For a period, the Log Cabin was a major tourist attraction, and in the summer visitors from all over the world thronged in for a look. It stayed open until 1979, when the city gave its artifacts to the Detroit Historical Society for safekeeping and closed the Log Cabin to the public. It served a community center during the 1960s before it closed due to a lack of city funding. On June 24, 2012, the group People for Palmer Park partnered with the City of Detroit to open the cabin to the public for only the second time since 1979, as part of a fundraiser to restore the building's roof.
Old Spanish Bell.
Near the western entrance to the Log Cabin is a large bell hanging — originally in a rustic wooden frame. This bell was designed and cast by Paula Gomez in Spain in 1793 and was taken to Mexico over 200 years ago. William A. Moore, Senator James McMillan and other friends of Senator Palmer raised funds to purchase the bell, as a gift, who in turn, presented it to the city.
Palmer Park Splash Park.
The Palmer Park Splash Park, the second splash park in Detroit, opened August 18, 2013 through a donation by Lear Corporation. The park is located just west of Woodward between Six and Seven Mile Roads, on what was once the grounds of an Olympic-size community swimming pool. It features colorful spouts that spray water from several directions. The park has motion censors programmed to turn the water on and off when the splash park opens and closes each day.

Battles of the Kinarot Valley

The Battles of the Kinarot Valley (), is a collective name for a series of military engagements between the Haganah and the Syrian army during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, fought between May 15–22, 1948 in the Kinarot Valley. It includes two main sites: the Battle of Degania–Tzemah, and battles near Masada – Sha'ar HaGolan. The engagements were part of the battles of the Jordan Valley, which also saw fighting against Transjordan in the area of Gesher.
The battles began shortly after the Israeli declaration of independence, when Syria shelled Ein Gev on the night of May 15–16. They were the first military engagement between Israel and Syria. On May 18, Syria attacked the Israeli forward position in Tzemah (Samakh), and on May 20 attacked Degania Alef and occupied Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan. The attack on Degania Alef was a failure, after which the Syrian forces attempted to capture Degania Bet. After reaching a stalemate, they retreated to their initial position in Tel al-Qasr, where they remained until the end of the war.
The campaign was perceived as a decisive Israeli victory, causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command and the birth of heroic tales in Israel. However, Syria made a small territorial gain and certain actions were criticized within Israel, such as the retreat from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan.
Background.
The first stage of the 1948 War, referred to as the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, started following the ratification of UN Resolution 181 on November 29, 1947, which granted Israel the mandate to declare independence. This was declared on May 14, 1948 and the next night, the armies of a number of Arab states invaded Israel and attacked Israeli positions.
The Arab states surrounding the Mandate of Palestine started to prepare themselves a few weeks before May 15. According to the Arab plan, the Syrian army was to attack the new state from southern Lebanon and capture Safed. As such, the Syrians massed their forces in that area; however, after they found out that Lebanon did not wish to actively participate in combat, their plans changed to an attack from the southern Golan Heights on Samakh (Tzemah) and later Tiberias. The Syrian force assembled in Qatana on May 1. It moved on May 12 to Beirut and to Sidon on May 13, after which it headed to Bint Jbeil. After the sudden plan change, the force moved to Nabatieh, and proceeded around the Finger of the Galilee to Banias and Quneitra, from which the eventual attack was staged.
The Syrian Army was meant to consist of two brigade-sized units, but there was no time to prepare them, thus only the 1st Brigade was in a state of readiness by May 15. It had about 2,000 soldiers in two infantry battalions, one armored battalion, and 4–6 artillery batteries.
Prelude.
According to plan, the Syrians attacked from the southern Golan Heights, just south of the Sea of Galilee through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement. This came as a surprise to the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.
On Friday, May 14, the Syrian 1st Infantry Brigade, commanded by Colonel Abdullah Wahab el-Hakim, was in Southern Lebanon, positioned to attack Malkia. That day Hakim was ordered to return to Syria, move south across the Golan and enter Palestine south of the Sea of Galilee through Tzemah. He began to advance at 9:00 AM on Saturday and had only two of his battalions, where the soldiers were already exhausted.
At the onset of the invasion, the Syrian force consisted of a reinforced infantry brigade, supplemented by at least one armored battalion (including Renault R35 tanks) and a field artillery battalion. The troops moved to Kafr Harib and were spotted by Haganah reconnaissance, but because the attack was not expected, the Israeli troops did not attack the invaders. At night between 15 and 16 May, the bulk of the Syrian forces set up camp in Tel al-Qasr in the southwestern Golan. One company with armored reinforcements split up to the south to proceed to the Jewish water station on the Yarmouk riverbank.
The Haganah forces in the area consisted of several units from the Barak (2nd) Battalion of the Golani Brigade, as well as the indigenous villagers, including a reduced Guard Corps (HIM) company at the Tzemah police station. This force was headed by the battalion commander's deputy, who was killed in action in the battle. On May 13, the battalion commander declared a state of emergency in the area from May 15 until further notice. He authorized his men to seize all necessary arms from the settlements and urged them to dig in and build fortifications as fast as possible, and to mobilize all the necessary work force to do so.
Battles.
On Saturday night, May 15, the observation posts reported many vehicles with full lights moving along the Golan ridge east of the Sea of Galilee. The opening shots were fired by Syrian artillery on kibbutz Ein Gev at approximately 01:00 on May 16. At dawn, Syrian aircraft attacked the Kinarot valley villages. The following day, a Syrian company which split from the main force attacked the water station with heavy weaponry, where every worker was killed except one.
An Israeli reserve unit was called in from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took positions around the town. At that point, Tzemah was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages. They entrenched in the actual village, which had been abandoned by the residents in April 1948, with British escort. Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya neighborhood in the south, and the railway station. The Syrians set up their positions in an abandoned British military base just east of the village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast.
Two Israeli sappers were sent to mine the area of the quarantine station, but did not know that it was already under Syrian control. Their vehicle was blown up, but they managed to escape alive. On the same day, the Syrian company that attacked the water station from Tel ad-Dweir proceeded towards Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada. Its advance was halted by the village residents as well as a platoon of reinforcements armed with 20 mm cannons. The company retreated to its position and commenced artillery fire on the two kibbutzim.
This development gave the Israeli forces time to organize their defenses at Samakh (Tzemah). During the course of May 16, Israeli gunboats harassed the Syrian positions on the southeastern Sea of Galilee shore, trenches were dug, and roadblocks were set up. Meanwhile, Syrian aircraft made bombing runs on Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan, Degania Bet and Afikim. The attack on Tzemah resumed before dawn on May 17—the Syrians attacked the village's northern positions, but their armor stayed behind. The infantry thus could not advance into the concentrated Israeli fire from the village itself, despite severe ammunition shortages on the Israeli side.
Meanwhile, the defenders of Tiberias believed their town would be targeted next, and built barricades and fortifications. Ben-Gurion told the cabinet that "The situation is very grave. There aren't enough rifles. There are no heavy weapons". Aharon Israeli, a platoon leader, commented that there was also a severe lack of experienced field commanders—he himself was hastily promoted on May 15, despite not having sufficient knowledge or experience. Also on May 16, the Syrian President, Shukri al-Quwatli, visited the front with his Prime Minister, Jamil Mardam, and his Defense Minister, Taha al-Hashimi. He told his forces "to destroy the Zionists".
At night, A Syrian force attempted to surround the Israelis by crossing the Jordan River to the north of the Sea of Galilee, but encountered a minefield in which a senior Syrian officer was wounded. This was spotted and reported by the Israelis at Tabgha, and the additional reprieve allowed the Kinarot Valley villages to evacuate the children, elderly and sick, as well as conduct maneuvers which feigned massive reinforcements in the Poria-Alumot region. In the panic of surprise, many men also tried to flee the frontal villages, but blockposts were set up near Afula and Yavne'el by the Military Police Service's northern command, under Yosef Pressman, who personally stopped buses and allowed only the women and children to proceed to safety.
Tzemah.
At about 04:30 on May 18, the Syrian 1st Brigade, now commanded by Brigadier General Husni al-Za'im and consisting of about 30 vehicles, including tanks, advanced west towards Tzemah (Samakh) in two columns—one across the coast, and another flanking from the south. A contingent was allocated further south, in order to secure the safety of the main force by flanking Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada from the west. It entered a stalemate with a new Israeli position northwest of the two villages.
The coastal column shelled the Israeli positions and inflicted enormous damage; the Israelis were either dug in in shallow trenches made for infantry warfare with no head cover, or in Tzemah's clay houses that were vulnerable to heavy weapons. The Israelis were eventually forced to abandon their posts and concentrate in the police station, where they brought the wounded. The deputy commander of the Golani Brigade, Tzvika Levkov, also arrived at the station, and called reinforcements from Sha'ar HaGolan and Tiberias, which did not manage to arrive on time.
A soldier who participated in the battle reported that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Tzemah. The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces would be completely cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Tzemah's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and did not significantly affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived that the battle was over. Cohen would not hear of a retreat initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench, they hastily withdrew.
On the same day, Syrian aircraft bombed the Israeli village Kinneret and the regional school Beit Yerah, on the southwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee. By evening, Tzemah had fallen and a new Israeli defensive line was set up in the Deganias, facing the Syrian counterparts. At night, a Palmach company from Yiftach's 3rd Battalion attempted to recapture Tzemah's police station. They stealthily reached the school next to the station, but the assault on the actual fort was warded off. On the morning of May 19, a message was sent from Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada that they were preparing for an evacuation, although when the order was given to stay put, the villages had already been abandoned, mostly to Afikim. In the morning, when the villagers carried out an order to return to their positions, local Arabs were already present at the location. The Syrian troops then captured the villages without a fight, and proceeded to loot and destroy them. Aharon Israeli wrote that an order was given not to disclose the flight of Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan's residents, but this became clear as fire and smoke rose from the villages, and hurt the morale of the Israelis making defensive preparations in the Deganias.
The counterattack on the police station failed but delayed the Syrian attack on the Deganias by twenty-four hours. In the evening of May 19, a delegation from the Deganias arrived in Tel Aviv to ask for reinforcements and heavy weapons. One of its members later wrote that David Ben-Gurion told them he could not spare them anything, as "The whole country is a front line". He also wrote that Yigael Yadin, the Chief Operations Officer of the Haganah, told him that there was no alternative to letting the Arabs approach to within twenty to thirty meters of the gates of Degania and fight their tanks in close combat. Yadin prepared reinforcements, and gave an order: "No point should be abandoned. must fight at each site". He and Ben-Gurion argued over where to sent the Yishuv's only battery of four pre-World War I 65 mm mountain guns (nicknamed "Napoleonchikim"), which had no proper sights. Ben-Gurion wanted to send them to Jerusalem, but Yadin insisted that they be sent to the Kinarot valley, and Ben-Gurion eventually agreed.
On the night of May 18–19, a platoon departed from Ein Gev by sea to Samra and raided the Syrian contingent in Tel al-Qasr. The raid failed, but may have delayed the Syrian attack on Degania, thus giving its defenders twenty-four hours to prepare. A second raid, by a Yiftach company, crossed the Jordan and struck the Syrian camp at the Customs House, near the main Bnot Yaakov Bridge. After a short battle, the Syrian defenders (one or two companies) fled. The Palmachniks destroyed the camp and several vehicles, including two armored cars, without losses.
Degania Alef.
After the fall of Tzemah, the Haganah command realized the importance of the campaign in the region, and made a clear separation between the Kinarot Valley, and the Battle of Gesher fought against Transjordan and Iraq to the south. On May 18, Moshe Dayan, who had been born in Degania, was given command of all forces in the area, after having been charged without creating a commando battalion in the 8th Brigade just a day before. A company of reinforcements from the Gadna program was allocated, along with 3 PIATs. Other reinforcements came in the form of a company from the Yiftach Brigade and another company of paramilitaries from villages in the Lower Galilee and the Jezreel Valley. The Palmach counterattack on the police station on the night of May 18 gave the Israeli forces an additional day to prepare defense and attack plans.
The Israelis called the reinforcements assuming this was the main Syrian thrust. The Syrians were not intending to carry out any further operation south of the Sea of Galilee and planned to make their main effort further north, near the Bnot Ya'akov bridge. On May 19, the Iraqis were about to drive west through Nablus toward Tulkarm, and asked the Syrians to make a diversion in the Degania area to protect their right flank. The Syrians complied, their main objective being to seize the bridge across the river north of Degania Alef, thus blocking any Israeli attack from Tiberias against the Iraqi line of communications.
Heavy Syrian shelling of Degania Alef started at about 04:00 on May 20 from the Tzemah police station, by means of 75 mm cannons, and 60 and 81 mm mortars. The barrage lasted about half an hour. At 04:30 on May 20, the Syrian army began its advance on the Deganias and the bridge over the Jordan River north of Degania Alef. Unlike the attack on Tzemah, this action saw the participation of nearly all of the Syrian forces stationed at Tel al-Qasr, including infantry, armor and artillery. The Israeli defenders numbered about 70 persons (67 according to Aharon Israeli's head count), most of them not regular fighters, with some Haganah and Palmach members. Their orders were to fight to the death. They had support from three 20 mm guns at Beit Yerah, deployed along the road from Samakh to Degania Alef. They also had a Davidka mortar, which exploded during the battle, and a PIAT with fifteen projectiles.
At night, a Syrian expeditionary force attempted to infiltrate Degania Bet, but was caught and warded off, which caused the main Syrian force to attack Degania Alef first. At 06:00, the Syrians started a frontal armored attack, consisting of 5 tanks, a number of armored vehicles and an infantry company. The Syrians pierced the Israeli defense, but their infantry was at some distance behind the tanks. The Israelis knocked out four Syrian tanks and four armored cars with 20 mm cannons, PIATs and Molotov cocktails. Meanwhile, other defenders kept small arms fire on the Syrian infantry, who stopped in citrus groves a few hundred meters from the settlements. The surviving Syrian tanks withdrew back to the Golan. At 07:45, the Syrians halted their assault and dug in, still holding most of the territory between Degania Alef's fence and Samakh's police fort. They left behind a number of lightly damaged or otherwise inoperable tanks that the Israelis managed to repair.
Degania Bet.
Despite the Syrian superiority in numbers and equipment, the destruction of a multitude of armored vehicles and the infantry's failure to infiltrate Degania Alef was the likely cause for the retreat of the main Syrian force to Tzemah. A less-organized and sparsely numbered armored and infantry force forked off to attack Degania Bet. Eight tanks, supported by mortar fire, moved within 400 yards of the settlement defense, where they stopped to provide fire support for an infantry attack. The Syrians made two failed attempts to breach the Israeli small arms fire defense and gave up the attempt. Against this force, the Israelis had about 80 people and one PIAT. The defenses in Degania Bet were disorganized and there were not enough trenches. They also had no communication link to the command, so Moshe Dayan sent one of his company commanders to assess the situation.
While the battle was taking place, the 65 mm artillery, four "Napoleonchik canons", reached the front in the middle of the day and were placed on the Poria–Alumot ridge. It was the first Israeli artillery to be used in the war. At 13:20, they began to fire at the Syrians, and about 40 rounds the latter began to retreat. The Israelis also fired into Samakh, where the Syrian officers, who had until then believed that the Israelis had nothing that could hit their headquarters, took shelter. One projectile hit the Syrian ammunition depot in the village, and others ignited fires in the dry fields. While the soldiers who operated the cannons (still lacking sights) were not proficient in handling them, an acceptable level of accuracy was achieved after practice shots into the Sea of Galilee. In all, the artillery fire took the Syrian army by complete surprise, and the latter decided to regroup and retreat to Tel al-Qasr, also recalling the company at Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada. A total of 500 shells were fired by the Israeli artillery. Syrian officers may have shot some of their fleeing soldiers.
There were two other reasons for the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the previous night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, noticed and shelled by the Syrians, but one of the companies managed to climb up the Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. The second reason was that they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im had been promised replenishment, and attacked Degania short of ammunition. Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition. The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis were not aware of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.
Aftermath and effects.
On May 21, Haganah troops returned to Tzemah and set up fortifications, The damaged tanks and armored cars were gathered and taken to the rear. The settlers returned that night to identify the bodies of their comrades in the fields and buried them in a common grave in Degania. At dawn on May 21, the Golani staff reported that the enemy was repelled but that they were expecting another attack. The full report read:
On May 22, villagers returned to Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, which had been largely destroyed. Expecting another attack, reinforcements from the Carmeli Brigade took up positions in the two villages. Many of the participants of the battles were sent to Tiberias to rest and recuperate, and the units that lost soldiers were reorganized.
In the wake of the fall of Gush Etzion, news of Degania's successful stand (as well as that of Kfar Darom) provided a morale boost for other Israeli villages. The battle also influenced British opinion on the balance of power in the war. The success of the Napoleonchik field cannons prompted the Israeli high command to re-use two of them in attempts to capture Latrun. The flight from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, on the other hand, stirred controversy in the young state, fueled by news of the Kfar Etzion massacre just days before, and the Palmach issued a newsletter accusing them of abandoning national assets, among other things. These accusations were subsequently repeated in media and in a play by Yigal Mossensohn, and a campaign was started by the villagers to clear their name.
The battles of the Kinarot Valley were the first and last of the major ground engagements between Israel and Syria to the south of the Sea of Galilee, although minor patrol skirmishes continued until the . The campaign, combined with the Battle of Gesher, was possibly the only coordinated attack between two or more Arab countries in the northern front. At the end, the Syrians held Tel al-Qasr, which was part of the British Mandate of Palestine and the Jewish state according to the UN partition of 1947. Despite the above, the offensive was considered a decisive Syrian defeat by both sides. The Syrian defense minister Ahmad al-Sharabati and Chief of Staff Abdullah Atfeh blamed each other, the latter resigning and the former being dismissed by the prime minister as a result of the battle. As reasons for their defeat, they gave their low level of preparedness and the strength of the Israeli defenses, as well as their lack of coordination with the Iraqis (according to one Syrian historian, the Iraqis were supposed to assist them in the Deganias). After the battle, British observers became convinced that the Arabs were not going to win the war, and compared the battle to the Luftwaffe's failure in the Battle of Britain in 1940, which showed that Germany was not going to win the air war. The observers said that "A greater edge than the enjoyed at Degania they won't have again".
First tank kill controversy.
The first Syrian tank damaged near Degania Alef's gates, which has been preserved on the location, was the subject of a historiographic dispute when Baruch "Burke" Bar-Lev, a retired IDF colonel and one of Degania's native defenders at the time, claimed that he was the one who stopped the tank with a Molotov cocktail. However, his account was rebutted by an IDF Ordnance Corps probe, which in 1991 determined that a PIAT shot had killed the tank's crew. Shlomo Anschel, a Haifa resident who also participated in the battle, told Haaretz in 2007 that the tank was hit by PIAT fire from a Golani soldier, and that the Molotov cocktail could not possibly have hit the crew.

History of Poole

The history of Poole, a town in Dorset, England, can be traced back to the founding of a settlement around Poole Harbour during the Iron Age. The town now known as Poole was founded on a small peninsula to the north of the harbour. Poole experienced rapid growth as it became an important port following the Norman Conquest of England.
Toponymy.
The town's name derives from the Old English words "pool" which means a place near a pool or creek and "pol" which was given to people who lived near a small body of water. Variants include Pool, Pole, Poles, Poll, Polle, Polman, and Poolman.
Early history.
The Poole Harbour area has been inhabited for at least 2,500 years. During the Iron Age, Celtic people known as the Durotriges lived in Dorset, particularly around Wareham, five miles (8 km) to the west. In the 3rd century BC, these Celtic people moved from hilltop settlements, such as Maiden Castle and Badbury Rings on the chalk downs to the north, to the lower vales and heathland around the River Frome and Poole Harbour. This marshy area may have lent its name to the Durotriges, which means "water dwellers". The Durotriges engaged in cross-channel trading at Poole with the Veneti, a seafaring tribe from Brittany. The earliest significant archaeological find in the harbour is the Poole Logboat, a boat made from a single oak tree and dating to 295 BC. During that time, the harbour was shallower than it is today and any settlement would now be under water.
Poole was one of a number of harbouring sites along the south coast of Britain where the Romans landed during their conquest of Britain the 1st century. The Roman Emperor, Vespasian, brought the Second Augustan Legion to the harbour in 43 AD and founded Hamworthy, an area just west of the modern town centre. The Romans and continued to use the harbour throughout the occupation.
Middle Ages.
Following the Saxon invasion of southern Britain in the 7th century, Poole was included in the newly established Kingdom of Wessex. Poole was used as a base for fishing and a place for ships to anchor on their way to Wareham, an important Saxon stronghold. A Danish Viking army captured Wareham in 876 but they were besieged and defeated by a Saxon army led by Alfred the Great. The Danish fleet retreated though Poole Harbour but most of their longships sank in a violent storm off the coast of Poole Bay and Studland. The Danes returned to England under Canute the Great in 1015. He led his fleet to Poole Harbour which he used as a base to pillage the surrounding settlements of Wessex before returning along the coast to attack London.
Poole remained a small fishing town until the Norman Conquest. During the 12th and 13th centuries the maritime and fishing trade of Poole grew as the importance of Wareham declined. A charter of liberties was sold to the Burgesses of Poole in 1248 by the Lord of the Manor and son of the Earl of Salisbury, Sir William Longspee, to raise funds for his participation the Seventh Crusade. As a result of this charter, Poole obtained the right to appoint a mayor, hold a court within town, and was granted an exemption from certain tolls and customs duties on goods from the Port.
A French and Spanish naval fleet attacked Poole in 1405, burning and looting much of the town in revenge for the exploits of Poole privateer captain Henry Paye. Paye frequently led successful raids against the Spanish and French along the coast from Normandy through to the Bay of Biscay and Cape Finisterre. Despite this setback, the town continued to grow and became the biggest port in Dorset. In 1433 it was granted Port of the Staple status by King Henry VI, which enabled Poole to begin the lucrative trade of wool exportation. This status also allowed Poole to receive a license for the construction of fortifications; a wall and ditch were constructed and a stone gatehouse was erected on the northern side of the town.
Early modern history.
During the English Civil War Poole was staunchly puritan and a Parliamentary stronghold within a mostly Royalist Dorset. Nearby, Wimborne and the Bankes family in nearby Corfe Castle had sided with King Charles. The walled town of Poole constantly under the threat of siege but remained one of Cromwell's strongholds until the end of the war. In 1646 with the Royalists on the verge of defeat, the Parliamentary army from Poole laid siege to Corfe Castle. The Royalists surrendered and Parliament ordered the destruction of the castle to ensure that it could never stand again as a Royalist stronghold. Upon the restoration of the monarchy Poole's defences were demolished on the orders of King Charles II.
The town continued to grow in importance despite the effects of piracy. In 1568, Poole was granted a greater amount of independence from Dorset when it was made a county corporate by the Great Charter of Queen Elizabeth I. The Great Charter also granted Poole the title of 'the County of the Town of Poole', a name it retained until the 18th century.
Poole established successful commerce with the North American colonies, including the important fisheries of Newfoundland that later resulted in significant lasting trade. By the mid 16th century records show that large quantities of salt, an essential ingredient for the salt cod trade, was being landed at Poole. Over the next fifty years the trade with Newfoundland steadily grew to meet the demand for fish from the Catholic countries of Europe. Poole's share of this trade varied but the most prosperous period of trade started in the early 18th century and lasted until the early 19th century. The trade was a three-cornered route; ships went out to Newfoundland loaded with salt and provisions. Caught, dried, and salted in Newfoundland, the fish was brought back to ports in Spain, Portugal and Italy. Finally the ships returned to Poole with wine, olive oil, dried fruits, and salt.
Modern history.
In the early 18th century, Poole had more ships trading with North America than any other English port, which brought vast wealth to Poole's merchants. This prosperity supported much of the development which now characterises the Old Town near the Quay. Many of the town’s Medieval buildings were replaced with extravagant Georgian houses, many of which can still be seen. Examples include Sir Peter Thompson's 1746 Grade I listed mansion designed by John Bastard, and Beech Hurst, a Grade II* listed mansion built on Poole High Street in 1789.
The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814 and the conclusion of the War of 1812 changed the fortunes of Poole’s Newfoundland merchants. Peace meant that the French and Americans could fish the waters and take over many of the services provided by Poole merchants at a lower cost. The result was rapid decline in trade and within a few years most of the merchants had ceased trading.
The town grew rapidly during the industrial revolution as urbanisation took place and the town became both an area of mercantile prosperity and of overcrowded poverty. At the turn of the 19th century, nine out of ten workers in Poole were engaged in harbour activities, but as the century progressed ships became too large for the shallow harbour and the port began losing business to the deep water ports at Liverpool, Southampton and Plymouth. In 1847 Poole's first railway station opened in Hamworthy and later extended to the centre of Poole in 1872, effectively ending the port's busy coastal shipping trade. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stationed a lifeboat at Sandbanks in 1865. The crew had to travel in a horse-drawn carriage from the Antelope Hotel in Poole High Street whenever it was launched so it was moved to a new Poole Lifeboat Station at the Fisherman's Dock on Poole Quay in 1882.
During the 19th century the beaches and landscape of southern Dorset and south-west Hampshire began to attract tourists and the villages to the east of Poole began to grow and merge until the seaside resort of Bournemouth emerged. Although Poole did not become a resort like many surrounding towns, it continued to grow as the rapid expansion of Bournemouth created a large demand for goods manufactured in Poole. In 1897, the Haven Hotel in Poole was the site of some of Marconi's wireless experiments. Marconi was able to receive radio signals in Poole sent from Alum Bay, Isle of Wight, away.
World War II and redevelopment.
Poole was the third largest embarkation point for D-Day landings of Operation Overlord, and afterwards served as a base for supplies to the allied forces in Europe. Eighty-one landing craft containing US Army troops from the 29th Infantry Division and the US Army Rangers departed Poole Harbour for Omaha Beach in France. Poole was also an important centre for the development of Combined Operations and it was the base for the US Coast Guard's 'Rescue Flotilla One' of 60 cutters. The cutters patrolled the D-Day invasion areas, with 30 serving off of the British and Canadian sectors and 30 serving off the American sectors. A US Coast Guard ensign is buried at St James' Church and a plaque on the quayside given by the United States Coast Guard commemorates the cutters departure for the Normandy Invasion and expresses appreciation for the kindness of the people of Poole to the crews.
Many of the town's buildings suffered bombing during the Second World War and years of neglect in the post-war in the United Kingdom. Major redevelopment projects began across the town in the 1960s. Large areas of slum properties were demolished and replaced with modern public housing, Poole General Hospital was built in 1969, and a large indoor shopping centre called the Arndale Centre (now known as the Dolphin Centre) was also finished that year. Many of Poole's historic buildings were also demolished during this period, especially in the Old Town area of Poole. Consequently, a Conservation Area was created in the town centre in 1975 to preserve some of Poole's most notable buildings. The RNLI moved its headquarters from London to Poole in 1974. This year also saw the lifeboat station at Fisherman's Dock close for conversion into a lifeboat museum. The lifeboat operated from a new station at Lilliput Marina until 1989 when it was moved to a new site on Poole Quay by Poole Bridge.
Building regeneration projects include the demolition of Hamworthy (Poole) power station in the early 1990s and the redevelopment of the old gas works. The latter has become part of the "Poole Quarter", a housing project near the town centre, comprising 512 new homes. Other projects include the renovated arts centre and the new Royal National Lifeboat Institution headquarters. The construction boom was acknowledged in 2007, when the Borough of Poole received an award celebrating the best of the British construction industry.

Its Greek text of the Gospels is an excellent representative of the Alexandrian text-type, but with some Byzantine readings, particularly in Acts of the Apostles and the Pauline epistles. Aland placed it in Category II in Gospels and to Category I in rest of books of the New Testament. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents the Alexandrian text-type as its weak member.
History.
Scholz and Martin dated the manuscript to the 11th century. Gregory dated it to the 9th or 10th century. Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 9th century.
It was called "the queen of the cursives" by J. G. Eichhorn (1752-1827), but now it has several rivals (81, 892, 1175, 1739). The manuscript was examined by many scholars, such as Griesbach, who collated its text in Matthew 1-18. It was also studied by Birch and others. The text of the codex was fully collated by S. P. Tregelles in 1850. Tregelles said that, of all the manuscripts he collated (presumably excluding palimpsests), it was the hardest to read. 
It was examined and described by Paulin Martin. C. R. Gregory saw the manuscript twice, in 1884 and in 1885.
The manuscript was included to a critical apparatus by Kurt Aland in his 25th edition of Novum Testamentum Graece (1963).
The codex is located now at the National Library of France (Cod. Gr. 14) at Paris.

The Road Back (film)

The Road Back is a 1937 drama film made by Universal Pictures, directed by James Whale. The screenplay is by Charles Kenyon and R. C. Sherriff from the eponymous novel by Erich Maria Remarque.
The novel on which the film is based was banned during Nazi rule. When the film was made, Universal Pictures was threatened with a boycott of all their films by the German government unless the anti-Nazi sentiments in the script were watered down. Carl Laemmle and his son, Carl Laemmle, Jr., the former heads of Universal, had recently been ousted by a corporate takeover. The new studio heads, fearing a financial loss, caved in to the pressure and edited the film before releasing it, much to director James Whale's displeasure. Disgusted with the studio's cowardice under its new management, Whale left Universal after completing "Wives Under Suspicion", an unsuccessful remake of his own "The Kiss Before the Mirror". He returned two years later to direct "Green Hell", but never made another film for Universal after that.

Camp Sherman Community Hall

The Camp Sherman Community Hall is the center of social activity in the community of Camp Sherman in central Oregon. The hall hosts a variety of public and private events throughout the year. The building is owned and operated by the "Camp Sherman Community Association". Because of its unique rustic architecture and importance to the history of the Camp Sherman area the hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Structure.
The Camp Sherman Community Hall is located in the small unincorporated community of Camp Sherman, Oregon. The hall was constructed by local volunteers under the direction of Wayne Korish. It is a simple rustic design. The building is a wood post-and-beam structure with a shingled exterior. The foundation is concrete. The roof is metal and asphalt.
The interior of the community hall has a large meeting area downstairs along with kitchen and bathroom facilities. The structural beams are hand-hewn and are exposed on the interior giving the main hall a rustic feel. The interior walls are covered with knotty pine paneling, and the floor boards are straight-grain fir. There is a large stone fireplace located on the north side of the main hall. The upstairs is an attic storage area.
History.
The Camp Sherman Community Association was formed in 1948 to meet the social and civic needs of the Camp Sherman community. The following year, the association built a community hall facing Camp Sherman Road on property donated by Hays and Roblay McMullin, who owned Lake Creek Lodge at that time. The project was financed by local fund raising. The building was constructed using labor donated by members of the Camp Sherman community.
Since 1949, the Camp Sherman Community Hall has been the gathering place for local residents and the venue for countless events. The hall is the site of pancake breakfast events on Memorial Day, Fourth of July, and Labor Day. It is also used for the community’s Christmas bazaar, winter potluck dinners, community meetings, and well known quilt fairs held twice a year. Dances, bingo nights, and other social events are held in the hall as well. The building is also available for private events such as weddings and family reunions. During elections years, the hall is the venue for candidate forums.
Volunteers remodeled the community hall in 1983, expanding the kitchen and storage areas. Indoor plumbing was also added at the rear of the hall. During the 1990s, other improvements were made to the building including replacing the roof, installing a new propane heating system, and a new stage was built. On the outside, a lawn with picnic tables was added south of the building.
In 2004, volunteers from the Camp Sherman community completed a major renovation of the community hall "(project photos)". The project included excavations beneath the building to replace floor beams and sill plates, installation of a new heating system, and restoration and refinishing of the floor in the main hall. The fireplace and chimney were also repaired, and new front doors were installed. The projected was financed by contributions from the local community and a grant from the National Register of Historic Places.
Camp Sherman Community Association.
Anyone who owns property or rents a home full-time in the Black Butte School District is eligible for membership in the Camp Sherman Community Association. Membership fees are used to preserve, maintain, and operate the Camp Sherman Community Hall. Association members are eligible to rent the hall for private events such as wedding and family reunions. Members also receive a newsletter with community news and upcoming events scheduled at the hall.
According to its Articles of Incorporation, the association’s purpose is:
Since it was built, the Camp Sherman Community Hall has played an important part in meeting the social and civic goals of the Camp Sherman Community Association.

<doc id="19082257" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19082257" title="NHS Redress Act 2006">
NHS Redress Act 2006

The NHS Redress Act 2006 (c 44) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
The title of the Act establishes tort based liability as the necessary condition for obtaining redress.
The Act is concerned exclusively with "qualifying liability in tort" and affirms Parliament’s view that fault based liability should remain the basis of compensation for clinical mishaps. 
The statute is important legislation since it potentially affects NHS hospital patients; the intention is to extend its operation to primary care. The underlying policy of the Act is to provide a genuine alternative to litigation. The Act does not affect any private law rights. It is wholly concerned with the process of compensation; it does not alter the basis of compensation. It is procedural, not substantive.
The Act proposes a redress package where there has been clinical negligence in hospital. The redress package must include: an offer of compensation, explanation, apology and report of action to prevent similar occurrences. The redress package may include care or treatment. The package can be accepted with waiver of the right to sue, or rejected. The redress scheme is to be run by the NHS Litigation Authority. 
The proposed redress scheme is a consensual process, not a judicial process; redress is offered not awarded. Proceeding under the redress scheme is voluntary. Proceedings under the redress scheme and civil legal proceedings are mutually exclusive: they cannot be conducted at the same time. Legal rights are suspended but remain intact during the redress process when legal liability is assessed; legal liability is not adjudicated upon by the scheme’s procedure since it does is not a tribunal. Legal rights are only determined if any offer is made and accepted as part of a compromise agreement. 
The Act is enabling legislation and the detail of its operation will be set out in regulation. However, indications of its likely operation may be gleaned from Parliamentary debate and in supporting documentation. For example, there are indications that: (1) the scheme proposes that any offer made will be without prejudice, so that if it is rejected it may not be taken as evidence of liability in any legal proceedings; (2) the upper limit for monetary compensation will be £20,000; (3) legal privilege will not be asserted in respect of the investigation report.

Jackie Payne

Jackie Payne is an American blues singer. He was nominated in both 2007 and 2008 for the Blues Music Award (formerly the W. C. Handy Awards) for Best Male Soul Blues Artist; an album he recorded with Johnny Otis was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1993.
Biography.
Early career.
Payne was born in Athens, Georgia. His original birth name was William, and he was known as Willie during childhood. He trained as a singer in his father's gospel choir and learned the blues from his uncle, Neal Pattman, who played harmonica. By the age of 13, he was singing professionally with the Allen Swing Band in Atlanta. He later joined an R&B group called The Serenaders. He moved to Houston, Texas in 1963, at the age of 17, and recorded his first regional hit, "Go Go Train" b/w "I'll Be Home" on the Jetstream label in 1965. The success of that single led to a 45-city tour with the Stax revue, which at the time featured headliners like Otis Redding (to whom Payne's voice has sometimes been compared), Sam & Dave, Rufus Thomas, and Carla Thomas. His career was checked when he entered the United States Army in 1968. He then settled in Culver City, California, performing at The Cover Girl Club with Pee Wee Crayton.
The Johnny Otis years.
Payne was the lead singer for the Johnny Otis Show for fifteen years. He recorded several albums with Otis's band and appeared for many years on the Johnny Otis Saturday morning live radio radio show broadcast on KPFA-FM. "Spirit of the Black Territory Bands," recorded by The Johnny Otis Orchestra, featured Payne on vocals and was nominated for a 1993 Grammy Award. Payne's 1998 CD, "A Day In the Life of a Blues Man," was produced by Kenny Blue Ray for the British JSP Records label.
The Jackie Payne Steve Edmonson Band.
Payne and blues guitarist Steve Edmonson, formed the Jackie Payne Steve Edmonson Band in the late 1990s. The band, which was based in the San Francisco Bay Area, has recorded three albums, "Partners in the Blues" on the Burnside Records label, "Master of the Game" and "Overnight Sensation" on the Delta Groove label. The band won the Contemporary Blues Award for Best Soul Blues Album of 2006 for the "Master of the Game."

Licensed to Kill? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Shoreham Power Plant

Licensed to Kill? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Shoreham Power Plant, a 1998 book by Joan Aron, presents the first detailed case study of how an activist public and elected officials of New York state opposed the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant on Long Island. The book explains that nuclear power faltered when "public concerns about health, safety, and the environment superseded other interests about national security or energy supplies".
Aron argues that the Shoreham closure resulted from the collapse of public trust for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the entire nuclear industry. For Aron, the unwillingness of the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) management to consider true public interest in the debate resulted in "the loss of the goodwill of its customers". Also, the willingness of LILCO to press on with plans for Shoreham despite changes in the economics of nuclear power and market demand "reflected a basic failure of foresight".

The Marrying Man

The Marrying Man (known as Too Hot to Handle in the UK and Australia) is a 1991 romantic comedy film starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger. The film was directed by Jerry Rees, and written by Neil Simon. The film opened to mixed and poor reviews, with Basinger's performance in the film earning her a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress.
Plot.
Charley Pearl is the heir to a toothpaste empire's fortune. He is a playboy who doesn't work for a living, spending his time indulging in hobbies like speedboats and fast cars. Charley is engaged to be married to the daughter of Lew Horner, a foul-mouthed, hot-tempered Hollywood studio mogul. Horner is concerned that Charley has no ambition of any kind and no apparent guilt about it. The studio chief warns Charley that if he should make Adele unhappy in any way, there will be hell to pay.
His four best friends—a comedian, a songwriter, a singer and a baseball manager (none particularly successful as yet)—accompany Charley on a drive to Las Vegas for a final bachelor's fling. Charley is willing to foot the bill for Phil, Sammy, Tony and George but is eager to get back home to his fiancee. They make a quick stop for a drink at a nightclub where Vicki Anderson, a glamorous singer, immediately disrupts Charley's thoughts of wedded bliss. He tries to pick up Vicki after her performance but is sternly warned that she belongs to somebody else. Vicki responds to Charley's charm, however, and obligingly offers to leave a window open at her home. Charley shows up and they end up in bed, only to be caught in the act by her other lover—Bugsy Siegel, the notorious gangster. 
Rather than react violently, Bugsy amuses himself with the notion that he will take the scared-stiff Vicki and Charley to a justice of the peace in the middle of the night and make them marry one another. Charley drives her back to California and offers to pay her expenses, but Vicki walks out, wanting nothing more from him. In the meantime, their wedding photo pops up on the front page of the morning newspaper—with Charley's engagement announcement to Lew Horner's daughter appearing on a later page, as the enraged studio boss points out. Charley apologizes and still wants to marry a sobbing Adele. He agrees to get an annulment from Vicki and to pay a considerable sum to charity if he should dare disappoint Horner's daughter again.
Charley accidentally runs into Vicki again and can't help himself. Charley remarries Vicki and once again leaving his fiancee in the lurch. Lew Horner stops just short of killing Charley, instead sending a couple of thugs to beat him and toss him into a swimming pool. Charley accepts this as fair. Vicki is happy, too, momentarily, coming home with an offer that could advance her career, only to learn that Charley's father has died and he is needed on the other side of the country in Boston, where he is now expected to run the family's business.
Vicki puts her career on hold and spends two years in Boston, enduring high society and boring tea parties. She can't wait to get back to California and her career, but when Charley reneges on his promise, Vicki promptly gets a divorce. It doesn't take long for Charley to return west. He and his friends track Vicki to a nightclub where she has taken up with another shady figure. They become involved in a violent brawl. Charley then makes off with Vicki and marries her a third time, to the amazement of his pals. As a gesture of gratitude, Charley sinks millions of dollars into a movie studio where he intends to produce pictures featuring his wife. But while the careers of his buddies take off, Charley and Vicki begin to have children and raise a family. Nothing at the new studio gets under way and Charley goes broke. He angrily blames Vicki, who walks out on him yet again.
Divorced and depressed, a haggard-looking Charley is found by his friends quite a bit later at a nightclub, where he tells them he has recently gone into a promising new line of work: computers. He stares dreamily at the stage where Vicki is performing her act. Charley shows his friends a diamond engagement ring that he has brought with him. Vicki slides it onto her finger.
Trivia.
There has been speculation that Neil Simon based the character of Vicki on singer Marie McDonald, a '50s performer nicknamed "The Body" who was married to shoe mogul Harry Karl more than once and also reportedly the mistress of Bugsy Siegel.
Charley Pearl's four friends, the comedian, songwriter, singer and baseball manager, are believed to be loosely based on Phil Silvers, Sammy Cahn, Tony Martin and Leo Durocher, according to AllMovie.com and other sources.

Louisbourg Lighthouse

Louisbourg Lighthouse is a historic Canadian lighthouse at Louisbourg, Nova Scotia, and is the site of the first lighthouse in Canada.
The first light.
Construction began on the lighthouse in 1730 to assist navigation to Fortress Louisbourg. It was completed in 1734. A fire in 1736 destroyed the lantern but the stone tower was unharmed and a new lantern was installed in 1738. Lighthouse Point played a decisive role in both sieges of Fortress Louisbourg as, once captured, it provided a commanding gun battery location to bombard the fortress. This lighthouse was badly damaged in 1758 during the Final Siege of Louisbourg and abandoned by the British after they demolished the fortress. Stonework ruins from the first tower are still visibile at the site.
The second lighthouse.
A square wooden lighthouse with a black stripe was built by the government of Nova Scotia in 1842. The lighthouse was a large -story wooden building supported by a massive masonry base. It included the keeper's dwelling in the base of the light. A fog horn building was added in 1902. This lighthouse was destroyed by fire in 1922. The foundation remains visible today and has been excavated and stabilized by Parks Canada archaeologists.
The lighthouse today.
An octagonal concrete lighthouse decorated with neoclassical architectural features was built in 1923. The tower is a twin of the Georges Island Lighthouse in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Louisbourg lighthouse was destaffed in 1990. The lighthouse is a popular lookoff point and in 2008 became the start of a coastal walking trail. Interpretive plaques mark the ruins of the previous lighthouses.

Pithoprakta

Pithoprakta (1956) is a piece by Iannis Xenakis for 46 string instruments, two trombones, xylophone, and woodblock. Premiered by conductor Hermann Scherchen in Munich on March 1957, the piece was made into a ballet by George Balanchine, "Metastaseis and Pithoprakta", along with the earlier "Metastaseis".
The title translates as "actions through probability", and the piece is based on the statistical mechanics of gases, Gauss's law, or Brownian motion. Each instrument is conceived as a molecule obeying the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution law, with Gaussian distribution of temperature fluctuation.
Brownian motion is a four-dimensional phenomenon (three-dimensions and time), and Xenakis created the score by first creating a two-dimensional graph, necessitating some simplifications. The abscissa ("x") represents time at 5 cm = 26 MM, while the ordinates ("y") represent pitch at 1 semitone = .25 cm. When transcribed into musical notation 5 cm = one measure. This length is subdivided into three, four, and five equal parts, allowing for fine differences in duration, but also creating a steady pulse in each instrument part, reducing the rhythm of the random walk to steady footsteps ("a situation impossible in reality [of the model"). Each part gets nowhere, but as a whole the mass's pitch is freely modulated and its speed determined "temperature" varies.

Richard Clarke (radio personality)

Richard "Rich" Clarke (born August 1978) is a British radio presenter and DJ from Worcester, England, currently employed by Global Radio as a presenter on Heart South Coast. 
Student radio.
At Royal Holloway, University of London he co-operated with future BBC journalist Ed Harry, wrestling personality Dean Ayass, future Digital Radio industrialist Matt Deegan and a diverse number of fellow students to create Insanity, a student radio station which soon became a major player in the Student Radio Association, and went on to manage Insanity for Restricted Service Licence broadcasts.
Post-graduation.
After graduating, Clarke was elected on to the Executive of the Student Radio Association as a Development Officer, also attaining this position within the Radio Academy. He also worked in Greater London as a DJ and a freelance radio producer.
Career.
Richard Clarke got a break in mainstream radio when he signed to host the evening slot on CFM Radio in Carlisle. Moving from London to Cumbria, Clarke impressed station directors and was moved to the afternoon drive time. He was then offered the mid-morning slot at Wyvern FM in his home city of Worcester, presenting for two years. Clarke also regularly DJ'd at local nightclubs, often and hosted the XS concerts. A further move to Nottingham followed to host drive time on Trent FM. This led him to meet Lucy Horobin to present "Richard and Lucy". He was also the station's Deputy Programme Director, a post he had continued since working at Wyvern FM.
In January 2006, Clarke and Horobin moved north to Manchester to present a new evening show. The show was originally given the short-lived name "North West's Most Wanted" and aired on Key 103 and sister station Rock FM. By this time they were known as Rich and Luce. Following its success, the programme was rebranded "" and launched across the Big City Network as a Bauer Radio simulcast show across the North of England. Bauer's nationwide DAB station The Hits also took the programme.

Clarke joined Capital London in January 2009 to host the weeknight late slot and a Sunday evening "sorting out your problems" style show. In March 2009, he was joined by new co-presenter Kat Shoob and they presented six shows a week. Clarke has covered the Capital London's "Capital Breakfast" whilst Johnny Vaughan was absent in July 2009. From 3 January 2011, on the newly formed Capital network, Clarke sole presented every weeknight from 19:00 until 23:00 (excluding Friday's between December 2011 and March 2012).

Good Morning (Kanye West song)

"Good Morning" is a song by American hip-hop artist Kanye West. It serves as the opener for his third studio album, 2007's "Graduation". The song was produced by West and contains samples of "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" as sung by Elton John. It also contains vocals provided by Connie Mitchell and Tony "Penafire" Williams, concluding with Jay-Z's reiteration of a lyric taken from his own album intro track, "The Ruler's Back". Though not released as a single, a music video directed by "Graduation" album artwork designer Takashi Murakami was produced for the track.
Music video.
The music video for "Good Morning" is essentially the result of Japanese pop artist Takashi Murakami bringing to life the various designs he had composed for "Graduation"'s album artwork through the use of cel-shaded animation.

Smilax glyciphylla

Smilax glyciphylla, the Sweet Sarsaparilla, is a dioecious climber native to eastern Australia. It is widespread in rainforest, sclerophyll forest and woodland; mainly in coastal regions.
The leaves are distinctly three-veined with a glaucous under-surface, lanceolate, 4–10 cm long by 1.5–4 cm wide. Coiling tendrils are up to 8 cm long. The globose berries are 5–8 mm diam., black with a singular seed.
Uses.
The sweet flavoured leaves are used medicinally by Aborigines and non-indigenous colonists, including as a tea substitute
It was used medicinally in the earliest days of the colony of Port Jackson for treating scurvy, coughs and chest complaints. In correspondence to England in November 1788, Dennis Considen wrote: ""I have sent you some of the sweet tea of this country which I recommended and is generally used by the marines and convicts as such it is a fair antiscorbutic as well as a substitute for tea which is more costly.""
It was recommended as a tea alternative, tonic and antiscorbutic, and was still being traded at least up until the late 19th Century by Sydney herbalists. It is claimed to have similar properties to Jamaican sarsaparilla, "Smilax regelii".
The leaves, stems, and flowers contain the glycoside glyciphyllin, which has a bitter-sweet taste and may be the active medicinal component.
Recent research shows that "S.glycipylla" has antioxidant activity

Oregon Health &amp; Science University Hospital

Oregon Health & Science University Hospital (OHSU Hospital) is a Level I trauma center and teaching hospital in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. Part of Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), the facility has 534 beds. Located on OHSU's Marquam Hill campus south of Downtown Portland, the hospital is adjacent to Doernbecher Children's Hospital and a Shriners Hospital for Children. OHSU Hospital is one of only two Level I trauma centers in Oregon.
History.
The hospital was the subject of a lawsuit in 2006 due to a surgery performed on former television personality Ken Ackerman. The jury awarded Ackerman $1.4 million in the medical malpractice suit in a case that then spent years on appeal in the courts and saw a change in the Oregon Tort Claims Act while the case continued. In October 2008, the hospital decided to postpone a $350 million expansion of its Kohler Pavilion wing. The hospital did open 60 additional beds in the Kohler wing in February 2009, bringing the total number of hospital beds in the wing to 144.
Details.
The 534-bed hospital was ranked number 23 in the United States by "U.S. News & World Report" in 2011 for its ear, nose, and throat specialties. It was also ranked number 32 for its urology care in pediatrics and number 35 for its cancer treatment in pediatrics.

Spencer-Sharples Local School District

Spencer-Sharples Local School District was a small, impoverished district about six miles (10 km) west of Toledo, Ohio. Through a unique act of the Ohio General Assembly, Spencer-Sharples was absorbed into the non-contiguous Toledo Public Schools on Jan. 1, 1968.
History of Spencer-Sharples Local Schools.
Spencer-Sharples came into existence in 1948 when the township schools of Spencer Township and Harding Township, Ohio merged. The western half of the new school district was predominantly white, while the eastern half of the district was predominantly black. In 1958, voters in the western half of Spencer-Sharples voted to join the adjacent Swanton Local School District, and voters in the eastern half voted to join the neighboring Springfield Local School District. Swanton's board of education accepted the western half; Springfield rejected the eastern half.
After the western half joined Swanton, the remainder continued on as Spencer-Sharples Local School District.
In 1967, the Ohio General Assembly voted to allow Toledo Public Schools to annex Spencer-Sharples, despite the fact that it was not geographically connected.
Spencer-Sharples High School.
Spencer-Sharples High School operated independently from 1958 to December 31, 1967, and then as part of the Toledo Public Schools system from January 1, 1968 until 1980 when the school was closed and the student body was sent to Bowsher and Rogers high schools in Toledo. Residents of the area were mostly resistant to having their identity wiped out and having to bus their children into Toledo. Their athletic teams were called the "Falcons" and they competed as an independent. The building still stands at the intersection of Irwin and Angola roads in western Lucas County.

Wakatake-class destroyer

The were a class of eight 2nd-class destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy.
Background.
The medium-sized "Wakatake"-class destroyers were a follow-on to the as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 8-6 Fleet Program from fiscal 1921 as a lower cost accompaniment to the larger s. The class was originally planned to consist of twenty-three vessels, but due to the Washington Naval Treaty, as well as budgetary limitations, the final number was reduced to eight. The "Wakatake" class was the last class to be rated "second class" and all future destroyers were designed larger. It was planned that the "Wakatake"-class ships should have names, but upon completion they were given numbers. This proved to be extremely unpopular with the crews and was a constant source of confusion in communications, so in 1928, names were assigned.
Design.
The "Wakatake"-class destroyers were essentially slightly modified "Momi"-class ships with a deeper draft to improve handling characteristics in heavy seas, particularly against rolling. Weaponry layout, general arrangement and silhouette were all identical with the "Momi" class.
As with the "Momi" class, a number of types of turbine engines were used for propulsion. "Asagao" was built with Parsons impulse turbines, "Yūgao" with Escher Wyss & Cie Zoelly turbines, and the remaining vessels with Brown-Curtis turbines.
Operational history.
The small displacement and shallow draft of the "Wakatake" class limited their utility as fleet escorts. As with the "Momi" class, in the 1920s and 1930s, they were mainly used in Chinese coastal waters.
On September 15, 1932 "Sarawabi" capsized due to poor stability and sank north of Keelung near Taiwan.
In April 1940 "Yūgao" was re-rated as "Patrol Boat No. 46", with considerably reduced armament.
Six of the eight "Wakatake"-class destroyers still operating as destroyers on the eve of the Pacific War, equally divided between the 13th and 32nd Destroyer Divisions. Desdiv 13 comprised "Wakatake", "Kuretake", and "Sanae", and was assigned to the Kure Naval District. These ships were charged with antisubmarine patrols in the waters of the Inland Sea, Bungo Strait, and western Kyūshū. Desdiv 32 with "Asagao", "Fuyō" and "Karukaya" came under the Chinkai Guard District and spent the war's early months screening maritime traffic in the Tsushima Straits.
On April 10, 1942, the 1st Surface Escort Division of the Southwest Area Fleet was created, and Desdivs 13 and 32 were assigned to it to provide protection for convoys against Allied submarine activity. The convoy routes were initially those between Moji, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Later, these routes extended to Singapore, French Indochina, the Netherlands East Indies, and Palau. In the course of this service "Karukaya" set a record by successfully completing 54 convoy escorts before her loss.
Of the six destroyers, four were lost to American submarines, and one to an air attack. Only "Asagao" survived the war and was finally broken up in 1948.
Naming history.
The IJN originally planned that the "Wakatake"-class ships should have names, but upon completion they were given numbers due to the projected large number of warships the IJN expected to build through the Eight-eight fleet plan. This proved to be extremely unpopular with the crews and was a constant source of confusion in communications. In August 1928, names were assigned, but not the original names that were planned.

Kumaravelu Vignarajah

An ethnic Tamil, Kumaravelu Vignarajah (also "Nishanthan" to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE or Tamil Tigers), "Chandran" to Sri Lankan military intelligence) was arrested on eight charges while living in Canada, accused of infiltrating the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while fundraising for the Tamil Tigers. It was discovered he was passing Sri Lankan military secrets to the Canadians, and classified information from both Canada and Sri Lanka to the militant group.
Life.
A native of Avrankal Sri Lanka, where his "very rich" father ran a coconut plantation, He was recruited as a spy for the Sri Lankan military intelligence as early as 1982, and worked for the government forces as a spy under Lt. Col. Sunil Tennakoon. He also maintained a job at the Bank of Ceylon.
On January 9 1985, Sri Lankan forces conducted a raid in Vignarajah's hometown, killing a deputy leader of the Tigers, ostensibly after he confirmed information from a captured Tiger that suggested the deputy's presence.
By 1986, he was a trusted friend of Gopalaswamy Mahendraraja, a commander of Tiger forces. In the autumn of 1987, Vignarajah was photographed during an assault against an Indian Peace Keeping Force platoon, and his photograph was published on the cover of the November edition of "India Today". He later took a journalist from the magazine to meet Thenmuli Rajaratnam, a militant who later made headlines for assassinating Rajiv Gandhi.
In 1998 he left his job at the bank, and the following year told his government handlers that Velupillai Prabhakaran had begun to suspect he might be a spy, and thus requested their assistance fleeing the country, immigrating to Canada.
In Canada.
When Vignarajah sought to immigrate to Canada in 1994, Tennakoon wrote a series of reference letters vouching for his military and intelligence service to Canadian authorities, and he was subsequently hired as a wiretap translator for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Tenakoon kept in touch with Vignarajah after he moved, writing letters to his Ottawa address.
He applied for, and was granted, landed immigrant status in Canada under his real name after he told immigration authorities he faced persecutions from both the government and the Tigers, stating that he wanted to pursue "the peaceful life" in Canada; and though the Canadian Security Intelligence Service is alleged to have known about his history with the Tamil Tigers, it is believed they didn't inform the RCMP as they wanted to capitalise on his information. He settled in Toronto, where the vast majority of Canada's Tamil population had settled following the 1980s flood of refugees from Sinhalese violence.
Vignarajah worked at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Canada, while also employed by the RCMP; allegedly giving Canadians inside information on the Tigers, while also giving the Tigers information on the Canadians.
Tennakoon sent Vignarajah a series of letters, reminding him of the notes he had written to Canadian officials on his behalf and seeking assurance that the favours would be returned. He also asked Vignarajah whether he could bring back gifts for his family, including a washing machine, and a doll for his daughter, and a pair of "cheap" Timex watches and some CDs of Michael Jackson for his two sons.
Arrest.
Photos were soon shown to Canadian officials, showing Vignarajah posing with the bodies of dead Indian troops, implicating him with the Tigers.
On May 9 1996, police surrounded the bank where Vignarajah had been nominated as top employee, and arrested him on the basis he was a commander of the Tamil Tigers. A search of his house yielded a 1986 edition of the Shooter's Bible, recordings and transcripts of RCMP wiretaps into local Tamil residents, equipment believed to have been taken from the RCMP, and a copy of his resume on which he claimed to be an employee of "the RCMP Central Government Secret Intelligence Service".

Mohammad Yunus (politician)

Mohammad Yunus (4 May 1884—–13 May 1952) was the first Prime Minister (Premier) of Bihar province in British India. He Served for three months in 1937, during the state's first democratic election, however his minority government never faced the assembly as it had already resigned when the session begun. He was born in Penhara, a village of Patna, and went to the United Kingdom in the 1920s for higher education.
Biography.
Mr. Yunus was a prominent politician in early 20th century Bihar.
He was born in 1884 and the younger of two brothers.
Yunus, head of the Muslim Independent Party, was asked to form the government after the winning party in the 1937 elections declined to form a government. The legislative assembly passed many important resolutions during his short term as Prime Minister. During the second day of his term, Bihar Band (Hartal) and many agitators were arrested in front of his house ("Dar-ul-Mallik") at Fraser Road Patna. Then youth leader Jayaprakash Narayan harshly criticised Barrister's Yunus acceptance to the governor's invitation for formation of the government. His party (Congress Socialist Party) continued protests to the Muslim Independent Party government because it did not have a majority in the house.
As Muslim Independent Party was the party which got 20 seats from 40 seats reserved for Muslim and congress got only 4 Muslim seats, Muslim independent Party wanted to form an Alliance govt. with congress so that a better answer could be given to Muslim League that Hindu and Muslims, these two biggest religious majorities could exist with equal dignity and rights but congress refused to Barrister Yunus's brilliant proposal and did it best that formed the government alone. Congress which was having just 4 Muslim Members assembly out of 40 didn't showed any respect of Muslim mandate which was given to Muslim independent party in Bihar. Same situation aroses in West Bengal. Which ultimately resulted in partition of India. All these records are given in the diary of Barrister Yasin Yunus who was elder son and Political secretary of his father. The diary was later with Mohammad Yaqub Yunus, younger son of Barrister Yunus and Founder president of Bihar Muslim Majlise-e-Mushawarat Which is now with Baber Yunus (Director, Yunus Construction Pvt. Ltd. and son of Late Yaqub Yunus).After his minority government fell, the first Congress Ministry (led by Premier Sri Krishna Singh and Dr. A.N. Sinha as deputy premier) came to existence.
His elder son Barrister Moahammad Yasin Yunus, who inherited his legacy in judicial field and kept himself away from politics, died in 1947 aged 40 years, as standing counsel of Govt. of Bihar. His younger son, Mohammad Yaqub Yunus (founder president of Bihar Muslim Majlis Mushawarat), inherited most of his political and commercial legacy. His house, Dar-ul-Mallik, part of which later converted into Grand Hotel and in another Part oriental Bank was situated, which was later demolished in late 1990s. The Grand Apartment now stands in its place, built by his grandson, Baber Yunus, who runs the Yunus Construction Company in Patna.

Formed Muslim Independent Party in 1936 with the help of Maulana Abul Mohasin Sajjad (Founder of Imarat-e- Sharia, Bihar) and became its Founder President. Avoided all the efforts and persuasions of Mohammad Ali Jinnah to merge the Party with Muslim League before 1937 election.

His government had Abdul Wahab Khan as revenue Minister, Kumar Ajit Singh Deo as L.S.G. minister and Babu Guru Sahay Lal as River Development Minister. He also offered a ministerial position to lure Jagjivan Ram, who declined due to pressure from congress leadership for not joining the Government.
Qazi Sahab who was Nazim of Imarat-e-Sharia at that time and was also an important leader of Muslim independent party was having a divided opinion over formation of government but Barrister Yunus was firm on forming government because forming a government without giving participation to a party which was representing the second largest majority of the country was a narrow minded approach of congress leaders which could lead to a serious divide between these two communities which we saw in 1947 that congress this rigidity divided the country in two parts.

And very next day after refusal of Maulana, Mahamaya Prasad himself accepted the proposal from the party and became M.L.C.. Mohammad Yunus actively helped Kriplani and Mahamaya Prasad in formation of the party.

Hydra Technologies

Hydra Technologies is a Mexican firm dedicated to the design and development of unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance operations and aircraft avionics. The company has one hundred employees and as of mid-2008 has two operational models, the S4 Ehécatl and the E1 Gavilán.
Operations.
The S4 Ehécatl and E1 Gavilán are used in Mexico for ecological supervision, civilian protection, surveillance and the War on Drugs. The State of Jalisco uses them for detection of polluting sources in Río Grande de Santiago and for surveillance over Guadalajara in search for flooding-sensitive zones. They are also used by other countries.
S4 Ehécatl.
Development of the Hydra Technologies Ehécatl began in 2002 as a joint effort between the Government of Mexico, the Financial Sector, and Mexican academic and scientific institutions. Its main function is to provide security and surveillance capabilities in support of the Armed Forces, as well as civilian protection in hazardous situations. According to the manufacturer, the drone "observes what happens by land or sea. Because of its unmanned nature, it can enter dangerous zones being undetected" and is "an effective solution of the border problems between the U.S. and Mexico."
The S4 Ehécatl has a complex electronic system designed to provide up to eight hours of autonomous flight in either daytime or nighttime conditions. It is controlled from a mobile central facility installed in a specially-equipped three-man ground vehicle. Apart from an American-made FLIR thermal video system, all of the craft's components are designed, developed and manufactured in-house.
E1 Gavilán.
The Hydra Technologies Gavilán is a miniature UAV with ninety minutes of flight autonomy, controlled by a single user through a portable GCS. As the S4 Ehécatl, the E1 Gavilán is the result of a joint effort of the institutions mentioned above and is also equipped with a FLIR thermal video system for nighttime operation. It was presented on June 10 in San Diego, California, in AUVSI's Unmanned Systems North America 2008, an important event for this particular industry. The european debut took place on July 14 of the same year at the Farnborough Airshow.
In development.
, the company has other models in process of design, the S5 Cuculcán and the G1 Guerrero. The S5 Cuculcán will be able to fly for up to sixteen hours and provide a portable data recovery system, there is not much information on the G1 Guerrero yet.

Kappa1 Apodis

Kappa1 Apodis is the Bayer designation for a binary star system in the southern circumpolar constellation of Apus. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located roughly from Earth. The combined apparent visual magnitude of the system is 5.52, indicating that this is a faint, naked eye star that can be viewed in dark suburban skies.
This is a spectroscopic binary system with an orbital period of 0.6 days. The combined spectrum matches a stellar classification of B1npe. The 'e' suffix indicates that this is a Be star with emission lines in the spectrum. An 'n' means that the absorption lines in the spectrum are broadened from the Doppler effect as a result of rapid rotation. Finally, the 'p' shows some peculiarity in the spectrum. It is classified as a Gamma Cassiopeiae type variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude +5.43 to +5.61.
This is a runaway star with a peculiar velocity of . Because it is a binary star system, it was most likely not turned into a runaway system as the result of a supernova explosion. A companion star is a 12th magnitude orange K-type subgiant located at an angular separation of 27 arcseconds.

List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes

This is a list of costliest Atlantic hurricanes. Hurricanes, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are tropical cyclones—a warm-core, non-frontal synoptic-scale cyclone, originating over tropical or subtropical waters with organized deep convection and a closed surface wind circulation about a well-defined center—in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, or eastern Pacific, in which the maximum 1-minute sustained surface wind exceeds 64 kts (74 mph) or greater. The hurricanes on the list below depict the severity of the damage the system has caused. Typically, if a hurricane has caused significant damage to a particular location, it is requested to be retired by the region the system affected. The costliest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic was Hurricane Katrina, which struck the coastline of Louisiana in August 2005, causing $108 billion (2005 USD) in property damage. The most recent, costliest hurricane was Hurricane Sandy, which struck the coastlines of Puerto Rico, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, and New England causing $68 billion in total cost (2012 USD) in late October 2012.
A majority of the costliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history have peaked as major hurricanes. However, weaker tropical cyclones can still cause widespread damage. Both tropical storms Allison in 2001 and Matthew in 2010 have caused over a billion in damage; the former of which accounted for a higher damage total. Due to their excessive damage, the names of tropical cyclones accruing over $1 billion in damage are often retired by the World Meteorological Organization. However, this is not always the case. Hurricane Juan in 1985 was the first hurricane to cause over a billion in damage and not be retired; its name was retired on a later usage in 2003 that did not cause over a billion in damage. Since Juan, five tropical cyclones that caused over a billion in damage were not retired, the most recent of which being Hurricane Isaac in 2012. All other 39 Atlantic hurricanes to have caused as much damage have had their names retired.
The first hurricane to cause over $1 billion in damage was Hurricane Betsy in 1965, which caused much of its damage in southeastern Louisiana. Four years later, Hurricane Camille slightly exceeded Betsy's damage total after affecting similar regions, becoming the second tropical cyclone to cause as much damage. After the 1960s, each decade saw an increase in tropical cyclones causing at least a billion in damage over the last, due to increasing urban development and population. In the 1970s, four hurricanes caused over a billion in damage; the costliest of which was Hurricane Frederic, which caused $2.3 billion in damage, particularly in the Southeastern United States. The following decade featured seven hurricanes causing in excess of a billion in damage. In the 1990s, nine tropical cyclones accrued more than a billion in damage. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 greatly exceeded the damage figure of any preceding tropical cyclone after causing $26.5 billion in damage, mostly in South Florida. Seventeen tropical cyclones in the 2000s caused in excess of $1 billion in damage. Both 2004 and 2005 seasons had five billion-dollar hurricanes apiece, the most of any season on record. Hurricane Ivan caused at least a billion in damage in three separate countries. Thus far in the 2010s, six tropical cyclones have amounted to over $1 billion in damage.
Overall costliest.
This list ranks tropical cyclones within the Atlantic that have accrued at least US$1 billion in damage, based on their uninflated damage totals.

USS Skywatcher (AGR-3)

USS "Skywatcher" (YAGR-3/AGR-3) was a "Guardian"-class radar picket ship acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1954. She was converted into a radar picket ship and assigned to radar picket duty in the North Atlantic Ocean as part of the Distant Early Warning Line.
Built in Panama City, Florida.
"Skywatcher" (YAGR-3) was laid down on 30 November 1944 by the J. A. Jones Co., Panama City, Florida, as the "Rafael R. Rivera" (MC hull 2337), U.S. Maritime Administration type ZEC2C5; launched on 16 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Evelyn Anderson; acquired by the Navy on 20 September 1954; and commissioned on 29 March 1955, Lt. Cdr. John Anto in command.
Radar patrol duty.
"Skywatcher" was operated by the States Marine Corporation as "Rafael R. Rivera". She was acquired by the Navy and converted at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Norfolk, Virginia, into an ocean station radar ship. In July 1955, she assumed her first duties in the Contiguous Radar Coverage System of the United States while operating out of Newport, Rhode Island.
In September 1958, the ship's designation was changed from "YAGR-3" to radar picket ship "AGR-3". Her home port was changed to Davisville, Rhode Island, and she operated from there until early 1965 with Radar Picket Squadron 2, spending over 50 percent of her time on her assigned picket station.
Decommissioning.
In March 1965, "Skywatcher" was placed in reserve, out of commission, and struck from the Navy List on 1 April. She was sold on 23 December 1970 to Daewood Corp., Ltd., of Karachi, Pakistan, and scrapped.

Philippe de Rémi (died 1265)

Philippe de Rémi (Old French: "Phelipe de Remi") (1210–1265) was an Old French poet and trouvère from Picardy, and the bailli of the Gâtinais from 1237 to at least 1249. He was also the father of Philippe de Beaumanoir, the famous jurist, by his wife Marie. 
Biography.
By 1255 Philippe was a knight ("chevalier") and the sire (or seigneur) of Beaumanoir. In 1257 he served at the court of the Countess of Artois, Amicie de Courtenay, to arbitrate a dispute between the house of Haute-Avesnes and Guillaume de Hesdigneul. He remained at the court of Artois until 1259, when he retired to his estate at Remy. He died there in 1265. Besides his middle child, Philippe, he left an elder son, Girard (Gérard), who succeeded him as sire, and a daughter, Péronelle, his children by first wife, Marie. He also left behind his second wife, Alice de Bailleul, whom he had married by 1262 and who was living in 1267. 
Henri Léonard Bordier first identified the poet with the jurist in 1868. In 1894 this was challenged by V. Zeidler, who argued that "Jehan et Blonde" was the basis for the German poem "Willehalm von Orlens" by Rudolf von Ems, composed in 1242. This necessitated identifying poet with bailli. This was widely discredited until 1981, when Bernard Gicquel rejuvenated the hypothesis that aspects of "Willehalm" were derived from "Jehan" and from the hastilude sequence at Ressons in "La Manekine". R.-H. Bautier follows Gicquel, but revises the biography of the father slightly. According to him, Alice was Philippe's wife as early as 1252 and the younger Philippe was born between then and 1254. He suggests that Philippe's romances were composed while he was bailli and that the poems were written between 1250 and 1262 (or 1265). Jean Dufournet and Marie-Madaleine Castellani also follow Gicquel. Sylvie Lécuyer in her edition of "Jehan et Blonde" (Paris, 1984), refused to use "Philippe de Beaumanoir" of the author in order to avoid linking him with the jurist, his son.
Poetry.
Philippe wrote some 20,000 verses of poems and two romances, "La Manekine" and "Jehan et Blonde". All of his work is preserved in B.N., f. fr. 1588, an early fourteenth-century manuscript from Amiens or Vermandois. There are eleven "chansons" outside of this manuscript with Alfred Jeanroy attributed to him. 
Among his poem is a unique "salut d'amour", one of only four such pieces with refrains, and the only one with an identified author. It begins "Douce amie, salus vous mande" and includes eight refrains. It has been called a "salut à refrains" analogous to a "chanson avec des refrains". 
Among Philippe's most studied works are his nonsense poems called "Fatrasies" and "Oiseuses". His courtly love poetry has been under-studied.

Bastion (Nanaimo)

The Bastion, also known as the Nanaimo Bastion, is an historic octagonal shaped bastion or fortification located at 98 Front Street in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada. The Hudson's Bay Company, which then held a royal lease on all of what was then the Colony of Vancouver Island, built it between 1853 and 1855 to defend its coal mining operations in Nanaimo. Square logs were used for the walls of the three-storey building whose third floor extends out over the lower floors. It has been called "Nanaimo's premier landmark", because of its shape and its "high visibility from both land and sea." In 1891 and again in 1979 it was moved a short distance for historic preservation purposes.
During the Summer of 2010, the Bastion was torn apart, to renew rotting boards, and stabilizing steel beams. The director of the event said that they were 'Making a historic movement'.
On December 12, 1985, the city of Nanaimo designated it a local heritage site. Today the Bastion is under the supervision of the Nanaimo District Museum and is open to visitors during the summer. The Nanaimo Museum has heritage interpreters in costume on-site, and also hosts a daily cannon firing at noon during the summer months.

Delaware State Hornets football

The Delaware State University Hornets football team plays at 7,193-seat Alumni Stadium located in Dover, Delaware. The facility opened in 1957 as a multi-purpose for football, and track and field. The Hornets compete in Division I FCS, and are full-members of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. They are a four-time conference champion and made their first-ever FCS playoff appearance in 2007. As of February 3, 2011, Kermit Blount has been hired as Head Football Coach.
History.
1980s.
Portland State Embarrassment.
On November 9, 1980, Delaware State took on QB Neil Lomax and the Portland State Vikings and were defeated 105-0 in the most lopsided loss in Division I-AA Football history. This was marked as the low point for the team and with the help of new coach Joe Purzycki the Hornets rebuilt their program. He was hired as Delaware State's head coach in 1981, and compiled a 21-21-1 overall record, including a 15-5-1 mark in his last two seasons. Bill Collick, who was Purzycki's defensive coordinator, took over the program in 1985. He led the Hornets to the team's first MEAC championship in his first season.
2000s.
Al Lavan Era.
After 2003's 1-10 debacle, Delaware State hired Alton "Al" Lavan as their new head football coach with the task of rebuilding the program once again. When Lavan was hired as head coach of the Hornets in January 2004, he promised to bring championship football back to Delaware State.
In 2007, the promise became reality.
Last season, he led the Hornets to a school-record 10 wins, their first Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) championship since 1991 and first ever appearance in the NCAA playoffs. In addition, the 2007 Hornets were ranked as high as No. 10 in the weekly SportsNetwork Football Championship Subdivision poll and were No. 15 in the final poll.
Delaware State was recognized as 2007 American Sports Wire Division I Black College National Champions and No. 2 in the final Sheridan Broadcast Network poll of Historically Black College & University teams.
Lavan was honored as the 2007 Pigskin Club of Washington, D.C., MEAC Coach-of-the-Year and Football Championship Subdivision Region II Coach-of-the-Year.
He was second in the voting for the 2007 Eddie Robinson Award, recognizing the top Football Championship Subdivision coach, and was awarded the 2008 Making A Difference Award by the DSU Alumni Association.
The Fort Pierce, Fla., native was also selected as head coach for the 2008 American Heritage Bowl/Navy-Marine Corps All-Star Classic in San Clemente, Calif. He guided the Northeast All-Stars to a 24-7 victory in the contest.
In four seasons at DSU, Lavan has posted an overall record of 29-16, including a 24-7 mark in MEAC contests. He has led the team to winning records in each of the last three seasons. In the three years prior to his arrival, the Hornets were 10-24 overall and 6-17 in the league. Delaware State had just one winning season in the eight years before Lavan took the job.
Lavan has 31-17 career record as a head coach, including a 2-1 mark during an interim stint at Eastern Michigan in 2003.
In 2006, the Hornets were 8-3 overall and 6-2 in the MEAC. It marked the first time that DSU posted back-to-back winning seasons since 1994-95, while the eight wins were the most by the team since 1991. Delaware State also appeared in the SportsNetwork Division I-AA Top 25 poll for the first time since 1992, coming in at No. 23 in week ten.
Lavan’s 2005 squad posted the Hornets’ first winning season since 2000. The team was 7-4 overall, and third in the MEAC with a 6-2 record. Delaware State was picked to finish sixth in the 2005 pre-season MEAC poll. The 2005 season also marked the first time since 1985 that the Hornets posted an undefeated record at home (5-0).
During his first season at Delaware State in 2004, Lavan led the Hornets to a 4-7 overall record and a 4-3 mark in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), DSU’s first winning record in conference play since 2000.
The year before Lavan’s arrival, the Hornets lost their first nine games en route to a 1-10 overall record.
The highlight of the 2004 season was Lavan’s first DSU victory, a 28-23 upset of eventual MEAC champ Hampton, the Pirates ‘only loss in a 10-1 regular season.
More than the on-field improvement, Lavan has brought a change of attitude to the program.
In addition to installing the first comprehensive strength and conditioning program in team history, he spearheaded changes in the team’s academic, recruiting, practice and discipline policies. The team is also benefiting from new audio/visual and computer equipment, thanks to a generous donation from prominent alumni spurred by Lavan’s outreach efforts to university supporters.
Lavan has also demonstrated concern for his players by initiating a program to bring local and nationally recognized speakers before the team to share their stories. Among the prominent individuals offering words of wisdom are former Hornet offensive lineman Matt Horace, currently an agent with the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; Joe Purzycki, former DSU head football coach and current bank executive; former pro quarterback and current NFL executive James Harris; and former Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker.
The team’s commitment to public service is also a Lavan priority. The past four years, the Hornets have hosted holiday parties for area foster children, participated in reading programs at local schools, and provided mentoring services.
Lavan has also gained popularity around campus by "encouraging" his players to support other DSU sports teams. It is not uncommon to see Lavan and his troops cheering on the Hornets’ volleyball, softball or basketball teams during home games.
All of the above has made Lavan a popular guest on the banquet and speaking circuit during his short time in Delaware.
Lavan brought more than 30 years of professional and collegiate coaching experience to Delaware State.
Prior to accepting the Delaware State position, Lavan served for two seasons as an assistant coach at Eastern Michigan University. He was promoted to assistant head coach for the 2003 football season, and upon the late-season firing of then-head coach Jeff Woodruff, Lavan was named interim head coach. After he took over the 1-8 team, Eastern Michigan won two of its final three games.
In more than 18 years as a NFL assistant, Lavan’s resume’ includes stints with the Atlanta Falcons, Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, Baltimore Ravens, and the Kansas City Chiefs.
He was a member of George Seifert’s 1990 Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers’ coaching staff. That team included former Delaware State University standout John Taylor, who caught a touchdown pass in the 49ers’ 55-10 win over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV.
In Dallas, Lavan worked under Hall of Fame head coach Tom Landry. He helped Cowboy running backs Tony Dorsett and Herschel Walker combine for six 1000-yard seasons.
He helped lead Dallas to division titles in 1981 and ’85, and wild card playoff berths in 1980 and ’83.
Lavan has also served as position coach for NFL all stars Roger Craig, Priest Holmes, Tom Rathman, Ernest Byner, Robert Newhouse and Bam Morris.
Lavan’s collegiate coaching tenure includes stops at Colorado State, Louisville, Iowa State, Georgia Tech, Stanford, and Washington.
He helped guide Georgia Tech to the 1978 Peach Bowl, and Washington to the 1993 Rose Bowl and 1995 Sun Bowl.
After three straight losing seasons, Al Lavan was fired from Delaware State on December 2, 2010.
Hornets vs Blue Hens Controversy.
The most controversial aspect of the DSU football program was the fact that it had never been scheduled by potential instate rival University of Delaware for a regular season game. It was highly unusual for two state universities that play on the same athletic tier to not play one another, especially schools that are less than one hour's drive away from campus. Critics charged that this had to do with the fact that Delaware State is a Historically Black College. Furthermore, supporters of a game between DSU and UD claimed that it would be akin to other in-state college rivalries and would be good for the state. In response to the charges of racism on UD's part, their supporters pointed out that Delaware had scheduled and played regular season games against several other HBCUs such as Morgan State and North Carolina A&T. UD supporters also claimed that DSU's team was not as strong as the Blue Hens, and that UD's program had made commitments to other universities that they had to fulfill. Finally, UD supporters also noted the fact that the two colleges routinely meet in sports other than football.
This controversy was laid to rest when University of Delaware and Delaware State University met on the football field for the first time on November 23, 2007 in Newark, DE in the first round of the NCAA FCS Playoffs. The Fightin' Blue Hens defeated the Hornets 44-7 in front of an attedance of 19,765, the largest playoff crowd in Delaware Stadium history. In 2009, the teams began playing each other during the regular season. With the exception of 2010, the game has been played annually, with each of these games played at Delaware Stadium on the UD campus in Newark. Delaware has won all four regular season meetings to date (2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013) by an average of 25 points per game, including the most recent meeting 42-21 on September 7, 2013. The next meeting is scheduled for September 6, 2014. Due to the one-sided nature of the contests in the manufactured rivalry, officials from both schools are unsure of whether the game will continue to be played after the contract expires with the 2014 game.

Long Gully Wind Farm

Long Gully Wind Farm is a proposed wind farm in Wellington, New Zealand. Long Gully is an area adjacent to the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary.
The proposal involved using turbines manufactured by the New Zealand company Windflow Technology Limited. In 2008, Windflow Technology took on the overall management of the project. 
Windflow Technology announced in 2009 that Wellington City Council had granted resource consents for the wind farm. Two appeals against the consent were lodged and according to Windflow were resolved in principle by mid-2010.
Mighty River Power was involved in early development of the proposal until 2010. In late 2010, the proposed wind farm was on hold as Windflow Technology did not want to pursue the proposal in the short-term due to high wholesale electricity prices.

Whatcha Think About That

"Whatcha Think About That" is a song recorded by American girl group the The Pussycat Dolls from their second studio album, "Doll Domination" (2008). Produced by Esther Dean, Melissa Elliott, Mickael Furnon, Jamal Jones and Jason Perry. It was released as the third single in the United Kingdom and France and second in the United States. The song has bhangra-style beats with R&B elements. The song received mixed reviews, with critics stating that it was "disappointing after the hyperactive pop brilliance of 'When I Grow Up'."
The song didn't manage to get that much attention after their two previous single. In the United States it didn't manage to chart on "Hot 100". However, the song was a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart, while in the neighboring Republic of Ireland it peaked at number twelve on the Irish Singles Chart. The accompanying burlesque-themed music video portrayed the Dolls in different routines including dancing on a rotating platform and on a horizontal bar. They performed the song three times on television including on the seventh season of "Dancing with the Stars" along with Missy Elliott and on the British daytime television show, "This Morning".
Background.
Following the commercial success of "PCD" (2005), lead vocalist Nicole Scherzinger opted to pursue in her solo career, and began to work on her own solo album under the title, "Her Name is Nicole". However due to poor lack of success of her singles, Scherzinger focused back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album, "Doll Domination".
"Whatcha Think About That" was written by Ester Dean, Elliot and Jamal Jones who also produced the song. Mickael Furnon of the French rock group Mickey 3D received co-writing credits for the song, for its sample of "Je M'appelle Jane". Dean also handled the vocal production of the song along with Ron Fair. The Pussycat Dolls and Elliot's vocals were recorded in two separate studios at Zac Studio in Atlanta, Georgia and The Boiler Room Studio in Santa Monica, California by Mike “Angry” Eleoploulos, Tal Herzberg, Tony Terrebonne, Aubry "Big Juice" Delaine and Matt Wheeler with the assistance of Johnathan Merritt and Bryan Morton. The song was mixed by Dave Pensado and Jayson Joshua. Missy Elliot appears of The Goldmind Inc./Atlantic Records. On August 29, 2008 Rap-Up announced that the song would be released as the second single of "Doll Domination" and also unveiled the cover art. The song was available for digital download and was sent to contemporary hit radio on September 9.
Composition.
An album track of three minutes and forty-eight seconds, "Whatcha Think About That" is a midtempo, electropop song with R&B influences. A sample of "Je M'appelle Jane" by Jane Birkin runs throughout the song. The song is built around a distinctive bhangra-ish guitar riff and has a "spunky attitude". The song features resourceful vocals from Scherzinger. Maura of the website Idolator wrote that the song is a reminiscent of Whitney Houston's song "I'm Your Baby Tonight" (1990).
The song features three verses from Missy Elliott, who joins the Dolls for a "boy-baiting session". She uses brash rap and risqué lyrics in lines such as, "You ain't gonna get no more pussy... cat". In her lines, she references Katy Perry and her song "I Kissed a Girl" teasing, "Up in that club it's just me and my girls, play like Katy Perry kissing on girls." Samesame.com.au noted that Elliott's rapping is coherent with the Dolls’ signature style". Lyrically, the song is about a woman getting rid of her no-good-controlling-waste-of-space lover, while Jon Pareles of "New York Times" wrote that the song "proposes that her man stay home while she goes club hopping".
Nicole Scherzinger said that Missy Elliott " the Pussycat Dolls to a whole other level."
Reception.
Critical.
Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy gave the song three out five stars commenting, "song finds the pop troupe somewhere near the top of their game". Samesame.com.au called the song "sensational". "The Times" music reviewer Elan Priya included "Whatcha Think About That" along with "I Hate This Part" among the songs that have "distinct personality" in the album. He described Missy Elliott's rap, "cheeky". Bill Lamb of About.com included "Whatcha Think About That" among the songs the top tracks on "Doll Domination", namely tracks like "When I Grow Up", "Happily Never After", "In Person" and "Elevator". Vicki Lutas from BBC Radio 1 praised Missy Elliott's contribution to the song, complimenting the introduction. "Of course, the song's greatness isn't all down to Missy Elliott alone – the Dolls certainly give it life – but it's safe to say that she does make this song just that little bit more distinctive"
However, Nic Oliver in a review of "Doll Domination" from "MusicOMH" wrote, identikit urban beats, sleepwalking guest parts from Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott, and lyrics that might as well have been written by a sophomore student on a weekend bender for all the depth on offer. A critic from entertainment.ie echoed Oliver's comments writing, " lower[ed themselves to new levels of cheese with their contributions. In earlier review from Digital Spy, Nick Levine wrote that, " slightly disappointing after the hyperactive pop brilliance of 'When I Grow Up'". Spence D. of IGN agreed writing, "the cool electro shock ambiance and unloads a much more straight forward pop angle that's missing some of the futuro risqué elements that made the two prior songs ['When I Grow Up and 'Bottle Pop') so catchy." "Slant Magazine" music reviewer Sal Cinquemani did not favored the song calling it a "pure filler" despite the presence of Missy Elliott.
Chart performance.
In the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number thirty-six on the UK Singles Chart on February 1, 2009 ― for the week ending date February 7, 2009 ― replacing "I Hate This Part". On March 1, 2009 ― for the week ending date March 7, 2009 ― the song peaked at number nine. In Ireland the song peaked at number twelve on the Irish Singles Chart on February 12, 2009. In the European Hot 100 "Whatcha Think About That" peaked at number thirty-seven.
In the United States, "Whatcha Think About That" failed to make a chart appearance on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, but it peaked at number 8 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, a component chart which represents the 25 songs which failed to make an impact on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. On the Pop Songs chart the song debuted and peaked at number 70. In Canada, on the Canadian Hot 100 the song debuted and peaked at number sixty-six on September 27, 2008.
Music video.
The music video for "Whatcha Think About That" was filmed in September 9–10, 2008 in Los Angeles, with Diane Martel serving as the director. Melody Thornton spoke to Rap-Up about the concept of the video. "It's kinda like a throwback to the original Pussycat Dolls were we started out at Johnny Depp's Viper Room, and the whole burlesque-cabaret feel, and the choreography was very Fosse inspired and very stylized." Meanwhile Ashley Roberts said "it's very editorial in my mind. Lots of beauty, lighting, and mysterious set-ups". The "Daily Mail" commented, that the video "is set behind the scenes at a burlesque show" to lead the audiences to the feeling of "peeping Tom watching the Dolls get ready in their dressing room".
Synopsis.
The video starts with Missy Elliott singing her lines, and then switches to each of the Dolls singing a line of the song: Kimberly Wyatt, flexing her leg, then on a swing, Jessica Sutta popping gum; Thornton brushing her hair and Roberts puffing powder in her chest. The video centers on two plots: one shows the Dolls dressing for, and then actually performing, one of their famous Lounge Shows, clad in the exotic burlesque outfits for which they are known. After their introduction on the swing, the video cuts to scenes from the other storyline, where Scherzinger leaves behind her controlling partner, and goes out to have fun. She is shown turning a large key into a neon door, and steps out into the town, where she is joined by the other Dolls, and they walk the runway while singing the song's chorus. Returning to the other plot, the five girls are shown in lingerie in their dressing room, and the camera switches to Scherzinger as she sings the verse, and the other Dolls as they dress and apply make up. The remainder of the video focuses on the PCD burlesque show. The girls are shown on a rotating platform, then on a horizontal bar dancing and singing seductively in their vintage corsets and burlesque outfits. The scene changes, showing Elliott performing her rap, while the Dolls, dressed in seductive military outfits, perform a sexy army dance, accentuated by salutes and military steps. At the climax, the Dolls appear dressed in modern burlesque outfits, dancing intricately on a stage and Thornton singing the ad-libs. The video ends with Elliott performing her last lines, surrounded by the girls. This is also crosscut with scenes showing the silhouette of the Dolls as they continue to dance. Finally, the girls are again shown on swings, with Scherzinger singing the song's last lines.
Reception.
The British tabloid newspaper "Daily Mail" commented that "promo for the upcoming single 'Whatcha Think About That', frontwoman Scherzinger and her fellow Dolls perform their high-energy dance moves in a series of sexy lingerie." Nadia Mendoza from fellow UK newspaper "The Sun" agreed, particularly commenting on the outfits and the dance. A reviewer from Rap-Up wrote that "The Pussycat Dolls turn up the heat in their smolderin’ burlesque-inspired clip." MTV News compared the music video of "Whatcha Think About That" to Danity Kane's "Bad Girls", concluding: "We like the Dolls' video better, but prefer the vocal stylings of [Danity Kane for the simple reason that their song sounds less like a lesson in robotics and more like actual singing."
Live performances.
The Pussycat Dolls first performed "Whatcha Think About That" on October 28, 2008 on "Dancing with the Stars". "Rap-Up" commented about their performance. "The girls sounded a mess here. On the bright side, it looks like Missy lost some weight." The song was also performed throughout their second headlining tour, Doll Domination Tour.

Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt

Joachim Ernest of Anhalt (21 October 1536 – 6 December 1586), was a German prince of the House of Ascania, ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst from 1551, and from 1570 sole ruler of all the Anhalt lands.
Life.
Early life.
Joachim Ernest was born in Dessau on 21 October 1536 as the second son of John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his wife Margaret, daughter of Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg. He received an extensive education under the supervision of his father. On 1 February 1549, just thirteen years of age, he was officially admitted to the University of Wittenberg, where, among others, he studied with the theologian Georg Helt.
Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst.
In 1550, after the death of his father, he inherited Anhalt-Zerbst along with his older brother Karl I and his younger brother Bernhard VII.
The death of his uncle George III without male heirs permitted him and his brothers, Karl I and Bernhard VII, to inherit Anhalt-Plötzkau in 1553, while the death of his uncle Joachim I permitted him and his surviving brother Bernhard VII to inherit Anhalt-Dessau in 1561. In 1562 his cousin Wolfgang abdicated Anhalt-Köthen in his favor.
Marriages.
In Barby on 3 March 1560 Joachim Ernest married Agnes (b. Barby, 23 June 1540 – d. Bernburg, 27 November 1569), daughter of Wolfgang I, Count of Barby-Mühlingen. They had six children.
In Stuttgart on 9 January 1571 Joachim Ernest married for a second time to Eleonore (b. Tübingen, 22 March 1552 – d. Schloss Lichtenberg, 12 January 1618), daughter of Christoph, Duke of Württemberg. They had ten children.
Sole ruler of Anhalt.
In 1570 the death of his last surviving brother, Bernhard VII, left him as sole ruler of all the Anhalt states, which were finally unified for the first time since their first partition in 1252. Joachim Ernest made Dessau the seat of his government.
Joachim Ernest was a typical Renaissance monarch who generously supported the arts and culture. He sent his sons with their tutors on educational journeys across Europe. Also, he ordered the son of his chancellor, Tobias Hübner, to create a description of the famous knight's games (German: "Ritterspiele") that took place at the Dessau court.
In 1572 he created in the Regional Legal Code of Anhalt (German: "Landesverordnung Anhalts") and in 1582 he founded the Francisceum High School (German: "Gymnasium Francisceum") in Zerbst. He was a fervent supporter of the Reformation and the Huguenots.
Death and succession.
Prince Joachim Ernest died in Dessau on 6 December 1586. Since succession in the territories of Anhalt was not governed by the rules of primogeniture, Joachim Ernest's seven sons shared rule of the territories of Anhalt until 1603, when the five surviving sons divided their lands among themselves.

The Recruiting Serjeant

The Recruiting Serjeant is a burletta by composer Charles Dibdin and playwright Isaac Bickerstaff. It premièred on 20 July 1770 at Ranelagh Gardens, London.
Synopsis.
A recruiting sergeant comes to a village seeking out new recruits. A countryman, Joe, living with his wife and mother, hears his stirring cry, and decides to enlist. The two women in his life seek to dissuade him, and follow him in when he meets with the sergeant. The sergeant is pleased to find a recruit, but Joe's mother begins cursing the sergeant out for trying to take her son away.
This too fails to dissuade either of them. The mother fetches his children from the house, and appeals to Joe not to leave them, and thus risk all of them ending up in the workhouse. The sergeant starts to sign the man on, but Joe hesitates, asking for information about army life. They talk about women's love of the uniform, and when he asks about battles, sergeant explains "what a charming thing's a battle", cheerily describing everyone's gory death. ("Heads, and limbs, and bullets flying / Then the groans of soldiers dying...")
This terrifies the women, but Joe simply asks whether it's likely he himself will lose his head or limbs. "Not if you've good luck", says the sergeant. Joe begins to have second thoughts at this – he had wished to see a battle, but he has decided the sergeant's description of it is quite sufficient. His wife and mother are delighted – and then Joe explains the whole thing was revenge upon his wife for nagging him the night before when he wanted to go to the alehouse. She promises not to do so again, and they reconcile. The play ends with the sergeant buying Joe a drink, and all toasting King George.

Some of the issues tie in with "Salvation Run".
A trade paperback was released on November 19, 2008.
Plot.
A group of people hidden in the shadows targets Man-Bat with their hi-tech gadgetry and take him captive. Talking amongst themselves, they discuss what their next target will be. At Gotham City's Police headquarters, Commissioner Gordon lights the Bat-Signal, but only Robin answers the call. Gordon tells him about the recent upsurge in gang-related violence. Dozens of would-be crime lords are trying to fill the vacancy created by the death of Black Mask. Meanwhile, Batman infiltrates the Iceberg Lounge in the guise of henchman Matches Malone. He wants to keep an eye on the Penguin's recent activities. He knows that the Penguin is projecting the image of a legitimate businessman, but he suspects that Penguin may also be the ringleader behind an "underground railroad" for supervillains. As the Penguin conducts his affairs, Two-Face enters the club and wants in on his underground railroad project. Penguin tells him to meet him later after hours. Elsewhere, Nightwing and Alfred Pennyworth investigate another nightclub where wagers are placed on hero/villain battle outcomes. Nightwing raids the gambling den and takes down all of the goons. He is surprised however by the hi-tech weaponry that these low level thugs now have access to. At Giovanni's Ristorante, the leaders of two of Gotham's more powerful criminal gangs, the Galantes and the Odessas, meet to discuss territory. Their meeting is interrupted by Tobias Whale who announces his intention of taking control of Gotham's underworld. Later, the Penguin holds a meeting with several of Gotham's most notorious villains including Hugo Strange, Two-Face, Scarecrow and Mad Hatter. Matches Malone spies on the meeting from behind a darkened alcove. Suddenly, the Suicide Squad bursts into the room and attacks the assemblage of villains. Bane knocks Matches Malone out with a single punch.
It is revealed that Penguin is involved with the Suicide Squad, and that he set up the other villains to gain the favor of the Squad. Scarecrow, who has recently reconsidered his decision to abandon his fear toxins, gasses Bronze Tiger and escapes to warn Ventriloquist II. However, when the Ventriloquist and her gang accuse Scarecrow of being Suicide Squad's snitch and then lead an assault on the Iceberg Lounge, Scarecrow leads them into a trap by Tobias Whale. Whale then betrays him, leaving him beaten and tied-up, though alive (but barely), as a sign to all "masks" that they are not welcome in Whale's new vision of Gotham. Batman as Matches Malone is in Blackgate Penitentiary and ends up being targeted by Victor Zsasz. Meanwhile, the Riddler investigates Penguin's "underground railroad."
Matches Malone ends up in a fight with Zsasz while Penguin tries to negotiate with Tobias Whale. Robin and Oracle try to figure out what is going on in the criminal underground when they are suddenly attacked by Spoiler.
Batman as Matches Malone escapes from the Penitentiary's infirmary and runs into Great White Shark while Scarecrow (still injured) takes revenge on those that have wronged him. Tobias Whale sends a message to Gotham City Police telling them not to interfere.
It is discovered that Johnny Denetto is the one who drove Tobias Whale out of Metropolis and into Gotham City. Bruce/Matches then finds out who is orchestrating his death.
Bruce/Matches learns how Great White Shark got from Arkham Asylum to Blackgate Penitentiary. Tobias Whale and Penguin are both assembling armies. Spoiler is seemingly working with the Penguin to take care of Johnny "Stitches" Denetto of Intergang. Penguin and Spoiler have assembled gangs like the Bat Killers, the Dead End Boys, the Femme Fatales, the Five Points Gang, the L.O.D., and the New Rogues. As Bruce/Matches escapes Blackgate Penitentiary, Nightwing as "Freddie Dinardo" has a run-in with Vigilante.
Penguin and Tobias Whale are currently fighting each other as Robin, Huntress, Batgirl, and Wildcat IV get involved. Even though Penguin gets the upper hand, Tobias Whale reluctantly calls a truce with him in order to stop Johnny "Stitches" Denetto and Intergang. Batman arrives just in time to save Nightwing from Vigilante.
As Batman continues his fight with Vigilante, Johnny "Stitches" Denetto sends Penguin a package containing Riddler's glasses and Mr. Jessup's cut-up body. When Penguin has a talk with Johnny, he mentions that Tobias Whale isn't on "Penguin's side" anymore. Johnny also mentions that he has threatened the families of those fighting on Penguin's side and tells Penguin that he is giving him a day to get out of town.
When Penguin and Riddler are talking in the Iceberg Lounge, members of Intergang attack. Things weren't looking good for the Penguin until Batman arrives and comes to his rescue. However, Batman isn't here just to save his life. He lets Penguin know that he owns him now and that he will report everything to Batman concerning Intergang and what's going on in Gotham, to which Penguin was actually quite happy to agree.

José Salomón Rondón

José Salomón Rondón Giménez (born 16 September 1989) is a Venezuelan professional footballer who plays for Zenit in the Russian Premier League, as a striker.
Club career.
Early years / Las Palmas.
Born in Caracas, the son of prolific Charlton Athletic striker Alexander Rondón, Venezuela Rondón made his debut in the Venezuelan first division at the age of 17, appearing for Aragua FC against Carabobo FC on 8 October 2006. On 8 April of the following year he scored his first goal(s) for the club, in a 2–2 draw against Caracas FC.
In the summer of 2008 Rondón was signed by UD Las Palmas in Spain, and made his debut on 16 August in a friendly game with FC Barcelona B. His first official appearance came on 4 October as the Canary Islands side faced Deportivo Alavés in a second division game; almost one year after his arrival, on 2 September 2009, he scored his first official goal, in a Copa del Rey match against Cádiz CF – becoming the youngest foreign player to ever score for the club, at the age of 19 years, 11 months and 17 days –and finished the 2009–10 season with ten goals in 36 games, as Las Palmas barely avoided relegation.
Málaga.
On 19 July 2010, Málaga CF signed Rondón for a record transfer fee of €3.5 million. He scored his first goal for the Andalusians exactly two months later, in a 1–2 home defeat against Sevilla FC in La Liga. Four days later, he opened the score in a 2–0 win at Getafe CF, adding a third the following week in a 2–3 home loss against Villarreal CF.
On 1 May 2011, Rondón contributed with one goal as Málaga came from behind at home to defeat Hércules CF 3–1. That was his 13th goal of the season, with which he surpassed the record of goals from a Venezuelan footballer in the Spanish top flight, previously held by Juan Arango; the team finally escaped relegation, with the player finishing as its top scorer.
Rondón started the 2011–12 campaign on the substitutes bench. He eventually beat competition from ageing Ruud van Nistelrooy, again finishing as Málaga's best scorer – this included goals in narrow home wins against RCD Espanyol (2–1) and Levante UD (1–0), and a brace against Rayo Vallecano (4–2 success, also at La Rosaleda Stadium).
Rubin Kazan.
In August 2012 Rondón signed for Russian Premier League team FC Rubin Kazan, for a reported fee of €10 million which made him the most expensive Venezuelan player in history. He made his league debut on the 12th in a 2–0 home win over FC Dynamo Moscow, and he scored his first goal against FC Terek Grozny on 1 September, albeit in a 1–2 home defeat.
Rondón made his first appearance in the UEFA Europa League against Inter Milan, and he scored once in a 2–2 group stage away draw, also playing the entire match. In the second game between the two sides he netted a brace in the final three minutes, helping his team to a 3–0 win.
On 10 March 2013, following the winter break in the Russian Premier League, Rondón scored the only goal of the game as Rubin claimed a home victory over reigning champions Zenit St. Petersburg. In continental competition, he opened up the scoring in the 100th minute of the round-of-16 clash against Levante UD, latching on to a cross from Bibras Natkho as the hosts won it 2–0 (also the aggregate score). 
On 19 April Rondón opened the scoring for Rubin, who could only manage a 1–1 draw at relegation-threatened FC Amkar Perm. In the club's next league match, against PFC CSKA Moscow, he netted the first goal in a 2–0 victory over the league leaders and eventual champions.
On 1 September 2013, Rondón scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win against recently promoted FC Ural Sverdlovsk Oblast.
Zenit Saint Petersburg.
On 31 January 2014 he joined fellow Russian Premier League club Zenit Saint Petersburg. Rondón made his debut for his new club in the Champions League Round of 16 first-leg clash with Borussia Dortmund on 25 February 2014.
International career.
Rondón appeared for the Venezuelan under-20s in the 2009 FIFA World Cup in Egypt. He scored four times during the competition – as teammate Yonathan del Valle, with both netting hat-tricks in the 8–0 group stage routing of Tahiti – as the South Americans managed to qualify to the round-of-16.
Previously, on 3 February 2008 (aged only 18), Rondón made his debut for the senior team, in a friendly with Haiti, scoring his first international goal on 23 March against El Salvador (another exhibition match, another 1–0 win).

Three Dog Night discography

Three Dog Night's original recordings were released by ABC Dunhill Records (except for 1983's "It's A Jungle"). In 1973, executives at ABC Dunhill (Jay Lasker is usually blamed) decided to discard all of their multi-track recordings and mono masters to save storage space in a cost-cutting measure. As a result, all re-issues on CD have been remastered using album masters (sometimes second or third generation tape) which often results in an inferior sound when compared to other catalogs of the era.

<doc id="19083438" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19083438" title="WolfBlock">
WolfBlock

WolfBlock LLP (formerly Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen) was a large U.S. law firm and lobbying group based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The National Law Journal ranked WolfBlock the 149th largest firm in the United States, and the 10th largest in Philadelphia, by number of attorneys. The firm was best known for its lobbying and government relations practice, as well as for being one of the oldest law firms in Philadelphia.
History.
WolfBlock was founded in 1903 by Horace Stern and Morris Wolf. Stern would go on to work for the United States Department of War and would go on to serve as Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. One of the firm's first major clients was the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, one of the predecessors of SEPTA. The firm gradually expanded, and after World War II, acquired several smaller firms, becoming a sizable regional firm.
In 2002 the firm established a lobbying subsidiary, WolfBlock Government Relations L.P., in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The subsidiary was expanded into Washington D.C. the following year.
Collapse.
Failed merger attempt.
WolfBlock's management had planned a merger with the 500+ lawyer Miami, Florida-based law firm of Akerman Senterfitt, which would have created a single 800-lawyer firm. But on 7 August 2008, the two firms released a joint statement explaining that the merger had been put on hold due to “a client conflict that cannot be discussed publicly”.
Dissolution.
On March 23, 2009, the firm's partners voted for an orderly unwinding and dissolution of the firm, due in part to difficulties the firm was having in continuing its line of credit with Wachovia. In a press release, the firm announced:
WolfBlock will remain in the practice of law for several months to protect the interests of its clients, employees and creditors. The decision to unwind was reached in view of a confluence of unfavorable factors: the economic recession, especially in the firm's core real estate practice; the constriction of credit occasioned by the ongoing banking crisis; and the intended and anticipated departure of significant partners and practices.
Practice areas.
In addition to its lobbying practice, the firm had practice groups in corporate & securities law, health law, labor and employment, employee benefits, family law, real estate & land use, environmental law, structured finance, bankruptcy and creditors' rights, tax law, estate planning, energy law, intellectual property, and construction law.

Villa Gamberaia

Villa Gamberaia is a 14th-century villa near Settignano, outside Florence, Tuscany, Italy.
It is it characterized now by 18th-century terraced garden. The setting was praised by Edith Wharton, who saw it after years of tenant occupation with its parterre planted with roses and cabbages, and by Georgina Masson, who saw it restored by Sig. Marcello Marchi after its near ruin during the Second World War. to the immaculately clipped and tailored condition today.
History.
The villa, originally a farmhouse; was owned by Matteo Gamberelli, a stonemason, at the beginning of the fifteenth century. His sons Giovanni and Bernardo became famous architects under the name of Rossellino. After Bernardo's son sold it to Jacopo Riccialbani in 1597, the house was greatly enlarged, then almost completely rebuilt by the following owner, Zenobi Lapi; documents of his time mention a "limonaia" and the turfed bowling green that is part of the garden layout today.
In 1717 La Gamberaia passed to the Capponi family. Andrea Capponi laid out the long bowling green, planted cypresses, especially in a long allée leading to the monumental fountain enclosed within the "bosco" (wooded area), and peopled the garden with statues, as can be seen in an etching by Giuseppe Zocchi dedicated to marchese Scipione Capponi, which shows the cypress avenue half-grown and the bowling green flanked by mature trees that have since gone. The villa already stood on its raised platform, extended to one side, where the water parterre is today. The parterre was laid out with clipped "broderies" in the French manner in the eighteenth century, as a detailed estate map described by Georgina Masson demonstrates. Olive groves have always occupied the slopes below the garden, which has a distant view of the roofs and towers of Florence.
The monumental fountain set into a steep hillside at one lateral flank of this terraced garden has a seated god flanked by lions in stucco relief in a niche decorated with pebble mosaics and rusticated stonework. 
The preservation of the garden at Villa Gamberaia Edith Wharton astutely attributed to its "obscure fate" during the nineteenth century, when more prominent gardens with richer owners in more continuous attendance had their historic features improved clean away. Shortly after Wharton saw it, the villa was purchased in 1895 by Princess Jeanne Ghyka, sister of Queen Natalia of Serbia, who lived here with her American companion, Miss Blood, and thoroughly restored it;. It was she who substituted pools of water for the parterre beds.
During World War II, the villa was almost completely destroyed. Marcello Marchi restored it after the war, using old prints, maps and photographs for guidance.

Notes.
DIBANG
"Crisp and stern, that’s him. For a minute, you’d think he’s bland. No smiles, please. Wait a minute, there’s more to this front man of Aaj Tak. It’s his insatiable energy for news that makes him fearlessly aggressive on air. Professionally, he’s rated amongst the best Hindi anchors in the industry today. He’s made an impression on rural India, subtly. “It’s about making a connection with the viewers,” says 34-year-old Dibang. Of course, his surname remains a secret. “I’m more popular in Rai Bareilly than in Delhi.” Camera shy? “Never, I even acted in an Italian film by Italo Spinnelli.” Difficult moment? “When my colleagues Ranjan Jha and cameraman Gopal Singh Bisht died in a plane crash along with Congress leader Madhav Rao Scindia. I got really emotional on air.” His flirtation with TV began when SP Singh asked him to join Aaj Tak." from The Times of India
Acting.

Helen Skelton

Helen Elizabeth Skelton (born 19 July 1983 in Carlisle) is an English television presenter. She worked on the BBC children's programme "Blue Peter" from 2008 to 2013. In 2010 she kayaked over 2,000 miles along the River Amazon, and in 2012 she finished a 500-mile (800 km) trek to the South Pole, both for Sport Relief, making her a double Guinness world record holder.
Personal life.
Skelton was brought up on a dairy farm in the village of Kirkby Thore in Cumbria. She attended Kirkby Thore Primary School, and then Appleby Grammar School. She graduated from Cumbria Institute of the Arts, where she gained a BA degree in journalism. During her time at college, she worked as an extra on "Coronation Street" and "Cutting It."
Her brother, Gavin, is a professional footballer currently playing for Workington.
In August 2012, Helen announced she was closing her Twitter account because she "cannot cope with negative comments". 
Skelton is a qualified tap dance teacher and has said that if she was not a broadcaster she would be a teacher. In December 2012, she took part in a Christmas Special edition of the BBC One programme "Strictly Come Dancing".
In December 2013 she got married to England national rugby league team player Richie Myler.
Career.
Early career.
After briefly working in public relations, Helen decided to concentrate on journalism. She worked in the newsroom at CFM Radio, and was involved with various programmes at Border Television, before becoming a breakfast presenter on BBC Radio Cumbria in 2005, becoming one of the youngest breakfast show presenters on the BBC network. She was then a reporter and occasional presenter on children's news programme "Newsround" and its weekend sports based version, "Sportsround".
"Blue Peter".
Skelton was revealed as a new "Blue Peter" presenter on 28 August 2008, replacing Zöe Salmon, becoming the 33rd presenter for the programme. In a challenge for the show, she took an uncredited role in the BBC production of "Merlin". In August 2013 she announced her departure from the show in September, to be replaced by Radzi Chinyanganya.
Ultra marathons.
In April 2009, Skelton became only the second woman ever to finish the Namibian ultra marathon. Skelton completed the run in 23 hours and 45 minutes - just 15 minutes under the time limit of one day. "It was a gruelling experience, but one I'll never forget. There were tough times but also amazing times," she told Newsround. Just weeks later, she completed the 2009 London Marathon.
Kayaking the Amazon.
In early 2010, Skelton kayaked the entire length of the River Amazon for Sport Relief 2010. She kayaked on a solo journey from Nauta in Peru on 20 January, to Almeirim, Brazil on 28 February. It was initially claimed that she had achieved two Guinness World Records: the longest solo journey by kayak, and the longest distance in a kayak in 24 hours by a woman. but the latter of these was not verified and was superseded within months.
MP for the Ribble Valley Nigel Evans tabled an Early Day Motion in the House of Commons after her Amazon challenge:
Tightrope walking.
Skelton walked a 150-metre tightrope between chimneys at Battersea Power Station, 66 metres above ground, to raise money for Comic Relief on 28 February 2011. Blue Peter created two specials about her walk.
South Pole.
In 2012, Skelton raised more money for Sport Relief by becoming the first person to reach the South Pole using a bicycle. The bike was custom built for her trip, with 8-inch-wide tyres. She also used skis and a kite to help her pull a sled containing 82 kg of supplies.
She covered 329 miles by kite ski, 103 by bike and 69 by cross-country ski. She is also the first person to claim a world record for the fastest 100 km by kite ski, in seven hours 28 minutes, which was set during the trip (subject to verification). A degree of controversy surrounds the speed for distance claim but Guinness World Records defended the award saying "We are aware of explorers who have achieved longer distances, but Helen Skelton’s application was the first that Guinness World Records had received specifically for the 100-kilometre distance". "Blue Peter" also made 5-6 episode specials for this event.
Helen's Magnificent 7.
In April 2013, wanting to inspire the young Blue Peter viewers to do something to support Comic Relief, she took on seven challenges set by Comic Relief while breaking one world record. She called this series of challenges her "Magnificent 7":
After "Blue Peter".
Skelton has taken on other projects during her time on "Blue Peter", mainly correspondent-based. These included reporting from the Championships, Wimbledon, and regular positions on "Countryfile" and "Holiday Hit Squad". Post her departure from "Blue Peter", she will become a presenter of live FA Women's Super League football matches for the BT Sport channel, as well as retaining her other existing BBC reporter roles.
