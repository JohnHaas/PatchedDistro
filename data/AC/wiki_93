El Centro Imperials

The El Centro Imperials was an independent professional baseball team based out of El Centro, California. The team started play in 1947 in the Sunset League and was folded in 1952. Another team, the Imperial Valley Brahmas played in El Centro in 1995 as part of the Golden State League and the Imperials were revived on April 3, 2009 as one of the four charter members of the new Arizona Summer League, an instructional summer professional baseball league affiliated with the Golden Baseball League. That version of the team was managed by former Los Angeles Dodgers player Mike Marshall, but lasted just the one season.
Team history.
The Imperials began as a minor league baseball team with the Sunset League from 1947 to 1950 and then the Southwest International League in 1951 and 1952 (the team shortened their name to the "Imps" in 1952). They played their home games at Stark Field in El Centro.
They won the Sunset League championship in 1950 before moving to the Southwest League, but were the worst team in the Southwest League in 1952. They went 28-47-1 before withdrawing from the league on July 13. The club did not have past or future major-leaguers on their roster during the campaign.
On April 3, 2009, the Imperials were revived and were named one of four charter teams in the Golden Baseball League's newest instructional league, the Arizona Summer League. They played their home games at Stark Field in El Centro, while most other teams played theirs at Desert Sun Stadium in Yuma, Arizona.
Honored by the Scorpions.
In 2008, the Imperials were honored by the GBL's Yuma Scorpions by having four games played at Stark Field during the season as Scorpions home games. The team donned special throwback uniforms of the Imperials. The last game was an 11-7 loss to the Chico Outlaws on August 27.

301 Squadron (Portugal)

The 301 Squadron ""Jaguares"" ("Esquadra 301") is a fighter squadron of the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF).
Roles and missions.
The 301 Squadron has the mission of executing operations of air defense and conventional attack in all-weather conditions.
History.
Activated with the designation 301 Squadron in 1978, the origins of the ""Jaguares"" squadron dates back to the former Portuguese Air Force squadrons that operated the Fiat G-91 "Gina" between 1965 and 1993. During the Portuguese Colonial War these group of squadrons executed more than 13,000 operational missions, having been shot down five aircraft by anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and surface-to-air missile (SAM).
In August 1974, in the post-revolution period, the transfer of the Fiat G-91 aircraft from Air Base 5, in Monte Real, and of all air bases in the Portuguese African colonies to Air Base 6, in Montijo was initiated. The 62 Squadron was then created to operate the Fiat G-91.
With the reorganization of the Air Force's aerial units, in 1978, the squadron's designation was changed to 301 Squadron, thus assigning as its primary mission the execution of operations of close air support (CAS), air interdiction (IA) and tactical air reconnaissance, as well as its secondary mission the execution of actions of tactical air support for maritime operations (TASMO) and of air defense operations (DCA). 
On June 27, 1993, with the last flight of the Fiat G-91 in service with the Portuguese Air Force, and the subsequent retirement of this aircraft, as well the recent restructuring of the PoAF, the 301 Squadron was transferred to Air Base 11, in Beja, having been equipped with the ground-attack aircraft Alpha Jet A. This aircraft's first flight was conducted on October 6, 1993 by of Major Lopes da Silva.
During the joint exercise COMAO (Composite Air Operations), on September 5, 2005, the 301 Squadron reached the 20,000 flight hours with its Alpha Jet fleet. Shortly after, on November 20, 2005, the ""Jaguares"" conducted their last operation flight with the Alpha Jet.
On November 25, 2005, the 301 Squadron was transferred to Air Base 5, in Monte Real, and equipped with the modernized F-16 MLU, being the first flight squadron of the Portuguese Air Force to operate exclusive this version of the fighter.

Li Huaixian

Li Huaixian (李懷仙) (died July 8, 768) was a general of the Chinese rebel state Yan, who later submitted to and became a general of Tang Dynasty, from which Yan had rebelled. As was in the case of several other Yan generals who submitted to Tang but who had substantial army and territorial holdings, Li was allowed to retain his command and territory, semi-independent of the Tang imperial government structure, but unlike the others, he was unable to hold onto power for long and was assassinated in 768 by his subordinates Zhu Xicai, Zhu Ci, and Zhu Tao.
Background.
It is not known when Li Huaixian was born, but it is known that he was from Liucheng (柳城, in modern Chaoyang, Liaoning) and that he was of Xiongnu stock. His family had served the Khitan for generations, but he became a subject of Tang Dynasty and became a Tang military officer at Ying Prefecture (營州, i.e., Liucheng). He later served under the Tang general An Lushan.
During Anshi Rebellion.
An Lushan rebelled against the rule of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang in late 755, and Li Huaixian, serving under An, participated in An's campaign to capture Tang's central territories, on which An established a state of Yan as its emperor. In spring 756, Li participated in the campaign led by fellow Yan general Linghu Chao (令狐潮) against the city of Yongqiu, defended by the Tang general Zhang Xun, but the Yan generals were unable to capture Yongqiu and eventually forced to withdraw. He later successively served under the next three Yan emperors – An Lushan's son An Qingxu, An Lushan's major general Shi Siming, and Shi Siming's son Shi Chaoyi. After Shi Chaoyi had succeeded to the Yan throne after assassinating his father Shi Siming in 761, he made Li the mayor of the key city Fanyang. According to the Tang Dynasty historian Ping Zhimei (平致美), whose "Jimen Jiluan" (薊門紀亂) is no longer extant but is often cited in other works, when Li arrived at Fanyang, Fanyang was in a state of disturbance after various Yan generals in Fanyang had fought and killed each other in street battles in the confusion after Shi Siming's death, and it was Li who put down the disturbance and restored order.
After a joint Tang and Huige army decisively defeated Shi Chaoyi and recaptured Shi Chaoyi's capital Luoyang, Shi Chaoyi fled north toward Fanyang. Before Shi Chaoyi reached Fanyang, however, Li sent messengers to the powerful Tang eunuch Luo Fengxian (駱奉仙) and offered to submit to Tang. He sent his subordinate Li Baozhong (李抱忠) to Fanyang County (a city near, but not the same, as Fanyang) to block off Shi Chaoyi's path, and Shi Chaoyi, after being unable to capture Fanyang County, fled further north. Li Huaixian sent an army to pursue him, and Shi Chaoyi, believing the situation to be hopeless, committed suicide. Li Huaixian cut off Shi Chaoyi's head and presented it to Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, ending the Anshi Rebellion.
After Anshi Rebellion.
After Li Huaixian's submission, the Tang imperial government was hesitant to move them, fearing another rebellion, and at the suggestion of the general Pugu Huai'en, Li Huaixian, along with fellow Yan generals Xue Song, Li Baochen, and Tian Chengsi, were allowed to keep their territory, and he was made the military governor ("jiedushi") of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), consisting of six prefectures that he controlled. The four former Yan generals formed alliances among themselves, as well as with two other military governors, Li Zhengji and Liang Chongyi, hoping to be able to pass their territories to their descendants, semi-independent of the Tang imperial government, retaining their armies and taxes without submitting them to the imperial government. However, in summer 768, Li Huaixian's subordinates Zhu Xicai, Zhu Ci, and Zhu Ci's brother Zhu Tao, jointly rose against Li Huaixian and killed him. Zhu Xicai took over command of the circuit. Li Baochen, who was friendly with Li Huaixian and who lamented Li Huaixian's death, sent an army to attack Zhu Xicai, but was defeated by Zhu Xicai. The Tang imperial government was subsequently forced to recognize Zhu Xicai as the new military governor.

Jewish art music

Jewish art music is music written using Western classical techniques, but with melodic, rhythmic and textual content taken from traditional Jewish folk or liturgical music. The Jewish art music movement began at the end of the 19th century in Russia, with a group of Russian Jewish classical composers dedicated to preserving Jewish folk music and creating a new, characteristically Jewish genre of classical music. The group founded the St. Petersburg Society for Jewish Folk Music, a movement that spread to Moscow, Poland, Austria, and later Palestine and the United States. Although the original society existed formally for only 10 years (from 1908 to 1918), its impact on the course of Jewish music was profound. The society, and the art music movement it fostered, inspired a new interest in the music of Eastern European Jewry throughout Europe and America. It laid the foundations for the Jewish music and Klezmer revival in the United States, and was a key influence in the development of Israeli folk and classical music.
Jewish art music is a unique blending of traditional Jewish melodic constructs with the rich chromatic harmonies of late Russian romantic music.
With the outbreak of World War I and the rise of Communism in Russia, most of the composers active in the Jewish art music movement fled Eastern Europe, finding their ways to Palestine or America. There, they became leaders of the Jewish musical communities, composing for both synagogue and the concert hall.
Origins.
The interest in Jewish national music coincided with the nationalist trends in music throughout Eastern Europe. In Russia, composers led by Rimsky-Korsakov, were composing new works based on Russian folk themes. In Hungary, Zoltán Kodály and later Béla Bartók undertook a massive project of recording and cataloging folk melodies, and incorporating them into their compositions. Other composers such as Antonín Dvořák and Leoš Janáček were increasingly seeking a uniquely national sound in their work. "Europe was impelled by the Romantic tendency to establish in musical matters the national boundaries more and more sharply," wrote Alfred Einstein. "The collecting and sifting of old traditional melodic treasures ... formed the basis for a creative art-music."
Parallel with this trend toward national music styles was an awakening of nationalist sentiment among the Jews of Russia and Eastern Europe. Long subjected to severe restrictions on their lives, outbursts of violent antisemitic pogroms, and forced concentration in a segregated region of Russia called the Pale of Settlement, Russian jewry developed an intense nationalist identity during the 1880s onward. This identity gave rise to a number of political movements - the Zionist movement, which advocated emigration from Russia to Palestine, and the Bund, which sought cultural equality and autonomy within Russia. There was a flowering of Yiddish literature, with authors like Sholem Aleichem, Mendele Mocher Sforim and others. A Yiddish theater movement started, and numerous Yiddish newspapers and periodicals were published.
In spite of the restrictions on residency and quotas on Jewish students in universities, many Russian Jews enrolled as music students at the St. Petersburg and Moscow Conservatories. These included violinist Joseph Achron, composer Mikhail Gnesin, and others. Many of the great violinists of the last century — Jascha Heifetz, Nathan Milstein, Efrem Zimbalist, Mischa Elman, to name a few — were Jewish students of Leopold Auer, who taught at the conservatory. 
While many of these students came from orthodox Jewish backgrounds — Achron, for example, was son of a cantor — their studies of music at the conservatory were strictly of the western classical tradition. However, the rise of nationalism in Russian music also awakened an incipient interest in Jewish music. In 1895, Yiddish writer Y.L. Peretz started collecting lyrics of Yiddish folksongs. Abraham Goldfaden, founder of the Yiddish theater in Russia, incorporated many folksongs and folk style music in his productions. In 1898, two Jewish historians, Saul Ginsburg and Pesach Marek, embarked on the first effort to create an anthology of Jewish folk music.
The main catalyzer of the movement for national Jewish music, however, was Joel Engel. Engel, composer and music critic, was born outside the Pale of Jewish settlement, and was a completely assimilated Russian. A meeting with the Russian nationalist critic Vladimir Stasov inspired Engel to seek his Jewish roots. "(Stasov's) words struck Engel's imagination like lightning, and the Jew awoke in him," (ref.Weinberg(1946) wrote friend and fellow composer Jacob Weinberg, an extraordinarily prolific Russian-Jewish composer and concert pianist (1879-1956) who joined the Moscow branch of the Society of Jewish Folk Music and went on to write the first Hebrew opera, "The Pioneers" (Hechalutz) in 1924. Engel set out to study the folk music of the Jews of the Russian shtetls, spending the summer of 1897 traveling throughout the Pale, listening to and notating Yiddish songs. In 1900, he issued an album of ten Jewish songs, and presented a lecture concert of Jewish folk music.
The St. Petersburg Society for Jewish Folk Music.
In 1908, Engel and a group of like-minded musicians from the Petersburg conservatory, (including Lazare Saminsky), founded the "St. Petersburg Society for Jewish Folk Music." The objectives of the society were to develop Jewish music "by collecting folksongs ... and supporting Jewish composers," and to publish compositions and research on Jewish music.
The society produced concerts, primarily of arrangements of folk melodies for various ensembles, and published arrangements and original compositions by its members. These included the composers Solomon Rosowsky, Alexander Krein, Michael Gniessen, and the violinist Joseph Achron. 
With the growing nationalist and Zionist sentiment among the Jewish population, these concerts were received enthusiastically. In a concert in the Ukrainian city of Vinitse, for example, "the artists were met at the train and paraded through the Jewish part of the city with great ceremony and enthusiasm," recollected the local cantor. Among the artists performing in these concerts were violinists Jascha Heifetz and Efrem Zimbalist, cellist Joseph Press and the bass Feodor Chaliapin.
In 1912, the society sponsored an expedition that included the Yiddish musician and educator Sussman Kisselgoff, to record Jewish folk music using the newly invented Edison phonograph. The group recorded more than 1000 wax cylinders. The collection is preserved in the Vernadsky Library of Ukraine, in Kiev.
This collection is one of the most important ethnographic resources of Jewish life in Ukraine from that period. Another important endeavor of the society was the publication of a "Song Collection for Jewish Schools and Home." This songbook was a monumental six volumes, and includes, in addition to folksongs collected by Kisselgoff and others, original art songs and a section on cantillation of religious texts.
Jewish art music outside Russia.
The success of the society spread throughout Russia, and into eastern and central Europe. In 1913, a branch was founded in Khartov, and later in Moscow and Odessa. The advent of World War I and the Russian Revolution put an end to the formal existence of the society, but its members continued their activities and influence in Russia and abroad. Polish Jewish musicians such as Janot Rotkin, inspired by the society, embarked on their own projects of gathering, arranging, and composing Jewish music. In 1928, the Society for the Promotion of Jewish Music was founded in Vienna.

With the onset of the Russian revolution, most of the leading members of the St. Petersburg society left Russia. Joel Engel moved to Berlin in 1922, where he established the Juwal Publishing house. There he republished many of the society's works. Two years later he moved on to Palestine, and started Jibneh, which continued the publishing work of Juwal. He died in Palestine in 1927. Lazare Saminsky emigrated to the U.S. in 1920, where he became a leading figure in the promotion of Jewish music. He was music director of the Temple Emanu-El reform congregation in New York, and one of the founders of Mailamm, an institute for the study of Jewish music that grew into the American Society for Jewish Music. Solomon Rosowsky moved to Palestine, and later to the United States, where he continued composing, teaching and researching Jewish music.

Karl I, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst

Karl I of Anhalt-Zerbst (Dessau, 17 November 1534 – Zerbst, 4 May 1561), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst.
He was the eldest son of John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his wife Margaret, daughter of Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg.
Life.
After the death of his father in 1551, Karl inherited Anhalt-Zerbst jointly with his younger brothers Joachim Ernest and Bernhard VII according to the family law of the House of Ascania, without any division of the territories of the principality.
In 1553 Karl and his brothers inherited Anhalt-Plötzkau after the death of their uncle George III.
In Zerbst on 16 May 1557 Karl married Anna (5 February 1531 – 13 October 1592), daughter of Barnim XI, Duke of Pomerania. The union was childless.
Karl died seven months before his last surviving uncle, Joachim I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. It was his brothers and their successors who inherited the territories of Joachim's principality.

1 22 polytope

In 6-dimensional geometry, the 122 polytope is a uniform polytope, constructed from the E6 group. It was first published in E. L. Elte's 1912 listing of semiregular polytopes, named as V72 (for its 72 vertices).
Coxeter named it 122 for its bifurcating Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, with a single ring on the end of the 1-node sequence. There are two rectifications of the 122, construcated by positions points on the elements of 122. The rectified 122 is constructed by points at the mid-edges of the 122. The birectified 122 is constructed by points at the triangle face centers of the 122.
These polytopes are from a family of 39 convex uniform polytopes in 6-dimensions, made of uniform polytope facets and vertex figures, defined by all permutations of rings in this Coxeter-Dynkin diagram: .
1_22 polytope.
The 1_22 polytope contains 72 vertices, and 54 5-demicubic facets. It has a birectified 5-simplex vertex figure. Its 72 vertices represent the root vectors of the simple Lie group E6.
Construction.
It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 6 hyperplane mirrors in 6-dimensional space.
The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, .
Removing the node on either of 2-length branches leaves the 5-demicube, 131, .
The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the birectified 5-simplex, 022, .
Related polytopes and honeycomb.
Along with the semiregular polytope, 221, it is also one of a family of 39 convex uniform polytopes in 6-dimensions, made of uniform polytope facets and vertex figures, defined by all permutations of rings in this Coxeter-Dynkin diagram: .
Geometric folding.
The 122 is related to the 24-cell by a geometric folding E6 → F4 of Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams, E6 corresponding to 122 in 6 dimensions, F4 to the 24-cell in 4 dimensions. This can be seen in the Coxeter plane projections. The 24 vertices of the 24-cell are projected in the same two rings as seen in the 122.
Tessellations.
This polytope is the vertex figure for a uniform tessellation of 6-dimensional space, 222, .
Rectified 1_22 polytope.
The rectified 122 polytope (also called 0221) can tessellate 6-dimensional space as the Voronoi cell of the E6* honeycomb lattice (dual of E6 lattice).
Construction.
Its construction is based on the E6 group and information can be extracted from the ringed Coxeter-Dynkin diagram representing this polytope: .
Removing the ring on the short branch leaves the birectified 5-simplex, .
Removing the ring on the either 2-length branch leaves the birectified 5-orthoplex in its alternated form: t2(211), .
The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring ring. This makes 3-3 duoprism prism, {3}×{3}×{}, .

Jacques Specx

Jacques Specx (; 1585 – 22 July 1652) was a Dutch merchant, who founded the trade on Japan and Korea in 1609. Jacques Specx received the support of William Adams to obtain extensive trading rights from the Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu on August 24, 1609, which allowed him to establish a trading factory in Hirado on September 20, 1609. He was the interim governor in Batavia between 1629 - 1632. There his daughter Saartje Specx was involved in a scandal. Back home in Holland Specx became an art-collector.
The Dutch, who, rather than "Nanban" were called "Kōmō" (Jp:紅毛, lit. "Red Hair") by the Japanese, first arrived in Japan in 1600, on board the "Liefde".
In 1605, two of the "Liefde"'s crew were sent to Pattani by Tokugawa Ieyasu, to invite Dutch trade to Japan. The head of the Pattani Dutch trading post, Victor Sprinckel, refused on the ground that he was too busy dealing with Portuguese opposition in Southeast Asia.
1609 mission to Japan.
Jacques Specx sailed on a fleet of eleven ships that left Texel in 1607 under the command of Pieter Willemsz Verhoeff. After arriving in Bantam two ships which were dispatched to establish the first official trade relations between the Netherlands and Japan.
The two ships Specx commanded were "De Griffioen" (the "Griffin", 19 cannons) and "Roode Leeuw met Pijlen" (the "Red lion with arrows", 400 tons, 26 cannons). The ships arrived in Japan on July 2, 1609.
Among the crews were the Chief merchants Abraham van den Broeck and Nicolaas Puyck and the under-merchant Jaques Specx.
The exact composition of the delegation is uncertain; but it has been established that van den Broeck and Puyck traveled to the Shogunal Court, and Melchior van Santvoort acted as the mission's interpreter. Santevoort had arrived a few years earlier aboard the Dutch ship "De Liefde." He had established himself as a merchant in Nagasaki.
The Shogun granted the Dutch the access to all ports in Japan, and confirmed this in an act of safe-conduct, stamped with his red seal. (Inv.nr.1a.).
In September 1609 the ship's Council decided to hire a house on Hirado island (west of the southern main island Kiushu). Jacques Specx became the first "Opperhoofd" (Chief) of the new Company's factory.
In 1610, Specx sent a ship to Korea.

Clio trestle

The Clio Trestle is a railroad trestle on the historic Feather River Route of the Union Pacific Railroad. It is located in the Sierra Nevada near Clio in Plumas County, California. The trestle is high and long.
History - Feather River Route.
The Western Pacific Railroad (now part of the Union Pacific) built the Feather River Route across the Sierra Nevada in 1909 to complete a San Francisco Bay Area - Salt Lake City, Utah route, competing with the Southern Pacific Railroad's route over Donner Pass. While significantly longer, the Feather River route was chosen by the Western Pacific because its high point, the Chilcoot Tunnel under Beckwourth Pass, is at an elevation of only , as opposed to over Donner Pass, and also because most of the route follows a gentle grade along the Feather River.
Railfanning.
The Clio Trestle is a favorite railfan spot and is part of the Plumas County and Western Pacific Railroad Museum's "7 Wonders of the Western Pacific Railroad World" exhibit and tour. History and railfan access are described in two travel guides.
The trestle can be reached via Clio State Road 40A, either north 1.5 miles from State Highway 89 at Clio, or south 3.7 miles from State Highway 70.

Dick Davis

Richard Earl Davis (born September 25, 1963, at Long Beach, California) is an American former professional baseball player. He played all or part of six seasons in Major League Baseball from 1977 until 1982, primarily as an outfielder. He also played five seasons in Japan with the Kintetsu Buffaloes from 1984 until 1988.
Playing career.
Brewers.
Davis was signed as an amateur free agent by the Milwaukee Brewers in 1972. After several years in the minors, he was called up to the Brewers in July 1977. He split time in the outfield and as a designated hitter for the next four seasons, being used at DH more often than any other Brewer between 1978 and 1980.
Phillies.
During spring training in 1981, the Brewers traded Davis to the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Randy Lerch. Davis played some right field and also came off the bench as a pinch hitter 20 times. Though Davis missed most of July and August with an injury, he did hit .333 with 19 RBI in just 96 at bats. Davis continued in the same role to start the 1982 season, but would soon be on the move again.
Wayne Nordhagen and MLB career end.
In June 1982, Davis would be traded not once, but twice, each time for the same player. At the June 15 trading deadline, the Phillies first traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays for outfielder Wayne Nordhagen. While the Phillies sent Nordhagen on to the Pittsburgh Pirates on the same day in exchange for another outfielder, Bill Robinson, Davis stayed in Toronto for an entire week, appearing in 3 games and going 2-for-7 at the plate. On June 22, the Blue Jays traded Davis to the Pirates for a player to be named later. On June 25, the Pirates sent a player to the Blue Jays—and it was Wayne Nordhagen.
Davis struggled for the rest of the season in Pittsburgh, batting just .182 in 77 at bats. Not a very good defensive outfielder, Davis needed to hit well to keep his job, and Pittsburgh wound up releasing Davis in March of .
Japanese career.
Davis found a second career with the Kintetsu Buffaloes of the Japanese Pacific League, who signed him for the 1984 season. While Davis hit a solid .310 with 18 home runs in 1984, he really broke out in 1985, hitting 40 home runs, driving in 109 runs, and batting .343 in 128 games. During the season, he hit home runs in six straight games to tie a league record. He repeated his success in , batting .337. In 1987, he drove in nine runs in one game on April 28.
Davis also had his share of troubles in Japan. In 1986, he charged the mound after being hit by a pitch by Osamu Higashio and was fined 100,000 yen. Then, in 1988, his apartment was raided by the Japanese police, who found 14 grams of marijuana and related paraphernalia. After three weeks in police custody, he was released by the Buffaloes and sent home to the United States.

Eleonora Cockatoo

The Eleonora Cockatoo, "Cacatua galerita eleonora", also known as Medium Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, is similar in appearance to other subspecies of the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo. It is found in the Aru and Kai Islands of Indonesia, where it was introduced and is common in aviculture.
It is the smallest of the four subspecies of "Cacatua galerita", at approx. 44 cm long and weighing in at between 404–602 grammes. Apart from the size difference, the Eleonora differs from the Greater Sulphur Crested in that it doesn't have as prominent white eyerings (they often are a pale blue), the crest of an Eleonora is often less curved and it doesn't have the certain pointy upper mandible, which is only found in "Cacatua galerita galerita".
The Eleonora Cockatoo often has pale yellow ear patches, and yellow diffusion throughout the body, especially under the wings and tail. The Eleonora also has a bald patch behind its crest.
The Eleonora Cockatoo was named by Dr. Otto Finsch. He discovered the subspecies in Amsterdam's Artis zoo and named it after Maria Eleonora van der Schroef, the wife of the then director of the zoo.
Diet and habitat.
In the wild, the Eleonora Cockatoo is found in open woodlands, forests, and semi-arid forested areas, as well as partially cleared forest areas. It feeds on nuts, berries, flower buds, flowers, seeds and insects.
Reproduction.
The breeding season of this cockatoo is mainly from September to January. The birds build their nests in a tree hollow or rock crevice. The female lays 2-3 white oval eggs, which hatch after a period of 30 days. Both parents incubate the eggs and in turn provide for the chicks. The young fledge after about 75 days.
Intelligence and beat perception.
One notable Eleonora Cockatoo is Snowball, a bird recently demonstrated to be capable of beat induction - in other words, that the bird is capable of perceiving a musical beat and dancing to it.
Like all cockatoos, the Eleonora Cockatoo is widely considered to be very intelligent and emotionally complex.

Northern Breed Group

Northern Breed Group is the name of a breed Group of dogs, used by kennel clubs to classify a defined collection of dog breeds. Dogs listed in the "Northern Breed Group" may not all be of the same type of dog.
Northern dogs.
Spitz-type dogs are the primary dog type of the Arctic and northern parts of the world, and the Shiba Inu, Chow Chow, Alaskan Malamute, Siberian Husky and Samoyed are being shown by genetic research to be descendents of the oldest dog types known. The Spitz or Northern-type dogs of today developed from antiquity along with humans, and in modern times have been selectively bred and documented as a wide variety of purebred modern breeds, including those listed here.
Major registries.
The "Northern Breed Group" is the Group category used by the United Kennel Club (US).
Minor registries.
Many of the regional breeds recognised by the United Kennel Club are very few in number in the United States. As a US-based club they have specialized in the registry of North American breeds, especially hunting and working/utility dogs. Since many of these breeds are few in number (so called rare breeds), they also may be listed with a variety of small breed clubs, dog sport clubs, minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog businesses.
In this Group, the Alaskan Klee Kai (a new breed developed from a mixed breed dog in the 1970s in Alaska, USA) can be still be registered with the American Rare Breed Association as well as with the United Kennel Club.
Not recognised.
A breed that is not recognised by a kennel club means that it has not been sufficiently vetted according to that particular kennel club's rules.

Scenthound Group

Scenthound Group is the name of a breed Group of dogs, used by kennel clubs to classify a defined collection of dog breeds. Dogs listed in a kennel club's "Scenthound Group" may not all be of the same type of dog.
Scenthound type.
Hounds are hunting dogs that either hunt by following the scent of a game animal ("scenthounds") or by following the animal by sight (sighthounds). There are many breeds in the "scenthound type", and scenthounds may do other work as well, so exactly which breeds should be called "scenthound" can be controversial. Kennel clubs assign breeds of dogs to "Groups", which are loosely based on breed "types". Each kennel club determines which breeds it will place in a given group.
United Kennel Club Scenthound Group.
The "Scenthound Group" is the Group category used by the United Kennel Club (US), which it divides into two categories. The first includes the American hunting dogs known as coonhounds and the European hounds from which they were developed. These are referred to as Tree Hounds. The category also includes curs, American dogs bred for hunting bears, feral pigs, and similar large game. The second category is referred to as trailing scenthounds, and includes dogs used for tracking of humans, reputedly descended from the St. Hubert Hounds (ancestor of today's Bloodhound breed) kept by monks in Belgium.
Other registries.
This article only covers the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, but there are national clubs in many countries where many of these breeds may also be listed in similar or other Breed Groups.
Many of the regional breeds recognised by the United Kennel Club are very few in number in the United States. As a US-based club they have specialised in the registry of North American breeds, especially hunting and working/utility dogs. The United Kennel Club also lists internationally recognised (Fédération Cynologique Internationale) breeds that are few in number outside their native areas. Many of these are called rare breeds in the United States, and breeders and dog owners may register their dogs with any of the very large number of small breed clubs, dog sport clubs, minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog businesses, in order to participate in the club's or business' activities. For breeds not yet recognised by one of the major kennel clubs, there are usually numerous competing breed clubs for each individual breed.
Not recognised.
A breed that is not recognised by a kennel club means that it has not been sufficiently vetted according to that particular kennel club's rules. It does not mean that the breed is not a breed. A kennel club usually requires a breed to have a large enough breed club to warrant the training of judges for the breed, as well as a specific amount of documentation, to accept a breed.

Paula Meehan

Paula Meehan is an Irish poet and playwright. Born in Dublin in 1955, Meehan studied at Trinity College, Dublin,and at Eastern Washington University.
Biography.
Paula Meehan was born in Dublin in 1955, the eldest of six children. She started school at St. Elizabeth's in Kingston upon Thames, England, where her parents had travelled to find work. She subsequently attended a number of primary schools around Dublin. She finished her primary education at the Central Model Girls' School in Gardiner Street.
She began her secondary education at St. Michael's Holy Faith Covent in Finglas but was expelled for organising a protest march against the regime of the school. She studied for her Intermediate Certificate on her own and then went to Whitehall House Senior School, a vocational school, to study for her Leaving Certificate. Outside school she was a member of a dance drama group, became involved in band culture and, around 1970, began to write lyrics. Gradually composing song lyrics would give way to writing poetry.
At Trinity College, Dublin, (1972–77) she studied English, History and Classical Civilization, taking five years to complete her Bachelor of Arts degree. This included one year off, spent travelling through Europe. While a student she was involved in street theatre and various kinds of performance.
After college she travelled again, spending long stretches in Greece, Germany, Scotland and England. She was offered a teaching fellowship at Eastern Washington University where she studied (1981–83) with James J. McAuley in a two-year programme which led to a Master of Fine Arts degree in Poetry. Gary Snyder & Carolyn Kizer were among the distinguished visiting writers to have a profound influence on her work and on her thought.
She returned to Dublin in the mid-eighties. Her poem "Seed" was used in the 2010 Leaving Certificate examination as the unseen poem, although (critically) the department misprinted 'useful' as 'useless' which somewhat diminished the meaning of the poem. In September 2013, Meehan was awarded the Chair of Irish Poetry, Professor of Poetry, by President Michael D. Higgins. http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/paula-meehan-named-ireland-professor-of-poetry-1.1526752
Works.
Other.
Paula Meehan has also written poetry for film, for contemporary dance companies and for collaborations with visual artists; her poems have been put to music by songwriters (including Christy Moore) and composers. Her poetry has been extensively published in translation, including substantial collections in French and German.

<doc id="19071150" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19071150" title="CJOT-FM">
CJOT-FM

CJOT-FM ("boom 99.7") is a radio station based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada that broadcasts a classic hits programming format at 99.7 FM. The station broadcasts from its studios on Merivale Road in Nepean (shared with sister station CKQB-FM), and its transmitter located in Greely, in the south end of Ottawa.
History.
The station was authorized to its then-owner, Astral Media, by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on August 26, 2008 and launched on May 27, 2010 with an adult contemporary format branded as "99.7 EZ Rock". 
Upon the launch of CJOT, it became the new flagship station of the EZ Rock brand in Canada, about five months after the sign-off of Toronto's CJEZ-FM (now adult hits-formatted CHBM-FM, "boom 97.3"). However, on June 30, 2011, the station flipped to a classic hits format, branded as "boom 99.7". The last song on "EZ Rock" was "Forget You" by Cee-Lo Green, while "boom's" first song was "Start Me Up" by Rolling Stones. The station's playlist focuses on songs from 1964-1999.
In March 2013, as part of Bell Canada's proposed acquisition of Astral Media, Corus reached a tentative deal to acquire Astral's 50% stake in the Teletoon networks, along with several radio stations (including CJOT), for $400.6 million.
On January 28, 2014, the CRTC approved Corus's acquisition of CJOT-FM and sister station, CKQB-FM. The acquisition was closed on January 31, 2014.
Nearby station.
An unprotected low-power tourist information radio station owned by Instant Information Services operated at 99.7 FM as CIIO; that station was authorised by the CRTC in May 2010 to move to 97.5 MHz. As well, CKQB-FM operated a repeater at 99.7 FM in Pembroke, which later moved to 99.9 FM. It's uncertain if there will be any interference between these two stations.
Controversy.
On November 21, 2008, federal Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages James Moore issued a statement calling on the CRTC to review its approval of both the Astral station and Frank Torres' new CIDG-FM. Moore asked the commission to assess whether the francophone population of the Ottawa-Gatineau area was sufficiently well-served by existing French radio services, and to consider licensing one or more of the French language applications—which included a Christian music station, a community radio station and a campus radio station for the Université du Québec en Outaouais—in addition to or instead of the approved stations.
In the resulting round of hearings, Torres proposed that a new francophone station could be licensed on 94.5 FM, although such a station would be second-adjacent to Astral's CIMF-FM. Industry Canada subsequently aired a testing signal on 94.5 in May 2009 to determine whether the signal could be used without impacting CIMF. The test found that the signal could be used without causing significant interference to CIMF, and Astral consequently gave its consent to the use of the frequency as long as the company retained authorization to launch the 99.7 station.

Sighthound &amp; Pariah Group

Sighthound & Pariah Group is the name of a breed Group of dogs, used by the United Kennel Club to classify a defined collection of dog breeds. "Sighthound & Pariah Group" dogs are not all of the same dog type and may even be of different subspecies (the New Guinea Singing Dog is listed as "Canis lupus dingo".) The Fédération Cynologique Internationale refers to Pariah dog types as "Primitive types" and places them in Group 5 with Spitz types; sighthounds have their own group, Group 10. Other kennel clubs place most hounds together in the Hound Group, and the primitive types in other groups.
Sighthound and Pariah dog types.
Two different "types" of dogs are listed in this article.
Sighthounds.
Hounds are hunting dogs that hunt by endurance, following the scent of a game animal (scent hounds); or by speed, following the animal by sight (sighthounds). There are a few breeds of the "sighthound type", and many breeds of the "scent hound" type.
Pariah or Primitive dogs.
Pariah dogs refers to a broad class of specific "types" of feral dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and dogs that may be of another subspecies, Canis lupus dingo. Some zoologists believe that some of these dogs are of separate species. Genetic study may reveal the answer in the future. Any of these animals, if a breed club develops and if the dogs are sufficiently documented according to kennel club rules, might apply for listing as a breed of dog.
Sighthound & Pariah Group.
Kennel clubs assign breeds of dogs to "Groups", which are loosely based on breed "types". Breed Groups of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale more finely divide breeds by type and origin, and include separate "groups" for different types of hounds, while other kennel clubs have one "group" for all hounds. The "Sighthound & Pariah Group" is a Group category used by the United Kennel Club (US), placing together sighthounds and pariah or "primitive type" dogs, since both types have similar ancient lineage.
Other registries.
This article only covers the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, but there are national clubs in many countries where many of these breeds may also be listed in similar or other Breed Groups.
Other breeds may be may not be acceptable by major kennel clubs for a variety of reasons, usually that they are too small in number in a particular area, though they may be numerous in their place of origin. These are sometimes called rare breeds, and breeders and dog owners may register their dogs with any of the very large number of small breed clubs, dog sport clubs, minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog businesses in order to participate in the club's or business' activities. For breeds not yet recognised by one of the major kennel clubs, there are usually numerous competing breed clubs for each individual breed.
Not recognised.

Michael Mathieu

Michael Mathieu (born 24 June 1984) is a Bahamian sprinter from Freeport, Grand Bahama who specializes in 200 metres and 400 metres. He was part of the Bahamian silver medal-winning team in the men's 4×400 metres relay at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, running second leg and recording a 44.0 split. He was also a part of second place relay team at the 2007 World Championships.
Individually, he has won medals at the Central American and Caribbean Championships, taking the 400 m silver medal in 2008 and the 200 m gold in 2011. His personal bests are 20.16 seconds for the 200 m and 45.06 for the 400 m (the former being the Bahamian record mark).
Career.
Mathieu attended St George's High School in the Bahamas, graduating in 2001 as their "Most Outstanding Athlete". He gained a sports scholarship to attend Southwestern Christian College in Texas, United States. As a junior athlete, he won two relay medals in the under-20 section of the 2002 CAC Junior Championships. The following year he took the 400 m bronze medal at the 2003 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships. Moving up the age categories, he won a 400 m relay bronze medal at the 2006 NACAC Under-23 Championships in Athletics.
In 2004 he began studying economics at Texas Tech University and started competing for the Texas Tech Red Raiders under coach Wes Kittley. In the 2005 indoor track and field season he was runner-up at the Big 12 Conference meet in the 400 m and 4×400 m relay. He earned All-American honours by reaching the NCAA indoor relay final, then achieved the same feat in the outdoor season. The 2006 indoor season was his last at Texas Tech: he set a 200 m personal best of 21.34 seconds and again reached the NCAA relay final.
He reached the senior international level at the 2007 World Championships and became a fixture in the Bahamian national team from then onwards. He ran in the heats, both individually and in the relay, at the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships, then won two silver medals in the events at the 2008 Central American and Caribbean Championships. At the 2008 Summer Olympics he reached the semi-finals of the 400 m and took the relay silver medal with a time of 2:58.03 minutes.
At the 2009 CAC Championships he came sixth in the 400 m final. He was selected for the national team at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, but disqualifications meant he was out of the first round of both events. He performed better at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships, reaching the semi-finals, but the team failed to finish the relay. Outdoors, he was a silver medalist in the relay at the 2010 CAC Games and fourth in the relay at the 2010 Commonwealth Games.
In 2011, a switch to focus on the 200 m event saw him have a career breakthrough. He ran a personal best of 20.38 seconds to win at the national championships then claimed the gold medal in the event at the 2011 Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics. He also won the relay, running with Avard Moncur and Ramon Miller. He represented Bahamas in the 200 m at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, but failed to finish in his semi-final due to injury. He came close to medal at the 2011 Pan American Games, where he was fourth behind Brazil's Bruno de Barros.
He opened his 2012 season in strong form. Competing on the Brazilian Athletics Tour, he ran a Bahamian record of 20.16 seconds for the 200 m and set a personal best in the 400 m with a run 45.06 seconds. He also equalled his 100 metres best with a time of 10.30 seconds. He also won Gold at the 2012 London Olympics with the Bahamas 4x400 team beating medal favorites USA with a national record.

In 2011, fuelled by her passion to continue working on turtle conservation, she co-founded the Turtle Conservation Society of Malaysia. Currently, she is serving as its Vice-President. 
After retirement, Chan also started dabbling in art as a medium to help create awareness on turtles. She turned a derelict alley in Chinatown, Kuala Terengganu into a Turtle Alley to celebrate turtles and to bring more awareness to their plight. The alley is adorned with turtle mosaics mounted on the walls as well as along the walkway. Turtle trivia, fact sheets and her book, Little Turtle Messenger etched in metallic plates further enhance the educational value of the alley.
Chan is well known, both locally and abroad for her contributions in the field of turtle research, conservation and education. The recognition of her expertise is reflected in the various appointments at the national, regional and international levels accorded to her. She has also served as turtle expert in numerous regional and international sea turtle workshops, besides having been invited as guest/plenary/keynote speaker at numerous conferences and seminars.
Achievements and Recognition.
Chan is recognised for initiating the first Malaysian in-situ egg protection program for marine turtles in the Chagar Hutang Turtle Sanctuary in Redang Island. Since its inception in 1993, the project has developed into a long-term nesting and tagging research program that incorporates a highly successful volunteer program. 
In 2004, she extended her work to cover the critically endangered river terrapins of Terengganu. This work is now carried out as community-based projects in the Setiu and Kemaman Rivers under the "Turtle Conservation Society" of Malaysia.

Stavangerflint

Stavangerflint AS was an earthenware factory in Stavanger, Norway, that was in operation from 1949 until 1979.
Company history.
Stavangerflint AS started production of pottery tableware (earthenware) for households and for the professional market in Stavanger, Norway in 1949 under the name of "Stavanger Fajansefabrikk A/s." 
The initiators, Trygve Brekke (1908–1994) and Trygve Pedersen (1887-1969) took as their starting point the market conditions and needs resulting from inter-war imports of ceramic tableware, the war and post-war shortage of goods, and expectations for a growing domestic demand as the country gradually recovered, and as people's purchasing power grew.
Stavanger Fajansefabrikk aimed from the start for a clay mixture and manufacturing process which was to be marketed as "Stavangerflint", based on a recipe developed by Josiah Wedgwood in England around 1750. This was a marketable name which had the aim of presenting the factory's products as strong and durable earthenware.
On 16 April 1952 Stavanger Fajansefabrikk A.s. changed its name to "Stavangerflint AS". By adding the word "flint" to the company name, the quality angle of the products would be enhanced.
In 1968 Stavangerflint AS merged with its competitor Figgjo Fajanse AS. Stavangerflint continued as a branch of Figgjo Fajanse - Stavangerflint AS.
Thirty years after Stavangerflint had started production and quickly developed into a showcase manufacturing plant, it was closed down. In 1979 the properties in Stavanger were sold. All production was transferred to Figgjo and the business changed its name from Figgjo Fajanse – Stavangerflint A/S to Figgjo AS.
Management and Artistic Directors.
During its 19 years as an independent company, Stavangerflint had three artistic directors: Thorbjørn Feyling (1949-1955), Eystein Sandnes (1955-1957) and Kåre Berven Fjeldsaa (1958-1968). In 1963 Sigurd Jensen (1919-2000) succeeded Trygve Brekke as managing director. Sigurd Jensen had been Commercial Director and second in command at Stavangerflint from the start. Jensen was to play an important role as the driving force in the processes which led to the amalgamation of Stavangerflint AS and Figgjo Fajanse AS. The new company continued production at the old premises as two branches and the goods had their old markings which were identical to the original factory names.
Artists.
An important source for information about what was produced in the potteries in Rogaland is the Internet auction sites and shops which sell the factories’ goods. Signed works by Turi Gramstad Oliver, Kari Nyquist, Gro Pedersen Claussen, Anne Lofthus and Inger Waage are among those who have created great interest among collectors, both national and international. Because many of the products were exported, they are collectables found on international Net auction sites.

Even the teachers are on her side. Training, studying and even becoming the first female student council president of the school, Misaki has gained a reputation, among the male students body as an uptight boy-hating demon dictator and as a shining hope for the teachers and fellow female students. However, despite her tough-as-nails appearance, she secretly works part-time at a maid café in order to support her family. Unfortunately, her secret is soon discovered by Takumi Usui, a popular boy at Seika High.

Drama CDs.
A drama CD for "Kaichō wa Maid-sama" was released in Japan./
Reception.
Connie C. described the manga as being "pretty entertaining, if shallow", feeling that it was sexist towards both genders, but lighthearted enough in this that offense could not be taken, saying that she would continue to read the series as a "guilty pleasure". Deb Aoki feels that the maid cafe setting provides both fanservice and a vehicle to critique gender roles. In contrast, Johanna Draper Carlson feels that the story is "a male fantasy, where the scary, strong, smart, self-possessed girl turns out to secretly be subservient to men. It’s sort of funny to read, until you think about what its real messages are." Robert Harris notes the formulaic beginnings, but feels that the characters make the manga enjoyable. Leroy Douresseaux found the character of Takumi unconvincing, describing him as a "cheap plot trick" to rescue Misaki when needed. Carlo Santos felt the premise was "otaku-tastic", but appreciated the lack of fanservice and panty shots in the maid cafe scenes, feeling that these marked the series as being shōjo. He also appreciated the chemistry between the leads, and the humour, but noted the stereotypical plot, and criticises the layouts and overly-talky characters. Connie C. described the second volume as reminding her that plot devices are plot devices because "they work wonderfully if used right", feeling that the sense of humour and character interactions lifted the stereotypical plots of the school sports day and rich new classmates.

The LG VX8100 is a mobile phone that was available through Verizon Wireless in 2005 and 2006. It used Verizon's EV-DO network and was one of the first phones to support V CAST service. It also featured Bluetooth capability, stereo speakers, and a MiniSD slot. 
Reception.
The VX8100 received mix reviews. Some compared it unfavorably to its predecessor, the VX8000, because the VX8100 was heavier, had a shorter battery life, a protruding antenna, a smaller screen, and did not include an analog compatibility mode Another source of criticism was that there were four different firmware versions of the phone—none of which were marked on the box—which made for inconsistent consumer experiences. 
However, Laptop magazine rated it 4 out of 5 stars, mostly based on its multimedia functionality and faster data rate.
Based on call quality, features, and durability the VX8100 continues to retain a great fan base years after initial launch.

CIDG-FM

CIDG-FM, branded as DAWG FM, is a Canadian radio station which broadcasts Canada's first and only all blues and blues-rock format, operating on 101.9 FM in Ottawa, Ontario. The station's antenna mast is located in Ottawa atop a building on Montreal Road in Ottawa's east end.
Owned by Frank Torres and Ed Torres of Skywords Traffic Network the station was authorized by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on August 26, 2008.
The station began testing its signal on June 1, 2010 and launched at 7:30 AM on June 7, 2010. That morning, The DAWG'S Breakfast with Geoff Winter featured Max Keeping and eventual Juno winning Ottawa band MonkeyJunk as special guests. 
Since its inception, DAWG FM has participated in many community events in the Ottawa area, including the creation of the first annual Class Axe Guitars Calabogie Blues and Ribfest. 
Controversy.
CRTC commissioner Michel Morin took the unusual step of issuing a dissenting opinion, in which he stated that Corus Entertainment's competing proposal for a new talk radio station served a greater need in the market. In his dissent, Morin called attention to the fact that very few other radio stations in North America offer a primarily blues-based format, suggesting that there may not be sufficient audience demand to support the station in the long term.
On November 21, 2008, federal Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages James Moore issued a statement calling on the CRTC to review its approval of both CIDG and Astral Media's new classic hits station CJOT-FM. Moore asked the commission to assess whether the francophone population of the Ottawa-Gatineau area was sufficiently well-served by existing French radio services, and to consider licensing one or more of the French language applications — which included a Christian music station, a community radio station and a campus radio station for the Université du Québec en Outaouais — in addition to or instead of the approved stations.
In the resulting round of hearings, Torres proposed that a new francophone station could be licensed on 94.5 FM, although such a station would be second-adjacent to Astral's CIMF-FM. Industry Canada subsequently aired a testing signal on 94.5 in May 2009 to determine whether the signal could be used without affecting CIMF. The test found that the signal could be used without causing significant interference to CIMF, and Astral consequently gave its consent to the use of the frequency as long as the company retained its license for CJOT.
On April 8, 2010, CIDG-FM received approval to decreasing the average effective radiated power from 1,300 watts to 934 watts, by increasing the maximum ERP from 3,000 watts to 4,500 watts (effective height of antenna above average terrain of 98 metres), and by relocating the antenna. 
Signal Boost.
Though DAWG quickly gained a devoted following of fans, the limitations of the weak signal on the 101.9 frequency meant that many people in the National Capital Region could not tune into the station. In order to penetrate the concrete buildings in downtown Ottawa and to reach outlying communities, the station applied to have their signal boosted. 
On April 19, 2011, Torres Media Ottawa Inc. received CRTC approval to change the authorized contours of the English language commercial radio programming undertaking CIDG-FM Ottawa, by increasing the effective radiated power (ERP) from 934 to 1,793 watts (maximum ERP from 4,500 to 5,500 watts with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 98 metres). 
Sister Stations.
On November 9, 2011, Frank Torres submitted an application to the CRTC to operate a new radio station at Uxbridge, Ontario. On April 3rd, the CRTC approved the new station that will operate a classic hits format at 105.5 MHz.

Spring Garden Tunnel

The Spring Garden Tunnel at in Spring Garden, California is the longest of 34 tunnels on the Feather River Route (cf. Chilcoot Tunnel) and crosses under the drainage divide between the East Branch North Fork Feather River (north portal, ) and the Middle Fork Feather River (south portal, ).
History.
The Western Pacific Railroad (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad) built the tracks along the Feather River in 1909 to complete the Feather River Route, a San Francisco Bay Area - Salt Lake City route competing with the Southern Pacific's route over Donner Pass.
While significantly longer, the Feather River Route was preferred by some over the Donner Pass route (elevation about 7,000 ft / 2,134 m) over the Sierra Nevada mountains, because the former's summit under Beckwourth Pass is at a lower elevation (about 5,000 feet / 1,524 m) and most of the route follows a gentler grade along the Feather River.
The tunnel was designated one of Plumas County's "7 Wonders of the Railroad World," and the north portal is 0.15 miles west on Railroad Street, then 0.35 miles SSE along a fair-condition dirt road from Spring Garden, California.

Dhanmondi Cricket Academy

Dhanmondi Cricket Academy is a Bangladeshi cricket team who play in the Dhaka Metropolis Second Division Cricket League. The club has been a professional cricket club since promotion from Dhaka Metropolis Third Division Cricket League in 2006-2007.
Hafez Muhammad Zakaria is the president of the club, which is managed by Toyob Afzal and coached by Sadiquzzaman Pintu. Its home ground is the Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium in Dhanmondi Road #4.
The club was formed by residents of Dhanmondi.
History.
1990s.
Since the late 1980s, the children’s park located in Dhanmondi Road 4 was in the grasp of drug dealers, sex workers, hijackers, etc. and as time wore on, the situation got worse. There was a time in the early and mid-1990s when the local residents were afraid to venture towards that park even during broad daylight after several incidents of hijacking and murder.
A slum developed and sex workers were usually seen residing in the park. The seesaws, slides and swings provided by Dhaka City Corporation became so rusted and inoperative that it was hard to find a single child in the park. Drugs were sold so rampantly, the parents of the area were scared even if their children were passing by the children’s park at that time.
Early days.
The locals realised that the children’s park would be lost and after taking permission from the local Ward Commissioner, the seesaws, swings, etc. were removed and some keen cricketers started practicing. Soon, DCA (a registered academy recognised both by the Government of Bangladesh and Bangladesh Cricket Board) was developed. In a roundtable meeting of The Daily Star few years ago, speakers lauded the efforts of this community. In 2002, the daily’s senior reporter Morshed Ali Khan praised DCA on its work during a cricket tournament at the park in its sports page.

Inger Waage

Inger Waage, (1923–1995), was an industrial ceramist at the Norwegian producer of earthenware, Stavangerflint AS.
Biography.
She was born in Stavanger on the West coast of Norway. In 1943 she was accepted as a student at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry in Oslo to study ceramics for three years. After graduation in 1946, she moved back to Stavanger and started her own ceramic workshop.
Inger Waage became the first leader of a new established department for handicraft products at Stavangerflint AS in 1953. By 1955 her works were recognised by the market to such a degree that the company had to expand the production capacity by establishing an "I.W department", with up to ten assistant artists to cope with the orders of hand painted ceramic objects from the UK, US and other countries.
In 1968 Stavangerflint A/S merged with Figgjo Fajanse AS. The main office and the leadership of the artistic functions were moved to Figgjo. Inger Waage continued her work at the Stavanger branch for eleven more years, and was also a member of the company's artistic team, until 1979 when the branch in Stavanger was closed down and Inger Waage left the company. She died in Stavanger, aged 72 years.
Works.
Inger Waage's works may be divided into five main categories:
Inger Waage is best known for her hand-painted decorative objects of art from the 1950s. Inger Waage's decorative design for tableware became an important part of her work and of the collection of Stavangerflint. From among her most renowned designs are: "Flamingo – Bambus", "Flamingo –Chef", "Sera", "Smørbukk", "Senja" and "Kon Tiki". "Bambus" is represented at The National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo. Her work is also permanently exhibited at the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History in Bygdøy, Oslo.
Souvenirs designed by Inger Waage are nearly always signed and are easily recognised by her drawing style. Nearly every town and places of interest in Norway and Denmark has its I.W. signed souvenir, and some towns and places in US are also represented.

ISMACryp

The ISMA Encryption and Authentication, Version 1.1 specification (or ISMACryp) specifies encryption and message authentication services for MPEG-4 over RTP streams. It was defined by the Internet Streaming Media Alliance and published on September 15, 2006.
The ISMA Encryption and Authentication, Version 2.0 specifies content encryption, message authentication (integrity) services, an RTP payload
format and a file format for pre-encrypted content for ISMA 1.0, ISMA 2.0 and more generally any media that can be stored as elementary stream in an ISO base media file format (ISO/IEC 14496-12). The specification was published on 15 November 2007. ISMACryp specification defined extensions over the ISO base media file format, which were registered by the registration authority for code-points in "MP4 Family" files. The ISMACryp 2.0 specification in an informative "Annex F" provides guidelines on how ISMACryp can be used together with the key and rights management system of OMA DRM v2 (Open Mobile Alliance DRM). The Packetized OMA DRM Content Format is almost based on ISMACryp format.
There are two alternatives to ISMACryp, SRTP and IPsec, that can also be used to provide service and content protection. The difference between the three is at what level encryption is done. Whereas ISMACryp encrypts MPEG-4 access units (that are in the RTP payload), SRTP encrypts the whole RTP payload, and IPsec encrypts packets at network level. 
The ISMACryp specification does not mandate a cipher but AES in Counter Mode, the default encryption and authentication
transform in the specification, is the de facto cipher used by ISMACryp implementations.

David Carson Berry

David Carson Berry (born March 28, 1968) is an American music theorist and historian, writer about music, and college professor. Among his diverse research interests are American popular music of the 1920s-60s, including a focus on Irving Berlin and Jimmy Van Heusen; the theory and aesthetics of music of the mid-eighteenth through mid-twentieth centuries, including a focus on Igor Stravinsky; and Schenkerian theory and its reception history in the U.S.
Berry was born in 1968, in Paragould, Arkansas, as the only child of Jimmy Shelton Berry and Melba Moore Berry. The family moved to Marked Tree, Arkansas in 1969. The parents taught in the town's only school district: the father, social studies; and the mother, home economics. Berry completed primary and secondary school there, graduating as the valedictorian of Marked Tree High School in 1986.
Berry attended Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, Arkansas, where music composition was his major and trombone performance was a secondary interest; he graduated "magna cum laude" in 1990, with a Bachelor of Music degree in composition. He next attended Memphis State University (now University of Memphis), where he initially began working on a masters degree in composition. He changed his focus while there, and graduated with a Master of Music degree in music theory in 1993. His thesis, completed under the advisement of David Russell Williams, was entitled "Portrait with Retouches: The Adaptation and Transformation of Stravinsky's "Pulcinella" Finale." He was subsequently accepted as a doctoral student and teaching fellow at the University of North Texas; he was enrolled there from 1993 to 1995, and studied with John Covach, Graham Phipps, Janna Saslaw, David Schwartz, and others. He left the program after spring 1995, in order to apply to other schools. In fall 1996, he began doctoral studies at Yale University. While there he studied with Kofi Agawu, Gianmario Borio, Allen Forte, Michael Friedmann, David Kopp, Patrick McCreless, Robert Morgan, Claude V. Palisca, and Leon Plantinga. After his coursework was completed he taught "Elementary Studies in Analysis and Composition I and II," for which he was awarded a "Prize Teaching Fellowship" in 2001, in recognition of "outstanding performance and promise as a teacher." His dissertation, completed in 2002 under the advisement of Forte, was entitled "Stravinsky's 'Skeletons': Reconnoitering the Evolutionary Paths from Variation Sets to Serialism." Work on it was facilitated by a fellowship from the Whiting Foundation, and upon its completion the dissertation was accepted as "distinguished" by the Yale Music Department.
After receiving his Ph.D. in music theory in 2002, Berry was appointed a lecturer at Yale for the 2002-03 academic year. In fall 2003, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Music Theory at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music; and in 2009 he was granted tenure and promoted to Associate Professor.
In 2006 Berry was awarded the Society for Music Theory's "Emerging Scholar Award" for "The Meaning(s) of 'Without': An Exploration of Liszt's "Bagatelle ohne Tonart"," "19th-Century Music" 27/3 (2004): 230-262. The article was described by the SMT awards committee as a "careful and detailed analytical study, of a single piece with a tantalizing title, places the music within the framework of 19th-century musical thought, in particular the evolving theories of chromaticism that would eventually lead to Schoenberg's radicalism and beyond. The author shows that Liszt's 'Bagatelle without Tonality' is not so much 'without tonality' as a piece without the fulfillment of a tonic. In doing so, he makes a telling contribution to what many consider the central story of music theory: the story of the circumvention of tonality."
To date, Berry has published 19 articles and reviews, and has delivered roughly 30 papers on diverse topics at various academic venues in the U.S. and Europe. His book, "A Topical Guide to Schenkerian Literature: An Annotated Bibliography with Indices" (Hillsdale, NY: Pendragon Press, 2004), is the largest reference work devoted to writings about the music theorist Heinrich Schenker and his approach to analysis; it contains 3600 entries, representing the work of 1475 authors.
Berry is currently the editor of "". He is a past editor of "Theory and Practice" (the journal of the Music Theory Society of New York State), and a past reviews editor of the "Journal of Music Theory".

Federation of Scouts of Russia

The Federation of Scouts of Russia, or FSR (), was one of several national Scouting organizations formed in the Russian Federation following independence from the Soviet Union.
History.
The federation was formed on November 27, 1991. It comprised three regional Scouting organizations that had grown out of the independent Association for the Revival of Russian Scouting (AVoRS): the Scout Association of St. Petersburg, The Union of Scouts of Moscow, and the Siberian Association of Scouts. The federation's president was Arkady Nikitchenko.
In August 1994 the FSR held the First International Russian Jamboree at Lake Ladoga in northwest Russia near St. Petersburg. Over 3,500 Scouts from around the world were in attendance. A Second International Jamboree that took place north of Moscow in 1997 with approximately 4,000 participants was organized by FSR in conjunction with the Organization of Russian Young Pathfinders (ORYuR).
On April 29, 1998, the FSR joined with ORYuR, along with the St. Vladimir Scouts, to form a new group called the National Organization of Russian Scouts – Pathfinder (NORS-R, or simply NORS). Their aim was to become accepted as the representative of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) in Russia. However, the WOSM rejected NORS's constitution as "undemocratic" and favored a rival organization, the All Russia National Scout Organization (ARNSO) — a group that had formed the day after NORS, joining such groups as the Federation of Orthodox Scouts (FOS), the Russian Union of Scouts (RUS), and several local Scouting organizations.

EFDA

The European Union has a strongly coordinated nuclear fusion research programme. At the European level, the so-called EURATOM Treaty is the international legal framework under which member states cooperate in the fields of nuclear fusion research.
The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) is an agreement between European fusion research institutions and the European Commission (which represents Euratom) to strengthen their coordination and collaboration, and to participate in collective activities in the field of nuclear fusion research.
In Europe, fusion research takes place in a great number of research institutes and universities. In each member state of the European Fusion Programme at least one research organisation has a "Contract of Association" with the European Commission. All the fusion research organisations and institutions of a country are connected to the program through this (these) contracted organisation(s). After the name of the contract, the groups of fusion research organisations of the member states are called "Associations".
History.
The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) was created in 1999.
Until 2008 EFDA was responsible for the exploitation of the Joint European Torus, the coordination and support of fusion-related research & development activities carried out by the Associations and by European Industry and coordination of the European contribution to large scale international collaborations, such as the ITER-project.
2008 has brought a significant change to the structure of the European Fusion Programme. The change was triggered by the signature of the ITER agreement at the end of 2006. The ITER parties had agreed to provide contributions to ITER through legal entities referred to as "Domestic Agencies". Europe has fulfilled its obligation by launching the European Domestic Agency called "Fusion for Energy", also called F4E, in March 2007.
With the appearance of F4E EFDA´s role has changed and it has been reorganised. A revised European Fusion Development Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2008 focuses on research coordination with two main objectives: to prepare for the operation and exploitation of ITER and to further develop and consolidate the knowledge base needed for overall fusion development and in particular for DEMO, the first electricity producing experimental fusion power plant being built after ITER.
Organisation.
EFDA has two locations, which each house a so-called Close Support Unit (CSU), responsible for part of EFDA's activities. The EFDA-CSU Garching is located in Garching, near Munich (Germany), and is hosted by the German Max-Planck Institut für Plasmaphysik. EFDA-CSU Culham is hosted by the CCFE laboratory in Culham (UK), home of the Joint European Torus facilities.
A large number of scientists and engineers from the associated laboratories work together on different projects of EFDA. The main task of the Close Support Units is to ensure that these diverse activities are integrated in a coordinated European Fusion Programme.
The EFDA management consists of the EFDA Leader (Dr. Francesco Romanelli) and the EFDA-Associate Leader for JET (Dr. Francesco Romanelli).
Activities.
In order to achieve its objectives EFDA conducts the following group of activities:
EFDA coordinates a range of activities to be carried out by the Associations in 7 key physics and technology areas. The implementation of these activities benefits from structures so called Task Forces and Topical Groups. The European Task Forces on Plasma Wall Interaction (PWI) and on Integrated Tokamak Modelling (ITM) set up respectively in 2002 and 2003. To strengthen the co-ordination in other key areas five Topical Groups have been set up in 2008: on Fusion Materials Development, Diagnostics, Heating and Current Drive, Transport and Plasma Stability and Control.

<doc id="19071871" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19071871" title="Heartland Parkway">
Heartland Parkway

The Heartland Parkway is a proposed toll road running from Polk County in central Florida to the Fort Myers–Naples area of southwest Florida, to be operated by Florida's Turnpike Enterprise. The proposed toll road would run approximately through rural portions of Polk, Hardee, Highlands, DeSoto, Glades, Lee, and possibly Collier counties. With cost estimates ranging from $3–8 billion, support for the construction of the parkway has ebbed and flowed. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was a proponent of this parkway, but his successor, governor Charlie Crist never expressed interest in its creation.
Need.
Florida is prone to hurricanes, and many widening projects and proposed highway corridors have focused on the need to facilitate large volumes of traffic away from the coast. At the present time, only Alligator Alley and several two-lane rural roads are able to transport the millions of people living in Collier, Lee, and Charlotte counties away from the coast.
Currently, the only viable north-south trucking route away from the coast is U.S. Highway 27. In Polk County, that highway is seen as the deadliest road in the county in part due to the large volume of truck traffic and high speeds. Its popularity amongst truckers stems from its intersections with several major highways and its avoidance of major cities. The Florida Department of Transportation claims that truck traffic in Florida will double by the year 2020.
The Heartland Environmental Agricultural Rural Task Force (HEART), an organization representing landowners pushing for the construction of the Heartland Parkway, has put forth some studies which they believe necessitate the construction of such a parkway.
Criticism.
Criticism for the proposed parkway has largely stemmed from concern for the environmentally sensitive areas the parkway would run though, and concern that rural areas it would traverse would be exploited by developers. Such criticism was discussed prior to the construction of the Suncoast Parkway, where fencing and special underpasses were constructed to protect wildlife and limited exits were constructed to deter exploitation by developers.

St. John's High School, Bangalore

St John's High School is a school in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is one of the oldest schools in the city. 
St John's High School was founded in 1854 and through all its 159 years has taken pride in the education of generation after generation of students, some from the same families.
Initially the school was built to serve the interests of the Anglo-Indian Community and the children of military personnel and government pensioners. Rev. R. Posnett, an Anglican clergyman, was sent to look after the spiritual interests of the Europeans and the Anglo Indians in the Cantonment area. In 1853 he constructed a small room on the Mootycherry Ridge, which later came to be known as St. John’s Hill. This room served as a chapel-cum-schoolroom. In the morning it was used as a school for children; in the afternoon as a library and a reading room and on Sundays for public worship.
A new school building was completed and opened in 1854. St. John’s School and St. John’s Church have thus been intrinsically linked together from their inception.
The school operated as a middle school until 1961. At that stage after completing the middle school examination of the erstwhile Mysore State, children transferred to other schools for their last two years. 
Top
The eagle takes wing
It was in 1962 that the institution was upgraded to a high school and joined the select band of schools taking the Anglo–Indian School Certificate. The first candidates were presented for that examination in 1970.
When the CSI came into being in 1947 the school and church came under the jurisdiction of the erstwhile Mysore Diocese and the property was transferred to the CSITA.
Until December 1962, the school was managed by the Pastorate Committee of St. John's Church but, from January 1963, it functioned under a constitution framed by the Pastorate Committee. In 1999, it was transferred to the management of the diocese and the new constitution came into effect from 1 May 2000. From June 2000, we introduced ISC (Std XI and Std. XII) in our school.
Top
A Historic Milestone
In May 2003, St. John’s High School entered its 150th year and celebrated this landmark event with a three-day carnival, ‘Vintage 150’ to support the 150th year projects of the school. We have a vision to enrich the facilities of the school and also to extend a helping hand to the educationally disadvantaged.
A round-up of special events marked the mood of celebration: ‘Tales and Tunes’, the Junior School Concert, St. John’s Inter-School Athletic Meet, ‘Theatrix 2003’, an Inter School Dramatics Competition, ‘Navrasa’, a Cultural Night featuring a blend of folk and tribal dances of India, and a one-day Cardiac Screening Camp for staff and parents.
2004 witnessed a gala get together of old students wherein we had the sesquicentennial crowning of Mr. & Ms. John. 'Robinhood and Friends', a musical and the Grand Musical night with Usha Uthap and Enoch marked the final of the 150th year celebration in 2005.
Top
A wider wingspan
150th year projects of the school
To commemorate 150 years of excellence in the field, we have undertaken two very important projects. The first project is the construction of an ultra modern library which will facilitate our students to gain wider knowledge of the world through updated reference books, encyclopedia and story books to suit all ages. The second is the introduction of a National Open School for the drop out children of our community and also starting “Improvement Classes” for the benefit of slow learners in our school.
St. John’s looks forward to the next 150 years with renewed vision and determination.
The school is managed by a duly constituted Board of Management. The Chairman of the Board is the Bishop of the Karnataka Central Diocese of the Church of South India. The Members of the Board are drawn from the fields of finance, education, administration, social services etc.
The school's motto is "Nil Desperandum, Semper Fidendum" which is Latin for "Never despair, always have faith".
St. John’s had some outstanding music teachers, among who was Ms Fewkes, who could pound out heavenly music on the piano. Her rendering of the School song in the early to mid sixties was a treat for the ears and soul.
St John’s was a co-educational Middle School (until 9th Std) till 1962 - being a feeder school to Bishop Cottons Boys/ Girls School. As a High School it limped along until Dec 1965 when the 3rd batch of High School students took the A.I.S.S.C exams (10th standard). When the results were announced, Peter Selvarajan their school topper obtained the First Rank in Karnataka ahead of the best students from the other English medium schools: Bishop Cottons, Baldwins, Clarence, St. Germain, Francis Xavier, and his photograph came out in the Bangalore Deccan Herald news paper. He was also awarded the National Merit Scholarship by the Govt. of India the following year. The school received a flood of congratulatory letters and applications for admission. The School was thus established among the leading English medium schools of Bangalore.

Kalinin K-4

__NOTOC__
The Kalinin K-4 was an airliner built in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s which was also adapted for use as a photographic survey aircraft and as an air ambulance. A further development of the K-1, it was a conventional high-wing, strut-braced monoplane with separate enclosed cabin and cockpit. Kalinin undertook the design to offer a locally-produced alternative to pioneering Ukrainian airline Ukrvozduhput, which was at that time flying Dornier designs. The structure was of mixed wood and metal construction, but with major assemblies designed in both wood and metal versions, allowing them to be interchanged. The design also featured a variable-incidence horizontal stabiliser, and the engine mounting was intended to facilitate the ready interchange of different powerplants. 
Development.
By May 1928, four pre-production machines were being constructed at the Kharkov Aviation Factory. While this work was proceeding, Dobrolyot placed an order with Ukrvozduhput for two photographic survey aircraft, a request that the latter undertook to fill with two specially equipped K-4s. These machines took priority at the factory, and differed from the passenger version in having a ventral hatch for one or two cameras mounted on the cabin floor, plus a self-contained darkroom. The air ambulance version was developed initially to exhibit at the 1928 Berlin Air Show, and examples would later see military service with Soviet forces in Finland during the Winter War.
In summer the same year, Soviet pilots evaluated the K-4 against a Dornier Merkur that was making a promotional tour. Encouraged by the positive feedback for his design, Kalinin obtained approval for a demanding flight between Kharkov, Baku, Tbilisi, and back. Piloted by Mikhail Artemevich Snegirev, a K-4 named "Червона Украина" (Chervona Ukraina - "Red Ukraine") made the trip between 22 and 24 August. This same pilot and aircraft would set a new aerial distance record almost exactly a year later, flying from Kharkov to Moscow to Irkutsk, then back to Moscow and Kharkov. Although the original intention had been to reach Vladivostok, Snegirev still covered in 73 hours.
Operational history.
Flight testing was concluded in July 1928, and the four pre-production machines were handed over to Ukrvozduhput. They were put into service on routes linking the Crimea and Caucasus, and another ten aircraft were ordered. The following year, services were expanded to Tehran in a joint service arrangement with Junkers Luftverkehr. On 1 May 1929, seven Ukrvozduhput K-4s flew in formation from Kharkov to Rostov, Sochi, Mineralnye Vody and Tbilisi. Service with the airline was short, however, as the K-4 demonstrated a poor safety record. Between 23 May and 24 August, K-4s were involved in fourteen accidents, including two in which passengers were killed. The first of these fatal accidents took place on 25 June, when K-4 (registered СССР-219) crashed after take-off from Sukhumi due to engine failure, killing two passengers. The second took place on 24 August when K-4 registered СССР-217 dove suddenly into the sea shortly after take-off from Sochi. The wooden wings of the aircraft enabled it to float long enough for rescuers to reach it, however it sank soon afterwards, taking one passenger and one of the rescuers with it. The rescuer who drowned was celebrated Latvian military commander Jan Fabricius, who had been Commander and the Commissioner of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. Although the subsequent investigation attributed the crash to pilot error, numerous manufacturing defects were discovered throughout the K-4 fleet, leading to their withdrawal from service shortly thereafter.
Dobrolyot's survey machines commenced operations in August 1928, and were soon joined by around a dozen examples of the airliner version, which were used on routes in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. The K-4 proved unsuitable for these conditions, with the hot conditions causing the aircraft's wooden structures (especially the wings) to deform. The costs of maintenance and repairs soon became prohibitive, and by Spring 1930, the aircraft were withdrawn. The type was evaluated for service on routes in the north, and one was used for the first passenger flight from Moscow to Tashkent, but nothing came of this. Eventually, the remaining aircraft were used for survey work in Siberia and the Urals.

Brett Cecil

Brett Aarion Cecil (born July 2, 1986) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball. Cecil was drafted as the 38th overall pick in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft by the Blue Jays. He pitched for DeMatha Catholic High School and the University of Maryland, College Park.
He first pitched in a professional league for the Class A Auburn Doubledays in 2007. In 2008, he had been promoted to the Dunedin Blue Jays, and later to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats, and finally to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs. He received an invitation to attend spring training with the Blue Jays in 2009, but began the season in Triple-A.
Although he pitches left-handed, he is usually right-handed; pitching is "the only thing he does left-handed".
Background.
Brett Aaron Cecil was born on July 2, 1986 in Dunkirk, which is in Calvert County, Maryland. He first starting playing baseball when he was 8 years old near his southern Maryland home. As he got older, his father would drive him more than 20 miles each way to White Marsh Park in Bowie, Prince George's County where there was more competition. As a teenager, he attended Dematha High School, also in Prince Georges County. Upon graduation from Dematha, he stayed in Prince George's County and attended the University of Maryland.
MLB career.
2009.
Cecil was called up to the Toronto Blue Jays on May 1, 2009, and made his major league debut on May 5 as the starting pitcher against the Cleveland Indians at home. In that game, Cecil pitched six innings, giving up two runs, one earned, and six hits but was credited with a no-decision in a game Toronto eventually won. His next start was May 10 against the Oakland Athletics, pitching 8 scoreless innings to earn his first Major League win. Cecil defeated the Chicago White Sox, keeping Toronto in first place, but then gave up five home runs to the Boston Red Sox on May 21, losing his first game, as Toronto went on a nine-game losing streak and dropped out of first place. Cecil was returned to AAA after losing to Boston, and then pitched solidly for the Las Vegas 51s. Continued injury problems for Blue Jays' pitchers led to Cecil being recalled to the major leagues on June 18, and he started against the Washington Nationals on June 20, filling in for the injured Casey Janssen and Roy Halladay, pitching 7 innings while allowing 3 earned runs in a no-decision, in a game Toronto lost in twelve innings.
2010.
Originally not making the rotation for the Blue Jays, Cecil was called up early in the season and became a regular in the Jays rotation along with Ricky Romero, Shaun Marcum and Brandon Morrow. On May 3, 2010, he took a perfect game into the seventh inning against the Cleveland Indians, but walked Grady Sizemore with one out. Then, two batters later, he allowed a single to Jhonny Peralta which scored Sizemore from second to end his no-hitter and his shutout. He ended up going 8 innings, allowing one hit, 2 walks, one run, and 10 strikeouts. Despite not making the original team out of spring training he led the team in wins with 15, along with a much improved 4.20 ERA.
2011.
To start the 2011 season, Cecil went 1–2 with a 6.86 ERA, which led to the Blue Jays optioning him to Triple-A, in order to make room for Chris Woodward on the 25-man roster. He was later recalled in late June and lost in his first start, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. On July 24, he pitched his first complete game shutout against Texas Rangers. Cecil finished the 2011 season with a 4–11 record and an ERA of 4.73.
2012.
Cecil did not make the Blue Jays roster out of spring training and was assigned to Triple-A Las Vegas. After Kyle Drabek was placed on the disabled list, Cecil was called up on June 15. After posting a 2–4 record with a 5.72 ERA through 9 starts, Cecil was demoted to Triple-A Las Vegas 51s on August 4.
2013.
Cecil started the 2013 season in the Blue Jays bullpen. On June 19, 2013 against the Colorado Rockies, Cecil broke the club record for facing the most consecutive batters without allowing a hit, set by David Cone with 36. Cecil's hitless streak ended after 43 consecutive batters on June 25, against former teammate Yunel Escobar and the Tampa Bay Rays. On July 6, 2013, Cecil was named to the AL All-Star Team, which was special for Cecil considering the fact that it is rare for a mid relief pitcher to earn an All-Star appearance. Cecil pitched of an inning in the All-Star Game, striking out Domonic Brown on 3 pitches. On July 31, Cecil recorded his first career save in a 5–2 win over the Oakland Athletics. He was placed on the disabled list on September 17, ending his 2013 campaign with a 5–1 record, 2.82 earned run average, and 70 strikeouts over 60 innings.
2014.
In January 2014, Cecil filed for salary arbitration with Toronto, but came to terms on a 1-year, $1.3 million contract on January 17.

Phototrophic prokaryotes

Phototrophic prokaryotes are bacteria or archaea that obtain energy from light. Phototrophic prokaryotes may utilize a variety of carbon sources, depending on the metabolic pathways available to the bacterium. Most phototophic organisms are also autotrophs, obtaining carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide in a process called photosynthesis. 
Among phototrophic bacteria the phylum Cyanobacteria are perhaps the most well kown, and probably the most important. Cyanobacteria are responsible both for the oxygenation of the earth in what is now known as the Great Oxygenation Event, and for the photosynthetic capabilities of plants wherein organelles known as Chloroplasts harvest light energy used by the plants in photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are revealed as descendants from cyanobacteria and it is theorized that cyanobacteria were adopted as organelles by early eukaryotes through endosymbiosis.

Angel (Natasha Bedingfield song)

"Angel" is a pop song performed by Natasha Bedingfield for her second North American album "Pocketful of Sunshine". It was released as the album's third single in North America on 11 August 2008. The song was produced by Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, hence the "Darkchild forever" line at the beginning of the song, he also sings the chorus.
The song is written in the key of B Minor and set in 4/4 time. Bedingfield's vocals range from F#3 to C#5. It utilizes a prominent spelling out of the word 'angel' as its hook. In the song, Bedingfield sings of being a guardian angel of sorts for her companion, stating in the chorus, "I'll be your A-N-G-E-L." On 18 September 2008 she performed the song live on "America's Got Talent". This song is featured in the rhythmic, singing video game "Boogie Superstar", but only as the Moto Blanco Club Remix and as an online exclusive song.
Critical reception.
Chris Williams of "Billboard" praised "Angel", noting that it takes on "a decidedly more urban slant", and saying, "Vocally, Bedingfield has no difficulty adjusting to the production, confidently delivering with sass and swagger." He also thought the track would do well, claiming, "With angelic harmonies throughout, a catchy chorus with a fun spell-out of "a-n-g-e-l" and a sing-rap bridge, Bedingfield is on her way again to the airwaves' high heavens."
Chart performance.
"Angel" debuted on the "Billboard" Hot 100 at #93, the chart week of 4 October 2008. It has debuted on the Pop 100 at #91, and has climbed to #35. Since its release date it has been one of the most added tracks at U.S. Mainstream Top 40 radio. It has already climbed to #25 on BDS CHR/Top 40 chart. The song debuted at #96 on the Canadian Hot 100 and peaked at #41.
Music video.
Phil Griffin shot the music video for the song. The video features Bedingfield in several different rooms and outfits, with multiple versions of her suddenly appearing and then disappearing. The music video uses the Radio Edit of the song which alters the bridge: the lyrics "I wish somebody would disrespect my man, they gon' have to come see me. I go hard for my baby..." being changed to ""if someone ever should" disrespect my "love", they gon' have to come see me. I "fight" hard for my baby..."

Monogatari (series)

Plot and setting.
The "Monogatari" series revolves around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student, who's almost human again after briefly becoming a vampire. One day, a classmate of his, the reclusive Hitagi Senjōgahara, falls down the stairs into Koyomi's arms. He discovers that Hitagi weighs nothing, in defiance of physics. Despite being threatened by her to keep away, Koyomi offers his help and introduces her to Meme Oshino, a strange middle-aged man living in an abandoned building, who cured him of being a vampire. Once Koyomi helps solve Hitagi's problem, she agrees to become his friend.
As the series progresses, Koyomi finds himself involved with other girls, each afflicted by different "oddities", including the ghost of a child called Mayoi Hachikuji, his underclassman Suruga Kanbaru, Nadeko Sengoku, a friend of his sisters, his classmate Tsubasa Hanekawa and his own younger sisters Karen and Tsukihi. To deal with the spectres, Koyomi relies on guidance from Oshino and, later, from Shinobu, the same vampire who attacked him, now with the appearance of an eight-year-old girl.
Most heroines have an item which symbolises their spectres, such as Hitagi's stapler (the claw of a crab), Mayoi's backpack (the shell of a snail), Suruga's arm (the arm of a monkey), Nadeko's hat and jacket (the head and skin of a snake), and Karen's black and yellow suit (the colors of a bee).

Hardwicke Knight

Frederick Hardwicke Knight (12 July 1911, Stoke Newington, England – 25 August 2008, Dunedin, New Zealand) was a prominent author and photographer from Broad Bay, New Zealand. An acknowledged expert on the history of southern New Zealand, he wrote many books related to early Dunedin and Otago.
Knight spent his formative years in England and in France, where he travelled in the 1920s, before becoming a travelling photographer working throughout Europe, notably spending time as a photojournalist in Stalinist Russia. A conscientious objector, Knight did not serve in the military in World War II, instead being part of the emergency medical services, working under Dunedin-born surgeon Harold Gillies.
In 1948, Knight was appointed Director of Medical Photography at Enfield Hospital in England, and in 1957 he emigrated to New Zealand, taking up a position as head of the Medical Photography Department at Otago Medical School. Here he helped develop important photographic techniques for diagnosing eye problems, and in 1965 he was elected president of the New Zealand Institute of Medical Photographers.
Knight was long interested in historical photography, and published numerous books on the subject, starting with "Photography in New Zealand a social and technical history" (1971). Other notable books include "Dunedin then" (1974), another book on Dunedin historical photography ("Princes Street by gaslight", 1977), and the seven volume series "Otago cavalcade", published between 1983 and 1985. He also wrote several biographies of early New Zealand photographers, notably one of the Burton Brothers ("Burton Brothers : photographers", 1980) and "New Zealand photographers : a selection" (1981), and other books on local history such as "The ordeal of William Larnach" (1981) and "Buildings of Dunedin: an illustrated architectural guide to New Zealand's Victorian city" (co-written by Niel Wales, 1988). He also produced a volume of his own images ("Hardwicke Knight - photographer") in 1983.
Knight was an avid collector and documenter of local history, his home at Broad Bay on Otago Peninsula becoming a virtual museum. A significant part of Knight's collection of over 20,000 items, specifically his collection of works by the Burton brothers and a collection of vintage photographic equipment, was acquired by the New Zealand national museum Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in 1991.

High Jump (game)

High Jump is a two-player strategy board game from Somalia. It is related to draughts and Alquerque as pieces hop over one another for capture. However, pieces move and capture orthogonally and not diagonally. Moreover, the game is played on a 5×5 square board. An interesting feature of High Jump is that the middle square offers a kind of sanctuary; a piece occupying the middle square cannot be hopped over and captured. The same board is used in the game Seega.
Goal.
A player wins, if all of their opponent's pieces are captured.
Equipment.
A 5×5 square board is used. The middle square can be marked with an "X" or any special marking. Each player has twelve pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces.

Francis Holyoake

Francis Holyoake (1567 – 13 November 1653) was a lexicographer, born at Nether Whitacre, Warwickshire, in 1567.
About 1582 he studied as a commoner at Queen’s College, Oxford, though it does not appear that he took a degree. Afterwards he taught school, first at Oxford, and then in Warwickshire. In February 1604 he was instituted to the rectory of Southam, Warwickshire, In 1625 he was elected a member of the convocation. In 1642 he was forced from his house by the parliamentarians, his wife was so ill-used as to hasten her death, his servant was killed, and his estate of ₤300l per annum was sequestered, so that he and his family were obliged to subsist on charity. He died on 13 November 1653, aged 86, and was buried in the church of St. Mary at Warwick.
Francis Holyoake compiled a "Dictionarie Etymologocall", which was annexed to "Riders Dictionarie correct", 2 pts., 8vo, London, 1617. The work was re-issued in 1626, 4to, with additions by N.Gray, and in 1640, 4to. But Holyoake had meanwhile contributed so much to the work that a fourth edition was published as almost his own, with the title "Dictionarium Etymologicum Latinum", &c., 3 pts., 4to, London, 1633. The sixth edition is stated to be "compositum et absolutum a Francisco de Sacra Quercu", 4to, 1648. His son Thomas made great additions to the work, but, dying before he could complete the edition, it was published by Thomas’s son Charles, as "A large Dictionary in three parts", fol., London 1677–1676.
Francis Holyoake presented a manuscript to Queen’s College library, entitled "Huguccionis, seu Huguitionis, Pisani, ep. Ferrariensis, Lexicon alphabeticum", &c. (Coxe, Cat. of Oxford MSS., pt. i. pp. 76–7).

In-water Survey

In-water Survey (referred to by various Classification Societies as IWS, BIS, etc.) is a method of surveying the underwater parts of a ship while it is still afloat instead of having to dry-dock it for examination of these areas as was conventionally done.
For cargo ships, two surveys are required within a period of five years. One of these can be an in-water survey, provided the ship is eligible for it.

Red Faction (series)

Red Faction is a series of science fiction shooter video games developed by Volition, Inc. and published by THQ. Originating in 2001, the "Red Faction" games have spanned Windows, Mac OS and many consoles, including the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The "Red Faction" series has been heavy on its thematic undertones throughout the games. One of the more outstanding themes of the series is a revolutionary socialist undertone. From the miners rebellion featured (in separate ways) in "Red Faction" and "Red Faction: Guerrilla", to the overthrown monarchy of "Red Faction II", this has been a central theme since the games' inception in 2001.
Gameplay.
The series has had two unique styles of gameplay, the first is a traditional first person shooter element which was used by the first two games in the series, while the second is a third person style of open world gameplay which was first used in "Red Faction: Guerrilla" and the "Red Faction: Armageddon". Both styles though share a common element which is the series' unique environmental destruction features, this was enhanced in "Red Faction: Guerrilla" when it was applied to every building in the game making the game's entire environment destructible.
The first two games were traditional first person shooters with unique environmental destruction features that were praised in both games. The games include vehicles, pistols, rifles, explosives, and other traditional shooter weapons and features. While the first two games did not re-invent the first person shooter, their Geo-mod Engine and rebellious story made both games a new step for the genre.
Rather than the traditional first person shooter style of the first two games, both "Guerrilla" and "Armageddon" utilize a third person style of gameplay. Guerrilla takes place in an Open world environment on the planet of Mars allowing players to free roam across the environment. Armageddon is a more linear experience, largely moving through corridors and caverns from objective to objective. In the games, all environments are fully destructible which means that every single building in the game can be destroyed. Players are usually equipped with four weapons, the primary weapon is a Sledgehammer with three more weapons of the player's choice. These weapons are mainly purchased using salvage, the main currency of the game, with the exception of the remote charges and assault rifle, both of which are given to the player by default at the start of the game. Purchasable weapons include an Arc Rifle, Grinder, Rocket Launcher, Proximity Mines and a Nano Rifle. Players go around completing missions for the Red Faction and perform Guerilla actions to liberate various sectors of Mars from the control of the Earth Defense Force.
Games.
"Red Faction" (2001).
"Red Faction" is the first game in the Red Faction franchise that was originally released in mid-2001 and later re-released for other platforms. Red Faction was also the first game to run on the Geo-Mod engine that allowed for unparalleled environmental destruction.
"Red Faction" takes place on Mars in the year 2070. The protagonist, Parker, is a miner who came to Mars seeking a better life away from Earth. Instead, he finds that the Ultor Corporation abuses the workers and forces them to endure hazardous living conditions. A plague of an unknown origin sweeps through the colony, but Ultor does nothing to halt its propagation or to provide for the sick.
The story begins with Parker witnessing another miner being brutally killed by an Ultor guard. Parker decides to fight back by aiding the mysterious rebellion called “Red Faction”. As the story progresses, Parker, aided by a rebellious Ultor technician named Hendrix, and the leader of the rebellion, Eos, wreaks havoc on Ultor’s installations and learns more about the mysterious Plague.
Parker is eventually led to the lair of Dr. Capek, a deranged scientist who has developed mutants, nano-technology (developed more fully in "Red Faction II"), and the Plague itself. Parker chases Capek through his underground complex and Parker eventually traps Capek in "Capeks laboratory." Parker destroys Capek's "nanoshield" and in Capek's final moments, Eos bursts in telling Parker not to kill Capek. Capek reveals to Eos that there is a cure to the plague, and subsequently dies. Ultor calls in a band of mercenaries led by Col. Masako to stop Parker, Eos and the rest of Red Faction. After numerous events, including Parker's abduction of a high-level Ultor worker, Hendrix is killed by the mercenaries for being a traitor and helping the Red Faction.
For the finale, Parker fights his way through the mercenaries to confront Masako. After a long battle, Parker kills her and finds Eos tied down next to a bomb about to detonate. Parker quickly defuses the bomb and frees Eos. A cutscene shows the Earth Defense Force come to the rescue to stop Ultor’s oppression and help cure the Plague. Eos declares Parker a hero as the game ends.
"Red Faction II" (2002).
"Red Faction II" is the sequel to "Red Faction". The game was released in October 2002 for the PlayStation 2, and early 2003 for other platforms. "Red Faction II" is an earth based FPS that mostly deviated from the story set in "Red Faction", only keeping minor plot details. Many new features had been added to the original game's sequel. Among these are new and evolved weapons and improved visuals.
"Red Faction II" takes place on Earth in the year 2075. The protagonist, Alias, is a genetically enhanced super soldier formerly employed by the Ultor Corporation. Nanotechnology developed by Dr. Capek (see "Red Faction") has fallen into the hands of the EDF (who is now associated with Ultor) and many other terrorist groups. A dictatorship, “The Commonwealth,” has employed Alias to retrieve nanotechnology and other data.
Eventually the research is claimed for Victor Sopot, leader of the Commonwealth as well as the first antagonist of the game. As Sopot’s soldiers become more enhanced due to the recovered technology, the more he fears them. Sopot sends lessened troops to stop all remaining nanotech soldiers (including Alias). Alias allies with other soldiers who call themselves “The Squad”.
The Squad quickly fights off the Commonwealth and kills Sopot. As they return to the new Red Faction base, it is revealed that the Squad’s leader, Molov (as well as other squad members Quill and Repta), who is now the game's second antagonist, has turned on them and now assumes control of the Commonwealth. Molov is attacked by another Squad member, Tangier, which allows all remaining Squad members (Alias, and a Red Faction member, Echo) a chance to escape.
As the game continues, Alias fights alongside Red Faction members (including Echo, who is killed by Quill), and eventually hunts and kills Quill after she kills Echo. Alias then has his last Battle with the Primary enemy of the Red Faction on the docks before heading into a Sub with Tangier to head underneath of the Statue of Sopot. Alias proceeds to a Commonwealth nanotech laboratory where he fights off hordes of processed civilians as well as their new friends, the processed military soldiers. After multiple battles with the processed, he encounters Repta in a dangerous nanotech electro-chamber. After that, he eventually triggers an explosion to cause Repta to fall into the bottomless pit. Alias continues on and is told by Tangier to blow 3 containers. After that is finished, he meets a processed version of an old enemy, the nanotech enhanced Elite Guards. After fighting the processed version of Sopot Elite Guards/Leaders, he encounters a processed version of Repta (dubbed Repta+). He kills Repta+ and heads completely into the statue, which is unstable from the destruction of the nanolabs. Molov, the last remaining enemy, retreats to the top of Victor Sopot's statue, which is guarded by an army of both nano-military soldiers and Elite Guards. He attempts to flee from the statue with the nano-cell. Tangier is in pursuit of him while he is trying to defend himself with his army of processed soldiers and with his railgun against the two.
Shrike is seen with a new gunship and then betrays Molov, saying "Remember Molov, if we fight, then we finish them". Tangier manages to reclaim the nanotech cell from Molov's possession and escapes to the observation deck.
For the finale, Alias battles Molov on foot while Molov is in his battle armor with the help of Shrike and his new self-controlled gunship. He destroys his battle armor and they both fight each other in a gun-to-gun battle. After a long fight, Molov is defeated as the observation deck begins to collapse. Shrike, now loyal to The Squad again, saves Alias from the crumbling statue. Depending on the player’s “Heroic” rating, the plot has four separate endings. See "Red Faction II" for details.
"Red Faction: Guerrilla" (2009).
"Red Faction: Guerrilla" is the third installment of the "Red Faction" franchise. The game assumes a third person point of view and an open world to play in. The game was released on some platforms on June 2, 2009, seven years after its predecessor and featured a vastly different gameplay system.
Red Faction: Guerrilla takes place in 2120. The Earth Defense Force (EDF), the allies in the original "Red Faction", has become the main antagonist of Guerrilla. Earth's natural resources have run scarce, and as a result, its global economy has collapsed from rampant speculation of commodities and lack of production. Under pressure by Earth's corporations and leaders to acquire the resources of Mars at any cost and at a pace to meet Earth's high demand, the EDF has forced Martian society into a permanent state of unfree labour. The newly reformed "Red Faction" arises to rebel against the EDF, drive them off the planet, and begin fairer negotiations with Earth.
Alec Mason, the player character and a mining engineer, arrives on Mars to reunite with brother Daniel and begin a new life, only to learn to his surprise that Daniel is now a member of Red Faction. While on work detail, Daniel testifies about the EDF's cruelty to the Martian people and asks Alec to join their cause; he is soon after gunned down by an EDF gunship looking for him. Upon returning to find his housing and possessions seized by the EDF, Alec is convicted of being Red Faction. The commander of the EDF squad orders Alec shot, but Alec is then rescued by Red Faction guerrillas. He becomes a reluctant freedom fighter for the group alongside inventor "Sam" Samanya, rambling eccentric Randy Jenkins (who believes that Mars should be "purified"), and commander Hugo Davies. Between Davies' command and Alec's skill and bravery, the EDF are quickly driven out of an entire sector, "Parker", for the first time.
While the campaign against the EDF continues in the "Dust" sector, Alec is eventually assigned by Davies to routine surveillance of the "Marauders", a mysterious and violent warrior tribe living in the inhospitable "Badlands", in hopes of recovering stolen weapons. Instead, Alec winds up tracking them to an abandoned Ultor Corporation base that promptly comes under massive assault from the EDF. During the fracas, Alec steals a strange device called the "Nano Forge" and escapes. The EDF commander, Bertram Roth, responds by pulling out of the Dust Sector and ordering the artillery base in the "Free Fire Zone" to bomb the town of Dust into oblivion. Alec is then tasked with saving key members of Red Faction and vital information on the EDF from the bombardment, which he succeeds in doing.
Sam analyzes the Nano Forge and discovers it can create catastrophic nanites that can disintegrate any object. A prototype "Nano Rifle" is built from the device, which Alec uses to liberate other sectors, while Davies declares it a vital bargaining chip against the EDF. A successful suicide run against an EDF artillery base is commenced, allowing the group to begin hostilities against the EDF in their own central territories. Roth launches an all-out assault on the Red Faction's command center, resulting in the death of Davies. Only Sam, Alec and a handful of other rebels survive the assault; they learn afterward that the star ship Hydra, under the command of Admiral Lucius Kobel, is arriving to Mars to put an end to the Red Faction once and for all. They also plan to eliminate all life on the planet, as said by Kobel himself, calling the civilians "Expendable".
Sam declares that they will need support from the Marauders if the campaign against the EDF is to continue; when Alec remains dubious, she reveals that she is a former Marauder herself, joining the Red Faction because marauders were consumed with anger and hate, and did not want to be a part of the lifestyle they endure. The pair head to a Marauder stronghold to meet with their ruler, Vasha, Sam's sister. Sam requests the usage of the Marauders' particle accelerator technology, with plans on combining it with the Nano Forge to create a superweapon capable of destroying the Hydra. Vasha agrees in exchange for possession of the Nano Forge once the war is finished. While inside the Marauder stronghold, the player can also discover a "radio tag" found on an old corpse that implies the Marauders are the descendants of former Ultor Corporation scientists.
After capturing a broadcasting station and using it to regroup the Red Faction, Sam and Alec lead a successful final assault on the EDF's central command alongside teams of Red Faction and the Marauders, driving the EDF out of their own territory. The two groups converge on Mt. Vogel to begin utilizing the Marauder's accelerator; however, a surprise EDF blitzkrieg led by Roth wipes out the Marauder crew guarding the summit end of the accelerator and Vasha along with them. Alec singlehandedly storms the mountain, defeating Roth's entire army and personally killing Roth. Sam's plan succeeds and the accelerated Nano Forge is successful in vaporizing the Hydra in space. As the surviving people of Mars celebrate, Sam says the war is over, but Alec knows that the EDF will come back. While Sam says that will be awhile, Alec responds with "We'll be ready for 'em". Alec and Sam approach the crowds of civilians who cheer for them, and Alec raises his sledgehammer in the air, showing the sign of the Red Faction and their long-waited victory.
"Red Faction: Armageddon" (2011).
On June 4, 2010, first footage of "Red Faction: Armageddon" debuted in the form of a short teaser trailer on GameTrailers. THQ announced that the game would be shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010. On June 27, 2011, THQ announced it was dropping the long running "Red Faction" franchise and no more installments are in development. This is due to the poor sales over the latest game in the franchise, "Red Faction Armageddon".
To tie in with the release of "Red Faction: Armageddon", Volition released a downloadable mini-game. "Red Faction: Battlegrounds" is a top-down twin-stick vehicle-based shooter which is available via Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. The mini-game was produced by Juice Games for Volition. The release date was 5 April 2011, beta invites were sent to a select group of PlayStation Plus subscribers on September 21, 2010.
"Red Faction: Origins" is a feature-length television movie produced by Syfy that coincided with "Red Faction: Armageddon". The channel announced the film on April 16, 2010. Volition confirmed the title of the film and its May 2011 release date on July 19, 2010. The film is set in-between the events of "Red Faction: Guerrilla" and "Armageddon".
Future.
On December 19, 2012, THQ filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy leading to an auction of THQ's properties that was held on January 22, 2013. While developer Volition, Inc. was picked up by Deep Silver along with "Saints Row", Red Faction was not a part of the transaction. On April 22, 2013, Red Faction was purchased by Nordic Games in the final transaction of THQ's assets. A fan community has organized to petition for the development of a new title in the series.
"Saints Row".
In 2006 Volition began a series called "Saints Row". Many themes and plots cross-over between the two franchises, most notably the story of the Ultor Corporation's rise to power. This plot has been heavily featured throughout the series, most notably in "Saints Row 2"'s storyline which continues into its DLCs in which Ultor experiments with Nanotech in order to improve the lung capacity of miners (see "The Plague" in Red Faction), when asked where Ultor plans on mining, an Ultor employee answers, "You wouldn't believe me if I told you". In the second DLC package, the player character comments that as long as Ultor stops harassing the Saints, "they can go to Mars for all I care." In the same DLC there is a vehicle with the Red Faction: Guerilla logo as part of its identification when entering. The Ultor Corporation continues to make appearances throughout the series.
Reception.
The series as a whole has received positive reviews/previews from one game to the next. Some common flaws are that graphics are considered behind its time or unremarkable. Also, the scattered story and limited interactivity in the levels have also been criticized overall. On the positive side, the series has been deeply commended for its unique geometrical modification capabilities, intelligent AI, and prevalent storytelling themes.
Praised for its long play time, great gameplay, and smart AI, "Red Faction" was generally given average to great reviews by critics. The game was also criticized for its scattered story and mediocre graphics. GameSpot gave the game a great review saying, “It's a great big game with much to explore and enemies tough enough to make it worth playing through more than once.” GameSpot awarded the game with a 8.9, giving it a rating of “great”. Gamespy awarded the game an overall score of 89/100 and called the PC version, “the best and most well-rounded first-person shooter released in a long time.”
"Red Faction II"s short campaign and lack of online multiplayer has diminished reviews by many critics. However, redeeming features include dual wielding, great multiplayer(split screen), and improved graphics. For these and other reasons, GameSpot awarded the game an 8.3/10.0, earning it the rank of "Great".
IGN's positive side of their review called the game "a very solid, well-produced first-person shooter", but their complaints stated that: "Volition still shows some room for improvement when it comes to level design, spots of AI, and implementing the vast potential of the Geo-Mod concept". Despite their complaints, IGN gave "Red Faction II" a 9.2/10, an "Outstanding" ranking. The PC version of Red Faction II was far less well received, with IGN criticizing the port's average looking graphics and incredibly short, though enjoyable while it lasted single player mode.

John Deasy (MP)

John Deasy (1856 – 24 February 1896) was an Irish nationalist politician whose career ended in scandal after nine years as a Member of Parliament (MP).
Political career.
He was first elected to the United Kingdom House of Commons as an Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) MP for Cork City, taking the seat at a by-election on 23 February 1884 after the resignation of John Daly.
At the 1885 general election he stood in the new West Mayo constituency, winning the seat by an overwhelming majority (of 4790 to 131 votes) over his sole opponent, a candidate of the Irish Conservative Party. He was re-elected unopposed in 1886, and after joining the Anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation when the IPP split 1891, he was returned as an Anti-Parnellite with a huge majority at the 1892 general election.
Downfall.
Deasy's career ended in scandal. In July 1893, he was tried at the London County Sessions, on a charge of indecent assault against Ellen Lewis, a teenage servant employed at his London lodgings in 75, Warwick-street. Lewis testified that Deasy had pulled her onto the bed and tried to kiss her, but was interrupted by her employer, Mrs Kate Edith Postlethwaite (the landlady, who also gave evidence). Deasy told the court that Lewis had tripped and fallen onto the bed, and that he was helping her get up, but had offered to kiss her. Evidence of Deasy's character was offered by two MPs (Sir Thomas Grattan Esmonde and Justin McCarthy), and by Sir George Penrose, the former High Sheriff and Lord Mayor of Cork. The jury found Deasy not guilty of indecent assault, but guilty of common assault. He was ordered to pay a fine of £25 and costs.
On 17 July 1893, a few days after the completion of his trial, Deasy resigned his seat by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead. He died of tuberculosis in February 1896, aged only 39.

Henry Holyoake (1657–1731) was a headmaster of Rugby School for more than forty years in the 17th and 18th centuries.
Life.
Holyoake was probably born in Warwickshire in 1657, the son of Thomas Holyoake and Anne his wife, and the grandson of Francis Holyoake. He was elected to a choristership at Magdalen College, Oxford, which he resigned in 1676, having matriculated from that college on 12 March 1674. He became clerk and sub-librarian in 1676, appointments which he held until 1681. On 22 October 1678 he graduated B.A., proceeded M.A. on 4 July 1681, and was chaplain of his college from 1681 until 1690.
In 1687 he was elected headmaster of Rugby School. Despite the smallness of his salary and other disadvantages, he raised the school from insignificance, and was the first to engage an assistant master. He seems, however, to have unfortunately misunderstood the character of one of his best-known pupils, Edward Cave, whom he treated with undeserved severity, and eventually drove from the school. Cave, however, inserted a sympathetic obituary in the "Gentleman’s Magazine". 
Holyoake was instituted to the rectory of Bourton-upon-Dunsmore on 30 June 1698, to that of Bilton on 31 August 1705, and to that of Harborough Magna, all in Warwickshire, on 9 November 1712. In 1700 he gave £20 for Magdalen College Library. He died unmarried at Rugby on 10 March 1730–1731, and was buried in St. Mary’s Church, Warwick, where may be seen a quaint Latin inscription written by himself, which he directed to be engraved to his own memory as well as to that of his father and grandfather.
Holyoake’s establishment at Rugby was under the domestic management of his cousin Judith Holyoake, to whom he left a legacy on the express ground of her having been ‘very serviceable and seemingly kind’ to the boys. He bequeathed £30 to the daughter of Widow Harris, ‘his tripe-woman;’ the interest of £200 to the poor of Rugby after the death of his cousin, Elizabeth Holyoake; and all his books (since sold), together with the portraits of his father and grandfather (since lost), to Rugby School.

Mythological hybrid

Hybrids are mythological creatures combining body parts of more than one real species.
They can be classified as partly human hybrids (such as mermaids or centaurs), and non-human hybrids combining two or more animal species (such as the griffin or the chimera). Hybrids are often zoomorphic deities in origin who acquire an anthropomorphic aspect over time.
Partly human hybrids appear in petroglyphs or cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic, in shamanistic or totemistic contexts. Ethnologist Ivar Lissner theorized that cave paintings of beings combining human and animal features were not physical representations of mythical hybrids, but were instead attempts to depict shamans in the process of acquiring the mental and spiritual attributes of various beasts or "power animals". Religious historian Mircea Eliade has observed that beliefs regarding animal identity and transformation into animals are widespread. The iconography of the Vinca culture of Neolithic Europe in particular is noted for its frequent depiction of an owl-beaked "bird goddess".
Examples of theriocephaly in the Ancient Egyptian pantheon include jackal-headed Anubis, cobra-headed Amunet, lion-headed Sekhmet (see also Sphinx), falcon-headed Horus etc. Most of these deities also have a purely zoomorphic and a purely anthropomorphic aspect, both of which the hybrid representation seeks to capture at once. The hybrid iconography then develops as an attempt to represent both aspects. Similarly, the Gaulish "Artio" sculpture found in Berne shows a juxtaposition of a bear and a woman figure, interpreted as representations of the theriomorphic and the anthropomorphic aspect of the same goddess.
Non-human hybrids also appear in Ancient Egyptian iconography, as in Ammit (combining the crocodile, the lion and the hippopotamus). Mythological hybrids become very popular in Luwian and Assyrian art of the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age. The "angel" (human with birds' wings, see winged genie) the "mermaid" (part human part fish, see Enki, Atargatis, Apkallu) and the (Shedu) all trace their origins to Assyro-Babylonian art. In Mesopotamian mythology the "urmahlullu", or lion-man served as a guardian spirit, especially of bathrooms. The Old Babylonian Lilitu demon, particularly as shown in the Burney Relief (part woman part owl) prefigures the harpy/siren motif.
Luwian and Assyrian motifs are imitated in Archaic Greece, during the Orientalizing Period (9th to 8th centuries BC), inspiring the monsters of classical Greek mythology such as the Chimera, the Harpy, the Centaur, the Griffin, the Hippocamp, Talos, Pegasus, etc.
The motif of the "winged man" appears in the Assyrian winged genie, and is taken up in the Biblical Seraphim and Chayot, the Etruscan Vanth, Hellenistic Eros-Amor, and ultimately the Christian iconography of angels.
Assyrian hybrids also entered Persian art, as in the Faravahar or the Buraq.
The motif of otherwise human figures sporting horns may derive from partly goat hybrids (as in Pan and the Devil in Christian iconography) or as partly bull hybrids (Minotaur). The Gundestrup cauldron and the Pashupati figure have stag's antlers (see also Horned God, horned helmet). The Christian representation of Moses with horns, however, is due to a mistranslation of the Hebrew text of Exodus 34:29-35 by Jerome.
The most prominent hybrid in Hindu iconography is elephant-headed Ganesha. Both Nāga and Garuda are non-hybrid mythical animals (snake and bird, respectively) in their early attestations, but become partly human hybrids in later iconography.

SEAT Cupra GT

The SEAT Cupra GT is a GT race car made by SEAT and introduced in a world premiere first as a concept car on 24 April 2003 at the Barcelona Motor Show. The final version of the Cupra GT was presented later, produced on customer demand by the Spanish car manufacturer's SEAT Sport division in a limited series addressed to racing teams or individuals aiming to participate in GT races like the Spanish GT Championship.
The SEAT Sport division has worked with the SEAT Design Center in Sitges, in order to create the racer with the design essence of the SEAT Salsa and SEAT Tango concept cars. Thus the SEAT Cupra GT incorporates the brand's 'auto emoción' philosophy, featuring the distinctive Walter de Silva's curved 'Dynamic Line' descending on the sides of the car from the front to the rear.
Engine.
Being a sports car, it is powered by a 2,995 cc V6 twin turbo 4 valves/cylinder DOHC petrol Audi engine with an output of over and a peak torque of at 5250 rpm. The motor is placed longitudinally at rear central position and the output is being routed through a rear-wheel drive layout including a 6 speed sequential transmission.
Suspension, brakes and tires.
The Cupra GT, by the time it was presented as a concept car, was equipped with independent double wishbones with Öhlins coil shock absorbers, all-round ventilated disc brakes ( front, rear) with Brembo's AP Racing brake calipers painted in a dark titanium nuance, and tires (265/650 front, 285/680 rear) mounted to titanium coloured six double spoke 18' alloy wheels. Intended to run in GT races, the car's wheels were secured with a single bolt saving time during the wheel changes.
Performance.
The high performance of the Cupra GT is marked by the estimated top speed of , while the standard discipline of sprinting from a standing start to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) is being completed in 4.2 seconds.

Use It or Lose It

Use It Or Lose It is a weekly Irish television series broadcast on RTÉ One. Each episode features a well-known sportsperson who revisits their old youth team and sets about reforming them for one final game within six weeks. Eight former athletes featured in the eight-part series broadcast in summer 2008. The athletes are equipped with personal trainers, nutritionists, coaches and physios to aid the players, health problems are explored and professional coaches conduct regular weigh-ins, blood pressure and lung capacity testing and suggest workouts and diets suited to the individual physiques of each team member. Each programme also focused on a particularly unhealthy individual, typically one who was clinically obese, had high blood pressure and some other extreme health issues. Their journey to a healthier lifestyle became the focus of the show. The series is produced by Stirling.
Episode list.
Episode one.
The first episode centred on Sunderland A.F.C. chairman and former Irish international footballer Niall Quinn as he returned to Manortown United in West Dublin, a team he last played for twenty-five years ago. One of Quinn's team-mates, forty-year-old Kevin Swan, has his unhealthy lifestyle focused upon throughout the programme. The team must regain its fitness levels for one final match in six weeks.
Episode two.
The second episode centred on twelve times All-Ireland winner Angela Downey who returned to Lisdowney Camogie Club in Kilkenny, the team she last played for more than ten years previously. The episode focuses on Downey's former team-mate and best friend Noelle O'Driscoll who is now an unhealthy and overweight schoolteacher.
Episode three.
The third episode centred on the former Ireland rugby union captain Mick Galwey, who is the only person to win All-Ireland honours in both gaelic football and rugby. He returned to Currow GAA club in County Kerry. The episode focuses on Galwey's former midfield partner and former Kerry minor, the overweight Tim Brosnan.
Episode four.
The fourth episode centred on the former gaelic football All-Star winner Colin Corkery as he returned to Nemo Rangers in Cork, the minor team he played for seventeen years previously. The episode focuses on the physically fit but clinically obese Mick O'Brien.
Episode five.
The fifth episode centred on the former Liverpool captain and Irish international footballer Ronnie Whelan as he returned to Home Farm F.C. in North Dublin. The episode focuses on the team's right-back Michael Kennedy who was forced to surrender his soccer career due to persistent ankle injuries and developed a forty-a-day cigarette habit.
Episode six.
The sixth episode centred on the former Irish women's international rugbier Fiona Steed who returned to Shannon RFC in Limerick, the team she last played for in 2003. Team mate Rosie Brown's family life is impacting on her health.
Episode seven.
The seventh episode centred on Jerome Westbrooks, a native of Chicago in the United States, who was the first American import into Irish basketball. Westbrooks reunited with the Irish international basketball team of 1994 for one final game. The episode focuses on his former team captain Mark Keenan who is now a coach with top Irish side Killester, but has also developed high blood pressure.
Episode eight.
The eighth episode centred on Irish rugby out-half Tony Ward who, after thirty-five years, returns to Saint Mary's College in South Dublin. The episode focuses on Rodney O'Donnell a key member of the team who also played alongside Tony at the highest levels of international rugby. He sustained a neck injury at the age of twenty-two ending his rugby career and meaning he has not trained since.
Reaction.
John Boland of the "Irish Independent" disapproved of the focussing on unknown individuals with health issues, suggesting that the first episode be called "What Will We Do About Kevin?" because "it spent most of its length worrying about a former Manortown player of that name who was overweight and had high blood pressure".

Tabernaemontana undulata

Becchete or Bëcchëte (pronounced B'-chéw-teh) is a Matis and Matsés word for a medicinal plant now known to be Tabernaemontana undulata, a "milkwood" species in the family Apocynaceae. It occurs in the Amazon rainforest.
Effects.
When applied directly to the eye, Becchete has the effect of giving the environment greater texture and dimension, making it easier to spot animals during hunting.
The effects are reported to be long-term, lasting days or weeks, not just a few hours. In addition to visual enhancement, there is also an increase in energy. On application, the eyes sting, however this would be expected considering that Becchete is extracted with Amazonian river water that is high in tannic acid, which on its own would sting and burn the eyes. In the "Amazonian Ethnobotanical Dictionary" by James A. Duke and Rodolfo Vásquez, it is reported that Amazonian Indians from the Ticuna tribe mix the latex from a closely related species, "Tabernaemontana sananho", with water in order to treat eye wounds. In addition to be applied to the eyes as the Matis and Ticuna tribes do, it is most commonly taken orally by the Matsés.
Active ingredients.
One of the substances present in "Tabernaemontana undulata" is ibogaine, a naturally occurring psychoactive compound. Ibogaine is used in pain management and to treat opiate addiction. In addition, it is used to facilitate psychological introspection and spiritual exploration. In low dosages, ibogaine is a stimulant and aphrodisiac, while in larger amounts it is a divinatory medicine, similar to both Ayahuasca and Peyote.
History.
Scott Wallace of "National Geographic" was the first person to report the use of this indigenous Amazonian medicine by the Matis tribe.
Dan James Pantone, one of the founders of the Movement in the Amazon for Tribal Subsistence and Economic Sustainability (MATSES), discovered that the Matsés tribe also uses Becchete. In September 2008, Pantone collected plant samples from the Amazon rainforest in the Matsés Indian Territory in the region of the Yaquerana River on the border of Peru with Brazil. Working together with other botanists at the Universidad Nacional de la Amazonía Peruana (UNAP) in Iquitos, Peru, he was able to identify the plant species as "Tabernaemontana undulata", part of the "Tabernaemontana" genus and the Apocynaceae plant family. Pantone has produced a documentary video showing the Matis using Becchete as a traditional medicine.

James Cavanagh (soldier)

James Cavanagh (1831 – 7 January 1901) was an Irish-American soldier. He was the first general officer in the New York Guard.
Biography.
Cavanagh was born in County Tipperary, Ireland and emigrated to New York when he was sixteen years old and went to work as a carpenter. In 1852 he enlisted as a private in the Sixty-Ninth Regiment of the Militia, and was captain of Company C of the state command when it went to take part in the American Civil War, April 23, 1861. 
When the regiment returned after the First Battle of Bull Run and was reorganized as the Sixty-Ninth New York Volunteers of the Irish Brigade, he again went to the front as its major. In this rank he served during the campaigns of the Army of the Potomac, until the battle of Fredericksburg, 13 December 1862, when he was shot in the hip while leading the regiment in one of the charges up Marye's Heights. He was then discharged from the army because of the disabilities from his wound. 
When the State Militia was reorganized as the National Guard, he rejoined the regiment and was made its lieutenant-colonel. In 1867 he was elected colonel, which command he held for more than twenty years. He received the brevet of brigadier-general, 10 January 1893, the first time that rank was conferred on an officer of the New York State Militia, and in 1894 he retired, after a service of forty-two years. For a number of years before his death he was attached to the New York Custom House as a special customs inspector.

Murder of Fernando Martí

Fernando Martí Haik (c. 1994–2008) was the 14-year-old son of a wealthy sporting goods chain owner Alejandro Marti, whose kidnapping and murder caused a national outrage in Mexico, with some hoping that involvement of such a wealthy family might help draw attention to the issue. The murder was noticeable for its implication of mid-level law enforcement officials in Mexico City.
Kidnap and murder.
Martí was driven in an armored BMW with a bodyguard to the British American School on June 4, 2008, when he was stopped at a roadblock by officers wearing uniforms of Mexico's Federal Investigations Agency, the equivalent of the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation. The driver was tortured by having his teeth pulled out and later killed, and the bodyguard was choked. The bodyguard survived and later implicated law enforcement, including Jose Luis Romero, commander of the detective unit at Mexico City International Airport. On July 12, 2008, the ransom of 5,135,000 pesos (about US$404.3K) was agreed, but initially the official information was that a total of US$6 million was paid by all the Marti family. After several days of waiting on August 1, 2008, the body of Fernando Marti was found inside the trunk of a car that was left abandoned in the city. The case prompted public outrage in Mexico, and there has growing pressure to reintroduce capital punishment.
Criminal Investigation.
On June 17, 2009, the Subprocuraduría de Investigación Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), which specializes on criminal organized gangs, initiated an investigation for organized delinquency and kidnapping against the organization of La Flor (The Flower), thought to be responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Fernando Marti Haik.
On October 18, 2010, Alejandro Marti, now president of Mexico SOS, published photos of the alleged criminals. By the time he did so, the "Procuraduria General de la Republica" PGR announced that $15,000,000 (about US$1,181,000) would be paid as a reward anyone who could provide reliable and useful information that contributes to the location, arrest or detention of these criminals.

Biography.
He began his studies with Franz Nikolaus Jung in Worms. When he was 17 years old he started to work as litograph. His first important work was a panorama over the Rhine from Mainz to Cologne. Between 1833 and 1841 Becker studied at the Academy of Art in Düsseldorf, his professors were Johann Wilhelm Schirmer and Wilhelm von Schadow. In 1842 he became professor of genre painting and landscape painting at the Städel in Frankfurt.
Art.
Becker is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting.
He broke with the lofty attitude of much Biblical historical painting in the Städel creating his profane scenes. As the first professor of landscape and genre painting, he sought his subjects in the countryside and was especially interested in the social problems of the peasantry. He used much realistic detail and emotional gesture.
He was also open to French influences. In 1858 he offered to share his studio with Gustave Courbet and - despite having to endure some rudeness from the French artist - Becker accepted some of his stylistic influences.
Jakob Becker has taught successfully at the academy for thirty years. Some of his pupils were to form the Kronberg Painters' Colony one generation later.
One of his best-known works was “Praying Peasant Family.”

Microbundle

In mathematics, a microbundle is a generalization of the concept of vector bundle, introduced by the American mathematician John Milnor in 1964. It allows the creation of bundle-like objects in situations where they would not ordinarily be thought to exist. For example, the tangent bundle is defined for a smooth manifold but not a topological manifold. Use of microbundles allows the definition of a "topological" tangent bundle.
Definition.
The precise definition of a microbundle follows. Let "B" be a topological space. Then a "n"-microbundle consists of a triple (E, i, p) where "E" is a topological space (the "total space"), "i" is a map from "B" to "E" (the "zero section"), and "p" is a map from "E" to "B" ("the projection map"). Furthermore there are two conditions:
Note that the first condition suggests "i" is the zero section of a vector bundle, while the second is like the local triviality condition on a bundle. An important distinction here is that "local triviality" for microbundles only holds near a neighborhood of the zero section. "E" could look very wild away from that neighborhood. Also, the maps gluing together locally trivial patches of the microbundle may only overlap the fibers.
Results.
Two microbundles are isomorphic if they have neighborhoods of their zero sections which are homeomorphic by a map which make the necessary maps commute. Typical bundle operations such as induced bundles under pullback exist. 
A theorem of Kister and Mazur states that there is a neighborhood of the zero section which is actually a fiber bundle with fiber R"n" and structure group Homeo(R"n",0), the group of homeomorphisms of R"n" fixing the origin. This neighborhood is unique up to isotopy. Thus every microbundle can be refined to an actual fiber bundle in an essentially unique way.
For a manifold "M", a topological manifold, there is a microbundle given by the diagonal map "M" → "M" × "M" and projection to the first coordinate. Taking the fiber bundle contained in it gives the topological tangent bundle. Intuitively, this bundle is obtained by taking a system of small charts for "M", letting each chart "U" have a fiber "U" over each point in the chart, and gluing these trivial bundles together by overlapping the fibers according to the transition maps.
Microbundle theory is an integral part of the Kirby–Siebenmann work on smooth structures and PL structures on higher dimensional manifolds.

2007 Weber Cup

The 2007 Weber Cup, took place from October 19 to 21 at the Barnsley Metrodome.
With the overall score standing at 4-3 to the Americans, there was everything to play for following the previous year’s nail-biting epic which saw the destiny of the trophy decided in the final few frames of the deciding match.
The Europeans were once again skippered by Sweden’s Tomas Leandersson who had opted for a Nordic influenced line-up which includes veteran Tore Torgersen of Norway, PBA star Mika Koivuniemi (Finland) playing in his second Weber Cup and 3-time EBT champion, Paul Moor (England). The new boy on the team was two-handed Finnish star Osku Palermaa, who at the time topped the EBT rankings.
For Team USA, Weber Cup stalwart Tim Mack again captained Team USA. He was joined by another Weber Cup veteran, Bill Hoffman and two of the PBA stars who helped secure the trophy in 2006, as Chris Barnes and Tommy Jones made their second appearances in the competition. The American debutant was PBA Player of the Year Doug Kent, and PBA Denny's World Championship titlist.
2007 Teams.

2007 results.
Day 1, evening session.
Paul Moor once again opened for Team Europe, this time against Chris Barnes for Team USA. Moor and Barnes were never matched up in the 2006 tournament, and this was the first time they had gone head-to-head since Barnes beat Moor in the final of the 2006 World Tenpin Masters. Moor avenged this defeat with a comfortable 232-201 victory, to set Team Europe on their way. Barnes missed 2 single pins during the match.
<br>Match 2 saw Mika Koivuniemi up against Team USA Captain Tim Mack. Koivuniemi started with the first 7 strikes, and won 267-240, to put Team Europe 2-0 ahead.
<br>Team Europe debutant Osku Palermaa was able to stretch the lead even further, with a 237-206 win over Weber Cup veteran Bill Hoffman.
<br>Match 4 brought together Tore Torgersen and Team USA's debutant Doug Kent. The match went right to the wire, with Kent edging it 264-258 to gain Team USA's first point.
<br>Tommy Jones was then able to narrow the gap further, rolling only the 2nd ever perfect game in Weber Cup History. Jones opponent, Tomas Leandersson managed just 204, but was able to finish with 4 strikes in a row.
<br>The final match of the session was the team baker game. Historically this has been a strong game for Team USA, and they were able to level the tournament at 3-3, winning the match 234-215, snatching it at the end with Tommy Jones rolling 3 strikes in the 10th frame, taking his total to 16 strikes from a possible 16.
Day 2, afternoon session.
The afternoon session was made up of 3 doubles, 2 singles and 1 baker team match to finish. Up first for Team Europe were Paul Moor and Tore Torgersen, against Bill Hoffman and Doug Kent.

Pamantasan ng Cabuyao

The Pamantasan ng Cabuyao (or "University of Cabuyao") is a university in Cabuyao City, province of Laguna, Philippines. It was founded by the former Mayor Etok Aguillo, through the enactment of Municipal Ordinance 2003-059 approved on April 16, 2003.
Before the establishment of the Pamantasan ng Cabuyao, there was a satellite campus of the Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) at the Cabuyao National High School. The LSPU was operating through a memorandum of agreement between the LSPU president and Cabuyao municipal mayor which commenced in 1993 and ended on March 31, 2003.
History.
In late 2002, there was a strong protest against the leadership of the LSPC president from faculty members and students of LSPC. The protest was headed by Charlemagne G. Laviña and supported by Rosalia B. Pre, George Barundia, Christian Hernandez, Melissa Dimaculangan and one non-teaching staff, Bernie Deacosta and some students from LSPC - CABUYAO CAMPUS.
The protest was found by the Sangguniang Bayan of Cabuyao to be true and based on facts, with the support by almost all students, most of whom were Cabuyeños. It resulted to the issuance of the Notice of Termination to the memorandum of agreement. The administration of the mayor was left with no option but to establish Cabuyao Community College.
Having anticipated the closure of LSPC-Cabuyao, faculty members headed by Charlemagne Lavina and Frank Parao assisted the office of the mayor and informed them that the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM) is the model school for local college. Dr. Benjamin Tayabas, then PLM president, assisted Cabuyao municipality and personally attended to the work of putting up a university. He suggested that Pamantasan ng Cabuyao should be the name. On April 15, 2003 the Sanguniang Bayan enacted Municipal Ordinance No. 2003-059. The same was approved a day after by Mayor Proceso D. Aguillo.
Pamantasan ng Cabuyao was inaugurated on July 31, 2003, the birthday of its founding mayor, and it was personally inaugurated by no less than President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on June 19, 2003 on the occasion of the 107th birthday of Dr. Jose Rizal.
Today, under the new leadership of Hon. Isidro L. Hemedes, Jr. (the incumbent mayor) and the able assistance of Atty. Mel Gecolea (the chairperson of the Committee on Education), education reforms have been introduced, new and better systems have been put in place, and old practices have been put into sound and solid written policies and procedures.

No Laughing Matter (book)

No Laughing Matter is a 1986 book co-authored by Joseph Heller and Speed Vogel.
History.
On Sunday, December 13, 1981, Heller was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a debilitating syndrome that was to leave him temporarily paralyzed. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Mount Sinai Medical Hospital the same day , and remained there, bedridden, until his condition had improved enough to permit his transfer to the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, which occurred on January 26, 1982 .
The book reveals the assistance and companionship Heller received during this period from a laundry list of his prominent friends—Mel Brooks, Mario Puzo, Dustin Hoffman and George Mandel among them.
Heller eventually made a substantial recovery. In 1984, he divorced his wife of 35 years, Shirley, to marry Valerie Humphries, the nurse who had helped him to recover.
Speed Vogel writes of helping Heller, his friend for twenty years, through his rehabilitation. The pair write alternating chapters, which amusingly chronicle Vogel's rise through society as he stands in for Heller, even traveling to the Cannes Film Festival, while at the same time Heller is becoming more helpless.
Although Heller's disease is debilitating, the book is full of humor and never self-pitying. Heller's only lament is letting an insurance policy lapse, resulting in his out-of-pocket expenses of $120,000 in medical costs.

Kalahumoku I

Kalahumoku I or Kalahuimoku I became a ruling chief of Hana in the late 13th century. He was district king or chief of the District of Hana which was pretty much independent and balanced their power by recognizing both the Kings of Maui and the Kings of Hawaii. He was of the Pili line of Hawaii chiefs on his paternal lineage, and on his maternal lineage, he was the descendant of Kamauaua of Molokai. 
Biography.
He was born either of Molokai or the Big Island to Kanipahu, King of Hawaii and Hualani, Hereditary High Chiefess of Molokai. His brother was Kanaloa, father of King Kalapana. 
David Malo said Kalapana was his brother but this was not true because Malo had ignored a generation. His mother was great-granddaughter of Nuakea, who was the granddaughter of Maweke and wife of Keoloewaakamauaua. The two brothers had been brought up in retirement in the countryside of the Big Island, without the knowledge of Kamaiole, their father's usurper, because if Kamaiole had known them to be the sons of the king, he would have put them to death.
Sometime after or before his nephew, Kalapana, came to the Big Island throne, he settled at Kauwiki on Maui and became a ruling chieftain of Hana. He married Laamea and begot a son, Iki-a-Laamea. Iki-a-Laamea married Kalamea and begot a son, Kamanawa-a-Kalamea. Kamanawa-a-Kalamea married Kaina (Kaiua) and begot Onakaina (Ua'kaiua). Onakaia married Kuamakani and had Kanahae-a-Kuamakani who married Kapiko and had Kuleana-a-Kapiko. Kuleana-a-Kapiko married Keniani-a-hoolei and had Akahiakuleana, mother of Umi of Hawaii.

Vivid Imaginations

Vivid Imaginations is a company based in Guildford, Surrey, that manufactures, designs and distributes toys and holds distribution rights on a number of popular TV shows and Blockbuster movies. "Captain Scarlet" was the first of many distribution deals that turned Vivid into the Uk's number 1 toy and game manufacturer. Over the years Vivid has had notable success such as TV favorites "Thunderbirds" and "The Simpsons" along with Movie favorites "Cars" and "Cars 2", "Shrek", "Toy Story 3" and "Happy Feet 2", among others. Away from the silver and big screens Vivid has also has success along the way with lines such as WWE, Disney, and Bratz, as well as in house developed Animagic. 
Vivid Recently stepped back into the music scene, after a successful Take That Doll range a number of years ago, with boy bands JLS, The Wanted, X Factor's One Direction and Justin Bieber, all being immortalized in a range of dolls. Vivid's portfolio has grown steadily and includes some highly successful lines including Crayola and Moshi Monsters.
History.
The beginning.
Vivid Imaginations was founded in 1992 by former Matchbox Toys UK Managing Director Nick Austin and Finance Director Alan Bennie, with a loan of £380,000 from friends. The annual company turnover was £9.8 m in its first year and increased to over £20 m in 1996. The increase was partly due to acquiring the rights to distribute Disney and "The Simpsons" products in 1996 and distributing the Toy of the Year, the Pogmaker. Jordan Group, a private equity company from New York, bought an 80% stake in Vivid in 1998 for £25 m. In 1999, Vivid started distributing Sindy and obtained the rights to Playmates and Toy Biz products.
The 2000s.
Vivid became the third-largest advertiser in the United Kingdom and the number three toy company in 2000. In 2003, Vivid Imaginations was bought by Phoenix Equity Partners, its management and venture capital company, for £62 million.
Vivid Imaginations acquired licensing rights to Bratz in 2004. Vivid had a strong market share in the boys' toy sector and saw Bratz as the opportunity to boost its girls' range, which included Care Bears, Disney Princess and Sindy, to rival Barbie owner Mattel. Bratz was the most popular doll in the UK in 2005, and was responsible for 30% of Vivid's turnover. Sales of Bratz and "Spider-Man"-themed products made Vivid the number one toy company in the UK in 2005, the first British company to achieve this in 30 years. Bratz owner MGA Entertainment set up its own UK office in 2008 and ended the distribution deal with Vivid.
The Paris-based Vivid Europe subsidiary was formed in 2008 with the acquisition of Nomad Company, the distributor of Crayola across Europe (except Italy), the Middle East and Africa.
The 2010s.
The toys will initially focus on the six monster characters, Poppet, Katsuma, Diavlo, Zommer, Furi and Luvli as well as the 48 collectable "Moshlings" pet monsters. More toys are planned for autumn/winter with an interactive plush, playset, game and further collectables.

Henry Cole (priest)

Henry Cole (b. ca. 1500, Godshill, Isle of Wight

Life.
He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, was admitted a perpetual fellow there (1523), and received the degree of B.C.L. (1525). He then went to Italy for seven years, residing chiefly at Padua. 
During his career he was successively prebendary of Yatminster (1539); rector of Chelmsford (1540); prebendary of Holborn, Sweting (1541) and Wenlakesbarn (1542); warden of New College (1542–51), and rector of Newton Longueville in Buckinghamshire. Created a D.C.L. at Oxford (1540), he resigned his fellowship the same year. At first he conformed to Anglicanism, but afterwards returned to Catholicism about 1547, and eventually resigned all his preferments. 
In Mary I of England's reign he became Archdeacon of Ely, a canon of Westminster (1554), vicar-general of Cardinal Pole (1557), and a judge of the archiepiscopal Court of Audience. He was one of the commissioners who restored Cuthbert Tunstall and Edmund Bonner to their bishoprics, and a disputant against Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, and Hugh Latimer at Oxford (1554). He preached the sermon on the occasion of Cranmer's burning in 1556, where he had ""the job of explaining why a repentant sinner should still be burnt at the stake for heresy"".
On 13 July 1554, Cole was appointed as Archdeacon of Ely and Provost of Eton College, a post which he had vacated by 5 July 1559. He was made dean of St. Paul's in 1556, judge of Prerogative Court circa 1548-58 and dean of the arches in 1557/8. 
He was a delegate for the visitation of Oxford (1556), and Visitor of All Souls College in 1558, in which year he received the rectory of Wrotham, and was sent to Ireland with a commission for the suppression of heresy there. Cardinal Pole appointed Cole one of his executors. 
During Elizabeth's reign he remained true to the Catholic faith and took part in the discussions begun at Westminster in 1559. He was fined 500 marks, then deprived of all his preferments, committed to the Tower of London (20 May 1560), and finally removed to the Fleet prison (10 June), where he remained for nearly twenty years, until his death.

6mm Musgrave

The 6mm Musgrave was the brain child of Ben Musgrave and introduced by Musgrave Rifles in 1955 and can be described as a classic Africa cartridge. It is based on necking down the .303 British with the original intent of it being a Springbok calibre for hunting on open plains in South Africa's Karoo, Kalahari and Namakwaland. It is also well suited for other smaller antelope where longer shots have to be taken. Although not designed for bushveld conditions, the calibre can be downloaded to drive 100 grainers at 2500 feet per second and makes a very good cartridge for Impala and Reedbuck.
Like the .243 Winchester it has a fast rifle twist of 1-10 inches, however if 105 grain bullets are used it is recommended that a 1-9 or even faster twist is used to stabilise the bullets.
PMP (Pretoria Metal Pressings) is one of the very few ammunition manufacturers of 6mm Musgrave ammunition, but a lot of South African distributors have the ammunition in stock. A lot of international manufacturers (like Hornady, Nosler, Barnes, etc.) manufacture 6mm bullets for handloading.

Single-gender world

A relatively common motif in speculative fiction is the existence of single gender worlds or single-sex societies. These fictional societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences in science fiction and fantasy. In the fictional setting, these societies often arise due to elimination of one gender through war or natural disasters and disease. The societies may be portrayed as utopian – particularly in feminist texts – or dystopian, as seen in pulp tales of oppressive matriarchies.
Female-only worlds.
There is a long tradition of female-only places in literature and mythology, starting with the Amazons and continuing into some examples of feminist utopias. In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about, among other approaches, by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female parthenogenic reproduction. The resulting society is often shown to be utopian by feminist writers. Several influential feminist utopias of this sort were written in the 1970s; the most often studied examples include Joanna Russ's "The Female Man", Suzy McKee Charnas's "Walk to the End of the World" and "Motherlines", and Marge Piercy's "Woman on the Edge of Time". Utopias imagined by male authors have generally included equality between sexes, rather than separation. Female-only societies may be seen as an extreme type of a biased sex-ratio, another common SF theme.
Such worlds have been portrayed most often by lesbian or feminist authors; their use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from patriarchy. The societies may not necessarily be lesbian, or sexual at all—a famous early sexless example being "Herland" (1915) by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.
Some lesbian separatist authors have used female-only societies to additionally posit that all women would be lesbians if having no possibility of sexual interaction with men, as in "Ammonite" (1993) by Nicola Griffith. The enormously influential "The Female Man" (1975) and "When It Changed" (1972) by Joanna Russ portrayed a peaceful agrarian society of lesbians who resent the later intrusion of men, and a world in which women plan a genocidal war against men, implying that the utopian lesbian society is the result of this war.
During the pulp era, matriarchal dystopias were relatively common, in which female-only or female-controlled societies were shown unfavourably. In John Wyndham's "Consider Her Ways" (1956), male rule is shown as being repressive of women, but freedom from patriarchy is only possible in an authoritarian caste-based female-only society. Poul Anderson's "Virgin Planet" depicted a world where five castaway women found a way of reproducing asexually—but the daughter is an exact copy of the mother, with the result that eventually the planet has a large population composed entirely of "copies" of the original five. Among them, males are considered mythical creatures—and a man who lands on the planet after centuries of isolation finds it difficult to prove that he is one.
James Tiptree Jr., a woman writing secretly under a male pseudonym, explored the sexual impulse and gender as two of her main themes; in her award-winning "Houston, Houston, Do You Read?" (collected in "Her Smoke Rose Up Forever"), she presents a female-only society after the extinction of men from disease. The society lacks stereotypically "male" problems such as war and crime, but is stagnant. The women reproduce via cloning and consider men to be comical.
Male-only worlds.
Men-only societies are much less common than women-only societies. Joanna Russ suggests this is because men do not feel oppressed, and therefore imagining a world free of women does not imply an increase in freedom and is not as attractive.
Some examples include:
"Ethan of Athos" by Lois Bujold, inspired by the real world male-only religious society of Mount Athos, shows a world in which men have isolated their planet from the rest of civilisation to avoid the "corrupting" effect of women. Children are grown in uterine replicators, using ova derived from tissue cultures; the novel's plot is driven by the declining fertility of these cultures.
A. Bertram Chandler's "A Spartan Planet" features the men-only planet Sparta which is dedicated to the values of militarism loosely modeled upon the ancient Greek city state of Sparta [http://www.amazon.com/Spartan-planet-Dell-Bertram-Chandler/dp/B000GZL9B8].
Cordwainer Smith's short story "The Crime and the Glory of Commander Suzdal" portrays a society in which all of the women have died out.
Genderless or hermaphroditic worlds.
Some other fictional worlds feature societies in which everyone has more than one gender, or none, or can change gender. For example:
Ursula K. Le Guin's "The Left Hand of Darkness" (1969) depicts a world in which individuals are neither "male" nor "female" but can have both male and female sexual organs and reproductive abilities, making them in some senses intersexual. Similar patterns exist in Greg Egan's novel "Schild's Ladder" and his novella "Oceanic" or in Storm Constantine's book series "Wraeththu" about an oogamous magical race that arose from mutant human beings.
John Varley, who also came to prominence in the 1970s, also often writes on gender-related themes. In his "Eight Worlds" suite of stories (many collected in "The John Varley Reader") and novels, for example, humanity has achieved the ability to change sex at a whim. Homophobia is shown to initially inhibit uptake of this technology, as it engenders drastic changes in relationships, with homosexual sex becoming an acceptable option for all.
In the Culture series of novels and stories by Iain M. Banks, humans can and do relatively easily (and reversibly) change sex.
Gender segregation.
Segregation of genders is another relatively common trope of speculative fiction—physical separation can result in societies that are essentially single-gender, although the majority of such works focus on the reunification of the genders, or otherwise on links that remain between them, as with Sheri S. Tepper's "The Gate to Women's Country", David Brin's "Glory Season" and Carol Emshwiller's "Boys". Even an episode of Duckman tried this.
Sometimes the segregation is social, and men and women interact to a limited extent. For example, when overpopulation drives the world away from heterosexuality in Charles Beaumont's short story "The Crooked Man" (1955), first published in "Playboy", homosexuals oppress the heterosexual minority and relationships between men and women are made unlawful.

Demountable copy

Demountable copy is a term describing the method of manufacture of some signs in the United States. Demountable copy signage is built by attaching mass-produced sheet-metal characters (and graphics, such as route shields and arrows) to the sign face, through means such as screws or rivets. 
Because of the ability to remove the preformed metal characters from the sign, demountable-copy signs can be easily altered to change their message by removing unwanted sections of the legend and installing new elements. However, newly manufactured characters must be stored until their use, which could potentially take up much more space than the rolls of retroreflective sheeting required for direct-applied copy.
The Kansas Department of Transportation uses demountable copy extensively on its freeway signage.

Economy of Andhra Pradesh

The economy of Andhra Pradesh is mainly driven by agriculture. Two important rivers of India, the Godavari and Krishna, flow through the state, providing irrigation. Rice, sugarcane, cotton, mirchi (chilli pepper), mango and tobacco are the local crops. Recently, crops used for vegetable oil production such as sunflower and peanuts have gained favour. There are many multi-state irrigation projects in development, including Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects and Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, the world's highest masonry dam.
The state has also started to focus on the fields of information technology and biotechnology. In 2004–2005, Andhra Pradesh was in fourth position behind Maharastra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, in the list of top IT exporting states of India. The IT exports from the State were 180 crore in 2004. The IT sector is expanding at a rate of 52.3% every year. The IT exports reached 1900 crore in 2006–2007 and ranked fourth in India. The service sector of the state already accounts for 43% of the GSDP and employs 20% of the work force.

IT exports alone from Andhra Pradesh for 2007–08 is Rs.26,122-crore mark, up from Rs.18,500 crore recorded last fiscal, according to Hyderabad Software Exporters Association (HYSEA).
Agriculture.
Agriculture is the main occupation and 60 percent of population is engaged in agriculture and related activities. Rice is the major food crop and staple food of the state. Other important crops are Jowar, Bajra, Maize, ragi, small millets, pulses, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane. The state has 23 percent area covered with forest.Agriculture has been the chief source of income for the state's economy. Four important rivers of India, the Godavari, Krishna, Penna, and Tungabhadra flow through the state, providing irrigation. Rice, sugarcane, cotton, Chili pepper, mango, and tobacco are the local crops. Recently, crops used for vegetable oil production such as sunflower and peanuts have gained favour. There are many multi-state irrigation projects in development, including Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects and Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, the world's highest masonry dam.
Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the economy of Andhra Pradesh and the better performance of this sector is vital for inclusive growth. Although its contribution to gross state domestic product (GSDP) is around one-fourth, agriculture provides employment to nearly 60 per cent of the work force. Andhra Pradesh was among the very few states in the country which went in for the Green Revolution in rice cultivation in the 1970s. The share of agriculture in GSDP and employment are higher in A.P. as compared to
all-India. The per capita value of GSDP from agriculture is relatively higher in the state when compared to all- India. Average per capita agricultural income in the state was Rs.3618 while it was Rs.3360 in all-India at constant (1993–94) prices in the triennium 2002–05. There have been significant changes in the structure and performance of the agrarian economy in the state. In recent years, the state has also been facing a crisis in agriculture with a high incidence of suicides by farmers.
Land reforms.
Land reforms, in spite of all the limitations in implementation, did play an important role in changing the agrarian structure in Andhra Pradesh. The early land reform measures in the state were a combination of two administrative histories, of the Andhra region and the Telangana region which had formerly been under the Nizam. Following the pattern at the all-India level, the land reforms in Andhra Pradesh had three components: abolition of intermediaries, tenancy reforms, ceiling legislation and the other government initiatives.In 1977, the government of Andhra Pradesh enacted the Assigned Land Prohibition Act which ruled that land that had been 'assigned' by the government to the landless and tribals could not be resold and used for purposes other than agriculture3 . To improve women's access to land and landed property Andhra Pradesh along with Karnataka and Tamil Nadu amended the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, to legally protect the right of women to property including land.
With respect to tenancy, the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act was enacted in 1950 which gave protection to nearly six lakh tenants who held over of land, constituting 33 per cent of the total cultivated area. This was considered one of the progressive acts of legislation in the state. The AP (Andhra Area) Tenancy Act 1956 was passed to ensure that a tenant was not evicted from his/her holding except by going to court. This legislation has given a mixed result as it often led to concealed tenancy (Reddy, 2006). Legislation on ceilings on agricultural holdings was enacted in two phases, 1955–72 and 1972 to the present.
The Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agriculture Holdings) Acts were passed in 1961 and 1973. As in most states, the first round of legislation in 1961 was a miserable failure but the second one in 1973 had some impact. Against an estimated surplus land of , only were declared surplus, of which were taken possession by the government and were distributed among 479,000 beneficiaries till August 2004 (GOAP, 2004). This amounted to about 4 per cent of the net sown area.
Industries.
Several major industries are in operation around Hyderabad, which has now been nicknamed as Cyberabad due to its Information Technology foray and location of major software industries in the city. Another industrial location is Visakhapatnam which is also one of the major sea ports of India. The State is promoting Information Technology in a big way and has one of the IT parks in Hyderabad.
Active industries.
Automobiles and Auto components Industry,spices,mines and minerals,Texttiles and apparels,IT industry,Bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals, horticulture,poultry farming are the main industries in Andhra Pradesh.
Resources.
Andhra Pradesh has the largest deposits of quality Chrysotile Asbestos in India. It accounts for about 93 percent of India's total production of Barites. Other important minerals in the state are copper ore, manganese, mica, coal and limestone.
Tourism.
Charminar, Salarjung Museum, Golconda Fort, Tirupathi, Warangal fort are some of the important tourism locations.Tirupathi is one of the major source of income in the tourism segment because of the abode of Sri Venkateswara (Lord Balaji). The temple is one of the richest in the world in terms of donations received. Other important sources of income come from the developing tourism centres at Vishakapatnam, Vijayawada.
GSDP.
The GSDP at current prices(1999–2000) for the year 2009–10 is estimated at Rs.3,64,341 crore as against Rs.3,38,907 crore for 2008–09 reflecting a growth of 7.5%. During last FiveYears, the GSDP of A.P on the average recorded 9.14%, and higher than the Annual Average Growth of GDP (All India) which is 8.49% only. Further,during last three years, the GSDP of AP was consistently more than 10%,which itself is a record. With more than 10% Growth for the past 3 years and due to this high Base effect, further Growth Rate in during 2008–09 is only 5.53%. In spite of Global recession and negative growth trends in the major world economies, the State is able to continue the growth path along with the Nation.
Growth of different sectors 2008–2009.
The sectoral composition of GSDP growth for 2008–09 in Service sector with 10.06% has maintained the same growth tempo, while the Agriculture sector with 2.27% and industry sector with 0.12% have recorded little lesser growthrate. At All India level (GDP), the Sectoral Growth rate in Service sector is 9.67%, while in Agriculture Sector, it is 1.60%. In these both sectors, our State's Growth rate is higher than All India level. The relative decline in agriculture growth during 2008–09 is due to a very high base effect during the previous years especially last year i.e. 14.85%. However, the foodgrain production has reached a peak of 20,404,000 tones during the year 2008–09.
Per capita income.
The per capita income figure gives a better idea of the standard of living of the people. The Per Capita Income of Andhra Pradesh at current prices is estimated at Rs.39,597 in 2008–09 as against Rs.35,864 in 2007–2008.
Public finance.
The finances of Government of Andhra Pradesh are robust due to efficient public finance management. The State is well in advance in eliminating revenue deficit and achieving other fiscal targets enacted in APFRBM Act, 2005. The State revenue receipts stood at Rs.696.85 million in 2008–09 (RE) of which the State's own revenue is Rs.44,138 crore. The revenue receipts under State's own taxes during the year 2008–09 (RE) stood at Rs.35,739 crore as against Rs.28,794 crore in the previous year
registering a growth rate of 24.12%. Total expenditure (revenue + capital) stood at Rs.85,363 crore for the year 2008–09 (RE). The capital expenditure constituted 20.78% of the total expenditure (revenue + capital). Revenue Surplus for 2008–09 (RE) is Rs.2,066 crore. The Fiscal Deficit is Rs.10,427 crore which 2.81% of GSDP./
Economic timeline.
Economic changes during 1954–1983.
This can be called the 29-year era of 12 centrally nominated chief ministers List of Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh. Excluding Kasu Brahmananda Reddy term (7 years), average tenure of a chief minister was less than two years. The cumulative growth during this 30-year period for Indian economy is 311%, and for Andhra Pradesh it was 138%.
Economic changes during the 1980s.
This can be called the N. T. Rama Rao Era (1983–1989).An academic study of Andhra's economic activity using official data collected by the state government of Andhra Pradesh, Govt of India and World Bank reveal the following highlights.
Economic changes during the 1995s.

Castle Farms

Castle Farms is one of Michigan's largest special events facilities, and it is located in Charlevoix, Michigan. It was constructed in 1918 by Albert Loeb, who was the Vice President of Sears, Roebuck and Company, and it was designed by Arthur Heun. Albert Loeb, in addition to being a wealthy businessman, was the father of murderer Richard Loeb a/k/a "Dickie", who with schoolmate Nathan "Babe" Leopold, committed the infamous Leopold and Loeb murder in Chicago.
Albert Loeb built Castle Farms as a model farm to showcase livestock in addition to new farm equipment that was sold by his company. In 1927, the farm was closed and the buildings rented for storage space until 1965. It was then turned into an art studio by John Van Haver. In 1969, it was sold to Arthur and Erwina Reibel and was mainly used for rock concerts. Some of the more notable acts include Metallica, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, and The Beach Boys. 
In 2001, Castle Farms was sold to current owner Linda Mueller who finished restoring it to its original condition by 2005. Today, it is open year round, and is primarily used for weddings and receptions. However, Castle Farms is also used for other various festivals and social events, such as the Charlevoix Renaissance Festival. In 2008, a model railroad was added that provides a scenic journey through Charlevoix's history.

Daragang Magayon

Daragang Magayon is the heroine that appears in the legend of Mt. Mayon in Albay, Philippines. Her name means "beautiful lady" (""daraga"" - "lady or maiden"; ""magayon"" - "beautiful").
Basic legend.
Magayon grew up to be a very beautiful and sweet woman that struck the swains from faraway tribes who vied for her attention. But not one of these young men have captivated the heart of Magayon, not even the handsome but haughty Pagtuga (eruption). He is a hunter and the chief of the Iriga tribe. She was the only daughter of Makusog (strong), the tribal chief of Rawis, whose mother died shortly after giving birth to her. He gave fabulous gifts to Magayon and vied for her attention.
One day, Panganoron/Ulap (cloud), the chief of the Karilaga tribe of the Tagalog region, showed up in Rawis. Unlike the other suitors, he had come a long way just to see the beauty of Magayon. For many days, he simply stole glances of Magayon, from a distance, as she bathed at the Yawa River. After a few more meetings with Magayon, Panginoron signified his intention to marry her by thrusting his spear at the stairs of Magayon's father's house. The two were overjoyed, but the wedding will be held in a month's time, for Panginoron had yet to inform his people to gather the provisions for the celebration.
The news spread fast and reached Pagtuga, who became furious. He laid in wait for Makusog to hunt and took him and sent word to Magayon that unless she agreed to marry him, her father would die and a war would be waged against Rawis.
Panginoron abandoned the preparations for their wedding to go to Pagtuga. They fought each other until Pagtuga was slained by Panginoron. The joyous Magayon rushed to embrace Panginoron but she was hit by a stray arrow. While Panginorin held the dying Magayon in his arms, Linog (earthquake), Pagtuga's henchman, hurled his spear at Panginorin's back, killing him instantly. Makusog swung his mighty arms and stuck down Linog with his "minasbad".
Instead of rejoicing over a wedding, there was wailing over the dead. Makusog dug a grave for Magayon and Panginoron. Tenderly, Makusog laid them together on each other's arms as they died.
As the days followed, they saw the grave rising higher and higher, accompanied by muffled rumblings, earthquakes, and red-hot boulders bursting from the crater. When this occurs, old folks believe that Pagtuga, aided by Linog, agitates the volcano to get back his gifts, which following ancient custom, was buried with Magayon.
On certain days, when the tip of the volcano is covered by clouds, old folks say that Panginoron is kissing Magayon, and afterwards, when rain trickles caressingly down the gentle slopes of the volcano, with the insistence that it was the tears of Panginoron over his lost love.
They named the volcano as ""Bulkang Magayon"", describing its perfect cone-shape, like the beauty of Daragang Magayon. But as time passed, the name "'Magayon"" was shortened and it became ""Mayon"".

Ultimatum (novel)

Ultimatum is a 1974 novel by Richard Rohmer with political, economic, energy crisis themes as well as an opinion by the author of the viability of the Canadian nation.
The novel is set in the mid to late 1970s, after a change in government in Canada that has put a new man, Robert Porter, into the post of prime minister. Whether this change in government is a new leadership in the Liberal Party or a change to the Progressive Conservative Party is not indicated, but the third and fourth parties, the New Democratic Party and the Social Credit Party, are referred to by name, along with fictitious leaders for them and the opposition party.
The United States president is a Texan and his full name is never spoken. He is a qualified airliner pilot. His party affiliation is not identified as Democrat or Republican.
The United States has just endured a particularly difficult winter due to the shortage of natural gas, particularly in the northeast and the Midwest. The president is frustrated that vast reserves of natural gas have been identified in Canada's Arctic islands by American companies, but cannot be developed because Canada wants first to determine its requirements. In addition, a newly completed Mackenzie Valley pipeline is not yet operational because someone, possibly aggrieved First Nations people, are bombing it.
The president telephones the Canadian prime minister, outlines the situation, says Canada really should have imitated the Alaskan native settlement of 1971 and come to a final agreement with its own native peoples. The president gives Porter an ultimatum: it has 48 hours to give the United States carte blanche access to the natural gas found by American companies, or economic sanctions will be placed on Canada. Shortly after giving the ultimatum, the president embarks on Air Force One to inspect the natural gas developments in the islands of the high Canadian arctic. His interest is in transport of gas, particularly by aircraft or pipeline.
Prime Minister Porter quickly summons his staff and cabinet to make the initial dealings, but the armed forces are used to get all members of Parliament to Ottawa as quickly as possible. A hasty schedule is set for briefings, then a debate and decision. The prime minister also calls upon a former law partner who is a leading resident among the First Nations in the Mackenzie Delta. It turns out this individual is the one who's been setting the bombs. Porter persuades him to disarm the latest bombs so as not to antagonize the Americans, but to come to Ottawa himself. The prime minister addresses the nation and invites Canadians to call their local radio or television station to cast a yes or no vote, which will be tallied and sent to Ottawa.
Meanwhile, Air Force One, with two Canadian fighter jets as escort, has passed over Churchill, Manitoba to inspect an impressive deep sea port being built by the Canadian government, and then lands in Resolute, Northwest Territories. A smaller plane takes the president to a gas development area where two experimental undersea gas pipelines have been installed and are ready for tests. One breaks its anchors, bursts through the sea ice and the president is barely yanked from the jaws of death, but the other experimental model works, showing it will be possible to put a pipeline between islands to reach the mainland.
The president addresses his nation from aboard Air Force One, although it is supposed to look like he's in Washington, D.C., and they even use a Canadian Anik satellite to get the signal to Washington.
On the day when the ultimatum is to be answered, the members of the House of Commons and the Senate meet in the House for a briefing by key cabinet members. One issue that is addressed is for Canada to join OPEC. A decision to negotiate a final settlement with the First Nations peoples is made, as well as improved autonomy for the two northern territories. Later in the day, Parliament is convened with a very brief speech from the throne, then the motion covering a response to the ultimatum is placed for debate, is debated, and the Parliamentarians vote to reject the ultimatum and offer an alternative to the United States. The Canadians who phoned in their votes also rejected the ultimatum.
The prime minister phones an angry president to advise him; the president is ready to step up the sanctions he had begun to impose the day before, but realizes how damaging they and Canada's counter-sanctions will be to both countries. He has to resort to an alternative that will spare the two nations that damage, but it means a major change for the Canadian nation.

Molesme Abbey

Molesme Abbey was a well-known Benedictine monastery in Molesme, in Laignes, Côte-d'Or, Burgundy, on the border of the Dioceses of Langres and Troyes.
History.
Molesme Abbey was founded in 1075 by Robert, afterwards known as Robert of Molesme and Saint Robert. He had previously been abbot of the abbey of Saint-Michel, Tonnerre, which had gained a reputation for laxity in observance. He was unable to reform the monks and had returned to his previous monastery at Montier-en-Celle. At about this time he consented to repeated requests from a group of hermits to lead them in founding a new community of rigour and austerity of life. They settled in 1075 on a piece of land in the present Molesme, once the site of the Gallo-Roman settlement of Vertilium, on a hillside by the River Leignes given to Robert by Hugo de Norlennac, where they built a house and chapel from the branches of trees. Here the community lived in extreme poverty until a bishop visited them, and, seeing their need, sent them a supply of food and clothing.
News of the rigour of the new foundation and of the holiness of its members soon spread, and attracted many members of noble families, who in many cases brought with them their worldly possessions. These gifts, together with the many benefactions the new abbey received, enabled the community to build a magnificent church, as well as suitable monastic buildings.
Among the many who were inspired to join Robert at Molesme were Stephen Harding, future leader of the Cistercians, and Bruno of Cologne, future founder of the Carthusian Order.
The increase in numbers and wealth however caused a temporary loss of rigour, in that many of the new monks were not keen to work in the fields, preferring to live on the alms given them. This dissatisfaction reached the point of open rebellion and Robert therefore left Molesme in 1098, accompanied by only the most fervent religious, and this time founded Cîteaux Abbey, which although it was originally intended as a Benedictine monastery, became the first and mother-house of the Cistercian Order.
The monks of Molesme meanwhile repented of their faults, and begged Pope Urban II to oblige Robert to return to them, which he did in 1099, and continued to govern them and to make of Molesme a centre of strict Benedictine observance until his death in 1110.
Besides Cîteaux, Molesme founded seven or eight other monasteries and had about the same number of Benedictine nunneries under its jurisdiction. The monastery with its church was destroyed and its possessions confiscated in 1472 during the war between France and Burgundy. The buildings were again burned by the Huguenots towards the close of the sixteenth century in the French Wars of Religion. In the seventeenth century the spiritual life of the monastery was revived on the introduction of the reform of St. Maur in 1648. The buildings were comprehensively restored during the 18th century, but the abbey was suppressed during the French Revolution and most of the buildings, including the abbey church, were destroyed.
Present day.
The principal survival is the Church of Sainte-Croix, built in the second half of the 13th century as a chapel for the abbey's novices, which remained in use as a church after the destruction of the rest of the abbey. In the 19th century a new belltower was constructed. The building was damaged in 1940 during fighting between French and German troops in World War II, and traces of this damage are still visible.
There are also some remains of service and ancillary buildings.
The abbey site has been a listed "monument historique" since 1985. It is accessible by prior arrangement only.

Szeming Sze

Szeming Sze (Chinese: 施思明, Pinyin: Shī Sīmíng; April 5, 1908 – October 27, 1998) was a prominent Chinese diplomat and the co-founder who helped build the World Health Organization into a specialized United Nations agency.
Early life.
Dr. Sze was born in Tientsin (now Tianjin), China. He was the eldest son of Dr. Alfred Sao-ke Sze, who became his country's Ambassador to Great Britain and, later, the United States.
Dr. Sze received degrees in chemistry and medicine at Winchester College and Christ's College (1925 to 1928), Cambridge University and interned in Britain, where he was inspired by his residency at St. Thomas Hospital in a London slum to do public service, before returning to China in 1934.
Career.
Early Years.
He was in the United States when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, and he joined the Lend-Lease program for the Chinese Government. Dr. Sze attended the San Francisco Conference that gave birth to the United Nations as an official of Chinese delegation and medical expert.
Initiator of World Health Organization.
Before the San Francisco Conference on International Organization opened on April 25, 1945, the US and UK delegates had consulted each other and had agreed that no questions in the field of health would be included on the conference agenda. Dr. Szeming Sze from the Chinese delegation, Dr. de Paula Souza from the Brazilian delegation and Dr. Karl Evang from the Norwegian delegation, not knowing of the US-UK consultations, agreed that the question of establishing a new international health organization should be put on the conference agenda. Since China was one of the four sponsoring powers of the Conference, it was thought that Dr. Sze should get the Chinese delegation to initiate the proposal for a proposed amendment to the draft Charter which had been prepared at Dumbarton Oaks. Unfortunately, there was not sufficient time left for submission of an amendment. So another approach was tried in the form of a resolution for Commission II, Committee 3, of which Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar of India was the Chairman, calling for an international health conference of Member States which would have as its aim the establishment of an international health organization. The draft resolution was formally submitted as a joint proposal of the Chinese and Brazilian delegations. The resolution got bogged down in the Committee. By another twist of fate, Dr. Sze one day found himself sitting next to Mr Alger Hiss, Secretary-General of the Conference, at an official dinner. Dr. Sze asked Mr Hiss for his advice, who suggested rewriting the resolution in the form of a declaration, which would not be considered as being under the same interdiction as a resolution. This advice turned out to be very sound, and with overwhelming support the Declaration was adopted. This was the beginning of the future World Health Organization.
UN years.
Dr. Sze became chief of specialized agencies for the Eco-nomic & Social Council of the United Nations. He was greatly disappointed when he was later offered a job at WHO that he couldn't take because of his U.N. commitments.
He became U.N. medical director in 1948, taking care of the permanent staff of about 3000, including inoculating them and preparing them for missions abroad. He held the position for 20 years.
Reputation.
In 1975, Henry Van Zile Hyde, Chief of Health Division during the Truman Administration, said of Dr Sze “... was the member of the Chinese delegation. His father had been the Chinese Ambassador to England and the United States. And Szeming Sze was a very brilliant Chinese”.
In 1998, at the 51st World Health Assembly, the Norwegian Minister of Health, Mr Dagfinn Høybråten, acknowledged Dr Szeming
Sze as “one of the initiators of the WHO”. Mr Høybråten quoted Dr Sze as saying “Of course we can learn from history. We learn from the mistakes made if not from the successes. Learning the reasons why certain things happened often saves us from making the same mistakes again”.
Personal Life and Posterity.
Dr. Sze married to Bessie Li (Chinese: 李月卿), a pianist in 1934 and he is survived by a daughter, Diane Wei (Chinese: 施家莲); a son, Chia-ming Sze (Chinese: 施家铭); two sisters, Julia Sze-Bailey, and Alice Wang; five grandchildren, and fourteen great-grandchildren.<br>
His granddaughter, Sarah Sze (born 1969) won a MacArthur "genius grant" in 2003 for her work as an installation artist.
Death.
Dr. Sze died on October 27, 1998 at Presbyterian Senior Care, at Presbyterian Medical Center in suburban Pittsburgh at the age of 90.

472d Bombardment Group

The 472d Bombardment Group is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was last assigned to the Second Air Force, being stationed at Clovis Army Airfield, New Mexico. It was inactivated on 1 April 1944.
The group served as the initial Operational Training Unit (OTU) for prototype B-29 Superfortress aircraft as part of the 58th Bombardment Wing. After the wing deployed to India, it was involved in training B-29 crews in New Mexico and took part in early testing of the B-29 to carry the Atomic Bomb.
History.
On 1 June 1943, the first Superfortress unit—the 58th Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy) had been activated at Dobbins AFB, Marietta, Georgia near Bell's Superfortress plant. On 15 September 1943, the headquarters of the 58th BW was moved to Smokey Hill AAF Kansas, with some of its groups near the Wichita factory. The 472nd Bombardment Group was constituted on 19 May 1943 at Smokey Hill AAF to be the initial group to receive the prototype YB-29 and first production B-29 Superfortresses. There were five groups in the 58th Bomb Wing, but the 472d was destined to remain at Smoky Hill Field as an operational training unit, and the others were to be deployed to India.
President Roosevelt wanted the B-29 bombing raids against Japan to start by January 1944. However, delays in the B-29 program forced General Arnold to admit to the President that the bombing campaign against Japan could not begin until May 1944 at the earliest. The crews of the B-29 needed a degree of specialist training that was not required for crews of other, less complex aircraft. It usually took 27 weeks to train a pilot, 15 to train a navigator, and 12 to train a gunner. The complexity of the B-29 was such that a lengthy process of crew integration had to take place before combat deployment could begin. By the end of December 1943, only 73 pilots had qualified for the B-29 and very few crews had been brought together as a complete team.
After the initial groups of the 58th Bomb Wing completed conversion training on the B-29, the 472d was moved to Clovis AAF, New Mexico in December 1943 to begin training follow-on B-29 crews. However the group also was involved in secret testing of the B-29 for suitability in carrying Atomic Bombs, which were being developed at Los Alamos, New Mexico.
In September 1943, the B-29 was selected as the carrier for the Atomic Bomb. At first, the team responsible for the adaptation of the B-29 to the atomic bomb would only be provided with rough dimensions of the bomb, since even the scientists were not yet sure what it would look like. The technicians fitted a new H-frame hoist, carrier assembly and release unit to the B-29. The first drop tests using dummy bombs were carried out at Muroc AAF, California on 28 February 1944. These lead to the fitting of an entirely new suspension mechanism to the B-29.
With these initial tests completed, and the B-29 crew training program well underway, the group was inactivated on 1 April 1944.

Example of a game without a value

In game theory, and in particular the study of zero-sum continuous games, it is commonly assumed that a game has a minimax value. This is the expected value to one of the players when both play a perfect strategy (which is to choose from a particular PDF).
This article gives an example of a zero sum game that has no value. It is due to Sion and Wolfe. 
Zero sum games with a finite number of pure strategies are known to have a minimax value (originally proved by John von Neumann) but this is not necessarily the case if the game has an infinite set of strategies. There follows a simple example of a game with no minimax value.
The existence of such zero-sum games is interesting because many of the results of game theory become inapplicable if there is no minimax value.
The game.
Players I and II each choose a number, formula_1 and formula_2 respectively, with formula_3; the payoff to I is
(i.e. player II pays formula_5 to player I;the game is zero-sum). Sometimes player I is referred to as the "maximizing player" and player II the "minimizing player".
If formula_6 is interpreted as a point on the unit square, the figure shows the payoff to player I. Now suppose that player I adopts a mixed strategy: choosing a number from probability density function (pdf) formula_7; player II chooses from formula_8. Player I seeks to maximize the payoff, player II to minimize the payoff. Note that each player is aware of the other's objective.
Game value.
Sion and Wolfe show that 
but
These are the maximal and minimal expectations of the game's value of player I and II respectively.
The formula_11 and formula_12 respectively take the supremum and infimum over pdf's on the unit interval (actually Borel probability measures). These represent player I and player II's (mixed) strategies. Thus, player I can assure himself of a payoff of at least 3/7 if he knows player II's strategy; and player II can hold the payoff down to 1/3 if he knows player I's strategy.
There is clearly no epsilon equilibrium for sufficiently small formula_13, specifically, if formula_14. Dasgupta and Maskin assert that the game values are achieved if player I puts probability weight only on the set formula_15 and player II puts weight only on formula_16.
Glicksberg's theorem shows that any zero-sum game with upper or lower semicontinuous payoff function has a value (in this context, an upper (lower) semicontinuous function "K" is one in which the set formula_17 (resp formula_18) is open for any real "c").
Observe that the payoff function of Sion and Wolfe's example is clearly not semicontinuous. However, it may be made so by changing the value of "K"("x", "x") and "K"("x", "x" + 1/2) the payoff along the two discontinuities to either +1 or −1, making the payoff upper or lower semicontinuous respectively. If this is done, the game then has a value.
Generalizations.
Subsequent work by Heuer discusses a class of games in which the unit square is divided into three regions, the payoff function being constant in each of the regions.

Pao Ming Pu

Pao Ming Pu (the form of his name he used in Western languages, although the Wade-Giles transliteration would be Pu Baoming; ; August 1910 – February 22, 1988), was a mathematician born in Jintang County, Sichuan, China. 
He was a student of Charles Loewner and a pioneer of systolic geometry, having proved what is today called Pu's inequality for the real projective plane, following Loewner's proof of Loewner's torus inequality. He later worked in the area of fuzzy mathematics. He spent much of his career as professor and chairman of the department of mathematics at Sichuan University.
Biography.
Pu received his Ph.D. at Syracuse University in 1950 under the supervision of Charles Loewner, resulting in the publication in 1952 of the seminal paper
containing both Pu's inequality for the real projective plane and Loewner's torus inequality.
The listing at the Mathematics Genealogy Project indicates that his first name, according to Syracuse University records, was "Frank".
Pu returned to mainland China in February 1951. (Katz '07) suggests that Pu may have been forced to return to the mainland by the communist authorities, as there was apparently a wave of recalls of Chinese academics working in the West following Chiang Kai-shek's ouster from the mainland in 1949.
After his return, Pu became a professor at Sichuan University in 1952. He served as head of the department of mathematics from 1952 to 1984. While he was apparently unable to supervise graduate students during most of his scientific career, he became one of the first group of supervisors for graduate students (bóshìshēng dǎoshī, ) at the age of 71, four years after the end of the Cultural Revolution.
Most of his later papers concern fuzzy topology.
Influence.
According to Google Scholar,
Pu's seminal article from 1952 is cited by at least 93 mathematical works, a high score by mathematical standards. His joint work with Liu in fuzzy topology

continues to be cited frequently in current literature in fuzzy mathematics.

World Travel Monitor

The "World Travel Monitor® (WTM®) / European Travel Monitor® (ETM®)" is a worldwide tourism information system detailing the foreign (outbound) travel behavior practiced by a country’s respective resident population.
Origins / Objective.
The "European Travel Monitor®" has been continuously surveying the most important data on outbound travel behavior from all European countries since 1988. In 1995, the "European Travel Monitor®" was expanded to the "World Travel Monitor®" to cover all the important overseas markets (USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Japan, China, India, etc.). Data is collected by the architects of the Monitor or by means of working cooperations in the various countries. Today (2013), the "World Travel Monitor®" chronicles about 90% of all international travel flows. Conceived and realized by IPK International, the surveys have the objective of tracking all outbound travel of at least one overnight stay, regardless of travel motive. Apart from holiday trips, business trips and all other private trips (e.g. visiting friends or relatives) are also recorded.
The driving impetus behind establishing this information system – initially for Germany ("German Travel Monitor®") and Europe – was the fact that it was not possible for decision-makers in the tourism field, based on the information available to them up to that point in time, to gain an overview of the European market or any overseas markets (in the form of a database enabling a direct comparison of aspects such as the volume and structure of outbound trips taken by the Germans, Americans, British, Russians, Chinese, etc.). While various surveys and official statistics were available prior to the introduction of the "World Travel Monitor® / European Travel Monitor®", the individual datasets were virtually impossible to compare because there were major dissimilarities among the samplings as well as among the survey methods used in the individual countries.
The "World Travel Monitor® / European Travel Monitor®" are cooperative partnership studies. Main contracting entities include national and regional tourist boards, tourism and economics ministries, tour operators, international hotel chains, advertising agencies, consulting firms, etc.
Methodology.
The "World Travel Monitor® / European Travel Monitor®" are population-representative surveys; i.e., the composition of the sample corresponds to the composition of the population in the respective countries (over the age of 15). Study respondents are surveyed by computer-supported telephone, face-to-face interviews (the so-called CATI and CAPI methods or via online interviews. The number of interviews conducted varies depending upon the size and significance of a source market (from 2,000 interviews per year in smaller markets up to 24,000 interviews per year in large markets). Altogether, approximately 500,000 interviews are conducted annually on behalf of the "World Travel Monitor®".
This large sample size translates into better quality and yields a stronger, more profound statistical analysis of the data acquired. It also allows a considerably more precise analytical market segmenting so that reliable information can be furnished even on smaller segments. 
All the important parameters of travel are surveyed using a standardized questionnaire, the basic questions of which have remained unchanged since 1988. The questionnaire used for the "World Travel Monitor® / European Travel Monitor®" factors in both a determination of travel volume (number of trips taken abroad) as well as numerous individual trip characteristics. Apart from the number of trips/overnights, the following parameters are identified:

Profile.
TiGenix's scientific background and expertise lies in the developmental biology of cartilage, bone and other connective tissues. The insights of Tigenix's scientific founders led to the development of a technology platform focused on finding solutions for damaged and diseased cartilage. The company exploits the power of regenerative medicine to develop durable treatments, validated through controlled prospective multi-centre clinical trials.
According to TiGenix, current cartilage repair therapies do not provide satisfying, long-term durable repair. It therefore believes that there is a need for more long-lasting and effective treatments for cartilage damage. TiGenix is developing a portfolio of products addressing specific musculosceletal problems. The lead indication is cartilage damage, which is debilitating affliction affecting the mobility and functioning of patients.

Sub-genres.
The stage works of Offenbach (with the two exceptions of the opéras "Die Rheinnixen" and "The Tales of Hoffmann") are broadly referred to as 'operettas' in English references, even though only 16 of them were designated as opérettes by the composer. Offenbach called a further 8 opérette bouffe, and there is a single 'opérette fantastique'. There are 24 opéras comiques, and 24 opéras bouffes, together with 2 'opéras bouffes féeries'.
Other minor subgenres include opéra bouffon (5), bouffonnerie musicale (3), saynète (2) pièce d'occasion (2) and revue (2). Offenbach invented names for some individual works: 'anthropophagie musicale', 'chinoiserie musicale', 'comédie à ariettes', 'conversation alsacienne', 'légende bretonne', and 'légende napolitaine'. There are also one each of the following; 'fantasie musicale', 'opéra féerie', 'tableau villageois', and 'valse'.
Pastiche.
Theatres in the English-speaking centres used music by Offenbach to create pasticcio during the 1860s and 70s. Many of these pieces were made to libretti completely unknown to Offenbach. Vienna also saw examples of re-use of his music, and the practice continued into the 20th century. Examples include:
"Le carnaval des revues" and "Les hannetons" include pre-existing scores but were created under Offenbach and include some new music by him.

<doc id="19073628" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19073628" title="Makalös">
Makalös

Makalös (meaning "peerless" or "unrivalled" in Swedish) was the colloquial name for the grand mansion, or palace, of the Swedish noble family De la Gardie. Situated at Norrström, south of Kungsträdgården in Stockholm and vis-à-vis the Royal Palace, the building was completed in 1653 and demolished in 1825 after a fire.
Construction.
Construction of the mansion was begun in the 1630s on a piece of land owned by Jakob De la Gardie. De la Gardie tasked Hans Jacob Kristler with the construction. The five-floor building was built of brick and stone with a copper roof. The living quarters were situated in the ground floor, the festivities hall on the second (piano nobile), dancing and music rooms on the third, and stores and armoury on the fourth and fifth floors. The cellar comprised larders, while housekeeping facilities, stables and gardens were situated outside the main building. Four towers marked the corners of a facade richly decorated with stone masonry and adorned with bay windows and column-supported loggias in Italian style. The interior was equally splendid, with stucco decorations, picturesque plafonds, tapestries, decorative masonry, and galleries of paintings.
At the time of construction, the building's size and architecture stood in stark contrast to the humble surroundings and were unrivalled in Sweden. Although the mansion was colloquially known as "Makalös", the De la Gardie family referred to it exclusively as "Stora huset" ("the great house").
Use.
Jakob De la Gardie died in 1652 and his widow Ebba Brahe moved into a mansion in Götgatan that had formerly been owned by the De Geer family. Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie inherited Makalös, together with the family's extensive properties in Sweden and Finland. The reduction in 1684 cost him the greatest part of his property, with the exception of Venngarn castle, where he died two years later. Under the ownership of the crown, Makalös was used as a warehouse and later as an arsenal and armoury for over a century. When Sweden's reigning aesthete Gustav III decided to reorganise the capital's theatres, it was chosen as the venue for the Royal Dramatic Theatre, an institution that exists to this day. The theatre, then named "Nya Dramatiska Teatern", opened in 1793. It was also known as the "arsenal theatre".
Destruction by fire.
On 24 November 1825, a fire broke out during a performance. When a smell of smoke was felt, actor Lars Hjortsberg, speaking from the stage, informed the audience of this and asked them to leave the building. All spectators were safely evacuated, though three employees died in the fire. The building suffered severe damage and was subsequently torn down. A number of stone sculptures were saved, some of which were incorporated into private mansions, and others ended up in several museums, such as the Nordic Museum. A number of artifacts are exhibited at the Stockholm Metro's Kungsträdgården station, close to the former location of Makalös.
Scale model.
A detailed model of the mansion is exhibited at Stockholm City Museum.

"Diana and Callisto" is part of a series of seven famous canvasses, the "poesies", depicting mythological scenes from Ovid's "Metamorphoses" painted for Philip II of Spain after Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor had declined Titian's offer to paint them for him. The work remained in the Spanish royal collection until 1704 when King Philip V gave it to the French ambassador. It was soon acquired by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, nephew of Louis XIV, and Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV, for his collection, one of the finest ever assembled. After the French Revolution, the Orleans collection was sold to a Brussels banker by Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans in 1791, two years before he was guillotined. It was sent to London for sale in 1793 and purchased by a syndicate of three aristocrats, the leader of which, the canal and coal-magnate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, bought a large number of paintings for himself, including "Diana and Callisto" and "Diana and Actaeon" (both from the "poesie" series), eight paintings by Poussin, three Raphaels and Rembrandt's "Self-Portrait, aged 51".
Sutherland collection.
Bridgewater was probably inspired to buy the paintings by his nephew, Earl Gower, the ancestor of the Dukes of Sutherland. Certainly, on Bridgewater's death five years after the purchase, he bequeathed the Titians and the rest of his collection to Gower, who put it on display to the public in his Bridgewater House in London where it would remain on public display for the next century and a half. Upon first seeing the collection there, William Hazlitt wrote "I was staggered when I saw the works ... A new sense came upon me, a new heaven and a new Earth stood before me." At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the collection was moved from London to Scotland. Since 1945, both "Diana and Actaeon" and "Diana and Callisto" (with other paintings from the collection, known collectively as "the Bridgewater loan" or "the Sutherland Loan") have resided at the National Gallery of Scotland (NGS) in Edinburgh. Besides Hazlitt, during their time on public display the two Titian paintings have inspired such other artists as JMW Turner and Lucian Freud — Freud has described the pair as "simply the most beautiful pictures in the world".
National acquisition.
The Sutherland collection has passed by descent to Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland, most of whose wealth is contained in the paintings collection, but who, in late August 2008 announced his wish to sell some of the collection in order to diversify his assets. He at first offered them as a pair to the British national galleries at £100m (a third of their overall estimated market price) if they could demonstrate by the end of 2008 that they could raise that sum — if not, the pair or other paintings from the Bridgewater collection would be put on public auction in 2009. The NGS and the National Gallery in London announced that they would combine forces to raise £50m (or a demonstration that this money could be raised) to purchase "Diana and Actaeon" paid over three years in instalments and then £50m for "Diana and Callisto" to be paid for similarly from 2013.
Though the campaign received criticism from John Tusa and Nigel Carrington for the Duke's motives and for distracting from funding art students, it gained press support in the UK. In 14 October 2008 the appeal received £1 million from the Art Fund and on 19 November this was followed by £10 million from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.
Speculation began when the original December 31 deadline passed without news and the Scottish Government's announcement of a contribution of £17.5 million in January 2009 triggered a political row, with Ian Davidson questioning the deal at a time of economic hardship. There was also controversy over attempts to dilute the guarantee that the duke would sell no other of the paintings from the Sutherland Loan should the two Titians be bought. Finally, on February 2, 2009 it was announced that, thanks to the deadline being extended to raise more funds and finalise the payment plan for the "Diana and Callisto", £50m had been raised and the painting would be acquired. Dr. Nicholas Penny of the National Gallery stated that many who had contributed to the "Diana and Actaeon" appeal had done so "on the understanding" that "Diana and Callisto" would also be purchased, but that raising the second £50m was "not going to be easily raised. We do believe we can do it, and we've given it a great deal of thought. It's not just reckless gambling.". However, on October 23, 2011, the Scottish government announced it would not make a contribution to the "Diana and Callisto" appeal, referring to its contribution to the "Diana and Actaeon" appeal by stating that "this government has made its contribution to the campaign". After a lengthy fundraising campaign, the National Gallery and the National Galleries of Scotland purchased the painting for £45 million in March 2012, the asking price having been reduced by £5 million by the Duke of Sutherland - £15 million had been raised by individual and trust donations, £2 million from the Art Fund and £3 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The remaining £25 million came from the National Gallery's reserves, leaving them (in its director's words) "depleted" The painting is to be displayed with "Diana and Actaeon" on a rotating basis in London and Edinburgh, starting with London from 1 March 2012 - for the "Diana and Callisto", this will be on a 60:40 basis in favour of London, to reflect the National Gallery's greater monetary contribution to the purchase.

Ganderbal district

Ganderbal District ( (Perso-Arabic)) is a newly formed district of the state of Jammu and Kashmir of India. It was formerly 2 tehsils (Ganderbal and Kangan) of Srinagar District.
Historic sites and remains.
Ganderbal, like the rest of the Kashmir Valley, has witnessed many vicissitudes and experienced many upheavals from time to time. No significant ancient building or archaeological site is found in the district today, except for the Naranag temple, as most of the ancient architectural monuments in the area were destroyed during the rule of Sultan Sikander. What must have once been magnificent architectural show pieces are now in grand ruins.
Kheer Bhawani.
Kheer Bawani temple is constructed over a sacred spring situated in village Tulmulla, from the district headquarters of Ganderbal. It is among the ancient temples of Kashmir which has stood even today in its original form of architecture, when most of other temples were destroyed. It is dedicated to the Goddess Kheer Bhawani (originally just Bhawani). The worship of Kheer Bhawani is universal among the Hindus of Kashmir, and other parts of India. A week long pilgrimage has been restored in the month of may every year in which thousands of devotees visits the temple.
Naranag Temple.
The Naranag temple is one of the important archaeological sites of the country. Naranag, a group of temples, is situated in the lap of Harmukh Mountain about from Srinagar city. The site consists of a cluster of temples facing each other at a distance of about . Historians say that the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva by the 8th-century ruler Lalithdatiya muktadiya. It is believed that the king Awantivarman paid a visit and donated a pedestal for bathing at Bhutsher. Even today one gets surprised over art and skill of the builders of this temple. Its impressive architecture reveals the glorious past, the magnificent art of the 8th century. The government has only recently constructed walls to protect it from encroachments and nothing else has been done. It is now left in ruins of which only faint traces have survived. This temple has the typical Aryan structure as was present in Aryan Kashmir.
Geography.
Ganderbal district, with its district headquarters located at , at an average elevation of above sea level, at a distance of from Srinagar city.
Ganderbal district is spread across the Sind River. The river is considered as the lifeline of the district. It is the only river in Jammu and Kashmir state on which three hydroelectric power stations are functional; besides that the river provides water for irrigation, 80% population of the district is engaged with farming. The sand (bajri) of this river has a great value for money for its quality.
The district is constituted into three tehsils:
It is further divided into four blocks: Ganderbal, Wakoora, Lar and Kangan. Each block consists of a number of panchayats.
Ganderbal District has 2 assembly constituencies: Kangan and Ganderbal.
Climate.
Ganderbal district possesses all the typical characteristics of the climate of Kashmir Valley as a whole. In the heat of July, the breeze of Nallah Sindh is enough for relief. Sir Walter Lawrence writes in his book "The Valley of Kashmir" that in latitude, Kashmir corresponds with Peshawar, Baghdad and Damascus in Asia: with Fez in Morocco: and South Carolina in America, but it presents none of the characteristics of those countries. People have linked the climate of Kashmir to that of Switzerland until the end of May, and of Southern France in July and August. But it is impossible to speak of Kashmir as possessing any one climate or group of characteristics. Every hundred feet of elevation brings some new phase of climate and of vegetation.
Tourism.
The Ganderbal district is not only the valley of Nallah Sindh, it is equally rich in landscape. It has great exposure in adventure tourism. The nature has been generous in gifting the district with places of unparalleled beauty. It is obvious to call it as the district of lakes, as it possesses the most number of lakes in the whole State. Before the advent of armed insurrection in the state, these lakes were the main attraction for foreign tourists who used used to visit these places so often. But since the early 1990s, strategic areas of all of these pleasure spots have been occupied by Indian army and paramilitary forces. In addition, the government has preferred a policy of environmentally hazardous development program which mainly consist of building concrete structures in these places, thus harming their natural beauty and the ecological balance.
Sonamarg.
This world-famous hill station is situated from Srinagar and located on the banks of Nallah Sindh at an altitude of meters. Sonamarg, once a great tourist puller and favourite place for shooting of Bollywood films, is perhaps the best health resort in the country. Sonamarg also hosts the International Championships of Rafting on Nallah Sindh. It presents a glamorous look due to its alpine meadows, snow-clad mountains, and healthy climate. Sonamarg skirts Nallah Sindh river and torrential flow of water in this river enriches its awesome beauty. Besides several hotels in private sector have come up here and these hotels provide modern facilities to their guests. A number of treks in this region also begin from Sonamarg to high altitude lakes of Vishansar, Krishansar, Gadsar and Gangabal stocked with snow trout and brown trout.
Manasbal Lake.
Manasbal Lake is the main attraction for tourists in Ganderbal district, north west of district headquarters of Ganderbal. It is long and wide. It is located in the Jhelum valley, north of Srinagar city in the State of Jammu and Kashmir in India. The name Manasbal is said to be a derivative of the Lake Manasarovar. Lake is encircled by three villages: Jarokbal, Kondabal (also called Kiln place; is situated on the north-eastern side of the lake) and Ganderbal and is stated to be the deepest lake (at depth) in the Kashmir valley. The large growth of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) at the periphery of the lake (blooms during July and August) adds to the beauty of the clear waters of the lake. The Mughal garden, called the Garoka, (meaning bay window) built by Nur Jahan overlooks the lake.
The lake is a good place for birdwatching as it is one of the largest natural stamping grounds of Aquatic birds in Kashmir and has the sobriquet of "supreme gem of all Kashmir Lakes". The rootstocks of lotus plant which grows extensively in the lake are harvested and marketed, and also eaten by the local people.
The lake is approached from Srinagar by a road via Shadipur, Nasim and Gandarbal. Road to Wular Lake, the largest lake in Kashmir, passes through this lake, via Safapur.
Harmukh.
Harmukh (also known as Mount Haramukh or Harmukh mountain) is a mountain with a peak elevation of , in Ganderbal district of Indian occupied Kashmir. Harmukh is part of the Himalaya Range, and is located between Nallah Sindh to its south and Neelum River to its north. It rises from Gangabal Lake in the vicinity of Kashmir valley. It is more hazardous to reach Mount Haramukh from the east and south side of Ganderbal and has never been climbed from these sides; thus, it is mostly climbed in the north-west from the Arin Bandipore side.
Harmukh was first climbed by the Great Trigonometric Survey's Thomas Montgomerie in 1856 and made the first survey of the Karakoram some to the south, and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labelling them K1 and K2.
Harmukh was later climbed by many other climbers. Therefore, Harmukh is the mountain from which the world‘s 2nd highiest mountain peak K2 was discovered and the Serveyer‘s mark K2 continues to be the name.
Gangabal Lake.
Gangabal Lake (Urdu:-ﮔﻨﮕﺒﻞ ﺟﮭﻴﻞ), also called Gangbal Lake, is a lake situated at the foothills of Mount Haramukh (the highest mountain peak in the vicinity of Kashmir valley) in Ganderbal district, north of Srinagar city in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in India. It is an alpine high altitude oligotrophic lake, and is home to many types of fishes of which one is the brown trout.
The lake has a maximum length of and maximum width of . It is fed by precipitation, glaciers and springs. The lake water outflows to a nearby small lake (Nundakol) to Nallah Sindh The trout fishes are present in the lake.
Gangabal lake is approached from Srinagar by road via Ganderbal up to Naranag and then a track upslope.

John Gilbert (agent)

John Gilbert (1724–1795) was land agent and engineer to the third Duke of Bridgewater and is credited with the idea that led to the building of the Bridgewater Canal.
John Gilbert was born in Staffordshire. When he was aged 12–13 he was apprenticed to Matthew Boulton, a manufacturer of small metal objects and the father of Matthew Boulton, the engineer. When Gilbert was aged 19 his father died and he left his apprenticeship to superintend the family lime works. John's brother, Thomas, was working as agent to Lord Gower, brother-in-law of the Duke of Bridgewater. Thomas invited John to inspect the Duke's coal mines at Worsley, and here John suggested the idea of a canal, to drain the mines and to convey the coal. Around 1758 John was appointed as the Duke's agent and moved to live in Worsley. Here he started on the levelling and surveying work necessary for this project. Later James Brindley was appointed as engineer to the canal and the Duke, Gilbert and Brindley worked on the plans for the canal and supervised its building from Worsley Old Hall.
For the Duke, Gilbert also ran the demesne farm and set up a lead pencil factory at Worsley using plumbago from the Duke's mines in Keswick. When lime was found on the Duke's estate, Gilbert's previous experience helped to develop lime burning as an additional source of revenue. As separate undertakings, Gilbert worked on the drainage of Martin Mere and in the reclamation of the northern portion of Chat Moss. In the 1770s Gilbert worked as agent for the Duke of Devonshire working on a project to build an underground canal for his Ecton Hill mines. This canal now leads to Speedwell Cavern. In the 1780s Gilbert developed the first deep salt mine at Marston Mine near the Lion Salt Works in Cheshire. At the time of his death work was proceeding to his design of an inclined plane within the Worsley mining system.

Autostrada A4 (Italy)

The Autostrada A4, or Serenissima, is a motorway which connects Turin and Trieste via Milan and Venice. The city of Venice (or rather, Mestre which is the "land" part of Venice) originally formed a bottleneck on the A4, but is now bypassed by the Passante di Mestre (the old route through Mestre was renumbered A57). The A4 passes through the city of Milan, where it is toll-free.
Due to the different companies that manage the different parts of the motorway, it is often referred to as formed by five sections: Turin-Milan, Milan-Brescia, Brescia-Padua, Padua-Venice and Venice-Trieste. As it runs though the whole Pianura Padana, which is a densely populated and highly industrialized area, A4 is one of the most trafficked motorways of Italy.
A4 is a dual-carriageway, six-lane motorway for most of its length. The stretch between Milano Est tollgate and Bergamo is an eight-lane motorway since 30 September 2007. The stretch from Venice to Trieste is instead still a four-lane motorway, but it is planned to upgrade this stretch over motorway to six lanes.
Passante di Mestre.
The passante di Mestre is a part of the A4 motorway, opened to traffic on 8 February 2009. The objective of the route is to reduce the volume of auto- and truck-based traffic passing through Mestre (a mainland "frazione" of Venice) to reach non-local destinations like Austria, Slovenia and other Eastern European countries.

History.
Kulgam a picturesque town is situated at 75° 268’ E longitude and 33°1584’ N latitude nestled in the lap of Peer Panchal Ranges overlooking the left bank of River Veshaw and has come up along a sloppy Karewa from Larow to Chawalgam. Be it the interaction with other civilizations, absorption of religious and other socio economic movements having swept sub-continent/Asia and above all the mythology associated with river Veshaw, emanating from the Kounsernag and flowing with majesty as well as ferociously depending upon the season and climatic conditions and at times resembling the prowess of mythological God/Angel when viewed in the context of its irrigation potential and utilization thereof in the District becoming the main source.Kulgam has the distinction of having contributed in the evolution of present day soda-cultural ethos of Kashmir hinged in sobriety, compassion, non-violence, yearning for learning and receptiveness for new ideas and reformation with no parallel in terms of recorded history in the sub-continent. Tazkira Sadat-i-Simanania, compiled by Swaleh Reshi, a reputed scholar and poet of 13th Century, contains the name of place as “Shampora” which was later on renamed as Kulgam by Syed
Hussain Simnani (RA) when beholden with the myriad number of Canals and streams flowing through the village. The word Kulgam denotes “Kul” meaning thereby the “Whole” and the “Gam” in Arabic to “teach righteousness”. It is he who is stated to have invited Hazrat Amir Kabir Mir Hamdani (RA) to Kashmir and famous poet and poetess like Sheikh Noor-ud-din Noorani and Lal Ded respectively to Kulgam where
their disciples manifesting the composite culture promoted and encouraged it even when the dissension in rest of the Asiatic countries was taken as heretics. Kulgam as such is believed to be a place acting as a torch bearer for righteousness in the circumspection of myriad streams running through the area. The form of administration which was rudimentary but gained semblance of a structured system
during Shair Shah Suri’s reign led to creation of a Tehsil eventually during Mughal Rule through the aegis of Sheikh Hamza Makhdoom (RA) with jurisdiction encompassing places like Doru, Banihal, Gulabgarh, Shopian and thereafter the status continued but in the process, its constituent units like Pulwama and now along with it Shopian, Reasi attained the status of a District. Such is the climatic and topographical treasure in the District that from Mughal Emperors to Dogra Rulers the area has had been a hunting place especially for Shahanshah Shah Jehan who laid the Chinarbagh and Maharaja Hari Singh who discovered the virgin potential of sanctuary at Kutbal. From out of the spiritual, great poets and statesman like politicians the District has distinction of being the birthplace of Sheikh Noor-ud-din Noorani, the founder of Reshi culture and native place of the forefathers of Alama Iqbal and Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru.

Before confluence of Veshev with the Jhelum it gets broken off into a number of channels providing drinking water facilities and irrigation to huge tracts of the land of the District.
Town Kulgam is situated at a distance of about 68 km from Srinagar and about 17 km from Anantnag. It has road connectivity with its neighboring districts like Shopian, Pulwama, Anantnag and Ramban. Town of Kulgam is linked with far flung areas of the District by a dependable road network.

Finland–Kosovo relations

Finland–Kosovo relations are foreign relations between Finland and the Republic of Kosovo. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and Finland recognized it on 7 March 2008. Finland maintains an Embassy in Pristina.
History.
In 1999, the President of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, was reported as wanting to step up attempts to secure a peace agreement for Kosovo in his new role as a leading negotiator for the European Union. It was also reported that "Correspondents say that despite Mr Ahtisaari's support for air strikes, his position as president of a non-NATO country could make him palatable to Belgrade Government." In 2007, United Nations envoy for Kosovo says independence was the "only viable option" for the territory of Kosovo.
However, Ahtisaari's plan for peace failed and he was unable to reconcile Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo and that "Serbians see him as a leading player in the break-up of their country." 
Following Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, Kosovo Albanians living in Finland celebrated and expressed their gratitude to the Finnish Government and President Ahtisaari.
Military.
Finland currently has 411 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO led Kosovo Force.

List of rulers of Zeta

After Constantin Bodin's death, fighting among his potential successors weakened the state of Duklja and the region succumbed to Rascia's reign between 1183 and 1186.
In 1190, Grand Župan of Rascia Stefan Nemanja's son, Vukan II, asserted his right to the Dukljan crown. In 1219, the regent of Zeta and King Vukan's oldest son, Đorđe Nemanjić, became king of Duklja/Zeta. He was succeeded by his second oldest son, Uroš I, who built the 'Uspenje Bogorodice' monastery in Morača.
Between 1276 and 1309, Zeta was ruled by Queen Jelena, widow of Serbia's King Uroš I. She restored around 50 monasteries in the region--- most notably Saint Srđ and Vakh on the Bojana River. The name "Crna Gora" (Montenegro) was formally mentioned for the first time in 1296, in the charter of St. Nicholas' monastery in Vranjina. This charter was issued by the Serbian King Stefan Milutin Nemanjić, who was the youngest son of Uroš I and Jelena Kurtene. "Crna Gora" (Montenegro) was to be understood as the highland region under Mount Lovćen, within the confines of Zeta. By the beginning of the 14th century, during King Milutin's reign, the Archdiocese in Bar was the strongest feudal lord in Zeta.
From 1309 to 1321, Zeta was co-ruled by the oldest son of King Milutin, Young King Stefan Uroš III Dečanski. Similarly, from 1321 to 1331, Stefan's young son Stefan Dušan Uroš IV Nemanjić, the future Serbian King and Tsar, co-ruled Zeta with his father.
After Tsar Dušan's death in 1355, the Serbian state Kingdom started to crumble and its holdings were divided among Prince (Knjaz) Lazar Hrebeljanović, the short-lived (1353–1391) Bosnian state of Tvrtko I Kotromanić, and a semi-independent chiefdom of Zeta under the House of Balšić, whose founder Balša I came to power in 1356.
Zeta.
The region of Zeta was a part of the Serbian Empire reigned by the House of Nemanjić. In the mid-14th century in the Lower Zeta region, a minor nobility family known as the House of Balšić comes to prominence (during the reign of Tsar Dušan; ca. 1360 they have become one of the major nobility groups within the Empire, recognized as such local lords of Zeta under Tsar Uroš. The Serbian Empire becomes ever-fragmented as local lords become acting ever-more independently, the Balsics included; after the Battle of Marica in 1371 emperor Uroš dies and no one succeeds him at the Throne.
In 1421 the Balšić family is succeeded by the House of Lazarević.
House of Balšić.
The Balšić family members all had their own lands which they held collectively, but they were at various times presided by a Head of the Family: 
House of Branković.
In 1427 the Serbian despot died and the throne through adoptive lineage passes on to the House of Branković, according to the treaty; they inherit the Zetan territories. The Lazarevic and Brankovic houses use the legitimate right they had succeeded from the Balsics in order to claim supremacy over the Crnojevic house as well, in the Upper Zeta region (Montenegro proper).
In 1456 the last Serbian bastion in Zeta, the fortifications of Medun, are conquered by the Ottoman forces of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror.
House of Crnojević.
The House of Crnojević was a dynasty ruling in the Medieval state of Zeta, first struggling with House of Balšić for control over Zeta, and then succeeding them as Zeta's supreme overlords throughout the 14th and 15th century. Since the second half of the 15th century, they would play a crucial role in the survival of late Medieval Zeta. All members of the House of Crnojević considered themselves "Lords Zetan".

Refractory (planetary science)

In planetary science, any material that has a relatively high equilibrium condensation temperature is called refractory. The opposite of refractory is volatile.
The refractory group includes elements and compounds like metals and silicates (commonly termed rocks) which make up the bulk of the mass of the terrestrial planets, asteroids in the inner belt. A fraction of the mass of other asteroids, giant planets, their moons and trans-Neptunian objects is also made of refractory materials.
Classification.
The refractory elements can be divided into several categories: 
The condensation temperatures are the temperatures at which 50% of the element will be in the form of a solid (rock) under a pressure of 10−4 bar. However, slightly different groups and temperature ranges are used sometimes. Refractory material are also often divided into refractory Lithophile elementss and refractory Siderophile elementss.

Royal Thomian Regatta

The event generally known as Royal Thomian Regatta or The Regatta is the annual rowing race between Royal College, Colombo and S. Thomas' College, Mt Lavinia having begun in 1962 as the Royal Thomian Boat Race that evolved into a regatta in 1966 and now is made up of 8 events.
The races are rowed over a distance of 1000 yards and take place on the Beira Lake in Colombo. The regatta takes place in the month of October and is usually held on the last Saturday of the month at the Colombo Rowing Club. The Royal Thomian Regatta is the oldest inter-school rowing regatta in Sri Lanka, with Royal the first school to take up school rowing in the country.
The Boat Race is still regarded as the most prestigious race. The Boat Race is rowed for the Royal Thomian Boat Race Trophy (Also known in the rowing fraternity as the 'Crossed Oars'). The overall winner of the Regatta is awarded the T. Noel Fernando Memorial Trophy.
Having begun in 1962 'The Regatta' is the 3rd oldest sporting encounter between Royal College and S. Thomas' College, after the Battle of the Blues Cricket Encounter and Rugby Encounter.
History.
Royal College first began rowing in 1953 as the first school in Ceylon to do so, the first Captain was Alavi Mohomed. S. Thomas' College began rowing a few years later.
In the years to follow the idea of a race between the two schools was agreed upon and in 1962 the 1st Boat Race was held on the Beira Lake and the Royalist's led by L.A.W. Sirisena beat the Thomians led by C.N. Sirimanne by 1 boat length and were the first holders of the Boat Race Trophy.
S. Thomas won their first Boat Race in 1964 beating Royal by 3 lengths.
In 1966, the 1st Royal Thomian Regatta was held with a line-up of 6 events. Coxed Fours, Coxed Pairs, Single Sculls in two categories Senior and Junior.
Between 1973 and 1979 the regatta was not held due to a dispute between the two schools.
The series was revived in 1980 and continues to the present except in 2006 when the regatta was not held.
In 2007 the Royal College led by Maalik Aziz created history by winning all races and winning the Overall Trophy with a margin of 40 points to nil. Royal College created new record timings for most events including lowering the Boat Race Trophy record by 8 secs to 3 mins 11 secs.
In 2008, history was written yet again although in a different manner with every record being broken as a result of tough competition on either side. Though S'Thomas College led by Manil Salgadoe and Devaan Hallock made most of the records including the Boat race(3.06), Royal college too managed to scrape in two records to stay in the count(Junior coxed Fours, Junior 'B' Coxed Fours).
In 2011, the Royal College Rowing Team led by skipper Chirath Karunanayake added a few more records into the books. Among the records set were;
a) The biggest winning margin Royal 48-04 (2011)(Previously held by Royal 40 -00 in 2007)
b) A new overall course record AND the first ever sub-three minute race, for the Senior Four - 2:55 (Crew consisting of Chirath Karunanayake (B), Ajmal Sideek (2), Jehan Smarasekera (3), Sanjiva Jayasuriya (S) and Coxed by Pasan Ranaweera)
c) Junior Four - 3:03
d) Senior Pair - 3:12
e) Senior Sculls - 3:28
f) Junior Sculls - 3:29
Race Format.
All Races are rowed over the distance of 1000 yards.
Each event has specific number of points allotted towards it the aggregate points is equal 40 points (up to 2008), the winner of the each event/race receives these points and at the end of the regatta the school with the highest aggregate of points will be declared the Overall Winner and be the holders of the T. Noel Fernando Trophy.
In 1999, The Junior 'B' Coxed Fours was introduced but the event carries no points.
In 2008, Senior and Junior Double Sculls will be introduced as exhibition events. In 2009 Senior and Junior Double Sculls were awarded 8 and 4 points respectively, with inclusion of the two doubles sculls the overall regatta will be worth 52 points.

Percy Deane

Percival Edgar Deane CMG (10 August 1890–17 August 1946) was an Australian public servant.
Deane was born in Port Melbourne, the son of a carpenter. He won a scholarship to University High School, Melbourne, and then worked as a typewriter salesman, shorthand writer, and clerk at the University of Melbourne, before going into business, becoming part-owner of two companies, and founding and editing "Australian Golfer" (being an outstanding golfer himself).
On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was posted to the 1st Australian General Hospital in Egypt, where he was commissioned Lieutenant and Quartermaster. In April 1916 he was invalided back to Australia suffering from overstrain.
In November 1916 he was appointed private secretary to Prime Minister Billy Hughes. He was secretary to the Australian delegation to the Versailles Conference, for which he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours, and to the Australian delegations to the Imperial Conferences of 1921 and 1926. In February 1921 he was appointed Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department and in 1929 Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs until its abolition in 1932. From 1932 until his retirement on medical grounds (with myocarditis) in 1936, he was a member of the War Pensions Entitlement Appeals Tribunal.
Deane's fall from grace probably contributed to his ill-health. He broke a hip in a fall and became bedridden, eventually dying of cancer at the age of 56.

Aimé Maeght

Aimé Maeght (27 April 1906, Hazebrouck, northern France – 5 September 1981) was a French art collector and editor. He founded the Galerie Maeght in Paris and New York, and the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul-de-Vence near Nice (southern France). 
The surname Maeght is pronounced "mahg".
Art dealer.
As a youth, Maeght studied art and music. His first commercial encounter in the art world came in 1930, when Bonnard came to his Cannes shop and had Maeght print a program for a Maurice Chevalier concert with a Bonnard lithograph. After the programs were produced, Maeght put the lithograph in the print-shop window. A quick sale encouraged the artist to give him a second picture. Maeght made his Paris debut as a major art dealer on the Rue de Teheran in 1945, after World War II. On sale were all the paintings done by Matisse during the war. Much of his success as a dealer was attributed to his wife, the late Marguerite Maeght.

William John Evelyn (Conservative politician)

Commonly known as William John Evelyn (27 July 1822 - 1908), a descendant of the diarist and polymath John Evelyn, eldest son of George Evelyn and Mary Jane Massy Dawson. He had inherited the large Wotton estate in Surrey, and was often referred to locally as "the Squire".
He went to Cheam School from 1835 until 1837 when he then went to Rugby, and from there to Balliol College, Oxford where he obtained his Masters degree in 1844. 
He was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Western Surrey at a by-election in 1849, and re-elected in 1852. He stood down at the next (1857) general election and spent a year in 1860 as High Sheriff of Surrey. He later returned to the House of Commons as Member for Deptford in 1885, resigning in 1888 by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead after falling out with his party as a result of events in Mitchelstown, Ireland where police shot on protesters and killed three people. Subsequently Lord Salisbury's government accepted the police version of events and refused to condemn their actions; Evelyn was horrified by this and resigned from parliament. The by-election which followed would be contested by his good friend Wilfred Scawen Blunt from an Irish prison. Evelyn thoroughly disapproved of the Boer War, he considered it had been made in the interest of capitalists and that it was unjust and cruel. At the time this could have been thought unpatriotic of him.
In 1869, on the closing of the Deptford Dockyard, he purchased back from the government as much of the site of Sayes Court as was available and by 1876 was turning some of this into a recreation ground for his Deptford tenants. In 1886 he dedicated an acre and a half of the Sayes Court recreation ground that he had created, in perpetuity to the public and a permanent provision was made for the Evelyn estate to cover the expense of maintenance and caretaking. In 1884 he sold land then being used as market gardens in Deptford to the London County Council for less than its market value, as well as paying £2000 towards the cost of its purchase. This was officially opened to the public as Deptford Park on 7 June 1897.

David DiChiera

David DiChiera ( ; born 8 April 1935 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania) is an American composer and founding general director of Michigan Opera Theatre.
Career.
DiChiera, son of Italian immigrants, was raised in Los Angeles, California, and graduated with highest honors from UCLA in 1956. When he received a Master's degree in Composition at UCLA, he was selected to be a Fulbright scholar for studies in Italy where he conducted extensive research on unpublished manuscripts of eighteenth century opera. This led to a series of articles for the world's leading music encyclopedias including Ricordi's "Enciclopedia Della Musica", "Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians" and Bärenreiter's "Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart".
Returning to UCLA, DiChiera worked there as an instructor and received his Ph.D. in Musicology. In 1962, DiChiera joined the faculty of music of the newly established Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. From 1963 to 1965, he also held the post of Assistant Dean for Continuing Education in the Arts at Oakland University and was thereafter elected Chairman of the Department of Music.
In 1971 DiChiera became the founding General Director of Michigan Opera Theatre. At the same time, he became the founding Artistic Director of the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts. From 1979 to 1983 DiChiera served as president of Opera America. In this role, he developed the "Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund/Opera for a New America Program", which encouraged and supported companies to reach previously under-addressed segments of the population, and served to build bridges into America’s increasingly diverse population.
From 1981 to 1993, DiChiera was appointed Artistic Director of the Dayton Opera Association. In 1986 he was appointed founding General Director of the newly formed Opera Pacific in Orange County; he filled that post until 1996, when he resigned to devote more time to the opening of the Detroit Opera House.
In April 1996, noted opera singer Joan Sutherland cut the ribbon to celebrate the grand opening of the restored Detroit Opera House under DiChiera's stewardship.
During his career, David DiChiera has served as a trustee for the National Institute of Music Theatre and as a board member of the American Arts Alliance. He has been a panel member for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and chairman for the Opera/Musical Theater Panel. He has also chaired several national music conferences. DiChiera chaired the second annual conference of the International Association of Lyric Theatre, convened in Verona, Italy, and was twice elected vice president of that organization.
He has two daughters with Karen VanderKloot DiChiera, daughter of Robert VanderKloot, a Detroit amateur musician and himself
a founding member of the Michigan Opera Theatre. Karen VanderKloot DiChiera, a composer, educator and stage director, is also a founder and director of Michigan Opera Theatre's Department of Community Programs.
Works.
His "Four Sonnets" (1965), to verses by Edna St. Vincent Millay composed for soprano and piano, premiered in 1978 at the Kennedy Center in Washington to critical acclaim. A children's opera, "Rumpelstiltskin" (1973), written in collaboration with Karen VanderKloot DiChiera, has been performed nationally. In 2007 his opera "Cyrano" to a libretto by Bernard Uzan received its world premiere at the Detroit Opera House;
this work was successfully presented by Opera Company of Philadelphia in 2008 and premiered at Florida Grand Opera in 2011.
Awards.
DiChiera was awarded the Atwater Kent (UCLA) and Gershwin Awards. "The Detroit News" elected DiChiera "Michiganian of the Year" in 1979. In 2000 he received the "Bridge Builder's Award" by the "Partners for Livable Communities", a Washington–based civic leadership organization. In 2005, the "National Association of Negro Musicians" honored DiChiera for his continued support of African American artists. DiChiera delivered the commencement speech at the University of Michigan's graduation ceremony in 1998 and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree. He has also received honorary doctorates from Wayne State University, Oakland University and Marygrove College. In 2010, DiChiera received the NEA Opera Honors.

<doc id="19074150" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19074150" title="Autologous chondrocyte implantation">
Autologous chondrocyte implantation

Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI, ATC code ) is a biomedical treatment that repairs damages in articular cartilage. ACI provides pain relief while at the same time slowing down the progression or considerably delaying partial or total joint replacement (knee replacement) surgery. The goal of ACI is to allow people suffering from articular cartilage damage to return to their old lifestyle; regaining mobility, going back to work and even practicing sports again.
ACI procedures aim to provide complete hyaline repair tissues for articular cartilage repair. Over the last 20 years, the procedure has become more widespread and it is currently probably the most developed articular cartilage repair technique.
The surgical technique was first performed in Sweden in 1987; the results of the 9 year follow up are available in Peterson et al. 2000. Brittberg published the first description of the technique on humans in 1994. He reported good and promising results with 23 patients for defects on the femoral condyles (Brittberg et al., 1994).The technique also seems promising with regard to long-term results.
Procedure.
This cell based articular cartilage repair procedure takes place in three stages. In a first stage, between 200 and 300 milligrams cartilage is sampled arthroscopically from a less weight bearing area from either the intercondylar notch or the superior ridge of the medial or lateral femoral condyle of the patient. The matrix is removed enzymatically and the chondrocytes isolated. These cells are grown in vitro in a specialised laboratory for approximately four to six weeks, until there are enough cells to reimplant on the damaged area of the articular cartilage. The patient then undergoes a second treatment, in which the chondrocytes are applied on the damaged area during an open-knee surgery (also called arthrotomy). These autologous cells should adapt themselves to their new environment by forming new cartilage. During the implantation, chondrocytes are applied on the damaged area in combination with a membrane (tibial periosteum or biomembrane) or pre-seeded in a scaffold matrix.
ACI Complications.
The occurrence of subsequent surgical procedures (SSPs), primarily arthroscopy, following ACI is common. For example, in the Study of the Treatment of Articular Repair (STAR), 49% of Carticel ACI patients underwent an SSP on the treated knee, during the 4-year follow up. The most common serious adverse events (up to 5% of patients), include arthrofibrosis and joint adhesions, graft overgrowth, chondromalacia or chondrosis, cartilage injury, graft complication, meniscal lesion, graft delamination, and osteoarthritis. Source: Carticel.
A recent study from Germany, published in November 2008 issue of the American Journal of Sports Medicine, analyzed 349 ACI procedures of the knee joint. Three different ACI techniques were used. A major proportion of complications after ACI can be summarized by 4 major diagnoses: symptomatic hypertrophy, disturbed fusion, delamination, and graft failure. Among those, the overall complication rate and incidence of hypertrophy of the transplant were higher for periosteum-covered ACI. Furthermore, an increased rate of symptomatic hypertrophy was found for patellar defects. Source: Philipp Niemeyer, MD, et al.: Characteristic Complications After Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation for Cartilage Defects of the Knee Joint. The American Journal of Sports Medicine 36:2091-2099 (2008).
Randomized clinical studies.
Knutsen and coworkers have published the 2-year and 5-year follow-up results after surgery in patients randomized for ACI or microfracture treatment of localized articular defects of the knee joint. At the two-year follow-up the authors concluded that: "Both methods had acceptable short-term clinical results. There was no significant difference in macroscopic or histological results between the two treatment groups and no association between the histological findings and the clinical outcome at the two-year time-point." At the five-year follow-up the conclusions were similar: "Both methods provided satisfactory results in 77% of the patients at five years. There was no significant difference in the clinical and radiographic results between the two treatment groups and no correlation between the histological findings and the clinical outcome. One-third of the patients had early radiographic signs of osteoarthritis five years after the surgery. Further long-term follow-up is needed to determine if one method is better than the other and to study the progression of osteoarthritis."
Saris et al. studied histologic results and clinical outcome in a similar randomized study and concluded that: "One year after treatment, characterized chondrocyte implantation was associated with a tissue regenerate that was superior to that after microfracture. Short-term clinical outcome was similar for both treatments. The superior structural outcome 
may result in improved long-term clinical benefit with characterized chondrocyte implantation. Long-term follow-up is needed to confirm these findings."
At present it seems fair to conclude that the repair tissue formed by ACI is as good or possible slightly better than a less invasive and simpler surgical technique 1–2 years after the surgery. ACI has not yet been shown to give better clinical outcome than microfracture at short-term or medium-term follow-up.
Minas et al. studied clinical outcome in a cohort study of 321 patients. They found that defects treated by ACI, which had a prior treatment with marrow stimulating techniques, such as microfracture, were three times more likely to fail than for defects treated by ACI, which did not have a prior marrow stimulating technique. They concluded that marrow stimulating techniques should be employed judiciously in larger cartilage defects that may require future treatment with ACI.

PGF/TikZ

__NOTOC__
PGF/Ti"k"Z is a tandem of languages for producing vector graphics from a geometric/algebraic description. PGF is a lower-level language, while Ti"k"Z is a set of higher-level macros that use PGF. The top-level PGF and Ti"k"Z commands are invoked as TeX macros, but in contrast with PSTricks, the PGF/Ti"k"Z graphics themselves are described in a language that resembles MetaPost. Till Tantau is the designer of these languages, and he is also the main developer of the only known interpreter for PGF and Ti"k"Z, which is written in TeX. PGF is an acronym for "Portable Graphics Format". Ti"k"Z was introduced in version 1.10 of PGF, and it is a recursive acronym for "Ti"k"Z ist "kein" Zeichenprogramm" (German for "Ti"k"Z is "not" a drawing program").
The PGF/Ti"k"Z interpreter can be used from the popular LaTeX and ConTeXt macro packages, and also directly from the original TeX. Since TeX itself is not concerned with graphics, the interpreter supports multiple TeX output backends: dvips, dvipdfm/dvipdfmx/xdvipdfmx, TeX4ht, and pdftex's internal PDF output driver. Unlike PStricks, PGF can thus directly produce either PostScript or PDF output, but it cannot use some of the more advanced PostScript programming features that PStricks can use due to the "least common denominator" effect. PGF/Ti"k"Z comes with extensive documentation. The version 2.10 manual has 726 pages.
The standard LaTeX codice_1 environment can also be used as a front end for PGF merely by using the codice_2 package.
Several graphical editors can produce output for PGF/Ti"k"Z like the KDE program Cirkuit, and the math drawing program GeoGebra. Export to Ti"k"Z is also available as extensions for Inkscape, Blender, MATLAB, matplotlib, Gnuplot and R.
The project is still active . Most of the development is done by Till Tantau.
Version 3.0.0 was released 2013-12-20

Diks attended a school, specialized in arts between 1977 and 1983. She studied for a year at the Academy of Creative Art in Maastricht and continued to study at the Charles Montaigne Fashion Academy in Amsterdam between 1984 and 1986. Between 1987 and 1988, she worked as a stylist. After 1988, Diks worked as an independent designer of wedding dresses and evening gowns in Apeldoorn. In 2006, she left her business to move to Leeuwarden. Between 2002 and 2004, she studied cultural studies at the Open University (without graduating). From 2004, she studied International Relations at the University of Groningen, where she specialized in European cooperation, international law and European law. She has also owned and operated a bed and breakfast in Leeuwarden since 2006.
Diks had been active within GreenLeft since 1994, first in the municipal council of Apeldoorn, where she served as chair of the local parliamentary party and as member of the board of the regional water board, and later as member of the States-Provincial in Gelderland, where she served as vice-chair (2003–2006). Between 2006 and 2008, she was a member of the national board of GreenLeft, where she served as international secretary. In 2006, she stood on the list for the general election on the tenth place. She was not elected. 
In August 2008, it was announced that Diks would temporarily replace Mariko Peters as MP. Between September 1, 2008, and January 1, 2009, Peters would be on maternity leave. The Dutch House of Representatives has a special regulation that MPs on maternity leave may be replaced temporarily without giving up their seats. Formally, Matthieu Heemelaar was the candidate to succeed Peters as he was higher on the list, but he reqlinquished the honour to Diks since she, a specialist on international affairs and the international secretary of the party, had the expertise to replace Peters, the foreign affairs spokesperson of the GreenLeft.

Northern Bulgaria

Northern Bulgaria (, "Severna Balgariya"), also called Moesia (, "Misiya") is the northern half of the territory of Bulgaria, located to the north of the main ridge of the Balkan Mountains which conventionally separates the country into a northern and a southern part. Besides the Balkan Mountains, Northern Bulgaria borders the Timok River and Serbia to the west, the Danube River and Romania to the north and the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast to the east.
Geographically, the terrain is relatively uniform, dominated by the hilly Danubian Plain, with some low plateaus to the east. Northern Bulgaria covers an area of 48,596 square kilometres and has a population of 2,674,347 according to the 2011 census (36% of Bulgaria's entire population), with a population density of 55 people per km². The three largest cities are Varna, Rousse and Pleven.
Administratively, Northern Bulgaria includes the following 14 Bulgarian provinces:
Parts of Burgas Province, Sliven Province, and Sofia Province also geographically belong to Northern Bulgaria. 
Northern Bulgaria covers the historical region of Moesia, which in turn includes several sub-regions such as Dobruja (sometimes not considered part of Moesia), Ludogorie, Gerlovo and Zlatiya. Northern Bulgaria is also conventionally divided into Northwestern, Central Northern and Northeastern Bulgaria, with slightly varying borders. The lower northern reaches of the Balkan Mountains are called the Fore-Balkan, as opposed to the Sub-Balkan valleys to the south of the main ridge. In Antiquity, the Jireček Line divided Latin (in the north) and Ancient Greek (in the south) language influence in the Balkans, with Northern Bulgaria to the north of it and Southern Bulgaria to the south. Much later, after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, all of Northern Bulgaria and the region of Sofia became the Principality of Bulgaria while most of the rest of Southern Bulgaria was part of Eastern Rumelia until the Bulgarian unification in 1885.

Ernest Mason

Ernest "Imshi" Mason DFC and Bar (29 July 1913 – 15 February 1942) was a British World War II flying ace, credited with one "Luftwaffe" and 14 "Regia Aeronautica" aircraft destroyed, two shared destroyed, three damaged and another three shared damaged in the air. Mason claimed one and 13 shared destroyed on the ground.
Early life.
Ernest “Imshi” Mason was born in Darlington, and was educated at Blackpool Grammar School. A gifted musician ( he played the saxophone) he was also interested in engineering and mechanics, riding motorcycles in dirt track racing at the age of 14.
RAF career.
Mason joined the RAF in March 1938, undergoing training at 4 FTS in Egypt. He was initially posted to No. 48 squadron flying Vickers Wellesley bombers, but managed to switch to fighters with No. 80 Sqn. flying the Gloster Gladiator by the time the war had started. At the end of 1940 he transferred as part of a flight of 80 Squadron forming into No. 274 Squadron with the Hawker Hurricane.
Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II.
Mason and Lt. Robert Talbot of the SAAF were detached to Sidi Barrani in order to "freelance" over the Libyan Desert attacking targets of opportunity. It was during this period that Mason developed his preferred style of attack, embarking on long range missions to attack enemy air bases well behind the lines. 
By the end of January 1941, Mason’s score was 14 kills and he was awarded the DFC in February 1941. By this time, he was also the leading Allied ace in the Middle East theatre. 
In March 1941, Mason led a flight to Malta to reinforce the defensive fighter force. On 13 April, Mason attacked four Bf 109s. He was attacked in turn by Oblt. Klaus Mietusch of JG 26 and shot down for the German's eighth victory. Mason ditched his aircraft in the sea, suffering wounds to his hand in the combat and a broken nose in the ditching. 
By now Mason has assumed a notoriety within the aircrews of the Commonwealth Air Forces, having grown a thick black beard (against RAF regulations) and acquiring the nickname "Imshi" ; colloquial Arabic for 'scram', which he reportedly tended to shout at the local pedlars. 
Among Mason's notable victims were Tenente Oscar Abello and "Sergente" Pardino Pardini of "70a Squadriglia", "Regia Aeronautica", victims number six and seven, both shot down on the same mission over Greece on 5 January 1941. 
During a patrol on 26 January, Mason encountered three Fiat G.50bis of 2o Gruppo CT near Derna and seven Fiat CR.42s of 368a "Squadriglia" strafing Australian ground positions. 
Mason shot down two victims, Sottotenente Alfonso Nuti and Maresciallo Guido Papparato from 368a Squadriglia, who were both killed. 
In July 1941 Mason assumed command of No. 261 Squadron, reforming in Palestine.In August he led the unit in the occupation of Iran, and in January was posted back to the Western Desert to command No 94 Squadron flying P-40 Kittyhawks.
Death.
On 15 February 1942, Mason led a ground attack mission against a known "Luftwaffe" base at Martuba, Egypt. His flight was bounced by "Jagdgeschwader 27" Messerschmitt Bf 109s led by the German ace "Obfw". Otto Schulz. Four Kittyhawks were shot down, including Mason's. He was killed, becoming Schulz's 40th victim.

Charles Edward Owen Smyth CMG (1 January 1851–1 October 1925) was an Irish-born Australian civil servant.
Owen Smyth was born in Ferrybank, County Kilkenny, the son of a naval architect. He was educated at Erasmus Smith High School, Dublin, and then travelled the world as a sailor and house painter before settling in Australia in 1873. He spent two years as a builder's foreman and manager in Victoria before moving to Adelaide and joining the civil service in May 1876. He was appointed clerk to the architect Edward J. Woods, and remained with him when he was appointed Architect-in-Chief of South Australia in 1878.
In 1886, Owen Smyth was appointed superintendent of the new Works and Buildings Department, which he headed for the rest of his career until his retirement in 1920. He supervised the construction of, among other notable buildings, the Exhibition Building, the Museum and Art Gallery of South Australia, Magill Home, Bedford Park Sanatorium, Thebarton Mounted Police Barracks, the South Australian School of Mines and Industries, and the Torrens Parade Ground.
Owen Smyth was always an ardent imperialist, was active in several imperialist and patriotic organisations, and made sure portraits of the monarch were hung in all notable locations within his buildings. His younger son was killed at Gallipoli during the First World War. Smyth was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours.

Hunter House (Detroit, Michigan)

The Hunter House (also known as the William Northwood House or the Northwood - Hunter House) is located at 3985 Trumbull Avenue in the Woodbridge Neighborhood Historic District of Detroit, Michigan. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974. It is currently operated as the Woodbridge Star, a bed and breakfast.
History.
In 1890, William Northwood, the co-founder of the Howard-Northwood Malt Manufacturing Company, commissioned architect George F. Depew to design this home. The structure was completed in 1891 at a cost of $13,500. In 1903, James J. Sullivan, founder of Sullivan Beef, purchased the home. The family lived in the house until 1957. Both Howard-Northwood Malt Manufacturing and Sullivan Beef were major commercial ventures in Detroit, and this home reflects the prosperity of the owners. In the 1960s, the house was converted into a church, and in 1966, a side porch and conservatory were demolished. In the early 1970s, the home was purchased by the Hunter family, who converted it back to a private residence. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
The home is currently operated as the Woodbridge Star, a seven-room bed and breakfast. Very few exterior alterations have been made to the home, and the interior remains highly original.
Architecture.
George F. Depew designed the elaborate three-story house in French Renaissance Châteauesque style with a red brick and rusticated stone exterior. The influences of Queen Anne and Second Empire styles can also be seen on the home. Round and square towers project from the main section of the house, each with a different roof style. The house has . The sides of the house differe in their appearance. Incised brick and colored sandstone add ornamentation to the façade. The roof has red slate shingles with metal cresting; shingle-covered gables facing the front of the home extend from the roof. The transom windows are filled with stained and leaded glass, and the house boasts polished jasper collonettes.

<doc id="19074264" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19074264" title="Amalgam (chemistry)">
Amalgam (chemistry)

An amalgam is a substance formed by the reaction of mercury with another metal. Almost all metals can form amalgams with mercury, the notable exception being iron. Silver-mercury amalgams are important in dentistry, and gold-mercury amalgam is used in the extraction of gold from ore.
Known amalgams and their uses.
Dental amalgam.
Dentistry has used alloys of mercury with metals such as silver, copper, indium, tin and zinc. Amalgam is an "excellent and versatile restorative material" and is used in dentistry for a number of reasons. It is inexpensive and relatively easy to use and manipulate during placement; it remains soft for a short time so it can be packed to fill any irregular volume, and then forms a hard compound. Amalgam possesses greater longevity when compared to other direct restorative materials, such as composite. However, this difference has decreased with continual development of composite resins.
Amalgam is typically compared to resin-based composites because many applications are similar and many physical properties and costs are comparable.
Potassium amalgam.
For the alkali metals, amalgamation is exothermic, and distinct chemical forms can be identified, such as KHg and KHg2. KHg is a gold-coloured compound with a melting point of 178 °C, and KHg2 a silver-coloured compound with a melting point of 278 °C. These amalgams are very sensitive to air and water, but can be worked with under dry nitrogen. The Hg-Hg distance is around 300 picometres, Hg-K around 358 pm.
Phases K5Hg7 and KHg11 are also known; rubidium, strontium and barium undecamercurides are known and isostructural. Sodium amalgam (NaHg2) has a different structure, with the mercury atoms forming hexagonal layers, and the sodium atoms a linear chain which fits into the holes in the hexagonal layers, but the potassium atom is too large for this structure to work in KHg2.
Sodium amalgam.
Sodium amalgam is produced as a by product of the chloralkali process and used as an important reducing agent in organic and inorganic chemistry. With water it decomposes into concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, hydrogen and mercury, which can then return to the chloralkali process anew. If absolutely water-free alcohol is used instead of water, an alkoxide of sodium is produced instead of the alkali solution.
Ammonium amalgam.
In 1808, an ammonium amalgam was discovered by Humphry Davy and Jöns Jakob Berzelius
It is a grey, soft, spongy mass which decomposes readily at room temperature or in contact with water or alcohol:
It is highly toxic and harmful to the environment.
Aluminium amalgam.
Aluminium amalgam is used as a reducing agent.
Thallium amalgam.
Thallium amalgam has a freezing point of −58 °C, lower than mercury's, and so has found a use in low temperature thermometers.
Tin amalgam.
Tin amalgam was used in the middle of the 19th century as a reflective mirror coating.
Use in mining.
Mercury has been used in gold and silver mining because of the convenience and the ease with which mercury and the precious metals will amalgamate. In gold placer mining, in which minute specks of gold are washed from sand or gravel deposits, mercury was often used to separate the gold from other heavy minerals.
After all of the practical metal had been taken out from the ore, the mercury was dispensed down a long copper trough, which formed a thin coating of mercury on the exterior. The waste ore was then transferred down the trough, and gold in the waste amalgamated with the mercury. This coating would then be scraped off and refined by evaporation to get rid of the mercury, leaving behind somewhat high purity gold.
Mercury amalgamation was first used on silver ores with the development of the patio process in Mexico in 1557. There were also additional amalgamation processes that were created for processing silver ores, including pan amalgamation and the Washoe process.
Gold amalgam.
Produced when mercury is used for gold extraction.
Gold extraction (mining).
This has proved effective where gold fines ("flour gold") would not be extractable from ore using hydro-mechanical methods. Large amounts of mercury were used in "placer mining", where deposits composed largely of decomposed granite slurry were separated in long runs of "riffle boxes", with mercury dumped in at the head of the run. The amalgam formed is a heavy solid mass of dull gray color. (The use of mercury in 19th century placer mining in California, now prohibited, has caused extensive pollution problems in riverine and estuarine environments, ongoing to this day.) Sometimes substantial slugs of amalgam are found in downstream river and creek bottoms by amateur wet-suited miners seeking gold nuggets with the aid of an engine-powered water vacuum mounted on a float.
Gold extraction (ore processing).
Where stamp mills were used to crush gold-bearing ore to fines, a part of the extraction process involved the use of mercury-wetted copper plates, over which the crushed fines were washed. A periodic scraping and re-mercurizing of the plate resulted in amalgam for further processing.
Gold extraction (retorting).
Amalgam obtained by either process was then heated in a distillation retort, recovering the mercury for reuse and leaving behind the gold. As this released mercury vapors to the atmosphere, the process could induce adverse health effects and long term pollution.
Today, mercury amalgamation has been replaced by other methods to recuperate gold and silver from ore in developed nations. Hazards of mercurial toxic waste have played a major role in the phasing out of the mercury amalgamation processes. However mercury amalgamation is still regularly used by small-scale gold placer miners (often illegally) & particularly in developing countries.
Amalgam probe.
Mercury salts are, compared to mercury metal and amalgam, highly toxic due to their solubility in water. The presence of these salts in water can be detected with a probe that uses the readiness of mercury ions to form an amalgam with copper. A nitric acid solution of salts under investigation is applied to a piece of copper foil, and any mercury ions present will leave spots of silvery-coloured amalgam. Silver ions leave similar spots but are easily washed away, making this a means of distinguishing silver from mercury.
The redox reaction involved where mercury oxidizes the copper is:
Mercury does not form amalgam with iron, platinum, tungsten or tantalum.
