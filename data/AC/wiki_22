Lac d'Aiguebelette

Lac d'Aiguebelette is a natural lake in the Savoie department of France.
Description.
With a surface area of 5.45 km2, it is one of the largest natural lakes of France. Small towns as Novalaise, Lepin-Le-Lac, St. Alban de Montbel and Aiguebelette-le-lac are located along the lake. The lake is bordered by the Chaîne de l'Épine ridge to the east, with its high point at Mont Grelle (). The ridge is crossed by various hiking trails, and paragliders launch regularly from the Col de l'Épine during the summer. The lake distinguishes itself by its blue-green color. The lake is extraordinary by the 7 hot water wells that make the temperature of the water pleasant in summertime. There are also some camping sites along the lake and privately owned waterhouses. There are games organised for different camp sites to compete and the usual fireworks in summertime to celebrate the beginning of the French summer break. In the south of the lake there are two islands, Le Grand Ile and Le Petit Ile. A chapel has been built on the big island and archaeologists found prehistoric materials there. The deepest point in the lake is 71 meters. Motorboats are not allowed on the lake to preserve the silence and wildlife along the lake. There are breathtaking views of the lake from the church at St. Alban de Montbel, mountain ridges and the higher located countryside, a bit north of the road around the lake.
The lake hosted the 1997 World Rowing Championships, and has been selected as the venue for the 2015 competition.

Astrakhan-Caspian Military Flotilla

The Astrakhan-Caspian Military Flotilla () was formed by the Bolsheviks in October 1918 for the purpose of defending the Lower Volga and northern parts of the Caspian Sea from the Volunteer Army. The existing flotilla, the so-called Military Fleet of the Astrakhan Krai had been operating in this region since April 1918 and consisted of 50 combat ships and 6 hydroplanes. It was reinforced by torpedo boats and submarines from Kronstadt in the fall of that year. 
In December 1918, the flotilla was transferred under the command of the Caucasus-Caspian Front. In the early 1919, most of the Caspian Sea was under the control of the White Army and Allied intervention (21 armed steamships and 13 torpedo boats). In May 1919, the Astrakhan-Caspian Military Flotilla stormed ashore, captured a fort named Alexandrovsk, and then seized the "Leila" steamship, which carried General Anton Denikin's envoy General Alexei Grishin-Almazov (he was en route to Guryev to meet with Aleksandr Kolchak). In May–June 1919, the Astrakhan-Caspian Military Flotilla provided fire support to the units of the 10th and 11th Armies during the Tsaritsyn and Astrakhan defense. By this time, the flotilla had already had 3 cruisers (armed schooners), 6 destroyers, 3 torpedo boats, 4 submarines, 10 armed steamships, 7 fighters, 4 floating batteries etc. 
On July 31 of 1919, the Astrakhan-Caspian Military Flotilla was merged with the Volga Military Flotilla to form the Volga-Caspian Military Flotilla.

Couesnophone

The couesnophone, also known as the goofus or queenophone, is a free-reed musical instrument resembling a saxophone. Its reeds vibrate when the desired keys are activated and the player blows through a tube. French manufacturer Couesnon was awarded the patent no. 569294 in 1924 for an instrument that was described as a "saxophone jouet" (fr. "toy saxophone"). However, the couesnophone is a polyphonic instrument, while the saxophone is monophonic.
Playing the couesnophone.
The couesnophone may be held like a saxophone or like a melodica (horizontally), given that the mouthpiece consists of a rubber tube that allows both positions. The keys are set in a layout similar to that of the Hohner early (proper – see [http://www.patmissin.com/history/melodica.html]) melodicas, i.e. in two parallel rows: one corresponds to the white keys of a piano keyboard, while the other comprises the black keys.
Performers.
The couesnophone was introduced in jazz music by bass saxophonist and vibraphonist Adrian Rollini. The term "goofus" might have been coined by jazz musicians.

Caryn Davies

Caryn Davies (born 14 April 1982) is an American rower. She won gold medals as the stroke seat in women's eight at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2012 Davies was ranked number 4 in the world by the International Rowing Federation. At the 2004 Olympic Games she won a silver medal in the women's eight. Davies has won more Olympic medals than any other U.S. oarswoman. The 2008 U.S. women's eight, of which she was a part, was named FISA (International Rowing Federation) crew of the year. Davies is from Ithaca, New York, where she graduated from Ithaca High School, and rowed with the Cascadilla Boat Club. Davies was on the Radcliffe College (Harvard) Crew Team and was a member on Radcliffe's 2003 NCAA champion Varsity 8, and overall team champion. In 2013 she was a visiting student at Pembroke College, Oxford where she stroked the college men's eight to a victory in both Torpids (spring intercollegiate races) and the Oxford University Summer Eights races (for the first time in Oxford rowing history). In 2013 she was inducted into the New York Athletic Club Hall of Fame. She is a Vice President of the U.S. Olympians Association and athletes' representative to the Board of USRowing.
Davies has a degree from Harvard University (A.B. Psychology, 2005) and a J.D. (Doctor of Law) from Columbia Law School (2013). Davies is the most decorated Harvard Olympian in any sport. During 2013-2014 Davies is serving as a clerk to Judge Richard Clifton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Early career.
Davies was recruited into rowing at 12 years of age. She started rowing competitively a year later in Australia in 1996, at the Friend’s School in Hobart. A local rowing club also recruited her into single sculling, where groups of teenagers launched off a beach into tidal estuarine waters. Within six months she was the Tasmanian under-15 single sculls champion. Returning from Australia she continued with Cascadilla Boat Club and the Ithaca High School rowing team. In 1998, as a 16 year-old she competed in the world’s biggest rowing race, the Head of the Charles in Boston. Because she had already placed in the top three in a junior race at the Canadian Henley the summer before the race, officials insisted in placing her, as the only junior, into the championship category of top senior international rowers; she put up a creditable performance by placing 16th. The following summer (1999) she made her first national team, coming second in the US junior eight in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, followed by a gold medal in a four at the junior world championships in Zagreb, Croatia in 2000, the first gold medal ever by US Junior women. She also won the prestigious Stotesbury cup regatta and the Scholastic Rowing Association single sculls in both 1999 and 2000, and the USRowing Youth invitational in 2000, placing her as the top US junior female rower at the time she left high school. Caryn's brother Kenneth also represented the USA as a junior rower, and well as rowing at Cornell University, achieving the position of Commodore of the Cornell Crew in his senior year and receiving All Ivy Academic Honors for all four years.
College and world championships.
Davies rowed for Harvard from 2001-2003, leading the team to an NCAA championship in 2003, and again in 2005, after taking a year off for the Olympics. She has again taken a year off from Columbia Law School to compete in 2012. Most National Team training has been based in Princeton, New Jersey, where the US women’s team shares a boathouse and a lake with Princeton University, whereas winter training was based in San Diego.
Davies has the ability to row starboard, port, or scull at an international level. At 6' 4" she is the tallest member of the U.S. Women's National Team. She was part of the U.S. Olympic women's eight that set a world record in the heat prior to a silver medal in the final in Athens, Greece. She was stroking the eight that repeated the feat in the World Cup in Lucerne in May 2012. As the most experienced oarsperson on the U.S. women's team she acts as a guiding figure: "Remember it's just like the World Championships - the same people doing the same thing - but with more flags."
Davies has twice won the C.R.A.S.H-Bs, the World Indoor Rowing Championship, one of the world's most grueling competitions, first as a junior in 2000, and then in the collegiate women open category in 2005. She serves as the athlete demonstrating rowing technique in video for the Concept II rowing-machine. Davies also promotes youth fitness through World Fit and gives inspirational talks to youth groups.
Davies’ hobbies include travel, sailing, downhill skiing, horseback riding, yoga, and ballroom dancing. In high school she competed for several years in competitive downhill skiing, reaching a 7th place in giant slalom in New York State. As a senior at Harvard, she competed on the ballroom team.

Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard (Broodthaers)

"Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard" ("A Throw of the Dice will Never Abolish Chance") is an artist's book by Marcel Broodthaers published November 1969 in Antwerp. The work is a close copy of the first edition of the French Symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé's poem of the same name, published in 1914, but with all the words removed, replaced by black stripes that correspond directly to the typographic layout used by Mallarmé to articulate the text.
"Broodthaers reduces Un Coup de Dés to its structure - or to put it another way he elevates the structure of the work to a concept worthy of study in its own right, thus acknowledging Mallarmé's own fetishistic attention to this aspect of his work. Rendering the structure concrete, visible, almost tactile, Broodthaers offers a conceptual analysis of Mallarmé's poem across the distance of a nearly a century...It would be hard to imagine a more subtle treatment of Mallarmé's work, or one more capable of demonstrating its essential properties, than this reworked book by Broodthaers." Johanna Drucker
Often included in exhibitions tracing the history of the artist's book, the work is seen as a seminal example of the European post-avant-garde. It is often referred to simply as "Un Coup de Dés".
Concrete Poetry.
Mallarmé and Magritte.
Broodthaers had lived in poverty as a poet in Brussels for twenty years before becoming an artist in 1964. His first exhibition, at the Galere Saint-Laurent, included two unsold parcels of his fourth book of poetry, "Pense-Bête", encased in plaster. This was the first of many works that 'employed techniques associated with poetry but applied by him not only to words but to images and symbols.' "Un Coup de Dés" would become the most famous instance of Broodthaers' interest in setting up a contradiction between the written word and a visual image 'to the profit of the subject.'
Broodthaers had been given a copy of Mallarmé's "Un Coup de Dés" in 1945 by the Belgian surrealist painter Réné Magritte as 'a way of explaining his art to a young admirer without explaining it literally.'
"As for the idea of establishing a direct relationship between literature and the plastic arts, I'm afraid I have done so by taking as a subject "A Throw Of The Dice", by Mallarmé !!!" Broodthaers
Mallarmé had written the poem in 1897 and left copious notes as to how it should be typeset, instructions that were finally carried out 16 years after his death, in 1914. The poem was famous for its extraordinary typography, which anticipated the 20th century interest in graphic design and concrete poetry. Mallarmé was known to have organised the layout of the poem using rectangles of card, and to leave written pleas to publish the work exactly as he'd intended. As such, Broodthaers' work can be seen as a direct quote of Mallarmé's working methods and of his obsession with the visual layout of the text.
“Mallarmé is the source of all contemporary art... it unconsciously invents modern space”. Broodthaers 1970
The Literary Exhibition.
Broodthaers' exhibition 'Exposition Littéraire autour de Mallarmé' at the Wide White Space Gallery, Antwerp, December 1969 consisted of a copy of Mallarmé's book 'opened so that, (as nearly always when a book is put in an exhibition) only two pages were visible. The meaning is there but cannot be entirely reached.' A series of metal plates, made of anodised aluminium, engraved with black impressions standing in for the text, were hung on the wall whilst a recording of Broodthaers reciting the poem was played continuously for the duration of the exhibition. 
'The word was 'there', more 'real', because three dimensional, than the original pages but, of course, negative and illegible. Meanwhile, the tape-recorded voice of the artist read out the poem repeatedly, it was 'there' but not simultaneously and continuously present like the words of the poem.'
The book.
After a brief introduction citing the original edition published in 1914 by Librairie Gallimard, the book starts with the entire poem written as a block of text with each line separated by a slash (/). 12 double spreads follow, with immaculately laid out black rectangles standing in for the text. The work is soft bound and feels quite insubstantial. The cover is a near-perfect facsimile of the original cover, but with the word 'image' replacing 'poem' in the centre of the design.
The edition was published in Antwerp to coincide with the exhibition on 25 November 1969. 10 copies of the work - unbound, numbered I-X, printed onto 12 aluminium sheets - were made available, along with 90 copies printed on translucent paper and 300 copies on normal paper. The translucent edition came with two sheets of white card cut to the size of the book so that individual pages could be isolated by the reader if they so wished.
Reception of the book.
The book, like Broodthaers' work in general, has gradually grown in stature since his death in 1976, and has found its way into a number of important collections, including MOMA, V&A, and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp.
It also has inspired other reworks, like this one by Michalis Pichler: "In Michalis Pichlers’ 2008 rework the blocks are cut out, creating a negative space and geometric pattern of cuts and absence. (...) The idea of remake and of version, using another existing work as point of departure, relieves the artist of the onus of originality while allowing the new gesture to stand as a novel gesture. Un-originality, anti-expressiveness – these are terms that are of more recent vintage than first generation conceptualism."

The Camerawalls

The Camerawalls is an indie pop band based in Manila, Philippines formed in 2007 by singer and guitarist Clementine, the main songwriter of the band and formerly of Orange and Lemons.
History.
With a cult following back in 2003 to mainstream success in 2005 via a series of hit singles through a major label, it was with the band Orange and Lemons that the breakup in 2007 resulted in the premature exit of Clementine from the music scene.
This was to prove as only temporary, as Clementine immediately formed a new band in September 2007 under the name The Camerawalls. It showcased his songwriting prowess that manifested in his earlier works collaborating with old friends Law Santiago and Ian Sarabia.
To support The Camerawalls' releases and go as far as establishing full creative control and marketing his own music, Clementine also founded Lilystars Records, an independent record label determined to house the sensibility and aesthetics of indie pop music in the Philippines.
On March 2008, The Camerawalls released a sample of their music with an unofficial single "Markers Of Beautiful Memories" over the internet, which slowly gained attention and a following and then eventually picked up by radio. With the release of the debut album "Pocket Guide to the Otherworld" on July 3, 2008 and the success of the single "Clinically Dead For 16 Hours", The Camerawalls became an example of a remarkable music production in true indie spirit.
"Pocket Guide to the Otherworld" has become a landmark release that showed people what happens when contemporary indie pop meets good old Filipino sensibilities.
New Single and line-up changes.
The Camerawalls acquired Paolo Peralta as their session guitarist in November 2009 and later as an official member as they continue to tour.
On February 22, 2010, The Camerawalls released a digital single called "The Sight of Love". The new single marks an official return to the recording studios. "The Sight of Love" also features another artist from the Lilystars stable – vocalist Sarah Gaugler of electro-pop band Turbo Goth.
Two months after its release, Paolo Peralta and Ian Sarabia resigned from the band. Currently, Clementine and Law Santiago are working on The Camerawall's upcoming new album.
Musical styles.
The Camerawalls is renowned for incorporating native rondalla (traditional Philippine folk music) instrumentations in their recordings attributed to Clementine's exposure to his father's work as a Rondalla instructor. Prominent sections of banduria and octavina can be heard on a number of songs especially on their remake of "Canto De Maria Clara", a Spanish poem written by Filipino writer and national hero José Rizal which appeared on the novel "Noli Me Tangere" (first published in 1887 in Berlin).
Some of the band's influences includes The Beatles, Morrissey, The Smiths, XTC, Belle & Sebastian, Trash Can Sinatras, The Pale Fountains, Terry Hall, and The Lightning Seeds.

He was the first Washingtonian teacher ever to be inducted into the National Teachers Hall of Fame. He has spent the majority of his career at Lynden Christian High School. Kredit is also a ranger at Yellowstone Park in Wyoming during the summer and a prolific photographer for the National Park Service.
Kredit has gained renown for his "investigative" approach to teaching secondary biology and emphasis on leadership, and for his efforts in fish and wildlife conservation, particularly along Whatcom County's Fishtrap Creek (which eventually dispenses into Puget Sound). His students know him for his familiar exclamation of "It's a great day to be alive!"
History and work.
Harlan Kredit was born and raised in Lynden, Washington, alongside Fishtrap Creek, which contained "huge numbers of salmon each fall."
Kredit graduated from Calvin College in 1961 and taught high school science education in Hudsonville, Michigan from 1962 to 1972. In 1967 he gained a master's degree in Science Teaching from the College of William and Mary.

Upon his return to Whatcom County, he discovered that Fishtrap Creek had "hardly any fish left." He began a salmon restoration project in 1976 which continues to this day, hatching over 2 million salmon since its foundation.
In 1980 he earned a degree as an Emergency Medical Technician from Calvin. In 1986, he also began teaching environmental education to teachers at the American Wilderness Leadership School in Jackson, Wyoming. He has continued his education at Western Washington University, Michigan State University, Idaho State University, and the University of Wyoming.
Projects worked on in Kredit's classes include raising 50,000 Coho salmon at the Lynden Christian Fish Hatchery every year, treeplanting (over 18,000 as of 2007), restoration, and litter disposal around Whatcom County, raising awareness of contaminating river drainage, channeling Fishtrap Creek for the safety of salmon, and mapping Whatcom's drainage basin.
In addition, Kredit served as Lynden Christian's athletic director and sat as a WIAA Executive Board Representative of the Northwest Interscholastic Activities Association. Kredit's hobbies include beekeeping, mountaineering, and repairing Ford Model T's and player pianos.
Kredit is a member of the National Science Teachers Association, the Washington State Science Teachers Association, and the Nature Conservancy.
Honors and awards.
Kredit has also twice been awarded the Department of the Interior's Special Achievement Award for his work as a ranger at Yellowstone Park. All in all, Kredit has won at least 25 awards and honors for his work in conservation ecology and secondary education.

Liulichang

The Liulichang () is a famous district in down-town Beijing that is known for a series of traditional Chinese stone dwellings housing selling various craftwork, artistry, and antiques. It is one of Beijing's traditional old quarters.
History.
Its name "liulichang" came from during the time of Ming Dynasty when a renowned colored glaze factory (Liuli Chang in Chinese) was in production in the street, which made glazed tiles for the palaces, temples and residences of the officials.
According to local legend, during the Ming and Qing era, Liulichang was a favorite haunt for scholars, painters and calligraphers who gathered there to write, compile and purchase books, as well as to paint and compose poetry, and by the Kangxi period (1661-1722), Liulichang had become one of the most flourishing cultural centers in all of Beijing.
Renovations.
Large scale renovations in modern time have transformed this place into an antique market that resembles a Chinese village. The many shops located on the street are filled with a variety of Chinese folk arts such paintings, calligraphy, pottery, carpets, vases, books, scrolls and chops. 
Today the street is a mixture of state-run and privately owned shops and customers are recommended by shop owners to bargain before making purchases. There are also traditional teahouses and wineshops, as well as many restaurants.
It is a popular destination for tourists who wish to experience the commercial aspect of popular Chinese folk artwork in Beijing without the bustling traffic.

Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie or KKS was a municipal owned company that operated parts of the Oslo Tramway from 1899 to 1905. It had 20 tramcars that served the three branch lines Rodeløkka Line, Vippetangen Line and Sagene Ring. The company was sold to Kristiania Sporveisselskab after it failed to make a profit.
History.
Kristiania (now Oslo) got its first tramway, Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS) in 1874, followed by Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES) in 1894. Both these companies were making good money, so the city council decided to also start a service—the first municipal owned tram operator in Norway. The first line opened on 24 November 1899 when they opened their tracks from Sagene to Aker Street (the Sagene Ring), connecting onwards to the Eastern Railway Station (Østbanen) using KES tracks. On 26 January 1901 a connection line was built from Tollbu Street to Kirkeristen to avoid running on KES tracks.
The second line was opened on 27 March 1900 from Nybrua via Trondheim Street to Rodeløkka (the Rodeløkka Line, parts that have become the Sinsen Line). From Nybrua to the city center KSS track was used. The depot was located at Rodeløkka. The third line opened on 28 August 1900 from Tollbu Street to Festningsbryggen at Vippetangen—the Vippetangen Line. Again KSS track was needed to connect the line into the city core. Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch with electric components delivered from Schuk. There were all long with 50 kW effect. The cars weighed 9.3 tonnes while the trailers weighed 6.4 tonnes. They remained in service until 1967.
The company had three operating lines:
The company failed to make any profits, and in 1905 it was sold to KSS. The municipality returned as a tram operator in 1924 when the concession for KSS and KES expired, and they were both merged into the municipal owned Oslo Sporveier.

<doc id="18901060" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18901060" title="Household plot">
Household plot

Household plot is a legally defined farm type in all former socialist countries in CIS and CEE. This is a small plot of land (typically less than 0.5 hectares) attached to a rural residence. The household plot is primarily cultivated for subsistence and its traditional purpose since the Soviet times has been to provide the family with food. Surplus products from the household plot are sold to neighbors, relatives, and often also in farmer markets in nearby towns. The household plot was the only form of private or family farming allowed during the Soviet era, when household plots of rural people coexisted in a symbiotic relationship with large collective and state farms. Since 1990, the household plots are classified as one of the two components of the individual farm sector, the other being peasant farms – independent family farms established for commercial production on much larger areas of agricultural land (typically 10-50 hectares). In terms of legal organization, household plots are natural (physical) persons, whereas peasant farms generally are legal (juridical) persons.
Names.
Household plots are called in Russian subsidiary (or auxiliary) household plots – личные подсобные хозяйства, abbreviated in writing and in speech as ЛПХ (transliteration: LPKh). They are also often referred to (especially in official statistical publications) as хозяйства населения (), i.e., plots (or farms) of rural residents (where the term “rural residents” is used to distinguish them from peasant farmers). This Russian terminology was universally accepted in all former Soviet countries until the early 1990s, but a certain terminological divergence has since emerged in the newly independent states. For instance, in Uzbekistan the traditional household plots are now called dehkan farms and in Ukraine the Russian abbreviation ЛПХ has been replaced with OСГ (from Ukrainian: "osobysti selyanski hospodarstva").
History.
In Czarist Russia, the plot ("usad'ba") was usually adjacent to the peasant's house. Here the peasants traditionally grew vegetables, hemp (a source of oil and livestock feed) and a little fruit. Gardens varied in size; they could be as much as a hectare, but most were smaller. The plot was normally in the hereditary tenure of the household, and not subject to repartition (unlike the peasants' holdings in the open fields).
In the later 19th century the growth of towns and cities in central Russia encouraged the development of market gardening and truck farming in this region. By the eve of the Revolution the garden economy was developing quickly. A further stimulus was provided in the first years of the Revolution by the Bolshevik policy of requisitioning peasant produce. Fruit and vegetables were exempt from this policy, and this resulted in a strong swing from grain farming to kitchen and market gardening. In the grain-producing regions (Black-Earth belt and North Caucasia) the garden economy increased its share of peasant commodity production from 3.3% in 1913 to 12.2% in 1920, while the field economy declined from 62.6% to 39.3% in the same period. Market gardening continued to develop during the 1920s.
The mass collectivization decree of January 1930 made no mention of garden plots, and in many areas the local Communist authorities abolished them. But in March 1930, after the chaos and peasant resistance engendered by the all-out drive, the right of the peasant to have a personal plot was recognised. No maximum size was agreed at this stage, however, and the garden plot remained in a legislative limbo until the kolkhoz model charter of February 1935.
This charter specified that plots could vary from one-quarter to one-half hectare, and up to 1 hectare in special districts. The legislation regarded individual peasants as the holders but in practice plots were still in household tenure. The private plots were responsible for a significant fraction of agricultural production, and provided the peasants with a large part of their food and income. In 1938 they accounted for 21.5% of agricultural produce. The average peasant household earned about twice as much from marketings from the private plot as from its work on collective land.
By the late 1930s market gardening, with the private plot as its base, was perhaps becoming the dominant part of agriculture in the Black-Sea hinterland and the truck-gardening areas around big cities like Moscow and Leningrad. The government, alarmed by this `resurgence of private capitalism', passed legislation to contain it in 1939, but it continued to play an important role in agriculture.

Dai Dower

David William "Dai" Dower MBE (born 20 June 1933), former British, Empire and European Flyweight boxing champion, is one of the most successful Welsh boxers of all time.
Amateur career.
After becoming ABA Flyweight Champion Dower was selected for the team of Great Britain at the 1952 Summer Olympics in the boxing squad, recording victories over Abdelamid Boutefnouchet of France (3-0) and Leslie Donovan Perera Handunge of Ceylon (3-0) before finally losing to Russian boxer Anatoly Bulakov, the holder of the Russian and European titles, 1-2.
Professional career.
In 1953 Dower turned professional and in he made his professional debut at Maindy Arena in Cardiff against Vernon John. Dower won by technical knockout. Dower then beat Ron Hughes in two rounds before he was taken the distance for the first time, opposing the vastly more experienced Preston fighter Colin Clitheroe. Clitheroe had lost three of twenty two fights, mostly at bantamweight, but lost to Dower by points in a six round bout. With another four wins to his name, including two over Jimmy Roche, Dower faced Clitheroe again, this time stopping him in round five.
On 23 March 1954, with 14 straight professional wins, Dower faced current British Flyweight Champion Terry Allen in a non-title fight. Scheduled for a ten round fight at Earls Court Arena in London, Dower stopped Allen in the second.
With 20 successful bouts as a professional boxer under his belt Dower was given his first chance at a title fight. On 19 October 1954 the diminutive Welshman became British Empire Champion, taking the title away from South African Zulu boxer Jake Tuli. 
A second chance of a title came in 1955 in the shape of the British flyweight crown. Terry Allen, a previous Dower victim, had vacated the title allowing Dai Dower to contest the crown against Eric Marsden on 8 March at the Harringay Arena. Also at stake was Dower's Empire crown. Dower beat Marsden by points over the 15 round contest. 
Still unbeaten after 23 fights, the next title came just five months later when Dower took on Nazzareno Gianelli for the European Flyweight title at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London. Boxing brilliantly Dower dazzled the watching crowd with a wonderful display of text book left jabbing. The fight went the distance with Dower winning on points. 
His first defeat came in his defence of the newly attained European crown, his 27th fight. Young Martin, a Spaniard, began to get through to the champion with his forceful and hurtful body attacks. Dower was dropped in the ninth round for the first time in the flyweight's career. Worse was to follow with the champ hitting the canvas no less than six times in the tenth. It was all over in the twelfth round when Martin dropped the Welshman for the full count.
Five wins out of five followed in 1956, restoring Dower's career on its upward path. Later in the year Dower took a break from the ring when he joined the army to do his two years National Service. 
On 30 March 1957 Dower fought World Flyweight Champion Pascual Perez who was at the height of his powers at Club Atletico San Lorenzo de Almagro, in Perez' home town of Buenos Aires The fight proved to be a bout too far, and Dower suffered a first round defeat. 
Dai Dower went back to the British Army to finish his National Service; following the crushing world title defeat. He later vacated his British & Empire flyweight titles.
There was just one more win over Eric Brett before a final defeat against Canadian, Pat Supple in the tenth round. Dower's relatively short, but successful career was over.
Later life.
Shortly before his final fight he took up the position of sports master at Ringwood Grammar School in Bournemouth. He became head of sport at Bournemouth University, a position he held for twenty one years, and in June 1998 he became the recipient of an MBE, awarded for his years of teaching sport to children. Dai Dower now lives in retirement in Bournemouth.

Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad

Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad (born March 15, 1985 in Reims) is a French middle-distance runner who mainly competes in the 3000 metres steeplechase. He has won medals in major international competitions such as the Olympic Games, World Championships, European Championships and European Indoor Championships.
He is of Algerian origin. Mekhissi-Benabbad is best known for his bad temper and violent behavior after events.
Running career.
Mekhissi-Benabbad made his first appearances as a junior athlete in 2004, running at the 2004 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where he was 61st in the junior race, and at the 2004 World Junior Championships where he was eliminated in the heats of the 3000 m steeplechase. He ran in the 1500 metres event at the 2006 European Cup, where he finished eighth. Mekhissi-Benabbad represented France at the 2006 IAAF World Cup, but only managed to finish eighth in the 1500 m event.
Mekhissi-Benabbad won the 3000 metres steeplechase gold medal at the 2007 European Athletics U23 Championships. He competed in his first major senior event later that year – the 2007 World Championships - where he was eliminated in the heats of the 3000 metres steeplechase competition. 
Mekhissi-Benabbad made significant progress in 2008, knocking seconds off his personal best at the 2008 Olympics to win the Olympic 3000 metres steeplechase silver medal in a time of 8:10.49, only 15 hundredths of a second behind the gold medallist Brimin Kipruto. He became the first non-Kenyan in 24 years to finish first or second in the Olympic 3000 metres steeplechase event. Coincidentally, the last non-Kenyan to do so was a Frenchman - Joseph Mahmoud - who won the silver medal at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Mekhissi-Benabbad improved further at the 2008 Weltklasse Zürich meeting, finishing behind Paul Kipsiele Koech in second place in a personal best time of 8:08.95, making him the fourth fastest 3000 metres steeplechaser that year.
Mekhissi-Benabbad opened the 2009 season with an appearance in the 3000 metres event at the Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix, where he registered a personal best of 7:53.50. Another best came in the 3000 metres steeplechase at the FBK Games in Hengelo, again behind Brimin Kipruto, as he took second place in 8:06:98. Mekhissi-Benabbad secured a prominent 2009 IAAF Golden League race victory at the Meeting Areva in Paris with a time of 8:13.23. He was selected to represent France at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, where he was seen as a possible medallist in the 3000 metres steeplechase. But he failed to complete his heat in that event when he was forced to step off the track injured with just over a lap to go. 
Mekhissi-Benabbad took part in the 2010 World Indoor Championships, his first major indoor competition, where he reached the final of the 1500 m and finished in eighth position with a time of 3:45.22. During the outdoor season of 2010, he scored a steeplechase win in 8:08.82 over Ezekiel Kemboi and Richard Mateelong at the Meeting International Mohammed VI d'Athlétisme de Rabat. Competing in the Reims leg of the French Alma Athlé Tour on 30 June 2010, he beat Bouabdellah Tahri's world's fastest time of 2010 of 5:13.47 in the 2000 m steeplechase. Mekhissi-Benabbad's new world record time of 5:10.68 in that 2000 m steeplechase race bettered the previous world record set 20 years ago by Julius Kariuki. 
Mekhissi-Benabbad won his second consecutive 3000 metres steeplechase Olympic silver medal at the 2012 Olympics in London. In the final, with 200 metres in the race remaining, Ezekiel Kemboi was in the lead, followed by Abel Kiprop Mutai in second place, Roba Gari in third place and Mekhissi-Benabbad in fourth place. Mekhissi-Benabbad then swept past both Gari and Mutai to finish second behind Kemboi. "I want to congratulate Ezekiel Kemboi because he won and it is not by chance because he won in 2004. ... He is stronger than me, but I do hope one day I can beat him," Mekhissi-Benabbad said right after the race. 
On 6 July 2013, Mekhissi-Benabbad set a new 3000 metres steeplechase European outdoor record of 8:00.09 in the 3000 metres steeplechase race at the Meeting Areva held in the Stade de France. He beat the previous European outdoor record of 8:01.18 set in Berlin at the 2009 World Championships by his compatriot Bouabdellah Tahri. Mekhissi-Benabbad finished second in that Meeting Areva 3000 metres steeplechase race, which was won by Ezekiel Kemboi in the world's best time of the year (7:59.03). 
Mekhissi-Benabbad won his second consecutive 3000 metres steeplechase World Championships bronze medal at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow. With about 300 metres to go in the final, Mekhissi-Benabbad passed Ezekiel Kemboi, then Paul Kipsiele Koech and became jointly in the lead with Conseslus Kipruto. Just after clearing the third-last hurdle in the final bend, Kemboi saw his chance and surged forward to pass both Mekhissi-Benabbad and Kipruto. From then on, Kemboi never relinquished his lead. Kipruto overtook Mekhissi-Benabbad at the start of the final straight and eventually finished second behind Kemboi. Right after the race, Mekhissi-Benabbad admitted that he was finding it hard to cope with the pressure. "In the French team I am under a lot of stress and pressure, but I have to deal with it the best I can. ... I had to settle for bronze again but it is never easy to win one. I am on the podium and that is what counts."
Mascot-pushing incidents.
On July 1, 2012, the Finnish newspaper Karjalainen reported an incident involving Mekhissi-Benabbad at the 2012 European Championships in Helsinki. After winning the 3000 meter steeplechase final, Mekhissi-Benabbad walked over to the championship's mascot “Appy”, which was being worn by a 14-year-old girl, smacked a gift bag out of her hands and pushed her with both hands. That was not the first time that Mekhissi-Benabbad had abused a mascot. After having won the same race at the 2010 European Championships championships in Barcelona, Mekhissi-Benabbad asked a mascot to kneel in front of him before he pushed it to the ground. 
Fight with Mehdi Baala.
On 22 July 2011, immediately after the 1500m race of the Monaco meeting of the IAAF Diamond League, Mekhissi-Benabbad and his fellow competitor and compatriot Mehdi Baala traded blows on the track. The French Athletics Federation handed Mekhissi-Benabbad and Baala a suspension of 10 months each - 5 months suspended - from all European Athletics and IAAF track meets. Both were each fined 1500 euros and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service. Mekhissi-Benabbad and Baala were nevertheless cleared to take part in the upcoming 2011 World Championships.

There are two universities in Hiroo. The prestigious University of the Sacred Heart, its predecessor Sacred Heart Koto Senmon School established in 1916 and reorganized into a university with the current name in 1948, is one of the oldest women's universities in Japan. Its important alumnae include the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata and Empress of Japan Michiko. The Japanese Red Cross College of Nursing owns one of its two campuses in Hiroo. Although reorganized into a four-year college recently in 1986, the origin of the nursing school dates back to 1890, when nursing education was launched at the Japanese Red Cross Hospital.
Hiroo is also home to the International School of the Sacred Heart which was founded in 1908 and is located on the same grounds as the University of the Sacred Heart (Seishin Joshi Daigaku). It offers education in English for girls from the ages of three to eighteen. The university offers education to women in Japanese. There are several Japanese schools in the area as well, including Hiroo Senior High School ("Hiroo Kōtōgakkō") and Hiroo Elementary School ("Hiroo Shōgakkō"). The Rainbow International Montessori School also has a facility located in the same area.
Attractions.
Adjacent to Hiroo, the district of Minami-Azabu is home to Arisugawa Park, which spans through a large chunk of the town. The park consists of several paths and walkways, a baseball field, soccer field, children's amusement areas and a man-made waterfall that empties into a pond full of koi and ducks. The park is situated in the close vicinity of Hiro-o Station, causing it to be often incorrectly regarded as "a park in Hiroo."

Rafael Pereira da Silva (footballer born 1990)

Rafael Pereira da Silva (born 9 July 1990), commonly known as Rafael or Rafael da Silva, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Manchester United. He normally plays as a right-back, but can also play on the right side of midfield. He and his twin brother, Fábio, both joined Manchester United from Fluminense in January 2007.
Rafael has two caps for Brazil, having made his debut in a 3–1 victory over Denmark on 26 May 2012. He has also played for Brazil at under-17 level and was part of the silver medal-winning under-23 side at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Early life.
Rafael was born in Petrópolis, approximately one hour's drive away from Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro state, and began playing football from the age of five. He began his career with amateur side Boa Esperança, playing as a striker. He and his identical twin, Fábio, were then spotted by a representative of Fluminense playing five-a-side in their neighbourhood; he invited them to join the club and they began living there when they were 11 years old.
Club career.
Fluminense.
Upon joining Fluminense, Rafael was converted to play at full-back by the youth team coach. The club then took part in the 2005 Nike Premier Cup in Hong Kong, where Rafael was spotted by Manchester United scout Les Kershaw, who remarked that the twins reminded him of "two little whippets". Kershaw then telephoned Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and recommended that the club sign the Da Silva twins. Manchester United got in touch with Fluminense and asked permission for the twins to travel to Manchester to train with them in 2005. Shortly afterwards, a scout claiming to represent Arsenal visited the twins and asked them to come to England to train with Arsenal without the permission of Fluminense; however, they were dissuaded from this by their mother, who reminded them that they had been with Fluminense since they were 11, and that they should show the club some loyalty. Therefore, they decided to sign for Manchester United over Arsenal, and the two clubs agreed a deal in February 2007; the twins moved to Manchester in January 2008 without ever having played for the Fluminense first team.
Manchester United.
2008–09 season.
The twins decided to sign for Manchester United, and a deal was agreed between the two clubs in February 2007. The twins moved to Manchester in January 2008, but were unable to play in matches until they turned 18 in July 2008. Rafael made his first appearance for the club in a 2–0 friendly win over Peterborough United on 4 August. Rafael was then registered in the club's senior squad for the 2008–09 season and was assigned the number 21 shirt. Rafael made his competitive debut for Manchester United on the opening day of the 2008–09 Premier League season, replacing Fraizer Campbell in their 1–1 home draw Newcastle United on 17 August.
Rafael's first start for Manchester United came on 23 September in their 3–1 home victory over Middlesbrough in the Third Round of the League Cup. Rafael made first start in European competition in United's 3–0 away win over Aalborg BK in the UEFA Champions League on 30 September. Rafael made his first Premier League start in Manchester United's 4–0 home win over West Bromwich Albion on 18 October. On 8 November, Rafael scored his first goal for Manchester United, netting a 90th minute consolation goal in a 2–1 defeat to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. On 19 April 2009, in the FA Cup semi-final against Everton, Rafael and his twin brother Fábio started a match together for Manchester United for the first time. United, however, lost the match 4–2 on penalties. At the end of Rafael's first professional season, he and his Manchester United teammate Jonny Evans were shortlisted as nominees for the PFA Young Player of the Year award. The two of them, however, were beaten to the award by Aston Villa's Ashley Young. In recognition of his successful first season in English football, Rafael was handed a two-year extension to his Manchester United contract, tying him to the club until 2013.
2009–10 season.
On 27 October 2009, Fábio, Rafael's twin brother, was booked for a foul committed by Rafael in United's 2–0 League Cup victory over Barnsley. Manchester United appealed and The FA agreed it was a case of mistaken identity, transferring the card over to Rafael. On 30 December, Rafael scored the second goal of his Manchester United career and the first at Old Trafford in a 5–0 league win over Wigan Athletic. On 7 April 2010, Rafael was sent off for the first time in his United career, receiving two yellow cards either side of half-time against Bayern Munich in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final tie. Despite United winning the game, they were eliminated from the competition due to the away goals rule when the aggregate score was 4–4. Despite this red card, Sir Alex Ferguson praised Rafael for his performance and stated that "he absolutely dominated Franck Ribéry."
2010–11 season.
On 16 January 2011, Rafael was sent off for a second occasion, collecting two bookings in a 0–0 league draw against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Rafael received an £8,000 fine and a warning about his future conduct by The FA following his red card. Rafael suffered a concussion in United's 3–2 away victory over Blackpool on 25 January, the match following his one-game ban, and was taken to hospital for X-rays before later being released. Rafael collided with Blackpool's Marlon Harewood during the second half, which resulted in 10 minutes of stoppage time, and forced Rafael out of United's FA Cup tie away to Southampton on 29 January.
2011–12 season.
Rafael made his first competitive start of the season since the Community Shield victory back in August against Crystal Palace in the League Cup on 20 November 2011, a game which United lost 2–1 in extra time. On 31 December, Rafael started his first league game of the season against Blackburn Rovers, playing in an unusual defensive midfield role with Park Ji-Sung before moving to right-back for the second half. He was later replaced by Will Keane in the 85th minute.
2012–13 season.
On 2 July 2012, Rafael signed a new four-year contract which will keep him at the club until 2016. For the 2012–13 season, Rafael was given the number 2 shirt, previously worn by Gary Neville, who retired in 2011. After missing the opening game of the season, he returned to play against Fulham on 25 August 2012, and scored United's third goal (and his third for the club) in a 3–2 win. On 23 September 2012, Rafael scored the equalising goal in a 1–2 United win at Anfield over Liverpool. After receiving a layoff from Shinji Kagawa, he cut inside onto his left foot and curled a shot past Pepe Reina and into the top corner. On 23 October 2012, Rafael made his 100th appearance for United in a 3–2 win over Portuguese side Braga. On 23 February 2013, Rafael scored United's first goal in a 0–2 league win away to Queens Park Rangers, hitting the ball on the half-volley from 25 yards out, through a crowd of players and into the top corner of the goal. On 5 May, Rafael was sent off against Chelsea for a challenge on David Luiz.
International career.
In 2007, Rafael played for Brazil's national under-17 team in the FIFA U-17 World Cup. He was approached by Portuguese national coach Carlos Queiroz and asked to play for Portugal's senior side, as both Rafael and Fábio hold Portuguese citizenship. Rafael indicated a willingness to take Queiroz up on his offer if he did not end up playing for Brazil, while Fábio remained set on playing for Brazil. 
On 26 July 2010, Rafael was called up to the Brazilian senior team for the first time, as he was included in new coach Mano Menezes' first squad for their friendly against the United States on 10 August.
Rafael was originally left out of the Brazil squad for their friendlies in May and June 2012, but was later called up to replace the injured Daniel Alves. FC Porto right back Danilo was selected ahead of Rafael for the game against Denmark on 26 May, but he did eventually come on as a substitute to make his senior international debut. On 26 July 2012, Rafael scored Brazilian under-23 team's first goal of the Olympics in a 3–2 victory over Egypt.
In December 2013, The Times reported that he had considered representing England at international level, however he decided against it. He was not eligible for England as he had represented Brazil in 2007 at U17 level in an FIFA recognised 'official competition' meaning that the only national teams he could choose between would be Brazil and Portugal - the nations he was eligible to represent at the time he played in the 2007 South American Under-17 Football Championship.
Playing style.
Along with his brother Fábio, Rafael has been praised for his energetic style, and has been described as an "excellent footballer" by Sir Alex Ferguson. Les Kershaw, the former Manchester United academy manager who spotted them, described the pair as being like "two little whippets," praising how "when they got knocked down, they just got straight back up again and got on with it. They were like bouncing balls... very, very quick." "The Times" has called them "Brazil's answer to the Neville brothers (Gary and Phil Neville)."
Personal life.
Rafael's twin brother Fábio is also a professional footballer; both twins signed for Manchester United at the same time in 2008. The twins' elder brother, Luiz Henrique Pereira da Silva, used to play for América-MG in Brazil and Brescia in Italy, but moved with his wife to England when the twins signed for Manchester United. After a six-week wait for international clearance, Luiz Henrique signed for Radcliffe Borough, but he and his wife returned to Brazil in early 2009 in preparation for the birth of their child, where he returned to England few months later.
Despite starting their careers at Fluminese, both Fábio and Rafael are actually supporters of their local rivals Botafogo.
Rafael is married to Carla. On 4 January 2012, the couple had their first child, a girl named Eduarda.

Count (Graf) Johann Nepomuk (Hans) Wilczek (born on December 7, 1837 Vienna; d. January 27, 1922 in the same city) was an Austro-Hungarian sponsor of Polar expeditions and artists.
Young Hans Wilczek studied archaeology, art history and natural sciences. In 1863 he travelled to Russia, including Crimea and the Caucasus. Then, in 1866, he enlisted in the Austro-Prussian War as a volunteer. Between 1868 and 1870 he travelled across Africa.
Count Wilczek was the main sponsor of the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition, led by Julius Payer and Karl Weyprecht from 1872 to 1874. He contributed with an amount that was significantly greater than the funds contributed by the second largest sponsor of the venture, Hungarian Count Ödon Zichy (1811–1894).
From 1875 onwards, Count Wilczek held the title of President of the Austrian Geographical Society in order to promote the construction of weather stations in the Arctic. The Austrian polar station on Jan Mayen Island was built and equipped in 1882 fully at his own costs.
As promoter of the fine arts, Count Wilczek was the founder of the "Viennese Society of Art Lovers" (Gesellschaft der Wiener Kunstfreunde). He ordered the construction of Burg Kreuzenstein close to Vienna between 1874 and 1906. This monumental mansion is now a museum that houses his extensive art collections. 
Wilczek Land and Wilczek Island, two islands in Franz Josef Land, were named after this Austrian Count.

Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce

The Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce (檳州中华工商会), established in June 1903, was the first Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Malaya.
History.
Established in 1903, the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce (PCCC) was one of the pioneer trade organizations founded at the turn of the twentieth century in this region.
A 1908 article gives an idea of the early history of the Chamber:
"Among prominent mercantile houses of Pinang there are many conducted by Chinese who follow closely and successfully the methods of Western competitors. As might be expected, the proprietors of these establishments have been quick to recognise the value and importance of an organisation for the protection of their common interests. In June, 1903, they founded the Pinang Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture. This institution has a membership representing about a hundred firms, and is open to Chinese merchants, traders, agents and others interested in the commerce and agriculture of the settlement. The object of its promoters is not only the protection of common trade interests , but also the collection and classification of mercantile information and the establishment of a court of arbitration to adjust commercial differences. The offices of the Chamber are in the Tin Exchange Rooms. The office-holders are Mr. Lim Kek Chuan (林克全), president; Mr. Leong Lok Hing (梁樂卿), vice-president; Mr. Yeow Paik Tat, treasurer; and Mr. Kaw Cheng Sian (辜禎善), secretary. The committee is composed of Messrs Quah Beng Kee (柯孟淇), Goh Boon Keng (吳文景), Goh Say Eng (吳世榮), Oon Boon Tan (溫文旦), Lim Seng Hooi (林成輝), Ong Hun Chong (王漢宗), Khaw Joo Tok (許如琢), Lo Poey Chee (羅培芝), Ng See Sin (吳時信), Chung Thye Phin (鄭大平), Oh Ah Min, Yeap Yin Khye.
In January 1946 the British Military Administration decided to end Penang's duty-free status. That together with the plan to break up the Straits Settlements and impose the Malayan Union prompted the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce to lead a protest of Penang's chambers of commerce including the Penang Indian Chamber of Commerce and the Penang Muslim Chamber of Commerce. The protests aimed at the Colonial Office proved successful and Penang's free port status was restored in June 1946.
Around 1948 The Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce donated 7,770 Straits dollars for the establishment of a Chinese consulate which was eventually closed in January 1950;
The Chamber is now one of the strongest commercial institutions in Malaysia in terms of membership and organizational and functional characteristic that is well recognized by both the public and private sectors. In 2003, the Registrar of Society of Malaysia (ROS) presented the Award Certificate of Excellent Society to the Chamber. It has also been awarded the ISO 9001:2000 Quality Management System (QMS) Certificate in March 2006.
Objectives.
(a) to improve and develop trade and industry.
(b) to collect, collate and disseminate commercial information and to issue certificates of authentication.
(c) to arbitrate and settle trade and industrial disputes.
(d) to collect and compile trade statistics.
(e) to organize trade exhibitions, seminars and human resource development programmes either on its own or in collaboration with other institution(s).
(f) to support charitable, cultural and educational institutions.
Membership.
The Chamber now has more than a thousand members composed of individuals, corporations as well as commercial associations and trade guilds. The members of PCCC are from various business sectors, including enterprises, financial institutions, listed companies, housing & construction, garment & textiles, sole-agents & retailers.
Organization.
Policy formulation and decision making at the highest level of PCCC are vested in a 51-member General Committee headed by a President; assisted by a Deputy President and 3 Vice-Presidents. A 14-member Executive Committee elected from the ranks of the General Committee meet regularly to supervise the implementation of the policies and strategies formulated and planned by the latter while a permanent Secretariat takes charge of the day-to-day running of the Chamber's affairs.
There are 10 Working Committees and 3 "Ad Hoc" Committees charged with various specific functional topics such as small and medium enterprises & human resources development, economics, finance & taxation, housing & construction, infrastructure & public facilities, information technology, transport, logistics & customs, Malaysia-China business development, tourism etc. all geared towards complementing the Chamber's important role as a conduit for the exchange of views and information between the Authorities and business community and in promoting the interest of its members in particular and the economic well-being of the country in general.
Links.
The Chamber has great rapport with the Government at regional as well as national level through its direct affiliation to the Associated Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia and indirect connection with the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia. PCCC is officially represented at the following public bodies:

Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response

Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response first came to public attention with the release of a report in February 2002 of a joint assessment mission examining the issue. The joint mission (composed of UNHCR-SCFUK personnel) reported that "refugee children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been subjected to sexual abuse and exploitation, reportedly by employees of national and international NGOs, UNHCR and other UN bodies..."
Humanitarian agencies responded almost immediately with measures designed to prevent further abuse, setting up an inter-agency task force with the objective of "strengthening and enhancing the protection and care of women and children in situations of humanitarian crisis and conflict..."
In 2008 there were signs that sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries not only continued, but was under-reported.
In January 2010, the ECHA/ECPS task force developed a website devoted to protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) by personnel of the United Nations (UN), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other international organizations.
UNHCR/SCF UK report.
A summary of the main findings of the report may be found in an article written by one of the original authors. The report was based on a field mission by the team, which conducted interviews and focus groups with approximately 1,500 individuals (children and adults) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone:
The researchers found that not only was sexual exploitation widespread, it was also perpetrated by aid workers, peacekeepers, and community leaders. Humanitarian workers traded food and relief items for sexual favors. Teachers in schools in the camps exploited children in exchange for passing grades. Medical care and medicines were given in return for sex. Some forty-two agencies and sixty-seven individuals were implicated in this behavior. Parents pressured their children to enter sexually exploitative relationships in order to secure relief items for the family.
Response by humanitarian agencies.
Investigation and sanctions.
The allegations were investigated by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), which in October 2002 issued a report concluding that it found "no widespread abuse by aid workers". In an interview with CNN in May 2002, High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers stated, "We hardly find concrete evidence. It's very scarce". Save the Children UK (a partner in the original study) responded, "Nothing that the UN has found makes us think that we were wrong".
Prevention.
In July 2002, the UN’s Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) adopted a plan of action which stated that sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are, therefore, grounds for termination of employment. The plan explicitly prohibited the “Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour”. The major NGHAs and the UN agencies engaged in humanitarian response committed themselves to setting up internal structures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries.
UN Secretary-General's bulletin.
A step towards protection from sexual exploitation was taken by the UN with its publication of the Secretary-General's Bulletin, "Special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse." The purpose of the bulletin was to draw up standards for protecting vulnerable populations (particularly women and children) from sexual exploitation and abuse. It defines sexual exploitation as:
Any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from sexual exploitation of another.
Building Safer Organisations project.
In November 2004 a collaborative effort by a number of NGOs set up the Building Safer Organisations project (BSO), to develop the capacity of NGOs "to receive and investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse brought by persons of concern—including refugees, displaced persons and local host populations". Hosted at the outset as a pilot project by the umbrella organization, the International Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA), the project initially developed training materials. Using these materials, the BSO project carried out participatory workshops for NGO and UN staff. As of June 2006, a total of 137 NGO staff took part in management or investigation workshops. In April 2007 BSO was moved to Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International, where it has been merged with HAP's complaints unit. By April 2008, BSO had held "16 Investigation workshops; seven Investigations Follow-up workshops; seven Management workshops as well as four Training of Trainers workshops and 1 Complaints Mechanisms workshop. 522 humanitarian agency staff has participated in the BSO Learning Programme workshops."
Since its inception, BSO has been helping organisations apply principles of good complaint-and-response systems to cases of sexual exploitation and abuse by staff. BSO helps NGOs achieve greater accountability by: 
An independent evaluation by the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children concluded that the "BSO learning program has proven a valuable tool for humanitarian agencies in strengthening their capacity to receive and investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries by staff...(and) BSO learning program materials are effective and well received".
Reasons for few complaints.
Two 2008 studies have pointed out that disaster survivors who have been sexually exploited (or abused) by aid workers often do not complain. Save the Children explains the lack of complaints thus:
On 25 June 2008 the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International (HAP) released a report on sexual exploitation and abuse, "To complain or not to complain: still the question." This report includes details for three countries in which consultations were held. It concludes:
Sexual exploitation and abuse is a predictable result of a failure of accountability to beneficiaries of humanitarian aid. The single most important reason for this ‘humanitarian accountability deficit’ is the asymmetrical principal-agent relations that characterise most ‘humanitarian’ transactions, that puts the users of humanitarian assistance at a structural disadvantage in their relationship with humanitarian aid providers.

The Butterfly Effect (Heroes)

"The Butterfly Effect" is the second episode of the third season of the NBC science fiction drama series "Heroes" and thirty-sixth episode overall. It was written by series creator/executive producer Tim Kring and directed by Greg Beeman. The episode aired on September 22, 2008 immediately after "The Second Coming" as part of the three-hour premiere event.
Plot.
Claire Bennet realizes that she no longer feels pain when injured. Claire films herself trying to be hit by a train, but Future Peter, masquerading as Present Peter, intervenes before the impact; he then teleports away.
Meanwhile, two Company agents, Bianca Karina and Gael Cruz, attempt to capture Sylar. He kills them both with a small hand gesture.
Tracy enters Nathan's hospital room to offer him a seat on the Senate. Nathan believes that Tracy is Niki Sanders, but she insists that she is not. Tracy leaves, somewhat disturbed, and Linderman appears, confirming that Tracy is not Niki.
At the Company, Elle Bishop finds her father, Bob's body with his brain removed. She then lets Noah out of his cell on Level 5, giving him a gun and telling him that Sylar is in the building. Elle is telekinetically thrown down the hall by Sylar, so Noah shoots him several times. However, Sylar regenerates and explains that he's already taken Claire's power. He attempts to take Elle's power by cutting her head open. Elle screams and releases a large electrical discharge that knocks Sylar out and allows the Level 5 prisoners to escape their cells.
Future Peter explains to Nathan that he is actually from the future and came to the present to stop him from revealing their powers. Nathan proceeds to call Tracy and accept her offer as Future Peter leaves.
Tracy, walking to her car in the parking garage, is confronted by a reporter, (cameo by "Hero" William Katt), who uses a video feed of Nathan and Jessica Sanders (from season 1) to try to blackmail her to get her to admit she is Niki, a stripper from Las Vegas. An angry Tracy grabs him, and her emotions trigger her ability of cryokinesis. She accidentally freezes him solid, and he shatters on the ground, dead. Tracy flees the scene.
Later, Nathan is playing a game of chess with Linderman when a nurse comes in to tell him it is time for lights out, and she comments that he can end a game of chess he's playing by himself. Linderman then reveals that only Nathan can see him.
Hiro and Ando travel to Daphne's apartment in Paris, looking for the formula that she stole. Hiro notices an award of Daphne's for a track meet from when she was young. When Daphne arrives, Hiro offers her the award, which he has now stolen from her, in exchange for the formula. Daphne attempts to take both items. Hiro stops time, but she holds a knife to Ando's throat, since Ando cannot move, and starts to make a cut. Hiro allows her to get away with both items, but when time resumes, he explains to Ando about the tracking device he had slipped into the award. Ando, however, notices his neck is bleeding, and is astonished that Hiro let him get hurt.
Maya returns to Mohinder's lab, and witnesses him hanging from the ceiling by his legs. She watches as he jumps down, unharmed, and climbs back up the wall, in an insect type of fashion, and after he explains his new powers, Maya expresses her excitement with the results of his new transformation. They then kiss passionately after Mohinder makes an uncharacteristically rash pass at her.
With Bob's death, Angela becomes the new head of the Company, and her first act is to implement some changes, starting with firing Elle. Noah Bennet, now released, returns to his home and finds Claire, alive. Though relieved to see her, he tells her that he can't stay at home because of the escaped villains and prepares to deal with them, shooting down Claire's offer to partner up. When Claire mentions the possibility of being attacked at home, Noah tells her that he had considered that; to make sure Claire stays safe at home, Noah and Sandra reveal their enlistment of the aid of none other than Meredith Gordon, Claire's biological mother, to protect the family in Noah's absence.
Future Peter teleports to Level 5, where Angela angrily informs him that the villains have escaped. Future Peter wonders how this happened different from his time, and also exclaims that he had trapped the present Peter in the body of one of the escaped villains specifically because this didn't occur in his timeline. Angela berates him about the Butterfly Effect and blames him for the deviations he has caused from the future she has seen.
Peter Petrelli, trapped in the body of Jesse Murphy, is forced to accompany the other villains in order not to compromise his true identity. As Flint burns a woman alive, and The German punches a man to death, Peter is forced to watch helplessly.
Angela Petrelli ends the episode by going into the cell Sylar occupies and offers him the comforts that a mother should provide for a child. Sylar denies that Angela is his mother, but Angela persists that she is.
Production.
Actor Stephen Tobolowsky had been thrown off of a horse in Iceland and broke his neck in five places between filming for seasons two and three of "Heroes". Although he will make a full recovery, due to his injury he was only able to play his role as Bob Bishop in two brief scenes, confined to Bob's office chair and with severely limited levels of movement.
Trivia.
Angela Petrelli's dream, shown in this episode, was shown as a special sneak peek of "Villains" in the "Volume 2: Generations" DVD box set, with several elements edited due to spoilers.
Critical Reception.
In the 18-49 demographic, "The Butterfly Effect" earned a 5.2/12 ratings share. The episode was watched by 9.57 million viewers. 
Sean O'Neal of "The A.V. Club" rated this episode, together with the previous episode, a B+.
Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 6.7 out of 10.

Pandit Taba Ram Turki

Pandit Taba Ram Turki (1776 to 1847) lived at Rainawari, Srinagar and wrote Persian poetry under the pen name of Betab. Betab made an important contribution to the Persian poetry and he commanded great respect among the poets of Kashmir of his time. His poetry reached as far as Central Asia. Some critics have rated Betab's works at par with the Shahnama of Firdausi.
Mulla Mohammad Taufiq Kashmiri, another popular Persian poet of the era who lived near Jama Masjid area of Srinagar and wrote under the pen name of Taufiq had friendly relations with Betab.
Betab composed his writings in the form of masnawis which contain historical details of his times (a masnawi is a long epic poem describing the battles fought and past events and may also include philosophical or ethical themes).
It is believed that Betab travelled to Kabul to meet the general and wazir of Afghanistan prince Mohammad Akbar Khan. Betab praised his patron Mohammad Akbar Khan in the poem Akbar-nama. 
Betab then witnessed the invasion of the Sikh army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh over his native land Kashmir and the defeat of the Afghan governor Muhammad Azim Khan in 1819, which he versified under the title Jang-nama.
After the change of rulers, Betab visited Lahore for a meeting with Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Following his return from Lahore, Betab composed one more masnawi containing historical details like the other two named Ranjit-nama.
J.K. Banerji in the book Encyclopaedia of Kashmir mentions "Outstanding among the Hindu Pandits who made important contributions to Persian poetry may be mentioned the name of Pandit Taba Ram Turki "Betab" whose Jang Nama reached classic heights."
Further eminent historian and author Gwasha Lal Kaul in the same book Encyclopaedia of Kashmir mentions "Jangnama by Taba Ram Turki stands on the same footing as Shahnama of Firdausi".

Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei

A/S Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei or KES, nicknamed the Blue Tram (), is a defunct operator of parts of the Oslo Tramway, Norway. It opened the first electric tramway in Scandinavia in 1894, and remained in service until 1924 when it was merged into the municipal owned Oslo Sporveier.
History.
Tram transport in Oslo (at the time called Kristiania) started in 1875 with horsecar services provided by Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS). Economically this was an inferior operating method, and Christiania (later Kristiania) Elektriske Sporvei was founded to establish an electric tram service. The initiative came from H. E. Heyerdahl, A. Fenger-Krog and L. Samson and KSS immediately attempted to buy the company, but the purchase failed, and on 2 March 1894 the first line, from the Eastern Railway Station (Østbanen) via Briskeby to Majorstuen was established, along with a branch line to Skillebekk (today part of the Skøyen Line). At first a shuttle service was provided on the branch line, but by April a through service was offered to Østbanen. The Skillebekk Line was extended on 31 December 1894 to Nobels Gate, to Thune in 1901 and to Skøyen on 21 June 1903.
The last street line was opened in 1902 from Østbanen to Frogner Plass—known as the Frogner Line. It was extended to Majorstuen, where the depot was located, on 15 May 1914, along with a line from Frogner Plass to Skarpsno on the Skøyen Line. From 1909 the company introduced numbered services, and had the following lines:
The company bought 78 cars and 66 trailers; 20 of the cars were later rebuilt to trailers. The main manufacturers were Herbrand, Falkenried and Skabo, delivering a continual stream of stock to the company until 1914, after which only ten units were delivered. The second delivered unit, number 102, has been preserved and can be found at the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology.
From 1912 a number of connections were built between the KES and KSS networks, and the two companies started cooperating on certain lines. On 9 May 1919 the company extended the Skøyen Line to Lilleaker as a suburban tramway, now called the Lilleaker Line. In 1924 the concession of both the street tram companies expired, and they were taken over by the municipal owned Oslo Sporveier. The section from Skøyen to Lilleaker was not located in Oslo, but in Aker, and the municipality was not interested in operating it. Instead the ownership was transferred to the company Bærumsbanen, with the same owners as KES.

Bill Standifer

Bill Standifer, also known as "Little Bill" Standifer (1853 - October 4, 1903) was a gunman and lawman of the Old West. He is best remembered for having been killed by noted and better known gunman John "Pink" Higgins in 1903.
Early life and notoriety.
Standifer was born J. William "Bill" Standifer in Burnet County, Texas, and raised in Lampasas County, Texas, working cattle. By the age of 14, he was working regularly as a cowboy. That year, when he came across four men rustling cattle, he was pistol whipped by the men and badly hurt, but survived. Despite his youth, he tracked all four men, and killed them one by one. Although charges were pursued, he was acquitted. 
In April 1879, Standifer was working as a cowboy on the "Ike Mullins Ranch", in Tom Green County, Texas, where he came into contact with another cowboy, John McMahon, sometimes called John Mahon. The two found themselves involved in an argument when Standifer refused to allow McMahon to drive cattle across a pasture where Standifer was holding several head of Mullin's cattle. McMahon produced a bullwhip, while a companion pointed a rifle at Standifer, then McMahon began whipping Standifer. Both men were mounted, and Standifer was able to ride away to escape. Days later, Standifer tracked McMahon to a cattle camp near Pony Creek, located in Coleman County. As Standifer rode up, McMahon was mounted talking with several other cowboys. Upon seeing Standifer, McMahon drew his pistol and fired, but missed. Standifer drew and fired also, hitting McMahon in the wrist, causing his pistol to fall from his grip. McMahon spun his horse and galloped away, with Standifer in pursuit. The two made it about 600 yards from where the shootout began, with Standifer shooting McMahon again in the back, knocking him from his saddle. McMahon scrambled to his feet and attempted to run, but was again shot in the back, killing him. 
Standifer fled, making it to Marfa, Texas, where he became involved in a saloon argument with three soldiers from Fort Davis, during which he shot and wounded two of them, before fleeing. Members of the Texas Rangers hunted Standifer down for the McMahon killing, and arrested him. However he was acquitted in a trial. Those shootings led to Standifer becoming known as a "gunman", and helped him in gaining employment as a Range Detective.
Lawman career, feud with John Higgins.
By the early 1880s, Standifer was working as a Range Detective, tracking down rustlers, and is known to have shot and killed at least one rustler near Estacado, Texas. When the demand for his services dwindled, Standifer ran and was elected as County Sheriff for Crosby County, Texas from 1888 through 1892. While serving as Sheriff, in 1891, he and Deputy Charlie Quillen pursued a group of Post Office thieves into Lincoln County, New Mexico, where they captured them. 
On the return trip to Texas, while staying over at the "VVN Ranch" owned by George Neal, the outlaws attempted to overpower him and Deputy Quillen. The deputy was shot and wounded in the chest with his own rifle, but was able to wrestle the outlaw to the floor and overpower him. The shot had also wounded George Neal's wife. Standifer, who was outside tending the horses, heard the wife scream, and ran inside. Another of the outlaws had acquired Standifer's shotgun, but when Standifer entered, the shotgun misfired. Standifer beat the suspect into submission, then assisted Deputy Quillen. That same night he shackled all three outlaws, and rode with them and Quillen to the nearest doctor. Deputy Quillen survived, and the two were later able to take their prisoners on to Texas. 
In 1893 he began working again as a Range Detective for large and prosperous ranches in the Texas Panhandle, mainly the powerful "Spur Ranch", located in Spur, Texas, where he first met John "Pink" Higgins, a notable gunman already known to Standifer, since they were both from Lampasas, Texas. Standifer quickly gained a reputation for being an excellent tracker, and for always locating his prey. In June 1898, while tracking rustlers, Standifer arrived in Clairemont, Texas, a rough town at the time, and the location in which Jeff Hardin, brother to gunman John Wesley Hardin, had been shot and killed. Standifer located a rustler named Bob Kiggins there, but Kiggins refused to surrender, and in the gunfight that followed Standifer shot and killed Kiggins. 
During this period, an animosity between Standifer and Higgins developed, one that has never truly been explained. It has been written that the Horrell Brothers, who were brought down mostly through the efforts of "Pink" Higgins, and who were distant kin to Standifer, was part of their problems. However, it is more likely that it was due to Higgins son, Cullin, an attorney, who had only recently represented Standifer's wife in her divorce from Standifer. Fred Horsbrugh, manager of the "Spur Ranch", fired both Higgins and Standifer due to the increasing hostilities between them. However, Horsbrugh allowed Higgins to stay on for a time after this, until he could find another job. This angered Standifer. In 1900, Standifer moved to Hartley County, Texas, where he was elected Sheriff. 
At one point, just prior to Higgins leaving the "Spur Ranch", he was dispatched to investigate a possible cattle rustling on a remote section of the ranch. Making a circular approach, Higgins spotted Standifer waiting in a group of trees. Rather than approach him, and knowing he was there to ambush him, Higgins simply went home. However, the animosity continued. On the morning of October 4, 1903, after having made comments that he would kill Higgins, Standifer rode out to Higgins ranch. Higgins, seeing him from his house, rode out to meet him. Higgins brother-in-law and daughter were standing on a hillside nearby, and witnessed what happened next. Standifer fired first, hitting Higgins horse, which then jerked, causing Higgins first shot to go wild. In the shooting exchange that followed, Standifer was shot and killed. Higgins horse also died. 
Higgins then retrieved another horse, and contacted Sheriff B. F. Roy, in Clairemont. When Higgins told Sheriff Roy that he believed he had killed Standifer, Sheriff Roy, who disliked Standifer for reasons unknown, stated "Well if you're not sure, you'd better go and finish the job". The shooting was ruled justifiable homicide, and Higgins was never arrested or tried. He buried Standifer himself, on the Higgins property, naming the thicket where he is buried "Standifer's Thicket".

John Matthews (soda water manufacturer)

John Matthews (1808–1870) was an English-born American inventor and soda water manufacturer. He is known as "The Soda Fountain King".
Matthews manufactured carbonating machinery and distributed his product through retail stores. The equipment was a lead-lined cast-iron box where carbonic acid gas was formed by mixing sulphuric acid with marble dust. The gas was then purified by passing it through water, and then into a tank partially filled with cool water. The tank was rocked for a quarter to a half hour, until the water was impregnated and bubbly.
Matthews created a fountain apparatus that could be positioned on a pharmacist’s counter to dispense carbonated drinks, leading to its popularisation and rapid growth.
He is buried at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York. His monument was designed by Karl Muller and cost $30,000.

Ruth Fischer

Ruth Fischer (11 December 1895 – 13 March 1961) was a German Communist, a co-founder of the Austrian Communist Party in 1918. According to secret information declassified in 2010, she was a key agent of the American intelligence service known as "The Pond". She later became a staunch anti-Communist activist.
Life and work.
Fischer was born Elfriede Eisler in Leipzig in 1895, the daughter of Marie (née Fischer) and Rudolf Eisler, a professor of philosophy at Leipzig. Her father was Jewish and her mother was Lutheran.
She was the elder sister to noted film and concert composer Hanns Eisler and fellow communist activist Gerhart Eisler. She studied philosophy, economics and politics at the University of Vienna where her father was working. She moved to Berlin in 1919 and she was a leader of the Communist Party of Germany from 1924 to 1925. Espousing left-wing positions, she was a member of the Reichsrat from 1924 to 1928. She fled to Paris in 1933 and then to the United States in 1941. In the late 1940s, she testified before HUAC against her brother, Hanns, resulting in his blacklisting and deportation.
She also testified that another brother, Gerhart, was a major Communist agent. The Communist press denounced her as a "German Trotskyite". She propounded critical views of Stalinism and called for a rebirth of Communism after Stalin's death. Before this period of anti-Stalinism, she had reportedly been instrumental in the rise to power of the Triumvirs (Stalin, Grigory Zinoviev, and Lev Kamenev), viciously denouncing Trotsky at the fifth congress of the Communist International. 
Isaac Deutscher, a biographer of Trotsky and Stalin, described her as a "young, trumpet-tongued woman, without any revolutionary experience or merit, yet idolized by the Communists of Berlin." In 1955, she returned to Paris and published her books "Stalin and German Communism" and "Die Umformung der Sowjetgesellschaft". From eight years after the second World War, Fischer, code-named "Alice Miller", was a key agent for "The Pond". She died in Paris in 1961, aged 65, from undisclosed causes.

The Defence of Duffer's Drift

"The Defence of Duffer's Drift" is a short 1904 book by Major General Sir Ernest Dunlop Swinton. It purports to be a series of six dreams by "Lieutenant Backsight Forethought" about the defence of a river crossing in the Boer War. The infantry tactics in the early dreams are disastrous, but each time BF learns something until in the final defence he is successful.
History.
"The Defence of Duffer's Drift" was published in 1904 when Swinton was a Captain. It appeared in the British United Service Magazine under the pseudonym, Lieutenant N. Backsight Forethought ("BF"), who is the narrator of the book. The book is an exploration of small unit tactics in a fictional encounter in the Boer War. Swinton served in South Africa during the Boer War, and the book "embodies some recollections of things actually done and undone in South Africa, 1899–1902."
Lieutenant Backsight Forethought and his command of fifty men are given the task to defend Duffer's Drift, a natural ford to a river. A large force of Boers, unknown to BF, is moving toward his position. This scenario is played out six separate times, in six "dreams." In the early scenarios, BF and his British troops are ignominiously defeated. After each defeat, BF learns lessons and adapts his strategy for the later encounters. The later dreams end more inconclusively, and in the final dream, BF and his command successfully hold out long enough to be relieved. The book encourages critical thinking and careful use of position and terrain to mount a successful defence.
"The Defence of Duffer's Drift" was reprinted in the April 1905 edition of the Journal of the United States Infantry Association. The book, especially intended for young lieutenants, has become a military staple on small unit tactics, read far afield in places such as the United States, Russia, and Canada.
Storyline.
Lieutenant Backsight Forethought (BF to his friends) has been left in command of a 50-man reinforced platoon to hold Duffer's Drift, the only ford on the Silliassvogel River available to wheeled traffic. Here is his chance for fame and glory. He has passed his officer courses and special qualifications. "Now if they had given me a job, say like fighting the Battle of Waterloo, of Gettysburg, or Bull Run, I knew all about that, as I had crammed it up..." While BF's task appears simple enough the Boer enemy causes a multitude of problems, but the astute reader, with a sharp mind and quick intellect, will no doubt, solve the problem before the first shot is fired.
Lessons learned.
The following are the lessons learned discussed in this book.
Influence.
"The Defence of Duffer's Drift's" style of literary fiction has been copied by several authors, making this author an influence upon the writings of others. Four examples are provided: one, a mechanized battalion level primer, one military combat service support example, another one that is non-military related, and a third adopting the parable to operations in Iraq.
The first was "Defense Of Hill 781", written by James R. McDonough in 1988, dealing with a somewhat larger combat element that the original, and having a slightly different reason for the "dreams". The second was written by Staff Sergeants Reginald Scott and Steve Newman, along with Sergeants William Baucom, Rodney Weathers, and Louise Chee in the September 2001 edition of "NCO Notes", number 01-2, from the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Institute of Land Warfare. The title of this story was "The Defense of Duffer's Drift Brigade Support Area". Instead of trying to teach infantry tactics, the authors of this story focused upon a supply company of a forward support battalion in an effort to teach units inside of a Brigade Support Area to become more effective in defensive operations during combat [http://www.ausa.org/programs/nco/notes/NCO%20Notes/nn01-2.pdf].
The third was written by Dr. Scott S. Haraburda, PhD, PE, in 2008 for a non-military topic, even though it involved the Department of Defense. His book, "Premonitions of the Palladion Project: A Modern Project Management Fable", contains information about what works and what does not work when managing a project, which can be used to assist anyone in managing a more successful project. This book provided a project management framework illustrating twenty-four project management rules. The general thesis in this book was that using just the best project management tools while forgetting everything else about running the project would doom the project to failure.
The fourth was written by Albert J. Marckwardt and Michael Burgoyne, entitled "The Defense of Jisr al-Doreaa". The book follows a young lieutenant through successive lessons while conducting stability and counterinsurgency operations in Iraq.
The Winter 2005 edition of the Canadian Army Journal contained the following praise:

Bærumsbanen

A/S Bærumsbanen was a tram company that operated the Lillaker-, Kolsås and Østensjø Line of the Oslo Tramway, Norway, from 1924 to 1971 when the company became part of Oslo Sporveier.
History.
In 1924 the two street tram operators in Oslo, Kristiania Sporveisselskab and Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei, were taken over by the municipal owned Oslo Sporveier. The final part of the Skøyen Line, from Skøyen to Lillaker was a suburban tramway located in the neighboring municipality of Aker, and the Municipality of Oslo was not interested in taking over it. Therefore the owner reorganized itself to A/S Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei Bærumsbanen (KES-BB), though changing their name to just A/S Bærumsbanen in 1935 after Oslo Sporveier bought 25% of the company on 1 October 1934.
The new company immediately started expanding the Lilleaker Line, first to Bekkestua and then to Haslum—establishing a depot at Avløs at the same time. The final extension of the line occurred on 1 January 1930 to Kolsås. From 4 January 1937 Bærumsbanen took over the operation of the Østensjø Line on the east side of Oslo, that was owned by the municipal Akersbanerne—allowing the company to operate through services from Oppsal to Kolsås.
To shorten travel time on the outer part of the Lilleaker Line, the company received permission in 1938 build a line from Jar to Sørbyhaugen on the Røa Line, allowing the trains to use the Common Tunnel shared by the other suburban lines in the west to quickly reach the city center at the underground station at Nationaltheatret. This opened on 15 June 1942—at the same time the Oppsal route was limited to running to Jar. On 1 October 1944 Oslo Sporveier bought the whole company, but not until 1 July 1971 did they fully merge.

Sattler's was a regional department store chain headquartered at 998 Broadway, Buffalo, New York, two miles (3 km) from the downtown core. They pioneered "bargain basement" retailing in the Buffalo area. Sattler's was founded in 1889 by 17-year-old John G. Sattler when he opened a one-room shoe store in his mother's home at 992 Broadway. That store would eventually become Sattler's main store which, by 1950, covered and included the flagship store. In the late-1920s the store introduced a number of innovative marketing and promotional schemes to attract customers such as weekly automobile giveaways and high wire walkers. They also resold the contents of bankrupt stores purchased in railcar lots called the "Bargain Train." Starting in 1947, they sponsored an annual Santa Claus parade.
Sattler's other Buffalo-area locations included stores in the Thruway Plaza (later Thruway Mall) in Cheektowaga, New York (1957), Boulevard Mall in Amherst, New York (1962), Seneca Mall in West Seneca, New York (1969), and Main Place Mall in downtown Buffalo (1973). In 1962-63, a store operated in Rochester, New York. In 1969, the company opened stores in Chautauqua, New York and in Olean, New York.
In September 1965, Sattler's opened an innovative home furnishings and food merchandising concept store in an old industrial plant that covered at Elmwood and Hertel Avenues in Buffalo. The $5 million, store operated as Sattler's Wonderful World of Food, Inc. and Home Furnishings City U.S.A. The store closed in 1979.
Starting in 1963, Sattler's also operated eight drug stores, including four "free standing" units. These stores closed in 1979.
The Sattler's chain, then owned by United Department Stores, closed in 1982. The flagship store was razed in 1989, and replaced with a K-Mart, which subsequently closed.

The Divine Worshipper

"The Divine Worshipper" is a historical fiction novel written by Christian Jacq. The story follows on from the previous book, "Manhunt", in which the young scribe Kel, aided by his wife Nitis and friend Bebon, try to clear his name of murders he did not commit. It takes place in ancient Egypt during the reign of the pharaoh Amasis (alternatively translated in the book as Ahmose) in 528BC. The book was originally published in France in 2007, and translated and published in English in 2008.
Plot summary.
Accused of murders he did not commit, a young scribe named Kel is continuously evading the forces of justice in a desperate attempt to prove his innocence. Aided by Nitis (a beautiful priestess and his wife) and Bebon (an actor and his closest friend), Kel manages to flee south and eventually take refuge in Thebes, safely out of the reach of the pharaoh Ahmose and his main pursuers, Judge Gem and Henat, head of the spies.
Protected by the spiritual leader of Thebes, a venerable lady known as The Divine Worshipper, Kel manages to finally clear his name, but not in time to save Egypt, as the Persian forces swarm across the border and overrun the country.
Historical basis.
While being a work of fiction, "The Divine Worshipper" does contain elements of fact.
The Persian army overran Egypt in 526BC, when the book concludes. Led by Cambyses, this was the beginning of the 27th dynasty and 120 years of Persian occupation. The betrayal of those close to pharaoh Amasis, particularly General Phanes, Udja-Hor-resnet and Kroisos are historical facts.
The Divine Worshipper of this time was named Ankhnesneferibra. She occupied her post for sixty years.

George Davies (footballer born 1927)

George Davies (born 1 March 1927, Rednal) is a former English professional footballer who played as a wing half. He played in The Football League for Sheffield Wednesday and Chester in the 1950s.
Playing career.
Davies played for village side Llanymynech before spending four years with Oswestry Town. In June 1950 he moved to Sheffield Wednesday for £250, with his six years at Hillsborough including an appearance in the FA Cup semi–finals against Preston North End in 1953–54 at Maine Road.
After nearly 100 league appearances for Wednesday, Davies moved to Third Division North side Chester ahead of 1956–57, in a summer in which new manager John Harris also recruited Billy Foulkes, Ron Hansell and John Mulholland as a wave of enthusiasm gripped the club. Davies went on to score in a shock Welsh Cup victory over First Division side Cardiff City later in the campaign and also scored four league goals. But he managed just two league appearances early the following season and joined Wellington United, where he spent one season. After leaving football, Davies went on to work as a window cleaner in Chester.
Although he had a reputation as tough tackling player, Davies was never booked or sent off throughout his career.

Source literature

Source literature is a term with different meanings. Literature (understood as printed texts) is one kind of information source. In a way, all literature is a kind of source literature. It might, for example, be cited and used as sources in academic writings. However, if used in this broad meaning the concept becomes synonymous with literature and the term thus superfluous and meaningless.
The meaning of "source literature" is relative. From the point of view of a bibliographic index the indexed papers are "source literature". For example, in "the Social Sciences Citation Index" is a "source index" covering the journals being indexed. These journals are the "source literature" from the point of view of this index. But from the point of view of the indexed papers are the bibliographical references contained in the single papers "source literature". 
In the humanities, the term "source literature" has a more precise meaning as published sources: Many archives, for example, publish important sources to be used by historians and other scholars as reliable editions of formerly unpublished sources. The publishing of such sources requires knowledge of text philology and other fields. But this kind of expertise put into the publishing of source literature should be differentiated from the kind of expertise needed in order to use the sources in, for example, historical research. A historian may or may not use such "source literature" and on the basis of his research publish a paper, which in the UNISIST model is considered primary literature.
Fjordback Søndergaard, Andersen & Hjørland (2003) thus suggests that source literature is a distinct kind of literature to be distinguished from primary literature.

Martin Nürenbach

Martin Nürenbach, or Nurembach (unknown – 1780), was a German acrobat, actor, dancer, tight-rope-dancer and theatre director, active in Sweden, Norway and Finland. He is known as the founder of the first theatre in Norway.
Biography.
Nürenbach was the son-in-law of the theatre director-couple Carl Gottfried Seuerling and Margareta Seuerling and brother-in-law of Charlotta Seuerling. He is listed as a member in the Stenborg Troupe in a passport to Uppsala in 1767, and 1767–68 as a member of the Seuerling troupe. He was then active as "dancing master of the city" in Gothenburg, before he performed and instructed pupils in acrobatics and dance in companionship with "The Worldfamous Madame Stuart" from Scotland in Oslo in Norway in July 1770. In the end of 1770, he was a member of a Norwegian theatre troupe. In 1771, he was given permission to open the first theatre in Oslo, and during the 1771–1772 season, he was director for the first theatre house to offer plays in Norwegian by Norwegian actors in Norway. Previously, the Norwegian theatre troupes all played as travelling theatres. Unfortunately, the names of thes actors are unknown. This theatre closed down in 1772 after only one season, when the theatre-ban from 1738 was reintroduced in Norway, but has its place in the history of Norway as its first theatre, and the act for which Nürenbach is famous. In 1780, the Amateur Theatre Det Dramatiske Selskap replaced it, but Oslo and Norway had to wait for a permanent theatre until 1826 when the first version of the Christiania Theatre (first under a different name) was founded by Johan Peter Strömberg.
In September 1773, he can be found in Stockholm, where he made such a success as an acrobat in the Humlegården Theatre at the Stenborg Troupe that the troupe had to build new places to get place for the audience. He performed after every play, and also acted, as in the role of Harlequin 8 October. After this, "Nürenbach with spouse" accompanied the Stenborg troupe to Finland. Later, he bought the privilege to play theatre in Finland from Petter Stenborg in companionship with the actor Beckman. After this, his fate is unknown. In 1774–80, they would have been the only theatre in Finland. In 1781, his companion Beckman was in Stockholm and accused Nürenbach for abandoning him and taking all his actors from him; the court statement described Nürenbach as "No longer present in the Kingdom". He was to have died in Tavastia in Finland in late 1780.

Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building

The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building is a bank building located at 160 West Fort Street in downtown Detroit, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.
The building was constructed in 1927 in a Classical Revival style.
In 1951, an eight-story glass-and-marble annex, designed by Minoru Yamasaki, was added to the building. The Modern annex is clearly designed not to mimic the original building, but to make a statement all its own.
In 2004, the Federal Reserve Bank moved to a new building on Warren Avenue, leaving the building on Fort empty. A developer purchased the building with the intention of creating loft space.
In July 2011, Quicken Loans representatives were visiting the building, leading to speculation that Dan Gilbert would purchase the space. Gilbert announced the purchase on January 30, 2012.

To My Surprise (album)

To My Surprise is the only album by American alternative rock band To My Surprise. Released on October 7, 2003 by Roadrunner Records, it was the only album that the band released before disbanding in 2006. The album was intended to be self produced by Shawn Crahan and Brandon Darner, but after producer Rick Rubin was sent demos by Crahan, Rubin invited the band to Los Angeles where he assumed the role of executive producer. Following the release of the album, a music video was released for the song "In The Mood" on December 1.
The album was generally well received by critics who remarked on its diversity and significantly different musical style to that of drummer Crahan's other band Slipknot. They noted that it features music inspired by The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Weezer, among others. However the album did not appear on any sales charts.
History.
In June 2002, band members Shawn Crahan, Brandon Darner and Stevan Robinson began working on an album together. Drummer Crahan told MTV that working on this album "made find [his voice" and that with his other band Slipknot he had been "hurting for a long time for a musical voice". In an interview with Launch, he said that writing the track "The World's Too Small" was his "most magical musical experience" because " was giving more than on just one or two simple ideas." In 2003 Crahan sent producer Rick Rubin two songs that he and Darner had written, primarily to receive an opinion on the songs. However, Rubin invited the band to Cello Studios in Los Angeles to work on an album. It was there that the album featuring 11 tracks was self-produced by Crahan and Darner, with Rubin as executive producer.
On October 7, 2003, "To My Surprise" was released through Roadrunner Records. An animated music video for the track "In The Mood" was produced by BoingBoing, which was premiered on MTV's Extreme show on December 1. Also, the track "Get It To Go" was featured on the soundtrack for the video game "MVP Baseball 2004". To My Surprise did not tour in 2003 to promote the album because Crahan was working with Slipknot on their . However, they did perform a limited number shows in North America the following year.
Musical style.
Prior to the release of the album, drummer Crahan touted "To My Surprise" as "a hybrid of folk, '70s rock fuzz and schizophrenic grooves". Neil Strauss of "The New York Times" stated that each song has a unique sound, concluding that they sound like "pop songs that have been pushed off balance". In another article Strauss includes They Might Be Giants, Weezer and Faith No More as bands with similar sounding "elements". Rowan Shaeffer of "Counterculture", commented on the album's diversity, saying "to say that the is eclectic would be a gross understatement," citing Pink Floyd and Mr. Bungle as evident influences. The "Calgary Sun"s Mike Bell cited "glam, new wave, Beatles pop and country rock" as the sounds the album presents. In his review for Allmusic Robert L. Doerschuk noted that the track "Sunday" makes musical references to the single "Pleasant Valley Sunday" by The Monkees, giving the "happy, strumming guitars and skippy rhythms" as similarities. He also said that they quote "one of the darker verses in the Jim Morrison songbook".
Reception.
"To My Surprise" was met with generally favorable critical reviews, but did not appear on any sales charts. One point which was generally drawn upon was the significant difference between their musical style to that of Crahan's other band Slipknot. Reviewer Neil Strauss opens his review with a reference to the title of the album, saying, "And, truly, it is a surprise", and then going on to say that the album "is commendable not just because is different but because is good". Robert L. Doerschuk of Allmusic declares that the album—aside from the track "Say Goodbye"—"maintains a buoyant and unsubtle approach". He also noted Crahan's "muscular style" as a notable element to the album saying that "transplants well into this setting, which probably should not have been a surprise after all". The vocals on the album were praised by the reviewers at "babysue", saying "the vocals [are masculine yet right on key". When reviewing for "Calgary Sun", Mike Bell highlighted their eclectic nature and in conclusion said the album is "fittingly, fun and surprising". However Rowan Shaeffer of "Counterculture" said that their diversity was ultimately their strength and weakness; he suggested that they relied too heavily on their influences by creating songs of other bands, saying that "the only left out was the To My Surprise song".

Karl Gustav Bonuvier

Karl Gustav Bonuvier, (21 September 1776 – 1 August 1858), was a Swedish actor and theatre director, active in Sweden and Finland. He is remembered for having founded the first theatre house in Finland.
Biography.
Bonuvier was active in the Stenborg Theatre in Stockholm in 1796–99, where he played the lover in "Den dubbla intrigen" (The double intrigue) by Dumaniant, and later in the theatre troupe of his wife's brother-in-law Johan Peter Lewenhagen and in Djurgårdsteatern, before he played theatre in Finland, as the director of his own troupe, by the privilege of the Russian Czar in 1813–27. He was allowed to found a permanent theatre house in Turku in 1813. This was the first theatre house in Finland, which made Bonuvier a pioneer; previously, theatre in Finland had been conducted by travelling theatre troupes from Sweden - the Stenborg Troupe, the troupe of Martin Nürenbach, the Seuerling troupe; in 1795, the Seuerling troupe had become the first troupe active permanently in Finland under the leadership of Margareta Seuerling, but Bonuvier was the first to found a permanent theatre building. It was replaced by Åbo Svenska Teater in 1837. Karl Gustav Bonuvier was married to his colleague, the Swedish actress Ulrica Sofia Björling.

Kaos (film)

Kaos (also "Chaos" in the American release) is a 1984 Italian drama film directed by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello (1867–1933). The film's title is after Pirandello's explanation of the local name "Càvusu" of the woods near his birthplace in the neighborhood of Girgenti, on the southern coast of Sicily, as deriving from the ancient Greek word "kaos".
Plot.
The film depicts four short stories from Pirandello's 15-volume series "Novelle per un anno", which play around his birthplace in the 19th century. A raven, which in the introduction is shown to get a bell around his neck from locals, leads one from one story to the next.
An epilogue, "Colloquio con la madre" (""Conversing with Mother"), of similar length as the stories, describes Pirandello's fictional visit home many years after his mother has died. He asks his mother to retell the story of a trip to Malta she took as a child to visit her exiled father.
Awards and reception.
Kaos won the 1985 David di Donatello awards for best production and best screenplay and was nominated for best music. It also won the Silver Ribbon award for best screenplay. 
The film was very well received by critics, but its length may have prevented wide exposure. In his 2007 book The Best Movies of Our Years, M. Owen Lee considered it the best movie to come out locally in 1986 .

Irish Chess Union

The Irish Chess Union (ICU), formed in 1912, is the governing body for chess in Ireland and a member of FIDE since 1933 and the European Chess Union. The ICU promotes Chess in the Republic of Ireland and maintains the chess rating for players registered with the ICU, which are published three times a year. It runs competitions such as the Irish Chess Championship and selects teams to participate in international competitions for Ireland.
In 2005, in a dispute over fees, the Ulster Chess Union (UCU), which administers and develops chess in Northern Ireland, decided to end its affiliation to the Irish Chess Union although the UCU accepted the ICU's continued organization of the All-Ireland Championships. The UCU's application to affiliate to FIDE was rebuffed.
Before the establishment of the ICU, chess competitions in Ireland were run under organisations named "The Irish Chess Association" (formed in 1885), the "Hibernia Chess Association", or various chess clubs. The Armstrong Cup is the oldest Irish team league competition and has been played every year since 1888, perhaps giving it a claim on the longest running chess competition in the world.
While chess in Ireland has been concentrated around the big cities of Dublin, Belfast and Cork, there are a number of clubs throughout the country such as those in Ballinasloe, Derry, Drogheda, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Galway, Kilkenny, Portadown and Wicklow, to name but a few. Leagues are held in the provinces, with the winning teams (and runners up) playing off in the National Club Championships (although in recent years the Ulster leagues have not participated). The winning team and runners up are entered into the European Club Championships.
Irish Chess Journal.
The ICU had published magazines in the past such as the "Irish Chess Journal" for members of the association. In 2007, to reduce costs, this has been curtailed to a biannual online magazine. Since 2009 no journal has been produced. "Junior Chess Corner" was a magazine/ezine produced in 2007 by the ICU aimed at juniors and beginners.
There have been a number of incarnations of the official magazine from the ICU, such as "Ficheall/Irish Chess Magazine" in the 1950s and "Chess in Ireland", in the 1960s.
Competitions.
Competitions are held throughout the year mostly run by individual clubs or by provincial Unions such as the City of Dublin, Cork Congress (Mulcahy Cup), Bunratty, Limerick Open, Galway Congress, Drogheda, Malahide, Bray, Kilkenny Congress, Ulster and Leinster Championships.
A number of significant tournaments have been held in the past
Team competitions.
The "Leinster Chess Union" run chess leagues. There are six divisions, a number of them named after significant figures in Irish Chess. The Armstrong Cup is probably the oldest perpetual chess trophy in the world played continually since 1888.
In the past the O'Hanlon Cup, BEA and Bodley Cups had been divided into North and South Sections. Although geographically in Connacht, Ballinasloe have won the Bodley Cup in 2010 and 2011. Also, Ulster Club Cavan won the Leinster League BEA Cup in 1975 and 2011. "The O'Connell Cup" is a novice team competition that accommodates mainly Leinster teams but also includes teams from Cavan and Ballinasloe.
The "Lost Knights" is a new individual league tournament started by the "Leinster Chess Union". Happening over the entire season, it features many leading players from the Leinster Leagues.
The "Leinster Chess Union" also runs a knockout team competition after the team league competitions have finished, the "Branagan Cup", for players from division one and two, the "Killane Shield" for divisions three, four, five and six, and the "William Brennan Trophy" for players rated below 1500.
The "Ulster Chess Union" run a number of team league competitions in Ulster for teams mainly in the Belfast area. The Belfast and District Leagues Division One play for the Ulster Trophy/Silver King, which has been played for since 1893. The all-ulster league competition usually played in a variety of formats over the years so as to include sides from the rest of the province. The UCU also organise the individual Ulster Chess Championship for Ulster born players.
In the mid-1950s the Leinster and Ulster Chess Unions organised the "Oriel League" competition for clubs from South Ulster and North Leinster.
In Munster, there are three divisions run annually, in which club sides from Cork, Limerick, Ennis, Shannon, Tralee, Dungarvan compete.
In Connaught, Galway Chess Club is the most active holding the Galway Congress tournament, although in 2011 a Connaught Chess League was established. This was contested by Ballina, Ballinasloe, Castlebar, Galway, Manorhamilton and NUIG.
Junior chess.
Underage/Schools Chess Provincial and All Ireland competitions are held annually. The Leinster Schools Chess Association was established in 1942 running leagues through the school term, and holding the provincial championships over the Christmas holidays. Chess also features as part of the Community Games.
Glorney and Faber, Stokes and Robinson Cups.
In 1948 a Dublin businessman Cecil Parker Glorney and competitive chess player and President of Rathmines Chess Club, created the Glorney Cup. It was joined twenty years later by the Faber Cup later renamed to Jessica Gilbert Cup. These two events have been held annually and bring together national squads from across Europe (although it is mainly just between teams from Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England) for three days of intensive and extremely competitive chess. The 2008 Glorney and Faber Cups took place in Liverpool as part of its City of Culture celebrations.
"Results 2013"

Irish Braille Chess Association.
The Braille Chess Association of Ireland was established in 1985 to promote Chess among the blind and partially sighted. The BCAI is affiliated to the International Braille Chess Association, the Irish Chess Union and Irish BlindSports.
They hold the National Championships and organise teams for international Competition.
Correspondence chess.
Affiliated to the Irish Chess Union is the Irish Correspondence Chess Association (ICCA) which is the 32-county governing body organising correspondence chess activities for Irish players living at home or abroad. A non-profit organisation, they run the national championship, Irish teams and other activities. The ICCA is affiliated to the International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF).

Ettore Ovazza

Ettore Ovazza (Turin, 21 March 1892 - Intra, 11 October 1943) was an Italian Jewish banker. Believing that his privileged position would be restored after the war, Ovazza stayed on after the Germans marched into Italy. Together with his wife and children, he was killed near the Swiss border by SS troops in 1943 shortly after the collapse of Mussolini's government during World War II.
Early life and family.
He was born, one of three brothers, to the Ovazza family, a wealthy and influential Jewish banking family based in Turin. They were one of the leading banking families in Italy. His father and his three brothers voluntarily enlisted to fight in the First World War. The family was well integrated into Italian high society, while they followed Jewish traditions such as celebrating Passover. His father served as the leader of the Turinese Jewish community.
World War I.
Ettore Ovazza studied law at university and then travelled to Germany with a view to a diplomatic career. At the outbreak of World War I he had volunteered and trained as an officer, only to suffer the humiliating defeat at Caporetto. His patriotic letters from the front were published in 1928 and received general praise. After the war, the city of Turin was badly affected by the turmoil of the Biennio Rosso (Two Red Years) with repeated strikes, lockouts and violent demonstrations. The Ovazza family were alarmed by these developments.
Between war years.
Ettore Ovazza was a committed Fascist from the start. He took part in the March on Rome in October 1922; in 1929 he was invited to meet Mussolini as a part of a delegation of Jewish war veterans. He later described the encounter:
"On hearing my affirmation of the unshakeable loyalty of Italian Jews to the Fatherland, His Excellency Mussolini looks me straight in the eye and says with a voice that penetrates straight to my heart: ‘I have never doubted it’. When Il Duce bids us farewell with a Roman salute, I feel an urge to embrace him, as a fascist, as an Italian, but I can’t; and approaching him at his desk I say: ‘Excellency, I would like to shake your hand’. It is not a fascist gesture, but it is a cry from the heart…
Such is The Man that Providence has given to Italy". 
In the 1920s and 1930s Fascist attitudes to the Jewish population began to change. Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and, although Benito Mussolini rejected his racist views, they influenced some leading Fascists in Italy. In 1934 several Jews were arrested in Turin for smuggling in anti-Fascist literature. Ettore Ovazza reacted by doubling his efforts to support the Fascist regime. He founded the newspaper "La nostra bandiera" (Our Flag) reminding Italians of the Jewish sacrifice for Italy in the Great War and attacking the idea that all Jews were Zionists. Taking a leading role in the Jewish community in Turin, Ovazza ensured that all the key positions were held by Fascist supporters. When Mussolini invaded Abyssinia, he immediately volunteered for service, an offer that was turned down probably due to his age (43). Despite the beginnings of anti-semitism, Ovazza was still being rewarded for his patriotism. In 1935 he was honoured for his contribution to the colony of Libya and in the following year was invited at the honour guard at the tomb of the royal family in Superga (Turin).
World War II and death.
In 1938 when a series of anti-semitic laws were passed, the Ovazza family were hit hard. Jews were no longer allowed to marry ‘Aryan’ Italians, to send their children to state schools, to employ Italian servants or be in the army. Much more damaging were the rules that stated they could not employ over 100 people, or own valuable land or buildings. In 1939 Jews were banned from all skilled jobs; shops and cafés displayed signs saying that Jews were no longer welcome. Jewish organisations were disbanded and many Jews converted to Catholicism or emigrated abroad. This put an end to the Ovazza business and banking operations. Ettore Ovazza was expelled from the Fascist party and his brother from the military. 
Ettore's two brothers left the country and advised him to do the same, but he was reluctant to leave the country, hoping that the Duce would alter his views. He wrote an anguished letter to Mussolini, expressing his pain:
"Was it all a dream we nurtured? I can’t believe it. I cannot consider changing religion, because this would be a betrayal - and we are fascists. And so? I turn to You – DUCE – so that in this period, so important for our revolution, you do not exclude that healthy Italian part from the destiny of our Nation."
At the end of the war the SS intercepted and eventually killed him and his family close to the Swiss border.
Adaptations.
His nephew Alain Elkann wrote a fictionalized version of his life.

Hiteswar Saikia was the chief minister of Assam for two terms, first from February 27, 1983 to December 23, 1985 and then from June 30, 1991 to April 22, 1996. He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress. During his first tenure as the chief minister, the famous Anti Foreigners Movement took place under the joint leadership of Sri Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and the late Bhrigu Kumar Phukan, the President and the General Secretary respectively of the All Assam Students Union. Saikia was a stern nationalist and an opponent of militancy in any situation. He is often criticised for crashing the militancy mercilessly in Assam. Saikia was an able administrator. He is credited for improving the education scenario of the state by provincialising a number of educational institutions. Saikia died while in office.
He allegedly orchestrated a number of "surrenders" of ULFA operatives.
Personal life.
Hiteswar Saikia was married to Hemaprabha Saikia.
Controversy regarding Dr Manmohan Singh's residence in Saikia House.
Hiteswar was a close friend and associate of Dr Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India. In fact, Dr Man Mohan Singh became a Rajya Sabha MP from Assam quota by claiming that he was a resident of Assam by producing a house rent receipt from Saikia's wife. According to an affidavit submitted by Dr Man Mohan Singh, the prime minister stays in Saikia's rented house at Sarumotoria by paying a monthly rent of Rupees 700. Manmohan Singh could become a Rajya Sabha member, and thereby a prime minister, chiefly by falsely claiming that he was a resident of Hiteswar Saikia's house in Guwahati.

Brazilian traditional medicine

Traditional Brazilian medicine (Portuguese: Medicina indígena) includes many native South American elements, and imported African ones. It is predominant where indigenous groups and among the black-Native American mestizo population, and in the Northeast coast, nearly all interior regions including Amazon regions, savannahs, rainforest, foothills, and Pantanal. According to Dr. Romulo R. N. Alves, "although Brazil's health system is public...use of traditional remedies and rituals provide an economical way of healing for much of the populace, but that also does not mean that wealthy Brazilians don't seek it out as well. Traditional medicine is a deep part of Brazilian heritage."
The Aruak, Tupi, Yamomami, Krahô, Guarani and other Indians groups are among the native tribes that together with isolated descendants of Africans or Quilombola, and Indians integrated (Caboclo) that are known to almost exclusively practice traditional medicine. Among the plants include edible foods like the cashew, peppers, mangosteen and coconut, but often include inedible parts like the fruits, leaves, husk, bark. Neighboring nations like the Patamona of Guyana also use the cashew.
There is growing interest in Brazilian medicine as the Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical forest in the world, and is home to immense biodiversity, including cures or treatments for many ailments. Japanese scientists have found strong anticancer activity in Brazilian traditional remedies. In one study in 1997 published in" The American Journal of Chinese Medicine", only 122 species existing in Brazil could be related to the Chinese species (or 14.35% of the samples)., which means the vast majority of species are not known to Chinese traditional medicine. Thousands and possibly millions of species remain unstudied and/or susceptible to extinction by habitat destruction.
Examples.
Examples of modern studies of Brazilian medicine the Acai Palm contains antioxidants active against leukemia. Alchornea glandulosa is used to treat assorted skin diseases, diarrhea, inflammations, leprosy and rheuma. Scientific studies have confirmed most of these effects, and also found extracts of certain species to kill off trypanosoma, some bacteria and fungi, and cancer cells.
Some others include psychoactive plants like Ayahuasca Epena and Jurema used in rituals currently being investigated for their potential use in psychiatry.
Markets.
Ver-o-peso is a market in Belém which sells native foods (and remedies), and is more recently a host to the Açaí Fair.

Penang Chinese Town Hall

The Penang Chinese Town Hall () was established in 1881. Chung Keng Quee was the single largest individual donor towards the founding of the town hall and was a prominent president serving from 1881 to 1883.
The main donors for the inauguration of the Penang Chinese Town Hall were the British Colonial Office (10,000 yuan), the Fukien Association (2,000 yuan), Ch'ao-chou Prefecture (1,800 yuan), Ch'iu Lineage Association (1,000 yuan), Hsieh Lineage Association (800 yuan), Cheng Ssu-wen (the fancy name of Chung Keng Quee) (600 yuan), and the Yang Clan of Ying-yuan kung (500 yuan). Two hundred and seventeen more donors contributed between 480 yuan to 10 yuan; a total of about 26,000 yuan was collected.
In June 1905, Chinese merchants in Penang gathered in the Penang Chinese Town Hall, in support of the boycott on American goods, joining Singapore and China in putting pressure on the American government to improve its immigration policy towards the Chinese.
In the election of the office bearer on 9 September 1906, Leong Lok Hing was made General President, Foo Choo Choon, Cheah Meng Chi, Chung Thye Phin and Lim Kek Chuan were made President, and Ng See Sin, Oon Boon Tan, Khaw Joo Tok, Quah Beng, Ong Hun Chong, Koh Leap Teng and Gnoh Lean Tuck were elected Vice President.
On 22 June 2008 Penang Chinese Town Hall chairman, Tan Sri Lim Gait Tong said it was relevant to set up a special committee to establish the actual date it was founded because their records showed conflicting years in which the organisation was set up. He said that although the organisation's constitution stated that it was established in 1875, certain members had claimed that it was set up in 1881 and 1883.

"Sto pregando" ("I'm praying") was the Swiss entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 1994, held in Dublin, Ireland. 
Sung in Italian, it was performed by Lorenzo di Cicco under the stage-name "Duilio", and was composed by Giuseppe Scaramello.
On the night of the contest, it was performed 10th, following Portugal's Sara Tavares with "Chamar a música" and preceding Estonia's Silvi Vrait with "Nagu merelaine". At the close of the voting it had received 15 points, placing 19th of twenty five.
Due to new rules introduced in 1993 Switzerland were relegated from the 1995 contest, and so the song was succeeded as Swiss representative at the 1996 contest by Kathy Leander with "Mon coeur l'aime".

Acer Nethercott

Acer Gary Nethercott (28 November 1977 – 26 January 2013) was a British coxswain, Olympic silver medallist and double Boat Race winner.
Early life.
Nethercott was born in Newmarket, England. Having attended Mark Hall Comprehensive, Harlow, and The Broxbourne School in Hertfordshire, Acer was admitted to University College, Oxford to study Physics and Philosophy as an undergraduate. He subsequently earned a BPhil and then a DPhil in philosophy.
The Boat Race.
Nethercott took up rowing at Oxford as a first year but quickly switched to coxing when it became evident that his body type was more suited to that than pulling an oar. He became a member of both Oxford University Boat Club and Oxford University Women's Boat Club. He earnt his first Blue when he steered the Oxford women's heavyweight blue boat to victory against Cambridge in 2000. The Oxford crew won by 2 lengths, and completed the Henley Boat Race course in a time of 6 minutes and 18 seconds. 
Nethercott then joined the Oxford University Boat Club, steering Isis to victory in 2002. A year later, he stepped up to the Blue Boat, steering Oxford in the closest Boat Race in recent memory. In a thrilling finish Oxford won the 4 mile race by just a foot in a time of 18 minutes and 6 seconds. The race was also notable for it being the first time in history two sets of brothers competed against each other. David Livingston (Oxford) raced against his older brother James, and a last minute call up for Ben Smith (who joined the Cambridge Blue Boat from Goldie hours before the race after the original crew member was injured) meant that he competed against his brother Matthew, the Oxford president.
In 2004, Nethercott won his seat in the Blue Boat after a tense internal competition with Peter Hackworth, the 2002 winning Blue Boat cox who had taken a year out to study in Italy. In a controversial race, in which the two boats clashed blades and the Oxford bowman came off his seat, Oxford lost by 6 lengths in a time of 18 minutes and 17 seconds. 
Nethercott's final Boat Race was in 2005. Both universities had extremely strong intakes that year, with Cambridge boasting several world champions and the Oxford crew including Olympic silver medallist Barney Williams. Oxford won the epic contest by 2 lengths in a time of 16 minutes 42 seconds.
International coxing career.
Nethercott coxed the British Eight from 2005 to 2008, winning bronze at the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich. A year later he won a silver medal at the Olympic Games in Beijing.

Toyota Carina II

The Toyota Carina line of large family cars was introduced in Japan in 1970. This was introduced in Europe in 1971, with A40 and A60 series subsequently appearing soon after their introductions in Japan. In 1984, the A60 series Carina was replaced in the European market by the "Carina II" - essentially a rebranding of the T150 series Toyota Corona launched the previous year in Japan, with some minor alterations to suit the European markets. This trend of Coronas rebadged as Carinas produced for the European market continued for two more generations, with the second Carina II in 1988 and the Carina E in 1992.
First generation (T150).
The T150 series was originally launched in January 1983 in Japan as the Toyota Corona, which brought front wheel drive to the model and also began the alignment of Corona, Carina and Celica platforms. The Carina II was introduced in the UK in April 1984 and other European markets in the same year. This generation was made available in sedan or liftback body styles only. It was essentially the same as the Japanese market Corona T150 with some minor cosmetic changes, namely the rear light clusters which were shortened in width to accommodate for larger European number plates. The T150 Carina introduced in Japan in May 1984, while on the same chassis, used completely different body panels featuring squarer, more aggressive styling. To further complicate matters there were also RWD models of both Carina and Corona available in the Japanese market.
Two carburetted petrol engines (1.6 or 1.8) and one diesel option were available, although the 1.8 was only sold in certain markets. Equipment levels were DX and GL, although following a facelift in December 1985 these changed to XL and SX in some markets. The 1.6 was later offered with the option of a catalytic converter (4A-LC), dropping power to . In August 1985 the 2-litre 2S-E engine was added for select markets. Along with the facelift, a fuel injected version of the 1.8 engine was added for the 1.8 GLi. In Germany, at least, this version was only sold until October 1986.
Second generation - T170 series.
In 1988 the Toyota Carina II was released, based on the Japanese market T170 Corona introduced the previous year. Compared to the Corona, front and rear light clusters, front grille and some trim are different, and the rear number plate recess was moved up from the bumper up to the boot lid. In the generation, beside sedan and liftback body styles, the wagon body style was also available. The car had three engine variants, the 4A-FE and 3S-FE petrol engines, and a 2C diesel engine. Petrol versions were all twin-cam, sixteen-valve inline-four cylinders.
It was well received in the United Kingdom as well as in Nordic countries.
In Europe's largest national auto-market, the T170 sustained the Toyota's reputation for reliability. In 1995 it topped the family car class in a reliability survey of 4-6 year old cars undertaken by the German Automobile Association (ADAC), with 5.6 recorded breakdowns per 1,000 vehicles for four year old Carinas and 12.9 for six year old cars: this compared with 12.8 breakdowns per 1,000 cars for four year old Opel Vectras and 25.6 for six year old Vectras.
Trim levels.
Other markets.
In mainland European markets, the engines (numbers are for catalyzed versions) produced slightly different outputs from British market models. The carburetted 1.6-litre produced at 6,000 rpm, which increased to at 5,800 rpm for fuel injected versions. The 2-litre 3S-FE, never available as an estate, produced a claimed at 5,600 rpm. The 2C diesel provided at 4,700 rpm and was only available with a five-speed manual transmission, whereas the petrol versions could also be had with a four-speed automatic.
In 1991 the Toyota Carina XL Highlife was issued. It utilised a more fuel efficient engine and seats that showed more comfort and the horsepower of the car was increased from 64 to 75. However, these updates had an effect on the weight of the car which rose from . The Carina II was discontinued in 1992 and succeeded by the Toyota Carina E.
In Denmark, these trims were almost identical, except that XL model was slightly more upmarket than UK cars; spec was cognate with Republic of Ireland vehicles. In certain markets, such as Sweden, the Carina II was only available with liftback bodywork and the two-liter petrol engine. In Italy, two-liter Carina II's (petrol and diesel) were only available as liftbacks.

The Killer Is Loose

The Killer Is Loose is a 1956 American crime film noir directed by Budd Boetticher and starring Joseph Cotten, Rhonda Fleming and Wendell Corey. 
Plot.
An employee for a savings and loan company desperate for cash plans and successfully robs a bank as an inside job. At first bank employee Poole (Wendell Corey) is considered a hero during the bank robbery but the police quickly figure out he's involved in the crime. The police catch up with Poole and his young wife at their apartment. Poole's wife is accidentally shot to death by the police during a gunfight. Poole is arrested, convicted and sent to prison for the robbery.
While behind bars, Poole plans his escape and revenge on the policemen that killed his wife, especially the leader of the police raid, Lt. Wagner (Joseph Cotten). Poole figures the best way to extract revenge is to kill Wagner's wife, Lila (Rhonda Fleming).
Critical reaction.
"The New York Times" film critic, Bosley Crowther, found nothing original about the film, calling the lead actors (Cotten and Corey) "first rate" and the crime film "third rate."
Critic Bruce Eder gave a more favorable review and wrote, "Budd Boetticher was a filmmaker of consummate skill and many surprises, as anyone who's seen his best Western dramas can attest. "The Killer Is Loose" (1956) only enhances his reputation in a totally unrelated genre, and in a stylistic mode that's about as far as he could get from his most familiar work. Using a cast of conventional—albeit top-flight—Hollywood professionals, Boetticher takes them out of the studio and puts them into an almost totally location-shot drama, and turns them loose in that naturalistic setting. The result is an array of performances that are as arresting as the script is filled with improbabilities; indeed, the narrative momentum of Boetticher's direction, coupled with a handful of excellent performances, overcomes a script that is just a little too heavy on coincidences to otherwise play true."
More recently, critic Dennis Schwartz, wrote, "A typical 1950s noir, distinguished by its rapid pace and taut script, that delves mainly into the character of the villain—making him out to be someone who went over-the-edge when he couldn't take being ridiculed as a failure, anymore...The suburban atmosphere and the no-nonsense style of telling the story add to the blandness of the story and the failure to elicit anything out of the ordinary to the build-up of the suspense that comes with the climax. The result is a watchable film which could be seen for the sense of nostalgia of the 1950s it evokes, a time when it was more receptive for noir to work as well as it does."

Dan Suciu is a full professor of computer science at the University of Washington. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1995 under the supervision of Val Tannen. After graduation, he was a principal member of the technical staff at AT&T Labs until he joined the University of Washington in 2000. Suciu does research in data management, with an emphasis on Web data management and managing uncertain data. He is a co-author of an influential book on managing semistructured data.
His research work on developing query languages and algorithms for managing semistructured and XML data has been highly influential in the data management research community. He was helped shape XML query languages such as XML-QL and Strudel, which influenced the subsequent design of the standard XQuery language. His work on XML-relational mapping in the context of the STORED and SilkRoute projects built the foundations of the standard techniques that are now used for storing XML data in commercial database systems. His work on XMill, an XML compressor, won the best paper award at SIGMOD 2000, the main research conference in data management, and was seminal to a substantial amount of follow-up work. At the 2010 Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, Suciu and his co-authors Victor Vianu and Tova Milo won the Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award for their work ten years prior on type checking for XML transformation languages. In 2011 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. His current work on probabilistic databases was at the outset of a revival of interest in this area.
He lives in Seattle, WA, with his wife and two children.

USNS Range Recoverer (T-AG-161)

USNS "Range Recoverer" (T-AG-161/T-AGM-2/YFRT-524) was a missile range instrumentation ship responsible for providing radar and/or telemetry track data on missiles launched from American launch sites.
She was built during World War II as U.S. Army U.S. Army "FS-278", and was acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1960 as miscellaneous auxiliary and was converted into a missile tracking ship. She continued her missile tracking until being placed out of service in 1972, at which time she was reclassified range tender "YFRT-524", and eventually scrapped in 1974.
U.S. Army.
"FS-278" was built for the Army in 1944 by the Wheeler Shipbuilding Corp., Whitestone, New York. "FS-278" was a Coast Guard-manned Army vessel commissioned at New York on 25 November 1944 departing New York on 17 December 1944, for the Southwest Pacific where she operated at Peleliu, Palawan, etc. during the war. Command transferred to LT D. W. Engle, USCGR on 25 June 1945. From 28 August until 20 September "FS-278" transported General Douglas MacArthur's defense planning staff for the Philippine Islands. She was decommissioned 3 October 1945.
U.S. Navy.
The ship was acquired by the Navy in April 1960; converted by Pacific Ship Repair, San Francisco, California; and placed in service with the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) as "T-AG-161" on 22 June 1960, Capt. John Strom in command.
Missile tracking activities.
Named "Range Recoverer" on 12 July, she reported to the Pacific Missile Range in August 1960. On 27 November she was reclassified a missile range instrumentation ship and designated T-AGM-2. She is equipped with telemetry, data processing and radio instruments as well as recovery facilities to retrieve nose cones.
Manned by a Civil Service crew of the Military Sea Transportation Service, "Range Recoverer" served first as a telemetry and recovery ship on the Pacific Missile Range where she launched, tested, and evaluated the Regulus missile; then, in July 1962, shifted to Little Creek, Virginia, to support the NASA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia. NASA technical party operators used on board equipment, including helix antennas, data recording systems and a communications suite with direction finders to locate and recover payloads. There she replaced two T-1 tankers, "Dumont" and "Whitlock", damaged during a storm.
Since that time, into 1970, "Range Recoverer" operated out of Little Creek primarily between Wallops Island and the splash down area near Bermuda.
Other services provided.
During the mid-sixties the ship traveled to Greece for coordinated research on a solar eclipse and was visited by the Greek royal family. NASA, assisting other government agencies, has also loaned "Range Recoverer" to the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, to conduct oceanographic surveys off the coast of Virginia.
Final disposition.
"Range Recoverer" was placed out-of-service in 1972 and reclassified as range tender "YFRT-524". She was struck from the Navy List (unknown date) and sold for scrap 1 November 1974.

The 2008 version also featured in a Season One episode of "Gossip Girl", as well as its soundtrack OMFGG and was used as part of the Fox Broadcasting Company's fall 2008 ad campaign. The song also appears in EA's "NHL 09" and for the TV spots for "50/50".
The music video premiered in early May 2008. It is a horror movie spoof, showing the band members missing several body parts. This video also includes a short audio clip from a remixed version of "Leader" playing before the actual song kicks in.
In early 2008, "Rolling Stone" gave the song and its accompanying album a rating of 3.5/5 stars, commenting "Raise the Dead gives its macabre subjects (and its lighter ones) an oddly upbeat spin. Jumping from Bowie glam to disco punk, the band tosses in synths, arch backing coos and riffing saxes for songs that are both expansive and strange." It was number 71 on "Rolling Stone"s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008.
Music video.
The music video for the song, directed by Mike Myerburg, features the band performing in a log cabin. Throughout the video, band members are seen running through the woods outside, only to have their limbs hacked off by an unseen killer. As each band member is killed, the band shots show that member now missing from the performance until only singer Alex Greenwald is left. However, the limbs that had been hacked off by the killer come back to life to play the rest of the song with Greenwald.

Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce

Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, OD (born December 27, 1986) is a Jamaican track and field sprinter. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Fraser-Pryce ascended to prominence in the 2008 Olympic Games, when, at 21 years old, the then unknown athlete became the first Caribbean woman to win 100 m gold at the Olympics. In 2012, she successfully defended her 100m title, becoming the third woman to win two consecutive 100m events at the Olympics.
Fraser-Pryce won the 100m gold medal in the 2009 IAAF World Championships, becoming the second female sprinter to hold both World and Olympic 100 m titles simultaneously (after Gail Devers). In 2013 she also became the first female sprinter to win gold medals in the 100 m, 200 m and 4x100 m in a single world championship. Nicknamed the "pocket rocket" for her petite frame (she stands 5 feet tall) and explosive starts, she is ranked fourth on the list of the fastest 100 m female sprinters of all time, with a personal best of 10.70 seconds, set in Kingston, Jamaica in 2012.
Career.
2008 Beijing Olympics.
Fraser, who trained for the Olympics with teammate Asafa Powell, became the first Jamaican woman in history to win an Olympic gold medal in the 100 m sprint. In her first round heat, she placed first in a time of 11.35 to advance to the second round. She then improved her time to 11.06 seconds, finishing first in her heat. In the semifinals Fraser again finished in front, outsprinting Kerron Stewart and Muna Lee in 11.00 seconds.
In the final, Jamaican sprinters finished in the top three positions in the race, with a photographic tie for second place by Sherone Simpson and Kerron Stewart. (Both women were awarded silver medals; no bronze medal was awarded.) Fraser's time of 10.78 seconds was a personal best and 0.20 seconds faster than her Jamaican teammates. Fraser's Olympic time was the second-fastest 100 m ever recorded by a Jamaican woman, a mere 0.04 seconds (1/25 of a second) shy of Merlene Ottey's 10.74 record.
Together with Sheri-Ann Brooks, Aleen Bailey and Veronica Campbell-Brown, Fraser also took part in the 4 x 100 m relay. In its first round heat, Jamaica placed first in front of Russia, Germany and China. The Jamaica relay's time of 42.24 seconds was the first time overall out of sixteen participating nations. With this result, Jamaica qualified for the final, replacing Brooks and Bailey with Simpson and Stewart. Jamaica did not finish the race due to a mistake in the baton exchange.
2009 Berlin World Championships.
Fraser took the 100 m Jamaican title in June 2009, winning with a world-leading time of 10.88 s against a strong headwind (−1.5 m/s). This made her the number one Jamaican qualifier for the 2009 World Championships.
Fraser took full advantage, holding off a late surge (and personal best) from compatriot Kerron Stewart, who had a slow start, to win by two one-hundredths of a second in a time of 10.73. – the fourth fastest time in the event's history and a Jamaican national record.
She later ran the second leg on the Jamaican 4x 100 m relay team. Fraser ran an outstanding back-straight, outrunning athletes like Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas, Anne Mollinger of Germany and Kelly-Ann Baptiste of Trinidad and Tobago, with a successful change over to Aleen Bailey. The Jamaican team eventually claimed the gold medal in a time of 42.06 with the Bahamas claiming silver and Germany claiming bronze.
2012 London Olympics.
Leading into the 2012 London Olympic Games, Fraser-Pryce improved her national record in the 100 m to 10.70 at the Jamaican Olympic Trials. At the Games, Fraser-Pryce successfully defended her 100 m title, beating American Carmelita Jeter into second place in the final with a time of 10.75 seconds. Fellow Jamaican Veronica Campbell-Brown took bronze.
Fraser-Pryce went on to take silver in the 200 m in a personal best time of 22.09 behind Allyson Felix. She also earned a second silver medal in the 4×100 m relay.
2013 Moscow World Championships.
Fraser-Pryce won the 100 m race in a time of 10.71 which gave her the world lead. It was her second World Championship in that competition after having won the title in 2009. With teammate and title-defender Veronica Campbell-Brown absent because of a doping ban and main competitor Allyson Felix withdrawing halfway in the final race due to injury, Fraser-Pryce won the 200m title in a time of 22.17. It was her first major title over that distance. As the final runner of the 4 x 100 m relay team she won her third gold medal of the competition with teammates Carrie Russell, Kerron Stewart and Schillonie Calvert. Their time of 41.29 also set a new championship record.
Fraser-Pryce and fellow Jamaican athlete Usain Bolt swept the sprinting events for their respective genders at the meet, winning three gold medals each in the 100m, 200m, and 4 x 100m races.
Drug Ban.
Fraser-Pryce served a six-month ban from athletics after a urine sample taken at the 2010 Shanghai Diamond League meeting was found to contain a non-banned narcotic, Oxycodone. She claimed to have been suffering from toothache, and her coach, Stephen Francis, persuaded her to take a painkiller he was taking for kidney stones. Fraser-Pryce said the painkiller contained the drug, but she was unaware of this. However, Fraser-Pryce has acknowledged responsibility for her actions, "I'm a professional athlete. One who's supposed to set examples – so whatever it is I put in my body it's up to me to take responsibility for it and I have done that".
Special Awards.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce first won the Golden Cleats Award for female Athlete of the Year in 2010. Fraser-Pryce was awarded because of her gold medal performance at the 2009 Berlin IAAF World Championships in the 100 meters and a gold medal in the 4 x 100 meter relay as well. For Fraser-Pryce's outstanding accomplishments in last year's 2012 London Olympic Games, Fraser-Pryce won the Golden Cleats Award for female Athlete of the Year for the second time. The awards ceremony is sponsored by the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association in January 2013. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is the third woman in history to repeat as the 100 meter Olympic Champion from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and also the 2012 London Olympics. As a result, she was awarded female Athlete of the Year in January 2013 for her gold medal performance at the 2012 London Olympic Games in the women's 100 meters, her silver medal performance in the 200 meters and helped the Jamaican 4 x 100 meter relay team win a silver medal. In accepting her award, she exclaimed, "It was a long year, as it was my final year in college, but it was a very important year for me as I wanted to repeat my title and wanted to win. I have to give God thanks for everything that happened last year.".
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the fastest women on earth, competed with Britain’s Jessica Ennis, for the Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year Award. The award recognizes sporting achievement during the year 2012.Especially recognizing successful performances at the 2012 London Olympic Games. The winners are determined by votes made up of 46 of the greatest sportsmen and sportswomen of all time. The awards ceremony was televised on March 11, 2013. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce lost the award to Jessica Ennis, the gold medalist for the women’s heptathlon in London 2012, who also won the top honour, and the Laureus Sports Award.
Off the track.
Fraser was named as the first UNICEF National Goodwill Ambassador for Jamaica on 22 February 2010. On 23 February 2010, she was named Grace Goodwill Ambassador for Peace for 2010 in a partnership with Grace Foods and not-for-profit Organisation PALS (Peace and Love in Society).
In January 2011 she married long-term boyfriend Jason Pryce, changing her name to Fraser-Pryce. She is a committed Christian.

Queensland Energy Resources

Queensland Energy Resources Limited (QERL) is an Australian oil shale mining and shale oil extraction company with the headquarter in Brisbane. It is the developer of the Stuart (Yarwun) and McFarlane oil shale projects.
History.
Queensland Energy Resources Limited was formed in February 2004, when it acquired the assets of the Stuart Oil Shale Project from receivers of the project's former developer, Southern Pacific Petroleum N.L. On 21 July 2004, QER announced that the plant would be shut down for economic and environmental reasons. From 2005 to 2007, oil shale from its deposits were tested in a pilot plant facility in Rifle, Colorado owned by Shale Technologies. On 14 August 2008, Queensland Energy Resources announced that it had shunned the Alberta Taciuk Processor (ATP) oil shale processing technology in favor of the Paraho II technology and that the ATP technology-based plant was being dismantled, and obsolete components were being sold. On 24 August 2008, the Queensland Government announced an oil-shale mining moratorium over the company-owned McFarlane deposit for 20 years.
On 10 May 2010, the company announced a plan for construction of a small-scale shale-oil demonstration plant at Yarwun (the site of the Stuart Oil Shale Project). The new plant produced its first oil on 6 October 2011.
Operations.
Queensland Energy Resources holds mining tenement rights to several oil shale deposits in Queensland, Australia. Two major resources are Stuart, located at Yarwun, Queensland, and McFarlane, located near Proserpine. The McFarlane oil shale resource, one of Australia's largest, remains under a 20-year mining moratorium. QER operates a visitor's center at the Yarwun site and is completing a technology demonstration plant based on the Paraho II Technology.

Neverender

Neverender was a four-night concert series performed by Coheed and Cambria. It took place in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and London, and consisted of one of the band's four studio albums being played in full each night, telling the story of the concept in sequence according to each album. "Neverender" is a song from their first album, "The Second Stage Turbine Blade".
Announcement.
In early July 2008, the band's official website and MySpace featured a teaser poster with the dragonfly artwork for an event called Neverender. A few days later, the event was unveiled to the public. Four days before all of the tickets went on sale there was a presale of special "VIP" tickets. These were 10% of the total number of tickets for the concerts. They sold out within minutes of going on sale.
In early August, the band's official website along with their MySpace featured two flags on the same Neverender poster. Two days later it was announced that Neverender would also have shows in Chicago and London. The film Night of the Living Dead was played in the background on night four.
Neverender: The Children of the Fence Box Set.
On March 24, 2009 a box set was released containing footage from all nights of Neverender from the New York City dates. It contains a CD and DVD of each night of the concert, as well as a documentary entitled The Fiction Will See The Real.
London cancellation.
The band were forced to cancel their show at the London Astoria on Tuesday December 2, due to a power cut caused by road maintenance outside the building and the accidental severance of a major power conduit. As a result the performance of was rescheduled for Friday December 5.
Initially, the VIP Meet and Greet and Acoustic performance were moved to the Friday, but as a fair number of fans were unable to make the new date, lead singer Claudio Sanchez announced on-stage that the Thursday would remain the same and Friday date would feature a cover song set including music by Claudio Sanchez's one-man side project The Prize Fighter Inferno.
Neverender 12%.
On February 26, 2009 an exclusive live EP was released only at Hot Topic stores, which contains 6 tracks pulled from the upcoming Neverender set.

School of Irish Learning

The School of Irish Learning was a center for Irish studies in Dublin founded in 1903 by Kuno Meyer, who talked of "the necessity of bringing the revivalist movement into direct and intimate relations with scholarship, to provide an avenue for every student of Irish to the higher regions of study and research, to crown the whole edifice by a revival of native scholarship, and thus to bring about a second golden age of Irish learning." The School's Honorary Secretary was R. I. Best, and among the first students were Osborn Bergin and T. F. O'Rahilly. The School published books on language and history which remain standard textbooks for undergraduate courses in Irish, and in 1904 it instituted the scholarly journal "Ériu", of which Meyer was the editor.The principal object of the School was to provide a thorough professional grounding in linguistics, philology, and textual studies for students who had an advanced competence in Irish and Celtic languages. Instruction was for the most part organized in the form of intensive Summer Schools which were conducted by distinguished scholars invited from overseas, e.g. by Holger Pedersen, Henry Sweet, and Rudolf Thurneysen. John Strachan had a more central rôle, almost equal to that of Kuno Meyer himself. Because its activities were organized in this way, and because it had to depend on uncertain sources of funding, the School from the outset had the character of a temporary expedient... Inevitably, the School would become largely redundant once effective undergraduate and postgraduate training in Irish and Celtic languages had been properly established in Irish Universities...The Governors and Trustees applied to have the School incorporated into the Royal Irish Academy; the terms of incorporation were agreed on in 1925, the Academy undertaking to maintain the School's publications in print, and in 1926 the School ended its existence.

Tibet Fund

The Tibet Fund is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in New York, NY. Founded in 1981 under the auspices of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, The Tibet Fund is the primary funding organization for the health, education, refugee rehabilitation, cultural preservation and economic development programs that enable Tibetans in exile and in their homeland to sustain their language, culture and national identity.
The work of The Tibet Fund is guided by the following priorities:
• To support health care, education, refugee rehabilitation, religious and cultural preservation, community and economic development programs that enable Tibetans to thrive in today’s world;
• To help the Central Tibetan Administration to revitalize the Tibetan settlements in India, Nepal and Bhutan;
• To ensure that Tibetan culture and identity remain a vibrant part of our global heritage;
• To enable donors to connect with individual Tibetan children, monks, nuns and the elderly;
• To raise awareness about the Tibetan people’s achievements over the past 50 years.
The story of The Tibet Fund is the story of the Tibetan people’s perseverance and resourcefulness through decades of upheaval and exile. It is the story of survival and the preservation of culture and national identity.
The organization works closely with the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) departments of Finance, Health, Education, Home, and Religion and Culture in Dharamsala, India to implement programs for the more than 120,000 refugees living in settlements and scattered communities in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. As Tibetans continue to escape from Tibet and join the exile community, the resources of the already overcrowded settlement system are being stretched to the limit. Employment opportunities in the settlements are scarce, forcing families to leave their homes for months at a time to seek alternative sources of income. Out of concern for the long-term sustainability of the exile community, The Tibet Fund is working to support programs that will strengthen the refugees’ economic prospects and promote community cohesiveness.
The Tibet Fund has administered a major annual grant from the US Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration for humanitarian aid since 1991 and a State Department-funded Tibetan Scholarship Program (TSP) since 1989. The TSP has enabled 380 Tibetan students to study in some of the best American universities and colleges and return to serve the exile community as officials in the CTA, and as educators, health workers, business leaders and heads of local community-based organizations. Both of these grant programs are having a significant impact on the refugees’ ability to thrive and create a resettlement model that is heralded as an outstanding example for other populations facing long-term displacement from their homelands.
In addition, with the support of many individuals and foundations, The Tibet Fund has funded numerous infrastructure and training projects — housing, computer labs, solar energy, agriculture and irrigation, and sanitation — over the years that have improved conditions and upgraded the technological resources and professional skills in the settlements and schools.
In 1994, The Tibet Fund initiated the Tibet Assistance Program to address the unmet health, educational and economic development needs of Tibetans in Tibet. Working with international and Tibetan grassroots organizations, it supports orphanages, eye clinics and remote eye camps, provide emergency relief for natural disasters and promote cultural and educational programs that are greatly improving the quality of life of thousands of marginalized Tibetans. The Tibet Fund offers scholarships for college-bound Tibetan youth who lack the resources to pursue higher education in Tibet and it has administered an English language and professional training program in Tibet and the US with support from the US Department of State.

Dickie Pride

Dickie Pride (21 October 1941 — 26 March 1969), born Richard Charles Kneller, was a British rock and roll singer. He was one of Larry Parnes' stable of pop music stars, who did not enjoy as successful a career as most of his contemporaries.
Life and career.
Pride was born at 74 Parchmore Road, Thornton Heath, Surrey. He attended John Newnham Secondary school before he visited the School of Church Music in Croydon, where a career as an opera singer was suggested. Later on, Pride was a member of a skiffle group, the Semi-Tones.
He had several poorly paid jobs. Russ Conway heard him performing at the Castle public house in Tooting, South London. Conway recommended him to Larry Parnes, who immediately signed him. Parnes gave him his stage name, Dickie Pride. At 16, he gave his first concert, as Dickie Pride at the Kilburn Gaumont State Cinema, which was then the biggest cinema in the United Kingdom. The music magazine" Record Mirror" stated that "he ripped it up from the start" and that the theatre shook so much during his performance that he should be known "The sheik of shake".
This was followed by tours, television and, in March 1959, the first single "Slippin' and Slidin'" (a cover of the song made famous by Little Richard). He also performed in 'The Big Beat Show' at Southend with Marty Wilde, Billy Fury, Terry Dene, Johnny Gentle, Duffy Power and Sally Kelly. Despite his live performances, with most of his subsequent recordings, commercially Pride was far below expectations. The only single of Pride's that ever made it into the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart - "Primrose Lane" appeared in October 1959 for only one week in 28th place.
Television producer, Jack Good had seen Pride sing in Southend. In April 1960 the first edition of Good's rock and roll TV show, "Wham!" was shown on ABC-TV, and included Pride. The guitarist, Albert Lee, had his first professional stage appearance as an accompanist of Pride.
Pride was very successful during live performances but had difficulty transferring this success to his recordings. In 1961 Parnes attempted to reposition Pride as a mainstream singer, and he made an album of 'Tin Pan Alley' standards with Eric Jupp and his Orchestra, called "Pride Without Prejudice". However, the record sold very poorly and Pride was subsequently dropped by Parnes. He later formed several other groups including the Guvnors and the Sidewinders.
In addition to mental health problems, Pride was under the influence of drugs, including heroin. In 1962 he married, and in 1965, his son was born. His musical career however started to decline. In 1967, he was submitted to a psychiatric clinic, where a lobotomy was performed.
On 26 March 1969, Pride was found dead in his bed. He died at the age of 27 due to an overdose of sleeping pills. Fellow Parnes' artists such as Billy Fury and Joe Brown stated that Pride had been the most talented singer of Parnes' artists.
In 1999, Charles Langley wrote the stage play, "Pride With Prejudice", about Pride's tragic life.

Runcorn to Latchford Canal

The Runcorn to Latchford Canal (also known as the Old Quay Canal or locally as "Old Quay Cut" or "Black Bear Canal") ran from Runcorn, Cheshire to the Latchford area of Warrington, then in the historic county of Lancashire, England. It connected the Mersey and Irwell Navigation to the River Mersey at Runcorn.
History.
The canal was built to bypass the shallow stretches of the Mersey at Fiddlers Ferry. It extended for , ending to the east of Runcorn Gap close to the centre of the township of Runcorn, and cost £48,000. At Latchford, it joined the Mersey at a lock which was located above Howley Weir. At its terminus a dock was built which became part of the Port of Runcorn. The canal was built under powers embodied in the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Act (1720) which permitted new cuts to be made without the necessity of further recourse to Parliament. It opened in July 1804. 
The canal and the Mersey and Irwell Navigation were bought out by the Bridgewater Canal Company in 1844. The new owners invested little in the canal and its condition gradually grew worse. They in turn were bought out by the Manchester Ship Canal Company in the 1890s, who particularly wanted ownership of the Runcorn to Latchford Canal, as the ship canal would use the same course for part of its route. Much of the western end of the canal, including the docks at Runcorn, disappeared when the much larger ship canal was built. The eastern end fared rather better, as the section between Twenty Steps Bridge and Latchford Lock was retained. A new lock, called Twenty Steps Lock, was built where the old canal left the course of the ship canal, and it was used to supply tanneries at Howley with hides which were imported from Argentina, and this trade continued until the 1960s. This section was called the Black Bear Canal, and it ceased to be used after the tanneries closed.
The canal as built had a locks at both ends, both of which dropped into the river. As it had no natural water supply, and water was lost every time a boat passed through a lock, a feeder was built from just above Paddington Lock on the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The water was then carried across the Mersey in an aqueduct, which also acted as a footbridge, and followed the banks of the Mersey to arrive at Latchford Lock. It emptied into the canal just to the south of the lock. When the Black Bear Canal section was created, Twenty Steps Lock also rose from the ship canal, and so the feature was retained. Latchford Lock was usually known as Manor Lock after the construction of the ship canal, as the locks immediately above its junction with the Black Bear Canal were called Latchford Locks.
Route.
The route diagram shows the canal as it was in the 1880s, with some later additions, including the points at which the route of the Manchester Ship Canal destroyed the canal, and features such as Twenty Steps Lock, which was built to connect a section of the original canal to the ship canal.
Traces of the canal still exist in Wigg Island and in Moore Nature Reserve. The route of the canal forms the basis of the designated "Linear Park" that runs parallel to the river Mersey at Lower Walton and is clearly visible looking west from Chester Road (A5060) whilst standing on the road bridge over the River Mersey. In the distance is the "Twelve Arches Bridge" where arch number 3 (counted south to north) passes over where the canal would have passed. The largely dried out canal basin can be traced westwards after the bridge towards Moore Nature Reserve and then Runcorn. The canal passes east under the A5060 where it joins the Manchester Ship Canal at Latchford Locks (site of the proposed Port of Warrington). Thereafter it re-emerges in Stockton Heath just past the London Road Swing Bridge (A49) where it runs north-easterly passing under Loushers Lane Bridge until eventually passing under Knutsford Road at the site of the former Black Bear Public House. The course of the canal runs a short distance then to terminate and re-join the River Mersey close to Kingsway North Bridge.
The Wigg Island nature reserve covers and was opened in April 2002. It is named after the Wigg Chemical Works, set up in the 1860s to extract copper from ore. The works were used to produce mustard gas in the Second World War, and closed in the 1960s. While the canal was operational, a regular problem was the leaching of highly acidic effluent into the canal. Remediation work to reclaim the brownfield site has included the construction of a filter system which passes the water through a limestone-filled channel. This ensures that the water in the length of canal which crosses the site is safe and suitable for wildlife.

Arifin Bey

Arifin Bey (5 March 1925 – 2 September 2010) was born in Padang Panjang, West Sumatra in the Minangkabau heartland of West Sumatra, one year before the Communist revolt in 1926, and three years before the participants of Youth Conference in 1928 avowed themselves to be one people, the Indonesian people, constituting one nation, Indonesia, with one language Bahasa Indonesia. They were years of growing political and social unrest during which Dutch rule became increasingly oppressive.
He was one of eight siblings, five girls and three boys. His father was a school inspector in the Dutch administration. Among friends and colleagues, he was known as Buyung, thus his Dutch colleagues referred to him as Mijnheer Bij,-Mr.B. Bij was Indonesianised to Bey, and adopted as the family name of his children. 
Arifin was highly intelligent, and qualified for entry into the Dutch educational stream. It was said of him that he was never without a book. He kept up with world events, and assembled files of newspaper clippings. He was politically engaged, and a member of the Young Sumatra Association. At the age of 16, his public speaking activities had him investigated by the police, his father interrogated, their home searched, and his newspaper clippings confiscated. The headmaster of the Dutch school he attended recognised his ability saved him from any further escalation of punishment, and arranged for him to continue teacher-training studies in Bandung.
The Japanese Occupation in 1942 interrupted his formal education. But he studied privately, despite the chaos, and began the study of Japanese that was to become the foundation of his future career. He was selected by the Japanese to study in Japan as a potential leader in Indonesia when the war was won. Ironically, Tokyo was thought to be too dangerous for his cohort of Indonesian and other students from Southeast Asia, and they were sent to study at the Hiroshima University of Arts and Sciences. Hiroshima up to that time had not been heavily bombed.
He went to Japan as a scholarship student during the Pacific War, when Indonesia was under Japanese occupation, and found himself in Hiroshima in 1945, when the city was hit by an atomic bomb. 
Of the five hundred students in the university lecture theatre when the bomb exploded, only he and a Thai student survived. Physically he was not severely injured, but later developed radiation sickness. He remained in Japan for some time, and by chance at a railway station, saw a Japanese woman hassled by some American soldiers. He extricated her from the melee, to her great relief. His Japanese by then was so fluent that at first she thought he was Japanese. Discovering he was an Indonesian, she took him home to meet her parents and siblings. Two of her brothers were doctors, and recognising he was suffering from radiation sickness, arranged hospital treatment for him. The family virtually adopted him, and shared in caring for him, this twenty year old, far from home. Later he was to marry the Japanese woman he had helped. It was a long and happy marriage, until she died of cancer.
His knowledge of English, gained at the Dutch school, his mastery of Japanese, and his outstanding general ability and social skills led him to the Department of Foreign Affairs when he returned to Indonesia. He was sent to America, and in 1954 was the first Indonesia to serve in a staff appointment at the United Nations in New York. He continued to study, gaining a Bachelor’s and then a Master’s degree at a New York University. He returned to Indonesia, and after serving for two years as assistant to the Director of the Indonesian Institute of the Sciences, was sponsored by the Ford Foundation for a Ph.D at Georgetown University. In 1961, he completed his studies at Georgetown University, earning a Ph.D. in international political science through a dissertation on dialogue in search of consensus in the Indonesian political process. 
On returning to Indonesia he was appointed editor of the semi-official English language daily,"Indonesian Herald", He was the editor from 1961 to 1967. During the years of Guided Democracy amid the increasing tensions leading to the attempted coup in 1965, it was an exposed position. Skilful ideological navigation was necessary to avoid disaster. He survived, though later it was rumoured he had compromised his integrity.
He was assigned as a councillor to the Indonesian Embassy in Tokyo in 1967. This presented a new challenge. He had then been away from Japan for 17 years, but it was a position for which he was uniquely qualified by his knowledge of Japanese, his personal experience of a cataclysmic event in Japanese history, his work in the United Nations, his academic achievements, and his work in journalism. It was the gateway to a field that he would make his own. He realised that the only way into the world of Japanese thinking and acting was through the Japanese language, and he devoted himself to deepening his knowledge of it. None of the other members of the Indonesian Embassy staff at that time knew Japanese well, and so for knowledge of Japanese affairs were dependent on information filtered through English language press. This was inadequate, so he prepared every morning a digest of Japanese news from the Japanese media for distribution to his colleagues. 
He founded an Association of Japanese speaking diplomats. It met for lunch monthly, invited Japanese guests to give lectures in Japanese, and for the length of the meeting, only Japanese was spoken. The speakers included opinion leaders, but not all was high seriousness. One was a clairvoyant was responsibility was to advise business executives on what business deals to enter and what to avoid, and what names to give to products, even cars, so that they would sell. A highlight in this period was acting as interpreter for President Suharto on his state visit to Japan in 1968 when he addressed the Foreign Correspondents Club.
This experience, the knowledge, competence and confidence he gained in speaking and writing Japanese, and his people skills, were to wean him from the world of diplomacy into that of academe. He was invited to give radio talks and appear on television programs, thanks to which he became widely known as Bey San. He received invitations to give seminars, and to teach at the Area Studies Program at Tsukuba University, where he was required to lecture in both Japanese and English. In doing so, he had a key role in developing Southeast Asian Studies in Japan as a Southeast Asian fluent in Japanese.
He returned to Jakarta in 1970. But despite the quality of his work in Japan, rumours that he had sailed too close to the wind in his editorship of the Indonesian Herald persisted. Gestapu-ism at that time hung in the air much as Macarthy-ism in America a decade earlier. Thus it was felt expedient to loan him to the think tank Research Documentation and Analysis (REDA) an Indonesian military-supported research organization, to report from Tokyo. The Director, Zulkifli Lubis, who had in fact been imprisoned by Soekarno, decided to appoint a resident correspondent in Tokyo, and chose Arifin. The then Foreign Minister Adam Malik granted him ‘extended leave without pay’, and he left again for Japan. A new stage in his life had begun. He was on the road to a new career. And it was now that the key words in the title of his Ph.D. thesis for Georgetown, Dialogue and Consensus, concepts which had had so central a place in his mind and thinking, began to bear fruit.
In addition to his work as ‘Foreign Correspondent’ he was in demand at Japanese Universities. 
Between 1972 – 74, he served as a Visiting Lecturer at Sophia University and the International Christian University, teaching courses on Western Political Thought and Intercultural Communication respectively. In 1976 he was appointed as Visiting Professor at Tsukuba University, a position which he held until 1984. The Iranian Islamic revolution in 1979, transformed his position and his role. The Japanese were flabbergasted, but did not take too seriously the statement attributed to Kissinger, that the evolution would only last six weeks. Arifin was at the time one of the very few scholars of Islamic faith in Japan who could lecture on Islam as a religion and culture in Japanese. And he was inundated with invitations to write articles or give talks on Islam. Alongside his courses on Modern Japanese Politics Domestic and International, he developed introductory courses on Islam, and on the Religions and Cultures of Southeast Asia.
In 1984 he received a commendation from the Japanese Ministry for Foreign Affairs for ‘Meritorious Services in Culture and Information’. In the same year he resigned from Tsukuba university in 1984, planning to use his unique knowledge and experience of Japan to develop Japanese Studies at tertiary institutions in Indonesia. First he spent a year the Bung Hatta University in Padang. While there, the Japanese Ambassador came to Padang to confer on him the Japanese Foreign Ministry’s award ‘for distinguished service in the field of public information and cultural understanding’. In 1985 he moved to the Universitas Nasional Jakarta, to founded The Japan Research Centre, which he directed until 1987. 
But somehow things do not work out as hoped. Japan called again, and he was appointed Visiting Professor at Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba, where he taught until 1995. In 1991, he was presented the Japanese Imperial Medal of The Order of Sacred Treasure, Gold Rays and Neck Ribbon. This was an award from the Emperor, rarely awarded to foreigners. 
Part of the citation is as follows:
"… during your more than twenty years’ stay in Japan, you have shown a deep understanding of this country and its people …As an international political scientist who understands our culture and our way of thinking, you are uniquely positioned among Indonesian intellectuals. …You have served as a kind of moral compass for Japanese diplomacy towards Asia, and for Japanese comprehension of fellow Asian peoples. You have contributed to the promotion of mutual understanding between Japan and Indonesia and to the spread of international political studies in Japan." 
At the age of 70, in 1995, he decided to return home, to Indonesia. But by way of a detour was appointed for a three year term to a position as Visiting Professor at the University of Malaya, teaching the History of Japanese Thought and the Making of Modern Japan.
Only in 1998 did he make his home again in Jakarta. There he devoted his energies to a different level of the educational spectrum. With his daughter Mulyati Bey, he established an Islamic kindergarten, "Taman Kanak-Kanak Islam Arif Mulya" in the Jakarta suburb of Bukit Modern. It is an institution that is highly regarded, and continues to thrive. In the year 2000, on his 75th birthday, he added the final touch to his career by performing the Hajj with his daughter.
He wrote widely and copiously, although most of his publications are in Japanese. He did however in 2002 publish a book of collected essays, Beyond Civilizational Dialogue, in part autobiographical, part reflective on global issues of politics and culture, in part on the role of Islam in society. The late Professor Nurcholish Madjid wrote a preface. It has many vivid anecdotes. One is of the pains of studying Japanese; another is of Hatta being offered pork at New York state luncheon; yet another is of the American Visiting American Professor in 1955 who urged him to write a Ph.D thesis on the side Indonesia should take in the Cold War. He replied that the ideologies of Democracy and Communism were not his concern. He was more concerned with issues of personal and national identity. The Professor replied, ‘The whole American mission is to implant democracy in the four corners of the world. Even if you do not want it, we will push it down your throat for your own good’. But Arifin, in his father’s foot-steps stood by his convictions. He wrote on Dialogue and Consensus. 
Back in Indonesia, he remained active, administering the Kindergarten, lecturing, writing, reading widely, and above all fulfilling with love and care all his responsibilities as head of his large extended family, whether in Jakarta or Padang. He was the very model of a "Minangkabau Mamak". He did not forget his family in Australia, nor they him, and they were represented at his eightieth birthday five years ago. He was a person of total dedication: to his Islamic Faith, to his ideals as an educationalist in the widest sense of the word, and to the family that was always a central part of his life.

Mutants (Judge Dredd storyline)

Mutants are the subject of a number of stories in the "Judge Dredd" science-fiction series published in British comics "2000 AD" and the "Judge Dredd Megazine". Mutants are genetically-flawed, physically deformed people who are the subject of prejudice and apartheid in the 22nd century. Although they have appeared in "Judge Dredd" since the strip's earliest stories in 1977, a major story arc beginning with "Mutants in Mega-City One" in June 2007 and ending with "Tour of Duty" in July 2010 dealt specifically with their struggle against apartheid in Dredd's city, Mega-City One.
Background.
Mutants are "de novo" mutations created by radiation or radioactive contamination following the Atomic Wars in 2070. Their genetic mutations (which are inherited by their children) cause them to exhibit bizarre physical deformities. They first appeared in "2000 AD" #4 (1977), described as raiders from outside the city, in the "wilderness from the Atomic Wars." Another early issue revealed that mutants have been banned from the city, on grounds that " hate ordinary people because they themselves are warped". However "The Cursed Earth" (1978) explained that mutants were actually the victims of irrational prejudice by those fortunate enough to be unaffected by the disaster — normal people, or "norms." As a result, all mutants were deprived of citizenship and expelled from Mega-City One, Judge Dredd's city on the east coast of America, and forced to live in the radioactive wasteland outside the city, the inhospitable and lawless Cursed Earth. There they remained for sixty years.
Due to the ban on citizenship, mutants are forced to live in the radioactive wasteland outside the city, the inhospitable and lawless Cursed Earth. Mutants were prohibited from entering the city, and those who attempted to enter by scaling the city walls would be arrested and expelled, or killed resisting arrest. They would usually feature in stories simply as hostile criminals for Dredd to fight, but some stories set in the Cursed Earth would also show them in a more sympathetic light, as victims of unjust oppression by future society (or sometimes more directly as victims of crime). Initially mutants were mainly used in fight sequences in action stories, but as the years went by, and the tone of "Judge Dredd" stories matured to appeal to a wider audience, stories featuring mutants increasingly emphasized the injustice of their plight, and the harsh, uncompromising enforcement of the anti-mutant laws by Judge Dredd and the Mega-City Justice Department (for example "The Gipper's Big Night," (1991)).
The other mega-cities of Earth are assumed to treat mutants in the same way, though they are rarely mentioned. In the first appearance of Texas City, however, the city was shown enacting "mutant clearances," indicating that mutants had been allowed to be citizens until 2102. A Texan judge said the reason for this was simply "Texas City will walk tall again without them uglies!" Unlike Mega-City One, they were specifically sent at gunpoint to "new homelands across Lake Louisiana". However, mutants could have permits to work in legal "danger parks" where they were exploited for the purposes of entertainment.
Judge Dredd himself was prepared to treat mutants decently when he met them in the Cursed Earth, so long as they behaved themselves. However, any who entered his city were automatically criminals, and had to be dealt with accordingly and without compassion. Under Mega-City law, any norm who harboured a mutant was himself guilty of a crime and liable to strict penalties. Since a normal woman could still give birth to a mutant child, the parents of mutated offspring would sometimes go to great lengths to conceal the birth (or, at least, its abnormality) and raise their child in secret. Detection of a mutant foetus in a routine pregnancy scan would result in mandatory abortion; detection of a mutant birth would result in the parents being forced to choose between exile to the Cursed Earth, the "euthanasia" of the child, or the mutant being deported to Cursed Earth farming camps. 
In 2006, early episodes of the story "Origins" (2006–07) introduced Randy Fargo and his family, mutants who are distant cousins of Judge Dredd. Dredd was unaware of their existence until he met them in the Cursed Earth in 2129. After the Fargos helped Dredd in his mission, they parted on amicable terms. However they would soon return to the "Judge Dredd" strip in 2007. "Origins" heralded a turning-point in the treatment of mutants by writer John Wagner, and indeed by the character Dredd as well. Instead of making brief appearances in the strip to emphasize the science-fictional setting, mutants became the focus of a new storyline which explored Dredd's shifting attitude towards the issue of mutant rights, which began in 2007 with "Mutants in Mega-City One."
"Mutants in Mega-City One".
In "Mutants in Mega-City One" (2007), Judge Dredd concludes that the anti-mutant laws are unjust and should be repealed, having given serious thought to the issue for the first time in his life as a result of meeting his mutant relatives. He persuades Chief Judge Hershey to put his motion to a vote before Mega-City One's ruling body, the Council of Five. While the vote is pending, however, Dredd is still obliged to enforce the very laws he seeks to repeal. When a normal couple discover that their newborn baby is a mutant, they abscond rather than face the Mutant Catchers, who will force them into exile in the Cursed Earth desert. They find refuge with other mutants in a safehouse run by sympathisers, where they hope to live in secret. However Dredd is searching for them, as absconding with a mutant child carries a mandatory sentence of three years.
In the course of his investigation, Dredd (and through Dredd, the reader) learns from another citizen about some of the terrible consequences of the city's prejudice against mutants. When the citizen's family was discovered to have been hiding his mutant younger brother for twelve years, the whole family was incarcerated for their crime, while the child was deported from the city to a mutant internment camp in the Cursed Earth. Unable to cope, the child died, and his body was fed to the pigs, mutants not being considered worthy of a decent burial. This is the first mention in "Judge Dredd" of mutant camps for city-born mutants, which would later be stated to be compulsory until the mutant became 16 – after that, they are supposedly free to leave if they choose.
Dredd eventually discovers the safehouse where the couple he seeks is hiding, and arrests everyone present. The normal citizens are imprisoned, and all of the mutants are deported to a mutant camp in the Cursed Earth. Meanwhile the Council of Five unanimously votes against reforming the law. As a result, when Randy Fargo and some of Dredd's other mutant relations arrive at the city gate to visit him, Dredd is compelled to deny them entry to the city, and they are forced to turn back.
"Mutants in Mega-City One" was immediately followed by "The Facility" and "The Secret of Mutant Camp 5," in which Dredd tours Mega-City One's mutant camps in the Cursed Earth, and discovers that standards of care in the camps have sunk to a shockingly low level. His investigations uncover criminal neglect and appalling abuses, including starvation, torture and outright murder. Alarmed by Dredd's discoveries, Chief Judge Hershey becomes slightly more sympathetic to Dredd's new views, and orders an improvement in standards at the camps. Nevertheless, no change of general policy is forthcoming.
The above stories contained obvious references to Guantanamo Bay detention camp and to the Nazi extermination camps. (They were also the first stories after the end of the "America" trilogy to feature Cadet America Beeny.)
In "The Spirit of Christmas," Dredd again confronts the Chief Judge and demands a second vote on repealing the mutant laws, threatening to resign if she does not support him. As Dredd is the city's most famous and feared judge, Hershey bows to this threat and agrees to schedule another vote, hoping that enough senior judges can be persuaded to change their minds.
Although "Emphatically Evil" (2008) was primarily a story about serial killer PJ Maybe (and Beeny's first case following her promotion to full judge), the mutants story continued as a subplot. Public opinion is radically against Dredd's proposed reforms, with polls showing that 96 percent of the city opposes relaxing strict controls on mutants. While anti-reform protests erupt into riots on the streets, the Council convenes to debate Dredd's motion. Although Dredd is absent from the meeting, not being a member of the Council, he has earlier met with the members to try to change their minds, saying "I believe in justice, and an injustice has to be righted, no matter how inconvenient." However it is not Dredd's logic but his threat to resign which ultimately carries the vote in his favour.
Following the vote, the story "...Regrets" depicts Randy Fargo's return to Mega-City One with his family, this time invited by the Judges as guests of honour. As relatives of Chief Judge Fargo (the founder of the Judge System and Dredd's clone father), their tour of the city attracts much media attention, and controversy. Although the Mayor of Mega-City One gives them all honorary citizenship, feelings are still running high amongst the population, and talk shows are full of heated debate about the merits of Dredd's law. Public opinion becomes slightly more favourable after Jubal Fargo gives his life to rescue a four-year-old child from kidnappers, and the Fargos return to their home in the Cursed Earth. However mutants' rights still continue to arouse strong passions.
"Mutie Block" reveals that mutants are being admitted to the city following strict selection processes, and being given segregated accommodation in Norma Jean Baker Block. Anti-mutant protests are still continuing, and mutants are targeted for violent hate crimes, the murder rate for mutants being 3,600 percent above average. Official government policy is to actively discourage mutants from entering the city by giving them demotivational speeches on their arrival and offering cash bribes in exchange for relinquishing their claims to citizenship.
In "Backlash" (2009) senior, hardline judges begin a campaign to elect a new chief judge who will repeal the new pro-mutant laws. Their chosen candidate, Judge Dan Francisco, survives an assassination attempt by mutants. In spite of Dredd's discovery that the assassination was secretly orchestrated by "anti"-mutant activists in order to increase support for their cause, Francisco still defeats Hershey by a landslide.
"Under New Management" shows Francisco's first day in office as the new chief judge. He replaces the entire Council of Five, prohibits mutant immigration, and institutes a policy of exiling the mutants already in the city to new townships in the Cursed Earth, unless they agree to compulsory sterilisation. The new deputy chief judge, Judge Sinfield, assigns Dredd to oversee the operation, with Beeny as his assistant. This story acts as a prologue to "Tour of Duty," which started in the next issue.
"Tour of Duty".
"Tour of Duty" (2009–10) was the longest "Judge Dredd" story ever published up to that point, running for 46 episodes and 285 pages. It tells of Dredd and Beeny's mission in the Cursed Earth, overseeing the resettlement of mutants exiled from the city.
Dredd's assignment effectively amounts to exile from the city, to keep him out of the way while Francisco and Sinfield implement their policy of mutant segregation. Similarly, Hershey has been posted to a position on another planet.
Although Chief Judge Francisco favours exiling the mutants to the Cursed Earth, he nevertheless insists on doing so with some concern for their welfare, authorising increased expenditure on building the Cursed Earth townships, which initially were expected to be cheap shanty-towns. In this respect he is opposed by his Council, who are dismayed at what they see as his wasteful spending of the city's limited budget. Eventually, Deputy Chief Judge Sinfield resorts to illegally drugging Francisco with a mind control drug and persuading him to resign, thereby becoming acting chief judge. Sinfield immediately begins a crackdown on mutants, introducing automatic loss of citizenship and exile from the city for all mutants convicted of any crime, however trivial. The mutant population diminishes from two million to 170,000.
Under Sinfield's rule, criminal organisations exploit the newly vulnerable mutants: they are used for slave labour in exchange for having faked citizenship papers, but whenever they work their debts off, the judges are tipped off about them. A new line in "vi-zines" (magazines featuring real torture) is created for mutants, helped by Justice Department being uninterested in crimes against mutants. Back in the Cursed Earth, suicide rates go up among the mutants who had to return home. However, for a brief time it is legal for mutants to work in pornography – helped by a mutant performer winning Mega-City One the gold medal at the World Sex Championships. Sinfield bans mutant pornography when he became acting chief judge, solely due to his own distaste for it.
Exasperated with Sinfield, Dredd eventually decides to run against him in another election. However in order to attract enough support to mount a serious challenge, Dredd is forced to compromise his mutant rights stance. Instead of promising a return to Chief Judge Hershey's policies, Dredd has to settle for returning to Francisco's. However before the election can take place, Sinfield's crime is uncovered and he is arrested. Francisco returns to office and appoints Dredd to the Council of Five.
Mutant townships.
Due to the events in "Tour of Duty", many mutants now live in one of four townships in the Cursed Earth. These are policed by only a few judges: the bulk of policing is done by mutant deputies, who have limited police powers. 
Thanks to Francisco's actions, the townships ended up being better places to live in than Mega-City One was: less crowded, less crime-ridden, and having a few more civil rights, such as jury trials unless a judge passes an instant sentence. (Initially, the juries were meant as a short-term measure to reduce pressure on the scant judge numbers.) This has caused anger in some parts of the city, disgruntled that the mutants are getting a better life than 'normal' people; some elements in Justice Department also feel that the townships are allowed to be too liberal.
After the near-destruction of the city in "Day of Chaos", the townships voted to send aid: forty thousand mutant volunteers, commanded by Judge Rico.

Mutants in related series.
Mutants, and their persecution by normal humans, also feature prominently in the series "Strontium Dog", a series which also appears in "2000 AD" and is written by John Wagner. There are two crossover stories which link these two series together in the same world (though this link is ignored outside of crossover stories). In "Top Dog", the first crossover, Dredd discovers Alpha is a mutant and remarks he's just "adding to your crimes". 
"Durham Red" is a spin-off from "Strontium Dog", which portrays interplanetary war between mutants and "norms" in the distant future.

14 Going on 30

14 Going on 30 is a 1988 made-for-TV movie broadcast by American Broadcasting Company and Buena Vista Television, and later distributed by Walt Disney Home Video. It stars Steven Eckholdt as Danny, a fourteen-year-old boy who is infatuated with his teacher Peggy Noble (Daphne Ashbrook). Danny uses a "growth accelerator" to make himself appear older than his actual age in an attempt to seduce her. A similar age swap and nearly identical title appears in the 2004 film "13 Going on 30", and the earlier film may have influenced the latter.
Plot.
14-year-old Danny O'Neil (Gabey Olds) is madly in love with his teacher, Miss Peggy Noble (Daphne Ashbrook). Given the fact that she is engaged to the cold-tempered and vicious gym teacher, Roy Kilton (Rick Rossovich), who is nicknamed Jackjaw for his constant threat of breaking his pupils' jaws, Danny goes through his school days somewhat uninspired and suffers in silence.
One day, he oversees his geeky friend Lloyd Duffy (Adam Carl), who happens to live next door with his uncle Herb (Harry Morgan) and aunt May (Irene Tedrow), growing fruits with an experimental growth accelerator. Danny becomes enthusiastic of turning himself into a grown man with the same machine, in order to break up Miss Noble's engagement, as well as convincing her to give him a chance. Lloyd is reluctant to help him out, aware of everything that could go wrong, so Danny secretly uses the machine at night. He saw that the timing was perfect, considering that his parents will leave the house for a week. Unaware of the consequences, he turns into a 30-year-old man (Steve Eckholdt).
The next day, Lloyd immediately starts working on a machine with the opposite effect so Danny will be able to return to his 14-year-old body soon. During this process, Danny visits the high school to pursue Miss Noble. When he arrives, he is mistaken as the school newest principal, Harold Forndexter. He not only impresses his assistant Louisa Horton (Loretta Swit) with the introduction of his new rules - which include having as much fun as possible - but also Peggy, who admires his youthful approach of life.
Much to the dismay of Kilton, she agrees to go on a date with 'Harold'. Even though Kilton follows their every step, Peggy has a splendid evening with the new principal, and they almost kiss at the end of the night. During a school dance, 'Harold' convinces Peggy that Kilton is not right for her, and she breaks off the engagement. Immediately after, 'Harold' and Peggy become a couple. Kilton, refusing to accept this, tries to find out more on Forndexter, and finds out that 'Harold' is an impostor, as the real Forndexter (Alan Thicke) looks quite differently. He immediately warns the police, who arrive quickly to arrest him.
While 'Harold' tries to escape, Lloyd informs him that his machine is complete. After getting rid of the cops, 'Harold' tells Peggy that he has to leave town for good and then becomes 14 again. Peggy witnesses this transformation, and realizes that 'Harold' was actually Danny, one of her favorite students. Because she has fallen in love with him, she uses the same machine to turn herself into a 14-year-old (Amy Hathaway), which enables her to be with Danny. Meanwhile, Lloyd turns himself into an old professor, Mr. Lloyd (Sal Viscuso), and starts working at the same high school as a teacher.
Cast.
Trivia.
The ending to this movie in which Peggy turns herself young to be with Danny has often been mistaken for a lost alternate ending to Big, which was released the same year.

Magallanes Basin

The Magallanes Basin is a major geological basin reaching as far north as upper Patagonia in Chile. Rocks within it derive from the Jurassic period and includes the Cerro Toro formation. This basin offers opportunities to study numerous ancient fossil lifeforms and other prehistorical natural features due to the deep sedimentary layering.
Prehistoric man.
Certain geologic formations within the Magallanes Basin offered early humans rock shelters and caves; one of the most notable of such locations is the Cueva del Milodon, a site where ancient man was known to live, based upon the archaeological recovery from this series of caves.

Academic dress of the University of Edinburgh

The University of Edinburgh was founded in 1582.
Use of academic dress.
Academic dress is compulsory at official ceremonial occasions, such as graduation and the installations of Rector and Chancellor. As with the other 'ancient universities' in Scotland, undergraduates at Edinburgh are entitled to wear an undergraduate gown, made of scarlet Russell cord and cut in the London undergraduate shape. In recent times the undergraduate gown has been worn most commonly by members of the University choir and by students taking part in the traditional festivities surrounding the installation of the Rector.
University officials.
Chancellor: Robe of black brocaded satin, trimmed with gold lace and with gold frogs down the fronts and on the sleeves. Black silk velvet trencher, with gold button and tassel.
Vice-Chancellor: Robe and trencher the same as the Chancellor’s, but trimmed with silver in place of gold. 
Rector: Black silk gown, with crimson silk velvet sleeves; the gown is trimmed round the collar and down the front edges with broad gold lace, and the sleeves round the bottom with narrower gold lace. Black silk velvet trencher, with gold button and tassel. 
Principal: Mauve corded silk robe trimmed with velvet to match. Black silk velvet trencher, with gold button and tassel. 
Vice-Principal: Maroon silk, facings and yoke of cherry red velvet. 
Members of the University Court: Black silk robe, open sleeves, with gold frog on each sleeve.
Graduate dress.
Graduates wear the gown of the highest degree conferred upon them with or without the appropriate hood, depending upon the occasion.
Graduation.
Male graduands are required to appear in black or dark coloured clothes, white collars, and white bow ties. Alternatively, either normal or full day Highland Dress may be worn with the appropriate hose. Female graduands are required to wear sleeved black or white dresses, or white blouses and dark skirts or trousers. Colours, apart from the hood, should not be worn. 
Graduands for the degree of Doctor of Divinity, Doctor of Laws, Doctor of Medicine, Doctor of Dental Surgery, Doctor of Letters, Doctor of Science, Doctor of Music and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery must appear for graduation in a gown of superfine scarlet cloth with loose sleeves. 
Graduands for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy appear in a gown of black silk or stuff with long sleeves with three inch red facings down the front. All other graduands must wear a gown of black silk or stuff, with long sleeves, in the Cambridge M.A. shape but with an inverted-T armhole. All graduands must wear the hood appropriate to the degree which they are about to receive. Although academical caps do form part of the dress of the university, they are not worn or carried by graduands at the graduation ceremony; in full dress, Edinburgh doctors wear a black silk velvet 'John Knox' cap.

Reuben Wells Leonard

Lieutenant-Colonel Reuben Wells Leonard was a soldier, civil engineer, railroad and mining executive, and philanthropist.
Education.
Following a short stint as a teacher in Brant County, he studied civil engineering at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, student # 87. He graduated from RMC as the silver medallist in a class of 23 cadets.
Career.
He worked as an engineer for the Canadian Pacific Railway. He left temporarily to serve as a transport officer in the Northwest Rebellion of 1885. In the period from 1886 to early 1906, he was involved mainly in railway and hydroelectric projects in central and eastern Canada. Among these, he worked on the construction of the first Niagara Falls power station, in 1892–93. A grubstaking venture in northern Ontario in 1905 led to the acquisition of a mineral-rich claim in the centre of Cobalt, Ontario. These mines, which contained cobalt, nickel), silver, and arsenic, made him wealthy.
Railway.
In 1911, Robert Borden made him chairman of the National Transcontinental Railway Concern, the forerunner of the Canadian National Railways. He oversaw the construction of the line from Moncton, New Brunswick, to Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Military service.
He joined the Corps of Guides in 1904. During World War I, he served in Europe with the Corps of Guides. He was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel in September 1915.
Philanthropy.
In 1916, he established a philanthropic foundation and gave extensively to educational institutions, churches (low-church Anglican), hospitals, and other causes.
Reuben Leonard was a philanthropist, and made monetary donations not only to Queen's but also to the Girl Guides of Canada, Scouts Canada, the University of Toronto, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and many other organisations. He also established the Leonard Foundation in 1916, educational trust to provide financial assistance for children of ministers, soldiers, teachers and engineers. He gave generously to support the war effort.
Governance.
Following the armistice, he served a year as president of the Engineering Institute of Canada in 1919-20. In 1920, he was to the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission. He was appointed to boards of governance at the University of Toronto, Wycliffe College in Toronto, Ridley College in St Catharines, Ontario the School of Mining and Agriculture and Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario and the Khaki University of Canada.
Family.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reuben Wells Leonard and his wife Kate built a stately home, Springbank, which overlooked the old Welland Canal in St Catharines. They did not have any children.
Honours.
Queen’s University, conferred an honorary doctorate in October 1930.
Leonard Reef, St. Joseph Channel, Algoma, Ontario was named in honour of 87 Lieutenant Colonel Reuben Wells Leonard (RMC 1883), Chairman, National Transcontinental Railway. Leonard Reef, St. Joseph Channel, Algoma District, Ontario was named in his honour. 46°18′19″ North 84°4′10″ West There is also a Leonard Township in the Timiskaming District, Ontario.
Legacy.
In 1923, he donated land to Queen’s University, on which Leonard Hall, and Leonard Field were named in his honour.
Controversy.
Under the Leonard Foundation terms, boursaries were made available to students who were white, British subjects, and Protestant and no more than one-quarter of the moneys could be awarded to females. The goal was to provide financial assistance to needy students who showed the promise of becoming leading citizens of the British Empire. A complaint filed against the Leonard Foundation under the Ontario Human Rights Code in 1986 prompted litigation. The Ontario Court of Appeal held in 1990, that the trust’s exclusionary terms relating to race, religion, nationality, and gender were contrary to law.

Feng Tianwei

Feng Tianwei (, ; born 31 August 1986) is a Singaporean table tennis player, ranked 4th in the world as a singles player as of September 2013. Born in China, she moved to Singapore under the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme in March 2007 and commenced her international career in competitive table tennis the following month. She received Singapore citizenship in January 2008.
Feng represented Singapore for the first time in the Olympic Games at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. On 15 August, the Singapore team composed of Feng and her teammates Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu defeated South Korea 3–2 in the semifinals. The team lost to China in the final, but obtained the silver medal. This was Singapore's first Olympic medal in 48 years and its first as an independent nation. Feng won her first professional singles title at the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) Pro Tour Polish Open in Warsaw on 30 November 2008, in an all-Singapore final against Wang. In May 2010 the trio of Feng, Wang and Sun Beibei stunned the reigning champions China 3–1 in the Liebherr World Team Table Tennis Championships in Moscow, making Singapore world champions for the first time.
On 1 August 2012, Feng beat Kasumi Ishikawa of Japan 4–0 to win the women's singles bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Singapore's first Olympic singles medal since the 1960 Summer Olympics. On 7 August, she was part of the women's team with Li and Wang that achieved the bronze against South Korea. This was the first time Singapore had won two medals at an Olympic Games.
Early years.
Feng Tianwei was born on 31 August 1986 in Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China. She is the only daughter of Feng Qingzhi, a granary worker, and his wife Li Chunping, an employee of a department store. Feng's parents, who were poor, lived frugally for years to pay for her table tennis training. Her father suffered from multiple sclerosis, but she was not told how severe his illness was. He died in 2002, weeks before Feng tried out for China's national B squad. Although Feng topped the qualifying matches a month later and was called up for the national team in 2003, she suffered from a long illness; a source close to her said it was "because she missed her father too much". Feng left China in 2005 to play in the Japanese professional league. While there she was spotted by Liu Guodong, then a coach with the Singapore Table Tennis Association, in 2006. In March 2007 she was invited to train in Singapore under the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. She became a Singapore citizen in January 2008.
Career as national player.
Feng made her international "début" for Singapore in June 2007 as an under-21 player at the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) Pro Tour Volkswagen Korean Open. As a singles player, Feng was ranked 73rd in the world in August 2007. Nonetheless, that month she achieved a silver medal in the singles at the ITTF Pro Tour Chinese Taipei Open, her compatriot Li Jiawei beating her to take the gold.
Feng was a member of the silver medal-winning Singapore women's team at the World Team Championships in Guangzhou in 2008, and also defeated the top seed Zhang Yining from China in the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup held in Sapporo between 29 and 30 March 2008, eventually achieving second place behind China's Guo Yue. She obtained singles bronze medals at the ITTF Pro Tour Chile Open in April and the Singapore Open in June 2008, and helped the women's team to a second place at the Volkswagen Japan Open in Yokohama on 24 May 2008.
2008 Summer Olympics.
Feng represented Singapore for the first time at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the women's table tennis team tournament. The youngest member of the team which included Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu, she contributed significantly to Singapore's 3–2 win against South Korea in the semifinals on 15 August by defeating Dang Ye-Seo and Park Mi-Young in two singles matches. Feng's match against Park was closely fought, with Feng eventually overcoming Park 3–1. Singapore was assisted by the implementation of the expedite system when the game failed to be completed in ten minutes. Under the system, players serve on alternative points rather than on every two points. A receiving player scores a point if she manages 13 returns, which disadvantages defensive play by the server. The system unsettled Park, and Feng won two minutes after its introduction in the match when Park committed a service fault. Interviewed afterwards, Feng said: "I definitely did not expect that error. It was a surprise and the best birthday present I've ever gotten."
On 17 August, Feng and her teammates gained Singapore a silver medal in women's table tennis after losing to China in three matches. Feng played the starting singles match, winning the first game but eventually losing to China's Wang Nan 3–1. This was the first time Singapore had won an Olympic medal since its independence in 1965. The medal came 48 years after Tan Howe Liang won the country's first medal, a silver in weightlifting in the lightweight category at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.
Feng and her teammates received byes into the third round of the women's singles tournament. Feng defeated South Korea's Dang 4–0 in the third round and the Netherlands' Li Jie 1–4 in the fourth round, but fell 4–1 to China's Zhang Yining in the quarter-finals. Feng made the world number one work for her win, with the final scores being 11–13, 14–12, 12–14, 10–12, 11–13. According to the "Straits Times", Zhang leveraged on her experience by stalling for time at crucial stages of the game, which broke Feng's rhythm. Interviewed after the match, Feng said: "I'm sure I'll win a medal at the next Olympics."
At a victory celebration in Singapore on 25 August, Vivian Balakrishnan, the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, announced that Feng, Li and Wang would be presented with the "Pingat Jasa Gemilang" (Meritorious Service Medal). This is only the third time the medal will be awarded to athletes, the two previous recipients being weightlifter Tan Howe Liang (1962) and swimmer Joscelin Yeo (2006).
In May 2009, the national table tennis women's team, composed of Feng and her teammates Li, Wang and Sun Beibei, were awarded the Team of the Year (Event) prize at the Singapore Sports Awards.
Competitions between 2008 and 2012.
On 9 September 2008, Feng beat her compatriot Wang to clinch the bronze medal at the ITTF Women's World Cup in Kuala Lumpur. Despite crashing out of the singles event earlier, Feng and her teammates Li and Wang won the top title and US$8,000 at the ITTF Pro Tour ERKE German Open in Berlin on 22 November 2008. Feng won her first professional singles title at the Polish Open in Warsaw on 30 November, in an all-Singapore final against Wang. Feng and Yu Mengyu also took silver in the doubles championship. On 2 December 2008, the ITTF announced that Feng was ranked sixth in the world. This made her the top Singapore female table tennis player and the highest-placed player in the world not representing China. She was third in "Today" newspaper's list of athletes of the year for 2008.
On 23 August 2009, Feng achieved her second Pro Tour singles title at the KAL Cup Korean Open in Seoul.
Feng took part in the 25th Southeast Asian Games in Vientiane, Laos. She was a member of the Singapore women's team with Sun Beibei and Wang Yuegu that beat Thailand 3–0 on 10 December 2009. On 14 December 2009, she and her partner Wang Yuegu were defeated by compatriots Sun Beibei and Yu Mengyu in an all-Singapore final in the women's doubles. The following day, in her maiden appearance at the Games, she achieved gold in the singles competition after trouncing Wang 4–1.
Together with Sun and Wang, Feng was a member of the team at the Liebherr World Team Table Tennis Championships in Moscow that defeated China, 17-time winner and the reigning world champion, with a score of 3–1 on 30 May 2010. This was the first time that Singapore had won the event. In the two games she played, Feng beat Liu Shiwen and Ding Ning, respectively ranked number one and four in the world. The "Southern Daily" published in Guangdong criticized Chinese sports authorities for permitting China-born players like Feng, Li and Wang to leave and play for other countries: "For the sake of developing the sport, China has been talking about 'breeding wolves'. Well, now the wolf has grown up and it has returned home to bite."
The Singapore Table Tennis Association made Feng the inaugural winner of its Best Player of the Year award on 12 February 2010. As of 8 April 2010, she had worked her way up to a second-place ranking in the world. On 3 May 2010, the Singapore National Olympic Council named her Sportswoman of the Year for 2009, and the national women's table tennis team of which she is a member was Team of the Year (Team Event).
2012 Summer Olympics.
Feng represented Singapore at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and was the nation's flagbearer at the Parade of Nations segment of the opening ceremony. She entered the women's singles competition seeded sixth, and progressed until she was defeated 4–2 by China's Ding Ning in the semi-finals. On 1 August 2012, she overcame Kasumi Ishikawa of Japan 4–0 (11–9, 11–6, 11–6, 11–5) to take the bronze medal, becoming the second Singaporean to win an individual Olympic medal. (The first was Tan Howe Liang who won a silver for weightlifting in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.) Interviewed after her win, Feng said: "I'm really happy, although I feel it's come a little too suddenly. My form wasn't very good lately, so I didn't dare to carry too much expectations coming into the London Olympics. It was just a relief to win."
Feng also participated in the women's team competition with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal on 7 August 2012 by edging South Korea out 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11; and Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This marked the first time Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, I told myself that I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win."

USNS Haiti Victory (T-AK-238)

USNS "Haiti Victory" (T-AGM-238) was originally a "Greenville" "Victory" cargo ship which operated for the U.S. Navy as a cargo carrier in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. 
In 1960 she was renamed USNS "Longview" (T-AGM-3) "Longview"-class missile range instrumentation ship and converted to use as a missile tracking ship which operated in the Pacific Ocean Western Test Range until she was placed out of service and eventually disposed of.
Constructed in California.
"Haiti Victory" (T-AK 238) was laid down under U.S. Maritime Commission contract by Permanente Metals Corporation, Richmond, California, 24 April 1944; launched 20 July: sponsored by Mrs. Lucius Booner; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) 18 September.
World War II commercial operation.
During World War II she operated as a merchantman and was chartered to Waterman Steamship Company.
Acquired by the Navy as a cargo carrier.
Acquired by the Navy 1 March 1950, "Haiti Victory" was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), for cargo operations in the Atlantic Ocean. From 1950 to 1957, sailing from New York City, she made cargo runs to Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean. On 6 May 1953, she collided with the British ferry Duke of York which resulted in the Duke of York having its bow section sheered off.
On 15 June 1957, "Haiti Victory" sailed on her first MSTS cruise to the Pacific Ocean. Steaming via the U.S. West Coast, the veteran cargo ship arrived Pusan, Korea, 1 August. Following several Far East cruises, she resumed operations in the Atlantic in July 1958. Departing New York 11 July she steamed for the Eastern Mediterranean to support United States peacekeeping efforts in Lebanon. Units of the U.S. 6th Fleet had landed U.S. Marines at request of Lebanese President Chamoun who wished to prevent a coup against his regime by communist oriented insurgents.
While operating in the Mideast, she twice steamed through the Suez Canal, for cargo runs to Karachi, Pakistan. Returning to New York 3 January 1959, "Haiti Victory" made another Mediterranean cruise prior to assignment in the Pacific. Arriving San Francisco, California, 4 April she operated off the West Coast until sailing for Hawaii 3 months later.
Conversion to missile support.
Arriving Pearl Harbor 3 July, she underwent conversion and training for a role in America's young space program.
"Haiti Victory" found a place in history, when she became the first ship to recover a space vehicle from orbit. On 11 August 1960, her helicopter retrieved a 300-pound capsule that was launched into orbit the previous day by a Thor-Agena rocket as part of the Central Intelligence Agency's Corona spy satellite project.
"Haiti Victory" was renamed "Longview" and re-classified "T-AGM-3" on 27 November 1960. She continued operations in the Pacific Missile Range supporting the United States space program, performing a variety of scientific duties for the U.S. Air Force Western Test Range.
Final disposition.
"Longview" was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, and was disposed of by MARAD at an unknown date.

Scott Medal

The Walter Scott Medal for Valor is a medal awarded annually for bravery to Garda Síochána police officers. It is not a state award, being in the gift of the commissioner, but the medals are awarded by the Minister for Justice. 
It is also the name of a New York City Fire Department medal, endowed by the same Walter Scott in 1920. Recipients of this medal are also awarded $500, donated by the Fire Foundation of New York, an organization established in 1968 by a group of prominent New York City businessmen, friends of the FDNY, in the interest of rewarding Fire Department members who perform acts above and beyond the call of duty.
History.
The Garda medal was instituted at the behest of Colonel Walter Scott, a New York philanthropist who took an interest in policing. In 1923 he gave a one thousand dollar gold Bond which would pay for in perpetuity a gold medal.
The award was to be presented for under the following condition:
"No action, however heroic, will merit the award of the Scott medal unless it takes the shape of an act of personal bravery, performed intelligently in the execution of duty at imminent risk to the life of the doer, and armed with full previous knowledge of the risk involved".
In 1925, Scott presented a further $500 bond to present silver and bronze medals. These medals were for officers who performed similar acts in the execution of duty but with less risk to their lives and who are next in order of merit.
In 1942, the award condition was amended to "most exceptional bravery and heroism involving the risk of life in the execution of duty".
Design.
The medal was designed by John F. Maxwell, a Dublin-based teacher who also designed the Garda Síochána crest.
The medal is a Celtic cross which is 44mm in diameter with five panels on the face. The inscription on the top panel is "The Scott Medal" and on the lower panel "For Valor". On the right and left are the eagle and shield of the United States. and the harp and sunburst of Ireland, respectively. The centerpiece is the Garda Crest with the intertwined letters G.S. for Garda Síochána..
The reverse is inscribed "Gharda Síochána na h-Éireann". The four outside panels are the arms of the four provinces of Ireland, Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connaught.

<doc id="18903091" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18903091" title="Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem">
Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem

The Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem is a mathematical characterization of cellular automata in terms of their symbolic dynamics. It is named after Morton L. Curtis, Gustav A. Hedlund, and Roger Lyndon; in his 1969 paper stating the theorem, Hedlund credited Curtis and Lyndon as co-discoverers.
The theorem states that a function from a shift space to itself represents the transition function of a one-dimensional cellular automaton if and only if it is continuous (with respect to the Cantor topology) and equivariant (with respect to the shift map). More generally, it asserts that the morphisms between any two shift spaces (i.e., continuous mappings that commute with the shift) are exactly those mappings which can be defined uniformly by a local rule.
The version of the theorem in Hedlund's paper applied only to one-dimensional finite automata, but a generalization to higher dimensional integer lattices was soon afterwards published by , and it can be even further generalized from lattices to discrete groups. One important consequence of the theorem is that, for reversible cellular automata, the reverse dynamics of the automaton can also be described by a cellular automaton.
Definitions.
An alphabet is any finite set of symbols, which may be thought of as the states of the cells in a cellular automaton. A "configuration" is a bi-infinite sequence of symbols from the alphabet:
A "position" in a configuration is an integer, the index of one of the symbols in the sequence; the positions may be thought of as the cells of a cellular automaton. A "pattern" is a finite set of positions and an assignment of symbols to each of these positions.
The shift space is the set of all possible configurations over a given alphabet. It may be given the structure of a topological space according to the Cantor topology, in which the fundamental open sets are the sets of configurations that match any single pattern and the open sets are arbitrary unions of fundamental open sets. In this topology, a function from configurations to configurations is continuous if, for any fixed pattern defining a fundamental open set , the set of configurations mapped by into can itself be described by a (possibly infinite) set of patterns, with the property that a configuration belongs to if and only if it matches a pattern in .
The shift map is a particular continuous function on the shift space that transforms a configuration into a new configuration in which each symbol is shifted one position over from its previous position: that is, for every integer , . A function is equivariant under the shift map if the transformation on configurations described by commutes with the shift map; that is, for every configuration , it must be the case that . Intuitively, this means that every position of the configuration is updated by using the same rule as every other position.
A cellular automaton is defined by a rule for computing the new value of each position in a configuration based only on the values of cells in a finite neighborhood surrounding the position, with all positions of the configuration being updated simultaneously based on the same update rule. That is, the new value of a position is a function only of the values of the cells in its neighborhood rather than depending more generally on an unbounded number of cells of the previous configuration. The function that uses this rule to map a configuration of the cellular automaton into its successor configuration is necessarily equivariant with respect to the shift map, by the assumption that all positions use the same update rule. It is also necessarily continuous in the Cantor topology: if is a fixed pattern, defining a fundamental open set , then is defined by a finite set of patterns, the assignments to cells in the neighborhood of that cause to produce . The Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem states that these two properties are sufficient to define cellular automata: every continuous equivariant function is the update rule of a cellular automaton.
Proof.
Ceccherini-Silberstein and Coornaert provide the following proof of the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem.
Suppose is a continuous shift-equivariant function on the shift space. For each configuration , let be the pattern consisting of the single symbol that appears at position zero of .
By continuity of , there must exist a finite pattern in such that, if the positions outside are changed arbitrarily but the positions within are fixed to their values in , then the result of applying remains the same at position zero. Equivalently, there must exist a fundamental open set such that belongs to and such that for every configuration in , and have the same value at position zero. These fundamental open sets (for all possible configurations ) form an open cover of the shift space. However, the shift space is a compact space: it is a product of finite topological spaces with the alphabet as their points, so compactness follows from Tychonoff's theorem. By compactness, every open cover has a finite subcover. The finite set of positions appearing in this finite subcover may be used as the neighborhood of position zero in a description of as a cellular automaton rule.
The same proof applies more generally when the set of integer positions is replaced by any discrete group , the space of configurations is replaced by the set of functions from to a finite alphabet, and shift-equivariance is replaced by equivariance under the action of on itself. In particular, it applies to cellular automata defined on an integer grid of any dimension.
Counterexample for infinite alphabets.
It is not possible to generalize the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem to infinite alphabets. For example, consider the space of bi-infinite sequences of integers, and define a function from this space to itself
according to the rule that, if , then for every position , . This rule is the same for each position, so it is shift-equivariant. And it can be shown to be continuous according to the Cantor topology: for each finite pattern in , there is a pattern in with at most twice as many positions that forces to generate , consisting of the cells in together with the cells whose values are copied into . However, despite being continuous and equivariant, is not a cellular automaton rule, because the value of any cell can potentially depend on the value of any other cell rather than only depending on the cells in a finite neighborhood.
Application to reversible cellular automata.
A cellular automaton is said to be reversible when every configuration of the automaton has exactly one predecessor. It follows by a compactness argument that the function mapping each configuration to its predecessor is itself continuous in the shift space, and it is clearly also shift-invariant. Therefore, by the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, the time-reversed dynamics of the cellular automaton may itself be generated using a different cellular automaton rule. However, the neighborhood of a cell in the reverse automaton may be significantly larger than the neighborhood of the same cell in the forward automaton.

Reg Barton (born 4 March 1942, Chester) is a former English professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He made 14 Football League appearances for his hometown club, Chester.
Playing career.
A lifelong Chester fan, Barton signed for the club in 1957 and progressed through the ranks to turn professional four years later. He made his first team debut in a 3–2 home defeat to Doncaster Rovers on 27 September 1961 in place of regular goalkeeper John Hardie. Over the following years his league opportunities were limited as he faced competition from Hardie, Frank Adams, Arthur Johnson and Dennis Reeves.
Barton enjoyed a rare run in goal for Chester late in the 1964–65 season, which included a 6–1 win over arch rivals Wrexham. But Barton later conceded five goals in successive league losses to Darlington and Crewe Alexandra and was released at the end of the season.
After leaving Chester, Barton played for Nantlle Vale, Holyhead, Penmaenmawr and Connah's Quay Nomads. Away from football he worked for companies including British Aerospace while living in Buckley and continued to watch Chester regularly.

Gulshan-e-Maymar

Gulshan-e-Maymar () is one of the neighbourhoods of Gadap Town in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.
Gulshan-e-Maymar is a landmark project from Maymar. The concept of Gulshan-e-Maymar originated in the late 1970s – the venture was formally launched in 1980. The core philosophy driving the establishment of this township was to provide a model, master-planned community for Karachi’s populace in a suburban setting. The township was planned from scratch, with a focus on building into the master plan amenities and services that were not available elsewhere in the city. Generous allocation were made for parks, mosques, clubs, health and education facilities, etc. to allow residents to feel self-contained within the bounds of the township. In essence, Gulshan-e-Maymar represented a microcosm of Maymar’s management’s utopian world.
Having gone through 13 phases of extensions and development, Gulshan-e-Maymar currently stands at 1023 acres. Its population today is at 30% of its optimal capacity of 100,000, which is the number around which all the amenities and services have been planned. The township has witnessed significant growth in recent years due to its quaint setting, plethora of amenities, relatively low air and noise pollution, and access to one of the major freeways of the country. At its current growth rate, the township will get close to its capacity figure by 2012. The significant growth of this township has resulted in exponential appreciation of real estate prices within it – this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future as evidenced by the growth projections and the lack of alternative townships with similar facilities and amenities.
Gulshan-e-Maymar township is situated just off the Super Highway (main highway between Karachi and Hyderabad) in KDA Scheme 45 (and partly in KDA scheme 33) in Karachi. It is about ten kilometers north-east of Sohrab Goth / F.B. Area and approximately 15 kilometers from the Expo Center. Its postal code is 75340.

General Archive of the Nation (Argentina)

The General Archive of the Nation (in Spanish: "Archivo General de la Nación") are the national archives of Argentina. 
Overview.
The archives were established on August 28, 1821, by Governor Martín Rodríguez as the Buenos Aires Province Archive. The institution (AGN) absorbed numerous historical archives, libraries, and other collections over the subsequent decades, and in 1957 acquired the National Print Archive, a bureau established in 1939. Its collections occupy around 14 km (9 mi) of shelf stacks, and the AGN is a member of the Memory of the World Programme, a UNESCO initiative.
Operated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the AGN is organized into five departments:
Headquarters.
Housed within the former Congress building in 1906, the AGN was relocated to its present address at 246 Leandro Alem Avenue (a former National Mortgage Bank office designed by Arturo Prins, and completed in 1920), upon the inaugural of the new Mortgage Bank building in 1950. 
The headquarters cannot house the entirety of its vast collections, which include over of shelves of documentation; the Intermediate Archive, for instance, was opened in another, nearby building. Plans were announced for the archives' transfer to the former ALEA Building, a Rationalist structure located behind the Alas Building that was ultimately sold to developer IRSA in 1998. Construction was approved in 2012 for a new main building for the AGN, designed by Fabio Estremera, Luciana Deschamps and Javier Gavernet, and to be located on the site of the former Caseros Prison in the Parque Patricios district.

History.
The school originally operated from premises in Northampton. In 1946 the Upton Hall estate was sold by the last private owner to a trust with the converted property opening as Upton Hall School. The establishment was renamed Quinton House School in 1966. Ownership of the school buildings passed to Northampton Borough Council in 1986, with the school remaining as tenant of the buildings. 
The 1990s saw extensive renovations and upgrading of facilities at Quinton House, including a new sports field, pavilion and sixth form centre (including classrooms and common rooms for students).

Elena Leuşteanu

Elena Leuşteanu-Popescu (-Teodorescu), (July 4, 1935 – August 16, 2008) was a female Romanian artistic gymnast who represented Romania at three Olympic games. During her career she won three Olympic bronze medals, one world bronze medal and five continental silver medals. She was the first artistic gymnast of Romania to win an individual Olympic medal (in 1956).
1954 - 1956: World Championships and Olympic Games Debut.
Leuşteanu made her debut at the 1954 World Championships in Rome, Italy, where she placed 4th with her team, 5th in the individual combined standings, and was a vault finalist.
At the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, Leuşteanu led her Romanian team the bronze medal at these games, a first for Romania at any World Championships or Olympics. In the individual combined standings, she tied Olga Tass of Hungary for 4th place, just .100 behind bronze medal position. She qualified for three of the four event finals: vault, where she placed 6th; balance beam, where she placed 6th; and floor exercise, where she became the first Romanian woman to win an individual Olympic gymnastics medal - a bronze.
1957 - 1960: Continued Success.
The first ever European Artistic Gymnastics Championships for women, held in 1957 in Bucharest in her native country of Romania, saw Leuşteanu win the silver in the individual all-around competition behind Soviet Larisa Latynina. In the event finals, she collected two more medals in both the uneven bars and floor exercises.
In Moscow at the 1958 World Championships, competing under her newly acquired married name, 'Elena Teodorescu', she helped her team to the bronze medal and placed 17th in the individual combined exercises and was, again, a vault finalist.
At the second European Artistic Gymnastics Championships for women, held in 1959 in Krakow, Poland, she repeated her 2nd-place all-around finish and qualified to three of the four event finals where she won silver on the uneven bars as she had at the previous European Championships.
At the 1960 Rome Olympics, she buttressed her stronger teammate Sonia Iovan, helping their team to the bronze and she was 11th in the individual combined standings.
Post 1960 and Later Life.
In Leuşteanu's 3rd appearance at the European Championships held in 1961 in Leipzig, East Germany, she placed 6th in the all-around and qualified to two event finals - uneven bars and floor where she placed 4th and 5th, respectively. In 1964 she was a member of the team representing Romania at the Olympic Games. She placed 6th with the team and 20th all around.
In 2006, at a celebration commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation, Leuşteanu was the first gymnast to be mentioned and honoured and clips of her performance on the uneven bars were presented. She took part in the celebration, ascending to the podium along with other notable Romanian gymnasts of the past such as Nadia Comăneci, Daniela Silivaş, and Lavinia Miloșovici.
While her fellow Romanians were at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, successfully defending the legacy of Romanian gymnastics she helped to create, Leuşteanu died in mid August 2008 at the age of 73 after a struggle with pancreatic cancer.

18A

The 18A was an Argentine "cacerolazo" that took place on April 18, 2013. Attended by nearly two million people, it was the largest demonstration against the president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. 
Antecedents.
The 18A (a term that stands for the date "April 18") was initially called by groups in social networks as Facebook. Those groups had organized previous "cacerolazos", the 8N and the 13S, and sought to repeat their success. The Argentine branch of the Anonymous group was among the organizators as well. Opposition parties in Argentina had not been formally involved in the previous demonstrations, which had no political leaning; in this case the organizators asked for political support from them. 
The government proposed a number of bills to amend the judiciary. Three bills were controversial: the first proposes to limit the injunctions against the state, the second to include people selected in national elections at the body that appoints or accuses judges, and the third to create a new court that would limit the number of cases treated by the Supreme Court. The opposition considered that those bills attempt to control the judiciary. As the bills were going to be discussed on April 18, the Radical Civic Union, the Republican Proposal and the internal factions of Peronism that oppose Kirchner formally supported the demonstration. Still, the government announced that they would not decline the bills, even if the demonstration was massive.
The demonstration.
Many groups met at 19:00 at several points of Buenos Aires, marching to the Obelisk and Plaza de Mayo at 20:00. The demonstration included no speeches or orators, and the political parties that joined it did not use political flags or banners. The people marched then to the Argentine National Congress, which was still discussing the bill. A group of people managed to trespass the crowd control barriers and get to the entry of the Congress, by the time the bill was being approved.
The demonstration took place at other cities of Argentina as well. The people in Córdoba filled all the space at the intersection of the avenues Vélez Sarsfield and Hipólito Irigoyen. There were demonstrations at many other cities of the Córdoba Province, such as Villa Carlos Paz, Río Cuarto, Villa María, Villa Dolores and Alta Gracia; governor José Manuel de la Sota gave his support. The demonstration in Rosario met at the National Flag Memorial, which was attended by Miguel del Sel of the PRO party. La Plata, which was highly damaged by the 2013 Argentina floods, had a demonstration at Plaza Moreno, with people opposing the mayor Pablo Bruera and the perceived corruption in the national government. There were demonstrations at Mar del Plata, Salta, Bariloche, San Juan, Santiago del Estero, Bahía Blanca and Misones, among other cities. There were small protests at the Argentine embassies in 15 foreign cities, such as Sydney, Tokio, Washington, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Milan, Santiago de Chile and Rio de Janeiro. 
President Cristina Kirchner ignored the protest, and wrote several messages in Twitter during it, none of them related to the demonstration. She was not at the country at the moment, as she was visiting Venezuela for the inauguration of president Nicolás Maduro. Still, there was a demonstration outside the Quinta de Olivos, the official presidential residence.

Al-Qadmus

Al-Qadmus (, also spelled al-Qadmous or Kadmus) is a town in northwestern Syria, administratively part of the Tartus Governorate, located northeast of Tartus and 14 kilometers southeast of Baniyas. Nearby localities include Kaff al-Jaa and Masyaf to the east, Wadi al-'Uyun and al-Shaykh Badr to the south, Hammam Wasel, al-Qamsiyah and Maten al-Sahel to the southwest, Taanita to the west, al-Annazeh to the northwest and Deir Mama to the northeast. It is situated just east of the Mediterranean coast and its ruined castle stands on a plateau roughly 850 meters above sea level and just above the town. 
According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, al-Qadmus had a population of 5,551 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the al-Qadmus "nahiyah" ("sub-district") which contained 25 localities with a collective population of 22,370 in 2004. The inhabitants al-Qadmus are predominantly Ismailis and Alawites, with each community constituting about 50% of the population. The villages in the surrounding countryside are mostly inhabited by Alawites. 
Al-Qadmus is home to an important medieval castle that served as the headquarters of the Ismaili community in Syria, known as the Assassins during the Crusader era. Today, the castle is largely in ruins and, along with some scattered Ottoman-era houses throughout the town, serves as a tourist site. Al-Qadmus also contains a large mosque with an octagonal minaret. The town is also a center for tobacco production in Syria.
History.
Medieval period.
The fortress of al-Qadmus was captured by the Crusader king Bohemond I of Antioch in 1129. In 1130-31 it was recaptured by local Muslim forces. The fortress was later sold to the Ismaili (known then as the Assassins) sect in 1132 by the Muslim "emir" of al-Kahf, Sayf al-Mulk ibn Amrun. By 1167 the scholar Benjamin of Tudela wrote that al-Qadmus served as the principal seat of the Assassins. Although details are few, al-Qadmus changed hands between the Assassins and the Crusaders a few more times, before being firmly under the control of the former.
Al-Qadmus was captured and annexed to the Mamluk Sultanate by Baibars in 1273. It was still controlled by the Ismailis, albeit as loyal subjects to the sultanate, during the intermittent reign of Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (1294-1340). When North African scholar Ibn Batuta visited al-Qadmus in 1355, during Mamluk rule, noting that it was part of the "niyabah" ("governorship") of Masyaf, a dependency of Tripoli. Later this governorship was detached from Tripoli and transferred to Damascus province when it was visited by al-Qalqashandi in 1412. Taxes on cotton cloth and silk were abolished in the district of al-Qadmus by various Mamluk sultans in the late 15th century.
Ottoman era.
In 1683, during the Ottoman period, Muslim scholar Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi visited al-Qadmus and noted the "emir" of the fortress belonged to the Tanukhi clan, an Arab tribe that originally settled in the Batanea area of southern Syria during Byzantine rule and migrated northwards.
In the 1830s Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt destroyed the fortress of al-Qadmus during the Khedivate Egyptian invasion of the Levant. Al-Qadmus was the seat of Ismaili power at the time. It was also the center of a district which contained 177 villages. The leading families of the town, and the ones where the "emirs" hailed from, were the Hejawiyah and the Suwaydaniya. In the 1840s the Ismaili chief of al-Qadmus successfully lobbied the Ottoman authorities to allow Ismaili resettlement of the abandoned town of al-Salamiyah, east of Hama. Pressure from the surrounding Alawite heartland caused many to emigrate for al-Salamiyah, although the town maintained its political and economic significance in the region and served a commanding role in the central Coastal Mountain Range, similar to that played by Safita. Al-Qadmus's inhabitants specialized in commerce and artisan crafts. The town was a destination for farmers from al-Annazah, Talin and al-Shaykh Badr and exported the agricultural products of the area to major cities like Hama, Tripoli and Beirut. 
While most of the Ismailis in Syria transferred their allegiance to the Qasim Shahi line of Aga Khan III in 1887, the Ismailis of Qadmus and Masyaf remained affiliated with the Muhammad Shahi line. They are known as the "Ja'afariya" sect and by the 1990s they numbered around 15,000. The quarter in al-Salamiyah where many of al-Qadmus' inhabitants had settled was named "al-Qadamisa," after the town of their origin.
Modern era.
In December 1918, during the Syrian Coastal Revolt led by Saleh al-Ali against the occupying French authorities, French forces stationed at al-Qadmus attempted to launch an attack against al-Ali's stronghold in nearby al-Shaykh Badr. Al-Ali and his forces engaged and defeated the French near the village of Wadi al-Oyun. Because the Ismaili leadership in al-Qadmus had allied themselves with the French, al-Ali assaulted the town soon afterward. French forces came to aid their allies, but were defeated a second time on 21 February 1919. By July 1919 the French and al-Ali concluded a peace agreement, but it was violated by the former when, from their base in al-Qadmus, they burned down the village of Kaff al-Jaz. Subsequently, al-Ali launched a counterattack against al-Qadmus.
Prior to the ascent of the Baathist government in 1963, the built-up areas of al-Qadmus was largely concentrated just south and east of the citadel, where most houses were built closely together. This area contained the old "souk" ("market") and the Ismaili mosque. In the 1970s and 1980s, during the presidency of Hafez al-Assad, the town expanded northward towards the east-west road connecting Masyaf and Baniyas. The intersection of this highway has become the commercial center of the town. Tourism-centered development spearheaded by private contractors began in the late 1980s, mostly concentrated north of the fortress, east of the town's main thoroughfare and south of the east-west highway. The area attracts vacationers mostly from other parts of Syria, including a high proportion of Ismailis from other cities. 
Al-Qadmus's political and socio-economic position in the central coastal mountains region significantly decreased after 1970. This was in part due to the promotion of nearby al-Shaykh Badr to a district center that year, which shifted the focus away from al-Qadmus, with villagers in the area going to al-Shaykh Badr for services. Moreover, the gradual development and improvement of transportation infrastructure between Baniyas and its hinterland made it easier for the people of Hammam Wasel, al-Annazah and Talin to travel to Baniyas instead of al-Qadmus.
In early July 2005 confessional violence broke out between some of the Ismaili and Alawite residents of al-Qadmus. The clashes were apparently started after a few young Alawite men began speaking to Ismaili women to the consternation of the latter's male relatives. When the relatives complained to the town's Alawite police commander, he refrained from becoming involved in the dispute. Many in the Alawite community subsequently boycotted Ismaili-owned businesses in al-Qadmus, particularly the furniture stores and sweet shops, and instead opted to purchase from the surrounding markets. The local Ismaili merchants were angered at the severe decrease in their business's profits as a result of the boycott and began hurling stones at Alawite-owned storefronts. Later that evening some Alawite residents retaliated by ransacking and burning down 27 Ismaili-owned businesses, causing damage worth an estimated 10 million Syrian pounds. A 75-year old man from the town was killed in the violence and 13 others were wounded. The clashes ended when two Syrian Army battalions from nearby military bases closed the roads leading to al-Qadmus and detained and questioned about 500 suspects. A civilian delegation from al-Qadmus met with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in an attempt to relieve tensions in the town. The Alawite "nahiyah" ("sub-district") chief of al-Qadmus was replaced by a Christian who was seen as neutral.

Bulgarians in South America

Bulgarians (Spanish and ) have been settling in South America (, "Yuzhna Amerika") as economic emigrants since the late 19th century. Their presence has been documented in Uruguay since 1905, in Argentina since 1906 and in Brazil since the early 20th century.
History and distribution.
The Bulgarian diaspora in South America is strongest in Argentina, where 40,000 people of Bulgarian descent are thought to live, the diaspora itself assessing its size to be at least 80,000. However, according to official data, only around 3,000 people have declared Bulgarian nationality in Argentina. Bulgarians mainly live in Buenos Aires, Berisso, Mar del Plata, Presidencia Roque Sáenz Peña, Las Breñas and Comodoro Rivadavia. The most significant wave of emigration was in the 1920s, following World War I, when over 20,000 Bulgarians (mostly from northern Bulgaria: around Veliko Tarnovo, Lovech, Pleven, Vratsa and Targovishte) settled in Argentina. Some of them formed a compact community in the agricultural Chaco Province, introducing the first tractor to Chaco.
According to estimates, 1,800–5,000 Bulgarians live in Brazil, chiefly in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Porto Alegre and Belo Horizonte, including many Bessarabian Bulgarians and some Bulgarian Jews and Bulgarian Armenians. The most famous Brazilian of Bulgarian origin is President Dilma Rousseff from the Workers' Party. Her father Pétar was born in Gabrovo and, as an active member of the Bulgarian Communist Party in the 1920s, had to flee from Bulgaria in 1929 due to political persecution. Rousseff's wide margin over her rivals sparked a "Dilma fever" in Bulgaria. Although she does not speak Bulgarian she said in an interview that she does feel like a Bulgarian to a certain extent. During her state visit to Bulgaria, on October 5, 2011, Rousseff was awarded Bulgaria’s highest state honour, the Order of Stara Planina.
A notable Bulgarian diaspora also exists in Uruguay, numbering around 2,000. Most Bulgarians in this country live in Montevideo, with some in Fray Bentos, Punta del Este, Maldonado, Durazno and Rocha. In the late 1920s, there were around 4,000 Bulgarians in Uruguay.
A smaller number of Bulgarians have also settled in Chile (today around 150, mostly in Santiago), Venezuela (today around 130), Peru, Paraguay, Colombia. Out of South America, there are also figures for Mexico (today around 250–300, mostly in Mexico City), and Cuba (today around 200, mostly in Havana).

Willis was managing director 1926–1931 and chairman 1924–1930 and one of the most powerful political figures in the state. After a few weeks the paper's name was changed to the "Labor Daily" and was a supporter of Lang Labor.
In 1929 receivers sold "Beckett's Budget" to Labor Daily Ltd. The paper also became the major sponsor of the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership from 1934, with the winners of the competition from 1934 to 1950 being awarded the Labour Daily Cup. From 1 December 1938 the "Labor Daily" became the "Daily News" which lasted until 1941 when it was taken over by "The Daily Telegraph".

American Shale Oil

The American Shale Oil, LLC (AMSO), formerly known as EGL Oil Shale, LLC, is a developer of in-situ shale oil extraction technology based in Rifle, Colorado. It is owned 50% each by Genie Oil and Gas and Total S.A.
History.
EGL Oil Shale was established as a subsidiary of EGL Resources, a privately owned independent oil and gas company with operations in the southwestern United States. In 2006, it was awarded a lease by the United States Bureau of Land Management to develop and demonstrate its in-situ oil shale extraction technology in Western Colorado. On 22 January 2008, IDT Corporation and EGL Resources signed an agreement, according to which IDT acquired 75% of EGL Oil Shale and renamed it AMSO, LLC. AMSO was formed on 15 February 2008. Shortly thereafter, IDT bought an additional 15% of AMSO. Subsequently, on 3 March 2009, French oil major Total bought 50% of AMSO's shares for $3.2 million, with EGL Resources selling their remainder and IDT retaining 50%. IDT's share was subsequently transferred to Genie Energy, which was split off from IDT on October 31, 2011.
In 2007, the company was awarded the Bureau of Land Management oil shale research, development and demonstration lease in Rio Blanco County, Colorado. AMSO started its pilot well in January 2012, but the operations were interrupted shortly afterwards due to technical problems with a 600 kilowatt electric heater.
Technology.
American Shale Oil is developing a process called "Conduction, Convection, Reflux" (CCR) oil shale conversion. The process combines horizontal wells, which are heated by a downhole burner or other means, and other horizontal or vertical wells, which provide both heat transfer through refluxing of generated oil and a means to collect and produce the oil. At the start of the heating process, oil is injected to improve heat transfer. AMSO has proposed that permeability of the formation sufficient for convection will be achieved by thermomechanical fracturing. The original technology proposed by EGL was based on hydraulic fracturing.) 
AMSO believes that by heating the rock more quickly than in the Shell in situ conversion process - 3 to 12 months as opposed to several years - the CCR process will consume less energy and require fewer wells. Researchers at Petrochina who reviewed AMSOs proposed technology in 2008 noted that the output of oil and gas could be faster, but felt that the technical complexity and costs of the proposed technology were shortcomings, and also noted that the fluid flow would be difficult to control and easy to "short-circuit."
Operations.
AMSO's operating office is located in Rifle, Colorado. AMSO is also supported by AMSO and Genie staff at the Genie office in Newark, New Jersey. According to an SEC filing by IDT in October 2011, AMSO had four full-time employees and fixed assets of US$15,000. The company is leasing a test tract in the Piceance Basin from the Bureau of Land Management.
According to Genie Energy's first quarter 2013 financial report:
"In early March 2013, AMSO, LLC initiated start-up of its oil shale pilot test... After approximately two weeks of operation, the down-hole electric heater failed. Pilot operations were too short to allow conclusions to be drawn about the ultimate viability of AMSO, LLC’s approach." In August 2013, AMSO announced that field testing would be delayed by perhaps 12 months to evaluate alternate heating methods.
Management.
The company's chairman and chief executive officer is Howard Jonas, the founder and chairman of IDT Corporation. The president is Claude Pupkin. The chief technology officer and project manager is Alan K. Burnham, and the vice president for operations is Roger L. Day.

RBS TV

RBS TV is a Southern Brazilian television network owned by Grupo RBS, and one of the oldest affiliates to Rede Globo. The acronym originally stands for Rede Brasil Sul de Televisão (English: "Brazil South Television Network"), but currently the network never uses its full name on-air.
RBS TV owns 18 television stations spread over two Brazilian states: 12 in Rio Grande do Sul and 6 in Santa Catarina. It actually operates two distinct networks, one to each state. "RBS TV Porto Alegre" is the headquarters for the Rio Grande do Sul network, whereas the main station of the Santa Catarina network is located in Florianópolis.
RBS TV stations produce an average amount of local and regional programming, composed mainly of news, but also drama series, documentaries, sports, variety and youth programming.
Although most of the programs are produced separately in each of the two state networks, some of them are produced by RBS TV Porto Alegre alone, and broadcast on both states.
History.
"TV Gaúcha" was created in 1962 in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, and would later become "RBS TV Porto Alegre". The following year, TV Gaúcha affiliated itself with Rede Excelsior. Rede Globo was launched in Rio de Janeiro two years later, but TV Gaúcha would only become its affiliate in 1967.
In 1979, it started to operate in Florianópolis, capital city of Santa Catarina. This new purchase obliged the network to change its name to something less Rio Grande do Sul-related (as the word "Gaúcha" was), and it was rebranded "RBS TV" that same year.
Inquiry on RBS Group oligopoly / monopoly practicing.
The RBS Group is being investigated by the practice of oligopoly / monopoly. In 2008, the Federal Prosecutor of Santa Catarina has filed a public civil action (Case No.. 2008.72.00.014043-5) against the company oligopoly Rede Brasil Sul (RBS) in southern Brazil. The MPF requires the company, among other measures, to reducing its number of TV and radion stations in the states of Santa Catarina (SC) and Rio Grande do Sul (RS), so that to be in according to the Brazilian law; and the cancellation of the purchase of the newspaper A Notícia from Joinville, consummated in 2006 - which resulted in a virtual monopoly over the relevant newspapers in the state of Santa Catarina.
In 2009, the Federal Prosecutor in Canoas (RS), Pedro Antonio Roso, asked the chairman of the RBS Group, Nelson Pacheco Sirotsky, among other informations, the number of TV and radio stations that the company owns in Rio Grande do Sul, "as well as its affiliates, stations and repeaters." The request is part of an administrative proceeding brought by federal prosecutors "to determine possible occurrence of monopolistic practices and irregularities in granting Radio and Television to the RBS Group in Rio Grande do Sul".

In the introductory article, the editor criticized modern biblical scholarship as "a toothless tiger or worse yet, covert apologetics wearing the Esau-mask of criticism" and advocated a return to the "golden era of bold hypotheses and daring reconstructions associated with the great names of Baur and Tübingen".
During the journal's first decade, it was sponsored by The Theological School at Drew University. The final issue (volume 10, no. 2) appeared in Fall, 2003.

Serbian Christmas traditions

Serbian Christmas traditions are customs and practices of the Serbs associated with Christmas and a period encompassing it, between the third Sunday before Christmas Day and Epiphany. There are many, complex traditions connected with this period. They vary from place to place, and in many areas have been updated or watered down to suit modern living. The Serbian name for Christmas is "Božić" (Cyrillic: Божић, ), which is the diminutive form of the word "bog" ("god"), and can be translated as "young god". Christmas is celebrated for three consecutive days, starting with Christmas Day, which the Serbs call the first day of Christmas. On these days, one is to greet another person by saying "Christ is Born," which should be responded to with "Truly He is Born," or in Serbian: „"Hristos se rodi"“ – „"Vaistinu se rodi"“ .
Christmas Eve.
The Serbian name for Christmas Eve during the day is "Badnji dan". After sunset it becomes "Badnje veče". On this day, the family makes preparations for the oncoming celebration. The dinner on this day is festive, copious and diverse in foods, although it is prepared in accordance with the rules of fasting.
Badnjak.
The badnjak is an oak log or branch brought into the house and placed on the fire on the evening of Christmas Eve, much like a yule log in other European traditions. There are many regional variations surrounding the customs and practices connected with the badnjak. 
Early in the morning the head of each family, usually accompanied by several male relatives, selects and fells the tree from which the log will be cut for their household. The group announces its departure by firing guns or small celebratory mortars called "prangija". The Turkey oak is the most popular species of tree selected in most regions, but other oaks, or less frequently other kinds of tree, are also chosen. Generally, each household prepares one badnjak, although more are cut in some regions.
When the head of household finds a suitable tree, he stands in front of it facing east. After throwing grain at the tree, he greets it with the words "Good morning and happy Christmas Eve to you", makes the Sign of the Cross, says a prayer, and kisses the tree. He then cuts it slantwise on its eastern side, using an axe. The tree should fall to the east, unhindered by surrounding trees. Its top is removed, leaving the badnjak of such a length that allows it to be carried on a man's shoulder, up to about long. Once in the home, each badnjak is leaned vertically against the house beside the entrance door. In some areas, the badnjak is cut into three logs.
In the evening, a man of the family brings their badnjak into the house. If there is more than one badnjak, the thickest of them is regarded as the main one, and is brought in first. Stepping across the threshold, right foot first, the man greets his gathered family with the words "Good evening and happy Christmas Eve to you." The woman of the house greets him back, saying "May God give you well-being, and may you have good luck", or "Good luck to you, and together with you for many years to come we be", or similar, before throwing grain from a sieve at the man and the badnjak he carries.
Upon entering the house the man approaches the fireplace, called "ognjište" ()—the hearth of an "ognjište" is similar to a campfire, in that it has no vertical surround. He lays the badnjak down on the fire and moves it a little forward, to summon prosperity for the household. Any other logs are brought in by other males and laid on the fire parallel or perpendicular to the first. The head of the household takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" or similar. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. When the log has burnt through, some families let the fire go out, while in others the men keep watch in shifts during the night to keep the badnjak burning.
Another type of the badnjak that has developed among the Serbs has mostly replaced the traditional log, whose burning is usually unfeasible in modern homes. It is a cluster of oak twigs with their brown leaves still attached, with which the home is decorated on the Eve. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of European Cornel and several stalks of straw.
Since the early 1990s the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. There are typically three elements to such celebrations: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of cutting down the tree to be used as the badnjak, taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes Vespers, placing the badnjak on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the badnjak, and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the badnjak not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of gathering around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration has its own specific traits however, reflecting the traditions of the local community.
Christmas straw.
Immediately after the badnjak has been brought in, or immediately before in some places, an armful of straw is spread over the floor. The straw is usually brought in with the same greetings and throwing of grain as the badnjak. The person spreading it may imitate a hen clucking to call her chicks, ""Kvo", "kvo", "kvo"", with the family's children imitating chicks, ""Piju", "piju", "piju"", while they pick at the straw. A common custom is to scatter a handful of walnuts over the straw.
In Petar II Petrović-Njegoš's poem "The Mountain Wreath", the plot of which takes place in 18th-century Montenegro, the holiday atmosphere on Christmas Eve is described through the words of Abbot Stefan, a main character of the poem:
Christmas Eve Dinner.
Once the "badnjak" and straw have been taken into the house, the Christmas Eve dinner may begin. The head of household makes the Sign of the Cross, lights a candle, and censes the whole house. In some regions it is a custom that he then goes out into the yard, calls by name pest animals (e.g. wolves, foxes, and hawks) and his personal enemies, inviting them, "Come to dinner now and again in a year, God willing." This is intended to protect the household from them for a year.
Until the beginning of the 20th century in the Pirot District, south-eastern Serbia, the head of household would go out to his woodpile, where he would invite "German" (pronounced ) – a male mythological being associated with bringing rain and hail. He would take with him a loaf of bread called good luck, prepared particularly for this ritual, rakia, wine, and a wax candle. At the woodpile, he would shout three times, ""German", "German", wherever you are, come to dinner right now, and in the summer do not let me see your eyes anywhere!" He would then light the candle, take a sip of rakia, taste some bread, drink wine, and go back into his house. Asked what happened with "German", he would answer, "He came, so we dined and drank amply of rakia and wine, and then we parted." This ritual was intended to prevent summer hailstorms.
Before the table is served, it is strewn with a thin layer of straw and covered with a white cloth. The family members sit down at the table. Prior to tucking in, they all rise and a man or boy among them says a prayer, or they together sing the Troparion of the Nativity in Church Slavonic language:
Christmas Eve being a fast day, the dinner is prepared in accordance with that, but it is copious and diverse in foods. Besides a round unleavened loaf of bread called "badnjački kolač", and salt, which are necessary, this meal may comprise roast fish, cooked beans, sauerkraut, noodles with ground walnuts, honey, and wine. It used to be served in some villages on a sack filled with straw, with the family seated around it on the floor. In the north Dalmatian region of Bukovica, a part of food that remained after the dinner used to be put on a potsherd, and taken to the rubbish heap. Wolf was there invited for dinner, "My dear wolf, do not slaughter my sheep, here you are groats! Here you are yours, and leave mine alone!"
Following dinner, young people visit their friends, a group of whom may gather at the house of one of them. The elderly narrate stories form the olden times. Christmas songs are sung, in which Christmas is treated as a male personage. The Serbian name for Christmas is "Božić", which is the diminutive form of the noun "bog" "god", and can be translated as "young god". An old Christmas song from the Bay of Kotor has the following lyrics:
The following song is sung in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the evening before Christmas Day:
It is a custom in the region of Banat that, after Christmas Eve dinner, groups of children go from house to house of their neighborhood and sing to neighbors. This custom is called "korinđanje", and the children who participate in it are called "korinđaši". They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when the neighbor comes out they greet him, and ask if they are allowed to sing. If the answer is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity. As a reward, the neighbor gives them candies or even money; more traditional gifts include walnuts, prunes, apples, and cakes. Not only can Serbian children be "korinđaši", but also Romanian and Hungarian ones.
In central Serbia, once the household members have gone to bed, an elderly woman of the family sticks a knife into the house door from the inside. Alternatively, she puts a hawthorn stake by the door, hanging a wreath of garlic on it. This is done as a protection against curses, witches, and demons. For the same reason, children are rubbed with garlic on the palms, armpits, and soles before going to bed. In some regions, the men keep watch in shifts by the fireplace during the night, to keep the fire burning.
Christmas.
On Christmas Day, the celebration is announced at dawn by church bells, and by shooting from guns and "prangijas". The head of household and some of the family go to church to attend the Morning Liturgy. No one is to eat anything before tasting the prosphora, which the head of household brings from church for those who stay at home to do domestic tasks for this morning.
The Serbs native to the Slovenian region of White Carniola try to see only healthy and prosperous people on this day. The Serbs of Timiş County in Romania have since the interwar period adopted the custom of erecting in their homes a Christmas tree, which they call "krisindla", after the German "Christkindl". On Christmas Day children sing little songs, at the beginning of which Christmas is said to knock or tread loudly. This may be understood as a theophany: by the sound, Young God makes his arrival known to people. The following are the lyrics of two of such songs:
"Polaznik".
A "polaznik", "polažajnik", "polaženik", or "radovan", is the first person who visits the family on Christmas Day. This visit may be fortuitous or pre-arranged. People expect that it will summon prosperity and well-being for their household in the ensuing year. A family often picks in advance a man or boy, and arranges that he visit them on Christmas morning. If this proves to be lucky for the family, he is invited again next year to be the "polaznik". If not, they send word to him not to come any more in that capacity.
A "polaznik" steps into the house with his right foot first, greeting the gathered family, "Christ is Born, Happy Christmas." He carries grain in his glove, which he shakes out before the threshold, or throws at the family members. They respond with "Truly He is Born," and throw grain at the "polaznik". He then approaches the fireplace, takes a poker or a branch, and strikes repeatedly the burning "badnjak" to make sparks fly from it. At the same time he utters these words (or similar):
Having said that, he moves the log a little forward and throws a coin into the fire. The woman of the house puts a woolen blanket on the "polaznik"'s back, and seats him on a low stool by the fireplace. In the moment when he sits down, they try to pull away the stool beneath him, as if to make him fall on the floor. The "polaznik" goes out into the yard, and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of household on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The "polaznik" usually stays for dinner with the family. He receives a gift in the form of a round cake with an embedded coin, and a towel, shirt, socks, or some other useful thing.
A custom to use a domestic animal as a "polaznik" was kept in some regions until the first half of the 20th century. A sheep, ox, swine, or calf was led into the house on Christmas morning. In the west Serbian region of Rađevina, centered on the town of Krupanj, the head of household would place a sheep between himself and the fireplace, and pronounce the aforementioned words while striking the "badnjak" with a branch cut from it. In the region of Bihor, north-eastern Montenegro, a round loaf of bread with a hole in its center was prepared; four grooves were impressed into its surface along two mutually perpendicular diameters of the loaf. After an ox was led into the house, the loaf was put on his horn, and some grain was thrown on the ox. Yanking his head, the ox would throw off the loaf; having fallen down, the loaf would break into four pieces along the grooves. The pieces were picked up and distributed among the family members. This custom was preserved up to the 1950s even in some Muslim families of the region. Ethnologists consider that the animal "polažajnik" is more ancient than the human one.
Strong water.
A girl or woman goes early in the morning to a resource of water, as a well, spring, or stream. After she puts by the water an ear of maize and a bunch of basil which she has brought from home, she collects water with a bucket, and takes it home to her family. This water collected on early Christmas morning is called the strong water, and is believed to possess a special beneficial power. Each member of the family washes the face with it, and drinks it before breakfast; infants are bathed in it. On her way back home, the girl who carries the strong water picks several cornel or willow twigs, with which children are lightly struck that morning. This is intended to strengthen their health.
Christmas dinner.
"Česnica".
An indispensable part of Christmas dinner is the "česnica", a round loaf of bread. The preparation of this bread may be accompanied by various rules and rituals. The dough for it is sometimes prepared with the strong water. A widespread custom is to put a coin into the dough; regionally, little objects made of cornel wood may be inserted, representing chickens, oxen, cows, swine, bees, etc.
In addition to the "česnica", other kinds of Christmas loaves may be baked, each with its specific name and purpose within the celebration. The "božićni kolač" is a round loaf with a Christogram impressed with a wooden seal on its upper surface. For each male member of the family a round loaf named "ratarica" may be prepared – the biggest one for the head, and the smallest one for the youngest boy. For each female member a "pletenica" may be baked, a loaf shaped like a three-strand braid
"Pečenica".
On Christmas Eve, the men of the family build a fire in their house yard, and roast a pig, or a sheep in some areas, on a long wooden spit. The whole roasted pig or sheep, called "pečenica", is a traditional part of Christmas dinner. People who raise their own swine dedicate one for the "pečenica" a month or two before, and feed it with better fodder. It used to be killed on "Tucindan", the day before Christmas Eve, by hitting on the head with a lump of salt. Its throat was then cut, the blood being collected and mixed with fodder. Feeding cattle with this mixture was believed to make them thrive. The name "Tucindan" is derived from the verb "tući" "to beat". The roasted "pečenica" may be brought into the house with a ritual similar to that of bringing in the "badnjak".
Meal.
Christmas dinner is the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. Аbout noon, or even earlier, the family members sit down at the table. When the head of household gives a sign, all rise. He lights a candle, censes his family and house, and prays the Lord's Prayer. After that, the family members kiss each other on the cheek saying, "The peace of God among us, Christ is Born." The head and another man of the family hold the "česnica" between themselves, rotating it three times counterclockwise. The "česnica" is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his or her own share of the loaf. The family member whose share contains the coin hidden in the "česnica", will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The main course of Christmas dinner is roast pork of the "pečenica". During the dinner, the head of household proposes a toast to his family with a glass of wine, several times. A traditional toast from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina goes like this:
After Christmas dinner, the remaining food should not be removed from the table – only the used tableware is taken away. The food is covered with a white cloth, and eaten in the evening as supper.
"Koleda".
The "koleda" was a custom that a group of young men, masked and costumed, went from house to house of their village singing special "koleda" songs and performing acts of magic intended to summon health, wealth, and prosperity for each household. The members of the group were called "koledari". The "koleda" was carried out from the Feast of Saint Ignatius Theophorus (five days before Christmas) up until the Epiphany. This custom was best preserved in the upper Pčinja District, and in the region around the River South Morava in the Jablanica District, southeastern Serbia. Regarded as pagan and discouraged by the Serbian Orthodox Church, the "koleda" ceased to be performed among most of the Serbs during the 19th and 20th centuries.
"Koledari" prepared themselves during several days before the start of the "koleda": they practiced the "koleda" songs, and made their masks and costumes. The masks could be classified into three types according to the characters they represented: the anthropomorphic, the zoomorphic (representing bear, cow, stag, goat, sheep, ox, wolf, stork, etc.), and the anthropo-zoomorphic. The main material from which they were produced was hide. The face, however, could be made separately out of a dried gourd shell or a piece of wood, and then sewn to hide so that the mask could cover all the head. The moustache, beard, and eyebrows were made with black wool, horsehair, or hemp fibers, and the teeth with beans. Zoomorphic and anthropo-zoomorphic masks might have white, black, or red painted horns attached to them. The costumes were prepared from ragged clothes, sheepskins with the wool turned outside, and calf hides. An ox tail with a bell fixed at its end was sometimes attached at the back of them.
The leader of the group was called Grandpa. The other "koledari" gathered at his house on the eve of "koleda", and at midnight they all went out and started their activities. Walking through the streets of the village they shouted and made noise with their bells and ratchets. Most were armed with sabers or clubs. One of them, called Bride, was masked and costumed as a pregnant woman. He held a distaff in his hand and spun hemp fibers. The "koledari" teased and joked with Bride, which gave a comic note to the "koleda". Some of them were called "alosniks", the men possessed by the demon ala. There could have been other named characters in the group.
The "koledari" sung special songs, in which the word "koledo", the vocative case of "koleda", was inserted in the middle and at the end of each verse. Vuk Stefanović Karadžić recorded in the 19th century the lyrics of a number of the "koleda" songs, including the following one, which "koledari" sung while entering a house:
In the following song, also recorded by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, the "badnjak" and Christmas were referred to as male personages. An opposition was made between the former, described as old, and the latter, described as young. "Koledari" sung it to the household head in whose home they came:
Besides the singing, the "koledari" also chased away demons from the household. First they searched the house to find out where the demons hide. They looked everywhere, at the same time shouting, dancing, jumping, knocking on the floor and walls with sticks, and teasing Bride. When they found the demons, they drove them out of the hiding place, and fought with them swinging their sabers and clubs. After the demons were chased away, the "koledari" briefly danced the kolo, and then blessed the household. As a reward, they received a loaf of bread which the family prepared specially for them, and other food gifts.
"Vertep".
On Christmas Eve and Day, a group of boys dressed in variegated costumes goes from house to house of their village carrying a "vertep"—a litter constructed as a wooden model of a house or a church. The name "vertep" comes from the Church Slavonic вєртє́пъ "cave", referring to the cave that housed the manger in which newborn Jesus Christ was laid. There are two dolls inside the litter: one represents the Theotokos, and the other, laid in a model of a manger, represents the Christ Child; the floor is spread with straw. This custom is called "vertep", and the boys participating in it are the "vertepaši". In front of each house they sing Christmas songs, and recite poems that praise the birth of Christ. Similarly to "koledari", "vertepaši" are armed with wooden swords and fence with each other in front of houses. "Vertep" could be regarded as a Christianized form of the "koleda". This custom is mainly present among the Serbs of Vojvodina.
Second and third day of Christmas.
Christmas is celebrated for three days. On the second day of Christmas, neighbors visit each other. On the third day, Christmas straw is taken out of the house. Little bundles are made with it, and hung on fruit trees to make them fruit better. A bigger bundle may be stored in a dry place: it will be burned on St. George's Day, as a protection of fields against hail. Another bundle is taken away across the nearest stream – a symbolic elimination of all the vermin that may be present in the house. Men make crosses from the remnant of the thicker side of "badnjak", and stick them under eaves, on fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries. It is believed this will help that the ensuing year be happy and fruitful. A good sign that this will be the case is when there is a lot of snow on Christmas Day.
The third day of Christmas coincides with St. Stephen's Day, which is the slava of many Serbian families. It is also the slava of Republika Srpska. In this way, many Serbs celebrate two important holidays, Christmas and slava, within three days.
Twelve Days of Christmas.
During the Twelve Days of Christmas (7 January – 18 January on the Gregorian calendar), one is to greet another person with "Christ is Born," which should be responded to with "Truly He is Born," or in Serbian: „"Hristos se rodi"“ (pronounced ) – „"Vaistinu se rodi"“ . 
January 14 on the Gregorian calendar corresponds to January 1, New Year's Day, on the Julian calendar; this holiday is also called "Mali Božić" "Little Christmas". In some regions, the head and the right Boston butt of the "pečenica" are set aside at the Christmas dinner, and are served for dinner on this day. A part of this meal may consist of little round loaves made with cornmeal and cream. The loaves are named "vasilica" after Saint Basil the Great, because January 1 is also the feast day of this saint. People versed in scapulimancy used the shoulder blade of the Boston butt to foretell events concerning the family in the ensuing year. The snout cut from the head of "pečenica" could have been used in love magic. If a girl looked stealthily through the snout at a boy she wanted, who was not interested in her, he would supposedly go mad about her.
On the day before Little Christmas, especially in south-eastern Serbia, a group of young unmarried men went through the streets of their village and chased away demons by making a deafening noise. "Sirovari", as these men were called, shouted as loud as possible two words, ""Sirovo burovo"!" accompanied by the noise made with bells, ratchets, and horseshoes strung on a rope. The group consisted of seven, nine or eleven members; it was said that if there were an even number of "sirovari", one of them would die within a year. Moving through the village, they tried to make it impossible for anyone to count them. They constantly changed positions in the group, hid and suddenly reappeared. Villagers were glad to receive them in their homes, and treated them with food and drink.
The following custom was recorded at the end of the 19th century in the north Dalmatian region of Bukovica. Early in the morning of Little Christmas, children of the family spread Christmas straw from their house around the stake in the center of their village's threshing floor. The use of this stake was to tether a horse to it; the animal was then driven around to thresh grain by treading with its hooves. The woman of the house baked a big round unleavened loaf of bread with a hole in its center, inscribed with circles, crosses, hooks, and other symbols on its surface. The loaf was taken to the threshing floor, and fixed round the stake. The oldest man of the family would take hold of the stake with his right hand above the loaf. With his left hand he held the right hand of the next oldest man, and so on to the youngest boy who could walk steadily. Holding hands in this manner, they would run around the stake three times. During the running they would shout in unison as loud as possible, ""Ajd ajde, koba moja!"" meaning "Giddy-up, my mare!" – except for the man holding the stake, who would shout, ""De! De! De!"" meaning "Go! Go! Go!" They would then take the hollow loaf back home, and put it near the fireplace beside the remnant of "badnjak". The woman of the house would "feed them fodder", i.e., prepare a meal for them, consisting of "đevenica" (a sort of dried sausage), roast pork, and the hollow loaf, plus rakia for the adults. Having eaten, they would go back to the threshing floor and repeat the whole ritual, only this time without the loaf. In the end, they would collect Christmas straw from the threshing floor; it was put in hens' nests to prevent them from laying eggs outside the nests. This custom was considered as especially joyful for children.
The last of the Twelve Days of Christmas, January 18 (January 5 on the Julian calendar), is the eve of the Epiphany. Its folk name is "Krstovdan" – the Day of the Cross. This is a strict fast day; the adults should eat almost nothing. It was believed that the north, south, east, and west winds crossed each other on "Krstovdan". The wind that overpowered the other three, would be dominant in the ensuing year.
This twelve-day period used to be called the unbaptized days, during which the demonic forces of all kinds were considered to be more than usually active and dangerous. People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the demons called "karakondžula", imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. When a "karakondžula" found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on his back, and make him carry it wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.
Gifts.
Gift giving on Christmas is not a Serbian tradition—instead, gifts are given on the three Sundays before Christmas Day. These three holidays are called "Detinjci" or "Djetinjci", "Materice", and "Oci". Children give gifts on "Detinjci", married women on "Materice", and married men on "Oci". The best presents are exchanged between parents and their children.
The gifts are given in the form of a ransom. In the morning of "Detinjci", the adults use a belt, rope, or scarf to tie their and neighbors' children, binding their legs. The children have already prepared presents for this event, with which they "pay the ransom" and get untied. In the morning of "Materice", the children suddenly tie their mother, who asks, as if surprised, why she has been tied. The children then wish a happy Feast of "Materice" to her, and she pays the ransom with the prepared presents. They may do the same with married women from their neighborhood. Mothers prepare a family feast on this day. In the morning of "Oci", the Sunday immediately before Christmas Day, the children tie their father. Out of these three holidays, "Materice" is the most festive. It's worth noting that majority of Serbian population however does not follow the traditions of "Detinjci, Materice and Oci". Churches in small rural villages will usually provide local children with gifts before Christmas.

Pearce v. Ham

Pearce v. Ham, , was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Illinois regarding a bill filed by Charles I. Ham, the appellee, against Isaac N. Pearce and Andrew J. Kuykendall, the appellants. Originally, one Joseph K. Frick contracted with the County Court of Johnson County in the State of Illinois, where he agreed to build, according to certain plans and specifications, a courthouse for said county at Vienna, the county seat, furnishing the material and completing it by the first Monday of September 1870, in consideration whereof the county court agreed to pay him $38,357 in the bonds of Johnson county, bearing ten percent interest, and due in six years. Frick never did any work on the building, and, owing to some misunderstanding with the county court, abandoned the contract and told Kuykendall that he might go on and build the courthouse if he chose to do so. On September 9, 1869, Kuykendall, as the agent and attorney in fact of Frick, assigned the contract of the latter to Ham and Pearce, Ham being the appellee, and Pearce one of the appellants, who had formed a partnership for the purpose of building the courthouse under said contract.
Frick contracted with a county to construct a public building, and gave bond with Kuykendall as surety for the performance of the contract. Frick abandoned the contract. After procuring some modifications in it at request of Ham, Kuykendall assigned the contract to Pearce and Ham as partners with equal interests. Pearce and Ham agreed with Wickwire to construct the building. Ham then left the vicinity and engaged in other work elsewhere. Wickwire constructed the building. Kuykendall received the compensation under the original contract, paid Wickwire in full for the work done by him, and divided the profits with Pearce, claiming to be partner. Held that Ham could recover one-half of the profits from Pearce and from Kuykendall.
The object of the suit was to obtain an account of what was due to Ham by virtue of his said partnership and partnership enterprise, and that Pearce and Kuykendall might be decreed to pay him what might be found due on such accounting either in cash or Johnson county bonds.
Upon final hearing upon the pleadings and evidence, the circuit court rendered a decree in favor of Ham against Kuykendall and Pearce for $5,001. The appeal of Kuykendall and Pearce brings that decree under review.
The high court found that The entire profits were appropriated by Pearce and Kuykendall, and they must account to Ham for his share and the Decree was affirmed.

The scholarship is awarded to the Fourth Year cadet at the Royal Military College of Canada who is considered the most deserving of those who accept a regular commission in the military occupation of Aerospace Controller by reason of academic standing, character, and proficiency in classification training.

Buscando a Miguel

Buscando a Miguel () is a 2007 Colombian drama film written and directed by Juan Fisher. Based on a true story, looking for Miguel is Fisher’s second work as director. The film is a stark comedy-drama about identity and the different facets of Colombian society.
Plot.
Miguel is a young and very ambitious Colombian politician with a brilliant career ahead of him. Born from a wealthy family, he sees the world from a position of privilege and is blind to the reality of those around him. Miguel has let the wheels in motion to run for office, but fate, it seems has other plans.
After falling victim to a violent attack; a naked, unidentified and unconscious Miguel is laid out before a doctor as a John Doe. He unexpectedly revives in the autopsy room leaving those standing before him in shock, but no more shocked than Miguel himself, empty of memories, a name, a destination. He eventually escapes but discovers that he has no memories; he does not know who he is. He searches for himself in an unknown city among people he does not know, living through fragmentary images of his past and dreams he cannot understand.
In a dream state, this utter unawareness of himself, Miguel is thrown into the harsh reality of the streets, a world inhabited by the very people he once refused to acknowledge. To his rescue, a cast of colorful indigents, petty thieves and a pious and promiscuous drag queen; with them he experiences the warmth of friendship, even when he is no one, a stranger even to himself. Miguel, the politician, has ceased to exist. Bubbling to the surface is the raw and essential Miguel – a man struggling to find redemption.
