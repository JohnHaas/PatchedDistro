Production.
On March 13, 2008, it was announced that The CW was developing a contemporary spin-off of "Beverly Hills, 90210", which first aired on Fox from October 1990 to May 2000. The project was put on the fast track by the network, and an order of the pilot was expected by the end of the month. The "Beverly Hills, 90210" creator, Darren Star, was announced not to be involved with the project, as well as producer Aaron Spelling, who died in 2006. The only surviving element from the original series was the Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency which masterminded the spin-off idea. A detailed breakdown of the pilot written by Thomas was released on March 17, containing information on the plot and characters of the series. None of the characters were related to the original series; however, the series' featured a similar premise: a family with two teenagers who recently moved from the Midwest to Beverly Hills. To reflect the situation at the Beverly Hills school, where around 40 percent of the students were from Persian descent, a student named Navid Shirazi was created. Thomas intended to introduce The Peach Pit, the diner from "Beverly Hills, 90210", but noted that it would not be featured in the pilot. The writer considered giving the siblings a job at a movie theater, as he did not want them to use their parent's credit cards. On April 14, Thomas announced that he was leaving the series to focus on his two pilots for ABC. Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah were hired as the new executive producers and wrote a new version of the script in late April. Sachs said that although Thomas had a "great script", their version of the script was edgier. 
On May 11, one day before The CW's upfront presentations, the network officially picked up the series for the 2008–2009 television season. The CW gave the series a full-season order after airing just four episodes. After disagreeing with the network executives over the series' storylines, Sachs and Judah resigned as writers. The CW wanted the series to have a female perspective and focus more on money and glamor; however, Judah and Sachs were more comfortable writing for men. Instead, Judah began working on postproduction, including editing and music supervision, while Sachs ran the production on set. The CW hired Rebecca Rand Sinclair to retool the series as head writer. In late February 2009, Sinclair took over as executive producer.
Filming for the series usually took place in numerous high schools in Torrance and El Segundo, although several scenes were filmed in Torrance High School because of its large auditorium.
Cast.
With the press release for The CW's 2008–09 season, Rob Estes, Shenae Grimes, Tristan Wilds, AnnaLynne McCord, Dustin Milligan, Ryan Eggold, Jessica Stroup, Michael Steger, Lori Loughlin and Jessica Walter were announced as the regulars for the first season.
The producers wanted to see "as many of the original cast members as possible", but were careful not to "parade them all out in the pilot". Following rumors of cast members from "Beverley Hills, 90210" appearing on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty would be returning in a recurring role as her original character. Sachs met with Doherty over dinner, and told her about the "90210" spin-off. Over the next few weeks, they established Brenda's backstory and Doherty agreed to guest star in several episodes. Doherty and Garth told reporters that they were nervous about reuniting and filming scenes together for the "90210" spin-off. While starring in the original series, the actresses were known for feuding on and off the set, which lead to Doherty leaving the series in 1994. The pair had not spoken for years before filming their first scene together, and commented on the amount of buildup and nerves leading towards their first meeting. Doherty commented, "I think when you're 18, your personalities conflict, then you meet up 10 or 15 years later, and the playing ground is totally different and you're fine."
Other guest stars include Kellan Lutz, Meghan Markle, Maeve Quinlan as Adrianna's mother Constance, Josh Henderson as Sean, a young man who claimed to be Harry's biological son with Tracy Clark, but was really a scam artist, Lauren London as cheerleader Christina, and Aimee Teegarden as Rhonda, a West Beverley student.
Jessica Walter was written out of the series in episode thirteen due to "financial reasons," while Jessica Lowndes was upgraded to series regular in her place.
Story.
Jeff Judah said that they were trying to ground their script in reality, with real character stories and emotional stories. The writers wanted the audience to relate to the characters' problems, which they wanted to be truthful and emotional, but also comedic. The pair were interested in telling several stories simultaneously, featuring many characters. Sachs and Judah found the parents to be an important part of the series, and designed to be contemporary parents. Since the producers were both fathers, they designed the script to include more prominent adult story lines and a strong point of view on parenting. Judah was interested in focusing on how the family kept their moral center when moving to Beverly Hills, and the way the parents dealt with their teenagers.
Reception.
The series debuted to 4.7 million viewers and a 2.6 Adults 18–49, winning the night in all key demos, to become The CW's highest rated premiere. It also matched the highest 18–49 numbers set by "America's Next Top Model". The season averaged 2.24 million viewers and a 0.9 Adults 18–49 rating in the United States each week. The show also debuted strongly for E4 in the UK, with 468,000 viewers tuning for the pilot episode.
The first season holds a 46/100 rating on Metacritic, indicating generally mixed reviews.
In New Zealand, 90210 debuted on TV3 on October 15, 2008 at 7.30pm then on 
November 12, 2008 the show was shifted to Four.
DVD release.
The DVD release of season one was released after the season has completed broadcast on television. It has been released in Regions 1, 2 and 4. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material such as deleted scenes, gag reels and behind-the-scenes featurettes.

1948 Fukui earthquake

The was a major earthquake in Fukui Prefecture, Japan. The magnitude 7.3 quake struck at 5:13 p.m.(JDT) on June 28, 1948. The strongest shaking occurred in the city of Fukui, where it was recorded as 6 (equivalent to the current 7) on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale. The coordinates of the earthquake were 36゜10.3'N　136゜17.4'E (around the town of Maruoka).
Geology.
This earthquake was caused by a strike-slip fault that was unknown until this earthquake. The fault stretches from Kanazu to Fukui, long, and was later named the "Fukui Earthquake Fault". Shaking was felt as far as Mito in the east, and Saga in the west.
Relation to other earthquakes.
Some seismologists say that the 1961 Gifu Earthquake, the 1969 Gifu Earthquake, the 1984 Otaki earthquake, and this earthquake were a series of related earthquakes.
Damage.
Damage was most reported in the Fukui plain, where the building collapse rate was more than 60%, since shaking became larger due to it being an alluvial plain, and many of the buildings were just built after the war and a little unstable.
At the time many people were cooking so after the earthquake many fires spread. Since the roads and the waterworks were damaged it took 5 days to put out the fires and so the fires caused devastating damage.
Even though the Daiwa Department Store collapsed, the Fukui Bank building right next to it had no significant damage. It is thought to have been because the Fukui Bank building had about 500 deep foundation pipes 10 meters deep in the ground.
Almost all of the farmers' houses in the epicenter area collapsed, but most of the farmers were outside so there were not many casualties.
Casualties.
At the time, it was the deadliest earthquake after the Pacific War (now preceded by the Great Hanshin earthquake and the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami). This earthquake killed 3769 people, mainly in Sakai City (then part of Fukui City), where the death rate was more than 1%.

Suitable reasonable employment (UK)

Suitable reasonable employment is a concept which is used in United Kingdom redundancy scenarios.
It occurs when a job has been made redundant and the employer offers the redundant job holder an alternative position. If the position is within the skills and capabilities of the individual, has similar terms and conditions, is at a similar level, and is locationally appropriate, the chances are that they will be obliged to take it.
An employee who unreasonably refuses an offer of suitable alternative employment will not normally be entitled to redundancy pay.
It is also the case that if the employer has a vacant position available which is within the skills and experience of a redundant employee, they should offer that position as a suitable reasonable alternative.

Blinatumomab

Blinatumomab (MT103) is a drug that has anti-cancer properties. It belongs to a new class of constructed monoclonal antibodies, bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), that exert action selectively and direct the human immune system to act against tumor cells. Blinatumomab specifically targets the CD19 antigen present on B cells.
The drug was developed by a German-American company Micromet, Inc. in cooperation with Lonza.
Structure and mechanism of action.
Blinatumomab enables a patient's T cells to recognize malign B cells. A molecule of blinatumomab combines two binding sites: a CD3 site for T cells and a CD19 site for the target B cells. CD3 is part of the T cell receptor. The drug works by linking these two cell types and activating the T cell to exert cytotoxic activity on the target cell.
Therapeutic use.
Clinical trials.
In a phase 1 clinical study with blinatumomab, patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed tumor regression, and in some cases complete remission. There are ongoing phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials of blinatumomab in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lung or gastrointestinal cancers. One phase II trial for ALL reported good results in 2010 and another is starting.

Bay of Plenty Steamers

The Bay of Plenty Steamers are the top representative team under the Bay of Plenty Rugby Union in New Zealand. They compete in the ITM Cup. They have a total of 20 All Blacks, the latest being Sam Cane in 2012. They are coached by Kevin Schuler.
Current squad.
On 24 June, the Steamers named a 33-man squad for the 2013 ITM Cup season. Jamie Nutbrown, Phil Burleigh and Jesse Acton were not considered due to injury. One addtional outside-back will be added to the squad at a later date.
History.
Bay of Plenty is a proud rugby union that has contributed richly to the long and distinguished history of the game in New Zealand. The union who were the inaugural winners of the NPC in 1976 and have experienced equal measures of agony and ecstasy throughout its history.
Representative players.
Bay of Plenty based players were amongst the most prominent in the formative years of the game, but it was not until 1911 that the Bay of Plenty union was fully affiliated to the national body. Up until this time the BOP union was included within the South Auckland union boundaries. The union achieved its first national representation when A.L. McLean was selected for the All Blacks in 1921. McLean was the first of 16 men who have represented New Zealand while wearing the blue and gold hoops, Tanerau Latimer has been the latest to represent the Steamers at international level with a selection for the 2009 Iveco Series. As the heartland of Maori rugby the region has produced a large number of Maori All Blacks.
Bay of Plenty and major matches.
Bay of Plenty has a proud history of rising to the occasion for major matches, on many occasions, often as part of combined teams in the first half of the 20th century, the Bay has pushed touring teams to the limit in memorable encounters that have ranked as the toughest provincial matches on tour. Although often gallant in defeat the Bay has also recorded some memorable victories over stronger opposition - the 1982 Wallabies were thrashed by 40-16 in Rotorua a week after having defeated the All Blacks, and again in 1990 the same nation was lowered 12-4.
Ranfurly Shield.
Bay of Plenty has also challenged many times for the Ranfurly Shield. In 2004 Bay of Plenty won the Ranfurly Shield over Auckland 33-28 at Eden Park to win it for the first time. They would defend it against Waikato 26-20 at Mt Maunganui before losing it two weeks later to Canterbury 26-33. 
A year later Bay of Plenty would challenge Canterbury in Christchurch, however Bay of Plenty lost 13-40. 
The last time Bay of Plenty had challenged for the Ranfurly Shield was in 2005. They are the only team in the ITM Cup not to have challenge for the Ranfurly Shield during the Air New Zealand Cup/ITM Cup period.
Late NPC.
Bay of Plenty also has distinction of being the first side to ever win the NPC when it triumphed in 1976. From the heights of '76 came the depths of 1977 with relegation to the second division, but came straight back up the following year. Fortunes fluctuated until 1991 when defeat by King Country sent the Bay back to Division II where it remained until the 2000 season. The Steamers defeated second division rivals Nelson Bays in a titanic final at the Tauranga Domain in late October 2000, and returned to the top division for the first time in ten years. 
Bay of Plenty began the 2001 NPC division 1 season with an upset win over the defending champions Wellington 14-11 in the Capital. 
Bay of Plenty would only win one more came that season defending Counties Manukau in Tauranga. They would play second division winners
Hawkes Bay in a promotion/relegation match winning 32-12 in Rotorua.
The 2002 season was a roller coaster ride for the Steamers, as they would only win one match beating Southland 24-11 in Tauranga. Again
Bay of Plenty would play Hawke's Bayin a promotion/relegation match at the Rotorua International Stadium.
Bay of Plenty won 37-21 to stay in the NPC Division 1 for 2003.
The following two years were some of the best years for the Steamers since 1976. The team finished 5th in '03 and the season included wins over North Harbour, Northland, Southland, Taranaki, and the first win over Auckland in 23 years.
'04 was even better- with an historic Ranfurly Shield challenge and victory over Auckland in Round 1 of the Air NZ NPC- the first time in their 103 year history that the Bay have held NZ rugby’s most prized trophy. A successful defence against Waikato saw a huge crowd at Mount Maunganui’s Blue Chip Stadium, before Canterbury finally wrestled the Shield away in an epic battle which went right down to the final whistle when Grant McQuoid was millimeters away from securing a draw. All remaining games though were won home and away, securing a semi final against Canterbury, this time at Jade Stadium against a full opposition. Canterbury were too strong, but against public expectation, Bay of Plenty’s 3rd place finish in the Air NZ NPC capped off an amazing year and saw several Bay players achieve Super Rugby selection.
2005 wasn't quite the success that 2004 was. A highlight was hosting the first match in the DHL NZ Lions Series at Rotorua on June 4. The Bay came back from a 17-0 deficit to go in at halftime level. The lack of games prior to this match however took its toll, with the Lions going on to win 34-20.
The of the 2005 Air NZ NPC was an up and down affair resulting in wins over Taranaki, Waikato and Northland- and some close run losses to Southland and Wellington and a final position of 8th on the table.
Air New Zealand/ITM Cup.
In 2006 the national provincial competition was revamped. Four Second Division teams would be promoted to the Air New Zealand cup.
Bay of Plenty would reach the quarter-finals losing to Auckland 45-14 at Eden Park.
2007 was a dreadful year for the Steamers winning only one match and finishing 13th.
2008 was a better year for the Steamers winning there first four matches and finishing 4th. They hosted the quarter finals where they lost to Southland 45-11 at Mt Maunganui.
2009 began like 2008 with the Steamers winning there first four matches. They would win against significant opposition including Wellington, Waikato and Canterbury, However disappointing losses to North Harbour, Otago and Taranaki would see the Steamers finish 7th. 
The quarter finals were scrapped from 2009.
Bay of Plenty would have mixed results in 2010. They would win seven of thirteen matches including a rare win in Wellington.
Disappointing losses to Tasman and Northland would see Bay of Plenty finish in 6th position.
In 2011 Bay of Plenty competed in the new reformatted ITM Cup Premiership. It was also Bay of Plenty's rugby centenary year. Bay of Plenty would have significant wins over Waikato (36-8), Wellington (32-0) and Canterbury (35-31) to see the Steamers finish 4th. However due to the 2011 Rugby World Cup the semi finals were scrapped.
2012 was a disappointing year for the Steamers as they would win three from ten matches and narrowly survive relegation to the championship. The highlight of the Steamers season was defeating Auckland 37-16 in Rotorua to win the new John Drake Memorial Trophy, since its existence from 2009, celebrating the late life of rugby great John Drake. It was Bay of Plenty's first win over Auckland in eight years and the Steamers biggest win against Auckland.
The ghosts of 2007 would repeat for the steamers in 2013. They would win only won match and were relegated to the Championship for 2014.
Stadia.
As being a larger region than most, the Steamers are one of the few teams to have two home stadiums, the Baypark Stadium in Tauranga and Rotorua International Stadium in Rotorua.
Baypark Stadium.
Built in 2000, opened in 2001 and formerly known as Bluechip stadium, Baypark stadium is a muiti-purpose stadium that the Steamers along with Rotorua International Stadium. It has a capacity of 19,800, which was almost attained when Bay of Plenty had the Ranfurly Shield run of 2004.
Rotorua International Stadium.
With a capacity of 34,000, Rotorua International Stadium is one of the larger stadiums in New Zealand, but doesn't get the matches that will draw the crowds. It is one of the two stadiums that the Steamers use as a home field, with many considering it the home of Bay of Plenty Rugby. It is also known as "The Hangi Pit", because of the mud-pools around Rotorua.
Previous seasons.
A table showing the Bay of Plenty Steamers placing in previous Air New Zealand Cup/NPC competitions.
Ranfurly Shield.
The Steamers have been unlucky at times with the Ranfurly Shield. However, 2004 saw this changed when the Bay successfully lifted the 'Log' from Auckland on August 15.

Australian Tourist Trophy

The Australian Tourist Trophy is a CAMS sanctioned national motor racing title for sports car drivers. The title was awarded for the first time in 1956 and then annually from 1958 until the introduction by CAMS of an Australian Sports Car Championship for 1969. It was reinstituted in 1975, restricted for the first time to Production Sports Cars and contested over two heats rather than as a single race. In 1976, with the Production Sports Car class now contesting the Australian Sports Car Championship, the Australian Tourist Trophy once again became a contest for purpose built Group A Sports Cars until it was discontinued after the 1979 event. 
After almost thirty years, the ATT title was again revived with the award going to the winner of the 2007 Sandown GT Classic. For 2008 it was again bestowed upon the winner of the Sandown GT Classic. Each year since 2009 the Trophy has been awarded to the driver accumulating the most outright championship points at specified rounds of the annual Australian GT Championship.

<doc id="18875864" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18875864" title="Empègue">
Empègue

Empègues are small images stencilled on doorways in southern France. The empègue symbolises that the household has contributed to groups of youths gathering funds for celebrations each August.
The drawings are made by the youths of a village and are said to date from the early part of the twentieth century when the local male youths would be conscripted into the military. Conscription is no longer practised in France but the tradition continues. The images are of traditional subjects which symbolise the local area. In the Petite Camargue the images frequently involve horses, flamingoes and of course bulls, because of the local version of bull fighting "(Course camarguaise)". In the version of bull fighting licensed in France the bull is merely decorated with prizes which youths attempt to steal from the long horned bull. The bull gets to fight another day.
Etymology.
The word is said to have derived from a word in Occitan, empeguar, which means ""stick"". In Spanish the meaning is to mark with pitch. Another suggestion is that it comes from Pegare - the word for paste. The original Empègues were made from a mixture of soot and paste.
Detail.
The images frequently include the abbreviation V.L.J. which stands for "Vive La Jeunesse" and the year of creation. In this way it is possible to date the development of the designs over many years. The samples included here date back over 40 years to 1964 (when conscription was still practised). Many of these images are from the village of Beauvoisin, but they could have come from any of the villages in Southern France where many of the smallest villages will have their own arena for bull fighting.
Groups are formed which fund raise for the season of celebrations of youth called the aubade in August. Groups will form to support their teams, to gather funds and to place their empègues around their area and at their base.
The purpose of the images is to record which houses have contributed to the funds for the festival. This is why the images vary from year to year and why the design is important. The Empègue is the "brand" of the group that collected money from you.

Soudley Ponds

Lying close to the village of Soudley in the Forest of Dean, west Gloucestershire, Soudley Ponds (), also known as Sutton Ponds, comprise four linked man-made ponds lined in succession through the narrow Sutton Valley, and surrounded by stands of tall Douglas Fir. It is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1984.
The site is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).
History.
The ponds were formerly believed to have been dug in the 18th century to provide water to the furnaces in the Soudley Valley and at the nearby Camp Mill. In fact these would have been fed from the Soudley Brook, and from the Tilting Mill Pool, now in the grounds of the Dean Heritage Centre. It has also been erroneously claimed that they were dug long before this as fish ponds by the monks of the nearby Flaxley Abbey.
However, Atkinson’s map of 1847 shows only a stream running through the valley where the ponds now lie, and it is nowadays assumed that were created as fish ponds after the land’s 1836 purchase by mine-owner William Crawshay. In 1899 the ponds, along with the rest of the Abbotswood Estate, were sold by Robert Crawshay, William’s son, to the Crown, from which point they were leased for fishing to private individuals. It was only in 1906 that the ponds became as they are today, following the work of Arthur Morgan, who had that year acquired the lease of the ponds, and after whom the lowest of the ponds is still locally known as Morgan’s Pool.
Ownership and usage.
Now in the care of the Forestry Commission, and declared an SSSI by Natural England, the ponds are one of the Forest of Dean’s most delightful spots, particularly in Spring and in Autumn, and are still used by the anglers of the Soudley Fishing Consortium for the purpose for which they were made.

Jason Roy

Jason Jonathan Roy (born 21 July 1990) is an English cricketer who currently plays for Surrey. He is a right-handed upper order batsman and amongst Surrey's most promising young players.
Early career.
Having moved to England along with his family when he was 10 years old, Roy was educated at Whitgift School and represented Surrey in age group cricket from U-11 through to Under-19 and Surrey Academy level. He took part in the Surrey Under-19 tour to South Africa in 2007, where he notably top-scored for Surrey with an innings of 51 in a one-day match against Western Province Under-19s.
He was a member of the 2007 intake of players to the Pemberton Greenish Surrey Academy, and on 15 June 2007 made a decisive contribution on his one-day debut for the Surrey second team, scoring 48 from 33 balls in a Second XI Trophy match against Hampshire which Surrey won by 3 runs.
Roy made no further appearances for the Surrey second team in 2007, but was selected to represent the South at Under-17 level in the ECB Regional Festival, held at Loughborough in July 2007, where he played in three matches.
In the 2008 season, Roy established himself in the Surrey second team. In his debut in the Second XI Championship, Roy scored 88 from 89 balls against a Hampshire attack which included the South African Test match bowler Nantie Hayward, having come to the crease with Surrey in trouble at 89-4. 
He made his debut for the Surrey first team in a Twenty20 Cup match against Middlesex on 27 June 2008, and made his List A debut in the Natwest Pro40 League fixture against Yorkshire on 20 July 2008, the day before his 18th birthday. 
He was used as a substitute fielder for England's test team against South Africa in the final test of the 2008 series at The Oval.
In September 2008, Roy was selected for the ECB Elite Player Development squad taking part in a triangular tournament against University Sport South Africa and MCC Universities. Roy was selected for two of his team's four matches. In his first match, against University Sport South Africa, Roy batted at number four but was only able to score a single run. His second match was disrupted by the weather and was declared a no result in the thirteenth over of MCC Universities' innings, which was being bowled by Roy.
In 2008, Roy won the Easter Scholarship to spend the 2008/2009 winter at the Darren Lehmann Academy in Adelaide. While in Australia, Roy also played club cricket for Port Adelaide Cricket Club, and was part of the team which won the XXXX Gold Grade 20/20 Competition, scoring 20 runs from 12 balls in the final played at the Adelaide Oval. This was the club's first victory in the competition.
In April 2009, Roy played in a pre-season match for Surrey against Leeds/Bradford UCCE. Batting at number five, Roy was dismissed for a duck in Surrey's first innings, but fared better with the ball, taking 2 wickets for 51 runs from five overs.
In spite of his promising performances for the Surrey second team the previous year, Roy was unable to win a place in the team at the beginning of the 2009 season. However, on 25 April 2009, he reminded the county selectors of his ability while playing for his club, Reigate Priory, in a 50-over per side match against the Surrey Second XI. He took a catch as Surrey were dismissed for 157, and opened the innings for Reigate Priory, scoring 69 runs from only 51 balls against a bowling attack including former England international James Ormond before being caught behind. This innings was instrumental in Reigate Priory reaching their target of 158 with more than 22 overs to spare. On 23 May 2009, Roy scored 115 off 88 balls in Reigate Priory's victory over Spencer in the Surrey Championship Premier Division.
Selected for Surrey to play against Warwickshire in the Under-19s County Championship at Whitgift School on 6 July 2009, Roy scored 129 from 106 balls in a drawn match. Following this impressive performance, Roy made his first appearance of the season in Surrey Second XI's match against Somerset at Millfield School on 14 July, scoring 20 in Surrey's first innings. Roy retained his place in the team for the friendly match against Yorkshire Second XI in Guildford on 11 August. Roy top-scored in Surrey's second innings with 45, although Yorkshire won by an innings with a day to spare.
Roy's next appearance for Surrey Second XI was on 18 August against MCC Universities in the Second XI Championship. Playing on familiar territory at Whitgift School, Roy scored 118 from 115 balls in a drawn match. On his return to the one-day team against Kent on 24 August, Roy top scored in Surrey's innings with 55. However, this promising run of form was abruptly ended in the Second XI Championship match against the same opponents which began the following day. Roy recorded a pair, although he took a catch in Kent's second innings.
Better performances for his club (including an aggressive 138 from 60 balls against Henley) and the county Second XI in September 2009 led to a recall to the Surrey first team for the NatWest Pro40 League fixture against Leicestershire on 27 September 2009. Roy opened Surrey's innings but scored only 6 runs. However, Surrey won the match by four wickets. This was to be Roy's first and only competitive match for the Surrey first team during the 2009 season.
Breakout year.
Roy began the 2010 season as a regular in the Surrey Second XI in both Championship (three-day) and Trophy (one-day) cricket. After an unremarkable start to the season, Roy made his first significant contributions to the team in May, scoring centuries in three successive Championship matches, against Essex, Sussex and Durham respectively. While he scored a greater number of runs against Essex (180) and Durham (120), the innings against Sussex was perhaps the most impressive. In Surrey's second innings, Roy batted at number five and came to the crease with the score 42-3 against a bowling attack containing internationals Yasir Arafat and James Kirtley. When Roy was dismissed for 104, the score was 260-5, setting the platform for Surrey's victory. Roy's century was the top score in Surrey's second innings.
Roy maintained his form with a century for Reigate Priory, but as the county schedule turned to a long period without Championship matches, he had no opportunity to continue the run. However, he had caught the attention of Surrey's Cricket Manager, Chris Adams, and was included in Surrey's senior team for the 2010 Friends Provident t20 tournament, making his first appearance against Hampshire on 22 June, scoring 12 runs at a strike rate of 109.09.
The following day, Roy made history by scoring an unbeaten century against Kent (101 from only 57 balls), the first century scored by a Surrey batsman in Twenty20 cricket, as Surrey won the game by 38 runs.
Roy earned further plaudits with another aggressive innings against Somerset on 2 July, scoring 74 from 50 balls in another Surrey victory. 
Surrey did not progress beyond the group stages of the 2010 Friends Provident t20, and Roy's personal performances also dipped towards the end of that competition. However, he continued to score heavily for the Second XI and appeared for the Surrey first team in the Clydesdale Bank 40 competition between July and September, the highlight being an innings of 60 from 49 balls against Sussex in a tied match on 4 September. During the match, Roy enjoyed a partnership of 105 runs in 17 overs alongside Surrey's new signing, England international Kevin Pietersen.
He made his first class debut on 24 August 2010 against Leicestershire at Grace Road, and was last man out in Surrey's first innings, scoring 76 runs off 65 balls (including 9 fours and 3 sixes) in Surrey's first innings total of 483. The last four wickets fell for only 7 runs, preventing Roy from scoring a century in his maiden first class innings. In his second first-class match, Roy scored 69 against Glamorgan on 7 September 2010 and retained his place in the team for Surrey's final County Championship match of the season against Gloucestershire. By the end of the 2010 season, Roy was established as a first team regular in all forms of cricket, and signed a two-year contract with Surrey, which he described as "a dream come true".
2011 season.
Although he ended the 2010 season as a first team regular and demonstrated his fitness in prior to the 2011 season (coming top in the Surrey squad's pre-season Bleep Test), Roy was only selected for one pre-season match in the first team, scoring 0 and 4 against Middlesex. Surrey had strengthened their batting resources over the preceding winter, confirming the long term signing of Kevin Pietersen, as well as bringing in new batsmen Zander de Bruyn and Tom Maynard, and Roy began the season in the Second XI.
However, Roy was included in the first team for the Clydesdale Bank 40 competition and made an immediate impression, scoring 60 runs in his first match, against Scotland, and 76 against Hampshire. Roy scored another half century in the return fixture against Scotland. He made his first County Championship appearance of the season on 4 May against Leicestershire, and although he was dismissed for 5 in the first innings, he scored an aggressive 76 in the second innings as Surrey set the platform for victory. This innings equalled his highest first-class score at the time.
Roy was rested for the Championship match against Essex on 18 May as Surrey included their centrally-contracted international players, Kevin Pietersen and Chris Tremlett, but in the following match, against Glamorgan on 24 May, Roy returned to the first team. After an inauspicious first innings in which he scored only three runs, Roy took his maiden first-class wickets in Glamorgan's second innings, returning bowling figures of 2/29. He then opened Surrey's second innings and scored his maiden first-class century (an unbeaten 106 from 109 balls), guiding Surrey to a comfortable draw. He brought up his hundred with a six struck into the pavilion.
On 17 August he scored his first 40 over century, making 101 off 95 balls against Warwickshire at Edgbaston. He followed this up 4 days later with 131 off 99 balls, helping Surrey defeat Leicestershire at Grace Road.
Roy's season ended in fine style, being part of the Surrey side who won the CB40 final at Lord's against Somerset. Although Roy's day wasn't a personal success - being dismissed for a typically aggressive 11 immediately before a rain delay - he could at least be content that, as the second highest run scorer in the competition he had played a significant part in Surrey's progress to that stage.
On 29 September 2011, Roy was named by the ECB in the England Performance Programme Squad for 2011-12.
Personal life.
Roy took A-level examinations in Sports Science and Business in 2008, and was offered a place at St. Mary's University College. However, Roy turned down the opportunity to continue his studies in order to concentrate on cricket.

One day after the years go by, a documentary film maker Bob Armstrong, his daughter Beth, and his pilot Brownie McGee stumble upon Yowler. Eager for fame and money, Bob convinces John to "rent" Yowler to local corrupt businessman, Lester McIntyre. John, who is coerced in part by the offer to have the mounting taxes on the castle paid off, allows Lester to take Yowler in. He does so also partly because of his growing interest in Beth.

Venetian Theatre

The Venetian Theatre is a movie theater, performing arts venue, and restaurant in downtown Hillsboro, Oregon, United States. Formerly the Town Theater, the building re-opened in 2008 after more than a decade of inactivity and revitalization plans. Built in 1888 as a bank, later mayor Orange Phelps converted the property into a theater in 1911 and in 1925 converted it into a two-story Italianate building with a larger auditorium. Prior to renovation the theater was owned by the city of Hillsboro who purchased it from Act III Theaters.
History.
In 1888, banker John W. Shute built a two-story building on East Main Street as the new home for the First National Bank of Hillsboro. The structure featured a façade in the Italianate style of architecture, external cast iron ornamentation, and a roof line with a bracketed cornice. In 1911, the bank moved across Main Street and later mayor Orange Phelps purchased the building. Although Phelps did not have the money to buy the building, the bank loaned him the funds and he opened The Grand Theater, a 200-seat theater. The wide by long theater was expanded in 1915 to 500 seats and named the Liberty Theater.
In 1925, a fire destroyed the theater and Phelps rebuilt the structure and named the new theater The Venetian. The first motion picture with sound shown in Hillsboro was "The Broadway Melody" in 1929 at the theater. Beginning in 1935 Phelps held an annual free show for children at Christmas which continued into the 1990s. In 1956, a fire gutted the building, with Phelps rebuilding and opening the following year as the 800-plus seat Town Theater. After the fire Phelps had held double features at his Town Theater. The theater hosted the premier of the film "Ring of Fire" in 1961 after the film was shot in Vernonia, Oregon. Phelps owned the theater along with several other theaters in Washington County into the 1970s. Tom Moyer Theaters purchased Phelps’ theaters in 1978 and in turn sold all of that theater chain’s screens to Act III Theaters (later merged into Regal Entertainment Group) in 1989. In 1996, Act III closed the theater and sold the building to the city for $1,500.
After purchasing the property the city proposed several redevelopment ideas for the building, including selling it to the McMenamins brewpub chain for a theater and pub. In 2001, Hillsboro purchased the adjoining building (home to Music Village at the time) for $160,000 to add to the property to be used for any redevelopment of the theater. The city solicited ideas for the redevelopment of the building in early 2007. While under city ownership the space was briefly used as storage for the Hillsboro Farmers’ Market and faced possible demolition as estimates for the cost to renovate the structure continually increased.
In August 2007, the city sold the building to developer Denzil Scheller for $10 and gave him $750,000 to assist in the renovation of the deteriorating building. Scheller spent $2.5 million to renovate the space and bring the building up to modern fire, earthquake, and disability access codes. Of this $2.5 million, around $1.5 million came from his own funds, and the remainder came from city funds along with $250,000 from Metro in the conversion of the space into a theater, meeting space, restaurant, and live event venue. Work included gutting the building to rebuild the support structure, removing asbestos, and opening a wall into the adjacent Music Village building. Local architectural firm Partin and Hill Architects designed the renovations.
Scheller renamed the theater as The Venetian, returning to the former name, with the distinct yellow marquee of the Town Theater removed in September 2007. The re-opening of the theater is part of the city’s plan to create a regional arts center in the downtown core and attract more people after 5:00 p.m. when county and city offices close. On July 9, 2008, the new The Venetian Theatre and Bistro opened with the theater portion opening on July 11. In September 2008, Bag & Baggage Productions became the resident theater company at the theater and opened their new season with "Steel Magnolias". In October 2010, the renovation of the theater was awarded the Outstanding Achievement in Design award from the Oregon Main Street organization.
Details.
Located in downtown Hillsboro on Main Street between Second and Third avenues, the theater is one block north of the Hillsboro Central MAX light rail station. The space includes a 370-seat theater, and a restaurant with an upstairs balcony. The balcony sits above Main Street and has roll-up windows. On the exterior are decorative terra cotta urns and red colored roof tiles on Main Street. Designed to encourage late night patronage of the downtown area, the theater is a centerpiece of revitalization efforts of that part of Hillsboro.
The current building is a multi-use facility that includes a theater and restaurant. The theater exhibits movies, presents live performances, is a live music venue, and can be used as meeting space. The casual dining restaurant features a European menu with items including pizza, soup, sandwiches, and hamburgers, all of which can be eaten in the theater.

Willowfield F.C.

Willowfield is a defunct intermediate football club which existed in Northern Ireland during the inter-war years. 
In the 1927/28 season, it became the second(First being Belfast Celtic) team from outside the Irish League to win the Irish Cup since the League's formation in 1890. They defeated Larne 1-0 in the final at Windsor Park. Willowfield had previously reached the Irish Cup final in 1923/24, when they lost to Queen's Island.
The club played at the Willowfield Recreation Grounds(now Gibson Park Avenue), which is now the home of Malone Rugby Club, who acquired it in 1935. It is likely that Willowfield FC folded shortly before this.

Caucasus Frontier 2008

Caucasus Frontier 2008 were military exercises conducted by Russia starting July 5, 2008. The active phase was during the second week of July.
They were held in several regions of the Southern Federal District, including Chechnya, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, and Karachay–Cherkessia.
The units involved were from the North Caucasus Military District, mainly the 58th Army, the 4th Air Force Army, Interior Ministry troops, and border guards. Some 8,000 military personnel, 700 combat vehicles and 30 aircraft were involved.
The stated goals included practicing assistance to Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, drawing protests from the Georgian Foreign Ministry.
The exercises were held less than a month before the 2008 South Ossetia war, and were almost concurrent to joint US-Georgian exercises dubbed Immediate Response 2008.

USS Hewell (AG-145)

USS "Hewell" (AG-145/AKL-14) was a "Camano"-class cargo ship constructed for the U.S. Army as FS-391 shortly before the end of World War II. FS-391 operated with a U.S. Coast Guard crew in the Southwest Pacific area. The ship was acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1948. She was configured as a transport and cargo ship and served with the U.S. Pacific Fleet – including highly-decorated service during the Korean War – until decommissioned in 1955.
U.S. Army.
"FS-391", a Design 381 (Vessel, Supply, Diesel, Steel, 177') U.S. Army Freight and Supply vessel, was launched in 1944 by United States Concrete Pipe Corp. of Los Angeles, California and commissioned at Los Angeles on 28 July 1944 with LTJG Ted C. Larsen, USCGR, assuming command, relieving Lt Thomas A. Buddy, USCGR. He was succeeded by LTJG Henry P. Mistrey, USCGR, who in turn was succeeded on 10 October 1945, by LTJG George W. Litchfield, USCGR. She was assigned to and operated in the Southwest Pacific area.
U.S. Navy.
"FS-391" was acquired by the Navy on 2 February 1948, modified for Naval service and classified as a miscellaneous auxiliary, commissioned as USS "Hewell" (AG-145) at Pearl Harbor on 5 June 1948, Lt. (j.g.) John W. Hinkleman in command.
"Hewell's" shakedown cruise initially took her across the central Pacific Ocean to Midway Islands, Guam and Saipan. Attached to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, Hewell carried supplies between Navy bases throughout the central Pacific.
Redesignated a light cargo ship or "AKL-14" in June 1949 she continued her duties of transporting cargo among the Pacific Islands, including the Caroline Islands and the Marshall Islands.
Korean War operations.
After the North Korean communist attack on South Korea in June 1950 "Hewell" shifted her base of operations to Japan in July, from there shuttling supplies and ammunition between Japan, Okinawa and Guam to Korea. The light cargo ship returned to her normal inter-island cargo carrying routine in October, remaining on that duty until August 1951 when she sailed to Pearl Harbor for overhaul.
From November 1951 to March 1953, "Hewell" transported supplies and ammunition on the shuttle route from Japan and Korea, conducting an unglamorous but vital role in helping to keep UN forces in "beans and bullets." After another overhaul at Yokosuka Japan from 10 April thru 9 June 1953 the light cargo ship resumed supply runs from Japan for the troops in Korea. On 31 July 1953 the ship picked up 200 South Korean Marines in Wonsan for transport to South KoreaThe end of hostilities in August 1953 did not end her supply missions and "Hewell" remained on that duty through mid-1954. In June of that year, she made a cruise through the central Pacific island bases before arriving at Pearl Harbor in July.
Filming "Mister Roberts".
In late August 1954 "Hewell" departed Hawaii for Midway Island, mooring at the Naval Base there on 28 August to help film the Warner Brothers movie "Mister Roberts". The film, starring Henry Fonda, James Cagney, William Powell and Jack Lemmon, was partially shot on board "Hewell", with underway footage filmed off Midway harbor between 1–16 September. The light cargo ship then sailed back to Hawaii between 24–29 September and additional film was shot off Kaneohe Bay between 30 September and 7 October.
Small alterations were made to the ship and a stage set built to create the "palm tree deck" and access to it. The crew in the movie is seen going below into what is actually an FS/AKL hold. Each crewmember received a check for $200 and a lighter with "Hewell" and "Mr. Roberts" engraved for their appearance.
Occasional claims are made that another ship was the exterior film set for the movie; however, evidence, including the Navy's official "Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships" (DANFS), make clear that "Hewell" was the ship.
Inactivation and sale.
Shortly thereafter, "Hewell" sailed east to Astoria, Oregon, remaining there until she decommissioned 15 March 1955 and joined the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. "Hewell" remained there until 1 November 1959 when she was stricken from the Navy List and sold to Steve Pickard on 2 June 1960. The ship was scrapped at Lake Union, Seattle, Washington c. 1973.
Honors and awards.
"Hewell" received seven battle stars for Korean service:

Ernst Lecher

Ernst Lecher (1856–1926) was an Austrian physicist who, from 1909, was head of the "First Institute of Physics" in Vienna. He is remembered for developing an apparatus— "Lecher lines"—to measure the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic waves. He gave his name to the Ernst-Lecher-Institut, a radar research establishment set up in the 1940s in Reichenau, south of Vienna, which is now a part of the German research institute Max Planck Institute.
Lecher's father, Zacharias K Lecher, was editor of Vienna's leading daily newspaper, "Die Presse", and helped to publicise the discovery of X-rays of his German colleague Wilhelm Röntgen in 1896. Lecher's nephew, Konrad Zacharias Lorenz, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973.

Hugo Obermaier

Hugo Obermaier (born 29 January 1877, Regensburg; d. 12 November 1946, Fribourg, Switzerland) was a distinguished prehistorian and anthropologist who taught at various European centres of learning. He is particularly associated with his work on the diffusion of mankind in Europe during the Ice Age, and in connection with north Spanish cave art, and resisted placing his science at the disposal of nationalistic and racialist interests in the Germany of the 1930s.
Career.
Hugo Obermaier spent his childhood and the early part of his student years in Regensburg. In 1900 he was ordained as a lay priest and between 1901 and 1904 he studied in Vienna the subjects of Prehistoric archaeology, physical geography, geology, palaeontology, ethnology, German philology and human anatomy. Among his teachers at this time the most important were Albrecht Penck, Josef Szombathy and Moritz Hoernes. In 1904 he gained a doctorate with a dissertation on "The Diffusion of Humankind during the Ice Age in Middle Europe". Only four years later he qualified as a lecturer and in 1909, despite opposition from Albrecht Penck, his former teacher, he became an unsalaried university lecturer in Vienna. In 1911 he took up a professorial post at the newly founded Institute of Human Palaeontology in Paris, which he held until the outbreak of the First World War. In that period he was working with Wernert and Henri Breuil at the caves of El Castillo and the Cueva de La Pasiega in Cantabria. While in Spain (1914) he next decided to work at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid, but changing again in 1922 to a professorship at the Complutense University in Madrid. He dug at the Cave of Altamira in 1924-5, and collaborated with Breuil in their publication in 1935. His work with Frobenius included the study of the Neolithic rock engravings of south Oran in 1925.
Scientific, personal and (certainly) political considerations were the cause for his refusal to go back to Germany when, in 1933, he declined the invitation to take up the Max Ebert Chair in Berlin. After the outbreak of the civil war, in 1939 he left there to take up a Professorship in Fribourg in Switzerland. Hugo Obermaier died after a long illness in the Theological hostel in Fribourg.
Hugo Obermaier Society.
The scientific contributions of H. Obermaier lay primarily in research into the Old Stone Age, which he was one of the first to recognise as being a field for serious scientific research. In order to pay respect to his memory and equally to advance scientific investigations into the Palaeolithic, on 23 June 1951 archaeologists, geologists, palaeontologists and anthropologists formed a society led by Lothar Zotz. In 1956 the name "Hugo Obermaier Society for Research into the Ice Age and the Stone Age" was adopted.

Implied repo rate

Implied Repo Rate IRR is the rate of return of borrowing money to buy an asset in the spot market and delivering it in the futures market where the notional is used to repay the loan. (This definition of IRR should not be confused with internal rate of return.)
Simplified closed form.

where dayBase is 365 or 360
Usage.
Determine the Cheapest To Deliver asset.
To determine the cheapest bond in a basket of deliverable bonds against a futures contract, implied repo rate is computed for each bond; the bond with the highest repo rate is the cheapest. It is the cheapest because it has the lowest initial value to yield a higher return provided it is delivered with the stated futures price.
The net basis between a futures price and its underlying bonds may provide an indication of which bond is the cheapest. However, since the method, unlike the IRR method, neglects the actual running cost of bonds, it is less accurate as a measury for CTD ranking.

Ulster F.C.

Ulster Football Club is a defunct Irish association football club that was based in Ballynafeigh, Belfast. It was initially founded in 1877 as a rugby club, but later switched codes to association football. It was subsequently a founding member of the Irish Football League in 1890. The club later switched back to rugby and continued playing into the 1930s.
The club was founded by members of Ulster Cricket Club and played its home games at the Ulster Cricket Ground. It is listed as a rugby club in Richard M. Peter’s "Irish Football Annual 1880" and during the 1879-80 season it played 24 games, taking on, among others, local rivals North of Ireland and Queen's College, Belfast. On October 24, 1878 the club hosted a demonstration game between two Scottish association football teams, Queen's Park and Caledonian. This game is recognised as one of the earliest organised association football games to be played in Ireland. A second demonstration game in 1879 saw an Ulster XI take on another Scottish club side, Lenzie. During the 1880s and early 1890s, both Ulster and its home ground played a prominent role in the early history of association football in Ireland. Ulster reached the Irish Cup final on three occasions, winning the competition in 1887 after defeating Cliftonville 3-0 in the final. They were also founder members of the Irish Football League and finished as runners-up during its first two seasons, 1890-91 and 1891-92. The club was a member of the League for six seasons in total: four between 1890 and 1894 and two from 1901 to 1903. During the 1880s, Ballynafeigh also hosted several Irish Cup finals and Ireland international games.

Saltoun Parish Church

Saltoun Parish Church is a church in East Saltoun, East Lothian, Scotland. It is part of the Church of Scotland, and (along with Bolton Parish Church) serves the parish of Bolton and Saltoun, which includes the villages of Bolton, East Saltoun and West Saltoun.
The church lies in the centre of the village.
History.
The first church in Saltoun Parish was built in 1244 by the Bishop of St Andrews, and was dedicated to Saint Michael. During the brief establishment of Episcopacy in Scotland in 1633, the church (and the control of electing a minister) was transferred to the Bishop of Edinburgh, before being passed to Andrew Fletcher (the local land-owner) in 1643. 
Gilbert Burnet (later the Bishop of Salisbury) started his ministry at Saltoun in 1665. During his five years there, he enlarged the church. He left in 1669 to become Professor of Divinity at Glasgow University and, later, Bishop of Salisbury. 
The present church building was built in 1805, probably by the architect Robert Burn. The church is crucifrom in shape, with the vestry and steeple occupying the eastern arm.
In 1929 the parishes of Bolton and Saltoun were united, and in 1970 the parish was linked (but not united) with Humbie to the south and Yester (Gifford) to the east.

Beet was born in Birmingham, England. He started playing the guitar at the age of fourteen and soon fell in love with the sound and dynamics of an acoustic guitar, on which all of his songs are written. His roots are in ska and rocksteady, which are reflected in his songs - they are a blend of ska/reggae and rocksteady/a cool soul feel sound mixed with urban folk. Beet is a singer, songwriter and soprano saxophone player, which is what he was playing when he met Saxa in 1984. 
He currently plays with The Acoustic Theatre playing ska and rocksteady songs with acoustic instruments.

Congregation of the Holy Family of Nazareth

The Congregation of the Holy Family of Nazareth (Latin: "Congregatio Sacrae Familiae a Nazareth"; Italian: "Congregazione della Sacra Famiglia di Nazareth") is a Catholic male religious institute. Members of this clerical congregation, known popularly as "Piamartini", add the abbreviation “F.N.” after their names.
History.
The institute was founded by Italian priest Saint Giovanni Battista Piamarta, parish priest to Brescia. He was always sensitive to the problems of young people of the working class and opened agricultural and craft schools for them. 
In 1900 this gave birth to a new congregation of priests who devote themselves to the care of children of the people, especially those without families, caring and professional education. The Holy See approved the establishment by Decree of January 10, 1948.
Activities and dissemination.
The Piamartini are a community of priests consecrated to God, as well as laity who are dedicated to training young people to Christian life through socialization and work. Their motto is "Pietas et Labor" (Piety and Labor). 
The Congregation is present in Italy, Brazil, Angola and Chile. As of December 31, 2005, the congregation had 23 houses and 137 religious, 93 of them priests.
Other foundations.
Over the years the congregation has added others that support the activities of the Piamartini:

Torre di Moravola

The Torre di Moravola is a 10th-century medieval watch tower built in Umbria, central Italy, to guard the southern approaches of Montone by the Fortebraccio, a condottieri family of the Renaissance. Positioned on a hill top ridge, Madonna di Confine, overlooking the Carpini valley 450 metres above sea level, this strategic site served the dual purposes of holding the high ground and allowing the knights stationed there views of approach routes.
On observing an approaching enemy the knights would signal Montone via line of sight. The warning time was sufficient to allow the citizens of Montone to retreat to defensive positions.
Architecture.
Ancillary structures clustered around the central tower housed the garrison's knights and horses. Over the centuries the architecture has reflected the use of the site. Originally a place of worship in the 8th century, additional structures were added for defensive military purposes in the 10th and 12th centuries. Eventually the site was used as a farm with most of the structures falling into disrepair.
In 1999 the site was purchased by architect Christopher Chong and designer Seonaid Mackenzie who embarked into what ultimately became a nine-year renovation program. Chong had worked on larger projects for James Stirling and Norman Foster, an example of which includes the shopping areas of Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok, Hong Kong. Local Italian construction codes required that new structures be confined to the footprints of existing structures and that basic historical attributes be maintained. The original floors and plans of the main tower had long since been lost through the mists of time, giving the design team a free hand to build, so long as the external building's exterior shell was preserved.
The architectural methodology includes a green approach that neatly integrates with acoustic goals for the property, a spa retreat hotel. A significant proportion of a building's carbon footprint comes from (a) the manufacture of building materials and (b) the heating and cooling of a building's interior envelope. Reusing the buildings outer shell and foundations reduces the need for new building materials. Heating and cooling is achieved without the need for air conditioning and its associated acoustic noise intrusion. In the summer, the most popular time for visitors, the tower is cooled naturally by three thermodynamic features. The seven tower suites are built around a central staircase tower core, whose height gives rise to natural convection currents that draws cool air from lower levels and exhausts hot air at the rooftop. Secondly, the thermal mass of the 12th-century tower stone exterior provides a thermodynamic reservoir, absorbing energy during the day, and releasing that energy during the cooler nights. Finally the location of the tower on a hill top ridge allows it to escape the higher temperatures of the valley below.
The swimming pool is located on a higher elevation, south of the main tower building (see section and plan). The pool walls are painted the unusual color black, to enhance the optical properties of the pool's infinity edge. The tower, when viewed from the south poolside pavilion, is seen to be rising as if from a castle moat. Solar evacuated tube collectors are used to provide pool and building heating efficiently, due to the near optimal thermal load matching of solar energy in low temperature difference applications.
Local building materials were used where ever possible, in particular Pietra Serena, a blue grey stone from a local quarry. This stone is the same as used on the floors of Apple stores worldwide. The use of local stone, stone being a relatively heavy building material, has a significant reduction on trucking costs and environmental impact. One of the more novel uses of Pietra Serena is for the sinks and baths. In order to achieve the high precision required CNC machine tools were used to custom cut and shape solid stone blocks. The use of stone floors also allows for the use of a hydronic underfloor heating system, with the advantages of silent operation and good efficiency, because of the emissivity and absorpivity of stone.
Interior stairs in the duplex suites make use of materials originally engineered for exterior applications. The custom designed stairs are constructed of COR-TEN B steel (ASTM A 588), giving them a durable rustic appearance. The rustic theme is also mirrored in the wood grain patterns imprinted in the concrete walls. All concrete structures are constructed using concrete forms, usually these forms are made of steel. The resulting finish of steel shuttered concrete can be extremely precise, an example of which is Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. The cost is however high, because each steel form needs to be custom made, and then positioned accurately. Moravola's walls used wooden forms, which in addition to the cost savings, allowed easy fabrication within the existing historical 10th-century structure.
The Tower interiors have been restored with a modernistic design approach that complement auxiliary buildings, terraces and pool areas to create a contemporary retreat. The structures are aligned on an axis with the Tower to maximize panoramic views over the Carpini valley, a view unchanged since medieval times, enchanting in its quiet beauty; an escape from the modern world.

Apa Sâmbetei

In Romanian mythology, Apa Sâmbetei (; lit. "saturday's water") is the name given to the World Ocean, the ocean that was said to encompass the entire earth. Its description varies by region, being described as boiling due to the proximity of hell (in Bucovina), or as cold, as the Kingdom of God is said to be built upon it.
It is said that the souls of the deceased follow the course of rivers into the "Apa Sâmbetei". The currents of this ocean encircle the earth three times before descending into hell for the purpose of transporting the souls to the afterlife. It is because of this belief that Romanians make the sign of the cross before drinking from a stream, in order to ensure that they do not "drink" one such soul.
Also in Bucovina, it is believed that a woman is unable to cross the "Apa Sâmbetei", but only men, especially the monks who were considered to live a pious life.
Contemporary use.
The Saturday's Water is often used in colloquial Romanian in the expression "s-a dus pe Apa Sâmbetei!" (it has gone on the Saturday's Water), meaning that something has gone wrong or been wasted.

Sinuca brasileira

Sinuca brasileira (Brazilian Portuguese for Brazilian snooker), often simply called sinuca, is a cue sport played on a snooker table, using only one instead of snooker's fifteen, with the normal six of the standard set of snooker balls. Each ball carries the same basic value as in snooker. As with other pocket billiards games, a white is used to the red and other coloured balls. The game is played almost exclusively in Brazil and is little known outside this region.
Rules.
Ball values are the same as in standard snooker (red = 1, yellow = 2, = 3, = 4, = 5, pink = 6, = 7) and points are awarded to a player after the corresponding ball is legally potted.
The colours are set up on their normal as in snooker, while the remaining red ball is placed halfway between the and the right side . The cue ball is placed in . The opening player may move the ball anywhere within the "D" before playing. After this, players will only have a chance to move the cue ball when an () occurs, and the incoming opponent will get , permitting placement of the cue ball anywhere within the "D". 
The first shot must be played so that the red ball is contacted; however, it is not permitted to either pocket the red ball or leave the opponent snookered.
Taken in turns, each player has a choice to either shoot for the ball with the lowest point value (a free shot); or, select any other ball (a penalty shot). 
On choosing a free shot a player must proceed with a continuation shot, and the free ball remains out of the game. Any ball may be nominated and selected as the ball 'on' for the continuation shot; which, after being pocketed, must be re-spotted. Missing either the free shot or the continuation shot ends the player's innings. However, if the player elects to shoot a penalty shot, the penalty ball is re-spotted and the next shot taken must be a free shot. In contrast to free or continuation shots, missing a penalty shot is not only the end of an innings but also a foul.
Every foul awards an opponent with 7 points. All other rules are the same as in snooker, although , and other combination shots are automatically illegal because all the balls are different colours.

Dave Huntley (born 1957 in Toronto, Ontario) is a former Canadian lacrosse player and head coach and general manager with the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League. Huntley played collegiate lacrosse at Johns Hopkins University where he helped his team win two national championships. In 1979, Huntley was honored with the McLaughlin Award, which is presented annually to the nation's most outstanding college lacrosse midfielder. His son, Kevin Huntley, was also an All-American at Johns Hopkins. Huntley was also the first ever head coach for the Toronto Nationals.
Playing career.
Huntley grew up in Ontario playing box lacrosse, an indoor version of the game which is played most commonly in Canada. Huntley was recruited to play field lacrosse for the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, playing from 1976 to 1979, and helping the team win two consecutive national championships, in 1978 and 1979. 
While playing with the Blue Jays he was named a three time All-American, was awarded as the nation's most outstanding midfielder in 1979 when he was presented with the McLaughlin Award, and played on three straight NCAA finals teams. He finished his college career as the leading goal scorer at Johns Hopkins among midfielders. Huntley also played internationally and was a member of Team Canada’s gold medal winning 1978 World Lacrosse Championship team. 
Huntley and his son Kevin Huntley, also a former All-American at John's Hopkins, are the only father–son duo to win two national championships, and are only the second pairing to score 100 or more goals each in their respective Division I lacrosse careers.
Coaching career.
Huntley's career in professional lacrosse began in the inaugural season of the "Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League" (a predecessor of the National Lacrosse League) in 1987 when he served as the Philadelphia Wings general manager and coach. As general manager, he recruited lacrosse stars Mike French, John Tucker, and John Grant, Sr. to play for his team. During the season, due to team injuries, Huntley stepped down from his coaching position and joined the team as a player. In two games, Huntley scored three goals. In subsequent seasons, Huntley worked in various capacities for the Baltimore Thunder, Pittsburgh Crossefire, Washington Power and Colorado Mammoth. 
Huntley has been an assistant coach, at times, for Loyola College in Maryland, the Baltimore Bayhawks of Major League Lacrosse, and four times for Team Canada in World Lacrosse Championship competitions.

<doc id="18876566" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18876566" title="Ravnica">
Ravnica

Ravnica is a "" block that consists of three expert-level expansion sets: Ravnica: City of Guilds (October 7, 2005), Guildpact (February 3, 2006), and Dissension (May 5, 2006). Following in the tradition of other "Magic" blocks, "Ravnica" takes place in a of the multiverse that was previously unexplored in the game's backstory. The world of Ravnica is an ecumenopolis, a vast city that covers the entire surface of its planet, and is home to a diverse assortment of sentient races. Much power in Ravnica is held by the ten "guilds", political factions that each represent a combination of two of . The mythology of "Ravnica" is loosely derived from Slavic folklore. This plane was revisited in the Return to Ravnica block.
Design.
"Ravnica" was conceived following the success of "". "Invasion", released in 2000, emphasized interactions between the colors, and it was one of Magic's most popular releases ever. Magic's lead designer, Mark Rosewater, wanted to expand on the multicolor theme in a new way. Therefore, the design of "Ravnica" is based around ten two-color pairs, including cards in which those pairs of colors work in concert.
The Ravnica block is "functionally" different from Invasion block due to the interaction of the multi-colored theme. In the Invasion block, for example, the first two sets ("Invasion" and ') centered around friendly colors and the harmony they create when put together. The last set, ', emphasized enemy colors and areas where the colors contrast and possibly create powerful effects. However, the Ravnica block features a limited number of color combinations (some friendly, some enemy) in every set based on what guilds are present. All the multicolor cards in Ravnica block (and many other cards) are associated with one of the ten guilds.
Storyline.
Each of the guilds had been at war with each other for centuries, and the only thing that made the leaders agree to a truce was the fact that the dead had begun haunting the plane. They decided that each guild would specialize in two colors of magic and have specific jobs in the city to stretch the limited resources and maintain order, including by banning war completely.
The game and novels begin 9999 years after the Guildpact was formed, on the eve of the decimillennial celebrations. All three books were written by Cory J. Herndon and published by Wizards of the Coast.
Ravnica.
As the preparations for the celebrations are getting finished, tensions between the guilds have reached the breaking point. Things aren't helped any by the fact that, while many don't believe it exists anymore, the still very much alive House Dimir never agreed to the Guildpact. They, along with the Golgari Swarm, almost destroy the core of Selesnyan civilization. 
Agrus Kos (A Wojek officer in the Boros Legion), Jarad (Brother of the Devkarin leader Savra), Fonn Zurich (Daughter of a Wojek officer who joined the Selesnya Conclave after her dad's death), Feather (A Firemane angel who worked with Kos), Pivlic (An Orzhov businessman), and Savra (The leader of the Golgari Devkarin elves) are the main characters in the novel who each play their own role. They all come together eventually, and quite a bit of chaos ensues. Savra then tries to take over her guild and resurrect the necromancer Svothgir, and all the characters are thrown into a huge war.
The dark undercity's the domain of the Devkarin elves, and that's where Jarad and the rest run the city with necromancy and hunting skill; while the skies above are policed by Boros angels. They both stay to their own sections, so the Selesnya keep passageways clear with the Ledev, a group of paramilitary soldiers who defend the right of free travel. Fonn, an elite Ledev, guards her priest friend while he travels to the decimillenial celebrations, but an explosion tears through the city and kills him, flings Fonn into Jarad's arms, and causing a lot of trouble for Kos.
With a partner dead (although continuing to appear in the plot in the form of a ghost), Kos embarks on the investigation that takes him throughout the various settings of Ravnica. This involves conflict with some of the most powerful guilds of the plane, with no end in sight to the fighting. 
Guildpact.
Like its predecessor, "Ravnica: City of Guilds", "Guilpact" stars Agrus Kos and his business partner/friend Pivlic, as well as several new characters. With their new friend Teysa Karlov, Orzhov baroness of the diseased frontier zone named Utvara, the two begin to unravel an Izzet secret that delves deeper than any of them thought, all the while searching for the missing messenger of Zomaj Hauc, Izzet Guild upper manager and lead engineer of the Cauldron, a powerplant supplying energy to all of the Utvara region.
Crix the goblin finds herself in the hands of the indigenous peoples of Utvara while Baroness Teysa and her minions attempt to gain control of the region that has now become hers to own. But Crix finds that the plains around Utvara are mysterious, full of bizarre creatures that trace back to the ancient days of Ravnica, as well as a race of people who wear fungus on their backs to protect themselves from a spore that got thrown up into the air after the Izzet Guild attempted to “reclaim” the Utvaran region for the previous owner, Teysa’s uncle and prodigal father. But as Crix stays out in the spores, strange occurrences with the natives cause her to doubt the truths she holds dear.
Crix manages to manipulate the natives into helping her get to the Cauldron, partially to deliver the message she had been sent to deliver and partially to get to the bottom of this deadly mystery. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the courier, Agrus Kos and Pivlic have also become aware of the strange behaviors of the natives and begin an expedition to rescue the intrepid Izzet. However, as they work forward toward their goal, both the human and the imp find that it is not as easy of a task as it originally appeared, especially not when the Nephilim, the ancient creatures Crix encounters, become more rampant in this area of the frontier. Since kidnapping is a crime, Kos is propelled forward, but unfortunately for him, his path leads straight to the gates of the Cauldron.
Back in Utvara, things seem to be simple and reclaiming the once lost territory is becoming a task that Teysa Karlov has turned into a lucrative business venture. But while business continues to improve, Teysa begins to uncover a mystery that's plagued her for her entire life. All the issues that go along with it are getting to be too much for someone like her who's getting up in her years. It all culminates in the first Baroness of the Orzhov meeting her enemies face to face.
Guilds.
Of the ten guilds that rule Ravnica, four are the focus of this first set in the block. The next expansion, "Guildpact", focused only on three other guilds, and the last set in the block, "Dissension", introduced the last three guilds. Each guild corresponds to a different two-color combination. The guilds featured in the Ravnica block are:
Each guild has the following cards:
The appearance of a guild symbol in the background of a card's text box identifies that card's guild affiliation. For example, the symbol of the green-white Selesnya guild appears on green-white cards, cards with the convoke mechanic, lands that produce green and white mana, and so on. The guild symbols have no effect on game play.
Other cycles include the Leylines (one for each color) and the Nephilim (one for each four-color combinations).
Mechanics.
Ravnica introduces hybrid mana. Each symbol is a circle halved diagonally, in which the top left half is one color and the bottom right half another. A smaller version of the color's icon (sun for white, skull for black, etc.) appears in the corresponding half. These mana symbols mean that mana of either color may be used to pay it; for example, a spell whose mana cost is two green/white hybrid mana may be played using two green mana, two white mana, or one green and one white. The cards with these mana symbols have a colored border that fades from left to right, out of one color and into the other; and are counted as both colors.
Each of the ten guilds has a new keyword or ability word associated with it.
Ravnica block includes many mono-color cards which encourage people to play with multiple colors. "Ravnica: City of Guilds" featured cards which have activated abilities that use mana of different color from the cards' color. "Guildpact" introduced cards which are enhanced if another mana color is used to play the card. In "Dissension", in addition to the first 'group' of abilities, another group of mono-color cards have abilities associated with two colors, but must be played with mana of a different color or else the card must be sacrificed. An example is . It is a white creature with a life gain effect (white's specialty), as well as unblockability (blue's specialty). However, if Azorius Herald is played without blue mana, it must be sacrificed just after it comes into play.
Dissension features the return of the popular split card mechanic originally from ' and '. There are 10 gold split cards representing some combinations of the other guilds of Ravnica. The allied color guilds are represented in uncommon split cards, whereas the enemy color guilds are represented in rare split cards.
Notable cards.
Notable cards of "Ravnica: City of Guilds" include, ' and
"Guildpact" also includes Magic's first and (so far) only creatures with exactly four colors, the Nephilim.
Reception.

Kevin Huntley (lacrosse)

Kevin Huntley (born September 20, 1986) is a professional lacrosse player with the Toronto Nationals of Major League Lacrosse and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League. He plays the attack position. Huntley played collegiate lacrosse at Johns Hopkins University where he helped his team win two national championships, and finished his college career as the eighth all-time leading goal scorer in Johns Hopkins history. His father, Dave Huntley, was also an All-American at Johns Hopkins. In 2008, Huntley was named Major League Lacrosse Rookie of the Year.
Collegiate career.
Huntley won two national championships while playing with the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays. As a freshman he played in fifteen games and helped the Blue Jays win the 2005 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. He led his team in goals during the tournament. In 2006, as a sophomore, Huntley was awarded USILA third team All-American honors. In his junior season he helped his team win the 2007 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. In the Blue Jays' quarterfinal game against Georgetown University, Huntley scored a career high five goals. Earlier in the contest, Huntley was penalized for using an illegal stick. When he returned to play he was using a teammate's stick when he scored all five goals. As a senior, Huntley and the Blue Jays were again in the national championship game; however, this time they were defeated by the Syracuse Orange.
Before playing at Hopkins, Huntley was twice awarded the All-Metro High School Player of the Year by the Baltimore Sun while playing at Calvert Hall College High School. In addition, as a sixteen-year-old, he represented Team Canada at the 2003 Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships, helping his team win the silver medal.
Huntley and his father Dave Huntley, a former All-American midfielder at Johns Hopkins, are the only father–son duo to win two national championships, and are only the second pairing to score 100 or more goals each in their respective Division I lacrosse careers.
Professional career.
Huntley began his professional career with the Los Angeles Riptide in 2008. Originally drafted by the San Francisco Dragons 17th overall in the 2008 MLL Collegiate Draft, Huntley was immediately traded to the Riptide on draft day. Huntley joined a Riptide team that was coached by Huntley family friend John Tucker.
Huntley has had an immediate impact on the league, and was named Rookie of the Week three times, Offensive Player of the Week once. He also set a record for the most number of goals scored by a rookie in Major League Lacrosse, breaking Adam Doneger's mark set in 2003. Following the season, Huntley was presented the Major League Lacrosse Rookie of the Year Award.
On February 12, 2010 it was announced Huntley was traded to the Toronto Nationals along with four other players.

The Price Creek Lighthouse, also known as the Price's Creek Lighthouse, is a structure located near Southport, North Carolina. It was one of two range lights at Price Creek in a series of lights to guide ships from Cape Fear to Wilmington, North Carolina.
History.
In 1849, a two-story, brick lightkeeper's house with a wooden lantern was built as one of the lights. During the American Civil War, this served the Confederacy as a signal house to communicate between Fort Fisher and Fort Caswell. This house was destroyed by storms.
The second range light is a conical brick tower originally tall with a base diameter of . The light was approximately above sea level. The bricks had been imported from England. It originally had eight lamps with reflectors measuring in diameter. The tower was later extended to a height of , but suffered damage from shells during the Civil War. The lantern has been removed.
The surviving range light is located at the edge of Archer Daniels Midland's industrial site on the bank of the Cape Fear River. It is currently in private hands, but can be best viewed from the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry or from the ferryboat landing at Southport.

Enrico Gennari

Enrico Gennari (born 1977-01-21) is a marine biologist who specialises in the study of the great white shark.
Early life and education.
Gennari was born in Rome (Italy) the 21st January 1977. At 6 years of age he had proclaimed he was going to study the great white shark.
His university career in Rome culminated in a masters degree in Natural Science at the university of Rome “La Sapienza” in February 2004 (magna cum laude). His degree thesis was on a vertebral ageing study in Etmopterus spinax, a bottom-dwelling shark typical of the Mediterranean sea, creating a new technique to “read” for the first time ever very difficult vertebra.
Gennari decided to have a year break in order to dedicate time to his other passion: scuba diving. So he spent a summer in Ustica, near Sicily (Italy), working as a dive master. He then worked with Ryan Johnson for 9 months during 2005, when they got insights into many white shark characteristics, some of them unknown till then, like the night time predatory behaviour of the white shark, as can be watched on the National Geographic documentary “Sharkville”. In 2005 they conducted the longest ever manual track of a single white shark: 103 hours, almost 5 days.
He then enrolled at Rhodes University for his PhD study on the thermo physio-ecology of the white shark under the supervision of Dr. Paul Cowley from SAIAB and Ryan Johnson. At the same time he and three other marine researchers (Johnson, Stephen Swanson and Toby Keswick) decided to create a private marine research institute focused on marine top predator called the Oceans Research. At present Gennari is researching for his PhD in Mossel Bay trying to disclose the secrets behind the endothermic ability of the great white shark to elevate parts of its body warmer than the external water temperature.
In 2008 Gennari, as a member of Oceans Research, initiated a great white shark research internship program that allows students from around the world to gain practical research skills.

Hysterocrates gigas

Hysterocrates gigas or the Giant baboon spider, is a member of the tarantula family, Theraphosidae. It is also known as the Cameroon red baboon spider.
Description.
This is a burrowing spider and ranges in color from a dull black and gray to a rusty orange/brown. It is black when freshly moulted (post-moult) and turns brown just before a moult (pre-moult). Its eyes are small and weak and only able to judge light levels.
Its abdomen is oval in shape with a diameter up to . Although it has hairy legs, this tarantula is an Old World species and does not have urticating hairs on its abdomen. (Urticating hairs are hairs found in most new world species (those from North and South America) that can be shed in defence, they are barbed and may cause severe itching.)
It also has a leg span which may reach . This tarantula, in common with the rest of the family, has downward-facing, parallel fangs, used like pickaxes rather than pincers.
Adult males have smaller abdomens than females. Male pedipalps are club shaped, but it may take up to 4 years for differences between male and female to show, since the average male lifespan is about 4 years and the leg span of the male is roughly 5”. These tarantulas spin very little silk - what silk they do spin is used for egg sacs or to line their burrows - they do not make webs. These tarantulas in particular burrow very intricate burrows.
Distribution.
"Hysterocrates gigas" is found in Cameroon.
Habitat.
This species lives in tropical and sub-tropical environments. According to Sam Marshall (an arachnologist, and subject of the book "The Tarantula Scientist"), they dig particularly intricate burrows. They need temperatures of 70 - 95 degrees F. and high humidity in their environment (between 60%-90%). They are naturally found at ground level in tropical rain forests.
Food.
These tarantulas will eat other invertebrates, such as crickets, cockroaches, butterflies, moths and other spiders or small vertebrates, such as mice, lizards, frogs, snakes and occasionally birds. They are also known to be one of the only swimming spiders and will occasionally dive to catch fish.
They kill their prey with their venom, inject digestive juices into the body of their prey and suck up the resulting liquid.
Reproduction and Development.
Females lay eggs in an egg sac that may contain hundreds of eggs. Spiderlings live together for up to 6 months, though some tarantulas from the same sac are believed to co-habitate long after and even share burrows and tunnel systems. Most spiderlings will kill each other for food, but these spiderlings have actually been found to share food with their siblings. Spiderlings are very difficult to see. Their mother will kill prey for them. In their first year of life, spiderlings molt up to 8 times. Females usually molt about once a year after maturity and depending on how much the tarantula is fed, it will result in more frequent molts inevitably resulting in faster maturing.
Behavior.
Adaptations: These tarantulas are opportunistic, nocturnal hunters and will take whatever prey they find. The venom of these tarantulas is not medically significant, but may cause some nausea, though if the victim is abnormally sensitive medical attention may be required. Spider venom is normally intended for prey items though the spider will attack humans if provoked. There has been only one known fatality associated with a tarantula, and that was in Central America when the person died of a secondary infection in a pre-antibiotic era.
To defend themselves, they rear up aggressively on their hind legs in a threatening posture, smack their front legs on the ground and a sound comparable to the tearing of velcro can be produced by rubbing leg pairs I and II together. Although they may also bite, their main alternate defence is to run away. The name "tarantula" is commonly given to spiders in this family. It is a misnomer - it was originally given to a smaller wolf spider from Taranto, Italy, where, in the Middle Ages, people danced themselves into a trance - called the tarantella - in an attempt to purge the effects of the wolf spider's bite.
These tarantulas moult by splitting of the old exoskeleton and wriggling out of it. They pull their legs out of their old skeletons as we pull our fingers out of gloves. A new exoskeleton has grown underneath and remains soft for about a week. The tarantula stretches his new skeleton to allow for growth space and the new skeleton hardens. During and after the molt, which may take hours to complete, the tarantula is weak and dehydrated. During this time the tarantula is lying on its back with its legs in the air, very vulnerable to other creatures - even some that would normally be its prey.
Fangs are part of the exoskeleton and are shed as well. The tarantula avoids eating for a week after to make sure that its new fangs have hardened. A lost limb may be fully or partially regenerated during a moult.
Threats.
Its natural enemies are mammals, birds, reptiles, wasps, ants and amphibians, which prey on them. They are also collected as pets by humans.

Wendy St. Kitts

Wendy St. Kitts is a singer and songwriter. Hailing from the Caribbean in the federation of St. Kitts and Nevis (birthplace of Joan Armatrading). Going up, Wendy St. Kitts dreamed in rock and pop music although she was surrounded by Calypso. She cites Joan Armatrading, Adele, Coldplay, and Barbra Streisand as some of her influences.
Career beginnings.
As a child Wendy St. Kitts spent her summers in New York City where she eventually relocated and struggled to build her music career. "Man, it was as tough as it should be. Selling sex was and I guess is the thing to do, but that's just not me. So, like many others, I took the long, hard road of certified rejection and truly discovered who I was. Still the best thing I've ever done."
Albums
In 2004, Wendy self-released the LP "Windy Road" in her native country of St. Kitts-Nevis. Driven by the single "Don't Lie to Me", Wendy returned to St. Kitts for her first headlining concert in May 2004. In April 2008, St. Kitts released her first full-length professionally produced EP, "Woman Empowered". Vocally, she moved from a roar to a whisper with ease. R. Hendix, Music Supervisor MTV New York City said of her: "Wendy has a big voice; a great voice. Her music is really big." With "Woman Empowered", the music inside reflected the journey and musical rebirth of a woman committed to transforming lives through her music and self-expression. VividNurban.com said about Wendy St. Kitts, "This songstress has a presence and a voice that is guaranteed to move the most rebellious of crowds just by the passion with which she delivers her material.". 
In support of "Woman Empowered", during 2008-2009, Wendy and her band embarked on a small tour throughout New York City and Washington D.C.
2010-2012.
After the 2008 EP release, Wendy St. Kitts picked up the guitar and focused on growing as a songwriter. Wendy continued to write songs that reflected her musical voice and sound. In late 2011, she began performing her new songs at local pubs in the UK. About her music, Wendy says "Songwriting is something I give myself. It is a ceaseless passion of which I'm grateful. When the music connects with people, it compels me to keep it honest and keep at it."
Wendy St. Kitts’ yet to be titled LP is scheduled for release in 2012.

Peggy Bacon

Margaret Frances "Peggy" Bacon (May 2, 1895 – January 4, 1987) was an American printmaker, illustrator, painter and writer. Bacon was known for her humorous and ironic etchings and drawings, as well as for her satirical caricatures of prominent personalities in the late 1920s and 1930s.
Early personal life.
Bacon was born on May 2, 1895 in Ridgefield, Connecticut to Charles Roswell Bacon and Elizabeth Chase Bacon. She was the first of three children but raised an only child after her two younger brothers died in infancy. Bacon's parents were both artists and met while attending the Art Students League in New York.
Bacon's parents moved frequently. The family lived in Connecticut but spent winters in New York and in the winter of 1902 they lived in Nassau, Bermuda. Between the ages of 9 and 11 Bacon lived with her parents in France, first in Paris and then in a house in Picardy at Montreaux-sur-Mer. Bacon's mother did not believe in formal schooling and as a result, for most of her childhood, Bacon had tutors and studied only subjects of interest to her, such as Latin, Greek, mythology, ancient history and geography of the ancient world. Bacon described her unconventional childhood as "absolutely delightful."
At the age of fourteen, Bacon began attending Kent Place School, a boarding school in Summit, New Jersey. In 1913, the same year she graduated, Bacon's father killed himself in his studio in New York. He had overcome alcoholism but was susceptible to bouts of depression. After this devastating event Bacon and her mother moved to New York City and lived on the West Side in the home of family friends.
Artistic career.
Bacon had always been interested in art and from a very young age her early artistic interests were encouraged and supported by her parents, but Bacon did not receive formal training in art until after graduating from Kent Place School. At the end of 1913, Bacon first studied art at the School of Applied Design for Women but disliked it calling it, 
"the prissiest, silliest place that ever was." She transferred after a few weeks to the School of Fine and Applied Arts on the West Wide where she took classes in illustration and life drawing. During the summer of 1914 Bacon attended Jonas Lie's landscape class in Port Jefferson, Long Island.
From 1915-1920 Bacon studied painting with Kenneth Hayes Miller, John Sloan, George Bellows and others at the Art Students League. While at the League, Bacon became friends with several other artists. Her circle of friends and acquaintances included Dorothea Schwarz (Greenbaum), Anne Rector (Duffy), Betty Burroughs (Woodhouse), Katherine Schmidt (Kuniyoshi Shubert), Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Molly Luce, Dorothy Varian, Edmund Duffy, Dick Dyer, David Morrison, and Andrew Dasburg. Looking back at her time at the League Bacon said, "The years at the Art Students League were a very important chunk of life to me and very exhilarating. It was the first time in my life, of course, that I had met and gotten to know familiarly a group of young people who were all headed the same way with the same interests. In fact it was practically parochial." In 1917, she exhibited two works in the "First Annual Exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists" (April 10-May 6, 1917). Around 1917 Bacon also became interested in printmaking and taught herself drypoint as there was no one teaching etching at the Art Students League at the time. Bacon's first caricature prints were featured in single-issue, satirical magazine "Bad News", which was published by Bacon and her fellow art students in 1918. Drypoint was Bacon's primary medium until 1927. Although Bacon had trained as a painter, she eventually became famous for her satirical prints and drawings.
In the summer of 1919 Bacon studied with Andrew Dasburg in Woodstock, New York. That same summer she was engaged to American painter Alexander Brook and the two married on May 4, 1920. After marrying, Bacon and Brook moved to London for a year, where their daughter Belinda was born. When they returned, the family divided their time between Greenwich Village in New York City and Woodstock, New York, two vibrant artist communities. In 1922 a son, Sandy, was born in Woodstock. In 1940 Bacon and her husband divorced.
Bacon was a very prolific artist. In 1919, at the age of 24, she wrote and illustrated her first book, "The True Philosopher and Other Cat Tales". She went on to illustrate over 60 books, 19 of which she also wrote, including a successful mystery book, "The Inward Eye", which was nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe award in 1952 for best novel. Bacon's popular drawings appeared in magazines such as "The New Yorker", "New Republic", "Fortune", and "Vanity Fair" and she exhibited in galleries and museums frequently. Bacon had over thirty solo exhibitions at such venues as Montross Gallery, Alfred Stieglitz's Intimate Gallery, and the Downtown Gallery. In 1934 Bacon was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship for creative work in the graphic arts. During her time as a fellow she completed 35 satirical portraits of art world figures for a collection called "Off With Their Heads!", which was published that same year by Robert M. McBride & Company. In 1942 she was granted an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and in 1980 the Academy awarded her a gold medal for her lifelong contribution to illustration and graphic art. In 1947, Bacon was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1969. In December 1975, the National Collection of Fine Arts, now the National Museum of American Art, honored Bacon with a yearlong retrospective exhibition titled, "Peggy Bacon: Personalities and Places." 
In addition to her artistic career, Bacon taught extensively during the 1930s and 1940s at various institutions, including the Feildston School, the Art Students League, Hunter College, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington DC, and summers at the School of Music and Art in Stowe, Vermont.
Later life and legacy.
In the 1970s Bacon's eyesight began failing and she eventually went to live with her son, in Cape Porpoise, Maine. She died in 1987 at the age of 91 in Kennebunk, Maine.

Ben Kantarovski

Ben Kantarovski (born 20 January 1992 in Newcastle, Australia) is an Australian football (soccer) player who plays for the Newcastle Jets in the A-League.
Club career.
Newcastle Jets.
Kantarovski was signed to a four-year contract by the Newcastle Jets in January 2008 while attending Lambton High School at only 15 years of age, making him the youngest player in A-League history to sign a full-time A-League contract, and one of the youngest players in world football to do so. He made his A-League debut in Round 1 of the 2008-09 season against the Central Coast Mariners playing as a defender. He was only 16 years and 208 days old making him at the time, the youngest player in A-League history. Kantarovski has since played in many different positions for the Newcastle Jets, including all positions across the defence, and all positions across the midfield, most commonly his preferred holding midfielder role. Kantarovski was named the Newcastle Jets Player of the Season in his debut year, despite only playing a handful of games.
Kantarovski has already attracted the interest of one of the powerhouses of German, European and world football, Bayern Munich. Kantarovksi spent a week trialling with the Bundesliga giants in April, 2009. At the conclusion of this trial, it appeared Bayern's interest in Kantarovski only grew, making it increasingly likely that Kantarovksi would depart the A-League for Bayern once he reached the age of 18, FIFA's minimum age for a football player to play for a foreign club. After turning 18, Kantarovski opted to turn down an offer to join Bayern Munich's youth system. He did so after receiving the Kimon Taliadoros scholarship for his educational achievements.
On 12 November 2010, Kantarovski signed a 3-year contract extension keeping him at the Jets until the end of the 2013. He scored his first goal for the club with a header against Brisbane Roar in a 1-1 at EnergyAustralia Stadium on 17 November 2010.
International career.
Kantarovski has represented Australia's U-17 team on 12 occasions, scoring 3 times. In 2009, he represented the U-20 team at the U-20's World Cup as the youngest player in the squad, being a mere 17 years of age, starting in all of their group games, playing as a midfielder in the first game, before being shifted in to the heart of defence. Despite suffering from a knee injury that would eventually sideline him for 6 months, Kantarovski played for Young Socceroos throughout their World Cup campaign, and was a clear standout, named by many as the Socceroo's top player.
Kantarovski was called up by Socceroos coach Pim Verbeek into the Socceroos squad to play Kuwait in the AFC Asian Cup qualifying game against Kuwait, as well as inviting Ben to a training camp with the Socceroos squad.
Kantarovksi was selected by Young Socceroos coach Jan Verslejen to captain the Young Socceroos despite being one of the youngest players in the squad. Verslejen cited Kantarovski's Hyundai A-League and AFC Champions League experience, as well as being a member of the Young Socceroos U-20 World Cup campaign as three big reasons for his appointment as captain. He also captained the Young Socceroos to victory in the 2010 Asean Football Federation Under-19 Championship, after their 1-0 win in the final against Thailand.
On 27 January 2012 he was selected to play for the Australia Olympic football team against Uzbekistan national under-23 football team and United Arab Emirates national under-23 football team. Kantarovski made his debut for the Australia Olympic football team in the London 2012 Olympic Qualifier against the United Arab Emirates at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium on February 22, 2012.

Tweet Zoo

Tweet Zoo is a Merrie Melodies cartoon animated short starring Tweety and Sylvester. Released January 12, 1957, the cartoon was directed by Friz Freleng. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc.
Plot.
The cartoon, set in a city zoo, begins with a tour guide showing various animal exhibits to visitors. The final stop (at least as far as viewers can see) is the exhibit featuring the "one and only example" of the Tweety Bird species. This draws tag-along tourist Sylvester's interest. After the requisite "I tawt I taw a puddy tat" lines, Sylvester begins his latest pursuit.
The attempts, all unsuccessful, are as follows:
In the end, a frustrated Sylvester leaves the zoo and strikes birds off his diet list ... just before a cluster of birds land on his shoulders and head as he is walking away, muttering about his awful timing for going on a diet.

Bleak (band)

Bleak is a Finnish rock band formed in 1997 and split in 2009. Bleak is now known as Fireal. 
Bleak stuck strictly to grunge during the first years of its career. The new millennium saw the band take a short breather, but Bleak regrouped in 2002, armed with a new, broader musical outlook. Today, the band's music is supposedly a reflection of the eternally bleak ethos of the band members, coated with an earthy penchant for melody, all served continental style.
The band worked on a grass roots level for some time, and their self-financed single 'Crossword' was in rotation at several rock radio stations. Radio airplay and live performances gave them the beginnings of a solid fanbase. Asko Kallonen and Niko Nordström from Helsinki Music Company took an interest in the band and soon signed Bleak. The first fruits of the new partnership came in the form of the single 'Play', which debuted on the official Finnish singles chart at number 2. The song also found its way to the playlists of both Radio City and YleX.
Bleak recorded the album 'Inside' at the same time that Ana Johnsson was recording the album 'Little Angel' in Finland, this resulted in their collaboration for the main song for the Jadesoturi (Jade Warrior) movie "Fate" the song received the award for 'Best Nordic Song' at the NRJ Radio Awards in 2007.

Measurex

Measurex was an American company based in Cupertino, California. Measurex was one of the first companies to develop computer control systems for industry, primarily the paper-making industry. The development of the control systems included the development of control software, and development of scanning sensors to measure different properties of paper. The company was acquired by Honeywell in March 1997, at a price tag of almost $600 million. At the acquisition, Measurex had 2,250 employees in 30 countries and a revenue of $254 million.
History.
Early years.
Measurex was conceived in 1967 by David A. "Dave" Bossen, then a sales manager at Industrial Nucleonics, and the new company opened its doors on January 18, 1968, in Santa Clara, California. It was first a garage set-up based on paper industry experiences (circa 1966) at 330 Mathew Street, but later moved several miles southwest to Cupertino to an old cannery property. Ground was broken for the new headquarters in July 1971 and it opened the following year. Its initial public offering of 60,000 shares was completed on March 28, 1972, trading as symbol MSRX on NASDAQ. In 1973, a plant was opened in Waterford, Ireland, in June and was added to the Cupertino campus.
The use of mini-computers was a part of the business plan, and Measurex initially used the Hewlett Packard 2116B mini-computer in the MX1000 (1968) and MX2000 (1974)systems. Later on, with the MX2001 systems (1977), Measurex used the 21MX mini-computer.
In 1978, was added in Cupertino, the Waterford plant expanded to , and a new facility in Ireland was constructed in Cork. By the end of the year, nearly 1,000 systems had been installed in 25 countries and Measurex had more than 1,800 employees worldwide.
Starting with the MX2002 systems in 1980, Measurex started to use the DEC LSI 11. Intel based system was introduced with the MX2002 Vision systems (using Intel 8086) in 1983, but still with the LSI 11 as a Scanner Support Processor (SSP). The reason for keeping the older LSI 11 in the architecture, was the computer's ability of near real-time processing of gauge data and also the LSI 11's support for hardware interrupts.
Acquisition of Devron.
Measurex acquired the North Vancouver firm Devron-Hercules Inc. in 1991. Devron was a company specializing in solutions for Cross Directional optimization of the paper sheet in paper machines.
Acquisition of Roibox.
In April 1993, Measurex acquired the Finnish company Roibox Oy, for approximately $1.7 million.
Honeywell-Measurex.
Honeywell kept the name Measurex for a number of years after the acquisition, giving the subsidiary the name Honeywell-Measurex.
Development of Sensors.
Early sensors were almost exclusively based on continuous process pulp and paper making, beginning with basis weight, moisture, caliper and whiteness. Later sensors were developed for new industries, including tire calendaring, cigarette fill, aluminum rolling mill gage thickness and others. Some of the early sensors were based on emissions from radioactive source materials it would probably be difficult - or impossible - for a similar firm to use today in the same way.
Service.
Measurex had a service business that was 40% of the annual revenue. Most of the mills at the time could not support computer control system, and at the same time get an up-time of 99% or better. Measurex provided dedicated, on-site service for this, since it was a very expensive investment for a mill to train a technician.
Customers of Measurex systems reported that the dedication and expertise of the service organization was a considerable factor in creating the customer confidence that resulted in sales growth, especially the repeat sales that fueled the remarkable growth during the 25 years leading up to the acquisition by Honeywell. As founder Dave Bossen often told service personnel: "Our results are far greater with a superior field service organization working with average systems, compared to manufacturing superior systems, but installed and maintained by an average field service organization". Of course, he was also quite emphatic about having manufacturing produce superior systems as well, resulting in their standing as a lead supplier of quality and control systems for the paper industry.
Results Guarantee.
One business strategy for Measurex was the "Result Guarantee", which allowed the customer to return the Measurex system. This allowed customers to gain confidence in the systems. In 1975 a company wide competition was held for employees to name the new street upon which the new Measurex facilities were built. None of the employee submittals was selected and founder Dave Bossen chose "1 Results Way" to amplify the company's commitment to results. (not quite the whole story, the selection committee gave the award for the name to the employee who submitted "Digital Drive" but Dave changed it to "Results Way" stating that Digital was a technology with only temporary relevance and what if the street had been named a few years earlier as "Analog Ave")

Jonathan Jasper Wright

Jonathan Jasper Wright was an African-American lawyer who served as a judge on the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina during Reconstruction from 1870 to 1877.
Biography.
Wright was born on February 11, 1840, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. When he was about six years old his parents removed to Montrose, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. He attended the district school during the winter months, working for the neighboring farmers the rest of the year. Having saved up a small sum of money he entered the Lancasterian University, at Ithaca, in New York State. After a thorough course of study there returned to the village where his parents resided, and entered the office of a law firm, where he read law for two years, supporting himself by teaching. He subsequently entered the office of Judge Collins, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, with whom he read law for another year. Feeling himself qualified for the legal profession, he applied for admission to the Bar; but so great was the existing prejudice against African Americans that the Committee refused to examine him.
In April 1865, Wright was sent by the American Missionary Society to Beaufort, South Carolina, as a teacher and laborer among the freed slaves. He remained in Beaufort until the Civil Rights Act passed. Then he returned to Montrose, Pennsylvania, and demanded an examination. The Committee found him qualified, and recommended his admission to the Bar. He was admitted August 13, 1865, being the first African American admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania. In April, 1866, Wright was appointed by General Oliver Otis Howard, head of the Freedmen's Bureau, to be the legal adviser for the freedmen in Beaufort. In July 1868 he was elected to the Constitutional Convention of South Carolina. He was the convention vice-president and helped draft the judiciary section of the State Constitution, which remains today. Wright was soon afterward elected Senator from the county Beaufort. On February 1, 1870, he was elected to the South Carolina Supreme Court. He served for seven years and then entered into private practice in Charleston. He died in 1885.

Jaws (franchise)

Jaws is an American film franchise that consists of a novel, four films, a theme park ride, and other tie-in merchandise. The franchise primarily focuses on a great white shark, and its attacks on people in specific areas of the United States. The Brody family is featured in all of the films as the primary antithesis to the shark. The original film was based on a novel written by Peter Benchley, which itself was inspired by the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916. Benchley would adapt his own work, along with help from Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, into the 1975 film "Jaws", which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Although Gottlieb would go on to pen two of the three sequels, neither Benchley or Spielberg would return to the film series in any capacity.
The first film was regarded as a watershed film in motion picture history; it became the father of the summer blockbuster movies and one of the first "high-concept" films. The film is also known for the introduction of John Williams' famous theme music, which was a simple alternating pattern of the E and F notes of a piano. Williams' theme would go on to win an Academy Award. The film would win other Academy Awards, and even be nominated for Best Picture.
The success of "Jaws" led to three sequels, which have amassed almost $800 million worldwide in box office gross. The franchise has also seen the release of various soundtrack albums, additional novelizations based on the sequels, trading cards, inspired theme park rides at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Japan, multiple video games, and a musical that premiered in 2004. Although the first film was popular with critics when it was originally released, the sequels have generally been seen negatively by critics. This reception has spread to the merchandise, with video games seen as poor imitations of the original concept. Nevertheless, the original 1975 film has generally been regarded as one of the greatest films ever, and frequently appears in the top 100 of various American Film Institute rankings. Jaws is also considered by some to be the last of the great Universal Monsters.
Overview.
The original "Jaws", directed by Steven Spielberg is based on Peter Benchley's novel of the same name. It tells the story of Police Chief of Amity Island, a fictional summer resort town, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), in his quest to protect beachgoers from a great white shark by closing the beach. This is overruled by the town council, headed by the Mayor (Murray Hamilton) that wants the beach to remain open in order to sustain the local tourist economy. After several attacks, the police chief enlists the help of a marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw). The three voyage out onto the ocean in Quint's boat "Orca". The shark kills the fisherman, but Brody manages to destroy the shark by shooting at the highly pressurized air tank that he has wedged in its mouth.
The first sequel, "Jaws 2", depicts the same town four years after the events of the original film, when another great white shark arrives on the shores of fictional seaside resort of Amity Island. Directed by Jeannot Szwarc and starring Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, who, after a series of deaths and disappearances, suspects that the culprit is another shark. However, he has trouble convincing the town's selectmen. He has to act alone to save the group of teenagers, including his two sons, who encounter the shark whilst out sailing.
The plot of "Jaws 3-D" moves away from Amity Island to SeaWorld in Florida, a water theme-park with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares to open, it is infiltrated by a baby great white shark which attacks and kills water-skiers and park employees. Once the baby shark is captured, it becomes apparent that a much larger shark, the mother, is present. The characters of Martin's sons from the first two films are developed in this film: Michael Brody (Dennis Quaid) is the chief engineer, and his younger brother Sean (John Putch) arrives at the resort to visit. The events of the earlier films are implied through Sean's dislike of the water because of "something that happened when he was a kid". The events and character development from "Jaws 3-D" is independent from the rest of the series.
In the fourth film "," the story line returns to Amity Island, but ignores all plot elements introduced in "Jaws:3-D." No mention is made of Michael's girlfriend, Katherine Morgan (Bess Armstrong), or his career change from engineer at SeaWorld to a marine biologist. In fact, one of the Universal Studios press releases for "Jaws: The Revenge" omits "Jaws 3-D" by referring to "Jaws: The Revenge" as the ""third" film of the remarkable "Jaws" trilogy." By the start of the film, Martin Brody had died of a heart attack, although his wife, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), claims that he died through fear of the shark. Her youngest son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), now working as a police deputy in Amity, is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy. As he does so, he is attacked and killed by a shark. Ellen becomes convinced that a shark is deliberately victimizing her family for the deaths of the first two sharks. Michael (Lance Guest) convinces her to spend some time with his family in The Bahamas. However, as his job involves a lot of time on and in the sea, Ellen fears that he will be the shark's next victim. When her granddaughter, Thea (Judith Barsi), narrowly avoids being attacked by a shark, Ellen takes a boat in order to kill her family's alleged stalker. Hoagie (Michael Caine), Michael and his friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles) find Ellen, and then proceedes to electrocute the shark, driving it out of the water and impaling it on the prow of Ellen's boat.
Films.
Novel.
Peter Benchley had been thinking for years "about a story about a shark that attacks people and what would happen if it came in and wouldn't go away." Doubleday editor Tom Congdon was interested in Benchley's idea of a novel about a great white shark terrorizing a beach resort. After various revisions and rewrites, Benchley delivered his final draft in January 1973. The title was not decided until shortly before the book went to print. Benchley says that he had spent months thinking of titles, many of which he calls "pretentious", such as "The Stillness in the Water" and "Leviathan Rising". Benchley regarded other ideas, such as "The Jaws of Death" and "The Jaws of Leviathan", as "melodramatic, weird or pretentious". According to Benchley, the novel still did not have a title until twenty minutes before production of the book.
The Book of the Month Club made the novel an "A book", qualifying it for its main selection, then the "Reader's Digest" also selected it. The publication date was moved back to allow a carefully orchestrated release. It was released first in hardcover in February 1974, then in the book clubs, followed by a national campaign for the paperback release. Bantam bought the paperback rights for $575,000.
Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, film producers at Universal Pictures, heard about the book at identical times at different locations. Brown heard about it in the fiction department of "Cosmopolitan", a lifestyle magazine then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment "might make a good movie". The producers each read it overnight and agreed that it was "the most exciting thing that they had ever read" and that, although they were unsure how they would accomplish it, they had to produce the film. Brown says that had they read the book twice they would have never have made the film because of the difficulties in executing some of the sequences. However, he says that "we just loved the book. We thought it would make a very good movie."
Production.
Zanuck and Brown had originally planned to hire John Sturges to direct the film, before considering Dick Richards. However, they grew irritated by Richards' vision of continually calling the shark "the whale"; Richards was subsequently dropped from the project. Zanuck and Brown then signed Spielberg in June 1973 to direct before the release of his first theatrical film, "The Sugarland Express". Spielberg wanted to take the novel's basic concept, removing Benchley's many subplots. Zanuck, Brown and Spielberg removed the novel's adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper because it would compromise the camaraderie between the men when they went out on the "Orca".
Peter Benchley wrote three drafts of the screenplay before deciding to bow out of the project. Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Howard Sackler happened to be in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite, and since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchley's drafts, they quickly accepted his offer. Spielberg sent the script to Carl Gottlieb, asking for advice. Gottlieb rewrote most scenes during principal photography, and John Milius contributed dialogue polishes. Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft. The authorship of Quint's monologue about the fate of the cruiser has caused substantial controversy as to who deserves the most credit for the speech. Spielberg described it as a collaboration among John Milius, Howard Sackler, and actor Robert Shaw. Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius' contribution.
Three mechanical sharks were made for the production: a full version for underwater shots, one that moved from camera-left to right (with its hidden side completely exposing the internal machinery), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered. Their construction was supervised by production designer Joe Alves and special effects artist Bob Mattey. After the sharks were completed, they were shipped to the shooting location, but had not been tested in water and when placed in the ocean the full model sank to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it. Location shooting occurred on the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, chosen because the ocean had a sandy bottom while out at sea. This helped the mechanical sharks to operate smoothly and still provide a realistic location. The film nonetheless had a famously troubled shoot and went considerably over budget. David Brown said that the budget "was $4 million and the picture wound up costing $9 million". Shooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras were soaked, and the "Orca" once began to sink with the actors on board. The mechanical shark frequently malfunctioned, due to the hydraulic innards being corroded by salt water. The three mechanical sharks were collectively nicknamed "Bruce" by the production team after Spielberg's lawyer. To some degree, the delays in the production proved serendipitous. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot most of the scenes with the shark only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is represented by the floating yellow barrels. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin due to its ease of filming. This forced restraint is widely thought to have increased the suspense of these scenes, giving it a Hitchcockian tone.
The studio ordered a sequel early into the success of "Jaws". The success of "The Godfather Part II" and other sequels meant that the producers were under pressure to deliver a bigger and better shark. They realized that someone else would produce the film if they didn't, and they preferred to be in charge of the project themselves. Spielberg declined to be involved in the sequel.
Like the first film, the production of "Jaws 2" was troubled. The original director, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film and was replaced by Jeannot Szwarc. Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc. Martha's Vineyard was again used as the location for the town scenes. Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing. The majority of filming was at Navarre Beach, Florida, because of the warm weather and the water's depth being appropriate for the shark platform. Like the first film, shooting on water proved challenging. After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction. The corrosive effect of the saltwater damaged some equipment, including the metal parts in the sharks. As with the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers Ron & Valerie Taylor was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.
The producers of the first two films considered originally pitched the second "Jaws" sequel as a spoof named "Jaws 3, People 0". "National Lampoon" writers John Hughes and Todd Carroll were commissioned to write a script. The project was abandoned due to conflicts with Universal Studios.
Alan Landsburg bought the rights to produce the third film. The second sequel capitalized upon the revived interest of 3-D film in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as "Friday the 13th Part III" and "Amityville 3-D" that also make dual use of the number three. As it was Joe Alves' first film as director, having been the production designer for the first two films, he thought that 3-D would "give him an edge". Cinema audiences could wear disposable cardboard polarized glasses to create the illusion that elements penetrate the screen. Richard Matheson worked on the story and script, although many of his contributions were unused: the writer is unhappy with the finished film. Carl Gottlieb, who had also revised the screenplays for the first two "Jaws" films, was credited for the script alongside Matheson.
Joseph Sargent produced and directed the fourth and final film in the series. "Jaws The Revenge" was filmed on location in New England and in the Caribbean, and completed on the Universal lot. Like the first two films of the series, Martha's Vineyard was the location of the fictional Amity Island for the opening scenes of the film. Principal photography moved to Nassau in The Bahamas, but the location did not offer the "perfect world" that the 38-day shoot required. The cast and crew encountered many problems with varying weather conditions.
In February 2010, film website Cinema Blend reported that a source from Universal Pictures has indicated that Universal is "strongly considering" remaking "Jaws" in 3-D, following the commercial success of "Avatar". The source also reported that "30 Rock" star Tracy Morgan was considered to portray Matt Hooper in the remake, which they say could be more comedic and make more use of special effects. The studio has not officially commented upon the rumor.
Music.
John Williams composed and conducted the score for the first two films. The main "shark" theme, a simple alternating pattern of two notes, E and F, became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger. Williams described the theme as having the "effect of grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable." When the piece was first played for Spielberg, he was said to have laughed at Williams, thinking that it was a joke. Spielberg later said that without Williams' score the film would have been only half as successful, and Williams acknowledges that the score jumpstarted his career. Williams won an Academy Award for Original Music Score for his work on the first film.
The shark theme is used in all three sequels, a continuity that Williams compares to "the great tradition" for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as Roy Rogers and The Lone Ranger. Alan Parker composed and conducted the score for "Jaws 3-D", while the final film was scored by Michael Small. The latter was particularly praised for his work, which many critics considered superior to the film.
Box office.
"Jaws" was the first film to use "wide release" as a distribution pattern. As such, it is an important film in the history of film distribution and marketing. Prior to the release of "Jaws", films typically opened slowly, usually in a few theaters in major cities, which allowed for a series of "premieres." As the success of a film increased, and word of mouth grew, distributors would forward the prints to additional cities across the country. The film became the first to use extensive television advertising. Universal executive Sidney Sheinberg's rationale was that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print than if a slow, scaled release were carried out. Scheinberg's gamble paid off, with "Jaws" becoming a box office smash hit and the father of the summer blockbuster.
When "Jaws" was released on June 20, 1975, it opened at 464 theaters. The release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to a total of 675 theaters, the largest simultaneous distribution of a film in motion picture history at the time. During the first weekend of wide release, "Jaws" grossed more than $7 million, and was the top grosser for the following five weeks. During its run in theaters, the film became the first to reach more than $100 million in U.S. box office receipts. "Jaws" eventually grossed more than $470 million worldwide ($ billion in 2010 dollars) and was the highest grossing box office film until "" debuted two years later.
"Jaws 2" was the most expensive film that Universal had produced up until that point, costing the studio almost $30 million. According to David Brown, the film made 40% gross of the original. This was attractive to studios because it reduced market risk. The film became the highest-grossing sequel in history, succeeded by the release of "Rocky II" in 1979. It opened in 640 theaters, making $9,866,023 in its opening weekend. The final domestic gross for "Jaws 2" was $81,766,007, making it the sixth highest domestic grossing film of 1978.
"Jaws 3-D" grossed $13,422,500 on its opening weekend, playing to 1,311 theaters at its widest release. It has achieved total lifetime worldwide gross of $87,987,055. Despite being #1 at the box office, this illustrates the series' diminishing returns, since "Jaws 3-D" has earned nearly $100,000,000 less than the total lifetime gross of its predecessor and $300,000,000 less than the original film.
The third sequel would attract an even lower income, with around two thirds of "Jaws 3-D"'s total lifetime gross. "Jaws: The Revenge" received a poor critical reception, and earned the lowest amount of money from the franchise. It is considered one of the worst movies ever made. Even though it received negative reviews, the film was able to cover costs (estimated US$23 million) with a worldwide box office take of $51,881,013. The film, though, continued the series diminishing returns. It only grossed $7,154,890 in its opening weekend, when it opened to 1,606 screens. This was around $5 million less than its predecessor. It has also achieved the lowest total lifetime gross of the series.
Critical reception.
"Jaws" is regarded as a watershed film in motion picture history, the father of the summer blockbuster movie and one of the first "high concept" films. Due to the film's success in advance screenings, studio executives decided to distribute it in a much wider release than ever before. "The Omen" followed suit in the summer of 1976 and then "" one year later in 1977, cementing the notion for movie studios to distribute their big-release action and adventure pictures (commonly referred to as "tentpole pictures") during the summer. "Jaws" is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. "Jaws" was number 48 on American Film Institute's "100 Years... 100 Movies", a list of the greatest American films of all time, dropping down to number 56 on the 10 Year Anniversary list. It was ranked second on a similar list for thrillers, "100 Years... 100 Thrills".
The sequels are not held in such high regard. Many reviewers criticized director Jeannot Szwarc for showing more of the shark than the first film had, reducing the Hitchcockian notion "that the greatest suspense derives from the unseen and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster." However, the performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton were praised., although the teenagers, who are "irritating and incessantly screaming"... don't make for very sympathetic victims".
Reception for "Jaws 3-D" was generally poor. "Variety" calls it "tepid" and suggests that Alves "fails to linger long enough on the Great White." It has an 11% 'rotten' rating at Rotten Tomatoes. The 3-D was criticized as being a gimmick to attract audiences to the aging series and for being ineffective. Derek Winnert says that "with Richard Matheson's name on the script you'd expect a better yarn" although he continues to say that the film "is entirely watchable with a big pack of popcorn."
"Jaws The Revenge" attracted the poorest critical reception of the series, and was nominated for Worst Picture in the 1987 Golden Raspberry Awards. It is often considered one of the worst movies ever made. It was rated by "Entertainment Weekly" as one of "The 25 Worst Sequels Ever Made". Roger Ebert said that it "is not simply a bad movie, but also a stupid and incompetent one." He lists several elements that he finds unbelievable, including that Ellen is "haunted by flashbacks to events where she was not present." Ebert also laments that Michael Caine could not attend the ceremony to collect his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor earned for "Hannah and Her Sisters" because of his shooting commitments on this film.
In an era in which documentaries were attempting responsible, accurate reporting about the natural world, ecocriticism says that Hollywood continued to produce films that exploited the fear of animals. Scholar Greg Garrard cites David Ingram's suggestion that the "Jaws" series "represents a backlash against conservationist ideas in which an 'evil, threatening nature is eventually mastered through male heroism, technology and the blood sacrifice of the wild animal'". Greg Garrard observes in "Jaws The Revenge" that "the marine biologist Mike Brody's environmentalist concerns are effectively ridiculed as his colleague is eaten by the enraged fish; he joins the hunt for it and the shark in turn hunts him down."
Unofficial sequel.
In 1995 the infamous Italian filmmaker Bruno Mattei (under the name of William Snyder) directed "Cruel Jaws" (also known as "The Beast"), a mockbuster marketed in many areas as "Jaws 5: Cruel Jaws". The movie starred Richard Dew and utilized footage from the "Jaws" series, "Deep Blood", and "The Last Shark".
Merchandise.
Universal "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" for the first film's distribution and exhibition. The studio and publisher Bantam designed a logo which would appear on both the paperback and on all film advertising. "Both publisher and distributor recognized the mutual benefits that a joint promotion strategy would bring." Producers Zanuck and Brown toured six cities to promote the paperback and the film. Once the film was released, more merchandising was created, including shark-illustrated swimming towels and T-shirts, plastic shark fins for swimmers to wear, and shark-shaped inflatables for them to float on. The Ideal Toy Company produced a game where the player had to use a hook to fish out items from the shark's mouth before the jaws closed.
"Jaws 2" inspired much more merchandising and sponsors than the first film. Products included sets of trading cards from Topps and Baker's bread, paper cups from Coca-Cola, beach towels, a souvenir program, shark tooth necklaces, coloring and activity books, and a model kit of Brody's truck. A novelization by Hank Searls, based on an earlier draft of the screenplay by Howard Sackler and Dorothy Tristan, was released, as well as Ray Loynd's "The Jaws 2 Log", an account of the film's production.
There have been two major video game releases based upon the franschise. The first, titled "Jaws", was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1987, the year that the final film in the series was released. "Jaws Unleashed", developed by Appaloosa Interactive, was released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC platforms. A new Jaws video game titled Jaws: Ultimate Predator is going to be available for the Wii and 3DS. The game will take place 35 years after the events of the first film.

Stephan Swanson came to prominence as a marine researcher when he successfully placed the satellite transmitter on the famous Great white shark Nicole, the first great white shark ever to be tracked on a 20,000 kilometer migration from South Africa to Australia and back. Due to his ability to handle large marine predators, such as the great white shark, he was contracted as an expedition biologist to travel to Guadeloupe and place satellite transmitters on the dorsal fins of Great Whites. His historical capture and release of a 5m long, 1800 kilogram great white shark is documented in the National Geographic Marine Special "Ultimate Shark".

DHR2 domain

DHR2 (DOCK homology region 2), also known as CZH2 or Docker2, is a protein domain of approximately 450-550 amino acids that is present in the DOCK family of proteins. This domain functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain for small G proteins of the Rho family. DHR2 domains bear no significant similarity to the well described DH domain (Dbl homologous domain) present in other RhoGEFs such as Vav, P-Rex and TRIO. Indeed, the most divergent mammalian DHR2 domains share only 16-17% sequence similarity.

2004 Capital One Bowl

The 2004 Capital One Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game between the Purdue Boilermakers and the Georgia Bulldogs on January 1, 2004, at the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Florida. Georgia entered the game after a disappointing loss in the SEC Championship Game, while Purdue entered as the Big Ten runner-up. 64,565 people came out to watch a rematch of the 2000 Outback Bowl, a game Georgia won in Overtime.
Georgia started quickly, scoring 24 unanswered points to begin the game. Purdue scored 10 quick points before halftime to make it 24-10. After a scoreless third quarter, the stage was set for a very exciting ending.
After scoring 14 unanswered points, Purdue's Kyle Orton tied the game with 7 minutes remaining. Purdue was out of timeouts when Mark Richt called a run on second down instead of ordering quarterback David Greene to take a knee. The coach was trying to avoid a punt with a few seconds left, but he quickly regretted his decision. Running back Kregg Lumpkin got hemmed up deep in the backfield and tried to run the other way, but Shaun Phillips stripped the ball. After a wild scramble, Niko Koutouvides recovered for Purdue at the Georgia 34. Purdue's Ben Jones then kicked a 44-yard field goal with 49 seconds remaining to keep the game going, tied at 27. 
Taking the ball first, the Bulldogs got to the 3 with the help of a pass interference penalty on Bobby Iwuchukwu, then went for it on fourth down from inside the 1. Lumpkin managed to slide through a crease for the touchdown. Purdue then received the ball with a chance to keep the game going. Georgia appeared to get the clinching stop when Kyle Orton threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-goal from the 8, but the Bulldogs were offsides. Orton's final pass was intercepted by Taylor in the end zone, setting off a wild celebration by the Georgia players.

Alice (locomotive)

Alice, a Hunslet , used to work in the Dinorwic slate quarries at Llanberis, in North Wales. Built in 1902, as Works No. 780, the locomotive was originally called ‘No. 4’. There was an earlier Alice which was built in 1889 (Works No. 492), later renamed King of the Scarlets.
The Alice Class.
There were 15 similar engines supplied between 1886 and 1932, the first of which was Velinheli (Works No. 409 of 1886), but for some reason, the Class was named after the first ‘Alice’. Over 46 years a number of changes were made to the design, some so substantial as to warrant an unofficial sub-class known as the ‘Port’ Class.
Alice no. 780.
Alice, in common with most of the class, did not have a dome but a steam chamber produced by the firebox outer shell being raised some six inches above the boiler barrel. It was not usual to fit cabs to these engines since they had to work under incline bridges and through tunnels in the quarries.
Alice spent all of its life working on various galleries at the Dinorwic slate quarry. The locomotive was in consequence rarely photographed. By the early 1960s the locomotive was out of use and was partially dismantled to provide spares for her sister locomotives at Dinorwic. She was parked looking very sorry for herself in a shed at the Australia gallery.
Restoration.
When the quarry at Dinorwic closed in 1969, Alice’s remains were still at the Australia gallery. The wheels and underparts had been salvaged and these were sold as spares for her sister locomotive Holy War.
Holy War was the last steam locomotive to work in a slate quarry, ending her working life in November 1967. Holy War was purchased, along with the spares from Alice by J. Marshfield Hutchings and went to Quainton Road, Buckinghamshire. In 1975 Holy War and the spares from Alice were purchased by the Rev. Alan Cliff, Vice-President of the Bala Lake Railway Society and brought to Llanuwchllyn, the headquarters of the Bala Lake Railway, and were leased to the railway.
In the meantime, Alice’s frames and tank were recovered and taken to the West Lancashire Light Railway at Hesketh Bank, near Preston. In 1977 these remains were acquired jointly by Alan Cliff and George Barnes, who was then the General Manager and Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Bala Lake Railway. Their acquisition meant that what remained of Alice was together again.
The Bala Lake Railway was loaned the parts of Alice and announced that it intended to rebuild the locomotive as an 0-4-2 tender locomotive. However, many other priorities made that intention impossible, although some work was done on the frames. 
In 1987, Chris Scott, then a Bala Lake Railway volunteer, bought the remains from Alan Cliff. The railway company had decided that it could not pursue the restoration, although it listed Alice as in their stock from 1977. Alan Cliff, who had been taken ill at the beginning of 1987 and forced to take early retirement, was in no position to spearhead a campaign to restore Alice, so when Scott offered to purchase Alice and seek to restore her, Alan and the Bala Lake Railway were delighted. The remains of the locomotive were later moved to Scott's garage.
Preservation.
Chris Scott was at that time a volunteer fireman on the Ffestiniog Railway, and the first outing for Alice after her long restoration was in April 1994 on that railway, initially in the yard at Boston Lodge and later along the full length of the main line up to Blaenau Ffestiniog.
On 19 June 1994 Alice arrived at the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway. Mrs Alice Hyde, whose son Bill was a driver on the Bala Lake Railway, had set up a bookstall to raise money for the locomotive’s restoration and Scott promised that when the engine ran again it should be re-dedicated to and by its namesake and benefactor. During the railway’s Steam Gala event on 10 September 1994 Mrs Hyde, who had travelled down from Bala in North Wales, re-dedicated the name of the locomotive Alice. On the following day Alice worked her first passenger train, double-headed with Barclay steam locomotive Doll. Alice was later fitted with braking equipment and operated passenger trains on its own.
Alice visited the Welsh Highland Railway on 19–20 September 1998 for the first Enthusiasts' Weekend. The loco was based at Leighton Buzzard for its first ten years of operation in preservation, following which it moved to Rheilffordd Llyn Tegid Bala Lake Railway, where it was painted black.
The locomotive later returned to the Bala Lake Railway in 2003.
In 2010 the locomotive was purchased by Julian Birley.

İzmit Clock Tower

The İzmit Clock Tower (Turkish: "İzmit Saat Kulesi") in İzmit, Turkey is one of many clock towers that were built throughout the Ottoman Empire as a result of the decree which was sent to the provincial governors to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Sultan Abdülhamid II's ascension to the Ottoman throne. It was designed by architect Vedat Tek upon the order of Musa Kazım Bey, the governor of İzmit, and built in 1901. 
The neoclassical clock tower, which stands just in front of the Hünkar Pavilion of Sultan Abdülaziz, has four floors with dimensions . The ground floor houses fountains, while the clock is on the top floor. All four facades of the middle floors are decorated with the seal of Sultan Abdülhamid II. The pointed cone on top is coated with lead.
The clock tower has been an inseparable part of the history of İzmit throughout the 20th century, and has become the symbol of the city.
In the former Balkan provinces of the Ottoman Empire, particularly in present-day Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin towns such as Belgrade, Prijepolje, Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Gradačac and Stara Varoš, similar Ottoman era clock towers are still named "Sahat Kula" (deriving from the Turkish words "Saat Kulesi", meaning "Clock Tower".)

The turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) is a species of fish in the Aplocheilidae branch of the Cyprinodontiformes order. This annual fish inhabits ephemeral pools in semi-arid areas with scarce and erratic precipitations and have adapted to the routine drying of their environment by evolving desiccation-resistant eggs that can remain dormant in the dry mud for one and maybe more years by entering into diapause. Due to very short duration of the rain season, the natural lifespan of these animals is limited to a few months and their captive lifespan is likewise short, making them an attractive model system for ageing research.

Breast Cancer Care

Breast Cancer Care is a charity in the UK that provides information, practical assistance and emotional support to anyone affected by breast cancer. The organization was founded in 1972 by Betty Westgate who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1968. The organization's headquarters are located in London, with satellite offices in Sheffield, Cardiff, and Glasgow.
History.
Breast Cancer Care was founded by Betty Westgate in 1972, four years after her own diagnosis of breast cancer in 1968. At the outset, the charity was called Cancer Education Voluntary Service; the name was later changed to Breast Care and Mastectomy Association of Great Britain in 1987 and again to Breast Cancer Care in 1994.
Betty’s passion for information, education and empowerment lead her to setting up the Mastectomy Association which she ran on a voluntary basis from her home in Croydon, South London, until March 1981. In 1981, the National Society for Cancer Relief (Now Macmillan Cancer Support) offered to fund the work of the Mastectomy Association to enable it to develop its full potential.
In 1989 the first office opened in Scotland. This was also the year of the first fashion show involving women with breast cancer as models. Cherie Booth QC became a Patron of Breast Cancer Care in 1997, followed by Geri Halliwell in 2000. In 2001, Breast Cancer Care opened its first office in the North of England with a fourth regional office opened in Wales in 2003.
Services.
Breast Cancer Care provides a range of services to support those affected by breast cancer, their friends and family. A selection of their services according to their website include a telephone support helpline, an Ask the Nurse email service and Face-to-face multiple day services designed to ‘inform, support and connect people affected by breast cancer.’
Nursing Network.
Breast Cancer Care's Nursing Network was launched as a service for healthcare professionals in 2010 and nearly 800 nurses have now joined the service.
Breast Cancer Care works closely with healthcare professionals to help ensure people affected by breast cancer get the best treatment and care available.
Breast Cancer Care Members receive support, training and information and news about Breast Cancer Care services and campaigns as well as up to date information regarding clinical developments and changes in practice. Members receive regular news updates and a magazine called Nursing Network News. They have a dedicated Helpline (telephone number 0808 800 6000) which is open to healthcare professionals in need of support or guidance.
In 2012 Breast Cancer Care hosted their first awards scheme, which recognises nurses who have gone the extra mile to make a difference with the care they offer their patients. For more information about the outstanding work represented by entries, take a look at the Nursing Network Award pages on the website.

Princess Sophie of the Netherlands

Princess Sophie of the Netherlands (Wilhelmine Marie Sophie Louise; 8 April 1824 – 23 March 1897) was the only daughter of King William II of the Netherlands and of his wife Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia. She was heir presumptive to her niece, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, for seven years, from the death of her brother until her own death.
Marriage and children.
Princess Sophie married her first cousin, Charles Alexander, Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, at Kneuterdijk Palace in The Hague on 8 October 1842. Their mothers were sisters, daughters of Tsar Paul I of Russia.
They had four children:
Catherine Radziwill, a contemporary of Sophie's, commented that,
"... was very different from her husband, and, though extremely ugly, was a most imposing Princess. She was clever, too, and upheld the reputation of the Weimar family. She was a Princess of the Netherlands by birth...and kept and maintained at her court the traditions in which she had been reared. Notwithstanding her want of beauty, moreover, she presented a splendid figure, being always magnificently dressed and covered with wonderful jewels, among which shone a parure of rubies and diamonds that were supposed to be the finest of their kind in Europe".

Shokei Matsui

, also known by his Korean name of Moon Jang Gyu (Hangul: 문장규; Hanja: 文章圭), is a master of Kyokushin karate and current "Kancho" (Director) of one faction of the International Karate Organization (IKO) founded by Mas Oyama (1923–1994).
Early life.
Matsui was born in 1963 and started training in Kyokushin karate at age 13. In 1976, he joined the Kita Nagare-Yama Dojo in Chiba Prefecture and attained the rank of 1st "dan" black belt in a little over one year. 
Later years.
Matsui completed the 100-man kumite in 1987, when ranked 4th "dan". In May 1992, Matsui opened his own "dojo" in Asakusa, Tokyo, and was later appointed as a Branch Chief by Oyama.
Near the end of his life, Oyama named Matsui (then ranked 5th "dan", and clearly junior in rank to several senior instructors) to succeed him in leading the IKO. Reportedly, a letter by senior Kyokushin instructor Peter Chong noted that Matsui was surprised to hear that he had been appointed to succeed Oyama, but also that Oyama had earlier named Matsui before several other people as the leading candidate to succeed him. Matsui then became "Kancho" (Director). Following a dispute over the veracity of Oyama's will, Kyokushin karate as an organization divided into three main groups, led by Matsui, Kenji Midori, and Yoshikazu Matsushima.
Matsui is currently ranked 8th "dan", and leads one of the IKO groups, supported by Yuzo Goda,Bijan Fard ,Bobby Lowe, Peter Chong, and Seiji Isobe. Loek Hollander had previously supported Matsui, but withdrew his support in August 2010.

History and naming of human leukocyte antigens

Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) began as a list of antigens identified as a result of transplant rejection. The antigens were initially identified by categorizing and performing massive statistical analyses on interactions between blood types. This process is based upon the principle of serotypes. HLA are not typical antigens, like those found on surface of infectious agents. HLAs are "allo"antigens, they vary from individual to individual as a result of genetic differences.
An organ called the thymus is responsible for ensuring that any t-cells that attack self proteins are not allowed to live. In essence, every individual's immune system is tuned to the specific set of HLA and self proteins produced by that individual. (For more information please see immune tolerance). Where this goes wrong is when tissues are transferred to another person. Since individuals almost always have different "banks" of HLAs, the immune system of the recipient recognizes the transplanted tissue as non-self and destroys the offending tissue. It was through the realization of this that HLAs were discovered.
Discovery.
The thought that the mammalian body must have some way of identifying introduced foreign particles first arose during World War II. Numerous theories were proposed and it wasn't until 1958 that the first of these identifying proteins was found. The first standardized naming system was established in 1968 by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System. HLA research didn't heat up until the 1980s when a group of researchers finally elucidated the shape of the HLA-A*02 protein (just one of many specific HLA proteins). Even more recently, in 2010, the WHO committee responsible for naming all HLA proteins revised their standards for naming to introduce more clarity and specificity in the naming system. It started with a plane crash in the height of the London Blitz. The pilot suffered severe burns requiring skin grafts. However, at the time skin grafts were a risky business, often being rejected for unknown reasons. The search for a reason spanned the next four decades and in some areas is still continuing today.
Identification of Non-Self.
Peter Medawar was a zoologist turned clinician, who specialized in burn trauma. A plane crash near his home changed the path of his career, turning his work with burns from mere academia to a full on quest to save lives. Medawar and a Scottish surgeon, Tom Gibson, were tasked with working the Burns Unit of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The first insight came when the pair decided to experiment, and grafted part of a wound with the patient's skin, and another part with skin from the patient's brother. Within days the skin grafts from the brother were completely destroyed. Successive skin grafts from the brother were destroyed even faster, a fact that gave them the evidence they needed to implicate the immune system. Medawar later repeated this experiment on rabbits and 625 surgeries later validated their initial conclusions. Medawar then set out in search of the reason why rabbits rejected non-self grafts.
Medawar continued his work, this time with a team of three at the University College London during the 1950s. Medawar's coworkers were Leslie Brent, a PhD student, and Rupert Billingham, Medawar's first graduate student at Oxford several years prior. Through carefully planned experimentation, the trio showed that mice exposed to cells of unrelated mice as fetuses did "not" reject skin grafts from those same mice. For this discovery, Medawar and an Australian scientist Frank Burnet earned the 1960 Nobel Prize.
Learned Self Tolerance.
Burnet, independently of Medawar, came to the conclusion that the immune system must learn to tolerate any self cells, and hypothesized that this must occur during fetal development. For this, he jointly was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1960. Burnet's work continued and in 1957 along with Niels Jerne published a paper that modified and revolutionized antibody theory. "Burnet speculated that one cell makes one particular shape of antibody and that all our antibody-making immune cells together make an unimaginably vast repertoire of 10 billion antibodies, each having a slightly different shape". Thus, whenever a non-self molecule appears in the human body, one of these antibodies will have an accurate enough shape to bind to that molecule. This idea is known as Clonal Selection Theory. At the time, many leading scientists including Linus Pauling and James Watson completely rejected the idea, but repeated experimentation intended to disprove the theory actually served to build up a large body of evidence supporting Burnet and Jerne's theory. 
The biggest weakness in Burnet's theory was that he had no explanation for how the body selected for immune cells that only identified non-self. In 1961, Jacques Miller published a paper offering an explanation. Miller was a PhD student at the Chester Beatty Research Institute in London. His discovery centered on the thymus. The thymus had long been regarded as nothing more than a repository for dead cells. Miller didn't buy this hypothesis. By removing the thymus of leukemic mice early in life, he found that the mice had a drastically weakened immune system. Taking inspiration from Medawar's skin transplant work, he performed a series of skin-graft experiments that showed that these immunocompromised mice didn't reject skin grafts from non-genetically identical mice. Miller then hypothesized that the thymus was essential in the construction and maintenance of the immune system. At this point Burnet came back into the picture, extending the hypothesis to specify that the dead cells found in the thymus are not any old immune cells, but instead the cells that are activated by self molecules. In other words, any molecule that binds to and hence "recognizes" a self molecule is killed before exiting the thymus. These cells were later found to be one of two types of immune cells, the T-cells (named for their origin, the thymus).
Identification of the first HLAs.
The discovery of the first HLA was very much a mystery. In 1958 Jean Dausset noticed that blood serum from one person could react with the white blood cells of another. He had no idea why, but he named the causative agent MAC. Around the same time other researchers were making similar discoveries. Rose Payne and Jon van Rood made an identical conclusion from observations of interactions between the blood of women who had been pregnant multiple times and the white blood cells of others. They hypothesized that this was because they had been "sensitized" (an immunological term meaning previously exposed to and thus more reactive towards) to the non-self proteins of the father through tissue damage during birth. At this point the researchers all realized that the sheer quantity of data they were capable of obtaining was vastly greater than that of any previous study and so collaboration would be essential. The first international meeting, in 1964, highlighted the difficulties of such massive collaborative work. Different experimental methods and inconsistency in the execution of the same tests and a non-homogeneity of naming systems added together to make collaboration incredibly difficult. 
World Health Organization steps in.
In 1967 the World Health Organization (WHO) decided that the HLA research needed an official naming system. This in turn would aid in organization and would more easily facilitate the unification of data being collected at numerous laboratories across the world. This committee is still in existence today and vastly accelerated the rate of HLA research. The first meeting of this committee in 1968 set forth guidelines and rules that govern HLAs. First, compatibility genes were divided into two types, class I and class II. Class I molecules were identified via reactions between blood serum and cells. Class II molecules were identified by mixtures of white blood cells. Second, the compatibility genes were renamed Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). Despite this clarification and the ever increasing number of identified HLAs, nobody knew how they worked.
MHC Restriction.
Late in 1973 a pair of researchers in Australia, Rolf Zinkernagel and Peter Doherty made a revelatory discovery that altered the thinking of immunologists forever. The pair was doing research on viral infections in mice and noticed that T-cells that prevented viral infections in some mice wouldn't always prevent the same infection in other mice. After looking at the MHCs present in the mice, they realized that cytotoxic T-cells could only identify virus infections in cells with the right Class I compatibility gene. Traditional thinking was that the immune system identified infections directly but this discovery turned that theory on its head. Compatibility genes were essential in immune system mediated viral clearing. The pair coined the term "MHC Restriction" to describe this relationship between T-cells, specific MHC proteins, and viral detection. In 1975, in an article in the journal "Lancet", they introduced the idea of "altered self", meaning that viruses alter the MHC proteins and this alteration is detected by T-cells. For their work they won the 1996 Nobel Prize. It took the work of many others to determine how T-cells made this identification.
Discovering the protein shape.
Nearly all important molecules in the body are proteins. Proteins work by each having a specific sequence of amino acids and a specific shape. Determining the order of amino acids is relatively simple. Finding the shape requires the use of x-ray crystallography and is anything but easy. It took a team of three researchers at Harvard, Don Wiley, Jack Strominger, and Pamela Bjorkman, eight years to ferret out the structure of the HLA protein. They worked specifically with HLA-A*02. Bjorkman did the majority of the leg work and in the seven years managed to piece together the structure of 90% of the protein. That last 10% was elusive though. It took another year of work to finally unveil the complete structure of HLA-A*02. They completed their work in the spring of 1987, discovering that the final 10% made a "cup" (of sorts) located on top of the molecule. It was the perfect size to hold peptides. Other researchers had previously determined that T-Cells can recognize cells infected with a virus, cells injected with a single protein from a virus, and even cells injected with pieces of protein from a virus. The discovery of the HLA protein structure made it starkly clear that the HLA proteins hold viral peptides in their binding groove. But the research team from Harvard wasn't done. They also observed that there was clearly a peptide in the binding groove of the HLA molecules they used to determine the shape. However, the cells they had extracted the protein from were definitely not infected by any disease causing viruses. The conclusion they made and the conclusion that has stuck to this day, is that HLA molecules can bind both self, and non-self peptides.
Nomenclature.
Current HLA naming system.
The most recent HLA naming system was developed in 2010 by the WHO Committee for Factors of the HLA System. There are two types of MHCs, Class I and Class II. Both are named using the same system. Currently there are 7,678 Class I alleles and 2,268 Class II alleles. 
HLA Naming can be quite confusing at first. All alleles start with "HLA", signifying they are part of the human MHC genes. The next portion (HLA-A or HLA-B) identifies which gene the allele is a modification of. The first two numbers (HLA-A*02) signifies what antigen type that particular allele is, which typically signifies the serological antigen present. In other words, HLAs with the same antigen type (HLA-A*02:101 and HLA-A*02:102) will not react with each other in serological tests. The next set of digits (HLA-A*02:101) indicates what protein the allele codes for, and these are numbered sequentially in the order they are discovered. Any HLA that has a different number here produces a different protein (AKA has a nucleotide change that replaces an amino acid with another). The third set of numbers (HLA-A*02:101:01) indicates an allele variant that has a different DNA sequence but produces the same protein as the normal gene. The final set of numbers (HLA-A*02:101:01:01) is used to designate a single or multiple nucleotide polymorphism in a non-coding region of the gene. The final aspect of HLA naming is a letter (HLA-A*02:101:01:01L). There are six letters, each with a different meaning. 
Establishing the system.
A person can have 2 antigen proteins per genetic-locus (one gene from each parent). When first discovered, identified antigens were clustered, creating groups in which no more than two antigens per cluster were found in a given person. Serotype group "A" consisted HL-A1, A2, A3, A9, A10, A11. Another cluster, "B", contained A7, A8, A12, A13, A14, A15. HL-A4 antigen was found to occur on lymphoid cells. Since the "HL-Antigens" no longer belonged to a single group, a new naming system was needed. 
In 1968 the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System first met. They established a system that divided the HLAs into HLA-A and HLA-B, A and B corresponding to a group of reactive serotypes. For example, "HL-A2" became HLA-A2, "HL-A7" became HLA-B7 and "HL-A8" became HLA-B8.
In this arrangement there were cells that were 'blank' or had new specificities, these new antigens were called "W" antigens, and as they were reassigned to new groups, for example "A" serotypes, they became Aw or Bw antigens. It was found that some antigens that behaved like A and B antigens but could be excluded based on '2-type max' exclusion. Thus a new group, "C" was created. Classification of C antigens is still ongoing, and they have retained the name Cw as many serotypes have not been developed. 
The classification of the "A4" antigens was complicated. The "A4" subset evolved to become D-region antigens, which was a large cluster of genes that encoded MHC class II. Several renamings occurred. The D-region has 8 major coding loci that combine to form 3 different protein groups; DP, DQ, and DR. DRw antigens were the first to be split, a process made easy by the virtue of having an invariant alpha chain, but complicated by 4 beta chain loci (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, and DRB5). Serotypes to DQ reacted with alpha and beta chains, or both of certain isoforms. The proper classification was greatly aided by gene sequencing and PCR. Classification and description of DP antigens is ongoing.
Genetics.
Genetic complexity typifies HLA.
The naming of human leukocyte antigens HLA "antigens" is deeply rooted in the discovery history of their serotypes and alleles. There is no doubt that HLA terminology can be bewildering, this terminology is a consequence of the complex genetics as well as the way these antigens were characterized. 
Historical perspective is important to an understanding how the HLA were systematized. In organ transplant the goal was to explain graft rejection for recipients, and of course, to prevent future rejection. From this perspective, the cause of rejections were found to be "antigens". In the same way bacterial antigens can cause inflammatory response, HLA antigens from the donor of the organ caused an inflammatory response when placed in a recipient. This is called allograft = different, graft(medical) = transplant rejection. 
To explain rejection in a nutshell, certain immune system components are highly variable, the agents are called the Major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens. MHC antigens cause rejection of improperly matched organ transplants. The variability stems from genetics. From the perspective of human evolution, why are antigens of the MHC so variable when many other human proteins lack variability? The cause of host-versus-graft-disease may actually stem from the functions of the system. 
The use of the word alloantigen actually masks the fact that HLA are infrequently autoantigens in the donor, and therefore their function is not as antigens, but something else. But the naming of these antigens is not borne out of function but the need to match organ donors with recipients.
Transplantation and transplant rejection.
In the early 1960s, some physicians began more aggressive attempts at organ transplantation. Knowing little about "compatibility factors", they attempted transplantation between humans and between non-humans and humans. Immunosuppressive drugs worked for a time, but transplanted organs would either always fail or the patients would die from infections. Patients received skin, white blood cell or kidney donations from other donors (called allografts, meaning 'of different genetics' grafts). If these allografts were rejected, it was found that the 'rejection' response was accompanied by an antibody mediated agglutination (biology) of red blood cells (See figure). The search for these cell surface antigens began. There are several processes by which antibodies can reduce function: 
Different antigens can be identified.
In the accompanying figure, two similar haplotypes (unknown to early clinicians) are identical, except for the one "antigen" in the top haplotype. The transplant may not be rejected, but if rejection does occur that allotypic protein, the allo"antigen", in the donor tissue may have induced the dominant allo-reactive antibody in the recipient.
Assaying antiserum.
Hemagglutination assay. In generating an immune response to an antigen, the B-cells go through a process of maturation, from surface IgM production, to serum IgM production, to maturation into a plasma cell producing IgG. Graft recipients who generate an immune response have both IgM and IgG. The IgM can be used directly in hemagglutination assays, depicted on the right. IgM has 10 antigen binding regions per molecule, allowing cross-linking of cells. An antiserum specific for HLA-A3 will then agglutinate HLA-A3 bearing red blood cells if the concentration of IgM in the antiserum is sufficiently high. Alternatively, a second antibody to the invariable (Fc) region of the IgG can be used to cross-link antibodies on different cells, causing agglutination. 
Complement fixation assay. The complement fixation test was modified to assay Antiserum mediated RBC lysis. 
Chromium release assay. This assay measures the release of (biological) radioactive chromium from cells as a result of killer cell activity. These cells are attracted to class I antigens that either carry foreign antigens, or are foreign to the immune system.
The role of haplotypes in identifying antigens.
Each person has two HLA haplotypes, a cassette of genes passed on from each parent. The haplotype frequencies in Europeans are in strong linkage disequilibrium. This means there are much higher frequencies of certain haplotypes relative to the expectation based on random sorting of gene-alleles. This aided the discovery of HLA antigens, but was unknown to the pioneering researchers.
In the tables a fortuitous transplant between two unrelated individual has resulted in an antiserum to single alloantigen. By discovering these close-but-non-identical matches, the process with somewhat related haplotypes surface antigens were identified for HLA A, and in the table below, HLA B at the time however these were all grouped together as HL-Antigens. On the left the "B" and "cw" antigens are matched (B and C are close together so if B matches then C likely also matches), but A antigens are not matched. The antisera that is produced by the recipient is most likely to be A3, but if the direction of transplant is reversed A2 is the likely alloantigen. Two of the first three alloantigens are thus readily easy to detect because of the similarity and frequency of the A2-B7 and A3-B7 haplotypes (see example 1). 
In these instances, the A1/A2, A2/A3, A1/A3 are matched, decreasing the probability of a rejection because many are linked to a given haplotype. Occasionally the 'recombinant' A1-Cw7-B7(rare), B7 becomes the alloantigen in a recipient with A1-Cw7-B8(common).
This linkage disequilibrium in Europeans explains why A1, A2, A3, "A7"and "A8"[B8 were identified, first. It would have taken substantially longer to identify other alleles because frequencies were lower, and haplotypes that migrated into the European population had undergone equilibration or were from multiple sources. 
This is the genetic background against which scientists tried to uncover and understand the histocompatibility antigens.
A list of antigens created.
In the late 1960s, scientist began reacting sera from patients with rejecting transplants to donor or 'third party' tissues. Their sera (the liquid part of the blood when blood clots) was sensitized to the cells from donors - it was "alloreactive". By testing different anti-sera from recipients they were able to uncover some with unique reactivities. As a result, scientists were able to identify a few antigens. At first the first antigens were called the Hu-1 antigens and tentatively tagged as gene products of the Human equivalent of the mouse histocompatibility locus (H2). In 1968, it was discovered that matching these antigens between kidney donor and recipient improved the likelihood of kidney survival in the recipient. The antigen list still exists, although it has been reorganized to fit what we have since learned about genetics, refined, and greatly expanded.
Lymphocyte bearing antigens recognized.
As the study of these 'rejection' sera and "allo"-antigens progressed, certain patterns in the antibody recognition were recognized. The first major observation, in 1969, was that an allotypic antibodies to "4" ("Four") was only found on lymphocytes, while most of the antigens, termed "LA", recognized most cells in the body. 
This group "4" antigen on lymphocytes would expand into "4a", "4b" and so on, becoming the "D" series (HLA-D (Class II) antigens) DP, DQ, and DR. This is an interesting history in itself. 
The Hu-1 antigens were renamed the Human-lymphoid (HL) allo-antigens (HL-As). Allo-antigen comes from the observation that a tolerated protein in the donor becomes antigenic in the recipient. This can be compared with an autoantigen, in which a person develops antibodies to one or more of their own proteins. This also suggested the donor and recipient have a different genetic makeup for these antigens. The "LA" group thereafter was composed of HL-A1, A2, A3, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14 and A15 until further divisions and renaming were necessary. Some of the antigens above, for example HL-A1, are similar to HLA-A1, as they are the same serotype. Some of the above, like A5, are not mentioned within the last few years, as they have been renamed.
During these early studies it became known that there were associations with many autoimmune diseases. And the HLA A1-B8 haplotype is linked to a very long piece of conserved chromosome 6 variant called AH8.1 haplotype. In these studies "HL-A1,8" were frequently found co-linked to disease. This linkage is not necessarily a function of either gene, but a consequence of the way AH8.1 evolved.
Subclassification of lymphoid antigens.
A series of tests on cultured cells revealed that, within the "LA" group, a donor tissue might have some antigens but not others. For example, an antiserum may react with patterns (on a given tissue):
But fail to react in the following patterns:
The HLA serotype series.
Series "A".
If 2 members of the series (A1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11) were typed, a reaction with a third member of the series to the donor was not observed. This 'exclusivity' identified series "A". One might notice the similarities of this numeric series with the , as series "A" antigens are the first six members of HLA-A. Inadvertently, the scientist had discovered an antibody set that recognized only gene products from one locus, HLA-A gene the "antigens" being the gene products. The implication is that an alloreactive anti-sera can be a tool for genetic identification.
Series "B".
Not long after the series A antigens were separated from the (rapidly expanding) list of antigens, it was determined another group also could be separated along the same "logical" lines. This group included HL-A5, A7, A8, A12. This became the series "B".
Note the similarity of Series "B" to the first few members . The names of these antigens were necessarily changed to fit the new putative series they were assigned to. From HL-A# to HLA-B#. The problem was that the literature was using "A7" and would soon be using "B7" as shorthand for HLA-B7.
Pseudo-series "w".
Since it was now certain, by the early 1970s, that the "antigens" were encoded by different series, implicit loci, numeric lists became somewhat cumbersome. Many groups were discovering antigens. In these instances an antigen was assigned a temporary name, like "RoMa2" and after discussion, the next open numeric slot could be assigned, but not to an "A" or "B" series until proper testing had been done. To work around this problem a 'workshop' number "w#" was often assigned while testing continued to determine which series the antigen belonged to.
Series "C".
Before too long, a series "C" was uncovered. Series C has proved difficult to serotype, and the alleles in the series still carry the "w" tag signifying that status; in addition, it reminds us that Series C were not assigned names the same way as Series A and B, it has its own numeric list Cw1, Cw2, Cw3.
Serotype group expansion and refinement.
By the mid 1970s, genetic research was finally beginning to make sense of the simple list of antigens, a new series "C" had been discovered and, in turn genetic research had determined the order of HLA-A, C, B and D encoding loci on the human 6p. With new series came new antigens; Cw1 and 2 were quickly populated, although Cw typing lagged. Almost half of the antigens could not be resolved by serotyping in the early 90s. Currently genetics defines 18 groups. 
At this point, Dw was still being used to identify DR, DQ, and DP antigens. The ability to identify new antigens far exceeded the ability to characterize those new antigens. 
As technology for transplantation was deployed around the world, it became clear that these antigens were far from a complete set, and in fact hardly useful in some areas of the world (e.g., Africa, or those descended from Africans). Some serotyping antibodies proved to be poor, with broad specificities, and new serotypes were found that identified a smaller set of antigens more precisely. These broad antigen groups, like A9 and B5, were subdivided into "split" antigen groups, A23 & A24 and B51 & B52, respectively. As the HL-A serotyping developed, so did identification of new antigens.
Genetic identification.
In the early 1980s, it was discovered that a restriction fragment segregates with individuals who bear the HLA-B8 serotype. By 1990, it was discovered that a single amino acid sequence difference between HLA-B44 (B*4401 versus B*4402) could result in allograft rejection. This revelation appeared to make serotyping based matching strategies problematic if many such differences existed. In the case of B44, the antigen had already been split from the B12 broad antigen group. In 1983, the cDNA sequences of HLA-A3 and Cw3 All three sequences compared well with mouse MHC class I antigens. The Western European HLA-B7 antigen had been sequenced (although the first sequence had errors and was replaced). In short order, many HLA class I alleles were sequenced
including 2 Cw1 alleles.
By 1990, the full complexity of the HLA class I antigens was beginning to be understood. At the time new serotypes were being determined, the problem with multiple alleles for each serotype was becoming apparent by nucleotide sequencing. RFLP analysis helped determine new alleles, but sequencing was more thorough. Throughout the 1990s, PCR kits, called SSP-PCR kits were developed that allowed, at least under optimal conditions, the purification of DNA, PCR and Agarose Gel identification of alleles within an 8 hour day. Alleles that could not be clearly identified by serotype and PCR could be sequenced, allowing for the refinement of new PCR kits.
Serotypes like B*4401, B*4402, B*4403, each abundant within those with B44 serotypes could be determined with unambiguous accuracy. The molecular genetics has advanced HLA technology markedly over serotyping technology, but serotyping still survives. Serotyping had identified the most similar antigens that now form the HLA subgroups. Serotyping can reveal whether an antigen coded by the relevant HLA gene is expressed. An HLA allele coding non-expressed gene is termed "Null Allele", for example: HLA-B*15:01:01:02N. The expression level can also detected by serotyping, an HLA gene coding for antigens which has low protein expression on the cell surface is termed "Low Rxpresser", for example: HLA-A*02:01:01:02L.
Summary.
The scientific problem has been to explain the natural function of a molecule, such as a self cell-surface receptor involved in immunity. It also seeks to explain how variation developed (perhaps by evolutionary pressure), and how the genetic mechanisms works (dominant, codominant, semidominant, or recessive; purifying selection or balancing selection).

Dod Procter

Dod Procter RA (born Doris Margaret Shaw, 1890–1972) was an English artist, and wife of artist Ernest Procter. Her painting, "Morning", was bought for public consumption by the "Daily Mail" in 1927.
Procter and her husband attended art schools in England and in Paris together, where they were both influenced by Impressionism and Post-Impressionism movements. They also worked together at times, sometimes sharing commissions and other times showing their work together in exhibitions. Procter was a lifelong artist, active after the untimely death of her husband in 1935. She was a member of several artists organizations, such as the Newlyn School and became President of St Ives Society of Artists (STISA) in 1966. Her work was exhibited at the Royal Academy on many occasions.
Personal life and education.
Doris "Dod" Shaw was born in Hampstead, London in 1890. At the age of 15 she moved to Newlyn with her mother and brother so that she could study at the Forbes School. The Shaws stayed with two other Forbes students, Dod's cousin Cicely Jesse and another woman artist, Tennyson Jesse, at Myrtle Cottage. At Forbes Miss Shaw met her future husband Ernest Procter; They were "were amongst the Forbes' star pupils." 
In 1910 and 1911 Dod Shaw and Ernest Procter studied in Paris at Atelier Colarossi. Dod and Ernest were both influenced by Impressionism and Post-impressionism and the artists that they met in France, such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne. In 1912 the couple married at Paul Church. One year later their son Bill was born. 
They stayed in Paris until 1918, during the war Ernest served in France working for the Friends' Ambulance Service. Newlyn was Proctor's home for most of her working life. Ernest's died unexpectedly while travelling in 1935. Three years later Dod moved to be closer to her friend Althea Garstin. After Ernest's death, Procter travelled to the United States, Canada, Jamaica and Africa. She died in 1972 and is buried next to her husband at St Hilary Church.
Career.
After the war, Dod and Ernest Procter returned to Newlyn. Dod and Ernest accepted a commission to decorate the Kokine Palace in 1919 and 1920. The Procters created designs for etched crystal. From around 1922, Proctor painted a series of simplified, monumental images of young women of her acquaintance. They were typified by the volume of the figures, brought out by her use of light and shadow.
When her painting, "Morning", in this series, was displayed at the 1927 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, it was voted Picture of the Year and bought by the Daily Mail for the Tate gallery, where it now hangs. Proctor sold the work for £300, but could have achieved ten times that amount. Prior to its permanent home in the Tate, its popularity resulted in its showing in New York, and then a two year tour of Britain.
Both public and critics responded to its "sensuous but sombre style" which evoked the west Cornish "silver light". Frank Rutter, art critic of "The Sunday Times", said in 1927 that "Morning" was "a new vision of the human figure which amounts to the invention of a twentieth century style in portraiture" and "She has achieved apparently with consummate ease that complete presentation of twentieth century vision in terms of plastic design after which Derain and other much praised French painters have been groping for years past." The model for the work was a Newlyn fisherman's 16 year old daughter, Cissie Barnes.
The subjects of her pictures are largely portraits and flowers. Althea Garstin's influence was realized in Procter's work in the latter part of her career. She became a full member of the Royal Academy in 1942. Three years later she illustrated "A Penny for a Guy" for Clare Collas. During her travels to Jamaica in the 1950s she painted made several works of children. 
During her lifetime and after her death her work fell out of favour.

List of Choctaw chiefs

List of Choctaw chiefs is a record of the political leaders who served the Choctaws in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.
Original three divisions.
The eastern Choctaw Nation, in what is now Mississippi and Alabama, was divided into three regions: Okla Hannali, Okla Falaya, and Okla Tannip.
District Chiefs in the New Indian Territory.
After removal, the Choctaws set up their government also divided up in three regions: Apukshunnubbee, Mushulatubbee, and Pushmataha. The regions were named after the three influential Choctaw leaders of the "old country."
Provisional Chiefs.
The Choctaw Nation was temporarily discontinued in 1906 with the advent of Oklahoma statehood.
Choctaw Nation "token" government.
Chiefs were appointed by the U.S. President after dissolution of the Choctaw nation.
Current tribes.
Indian termination policy was a policy that the United States Congress legislated in 1953 to assimilate the Native American communities with mainstream America. In 1959, the Choctaw Termination Act was passed. Unless repealed by the federal government, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma would effectively be terminated as a sovereign nation as of August 25, 1970. 
In 1945, lands in Neshoba County, Mississippi and the surrounding counties were set aside as a federal Indian reservation. There are eight communities of reservation land: Bogue Chitto, Bogue Homa, Conehatta, Crystal Ridge, Pearl River, Red Water, Tucker, and Standing Pine. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 allowed the Mississippi Choctaws to become re-organized on April 20, 1945 as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.

Uchiko Line

The is a short railway line stretching from in Uchiko, Kita District to in Ōzu, entirely in Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku, Japan, and operated by the Shikoku Railway Company (JR Shikoku). The line operationally acts as part of the Yosan Line, to which it connects at both ends.
Services.
The line is served by Limited Express trains between Okayama ("Shiokaze" trains, one round-trip a day), Takamatsu ("Ishizuchi" trains, two Takamatsu-bound trains a day) or Matsuyama ("Uwakai" trains, 14 return trips and two Uwajima-bound trains a day) and Uwajima, and Local trains between Matsuyama or Iyoshi and Iyo-Ōzu, Yawatahama or Uwajima.
Stations.
All trains run through at both ends: from Uchiko trains run through to at least Iyoshi station, and from Niiya trains run to at least Iyo-Ōzu.
History.
The line was originally built by the as a light railway line stretching from , where the line split off the main line from Nagahama-machi (the present Iyo-Nagahama) to Ōzu (the present Iyo-Ōzu), to Uchiko, opening on May 1, 1920. On October 1, 1933, it (along with the Ehime Railway Main Line) was nationalised and the name was assigned to both lines; both lines were regauged to , the national standard, on October 6, 1935, the same day when the Ehime Line was incorporated into the Yosan Main Line. That day, the line from Gorō to Uchiko gained its own identity as the Uchiko Line. Freight operations ceased on December 1, 1971. 
On November 25, 1985, the line was closed and replaced by buses to allow heavier rails to be laid, the railbed to be strengthened, and curves to be relaxed. The next year, on March 3, the line between Uchiko and Niiya, together with new branches of the Yosan Main Line from Mukaibara and Niiya to Iyo-Ōzu, opened as a shortcut route between Matsuyama and Uwajima, with new passing facilities at Niiya, relocated stations at Uchiko and Ikazaki, and Centralised Traffic Control. The line from Niiya to Gorō was abolished. The next year, on April 1, JNR was divided and privatised, and the Uchiko Line came under the control of Shikoku Railway Company, with Japan Freight Railway Company operating services on the line. JR Freight subsequently ceased to run services on the line on April 1, 2006.

The park’s wave pool, Calypso Palace, is a concrete pool, one of the largest in North America (It is the equivalent of 3 official NHL hockey rinks). There are 35 waterslides, including long extreme slides and a jungle river ride. 
The park employs over 500 seasonal employees and is able to accommodate 12,000 visitors per day, and will be able to accommodate even more people with numerous new slides being built. The water temperature is kept at and is filtered every 90 minutes. The park consumes 2500 kW of power.
Calypso Theme Waterpark also includes several food outlets, shops, locker and changing areas, as well as picnic areas for individuals and groups. Electronic fingerprinting allows visitors to make purchases without the need to carry money or cards.
As of June 1st 2011, Calypso is home to the tallest free-standing waterslide tower in North America, standing at and including 10 new waterslides. The new Summit Tower contains roller-coaster like slides. The same tower also includes new slides for families.
All the parks attractions were provided by WhiteWater West.
Rough Opening.
Calypso experienced certain setbacks during its opening months. The heavily promoted fingerprint payment system had failed to function as planned, and on the first +30 degree day of the season the park experienced a four kilometre long line of cars trying to enter the park. A traffic light has since been installed to aid with the added traffic.
2013 new attraction.
In 2013, Calypso Park will get a second thematic lazy river, Kongo. The total cost of the ride will be $6 million.

2000–01 Australian region cyclone season

The 2000–01 Australian region cyclone season was an event in the ongoing cycle of tropical cyclone formation. It began on 1 November 2000 and ended on 30 April 2001. The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a "tropical cyclone year" separately from a "tropical cyclone season", which runs from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
Tropical cyclones in this area are monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs): the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane; and TCWC Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.
__TOC__
Storms.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Sam.
Sam originated from a tropical low that formed in the Arafura Sea on 28 November. Tracking generally westward, the initial low-pressure area remained generally weak until it entered the Timor Sea, by which time it had strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 5 December. Though a subtropical ridge was forcing the cyclone westward at the time, an approaching shortwave trough caused Sam to track southward the following day, towards the Australian coast. During its southward progression, Sam rapidly intensified, and reached its peak intensity on 7 December. The next day, the storm made landfall near Lagrange, Western Australia at the same intensity. Once inland, Sam was slow to weaken as it recurved eastward, and persisted for nearly a week inland before dissipating on 14 December.
Throughout its existence, Cyclone Sam brought heavy rainfall to a wide swath of northern Australia. Rainfall peaked at in Shelamar over a 48-hour period ending on 11 December. Upon making landfall, damage was considerable, albeit localized. Most of the destruction wrought by Sam occurred near the coast, particularly in Bidyadanga and Anna Springs Station. Some buildings sustained considerable damage, and trees and power lines were felled, resulting in some power outages. Offshore, 163 illegal immigrants aboard two vessels were feared to have drowned, which would make Sam one of the deadliest cyclones in Australian history. However, these people were later accounted for.
Tropical Cyclone Terri.
Terri formed on 27 January 2001 near the northern Kimberley coast. The storm paralleled the coast, reaching Category 2 strength before making landfall near Pardoo early on 31 January. The storm dissipated Late on the same day.
Tropical Cyclone Winsome.
Winsome was a weak system that developed from a low in the Gulf of Carpentaria on 8 February.
Torrential rains produced by the storm in the Northern Territory resulted in severe flooding which killed two people.
Tropical Cyclone Vincent.
Cyclone Vincent formed on 7 February 2001, 900 km northwest of Onslow, Western Australia from an active monsoonal trough. Wind shear prevented the tropical low from intensifying for a few days, but once the storm formed it began to move southeast and intensify. Soon it intensified into a Category 2 cyclone. Wind shear soon became stronger and Cyclone Vincent weakened to a Category 1 cyclone. Cyclone Vincent crossed the Western Australia coast as a tropical low, a few km south of Broome, Western Australia.
Tropical Cyclone Wylva.
Tropical Cyclone Wylva hit the coast of Australia in February 2001. Although it was a weak Category 1 cyclone when it peaked in strength, it caused heavy damage when it made landfall. Heavy rain produced a record-breaking flood, which washed down the Victoria River. Damages were worth $13 million and 700 people were evacuated from the dangerous flood waters.
Tropical Low (10P).
This storm moved from Brisbane's area of responsibility into Fiji's on 16 February. It dissipated on the 18th.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Abigail.
On 24 February 2001, Cyclone Abigail formed about 80 km northeast of Cairns, Australia. It then made landfall in Queensland as a Category 1 storm. 
Severe Tropical Cyclone Walter.
Walter was a storm that formed east of Christmas Island and tracked westward at a low latitude.
On 3 April, Cocos Island was placed under a cyclone watch as Walter approached the island. Throughout 5 April, heavy rains and high winds, estimated up to battered the area as Walter bypassed the island.
Tropical Cyclone Alistair.
The second most damaging cyclone of the 2000-01 Cyclone season, Alistair made landfall close to Carnarvon on 24 April 2001 as a poorly organized cyclone. The centre passed just to the north of town with a wind gust to 67 kilometres per hour from the northeast recorded at 4:11 am. Minimum pressure of 1002.9 hPa was recorded at 5 am, followed by the peak recorded wind gust of 90 kilometres per hour from the southeast at 6 am. A total of 24 mm of rainfall was reported in Carnarvon. Plantations to the north of Carnarvon reported 30-40% crop losses, with wind estimates of 100 to 110 kilometres per hour.

Soil moisture sensor

Soil moisture sensors measure the water content in soil. A soil moisture probe is made up of multiple soil moisture sensors. 
Technologies commonly used in soil moisture sensors include:
Agriculture.
Measuring soil moisture is important in agriculture to help farmers manage their irrigation systems more efficiently. Not only are farmers able to generally use less water to grow a crop, they are able to increase yields and the quality of the crop by better management of soil moisture during critical plant growth stages.
Besides agriculture, there are many other disciplines using soil moisture sensors. Golf courses are now using sensors to increase the efficiencies of their irrigation systems to prevent over watering and leaching of fertilizers and other chemicals offsite.
Landscape irrigation.
In urban and suburban areas, landscapes and residential lawns are using soil moisture sensors to interface with an irrigation controller. Connecting a soil moisture sensor to a simple irrigation clock will convert it into a "smart" irrigation controller that prevents an irrigation cycle when the soil is wet.

St. Mary's Church (Rochester, New York)

St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church and Rectory are located in downtown Rochester, New York. 
St. Mary's Parish was created in 1834 as Rochester's second Roman Catholic parish, after St. Patrick's Parish.
The cornerstone of the church was blessed 18 September 1853 by Bishop of Buffalo John Timon (the Diocese of Rochester was not formed until 1868). The building was dedicated, with Timon presiding, on 24 October 1858. The architect of the church is unknown, but design influences of Richard Upjohn and other church architects are apparent.
A brick rectory was built in 1905, replacing an earlier rectory.
A spire and bell tower, designed by Richard B. Arnold were added in 1939-1940. The north tower may have been intended to have a spire originally, but financial difficulties may have precluded adding it earlier.
The church and rectory were added to the National Register of Historic Places on 12 March 1992.

Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Spokane, Washington)

The Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Rockwood, Spokane, Washington, is the cathedral church of the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane. Three Spokane parishes, All Saints Cathedral, St. Peter's, and St. James, merged on October 20, 1929 to form the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist. Construction began on the present cathedral four year previous in 1925 and was structurally completed in less than a generation under the supervision of founding architect Harold C. Whitehouse of the Spokane firm of Whitehouse & Price. Built entirely of cut stone, the carvings, and the figures in stained glass, include symbols of many faiths. Especially notable are carvings by Ole Sunde of Seattle and by Arcangelo Cascieri and Adio diBaccari of Boston, Mass. The stained glass windows, in classic Gothic style, are the work of the Charles J. Connick firm, and since its closure of the work of Willet Hauser Architectural Glass.
The Cathedral Organ, with 4,039 pipes, designed, built and installed in 1957 by the Aeolian-Skinner Company (Opus 1343) to interpret the whole range of organ literature and renovated in 2000 by Marceau & Associates, is so skillfully voiced that even the smallest pipes can be heard in every corner of the building. Recitals are scheduled throughout the year.
Bishop Cross Tower, named to honor the Cathedral's founder, houses a 49-bell carillon, one of only a handful in the Northwest, cast and installed by the English firm of John Taylor & Sons. Carillon concerts are played following Sunday services, at times of religious and civic festivals, and other times as announced. Every July carillonneurs from all over the world come to play weekly concerts. The carillon is best heard from outside on the Cathedral Close (nearby grounds).
The Cathedral is open from 8:30 to 4:30 weekdays (except holidays) and 8:00 to 2:00 on weekends. Tour guides are available 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays and for one hour following the principal service on Sundays.

<doc id="18877738" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18877738" title="Tire-derived fuel">
Tire-derived fuel

Tire-derived fuel is composed of shredded tires. Tires may be mixed with coal or other fuels such as wood to be burned in concrete kilns, power plants, or paper mills. An EPA test program concluded that, with the exception of zinc
emissions, potential emissions from TDF are not expected to be very much different from
from other conventional fossil fuels, as long as combustion occurs in a well-designed, well-operated
and well-maintained combustion device.
Theory.
Historically, there has not been any volume use for scrap tires other than burning that has been able to keep up with the volume of waste generated yearly. Tires produce the same energy as petroleum and approximately 25% more energy than coal, Burning tires is lower on the hierarchy of reducing waste than recycling, but it is better than placing the tire waste in a landfill or dump. There is a possibility for tire fires or the harboring of disease vectors such as mosquitoes.
Tire Derived Fuel is an interim solution to the scrap tire waste problem. Advances in tire recycling technology might one day provide a solution other than burning by reusing tire derived material in high volume applications.
Characteristics.
Tire derived fuel is usually consumed in the form of shredded or chipped material with most of the metal wire from the tire's steel belts removed. The analytical properties of this refined material are published in TDF Produced From Scrap Tires with 96+% Wire Removed
This fuel has a very high energy content, with an average heat value of 15,500 BTUs per pound of fuel. This is roughly the same as heavy petroleum fuel oils. Fuel begins to burn (flash point) at 550 to 650 degrees Fahrenheit. Complete combustion is achieved with flame temperatures of 1,202 degrees Fahrenheit.
Environmental concerns about this fuel focus on the chemical contents of the tire other than hydrocarbons. Tires are constructed with steel belts which give shape and structure to the tread and sometimes to the sidewall. Much of this wire is removed when tires are shredded to make TDF, however certainly not all of it will be removed. Therefore it is no surprise that the ash contains a large mass percentage of iron. Zinc, chromium, cadmium and lead make up the bulk of the remaining heavy metals in the ash. The alkaline earth metal calcium is also present in significant quantity. Fluorine, chlorine, sulfur, and nitrogen make up the bulk of the non-metal content of the ash.
One tire manufacturing process involves a salt bath, which likely explains the high content of calcium. Trace heavy metals may be explained by metals added for alloying purposes to the steel wire in the belts.
Tires are typically composed of about 1 to 1.5% Zinc oxide, which is a well known component used in the manufacture of tires and is also toxic to aquatic and plant life. The chlorine content in tires is due primarily to the chlorinated butyl rubber liner that slows the leak rate of air. The Rubber Manufactures Association (RMA) is a very good source for compositional data and other information on tires.
The use of TDF for heat production is controversial due to the possibility for toxin production. Reportedly, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans are produced during the combustion process and there is supportive evidence to suggest that this is true under some incineration conditions. Other toxins such as NOx, SOx and heavy metals are also produced, though whether these levels of toxins are higher or lower than conventional coal and oil fired incinerators is not clear.
On one hand, some argue that it is better to use the energy stored in a tire than to put it in a landfill, in line with the waste hierarchy. On the other, it is difficult to justify introducing toxins into the atmosphere, and much energy can be saved by recycling the tires so that new ones do not need to be remanufactured from raw materials.
Controversy.
While environmental controversy surrounding use of this fuel is wide and varied, the greatest supported evidence of toxicity comes from the presence of dioxins and furans in the flue gases. Zinc has also been found to leach into storm water, from shredded rubber, at acutely toxic levels for aquatic life and plants.
A study of dioxin and furan content of stack gasses at a variety of cement mills, paper mills, boilers, and power plants conducted in the 1990s shows a wide and inconsistent variation in dioxin and furan output when fueled partially by TDF as compared to the same facilities powered by only coal. Some facilities added as little as 4% TDF and experienced as much as a 4,140% increase in dioxin and furan emsissions. Other facilities added as much as 30% TDF and experienced dioxin and furan emissions increases of only as much as 58%. Still other facilities used as much as 8% TDF and experienced a decrease of as much as 83% of dioxin and furan emissions. One facility conducted four tests with two tests resulting in decreased emissions and two resulting in increased emissions. Another facility also conducted four tests and had widely varying increases in emissions.
A 2004 study of Tire rubber use in energy generation, deeply studies the environmental impact on soil, water, and air from combustion of waste rubber (TDF).
Alvarez research shows that huge polyaromatic emissions are generated from combustion of tire rubber, at a minimum, 2 orders of magnitude higher than coal alone.
The study concludes with, "atmospheric contamination dramatically increases when tire rubber is used as the fuel.

The Sony Ericsson W902 is a mobile phone and part of the Walkman series of phones. It was announced in July 2008 and released in October 2008. The W902 is a higher end Walkman phone, featuring not only the latest state of the art Walkman 3.0 player, but also a 5.0 mega pixel camera with autofocus and flash, similar to that of many Cyber-Shot range phones, leading to some nicknaming this model 'Cyber-Walkman-Shot'.
The W902 also features a series of buttons down the side so that control of music is easily accessible. Auto-rotate means that the media player will switch to landscape mode if the phone is held on its side. This also applies to the web browser. The W902 also features shake control, meaning the music can be changed with 'the flick of a wrist', as can the volume of the music.
As of early 2009, the W902 has not been well publicised, and as such, there are fewer of them around, meaning they have maintained their value exceptionally well.

Kilmeadan

Kilmeadan or Kilmeaden (Irish: "Cill Mhíodáin") is a village in County Waterford, Ireland. It is on the N25 road between Dungarvan, County Waterford and Waterford City. The town is 23 miles from Dungarvan and 5 miles from Waterford.
Kilmeadan shares its name with a world famous cheese brand that was, until 2005, produced in a factory in the heart of the village.
Kilmeadan is also the site of St. Mary's Church, a Church of Ireland Chapel, located in the north-western part of the village, Old Kilmeaden, near the railway station, at the R680 road towards Carrick-On-Suir. 
The school serving the Kilmeadan area is found in Ballyduff, a neighbouring village, which is also home to the Catholic Church of the area, St. Nicholas' Church. Both the GAA and soccer teams of the area are also named Ballyduff Lower GAA and Ballyduff AFC respectively.
Transport.
Kilmeadan, lying in a linear pattern along the R680 (former N25 section), was in the last century home to a train station on the line from Waterford City to Mallow Junction in County Cork. In recent years, a section of the line has been reopened as a tourist line, known as The Waterford & Suir Valley Railway. 
As part of the new Waterford City bypass, Kilmeadan is now bypassed by a dual-carriageway section of the N25. This brings great relief to the previously overcrowded road through the village, now reclassified as R680.
Industry.
Throughout much of the twentieth century, Kilmeadan was also home to a very successful co-operative. The farmers of the area benefited greatly from the sale of their produce (mostly butter and milk) to the co-op, and as it expanded, a general store was opened in May 1920, which is still present today as a Centra outlet. 
In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated, and was registered as Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a cheese factory on a green field site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese was to become one of the most recognised and successful cheddar brands in the world. This is evident as the brand won a gold and bronze medal in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005. However, production of the cheese ceased at the Kilmeadan plant in 2005, and the production of Kilmeadan Cheese moved to Ballyragget, County Kilkenny. 
Kilmeadan is also the site of the East Waterford Water Treatment Plant. This plant, which is quite large, is operated by Waterford County Council and provides water mainly for Waterford City and the surrounding areas. 
The area also has a small retail outlet in the Kilmeadan Village Centre, located directly on the R680 in the village. This building provides space for shops (details in facilities below) and also a few apartments for rent.
Attractions.
The world famous Mount Congreve estate lies just outside the village, on the Old Kilmeadan Road. Owned and run by the late Mr. Ambrose Congreve (1907–2011), Mount Congreve is famous the world over for its rare species of plants and also its plant nurseries. It consists of around seventy acres of intensively planted woodland garden and a four acre walled garden. In addition there are an 18th-century house (the ancestral home of Mr. Congreve), ranges of glashouses, more than 16 miles of paths and a wholesale nursery. After Mr. Congreves death the Mount Congreve estate was left to the Irish State. Whilst the gardens are open to the public, the house is not as yet.
Kilmeadan is also home to Cullinagh Stables, a livery yard and working farm located on the banks of the River Dawn. Equipped with a cross country course, riverside treks and an art studio, the farm is also bordered by the historical remains of Fairbrook Mills and the Mill Street (former home to mill workers and their families). The art gallery is open to the public. http://cullinagh.blogspot.ie/
Also on the banks of the River Dawn lies Fairbrook House and Gardens. Seven acres of a former woollen mill have been changed into a romantic walled garden by the Dutch artists Wout Muller and Clary Mastenbroek. Established in 1994 and it has evolved over the years. Stones from former buildings have been recycled into walls, raised borders, obelisks and magic standing stones. From May 2003 the small gallery has been extended as a museum, for contemporary figurative art.

Neil Cottrill

Neil Cottrill was born in Manchester in 1971. He started playing badminton as a 10 year old and subsequently won a string of English National junior titles, winning the boys doubles at U12, U14, U16 & U18 and the mixed doubles at U14 & U18.
Neil represented England at all age groups in events around Europe as a junior, winning the boys doubles in the U16 6 nations, Dutch junior, Danish Junior and won a bronze medal in the U18 European Junior (as an U17).
Unfortunately his partner, John Quinn suffered a long term knee injury during the U18 season, leaving him without a regular partner for 2 years.
Once John recovered, the pair quickly became one of the top pairs in the UK, winning numerous county events, Friends Provident Grand Slam Series events and reaching the National Men's Doubles final, losing to Chris Hunt & Simon Archer.
Neil & John then went on the European Badminton Union circuit, where they were Czech Open champions. They soon progressed onto the World Grand Prix circuit, competing all round the world achieving a highest IBF men's doubles ranking of #12 in 1996.
The pair were in the GB Olympic squad and set for Olympic qualification for the Atlanta Games in 1996, but Neil was hit with a virus linked to overtraining which left him unable to train or compete for the 6 months prior to the games, leaving their participation impossible.
Neil retired from full-time badminton in August 1996 and became a lecturer in Sport & Exercise Science in North Wales. He also started a sports science support and coaching business in 1996 where he has worked with a number of athletes from different sports, improving their fitness and dietary practice.
The Welsh Badminton Union secured Neil's services to head up their High Performance Centre in North Wales and after working for the WBU for a few years, Neil teamed up with then National Coach Chris Rees in the men's doubles at the Welsh Nationals, where they won the event from 1999-2002. Neil also won the mixed doubles with Jo Muggeridge on 2 occasions.
Following this return to performance badminton, Neil represented the Welsh team at World and European team competition with his last appearance being at the 2002 Commonwealth games in his home city of Manchester.
Neil still works with performance badminton players in North Wales and is a lecturer in Sport & Exercise Science at Coleg Llandrillo. He has an MSc in Exercise & Nutrition Science and specialises in Dietary Analysis and Training and Recovery.

History.
In 1836, Mikhail Yuriyevich Lermontov visited Qusar, where he met with Haji Ali-efendi – a scientist-philosopher and there he heard “Ashiq Qarib” dastan from an eminent ahiq Lazgi Ahmad and after he wrote his famous work “Ashiq Qarib” based on its motifs.

In 1938, Qusar settlement acquired a city status.
Etymology.
There exist many versions about origination of the city, but the most possible one is a version of Tamilla Khalilova – Candidate of History. Since the 7th century, conquest of the South Caucasus by Arabs began. According to historical data the Arabs reached a territory of present Qusar Rayon. According to the historians version name of the river is originated from Arabian Al-Qausar. In translation from the Quran into English “Al_Qausar – in translation means a river of abundance, that is a heaven river, water of which is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its fragrance is nicer than musk and birds with beautiful long necks like necks of camels fly around it.” The settlement got its name from the river – Qusar. Modern historians believe that the name Qusar derives from "khisar".
Geography and climate.
Qusar is located in a zone of subtropical climate and the northern part of the rayon is in zone of mild climate. But because of the heights above the sea level and proximity of the mountains winter is always cold here, and summer is not hot. Temperature of air can change more than 15 degrees during a day. For instance, in summer incessant days-long rains can begin after hot weather.
The city is located not far from Bazarduzu, Shahdagh Mountains and a border with Russia. The mountain river Qusarchay, in honor of which the city acquired its name, flows in Qusar. There is also is an artificial lake - Violet.

In 1998, the State Drama Theatre of Lezghins was opened in Qusar.
In 2008, 6 secondary schools, one of which is functioning in Azerbaijani and 5 in Russian languages, were functioned in the city. There are also two preschool education institutions in the city. There is also Azerbaijan State Pedagogical College, where study future teachers of Azerbaijani, English languages and literature, and also teachers of elementary classes.
Population.
According to “The Caucasian calendar” of 1916, there lived 1203 people, generally the Russians, in the territory of Qusar. In 1926, in Qusar lived 120 highland Jews, bit in 1939 – 241 Jews.
According to a census of 1959, more than 7366 people lived in Qusar. According to a census of 1979, population of the city consisted of 12225 people, but in 1989 it reached 14230.
97% of the population consists of Lezghins.

Showcase TV

Showcase TV was a television channel in the United Kingdom that replaced AnimeCentral on 27 August 2008. It showed a mixture of different content from other CSC Media Group channels such as Pop Girl, Chart Show TV, True Movies 2 and had retained some AnimeCentral programming, in its own block between 04:00 and 06:00 with repeats of "Cowboy Bebop" and "". Its licence first appeared on the Ofcom website in January 2007 (initially named Toon TV, this was changed to AnimeCentral in June 2007, to True Entertainment in June 2008 and to Showcase TV on August 26, 2008).
Launch.
Showcase TV officially started at 06:00 on 27 August 2008. It did not receive an official launch but instead, went from AnimeCentral to Pop Girl program block straight away.
Showcase TV lineup.
The original launch lineup for Showcase TV was a Pop Girl simulcast from 6am to 4pm, a Chart Show TV simulcast from 4pm to 8pm, a True Movies 2 simulcast from 8pm to 12am (two movies) and an AnimeCentral block from 12am to 3am, with the airtime from 3am to 6am sold for teleshopping. 
This later changed; the teleshopping block was dropped, and the anime block was shortened and moved to 4am, such that the True Movies 2 section could extend to carry four movies between 8pm and 4am. At this point the simulcast of Pop Girl was replaced with a simulcast of Kix!. This new lineup then remained in place until the True Entertainment relaunch.
True Entertainment.
Showcase TV was replaced with True Entertainment. The rebranding was scheduled for 1 July 2009, but was later put "on hold until further notice". The change eventually took place a month later, on 3 August 2009. From that date, simulcasting of content from other CSC channels ceased, and True Entertainment launched its own schedule.

Karl Kani

Karl Kani (born Carl Williams in 1968, Brooklyn, New York City) is the fashion designer, founder and CEO of the Hip Hop fashion brand Karl Kani. Karl Kani was launched in 1989 as a fashion forward and Hip Hop influenced clothing line. Inspired by his passion for Hip hop music and fashion, Karl designed clothes that appealed to a large public, including friends and celebrities from his hometown Brooklyn, New York.
History.
At age 16, Carl Williams started designing clothes after learning the essential handcraft at his father's company. Karl never studied tailoring or design, but he had flair for coming up with unusual, stylish concepts. He would buy material and tell a tailor exactly how he wanted his garments to look. "For a relatively small sum", as he put it, "I had a fresh outfit that nobody had."
Karl's customized outfits were so "fresh" that soon they were in demand. After seeing him on the scene in local clubs, men started asking for a Carl Williams' outfit of their own. Soon Karl was taking his first orders in his car. The death of one of his close friends inspired some deep contemplation. "It made me think about life differently", he added " I thought I should really do something positive."
In 1989 Karl headed to Los Angeles where he and a good friend opened a clothing shop on Crenshaw Boulevard. They made no profit at this location and after the shop was robbed, they moved to Hollywood where Karl started selling catalogs for $2 that he and his partner had put together. They only made profit off the catalog sales and didn't actually sell any clothes. He decided to take out an advertisement in Right On!Magazine but even that didn't help jumpstart sales.
Karl Kani the success.
After watching 'The Today Show' Karl had an idea. He paid a friend in New York to make a sign with his label's name on it and hold it up during the taping of the show. The idea worked. People started calling and orders began to come in.
Upon his arrival in California he knew that he had to put a foot in an established fashion corporation before trying to establish his own sole proprietorship. When Karl met Carl Jones in 1990, co-founder of Threads 4 Life Corp, during a Cross Colours fashion show, Karl saw his chance. The partnership with Carl Jones lasted 2 years.
Karl's stylistic innovations were successful. In addition to working with a mainstream color selection he modified the baggy pants that became the basis of street fashion. According to Karl black people never liked tight fitting jeans. They would always buy a bigger size but then the waist would be too big, therefore Karl decided to increase the pant size.
In 1994, Karl $500,000 in profits to launch his company Karl Kani Infinity. In addition to his old partners, Kani now faced a marketing onslaught from hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons' Phat Farm and a number of mainstream clothiers. Kani also had reason to worry that his involvement in Cross Colours might taint his operation in the minds of retailers. "I expected some resistance," Kani himself averred. "A major turning point for me was when retailers accepted us back into the market."
Karl Kani Big & Tall.
The idea for the Big & Tall line came to Kani after numerous conversations with NBA stars, who complained that they could not fit into much of his merchandise. Big and tall people are just as fashion-conscious so Karl launched his line in mid-1995 in Big & Tall stores around the country.
Staying ahead of fashion counterfeiters who aped his signature and sold cheaper versions of his clothes, Karl began fastening a metal-and-leather plate to his product. After some initial resistance from the people who made the plates, Karl Kani decided to go ahead with it and it turned out to be his best-selling jeans ever.
Karl Kani used the metal plate to spread his positive message to others.
"Inspired by the vitality of the streets of Brooklyn New York. Karl Kani, the young African-American designer of Karl Kani Jeans, encourages you to follow your dreams and accomplish your goals. Wear the clothing that represents the knowledge of African-American creativity and determination. Recognize the signature that symbolizes African-American unity and pride... peace, Karl Kani."
A sister brand, Kani Ladies was launched in 2001.
Brand name.
Carl Williams represents the "American Dream". Son of a Costa Rican mom and Panamanian dad, Karl comes from a modest family from Brooklyn, New York. Young Karl dreamt of combining his passion for Hip Hop music and fashion. He didn't know how to do that, but he believed in himself.
During Karl's initial rough start in Los Angeles the question that had obsessed him for years, "Can I do it?", remained unanswered. He kept asking himself: "Can I do it? Can I build a fashion empire? Can I become the 'Ralph Lauren of the streets'?" Karl didn't have the answer for all these questions but it did provide the basis for his new name, Kani, a variation on "Can I?". With a stylish "K" replacing the "C" in his first name, he ventured his own optimistic reply, Karl Kani.
The Godfather of Urban fashion.
Carl Williams was the first black man to launch a Hip Hop Fashion brand and became one of the 100 richest African-Americans in 1996 according to People Magazine. He created the leopard print knickers and inspired many other to follow into his footsteps. Karl paved the way for many black designers and is the true 'Godfather of Urban Fashion'. This has earned Karl the nickname 'King of Black'.
'The Originator'.
Kani is also known as 'The Originator'. Karl was the first to set the trend of merging hip-hop with fashion. He spotted an area in the market that previously was ignored and paved the way for other Hip Hop Fashion brands. Being the first African-American man to launch a Hip Hop Fashion brand, Karl inspired many others to follow in his footsteps. His many achievements earned him the title of the 'Originator'.
The White House.
Kani's work didn't remain unnoticed. In 1999 Karl had the honor to present his latest collection at The White House to President Bill Clinton during an informal fashion show. In 1996 Karl's company was rewarded by Black Enterprise Magazine and in 2002 he received an 'Urban Fashion Award'.
Awards.
Kani is known as one of the most influential black designers of urban fashion in the United States. With such acclaimed success Black Enterprise Magazine named Karl Kani-Infinity Corporation the most successful African American owned firms worldwide in 1996. And this was just the tip of the iceberg.
In 2002 Carl was honored with an 'Urban Fashion Pioneer Award' for his lifetime achievements during the Urban Fashion Awards.

Ryan Cochrane (swimmer)

Ryan Andrew Cochrane (born October 29, 1988) is a Canadian long-distance swimmer. Cochrane is an Olympic silver and bronze medalist as well as the reigning double gold medalist in both the Commonwealth Games and the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. He holds six world championship medals from the 800 m and 1500 m, this also makes Cochrane Canada's all-time leading medalist for a swimmer at the World Aquatics Championships. For the year of 2010, Cochrane was named the Canadian male swimmer of the year at the 2010 Big Splash Awards Gala in Toronto.
Life and career.
As a sixteen-year-old Cochrane competed at the 2005 Canada Games for British Columbia. In those games he won five medals including two gold in the 800 and 1,500 m freestyle events. He rose to prominence in the Canadian sporting and aquatic world when he competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics starting in the 400 m freestyle. There he finished ninth in the heats with a Canadian record time of 3:44.85 and failed to qualify for the final. Cochrane also competed in the 1500 m freestyle where he briefly held the Olympic record after swimming a time of 14:40.84 in the heats. This record was soon broken by previous record holder Grant Hackett, who swam a time of 14:38.92. He qualified in second position for the final, and won the bronze medal on August 17. It was the first Olympic medal for a Canadian swimmer since the 2000 Summer Olympics. It was the first medal for Canada in the 1500m freestyle in 88 years.
Building on Olympic success.
Cochrane was able to back up his performance from the Olympics at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships. There he swam to a bronze in the 800 m freestyle and a silver in his best event the 1500 m freestyle.
At the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India Cochrane won Canada's first gold medal of those games in the 400 m freestyle during the first day of competition. Cochrane also became the first Canadian man in 72 years to win gold in the 400 m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games. He then went on to win another gold medal at those games, this time in the 1500 m freestyle.
Cochrane next competed at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships where he opened up with a fifth place finish in the 400 m. Next up was one of his medal hopeful events in the 800 m freestyle where he lowered his Canadian record to 7:41.86. However this was only good enough for second, as despite staying close to the hometown favourite of Shanghai, Sun Yang ultimately took the gold for China. Of the silver medal Cochrane said that "The goal was to win but I'm happy to progress from the last two years. It shows that I'm in it. I have a little more work to do to catch Sun Yang but I'm not out of it by any means."
He next competed in the 1,500 m in Shanghai where he again finished second behind Sun who swam to a world record time. Of a second finish behind Sun, Cochrane could only say that "He shows that he's had that much more base-work training and he can get to that world record, which is fantastic. I think it's great, especially for the distance events because everyone's been talking about this world record year after year and there's more pressure that's built up...He's showed amazing stroke and amazing ability."
The 2012 Summer Olympics began with Cochrane competing on the first day of competition in the 400 metre freestyle. There Cochrane won his heat and qualified in the last spot for the final. However after Park Tae-Hwan's disqualification was overturned, Cochrane was pushed out of the final and missed swimming in it by 1/100th of a second. He next entered his signature event the 1,500 m where he qualified through the heats in third place. In the final Cochrane managed to outswim Oussama Mellouli for the silver medal and achieved it in a personal best time. With his second medal at his second consecutive Olympics, according to media such as the CBC this cemented Cochrane as Canada's pillar athlete to build its swimming team around for the future as he declared that he would try and swim for Canada at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Surpassing Hayden.
The post London Olympic period saw Cochrane's first real test arrive at the 2013 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona. He swam in the 400 m and posted the second fastest time in qualifying earning him one of the centre lane spots beside Yang. As the Chinese swimmer again pulled ahead in a long-distance freestyle Cochrane found himself in a dogfight for second through fourth with the American and Japanese swimmers, despite holding a third position, he was unable to reel in the American and was just out touched by these swimmers at the wall. in the 800 m free with Yang again far ahead, there was now a four way race for second through fifth. This time Cochrane achieved a medal but was beaten at the wall again by an American swimmer, despite this Cochrane achieved his Canadian tying record fifth medal (with Brent Hayden) at the World Aquatics Championships with the bronze he earned in the 800.
Cochrane would inevitably break Hayden's record in the 1,500 m race. In this even he avoided the three and four way races that he had found himself in the shorter events and was instead in a familiar duel with Yang. Though in contrast to past 1,500's this time Cochrane took a different approach the race where the two interchangeably took the lead over alternating 100 metres, at one point Cochrane led by 0.30 seconds though in the last 100 Yang again pulled away and finished for gold. With the victory and new Canadian record Cochrane still said that he left some work on the table and hoped to progress further, "This week was filled with ups and downs. I had expectations of myself that weren't met earlier on but I was pretty proud of my races later in the week so I'm going to take that going forward. Just to get on the podium twice is fantastic but I think I have that many more dreams of being that much better next time."
Personal.
He has a twin brother Devon and a younger brother Liam Cochrane.

Gradiente Expert

The Expert, made by Gradiente Eletrônica (to date best known as a game console and Hi-Fi equipment company) was the second and last MSX home computer launched in the Brazilian market, in mid-1980s. Released one month after Epcom's Hotbit (just in time for 1985's Christmas), the Expert model XP-800 was a clone of the National CF-3000, with a computer case resembling a stereo system, a detached keyboard with a proprietary connector, no caps lock LED and no reset key.
The Expert XP-800 was followed by the Expert GPC-1 ("Gradiente Personal Computer") in 1987, and by Expert Plus and Expert DD Plus (a system with a built-in 720 KB 3½" disk drive) in 1988. The Expert users waited in vain for a MSX2 machine, but Gradiente never produced it and discontinued the MSX line in 1991.
Versions XP-800/GPC-1.
The two first versions had a graphite case and socketed chips, which caused a chronic problem: when the machine heated, the chips frequently pulled out and the system "froze". Also, the GPC-1, released in 1987, had a ROM slightly modified to solve an ASCII table compatibility issue with the other popular Brazilian MSX, Sharp's Hotbit.
Versions Plus/DD Plus.
The last two versions had a black case and the problematic socketed chips were replaced by an ASIC. Nevertheless, the RAM was mapped to a secondary slot and, although it was straight by the MSX standards, caused a lot of crashes with programs who searched for memory in the wrong place. It did not contribute for the popularity of any of the Plus versions.

Johnston, in command at Atlanta, with the "dashing" General John Bell Hood (as he actually did). Johnston, rather than leave the fortifications of Atlanta and get his army destroyed by the Union forces—as Hood did in our time line—keeps his soldiers inside, fighting a long-drawn siege war of attrition until the Northern elections of November 1864. Abraham Lincoln loses the support of the war-weary voters and George B. McClellan is elected president. McClellan orders a cease-fire, followed by a peace in which the independence of the South is recognized.
Plot summary.
Despite the South's victory, the population is still coming to terms with the enormous costs of the war. Edward A. Pollard, the editor of the "Richmond Examiner" is one of them, blaming J.E.B. Stuart for having caused the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. Seeking reelection (a historically inaccurate element, as presidents were allowed a single six year term under the provisions of the Confederate constitution), Jefferson Davis convenes a court of inquiry to provide a public airing of the accusation. Though Stuart (who, in another point of divergence, has survived his wounding at the battle of Yellow Tavern) welcomes the inquiry as an opportunity to clear his name, Davis intends to make Stuart the scapegoat for the defeat.
To represent him in the tribunal, Stuart approaches his good friend John S. Mosby. Now the head of military intelligence, Mosby accepts, juggling preparations for the inquiry with his other duties. His primary concern is "Abraham", an organization of southern African Americans pursuing an end to slavery in the South. Enjoying a cordial relationship with the movement's leader, a local businessman named Jublio, he nonetheless recruits an informant to monitor Jublio's activities.
Yet Abraham is not the Confederacy's greatest problem. A band of northern abolitionists and freed slaves, bitter at the way the war ended and southern slavery continued, form a terrorist cell known as "Amistad", named for the famous slave ship. Organized by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, they plot to infiltrate the Confederate capital of Richmond and stage an incident which will rally the slaves and restart the war. Though the cell is made up of African Americans, the leader is Salmon Brown, the surviving son of John Brown, who is consumed with guilt at having backed out of his family's raid on Harpers Ferry and determined to redeem himself. Brown is unsettled, though, by the addition of an octoroon woman named Verita to the cell, while the group's plans are jeopardized by a vainglorious member code-named Crispus who writes compromising letters to the authorities in Washington taunting them about the cell's upcoming actions. Not wanting to jeopardize relations with the Confederacy, President McClellan orders General John Rawlins to investigate the letters.
The court of inquiry attracts considerable attention from the public and the press. Many prominent women rally around the handsome Stuart, most notably Bessica Adams Southwick, a beautiful and wealthy widow. Her casual flirtation with Stuart soon develops into love, though Stuart's sense of honor restrains him from betraying his marital vows. Intrigued by the opportunity presented by the trial, Higginson arranges for Verita to travel to Richmond. Posing as a French actress, she is hosted by Southwick, who soon gives Verita access to many prominent Confederate figures, most notably Judah P. Benjamin, with whom Higginson encourages Verita to begin an affair so as to learn what the Confederate official knows about funding for underground activities. Higginson also orders the remainder of the group to Richmond in preparation for their attack.
When the inquiry begins, Mosby quickly becomes aware of the hostility of the members of the court — Braxton Bragg, George Pickett, and John Bell Hood — towards Stuart. Nonetheless, he mounts a vigorous defense of his friend. A greater challenge for him is the growing romantic interest of Spring Blakely, the niece of Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge and a secret abolitionist. While attracted to Blakeley, Mosby holds back, still grieving for his recently deceased wife. He also attempts to deal with the threat posed by Amistad. Alerted to the possibility of a plot by Rawlins, the two pursue their investigations in consultation with one another.
As the inquiry continues, Amistad prepares to carry out their plan to attack the dignitaries assembled in the courtroom. Approaching Jublio, they attempt to utilize his Abraham branch in their plans, but he keeps a wary distance from the plotters. Brown also attempts to deal with his growing jealousy over Verita's affair with Benjamin, and when confronted by her he admits his love. Distracted, he is unaware of Crispus's growing instability, which threatens to expose the group. Nevertheless, it is Crispus who identifies Mosby's informer among the Abraham organization. He kills the informer, but not before the informer succeeds in sending to Mosby a garbled name which Mosby eventually figures out is that of Salmon Brown.
Mosby enjoys a similar breakthrough in his case. After careful study of the records, he decides to shift the blame for the defeat to James Longstreet, who long sought Stuart's court-martial for his actions during the battle. With Davis's plans in ruins and the members of the court preparing to clear Stuart of all blame, the Confederate president suffers an additional blow when Robert E. Lee himself agrees to testify. Lee's appearance catalyzes the Amistad plotters. As Lee testifies in the courthouse, the plotters dynamite the Confederate White House, the destruction of which draws away many of the guards stationed at the courthouse in anticipation of an attack on the inquiry. With the courtroom weakly defended, the Amistad plotters rush the room, and gloatingly hold the famous Confederates hostage. Finally, a firefight erupts in which most of the Amistad group die, but they succeed in killing a number of people, including Benjamin, P. G. T. Beauregard, and Stuart, who dies protecting Lee - and also Rawlins of the USA. A decisive factor in the battle is the sudden appearance of the armed Jubilo, who decided to turn against the Amistad group and who kills Solomon Brown.
With Lee surviving, a US officer among those killed by the Amistad group and a prominent local Black activist having turned against the Northern Abolitionists, the incident fails to reignite war between the USA and CSA, as the conspirators hoped. However, there is much rioting and bloodshed inside the Confederacy's own territory, with angry mobs attacking random Blacks and the Black activists of "Abraham" succeeding to fight back in some locations. A meeting between Mosby and Jubilo in the aftermath gives the impression that the Confederate government would have to change its attitude to the Black population - not only eventually abolish slavery but also grant civil rights to the increasingly organized and self-aware Blacks.
Meanwhile, Verita - the only one of the Amistad group to survive the fighting - is sentenced to death. She haughtily rebuffs Mosby's suggestion that she ask for clemency, telling him "I will be alive when you are dust" and prepares to die as a martyr and create a heroic myth for future radicals.
Literary criticism and reception.
A review in the "Virginia Quarterly Review" said of the novel "Skimin crafts his characters and their setting with such care that one cannot help but enjoy the ruse—and marvel at the story's finale. A history lover's delicacy."

The Military Technical Agreement between the International Security Force ("KFOR") and the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia, often known as simply the Military Technical Agreement or MTA or as the Kumanovo Agreement, was an agreement concluded on 9 June 1999.

Status of Agreement.
Some legal academics have argued that the Kumanovo Agreement "is dubious under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) and, as a consequence, so too are parts of Resolution 1244 referring, implicitly or explicitly, to paragraph 10 of Annex 2 of the same resolution." One particular argument is that "it is doubtful whether the Kumanovo Agreement can be considered valid according to Article 52 of the VCLT, which states that ‘a treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations’. The legal arguments continue that in fact to remedy the legal issues arising what is needed is for Status of Forces Agreement to be entered into with Belgrade.

The Anglican diocese of Trinidad and Tobago is the administrative structure grouping together Anglicans in the nation of Trinidad and Tobago under a bishop. As of 2009, it included 30 parishes, and was responsible for 59 primary schools, one special school, and nine high schools. It is part of the Church in the Province of the West Indies. The current bishop of Trinidad and Tobago is The Right Reverend Claude Berkley.
History.
The diocese was set up in 1872. Originally, the area was nominally under the charge of the Bishop of London, a situation which had been assumed to hold from 1660 onwards. In 1813, the then Bishop of London denied it was his responsibility, and so it turned out that clergy appointments to the Church in the Colonies were recommended by the local governor, in this case the governor of the Leeward Islands. From 1824 until 1872 the area was administered by the Bishop of Barbados. The coat of arms of the diocese was granted by the College of Arms in London in 1951, and includes the Alpha and Omega and a version of the Shield of the Trinity.

1913 Gettysburg reunion

The 1913 Gettysburg reunion was a Gettysburg Battlefield encampment of American Civil War veterans for the Battle of Gettysburg's 50th anniversary. The June 29–July 4 gathering of 53,407 veterans (~8,750 Confederate) was the largest ever Civil War veteran reunion, and ""never before in the world's history "" so great a number of men so advanced in years been assembled under field conditions"" (Chief Surgeon). All honorably discharged veterans in the Grand Army of the Republic and the United Confederate Veterans were invited, and veterans from 46 of the 48 states attended (cf. Nevada). Despite concerns "that there might be unpleasant differences, at least, between the blue and gray" (as after England's War of the Roses and the French Revolution), the peaceful reunion was repeatedly marked by events of Union–Confederate camaraderie. President Woodrow Wilson's July 4 reunion address summarized the spirit: ""We have found one another again as brothers and comrades in arms, enemies no longer, generous friends rather, our battles long past, the quarrel forgotten—except that we shall not forget the splendid valor.""
Planning.
After numerous smaller Gettysburg reunions, including the 1906 Philadelphia Brigade/Pickett's Division reunion during which Brig. Gen. Armistead's captured sword was returned to the South, in April 1908 General Henry S. Huidekoper of Philadelphia suggested a 1913 50th anniversary reunion to Pennsylvania Governor Edwin Sydney Stuart. On September 8, the Gettysburg National Park Commission met with Gettysburg borough officials about the event, Stuart conducted a sub-committee meeting on October 25, and Stuart addressed the General Assembly in January 1909.
On May 13, 1909, the Pennsylvania Assembly created the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg Commission, and the commission's "first tentative programme" of October 13, 1910 included a "Peace Jubilee" with noon July 3 placement of the cornerstone for a "Great Peace Memorial". The August 26, 1912, US Congress bill appropriated $150K and directed the War Department establish the camp, but the memorial funding was not approved and the "Peace Jubilee" plans were removed from the schedule. The site for the camp and the for the Great Tent west of the Codori House were selected in 1912 and mapped by the Gettysburg National Park Commission. The Park Commission also completed painting of avenue fencing, gun carriages, iron tablets, pyramids, and shells from 1912 through June 30, 1913. On April 13, 1913, the Pennsylvania commission completed the Pennsylvania State Memorial and also mailed 40,000 veteran's invitations. On June 28, President Woodrow Wilson notified the Pennsylvania commission he would attend the reunion for a "very limited period". The 33 contributing states provided a total of $1,033,000 for the reunion ($450,000 from Pennsylvania).
The Pennsylvania commission headquarters at Gettysburg was at 231 Baltimore St, with the Harrisburg office of the Secretary (later nicknamed the "Duke of Gettysburg") in Pennsylvania State Capitol Room 509. Various commemorative tokens and programs were developed for attendees, including 3 types of Pennsylvania badges ("PRESS", "GUEST", "SCOUT"), a commemorative medal, and a souvenir program of poems by the attending "Veteran Scout", Jack Crawford. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company also added "a telephone line between Gettysburg and Hanover along the Western Maryland Railway, over which the Pennsy operate a large number of trains during the battle anniversary". On the Chambersburg-Gettysburg turnpike and the Gettysburg-Petersburg turnpike, tolls ended in time for the reunion when on June 27, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the 1911 Sproul Roads Act, by which the Commonwealth acquired private toll roads.
By February 1, 1913, water wells were being drilled for the July encampment, and by June 26 hotels in Hanover, Chambersburg, Hagerstown, and "the Blue Ridge section filling rapidly". For entertainment, a Gettysburg facility was started in 1912 to display the Boston version of the Gettysburg Cyclorama,[http://books.google.com/books?id=SdrYv7S60fgC&pg=PA542 and the now lost "The Battle of Gettysburg" black & white film of 1913 was first run at Walter's Theatre on June 26. Local planning for the reunion included expanding the Gettysburg hackman's tax to automobiles (upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1914), a 50 cent maximum for taxi fares in the borough,[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=66RcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZlgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6960,1224251&dq=hackmen+gettysburg&hl=en and an obscure request from a few Missouri veterans regarding the availability near Gettysburg of "a few good widows or old maids … good housekeepers and not too young" to go west after the reunion (the "kind-hearted mayor", J. A. Holtzworth, agreed to forward photos to the veterans in the "Cupid … operations")!
Facilities.
The War Department's Great Camp (Gettysburg Encampment, Anniversary Camp, Veterans Camp) provided tents and support facilities for the Civil War veterans and extended from both sides of Long Lane on the north [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FB091FFF3A5F13738DDDA00A94DE405B838DF1D3] to within 500 yards of the Bliss House. The Great Camp included the Great Tent (Big Tent, 200 x 450 ft) "with its thirteen thousand chairs"; the veterans' tents; quarters for 1,466 War Department soldiers (including camp commander Gen. Liggitt) & 2,179 mess personnel; 385 camp Boy Scouts from Washington; and other camp personnel for a total of 57,198 ""persons quartered and subsisted in the Great Camp"". The camp had a temporary U. S. Post Office; 90 Pennsylvania Health Department latrines throughout the camp with a seating capacity of 3,476; and near the Great Tent, an Emergency Station and 2 Comfort Houses of the health dept, which also supplied the Great Tent water fountains. The Pennsylvania commission also set up a temporary morgue in the camp. A special platform on the Round Top Branch was built for veterans to disembark from steamtrains directly into the camp (in February, trolleys of the Gettysburg Electric Railway had been prohibited from using the branch).
After the state health department's Chief Engineer had estimated Gettysburg (pop. 4,500) would be inundated with 100,000 people, the borough agreed to the Commissioner of Health's request for his department to take over medical and sanitation efforts in the area from June 25-July 25. The department set up a field hospital at the Kurtz property facing Brickyard Lane on the north foot of East Cemetery Hill, as well as 6 Comfort Stations in the borough (1 at each railroad station), with a total of ~100 hoppers. The department also tested borough wells and mitigated contamination sources upstream of the Water Works supply on Marsh Crek. The American Red Cross Society, along with 72 additional Boy Scouts operated fourteen 7 ft x 7 ft Relief Stations for first aid and rest on the battlefield park roads, and the Tuberculosis Dispensary in Gettysburg was also used as a Relief Station.
Attached to the Great Camp were a battery of the Third United States Field Artillery and several companies of Regular Infantry. Companies A-D (14 officers & 285 men) of the Fifteenth United States Cavalry arrived on June 26 for guarding the battlefield and camped west of Seminary Ridge on the Hagerstown Rd, while a "model Camp" for a Pennsylvania cavalry squadron was on the "College Athletic Field" adjoining the Commission's Headquarters. A total of 527 people were quartered at both the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg & the Pennsylvania College ("Gettysburg College" in 1921), including the Pennsylvania Gettysburg Commission, 4 troops of Pennsylvania State Police, and in tents, Governor Tener's staff. Additional nearby encampments included the leased Newspaper Row ("Meadeboro") with 155 journalists north of the Gettysburg National Cemetery, an encampment of 30 Boy Scouts near Cashtown west of Gettysburg for traveler services on the Chambersburg-Gettysburg Pike, and Philadelphia and Baltimore salvation army encamped in Stonesifer's Grove at Biglerville, Pennsylvania.[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JlYzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CPMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2540,3049345&dq=pathe-weekly+gettysburg&hl=en]
Events.
The Great Camp opened for supper on June 29 with Pennsylvania veterans from the state reunion that adjourned on June 28 and other early veterans (e.g. 2 Confederate vets of Culp's Hill had arrived on June 26). The 21,000 arrivals on the 29th instead of the 6,000 expected by Capt McCaskey of the Quartermasters Corps resulted in initial shortages (some veterans left without staying). After the 1912 base of the Virginia Monument was dedicated on June 30, official reunion events began on July 1, Veteran's Day, and included a speech by John Wanamaker.[http://williamzulker.com/john_wanamaker]
Departures included 12,000 veterans on July 2 and about the same number on July 3, and dismantling of the Great Camp began immediately after the July 4 Tribute. The hospital closed on July 5, and the last veteran left on July 8. The annual military instructional camp (250 college students)used a few tents of the veterans camp while encamped at the "Meadeboro" camp (Newspaper Row) from July 7-August 15.[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_b9cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rVgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1011,6646691&dq=newspaper-row+gettysburg&hl=en The Quartermaster headquarters on Baltimore St closed on August 13, and by August 15 the entire Grand Camp had been removed except "four great water storage reservoirs". A movie, "United at Gettysburg", documented the reunion,[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zcxJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-IQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5136,1059610&dq=pathe-weekly+gettysburg&hl=en] and Lt Col Lewis E. Beitler, Secretary of the Commission, completed the compilation of the organizations' reports on the December 31, 1913.
To commemorate the 1913 Gettysburg reunion, a colonial portico was opened in May 1914 at the Seminary's Old Dorm (only the concrete base remains),[http://books.google.com/books?id=rFHr8ti5sAwC&pg=PA164 and the 1938 Eternal Light Peace Memorial was erected on Oak Ridge, north of Gettysburg.

Beardmore W.B.V

The Beardmore W.B.V was a prototype British single-engine shipborne biplane fighter of World War I developed by Beardmore. It was not successful, only two being completed.
Development and design.
At the same time as developing the Beardmore W.B.IV, G Tilghman-Richards, the chief designer of Beardmore, designed a second aircraft to meet an Admiralty requirement for a ship-borne fighter aircraft to be armed with a 37 mm Le-Puteaux quick firing gun in order to destroy airships. The resulting aircraft, the W.B.V, was a single seater two-bay tractor biplane powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Hispano-Suiza engine. The wings folded for storage onboard ship. The manually loaded Le-Puteaux gun was mounted between the cylinder banks of the V-8 engine, firing through a hollow propeller shaft. Unlike the W.B.V, the W.B.IV was not fitted with a buoyancy chamber, being instead fitted with inflatable flotation bags.
The first prototype flew on 3 December 1917. During testing, the Le Puteaux gun was considered dangerous by RNAS pilots, and the aircraft was re-armed with a more conventional synchronised Vickers machine gun together with a Lewis gun mounted on a tripod mounting. Development was abandoned shortly after the completion of a second prototype.

Dominic Cooke

Dominic Cooke CBE (born 1966) is an English theatre director and playwright. He won the 2007 Laurence Olivier Award for best director for his revival of "The Crucible" while working at the RSC. He took over as the Artistic Director of the Royal Court Theatre in London in 2006 and his tenure was widely hailed a success staging much new work and refocusing the aims of the theatre. Apart from being a successful director he has also adapted Malorie Blackman's novel "Noughts and Crosses" for stage and wrote a version of "Arabian Nights".
Early life.
Born in Wimbledon, London Cooke's mother was an NHS receptionist who had once wanted to be an actress and his father a film editor. He was brought up seeing a lot of theatre as a teenager from free theatre tickets provided by London Education Authority. He studied at Warwick University. He moved into television after university with his first job being a runner.
Career.
He started up his own theatre company "Pan Optic" which he ran for two years before becoming an assistant director at the RSC in the 1990s and worked as a freelance director. He started writing at the Royal Court under Stephen Daldry in 1995 before becoming an associate director at the Royal Court for Ian Rickson in 1999. In 2003 he left the Court returning to the RSC for Michael Boyd where he directed his acclaimed version of The Crucible starring Iain Glen which won him the 2007 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Director.

Cooke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to drama.
Royal Court.
In 2006 Cooke became the Artistic Director of the Royal Court Theatre in London. He came to Royal Court at a time where the theatre had been criticised for softening its political agenda and having 'lost its way'. Cooke promised to refocus the theatre and famously promised to stage plays that would ""explore what it means to be middle class, what it means to have power, and what it means to have wealth...plays seem to be about the dispossessed, which is important, but you can't really understand a world if you're only looking at one corner of it, and that kind of theatre is really just as reactionary in its way as the theatre pre-George Devine all french windows and all that."" As well as staging some successful revivals Cooke has also pioneered new writing promoting the Royal Court's Young Writers' Programme and writers such as Polly Stenham and Bola Agbaje have had their debut plays staged during his time. It was during his tenure that the massive successes of Jerusalem, Clybourne Park (directed by himself) and Enron were staged which both transferred to the West End.
Royal National Theatre.
In November 2011 Cooke made his directing debut at the Royal National Theatre in London, with The Comedy of Errors by William Shakespeare. The play, with stage design by Bunny Christie, was set in modern-day London. The cast included Lenny Henry as Antipholus of Ephesus and Claudie Blakley as Adriana. The production was selected to be broadcast live to selected cinemas worldwide in March 2012 as part of the National Theatre Live programme.
Writing.
In 2007 he wrote the stage adaptation of Malorie Blackman's "Noughts and Crosses" which he directed and produced at the RSC. He also wrote an adaptation of "Arabian Nights" for Young Vic in 1998. He directed a revised version for the RSC in 2009.
Private Life.
Cooke is openly gay. He has been with his partner, the actor and award-winning playwright Alexi Kaye Campbell since 1997.

Terry Morris (artist and photographer)

Terry Morris (born 6 September 1965 in Llanelli) is a Welsh artist who is primarily known for his photography.
Early life.
Terry Morris was born in Llanelli in September 1965. He attended Lakefield Infant and Primary School before moving on to Graig Comprehensive School, Llanelli.
Self-confessed as ‘not the best academic’, Terry lost interest in school during his teens and only stayed on his final year, aged 15, to study woodwork with his favourite teacher ‘Mr Evans’ (Mike Evans), lovingly known as ‘Killer’ (due to his Size 13 plimsole!)
Terry left school at 16 and joined the Parachute Regiment in which he served for five years.
During the following years he worked in many different jobs, including as a labourer for his father’s building firm, before settling as a welder for Llanelli-based sound and lighting firm PA Installations.
Early career.
In his 30s Terry went back to college (Gorseinon College) to study Black and White Documentary Photography before starting on the freelance circuit working weekends for the local newspapers (Llanelli Star and Evening Post).
Still employed by PA Installations, Terry was offered a week’s work with the Star when the staff photographer took a week’s annual leave. Seeing it as his chance, Terry took a week’s sick leave from his employer to cut his teeth as a ‘proper’ freelance photographer – only to be caught red-handed by his boss halfway through the week and sacked on the spot!
He then went on to work regularly for local and regional media titles before starting to hit the front pages of national tabloids and broadsheets.
Press photography started to lose its appeal in the early 2000s when Terry’s ambitions started to grow. A chance to photograph former Stereophonics drummer Stuart Cable, who was in town having his latest tattoo, led to him taking his first steps towards achieving his ambition of becoming the first portrait photographer to capture a photographic Welsh Hall of Fame – later to become known as the "Cool Cymru Collection"
Cool Cymru.
In 2006 his first published collection, entitled "Cool Cymru" was exhibited at the Wales Millennium Centre, becoming the first photographic collection to hang on its walls. Opened at the launch by one of the collection's featured stars, Charlotte Church, all 12 prints in the original collection were auctioned, raising over £20,000 for The Noah's Ark Appeal, the fundraising arm of the Children's Hospital of Wales. It went on to tour other Welsh venues.
Launched alongside the photographic collection, the book "Cool Cymru Collection" . included his portraiture and documented his struggles to finance his dream project and make it a reality. There was also a three-part television documentary filmed by Llanelli-based production company Tinopolis.
Those pictured in the collection were:
Latest additions to the collection include Welsh rugby hero Shane Williams, the world's richest living painter Andrew Vicari, Wales First Minister Rhodri Morgan and Welsh actor Matthew Rhys.
Stradey Park.
In 2008, Morris's second photo-based book was published. Faces of Stradey Park documented the final season of a Welsh rugby ground which was home to Llanelli RFC and professional region the Llanelli Scarlets for 129 years until October 2008. Morris and writer Andy Pearson were granted access to the ground throughout the 2007-08 rugby season to gather material for the book. It featured the stadium's November 2007 funeral service for rugby player and broadcaster Ray Gravell.
Artist’s Jubilee Gift to Queen.
Terry Morris, Carmarthenshire’s Ambassador for the Arts, presented the Queen with a unique Diamond Jubilee tribute, his own portrait of Her Majesty.
Morris had been working on the Royal portrait for a year and it forms part of a pair. The sister picture has been presented to the Tate Gallery in London for its collection. Morris says:
“As this is a very special year, I wanted to make a special gesture. She said that she was touched, and that the painting had given her much pleasure.” He comments: 
“Over the years I have photographed and painted a great number of famous faces, but Her Majesty is in quite a different league. Her image is on coins, banknotes, stamps and in the media worldwide. It was a real challenge to try and capture her in a unique way. I have spent twelve months trying to get it right. I hope I have succeeded - I have tried to capture both the iconic and the human sides of Her Majesty.”
This is not the first time that Morris has pictured the Queen. During the Millennium celebrations in 2000 he was asked to take a photographic portrait during a Royal visit to South Wales. He recalls:
“Unfortunately she was on a very tight schedule so I had to work very quickly. After the session I felt that I hadn’t done Her Majesty justice. That planted the seed of the idea to paint this portrait. I wanted to get it right.”
In his role as Ambassador for the Arts in Carmarthenshire, Morris works with children and young people, encouraging them to think creatively and express themselves. He says:
“I hope I can show the next generation that the arts are not only fun and rewarding, but offer a range of great opportunities for careers. The creative industries are a big part of Wales’ future and we need to harness all that emerging talent we have. Perhaps when the Queen celebrates her Platinum Jubilee one of these youngsters will be presenting her with another portrait.”

A group called The Street People hit #35 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1970 with the song "Jennifer Tomkins". The group's vocalist was Rupert Holmes.
This group was not, however, the same as the R&B/disco group from New Jersey who first began recording in 1974. They were produced by Ray Dahrouge and initially recorded for Spring Records, but their first single flopped. After switching to Vigor Records, they released a full-length self-titled album in 1976 and had several hit singles on the US "Billboard" R&B chart.

<doc id="18878202" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18878202" title="Greek Junta Trials">
Greek Junta Trials

The Greek Junta Trials () were the trials involving members of the military junta that ruled Greece from 21 April 1967 to 23 July 1974. These trials involved the instigators of the coup as well as other junta members of various ranks who took part in the events of the Athens Polytechnic uprising and in the torture of citizens.
The military coup leaders were formally arrested during the "metapolitefsi" period that followed the junta, and in early August 1975 the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis brought charges of high treason and insurrection against Georgios Papadopoulos and other co-conspirators. The mass trial, described as "Greece's Nuremberg" and known as "The Trial of the Instigators", was staged at the Korydallos Prison amidst heavy security.
The principal leaders of the 1967 coup, Georgios Papadopoulos, Stylianos Pattakos and Nikolaos Makarezos, were sentenced to death for high treason, following the trial. Shortly after the sentences were pronounced, they were commuted to life imprisonment by the Karamanlis government.
The trial of the instigators was followed by a second trial which investigated the events surrounding the Athens Polytechnic uprising known as "The Trial of the Polytechnic" and, finally, a series of trials involving incidents of torture known in Greece as "The Trials of the Torturers".
Journalist and author Leslie Finer, who was expelled by the junta from Greece in 1968, reporting in 1975 on the trials for "New Society" wrote: "The trial of 20 ringleaders of the 1967 coup is a test of democratic justice. Among its other functions, this is a mode of exorcism and education."
Historical background.
After the fall of the junta in July 1974, as the country entered the period of the "metapolitefsi" and before the legislative elections in November of the same year, the transitional government headed by Konstantinos Karamanlis came under growing criticism from the opposition, including Georgios Mavros, the leader of the Center Union-New Forces (the main opposition party at the time), about being too lenient to the members of the recently deposed military junta.
Mavros had demanded the arrest of the junta principals as a condition for cleaning up the political life of the country. At the time he declared that as soon as the Parliament was convened after the 1974 elections, he would propose legislation to annul any automatic immunity laws which the junta might have enacted to protect its members.
The newspapers further demanded an investigation into the role of Brigadier Ioannidis during the crushing of the Polytechnic uprising, which the press called a "massacre". Ioannidis was the shadowy leader of the junta's final stage who had been described as the "invisible dictator" in the press.
Karamanlis' government responded to these demands and ordered the junta principals Georgios Papadopoulos, Stylianos Pattakos, Nikolaos Makarezos, Ioannis Ladas and Michael Roufogalis arrested.
In addition, Georgios Papadopoulos, Dimitrios Ioannidis, Michael Roufogalis, Nikolaos Dertilis, Vassilios Bouklakos and Elias Tsiaouris or Tsapouris (also Tsiaparas), who were also responsible of the Polytechnic events were prohibited from leaving the country, as rumours were circulating that they were planning to escape abroad.
On 24 October 1974, Georgios Papadopoulos, Stylianos Pattakos, Nikolaos Makarezos, Ioannis Ladas and Michael Roufogalis were arrested and charged with conspiring again. Subsequently they were sent to the island of Kea.
Ioannidis, was not arrested at that time, with the official explanation that he did not take part in the conspiracy of the Papadopoulos group. However the newspapers, such as "To Vima", alleged, citing reliable sources, that Ioannidis had disappeared and could not be found.
Immediately after the group of five was exiled to Kea, the opposition demanded to know the details of the actions of Papadopoulos and his co-conspirators prior to their arrest, while the government denied rumours of pro-junta manoeuvres among the military.
During his stay in Kea, Papadopoulos seemed confident that he and the members of his junta would be granted amnesty and they would eventually run for office and get elected. However, following a three-month stay on the island, in February 1975, Papadopoulos and the other four junta principals were transported by a torpedo boat to the port of Piraeus on their way to Korydallos prison. Ioannidis, having been arrested on 14 January 1975, was already at the jail when Papadopoulos and his cohorts arrived there.
The instigators.
Trial of the instigators of the 21 April 1967 coup.
On 28 July 1975, the trial of the instigators of the coup () commenced with Ioannis Deyannis as the presiding judge; Deyannis had been appointed to the high court of "Areios Pagos" during the junta years. The mandate of the trial was to examine the events surrounding the 21 April 1967 coup, for which Papadopoulos and over twenty other co-defendants were charged with acts of high treason and mutiny. Security surrounding the trial was heavy: one thousand soldiers armed with submachine guns were guarding the jail's perimeter, and the roads leading to the jail were patrolled by tanks.
Despite these developments, Papadopoulos expressed his confidence to reporters that he would not remain incarcerated for long. He also assumed full responsibility for the April coup but refused to defend himself. Following Papadopoulos' lead, Stylianos Pattakos, Nikolaos Makarezos and other junta members announced that they would not participate in the trial. Dimitrios Ioannidis announced that the trial was "unfortunately not interesting".
The defence announced that the reason their clients were not participating was that the Karamanlis government had prejudiced the outcome of the trial by declaring the 1967 coup a criminal offense. The lawyers of sixteen of the defendants walked out of the courtroom on the first day of the proceedings, declaring that they could not carry out their duties under a climate of terror and violence, to which the presiding judge Ioannis Deyannis replied: "Let all those who wish to leave—leave!".
Although there was an agreement between the defendants that they would keep silent during the trial and would not issue any statements, Papadopoulos broke his silence and declared to the Court that: "I am the leader of the Revolution and I am responsible for everything". Pattakos, Makarezos and the rest of the junta members were surprised to hear Papadopoulos' statement because they believed they had an agreement that they would not politicize the trial based on their belief that they had nothing to gain. In their view their support among the people and in the army was non-existent.
The charge of mutiny was contested because even though the colonels had in fact seized power illegally, they did so with the approval of their superior officer Lieutenant General Grigorios Spandidakis, who even joined the coup. Further Karamanlis himself, by accepting the invitation of junta-appointed President Phaedon Gizikis to return to Greece, conferred a measure of legitimacy to the junta. In addition it was Gizikis who swore-in Karamanlis as Prime Minister.
During the trial, Spandidakis, Zoitakis and Stamatelopoulos differentiated their position from that of the other junta members. This divergence from the common defence line led Papadopoulos to strongly chastise one of his defence lawyers for trying to question one of Zoitakis' witnesses. He is reported as exclaiming: "He is not one of our witnesses. Do not ask him questions".
Ioannidis declared to the court: "I accept my participation in the revolution of 21 April 1967. I have always been a soldier throughout my life and I acted on my duty according to my conscience. I have nothing else to add." Deyannis, commented: "You are not being accused of participating in the revolution. You are accused of two crimes –do not be afraid of the term– high treason, this term is not very honourable to be attributed to you, and second crime for which you are being accused is mutiny. For these two crimes you are accused. About revolution, you are not being accused. What do you plead?" Ioannidis then replied: "I accept my participation in the revolution and any consequences arising from that".
Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, the last legitimate Prime Minister of Greece prior to the coup, acting as witness for the prosecution, testified how he was arrested by machine-gun toting soldiers and transported to the palace to meet King Constantine. He added that during the meeting he urged the king to use his status as commander-in-chief of the Greek military to order loyal officers to crush the coup. He stated that Constantine refused to do so because he feared bloodshed.
Kanellopoulos also stated at the trial that, against his advice, King Constantine swore-in the government of the colonels, an action which had helped legitimise their rule. Kanellopoulos' testimony had the effect of undermining the charge of mutiny. Kanellopoulos, during his testimony, also accepted his responsibility "before history" for not preempting the coup. He testified that there was no indication at all that the colonels were plotting "behind the backs" of the highest echelons of the army leadership.
Papadopoulos refused to testify and only declared: "I shall answer only to history and to the Greek people"; to which presiding justice Deyannis retorted: "Do you think history is absent from this courtroom?" Papadopoulos did not respond.
The question of the involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the coup, a widely held belief in Greece, was not answered at the trial. Deyannis forbade all discussion on the subject with the remark that the trial was only confined to discovering the facts involved on the day the coup occurred. The only testimony about CIA involvement was given by Andreas Papandreou, who insisted that the colonels worked closely with the CIA.
Verdict.
The trial of the instigators ended on 23 August 1975. Papadopoulos, Nikolaos Makarezos and Stylianos Pattakos were sentenced to death by firing squad, while Dimitrios loannides received a life sentence. Seven others were sentenced to terms ranging from five to 20 years and two were acquitted. The crimes were deemed "momentary" and not "continuous" and considered to have lasted only between 20–21 April 1967. The verdict made it impossible to prosecute the collaborators of the junta.
This is the detailed table of the main sentences:
The death sentences were later commuted to life incarceration by the Karamanlis government.
On 28 August 1975 Konstantinos Karamanlis declared: "When we say life we mean life [sentence", meaning that the commutation of the sentences from death to life imprisonment would not be followed by further reductions.
The Polytechnic.
Trial of the Polytechnic.
On 16 October 1975, at 9 a.m., the second trial, investigating the events surrounding the Athens Polytechnic uprising () started in the same courtroom as the first trial, and lasted a total of fifty-seven days. There were thirty-three indicted including Papadopoulos, Ioannidis, M. Roufogalis, Vassilios Bouklakos, Elias Tsiaouris or Tsiaparas and Nikos Dertilis. Papadopoulos, Ioannidis, Roufogalis and Nikos Dertilis were already convicted and serving their sentences from the first trial.
The only defendant not present at the Polytechnic trial was Elias Tsiaouris or Tsiaparas, accused of murder, who had escaped custody because he was in hiding. There were a total of 237 witnesses for the prosecution and the defence and about 50 lawyers.
The preliminary investigation for the events of the Polytechnic was carried out by prosecutor Dimitrios Tsevas, who submitted the results of his investigation to the office of the prosecutor general on 14 October 1974. In his report, Tsevas determined that Ioannidis and his deputy Roufogalis were on the scene during the events and directed their men with the purpose to create, through shootings and violence, conditions which would benefit Ioannidis' planned coup against Papadopoulos.
Ioannidis and Papadopoulos, even though they were sitting close to each other, never once exchanged a look. During the second trial a documentary film was shown, shot by Dutch journalists, which showed the events surrounding the three-day event centering around Polytechnic School from the time the students entered to the crushing of the Polytechnic gates by the tanks. During the projection, Papadopoulos did not pay attention to the film, mostly looking down, while Ioannidis was watching the film, reportedly unperturbed.
Antonis Agritelis, driver of Dertilis' jeep, testified that he saw Dertilis execute a youth on Patission Avenue. According to Agritelis' testimony, after the execution, Dertilis reentered the jeep and boasted about his marksmanship. Dertilis disputed Agritelis' testimony but the Court convicted him partly based on this testimony.
Pattakos testified that he called Ioannidis to his office in September 1973 because of rumours that he was planning the overthrow of the Papadopoulos regime. Ioannidis denied the rumours and actually reassured Pattakos, on his "military honour", that he was a supporter of the Constitution and of Papadopoulos' reforms. Pattakos also mentioned that he knew very well that in the afternoon of 24 November 1973 Ioannidis had been called by Papadopoulos himself and, with Makarezos present, he again vehemently denied any rumours about planning a coup. Pattakos added that a few hours after that meeting, around 3:30 a.m. the next day, the tanks appeared in the streets of Athens and Phaedon Gizikis was sworn early that morning as figurehead President of the Republic.
On the second day of the trial, Papadopoulos' defence lawyers Karagiannopoulos, Papaspyrou and Steiropoulos raised the objection that the court did not have jurisdictional authority over their client regarding the events of the Polytechnic, because he had Presidential immunity as President of Greece during the time of the events and demanded an immediate ruling from the court. The court went immediately in recess for further deliberations. Once the proceedings resumed the Court announced its decision. The court found that Papadopoulos was not immune from prosecution as President of the Republic at the time of the events because the 21 April 1967 coup initiated violence against the Greek State and usurped the power and legal authority of the people and therefore all subsequent governments of the junta were deemed by the court to be products of violence. Consequently the Court found that Papadopoulos was not a legitimate President of the Republic at the time, and as such not immune from prosecution.
The full, unanimous, decision of the Court, rejecting Papadopoulos' motion for immunity, stated the following:
Following the ruling about immunity, Ioannidis' lawyer Giorgos Alfantakis made a motion to split and postpone the trial on the grounds that the indictment did not have a complete rationale: although it was mentioned in the order that Ioannidis encouraged and persuaded unit commanders of the security forces to act in a criminal fashion during the suppression of the uprising, the names of the commanders were not mentioned in the indictment. The court rejected the motion on the grounds that it could not annul the indictment.
Verdict.
On 31 December 1975, the five-member court in Athens convicted 20 of the 32 accused and held Ioannidis as the only person morally responsible for the events.
The main sentences are shown in the following table:
The torturers.
Trials of the torturers.
In addition to the two civil trials of the instigators and the Polytechnic events, there were another six trials, which concerned the use of torture by the regime (, "The Trials of the Torturers"). Two of the trials involved the court martial of members of the EAT/ESA military police. The first trial started 7 August 1975 at the Athens Permanent Court
Martial, and the second trial on 13 October 1975, with the verdict announced on 9 December 1975. In total, the defendants totalled 18 officers and 14 soldiers of the non commissioned rank who all faced charges arising from using torture during interrogations. The second trial investigated torture allegations centering on Bogiati jail and in army units located in the Attica Prefecture. These trials were followed by four additional trials involving allegations of torture concerning members of the security forces and the police. The last of the torture trials started in November 1976. Overall there were between one hundred to four hundred torturers' trials. The number is uncertain because detailed centralised records of the number of the trials were not kept.
The charges during the first ESA torturers' trial were:
A problem for the prosecution was the theft and destruction of the ESA files, which was described as "wholesale". These files were never recovered and were not used in any of the trials. In fact, documents which were initially exhibited in court by senior ESA officers later vanished without ever being found.
During the EAT/ESA trials, Theodoros Theophilogiannakos pleaded with the army leadership to not convict any of the accused lower-rank EAT/ESA personnel. His rationale was that these convictions would encourage the newly legalised Communist Party to threaten EAT/ESA men with punishment in case the soldiers executed legally dubious orders. This would demoralize the men and make them second-guess the legality of each order issued to them. The soldiers would then disobey any order issued by their commanders, when in doubt as to the legitimacy of that order. Refusing to obey an order would be illegal from the standpoint of the army and would shake the discipline of the military, in Theophilogiannakos' view. He went on to state: "Sentence us, the commanding officers, to death if you like. All that matters is to save the State".
The prosecutor told the Court about Theophilogiannakos:
Guided by a blind anti-communism, he attributed even the slightest opposition to the dictatorial regime to the "Communist finger" 
During the second trial Theophilogiannakos asked the court to disallow testimony from Kostas Kappos, a Communist member of Parliament, on the grounds that he was an atheist. Spanos, instead of giving testimony, declared that the "Revolution" was betrayed like Cyprus, while Hadjizisis claimed that the ESA interrogators went through a worse ordeal than the actual interrogation victims.
One of the accused, Dimitrios Kofas, was notorious as the "orange juice doctor" because he prescribed orange juice as a panacea for any ailment, including those resulting from torture. In a patient case involving the Air Force officer Nikolaos Stapas, Kofas prescribed orange juice for hematuria caused by severe torture. The doctor was convicted for eleven documented cases of dereliction of his medical duties.
The closing remarks of the prosecutor in one of the EAT/ESA trials were:
The torturers wanted to present EAT/ESA not as a place of torture but as a national reformatory. Modestly reserving to themselves infallibility of judgement, they have tried to follow in the footsteps of the Holy Inquisition.
Verdict.
Sentencing table for the two ESA trials:
Incarceration.
In prison the junta principals addressed each other using their former titles such as "Minister" and "President" and showed great deference to Papadopoulos. However, Papadopoulos did not readily socialise and preferred to dine alone. The then-warden of Korydallos prison, Yannis Papathanassiou later published the book "Prison Diary: Korydallos 1975–79", where he described the amenities that the incarcerated junta members enjoyed, such as air conditioners, television sets and tennis courts.
Papathanassiou in his book describes how the Justice Ministry, under pressure from junta sympathisers, ordered these special arrangements for the prisoners. Papathanassiou also detailed his continuous vigilance trying to uncover escape plots. He also revealed how, through their lawyers, the prisoners got involved in the 1977 Greek legislative election supporting a right wing party. The regular population of the prison became so incensed about the preferential treatment given to the junta members that they rioted.
A plan to grant amnesty to the junta principals by the Konstantinos Mitsotakis government in 1990 was cancelled after protests from conservatives, socialists and communists alike.
Papadopoulos and seven other members of the junta were housed in the maximum security A-block. Papadopoulos resided on the second floor of the compound along with the other members of his regime, while Ioannidis resided on the ground floor.
Although Pattakos and Makarezos were let out of jail early due to health reasons, Papadopoulos never asked for clemency and remained in jail until his death. He died in hospital on 27 June 1999, after being transferred from Korydallos.
During his incarceration, Ioannidis was reported as reading military books and books about the CIA. Because of his involvement in Papadopoulos' overthrow he was accused by the right wing that he betrayed the oath he gave in the summer of 1971 in front of Papadopoulos and another twenty junta members that he would recognise Papadopoulos as the leader of the "Revolution", i.e. the junta, and thus he was held responsible for the subsequent events, especially the regime's ultimate collapse. Consequently he did not come into contact with Papadopoulos and the other junta members around him and he spent most of his time alone in an isolated cell. Despite that, he sometimes arranged parties attended by members of the ESA military police, who resided on the third floor of the compound.
Ioannidis and co-conspirator Nikos Dertilis never asked for a pardon. By the end of 2005, lawyers representing Ioannidis and Dertilis petitioned the court for their release, but at the same time time Ioannidis declared that he did not regret any of his actions. The Court of Justice in Piraeus declined his petition, based on his lack of remorse. In 2008, Ioannidis was transferred to the General State Hospital of Nikaia from Korydallos due to illness. Ioannidis died on 16 August 2010 from respiratory problems, having been taken to hospital the previous night. He remained incarcerated until his death.
Stylianos Pattakos, even in jail, exhibited continued devotion to Papadopoulos. It is reported that he enjoyed hearing religious music supplied to him by a monk and in his prison memoirs he describes how he enjoyed tending a small garden and a little pond with 21 goldfish. The two things he mentions in his writings that he did not like was noise pollution at the jail, which he describes as "torture", and that the shape of the pond and faucet combination looked like a hammer and sickle.
In another segment of his prison memoirs, Pattakos also mentions an incident involving General Odysseas Aggelis (the Chief of the Armed Forces under much of the junta), and a jail guard. According to Pattakos the jail guard had his radio volume high and Aggelis pleaded with the guard to lower it. The guard not only did not comply but raised the volume higher. Aggelis then asked Pattakos to intervene on his behalf and ask the "noble jail guard" again.
On 23 March 1987 Aggelis committed suicide in his cell, at the age of 75. Pattakos was released from jail in September 1990 due to "irreparable damage to his health".
Dertilis was the last remaining junta member in jail. He died 28 January 2013 at the age of 94.
Legacy.
The successful prosecution of the junta and the heavy sentences imposed on the junta principals sent a message to potential conspirators within the army ranks that the era of immunity from constitutional transgressions by the military was irreversibly over.
The EAT/ESA torture trials were acknowledged by Amnesty International as the first trials internationally, since the Nuremberg Trials, to involve prosecution of torture. The EAT/ESA trials are also among the very few trials of torturers in human history and are referred to as the "Criminals' Trials" by Amnesty International. Because it is rare for a country to prosecute torturers, these trials have become the subject of scientific research and papers have been published based on their court proceedings.
In 1977, Amnesty International published a report about the first torturers' trial in Greece with the dual purpose of documenting the use of torture in a modern oppressive regime and using it as an example of prosecution of officials who torture, based on a conviction that the Greek experience can benefit the rest of the world.
The trials of the junta also served to demystify the myth of the competent, professional, incorruptible and ethical military strongman. According to the books "The Politics of Human Rights: The Quest for Dignity" and "Transitional Justice: How Emerging Democracies Reckon With Former Regimes : Country Studies":

The Dancer's Body

"The Dancer's Body", a series of three documentary programmes exploring the science and the art of dance, was first broadcast by the BBC in 2002. The series was an experiment in "cross-genre" television production, intended to break down conventional barriers between the arts, medicine, science, factual and entertainment programming. It was presented by the former principal dancer of the Royal Ballet School in London, Deborah Bull, and won the International Dance Screen Award in the same year.
Recent developments in brain science, psychology, physical medicine and nutrition, and their relevance to dance, were combined with performances, by Deborah Bull and other dancers, of works specially commissioned for the series from leading choreographers, including David Bintley and Wayne McGregor.
Bull introduced an autobiographical element to the series by returning to Skegness, where, aged seven, she took her first lessons at the Janice Sutton School of Dance, in a room above what is now an amusement arcade on the town's High Street. One of Janice Sutton's current pupils, seven-year-old Rebecca Ellis, danced a simple routine to illustrate how the future prima ballerina might have performed at the same age.
The executive producer of the series was Ross MacGibbon; the series producer was Robert Eagle. The directors included Andy King-Dabbs, Diana Hill and Deborah May.

72d Air Refueling Squadron

The 72d Air Refueling Squadron (72 ARS) is a United States Air Force Reserve squadron, assigned to the 434th Operations Group, stationed at Grissom Joint Air Reserve Base, Indiana.
Overview.
The 72d Air Refueling Squadron's primary mission is to provide Global Reach by force extending through aerial refueling operations for the United States Military and its allies. Additionally the unit is tasked with aeromedical evacuation support, airlift, and passenger transport.
History.
Origins - World War II.
The 72d Air Refueling Squadron originated as the 72nd Troop Carrier Squadron on 3 January 1943. The squadron was activated on 9 February 1943 at Alliance Army Airfield, Nebraska assigned to the 434th Troop Carrier Group. In September 1943 equipped with C-47s, the unit moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana at Baer Field, which today is the Fort Wayne International Airport. Shortly thereafter the squadron deployed to the European theatre in support of the Allied Forces in World War II. During its World War II tour in the European Theater of Operations, the squadron staged out of Fullbeck, England, Aldermaston and finally out of Mourmelon-le-Grand, France. It participated in airborne assaults on Normandy, the Netherlands, and Germany and the relief of Bastogne. It was credited with participation in the Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe campaigns. It earned the Distinguished Unit Citation and French Croix de Guerre with Palm for its participation in the airborne assault on Normandy, and later earned the French Fourragere. In addition to the C-47, the squadron also flew Horsa gliders, as well as CG-4 gliders during the war. After the war the 72nd returned to Baer Field, IN in August 1945 and then back to Alliance Army Airfield in September 1945. In October 1945 the unit moved to George Field, Illinois, and finally in February 1946 it moved to Greenville AAB, SC where it was inactivated on 31 July 1946. On 1 August 1947 the unit was re-activated as the 72nd Troop Carrier Squadron in the Reserves at Baer Field, IN. It was assigned to the 434th Troop Carrier Group, equipped with C-47s.
Korean War - 1973.
In July 1949 the squadron and group moved to Atterbury AFB, IN, which today is the Columbus Indiana Municipal Airport, where they transitioned to the C-46. Starting in May 1951 as part of the Korean mobilization the unit served under Tactical Air Command's Eighteenth Air Force for the next 21 months where it supported Army paratroop training in Georgia. In addition the 72nd participated in Exercises Southern Pine and Long Horn, as well as conducting routine airlift and troop carrier missions for Tactical Air Command. The squadron returned to Atterbury AFB in February 1953. By 1957 Atterbury AFB had been renamed Bakalar AFB, and in the same year the 72nd converted to C-119 "Boxcars". In 1962 as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the squadron served for 32 days supporting the deployment of Air Force strategic and tactical resources to the Southeast corner of the country and their redeployment there from. 
In July 1969, wing, group, and squadron were re-designated as tactical air support units and were reequipped with U-3As and O-2As. On 31 December 1969, in connection with the closing of Bakalar AFB, the 434th Wing was inactivated and the 931st Group and its squadron moved to Grissom AFB, IN. First reassigned to the 403rd Composite Wing on 1 June 1970 and then on 15 January 1971 to the 434th Special Operations Wing, concurrently activated and collocated with group and squadron at Grissom. On 1 March 1971, group and squadron converted to A-37s and were re-designated as special operations units. On 15 September 1973, the 434th Special Ops Wing was re-designated as a tactical fighter wing. On 1 October 1973, the 72nd Special Operations Squadron was inactivated in favor of the 46th Tactical Fighter Squadron because at the time another 72nd Tactical Fighter Squadron existed.
Air Force Reserve - Desert Storm.
On 18 May 1977 the squadron was re-designated as the 72nd Air Refueling Squadron, Heavy, and was assigned to the Air Force Reserve. HQ Air Force Reserve officially activated the 72nd Air Refueling Squadron on 1 July 1978. In July 1987 the 434th Tactical Fighter Wing was re-designated as the 434th Air Refueling Wing of which the 72nd Air Refueling was a part. In 1990 the 72nd as part of the 434th were recalled to active duty for the Gulf War and helped to form one of the largest tanker task forces ever assembled operating out of western Saudi Arabia. The 72nd and its partners flew more than 7,000 refueling missions, offloading fuel to more than 25,000 coalition aircraft. In June 1992, the 434th Air Refueling Wing with its KC-135s and the 930th Fighter Group with its A-10s merged to form the first ever reserve composite wing to include the 72nd ARS and was designated the 434th Wing. In 1994 the A-10 squadron under the 434th inactivated and the 434th Wing reorganized as the 434th Air Refueling Wing once again.
Kosovo - Present.
During the 1990s the 72nd deployed personnel and aircraft numerous times to support "No Fly" operations in the Balkans, as well as Operations Northern and Southern Watch over Iraq. In May 1999, the 72nd and the 434th were activated to provide aerial refueling support to Operation Allied Force deployed out of Rhein Mein AB in Germany as part of the war in Kosovo. In September 2001, just days after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 the 72nd was activated for a year in support of the Global War on Terror. The squadron initially deployed to the Pacific theatre to help provide a western air bridge in preparation for the war in Afghanistan. Later during that year, the 72nd was deployed to a classified Southwest Asian location flying aerial refueling missions over Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf in support of the war. The unit's activation ended in late summer of 2002, but 6 months later in Feb of 2003 the 72nd was again activated for a six month stint in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Most of the unit staged out of Moron AB, Spain, with a smaller elements staging out of RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Although the unit's second activation supporting the Global War on Terror ended in late 2003, the 72nd continues to provide worldwide air refueling and air mobility support by flying missions for Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom.
Campaign Narrative.
The 72d participated in airborne assaults on Normandy, the Netherlands, and Germany, assisted in the relief of Bastogne, and conducted aerial transportation of passengers and cargo in the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The squadron performed troop carrier and transport duties from 1947–1969, forward air control training from 1969–1971, special operations training from 1971–1973, and worldwide air refueling missions since 1973. Personnel and aircraft deployed from the 72d to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, performing air refueling duties for allied forces from August 1990-March 1991 and periodically deployed since late 1993 to Italy and other western European locations in support of NATO operations over Bosnia.

1995–96 Australian region cyclone season

1995-1996 Australian region cyclone season was an active Australian cyclone season, with Western Australia experiencing a record number of landfalling intense storms in the Pilbara region. The season produced a total of 19 tropical cyclones, of which 14 developed into named storms and 9 reached severe tropical cyclone status. The strongest of the season was Severe Tropical Cyclone Olivia, which also produced the highest recorded wind gust on record of 408 km/h (253 mph). Though several systems impacted land, the general sparsity of population centres in Australia limits the scale of damage. One person was confirmed to have been killed and cumulative losses were estimated at A$77 million (US$58.5 million).
Storms.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Daryl-Agnielle.
The first storm of the year and most intense across the Southern Hemisphere during the 1995–96 seasons, Cyclone Daryl was first identified several hundred kilometres west of Sumatra on 16 November. Initially tracking south-eastward, the system gradually attained gale-force winds as it neared the Cocos Islands late on 17 November. Squally conditions and heavy rain impacted the islands but no damage took place. Low wind shear allowed for further strengthening; a mid-level ridge south of the system forced Daryl to turn towards the west. Early on 19 November, the storm intensified into a severe tropical cyclone and attained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) before crossing 90°E and entering the Mauritius area of responsibility. Upon crossing this border, Daryl was assigned a second name, Agnielle, by Mauritius. Over the following days, the system further deepened, peaking in strength as a Category 5 on the Australian intensity scale with 205 km/h (125 mph) and a barometric pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg). Steady weakening took place due to markedly stronger wind shear. Cyclone Daryl-Agnielle was last noted as a weak low pressure center on 25 November over the open waters of the southern Indian Ocean.
Tropical Cyclone Emma.
Emma stayed well off the Australian coast in the Indian Ocean. It spent most of its duration as a tropical low.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Frank.
It formed on 6 December 1995, and was the first cyclone to form in northwest coast of Australia during the 95/96 season. Cyclone Frank brought heavy winds and rains to the Pilbara coast. Frank was one of four cyclones to strike in that area.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Gertie.
A tropical low formed in the Timor Sea on 16 December and tracked westsouthwest as it deepened slowly. The low crossed into the WA region on 17 December and was named Gertie on the afternoon of the 18th. The cyclone then moved towards the southsouthwest during the 19th but slowed to be almost stationary during the late afternoon and evening of that day.
Gertie then began to move south, then southeastwards, crossing the coast near Mandora Station on 20 December. Gertie then passed to the northeast of Telfer producing near gale force winds and heavy rain before dissipating on the 21st. The storm did only minor damage.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Barry.
Barry formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria on 4 January, reaching a maximum intensity of Category 3 (Australian scale) before crossing the coast between Karumba and Kowanyama two days later. Heavy rains caused severe flooding across the southern Cape York Peninsula, however there were no deaths reported.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Hubert-Coryna.
Hubert stayed well off the Australian coast in the Indian Ocean from 8 to 12 January 1996.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Celeste.
Tropical Cyclone Celeste formed on 26 January and rapidly intensified into a Category 3 (Australian scale) system. The cyclone moved away from the coast after dumping heavy rain on the Central Coast. One man drowned in floodwaters near Bowen.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Jacob.
TC Jacob formed on 1 February 1996 from a monsoonal low that moved across the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region of Western Australia before tracking over the Bonaparte Gulf. It closely followed the Western Australian coast and developed cyclone characteristics near Adele Island. Jacob continued to intensify and moved westsouthwestwards, roughly parallel to the Pilbara coast. At peak intensity Jacob was a Category 3 storm with wind gusts near the centre estimated to be 200 kilometres per hour. The Kimberley and Pilbara coastal areas received heavy rains as the cyclone passed offshore. Only minor damage occurred and there were no deaths.
Tropical Cyclone Isobel.
Isobel only lasted from 27 January 1996 to 1 February in the Timor Sea and did not pass close to any land.
Tropical Storm 12P.
A weak storm formed near the edge of the Bureau's area of responsibility in early February. Only the JTWC classified it as a tropical cyclone, reporting peak winds of 65 km/h (40 mph).
Early February Tropical Low.
A tropical low existed from 8 February to 11 February.
Queen Elizabeth II Tropical Low.
A Queen Elizabeth II tropical low existed from 14 February to 17 February.
Tropical Cyclone Dennis.
Tropical Cyclone Dennis existed from 15 February to 18 February.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Kirsty.
A strong cyclone, Kirsty crossed the coast at Pardoo Station near Port Hedland on 12 March 1996. The cyclone did considerable damage to tourist cabins and other structures.
Tropical Cyclone Ethel.
Severe flooding triggered by Cyclone Ethel resulted in A$75 million (US$57 million).
Severe Tropical Cyclone Olivia.
Lasting from 5 April 1996 to 12 April, Olivia reached Category 4 and destroyed 55 houses (plus 27 damaged) at the mining town of Pannawonica. Several buildings also suffered roof damage at neighbouring Mount Tom Price. There were only 10 minor injuries. A gust of 267 km/h was recorded at Varanus Island which is the equal highest recorded wind gust in Australia. More recently, a review conducted by WMO confirmed a reported gust of 408 km/h on Barrow Island on 10 April 1996, at the peak of the storm, making it the highest gust ever recorded on earth during a non-tornadic storm.
Tropical Depression 27S.
Tropical Depression 27S existed from 12 April to 19 April.
Tropical Cyclone Jenna.
Tropical Cyclone Jenna existed from 30 April to 6 May.
Brisbane Tropical Low.
A tropical low existed in the vicinity of Brisbane from 30 April to 5 May.
Storm names.
Tropical cyclones are assigned names by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology or Papua New Guinea. Tropical cyclones are named if they are non-frontal low pressure systems of synoptic scale developing over warm waters, or if Dvorak intensity analysis indicate the presence of gale force or stronger winds near the centre. Therefore, tropical systems with gales in one or more quadrants, but not near the centre, are not named. All names assigned in the Australian region are selected sequentially. Only the names used during this cyclone season are listed below. The complete list of names for each basin are found in the World Meteorological Organization's official lists.
Each Australian Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane) maintained a list of names arranged alphabetically and alternating male and female. Tropical cyclones that develop in the South-East Indian Ocean are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Perth. This region includes the areas east of 90°E, south of the Equator, and west of 125°E. Tropical cyclones that develop south of the Equator between 125°E and 141°E are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Darwin, Northern Territory. This area includes most of the cyclones that form in the Arafura Sea and Western Gulf of Carpentaria. Tropical cyclones in the Coral Sea and Eastern Gulf of Carpentaria between 141°E and 160°E and south of 10°S are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane, Queensland.
Storms that enter the region that were named by the Mauritius meteorological service or the Fiji Meteorological Service retain their original names. However, those that move from the Australian region into the South-West Indian Ocean (west of 90°E) are renamed by Météo-France. Additionally, the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea reserves the right to name cyclones that develop in the Solomon Sea and Gulf of Papua, north of 10°S between 141°E and 160°E. Names issued by Port Moresby are retired after one use.
Darwin
Brisbane
Additionally, one storm, Jenna, was named the Mauritius meteorological service.
Retirement.
At the end of the season, the Bureau of Meteorology retired seven of the thirteen names used during the season. The names were Frank, Gertie, Kristy, Barry, Celeste, Ethel and Olivia.
