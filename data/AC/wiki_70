Metrosexual

Metrosexual is a neologism, derived from "metropolitan" and "heterosexual", coined in 1994 describing a man (especially one living in an urban, post-industrial, capitalist culture) who is especially meticulous about his grooming and appearance, typically spending a significant amount of time and money on shopping as part of this. The term is popularly thought to contrast heterosexuals who adopt fashions and lifestyles stereotypically associated with homosexuals, although, by definition given by the originator (see below), a metrosexual "might be officially gay, straight or bisexual."
Origin.
The term originated in an article by Mark Simpson published on November 15, 1994, in "The Independent". Simpson wrote:
However, it was not until the early 2000s when Simpson returned to the subject that the term became globally popular. 
In 2002, Salon.com published an article by Simpson, which identified David Beckham as the metrosexual poster boy and offered this updated, succinct definition:
The advertising agency Euro RSCG Worldwide adopted the term shortly thereafter for a marketing study. Sydney's daily newspaper, "The Sydney Morning Herald", ran a major feature in March 2003 titled "The Rise of the Metrosexual" (also syndicated in its sister paper "The Age") which borrowed heavily from Simpson's Salon.com piece (but failed to acknowledge this or mention Simpson). A couple of months later, the New York Times' Sunday Styles section ran a story, "Metrosexuals Come Out." The term and its connotations continued to roll steadily into more news outlets around the world.
Though it did represent a complex and gradual change in the shopping and self-presentation habits of both men and women, the idea of metrosexuality was often distilled in the media down to a few men—David Beckham, Sam Romano, and Brad Pitt were frequently mentioned—and a short checklist of vanities, like skin care products, scented candles and costly, colorful dress shirts and pricey designer jeans. It was this image of the metrosexual—that of a straight young man who got pedicures and facials, practiced aromatherapy and spent freely on clothes—that contributed to a backlash against the term from men who merely wanted to feel free to take more care with their appearance than had been the norm in the 1990s, when companies abandoned dress codes, Dockers khakis became a popular brand, and XL, or extra-large, became the one size that fit all.
A "60 Minutes" story on 1960s-70s pro footballer Joe Namath suggested he was "perhaps, America's first metrosexual" after filming his most famous ad sporting Beautymist pantyhose. Simpson has called Joe Namath "America's abandoned metrosexual prototype", leaving the field open for later Brit metro imports such as Beckham.
When the word first became popular, various sources incorrectly attributed its origin to trendspotter Marian Salzman, but by Salzman's own admission Simpson's 2002 Salon.com article was the original source for her usage of the word, which she had "updated, based on a more commercial take on the now".
Related terms.
Over the course of the following years, other terms countering or substituting for "metrosexual" appeared. Perhaps the most widely used was "retrosexual," which in its anti- or pre-metrosexual sense was also first used by Simpson. However, in later years the term was used by some to describe men who subscribed to what they affected to be the grooming and dress standards of a previous era, such as the handsome, impeccably turned-out fictional character of Donald Draper in the television series "Mad Men", itself set in an idealised version of the early 1960s New York advertising world.
Another example was the short-lived "übersexual", which was coined by marketing executives and authors of "The Future of Men", and was perhaps inspired by Simpson's use of the term "uber-metrosexual" to describe David Beckham.
Simpson has argued that from the beginning the appropriation of the metrosexual concept by American marketers such as Salzman in 2003 was always about trying to straighten men out. Simpson's original definition of the metrosexual was sexually ambiguous, or at least went beyond the straight/gay dichotomy. Marketers, in contrast, insisted that the metrosexual was always "straight" – they even tried to pretend that he was not vain. However, they failed to convince the public, hence, says Simpson, their attempt to create the uber-straight ubersexual.
Narcissism.
Narcissism, according to Simpson, plays a crucial role in the metrosexual concept. In his book "Male Impersonators", 1994 he explains why understanding narcissism is vital to understanding modern masculinity. Citing Freud's "On Narcissism", which analyzes the psychological aspect of narcissism and explains narcissistic love as follows:
Female metrosexuality.
Female metrosexuality is a concept that Mark Simpson explored with American writer Caroline Hagood. They employed the female characters from the HBO series "Sex and the City" in order to illustrate examples of "wo-metrosexuality", a term Hagood coined to refer to the feminine form of metrosexuality. The piece implied that, although this phenomenon would not necessarily empower women, the fact that the metrosexual lifestyle de-emphasizes traditional male and female gender roles could help women out in the long run. However, it is debatable whether the characters made famous by "Sex and the City" truly de-emphasized female gender roles, given that the series focused a high amount of attention on stereotypically feminine interests like clothing, appearance, and romantic entanglements.
Changing masculinity.
Traditional masculine norms, as described in Dr. Ronald F. Levant's "Masculinity Reconstructed" are: "avoidance of femininity; restricted emotions; sex disconnected from intimacy; pursuit of achievement and status; self-reliance; strength; and aggression; and homophobia."
Statistics, including market research by Euro RSCG, show that the pursuit of achievement and status is not as important to men as it used to be; and neither is, to a degree, the restriction of emotions or the disconnection of sex from intimacy. Another norm change is supported by research that claimed men "no longer find sexual freedom universally enthralling." The most important shift in masculinity is that there is less avoidance of femininity and the "emergence of a segment of men who have embraced customs and attitudes once deemed the province of women." What is accepted as "masculine" has shifted considerably throughout the times, so the modern concept of how a man "should be" differs from the ideal man of previous eras. Some styles and behaviors that are today considered masculine were, in the past, part of the woman's domain (e.g., knee britches, makeup, jewelry). 
Changes in culture and attitudes toward masculinity, visible in the media through television shows such as "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy", "Queer as Folk", and "Will & Grace", have changed these traditional masculine norms. Metrosexuals only made their appearance after cultural changes in the environment and changes in views on masculinity.
Simpson explains in his article "Metrosexual? That rings a bell..." that "Gay men provided the early prototype for metrosexuality. Decidedly single, definitely urban, dreadfully uncertain of their identity (hence the emphasis on pride and the susceptibility to the latest label) and socially emasculated, gay men pioneered the business of accessorising—and combining—masculinity and desirability."
But such probing analyses into various shoppers' psyches ignore other significant factors affecting men's shopping habits, foremost among them women's shopping habits. As the retail analyst Marshal Cohen explained in a 2005 article in the "New York Times" entitled, "Gay or Straight? Hard to Tell," the fact that women buy less of men's clothing than they used to has, more than any other factor, propelled men into stores to shop for themselves. "In 1985 only 25 percent of all men's apparel was bought by men, he said; 75 percent was bought by women for men. By 1998 men were buying 52 percent of apparel; in 2004 that number grew to 69 percent and shows no sign of slowing." One result of this shift was the revelation that men cared more about how they look than the women shopping for them had.
Men's fashion magazines – such as "Details", "Men's Vogue", and the defunct "Cargo" – target what one "Details" editor calls "men who moisturize and read a lot of magazines".
However despite changes in masculinity, research suggests men still feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising. Research by Martin and Gnoth (2009) found that feminine men preferred feminine models in private, but stated a preference for the traditional masculine models when their collective self was salient. In other words, feminine men endorsed traditional masculine models when they were concerned about being classified by other men as feminine. The authors suggested this result reflected the social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculine norms.
In popular culture.
In its soundbite diffusion through the channels of marketeers and popular media, who eagerly and constantly reminded their audience that the metrosexual was straight, the metrosexual has congealed into something more digestible for consumers: a heterosexual male who is in touch with his feminine side—he color-coordinates, cares deeply about exfoliation, and has perhaps manscaped.
Men did not go to shopping malls, so consumer culture promoted the idea of a sensitive man who went to malls, bought magazines and spent freely to improve his personal appearance. As Simpson put it:
This commercial vision is also adapted in television's metrosexual archetype, Bravo's "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy", in which the gay presenters instructively transform the appearance of the straight guy—but largely avoid dealing with his personality.
In contrast, there is also the view that metrosexuality is at least partly a naturally occurring phenomenon, much like the Aesthetic Movement of the 19th century and that the metrosexual is merely a modern incarnation of a dandy. Simpson has strongly rebutted attempts to suggest that metrosexual is 'just a dandy':
In 2011 Simpson published the ebook "Metrosexy - A 21st Century Self-Love Story", billed as 'A biography of the metrosexual. By his Dad'. It argues that the profound impact of metrosexuality on our ideas of masculinity and femininity and sexuality itself has been obscured by the media's effusive but largely 'skin-deep' coverage of it.

Tacking Point Lighthouse

Tacking Point Lighthouse is Australia's third oldest lighthouse. It was built on a rocky headland about 8 kilometres south of Port Macquarie in 1879 by Shepherd and Mortley, to a design by the New South Wales Colonial Architect, James Barnet. It is operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and is classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW).
Tacking Point was named by explorer Matthew Flinders in 1802 during his 1802–1803 circumnavigation of Australia. Its nearest lighthouses are Smoky Cape Lighthouse at South West Rocks, to the north, and Crowdy Head Light, to the south.
History.
In the mid-nineteenth century, there were few lights in the Tacking Point area and over 20 ships were wrecked. The first wrecks occurred in 1823 and were the schooner "Black Joe" and the steamer "Sumatra". Consequently, in 1879, a fixed catadioptric light of less than 1000 candelas was erected on Tacking Point. It was the fourth of five small navigational lighthouses built to a design by James Barnet. The other four lighthouses were Crowdy Head Light, Fingal Head Light, Richmond River Light and Clarence River Light (now demolished). Only two of these lighthouses, Tacking Point and Crowdy Head still have a storeroom attached.
The lighthouse was built of cement-rendered bricks and only needed to be 8 metres high due to the elevation of the site. In 1919, the light was converted from wick oil light to automatic acetylene operation, and was demanned in 1920. The light was converted to mains electricity in 1974. The foundations of the keeper's cottage are still visible.
Management of the lighthouse is shared by three government authorities: the New South Wales Department of Lands owns the lighthouse; Roads and Maritime Services (formerly NSW Maritime) operates the light; and the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council manages the site. Vandalism has been a problem in the early 2000s. Resolving the issue has been complicated by the split management.
Tourism.
The Lighthouse headland marks the end of the circa 9 km Coastal Walk from Town Beach to Lighthouse Beach being built by the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council. The lighthouse is also a popular site for whale watching. The area is used for surfing and there is a surf life-saving club at the neighbouring Lighthouse Beach.

Mankinholes

Mankinholes is a hamlet in the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale, in West Yorkshire, England. It is part of the Pennines, and its nearest town is Todmorden in Yorkshire. It has a YHA hostel, managed by the larger hostel at nearby Haworth. Mankinholes is the starting point for the popular trek up Stoodley Pike, "Pike" being a North-country term for a mountain or large hill. The hill is surmounted by a 120-foot high 19th-century obelisk, also known as "Stoodley Pike", commemorating the end of the Crimean War. 
Mankinholes was an early centre of Wesleyan Methodism. Groups met in farmhouses as early as the late 18th century and the first chapel was built in 1814. This was enlarged in 1870 and rebuilt in 1911. An adjacent Sunday School was built in 1833. Mankinholes Methodist Church closed on 1 July 1979, when the congregation joined with that of Lumbutts Methodist Church, situated midway between the villages of Mankinholes and Lumbutts. Mankinholes Sunday School building still stands and is now a private house, surrounded by a large graveyard. 
The "Top Brink" (formerly the "Dog and Partridge") pub, in the nearby village of Lumbutts, serves real ales.

Prison

A prison or jail is a facility in which individuals are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as a form of punishment. The most common use of prisons is as part of a criminal justice system, in which individuals officially charged with or convicted of crimes are confined to a jail or prison until they are either brought to trial to determine their guilt or complete the period of incarceration they were sentenced to after being found guilty at their trial. Outside of their use for punishing civil crimes, authoritarian regimes also frequently use prisons and jails as tools of political repression to punish political crimes, often without trial or other legal due process; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice. In times of war or conflict, prisoners of war may also be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps, and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps.
History.
Punishment in Ancient times.
The start of prisons can be traced back to the rise of the state as a form of social organization. Corresponding with the advent of the state was the development of written language, which enabled the creation of formalized legal codes as official guidelines for society. The most well known of these early legal codes is the Code of Hammurabi, written in Babylon around 1750 BC. The penalties for violations of the laws in Hammurabi's Code were almost exclusively centered around the concept of "lex talionis" ("the law of retaliation") where people were punished as a form of vengeance, often by the victims themselves. This notion of punishment as vengeance or retaliation can also be found in many other legal codes from early civilizations, including the ancient Sumerian codes, the Indian "Manama Dharma Astra", the "Hermes Trismegistus" of Egypt, and the Mosaic Code.
Some Ancient Greek philosophers, such as Plato, began to develop ideas of using punishment to reform offenders instead of simply using it as retribution. Imprisonment as a penalty was used initially for those who could not afford to pay their fines. Eventually, since impoverished Athenians could not pay their fines, leading to indefinite periods of imprisonment, time limits were set instead. The prison in Ancient Athens was known as the "desmoterion" ("place of chains").
The Romans were among the first to use prisons as a form of punishment, rather than simply for detention. A variety of existing structures were used to house prisoners, such as metal cages, basements of public buildings, and quarries. One of the most notable Roman prisons was the Mamertine Prison, established around 640 B.C. by Ancus Marcius. The Mamertime Prison was located within a sewer system beneath ancient Rome, and contained a large network of dungeons where prisoners were held in squalid conditions, contaminated with human waste. Forced labor on public works projects was also a common form of punishment. In many cases, citizens were sentenced to slavery, often in ergastula (a primitive form of prison where unruly slaves were chained to workbenches and performed hard labor).
The Middle Ages.
During the Middle Ages in Europe, castles, fortresses, and the basements of public buildings were often used as makeshift prisons. The possession of the right and the capability to imprison citizens, however, granted an air of legitimacy to officials at all levels of government, from kings to regional courts to city councils; and the ability to have someone imprisoned or killed served as a signifier of who in society possessed power or authority over others. Another common punishment was sentencing people to galley slavery where they were chained together in the bottoms of ships and forced to row on naval or merchant vessels.
However, the concept of the modern prison largely remained unknown until the early 19th-century. Punishment usually consisted of physical forms of punishment, including capital punishment, mutilation and whipping, and non-physical punishments, such as public shaming rituals like the stocks.
Modern era.
During the 18th century, popular resistance to public execution and torture became more widespread both in Europe and in the United States, and rulers began looking for means to punish and control their subjects in a way that did not cause people to associate them with spectacles of tyrannical and sadistic violence. They began to look towards developing systems of mass incarceration as a solution. The prison reform movement that arose at this time this time was heavily influenced by two somewhat contradictory philosophies. The first was based in Enlightenment ideas of utilitarianism and rationalism, and suggested that prisons should simply be used as a more effective substitute for the punishments inflicted in public corporal punishments such as whipping, hanging, etc. This theory, often referred to as "deterrence", claims that the primary purpose of prisons is to be so harsh and terrifying that they deter people from committing crime out of fear of going to prison. The second theory, which saw prisons as a form of "rehabilitation" or "moral reform", was based out of religious ideas that equated crime with sin, and saw prisons as a place to instruct prisoners in Christian morality, obedience and proper behavior. These later reformers believed that prisons could be constructed as humane institutions of moral instruction, and that prisoners' behavior could be "corrected" so that when they were released, they would be model members of society.
Penal colonies and prison ships.
Penal transportation of convicted criminals to penal colonies in the British Empire - in the Americas from the 1610s to the 1770s and in Australia between 1788 and 1868 - was often offered as an alternative to the death penalty, which could be imposed for many offenses.
France also sent criminals to tropical penal colonies including Louisiana in the early 18th century. Penal colonies in French Guiana operated until 1951, such as the infamous "Île du Diable" (Devil's Island). Katorga prisons were harsh work camps established in the 17th century in Russia in remote underpopulated areas of Siberia and the Russian Far East that had few towns or food sources. Siberia quickly gained its fearful connotation of punishment.
Jails contained both felons and debtors - the latter were allowed to bring in wives and children. The jailer made his money by charging the inmates for food and drink and legal services and the whole system was corrupt. One reform of the seventeenth century had been the establishment of the "London Bridewell" as a house of correction for women and children. This was the only place any medical services were provided.
As the practice of penal transportation was steadily curtailed in England at the end of the 18th century, a popular alternative emerged. Old sailing vessels, which came to be called "hulks", were used as places of temporary confinement. Although conditions on these ships were often appalling, their use set a precedent and persuaded many people that mass incarceration and labour was a viable method of crime prevention and punishment. The turn of the 19th century would see the first organised prison reform movement, and by the 1810s the first state prisons and correction facilities were established, thereby inaugurating the modern prison system as we know it today.
The prison reform movement.
John Howard was one of the most notable early prison reformers. After having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, in his capacity as high sheriff of Bedfordshire, he published "The State of the Prisons" in 1777. He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they couldn't pay the jailer's fees. He proposed wide ranging reforms to the system, including that each prisoner should be in a separate cell, that staff should be professional and paid by the government, that outside inspection of prisons should be imposed, and that prisoners should be provided with a healthy diet and reasonable living conditions. The prison reform charity, the Howard League for Penal Reform was established in his honour.
Following Howard's agitation, the Penitentiary Act was passed in 1779. This introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. However, these were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished.
Quakers were prominent in campaigning and publicizing the dire state of the prisons at the time. Elizabeth Fry documented the conditions that prevailed at Newgate prison, where the ladies' section was overcrowded with women and children, some of whom had not even received a trial. They did their own cooking and washing in the small cells in which they slept on straw. In 1816 she was able to found a prison school for the children who were imprisoned with their parents. She began a system of supervision and required the women to sew and to read the Bible. In 1817 she helped found the Association for the Reformation of the Female Prisoners in Newgate.
The development of the modern prison.
The theory of the modern prison system was born in London, influenced by the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham. Bentham's panopticon introduced the principle of observation and control that underpins the design of the modern prison. The notion of prisoners being incarcerated as part of their punishment and not simply as a holding state until trial or hanging, was at the time revolutionary. His views influenced the establishment of the first prisons used as criminal rehabilitation centers. At a time when the implementation of capital punishment for a variety of relatively trivial offences was on the decline, the notion of incarceration as a form of punishment and correction held great appeal to reform-minded thinkers and politicians.
The first state prison in England was the Millbank Prison, established in 1816 with a capacity for just under 1000 inmates. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted the disciplinary system advocated by the SIPD. By the 1840s, penal transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was on the decline, and the Surveyor-General of convict prisons, Joshua Jebb, set an ambitious program of prison building in the country, with one large prison opening per year. Pentonville prison opened in 1842, beginning a trend of ever increasing incarceration rates and the use of prison as the primary form of crime punishment. Robert Peel's Gaols Act of 1823 introduced regular visits to prisoners by chaplains, provided for the payment of jailers and prohibited the use of irons and manacles.
In 1786, the state of Pennsylvania passed a law which mandated that all convicts who had not been sentenced to death would be placed in penal servitude to do public works projects such as building roads, forts, and mines. Besides the economic benefits of providing a free source of hard labor, the proponents of the new penal code also thought that this would deter criminal activity by making a conspicuous public example of consequences of breaking the law. However, what actually ended up happening was frequent spectacles of disorderly conduct by the convict work crews, and the generation of sympathetic feelings from the citizens who witnessed the mistreatment of the convicts. The laws quickly drew criticism from a humanitarian perspective (as cruel, exploitative and degrading) and from a utilitarian perspective (as failing to deter crime and delegitimizing the state in the eyes of the public). Reformers such as Benjamin Rush came up with a solution that would enable the continued used of forced labor, while keeping disorderly conduct and abuse out of the eyes of the public. They suggested that prisoners be sent to secluded "houses of repentance" where they would be subjected (out of the view of the public) to "bodily pain, labour, watchfulness, solitude, and silence ... joined with cleanliness and a simple diet".
Pennsylvania soon put this theory into practice, and turned its old jail at Walnut Street in Philadelphia into a state prison, in 1790. This prison was modeled on what became known as the "Pennsylvania system" (or "separate system"), and placed all prisoners into solitary cells with nothing other than religious literature, and forced them to be completely silent to reflect on their wrongs. New York soon built the Newgate state prison in Greenwich Village, which was modeled on the Pennsylvania system, and other states followed.
But by 1820 faith in the efficacy of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect on the level of crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes. In response, New York developed the Auburn system in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at Auburn State Prison and Sing Sing at Ossining. The aim of this was rehabilitative: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving as a model for the family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the U.S. to see the prisons included de Tocqueville who wrote "Democracy in America" as a result of his visit.
The use of prisons in Continental Europe was never as popular as it became in the English-speaking world, although state prison systems were largely in place by the end of the 19th century in most European countries. After the unification of Italy in 1861, the government reformed the repressive and arbitrary prison system they inherited, and modernized and secularized criminal punishment by emphasizing discipline and deterrence. Italy developed an advanced penology under the leadership of Cesare Lombroso (1835–1909).
Prison design.
Security.
Prisons are normally surrounded by fencing, walls, earthworks, geographical features, or other barriers to prevent escape. Multiple barriers, concertina wire, electrified fencing, secured and defensible main gates, armed guard towers, security lighting, motion sensors, dogs and roving patrols may all also be present depending on the level of security.
Remotely controlled doors, CCTV monitoring, alarms, cages, restraints, nonlethal and lethal weapons, riot-control gear and physical segregation of units and prisoners may all also be present within a prison to monitor and control the movement and activity of prisoners within the facility.
Modern prison designs have increasingly sought to restrict and control the movement of prisoners throughout the facility and also to allow a smaller prison staff to monitor prisoners directly; often using a decentralized "podular" layout. (In comparison, 19th-century prisons had large landings and cell blocks which permitted only intermittent observation of prisoners.) Smaller, separate and self-contained housing units known as "pods" or "modules" are designed to hold 16 to 50 prisoners and are arranged around exercise yards or support facilities in a decentralized "campus" pattern. A small number of prison officers, sometimes a single officer, supervise each pod. The pods contain tiers of cells arranged around a central control station or desk from which a single officer can monitor all the cells and the entire pod, control cell doors and communicate with the rest of the prison.
Pods may be designed for high-security "indirect supervision", in which officers in segregated and sealed control booths monitor smaller numbers of prisoners confined to their cells. An alternative is "direct supervision", in which officers work within the pod and directly interact with and supervise prisoners, who may spend the day outside their cells in a central "dayroom" on the floor of the pod. Movement in or out of the pod to and from exercise yards, work assignments or medical appointments can be restricted to individual pods at designated times and is generally centrally controlled. Goods and services, such as meals, laundry, commissary, educational materials, religious services and medical care can increasingly be brought to individual pods or cells as well.
Inmate security classifications.
Generally, when an inmate arrives at a prison, they go through a security classification screening and risk assessment that determines where they will be placed within the prison system. Classifications are assigned by assessing the prisoner's personal history and criminal record, and through subjective determinations made by intake personnel (which include mental health workers, counselors, prison unit managers, and others). This process will have a major impact on the prisoner's experience, determining their security level, educational and work programs, mental health status (e.g. will they be placed in a mental health unit), and many other factors. This sorting of prisoners is one of the fundamental techniques through which the prison administration maintains control over the inmate population, and creates an orderly and secure prison environment.
The levels of security within a prison system are categorized differently around the world, but tend to follow a distinct pattern. At one end of the spectrum are the most secure facilities ("maximum security"), which typically hold prisoners that are considered dangerous, disruptive or likely to try to escape. Furthermore, in recent times, supermax prisons have been created where the custody level goes beyond maximum security for people such as terrorists or political prisoners deemed a threat to national security, and inmates from other prisons who have a history of violent or other disruptive behavior in prison or are suspected of gang affiliation. These inmates have individual cells and are kept in lockdown, often for more than 23 hours per day. Meals are served through "chuck holes" in the cell door, and each inmate is allotted one hour of outdoor exercise per day, alone. They are normally permitted no contact with other inmates and are under constant surveillance via closed-circuit television cameras.
On the other end are "minimum security" prisons which are most often used to house those for whom more stringent security is deemed unnecessary. For example, while white-collar crime rarely results in incarceration, when it does offenders are almost always sent to minimum-security prisons due to cultural perceptions of wealthier, more educated people as being less threatening. Lower-security prisons are often designed with less restrictive features, confining prisoners at night in smaller locked dormitories or even cottage or cabin-like housing while permitting them freer movement around the grounds to work or activities during the day. Some countries (such as Britain) also have "open" prisons where prisoners are allowed home-leave or part-time employment outside of the prison. Suomenlinna Island facility in Finland is an example of one such "open" correctional facility. The prison has been open since 1971 and, as of September 2013, the facility's 95 male prisoners leave the prison grounds on a daily basis to work in the corresponding township or commute to the mainland for either work or study. Prisoners can rent flat-screen televisions, sound systems, and mini-refrigerators with the prison-labor wages that they can earn—wages range between 4.10 and 7.3 Euros per hour (US$5.30 to $9.50). With electronic monitoring, prisoners are also allowed to visit their families in Helsinki and eat together with the prison staff. Prisoners in Scandinavian facilities are permitted to wear their own clothes.
Common facilities.
Modern prisons often hold hundreds or thousands of inmates, and must have facilities onsite to meet most of their needs, including dietary, health, fitness, education, religious practices, entertainment, and many others. Conditions in prisons vary widely around the world, and the types of facilities within prisons depend on many intersecting factors including funding, legal requirements, and cultural beliefs/practices. Nevertheless, in addition to the cell blocks that contain the prisoners, also there are certain auxiliary facilities that are common in prisons throughout the world.
Kitchen / Dining.
Prisons generally have to provide food for a large number of individuals, and thus are generally equipped with a large institutional kitchen. There are many security considerations, however, that are unique to the prison dining environment. For instance, cutlery equipment must be very carefully monitored and accounted for at all times, and the layout of prison kitchens must be designed in a way that allows staff to observe activity of the kitchen staff (which are usually prisoners). The quality of kitchen equipment varies from prison to prison, depending on when the prison was constructed, and the level of funding available to procure new equipment. Prisoners are often served food in a large cafeteria with rows of tables and benches that are securely attached to the floor. However, inmates that are locked in control units, or prisons that are on "lockdown" (where prisoners are made to remain in their cells all day) have trays of food brought to their cells.
Health care.
Prisons in wealthy, industrialized nations provide medical care for most of their inmates. Additionally, prison medical staff play a major role in monitoring, organizing, and controlling the prison population through the use of psychiatric evaluations and interventions (psychiatric drugs, isolation in mental health units, etc). Prison populations are largely from poor minority communities that experience greater rates of chronic illness, substance abuse, and mental illness than the general population. This leads to a high demand for medical services, and in countries such as the US that don't provide free healthcare, prison is often the first place that people are able to receive medical treatment (which they couldn't afford outside).
Prison medical facilities include primary care, mental health services, dental care, substance abuse treatment, and other forms of specialized care, depending on the needs of the inmate population. Health care services in many prisons have long been criticized as inadequate, underfunded, and understaffed, and many prisoners have experienced abuse and mistreatment at the hands of prison medical staff who are entrusted with their care.
Library and educational facilities.
Some prisons provide educational programs for inmates that can include basic literacy, secondary education, or even college education. Prisoners seek education for a variety of reasons, including the development of skills for after release, personal enrichment and curiosity, finding something to fill their time, or trying to please prison staff (which can often secure early release for good behavior). However, the educational needs of prisoners often come into conflict with the security concerns of prison staff and with a public that wants to be "tough on crime" (and thus supports denying prisoners access to education). Whatever their reasons for participating in educational programs, prison populations tend to have very low literacy rates and lack of basic mathematical skills, and many have not completed secondary education. This lack of basic education severely limits their employment opportunities outside of prison, leading to high rates of recidivism, and research has shown that prison education can play a significant role in help prisoners reorient their lives and become successful after reentry.
Many prisons also provide a library where prisoners can check out books, or do legal research for their cases. Often these libraries are very small, consisting of a few shelves of books. In some countries, such as the United States, drastic budget cuts have resulted in many prison libraries being shut down. Meanwhile, many nations that have historically lacked prison libraries are starting to develop them. Prison libraries can dramatically improve the quality of life for prisoners, who have large amounts of empty time on their hands that can be occupied with reading. This time spent reading has a variety of benefits including improved literacy, ability to understand rules and regulations (leading to improved behavior), ability to read books that encourage self-reflection and analysis of one's emotional state, consciousness of important real-world events, and education that can lead to successful re-entry into society after release.
Recreation and fitness.
Many prisons provide limited recreational and fitness facilities for prisoners. The provision of these services is controversial, with certain elements of society claiming that prisons are being "soft" on inmates, and others claiming that it is cruel and dehumanizing to confine people for years without any recreational opportunities. The tension between these two opinions, coupled with lack of funding, leads to a large variety of different recreational procedures at different prisons. Prison administrators, however, generally find the provision of recreational opportunities to be useful at maintaining order in the prisons, because it keeps prisoners occupied and provides leverage to gain compliance (by depriving prisoners of recreation as punishment). Examples of common facilities/programs that are available in some prisons are: gyms and weightlifting rooms, arts and crafts, games (such as cards, chess, or bingo), television sets, and sports teams. Additionally, many prisons have an outdoor recreation area, commonly referred to as an "exercise yard". 
Control/segregation units.
A control unit or segregation unit (also called a 'block' or 'isolation cell') is a highly secure area of the prison, where inmates are placed in solitary confinement to isolate them from the general population. Other prisoners that are often segregated from the general population include those who are in protective custody, or who are on suicide watch.
Other facilities.
In addition to the above facilities, others that are common include prison factories and workshops, visiting areas, mail rooms, telephone and computer rooms, a prison store (often called a "canteen") where prisoners can purchase goods, or a death row where prisoners who have been sentenced to death await execution.
Special types of prison.
Youth detention facilities.
Prisons for juveniles are known by a variety of names, including "youth detention facilities", "juvenile detention centers", and "reformatories". The idea of separately treating youthful and adult offenders is a relatively modern idea. The earliest known use of the term "juvenile delinquency" was in London in 1816, from where it quickly spread to the United States. The first juvenile correctional institution in the United States opened in 1825 in New York City. By 1917, juvenile courts had been established in all but 3 states. It was estimated that in 2011 more than 95,000 juveniles were locked up in prisons and jails in the United States (the largest youth prisoner population in the world). Besides prisons, many other types of residential placement exist within juvenile justice systems, including youth homes, community-based programs, training schools and boot camps.
Like adult facilities, youth detention centers in some countries are experiencing overcrowding due to large increases in incarceration rates of young offenders. Crowding can create extremely dangerous environments in juvenile detention centers and juvenile correctional facilities. Overcrowding may also lead to the decrease in availability to provide the youth with much needed and promised programs and services while they are in the facility. Many times the administration is not prepared to handle the large number of residents and therefore the facilities can become unstable and create instability in simple logistics.
In addition to overcrowding, juvenile prisons are questioned for their overall effectiveness in rehabilitating youth. Many critics note high juvenile recidivism rates, and the fact that the most of the youths that are incarcerated are those from lower socio-economic classes (who often suffer from broken families, lack of educational/job opportunities, and violence in their communities).
Women's prisons.
Female inmates experience high rates of rape and sexual violence while incarcerated. Research documents numerous cases in which women are at a significantly higher risk than men for being sexually abused before and during prison. Sexual aggression and abuse by male prison staff is widespread. In the United States, “in 2008 to recent Bureau of Justice Statistics, more than 216,600 people were sexually abused in prisons and jails…overall, that’s almost six hundred people a day- twenty-five an hour”. The majority of women incarcerated experience abuse before prison and while incarcerated and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Sexual offenses against women prisoners can include rape, assault, and groping during pat frisks. Male correctional officials often violate women prisoners’ privacy by watching them undress, shower, and go to the bathroom. Research suggests that, “women with histories of abuse are more likely to accept sexual misconduct from prison staff because they are already conditioned to respond to coercion and threats by acquiescing to protect themselves from further violence”. “In federal women’s correction facilities, 70% of guards are male,” reinforcing female inmates’ powerlessness.
Most inmates are women of colour from low socioeconomic backgrounds and therefore suffer from both chronic diseases that are common in minorities (such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension) and health problems that may result from living in poverty (such as malnutrition, etc.). Incarcerated women suffer disproportionately from HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, reproductive issues, and chronic diseases. Within the American prison system, HIV became more prevalent among women than among men. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, from 1991 to 1998 the number of women prisoners with HIV increased by 69%, while the equivalent figure among male prisoners decreased by 22% during the same time period. The New York State Department of Health stated in 1999 that women entering New York state prisons had twice as high of an HIV rate as men entering New York state prisons. At the end of the year 2000 women in U.S. state prison systems had a 60% higher likelihood of carrying HIV than men in American state prison systems.
The needs of mothers during of pregnancy and childbirth often conflict with the demands of the prison system. “In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics stated that, on average, 5% of women who enter into state prisons are pregnant and in jails 6% of women are pregnant”. Very few of these women receive prenatal care, which can be very detrimental to both the mother and child, especially when coupled with inmates’ histories of inadequate health care as well as sexual, physical and substance abuse. Most of these pregnancies are deemed as high risk. Additionally, a lack of maternity clothes and resources to deal with premature births, false labors, and miscarriages pose serious challenges to prisoners. Furthermore, incarcerated women are a source of free labor for private companies. It is recorded that if women decline to work, then their medicinal needs are not fulfilled. This becomes a major issue for pregnant women who may not physically be able to work but are in dire need of medical care. Most pregnant women are shackled on grounds of security in labor and delivery. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals established that is unconstitutional in 2009, and prohibited restraint of women during labor.
Military prisons and prisoner-of-war camps.
Prisons have formed part of military systems since the French Revolution. France set up its system in 1796. They were modernized in 1852, they are used variously to house prisoners of war, unlawful combatants, those whose freedom is deemed a national security risk by military or civilian authorities, and members of the military found guilty of a serious crime. Military prisons in the United States have also been converted to civilian prisons, to include Alcatraz Island. Alcatraz was formerly a military prison for soldiers during the American Civil War.
In the American Revolution, British prisoners held by the U.S. were assigned to local farmers as laborers. The British kept American sailors in broken down ship hulks with high death rates.
In the Napoleonic wars, the broken down hulks were still in use for naval prisoners. One French surgeon recalled his captivity in Spain, where scurvy, diarrhea, dysentery, and typhus abounded, and prisoners died by the thousands:
In the American Civil War, at first prisoners of war were released, after they promised not to fight again unless formally exchanged. When the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners the system broke down, and each side built large-scale POW camps. Conditions in terms of housing, food and medical care were bad in the Confederacy, and the Union retaliated by imposing harsh conditions.
By 1900 the legal framework of the Geneva and Hague Convention provided considerable protection. In the First World War, millions of prisoners were held on both sides, with no major atrocities. Officers received privileged treatment. There was an increase in the use of forced labor throughout Europe. Food and medical treatment were generally comparable to what active duty soldiers received, and housing was much better than front-line conditions.
Political prisons and administrative detention.
Political prisoners are people who have been imprisoned because of their political beliefs, activities and affiliations. There is much debate about who qualifies as a "political prisoner". The category of "political prisoner" is often contested, and many regimes that incarcerate political prisoners often claim that they are merely "criminals". Others who are sometimes classified as "political prisoners" include prisoners who were politicized in prison, and are subsequently punished for their involvement with political causes.
Many countries maintain or have in the past had a system of prisons specifically intended for political prisoners. In some countries, dissidents can be detained, tortured, executed, and/or "disappeared" without trial. This can happen either legally, or extralegally (sometimes by falsely accusing people and fabricating evidence against them).
"Administrative detention" is a classification of prisons or detention centers where people are held without trial.
Psychiatric facilities.
Some psychiatric facilities have characteristics of prisons, particularly when confining patients who have committed a crime and are considered dangerous. In addition, many prisons have psychiatric units dedicated to housing offenders diagnosed with a wide variety of mental disorders. The United States government refers to psychiatric prisons as "Federal Medical Centers (FMC)".
Population statistics.
As of 2010, it is estimated that at least 10.1 million people are currently imprisoned worldwide.
As of 2012, the United States has the world's largest prison population, with over 2 million people in American prisons or jails—up from 744,000 in 1985. That same year, it was also reported that the United States government spent an estimated US$37 billion to maintain these prisons. In 2012, the United States prison population was estimated at over 2.3 million prisoners, meaning 1 in every 100 American adults are in a prison. The cost of these prisons was then estimated at US$74 billion per year.
As of 2009, California's 158,000 inmates were detained in prisons that were designed to hold 84,000—almost 14,000 of these inmates were sleeping in very tight spaces, or in hallways, or on floors. People are also being incarcerated at an increasing rate and new prisons cannot be built fast enough. In 2009 China's prison population was about 1.6 million, while the prison population of India was 332,112.
A mid-November 2013 news report announced that four prisons in Sweden were closed during the year due to a significant drop in the number of inmates. The decrease in the number of Swedish prisoners was considered "out-of-the-ordinary" by the head of Sweden's prison and probation services, with prison numbers in Sweden falling by around 1% a year since 2004. Prisons were closed in the towns of Åby, Håja, Båtshagen, and Kristianstad.
Economics of the prison industry.
In the United States alone, more than $70 billion per year is spent on prisons, with over 800,000 people employed in the prison industry. As the prison population grows, revenues increase for a variety of small and large businesses that construct facilities, and provide equipment (security systems, furniture, clothing), and services (transportation, communications, healthcare, food) for prisons. These parties have a strong interest in the expansion of the prison system since their development and prosperity directly depends on the number of inmates.
The prison industry also includes private businesses that benefit from the exploitation of the prison labor. The prison industry blurs the lines between free and coerced labor. Some scholars, using the term "prison industrial complex", have argued that the trend of "hiring out prisoners" is a continuation of the slavery tradition, pointing out that the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution freed slaves but allowed forced labor for people convicted of crimes. Prisons are very attractive to employers, because prisoners can be made to perform a great array of jobs, under conditions that most free laborers wouldn't accept (and would be illegal outside of prisons): sub-minimum wage payments, no insurance, no collective bargaining, lack of alternative options, etc. Prison labor can soon deprive the free labor of jobs in a number of sectors, since the organized labor turns out to be uncompetitive compared to the prison counterpart.
Social effects of mass incarceration.
Mass incarceration has an powerful negative influence on communities (particularly poor communities of color), creating broken families, economic disenfranchisement, and increases in criminal activity. In many poor neighborhoods in the U.S., as many as one fifth of the adult men are in prison at any given time. When they are released, they are unable to find work, earn less money when they do find work, and experience a wide range of medical and psychological issues that make it harder for them to integrate back into society. Because of the lack of opportunities for former prisoners, rates of recidivism are very high. This dynamic affects not only the individuals who are incarcerated, but the families and communties around them, who have to pick up the burden while they are away (e.g. mothers who have to work and raise their children alone, because the father is imprisoned or teachers who have to deal with disciplinary problems from children who are acting out due to broken families). Furthermore, spending billions of dollars every year on prisons often results in funding shortages for social welfare programs like schools, food aid, and healthcare, which address the poverty that fuels much of the criminal activity in many poor communities.
As a result of the ineffectiveness of prisons at preventing crime, the high costs of maintaining them, and the detrimental socio-economic effects of mass incarceration, many nations (e.g. Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands) have been working towards policies of large-scale decarceration, addressing crime and violence with alternative strategies such as fines, community service, and restorative justice processes.
Theories of punishment and criminality.
A variety of justifications and explanations are put forth for why people are imprisoned by the state. The most common of these are:
Alternatives to Incarceration.
Conditional sentences are sentences that are served outside of the prison walls and in the community with some sort of restrictions or conditions placed on the offender, in an effort to reduce prison populations. The requirements or conditions may include mandatory programs such as a drug or alcohol treatment seminars, curfews, house arrest, or electronic monitoring. Most offenders who receive conditional sentences are low risk and are usually serving time for impaired driving where no death occurred. When an offender receives a conditional sentence of home confinement in comparison to incarceration, the offender is still able to see family members, maintain a normal job, and attend school. This is a huge advantage to conditional sentencing, since offenders are not completely cut off from the external world. Although the offender is not locked away in a prison cell, the offender is still expected to stay at home during certain times of the day or night. In order to verify that offenders are abiding by the restrictions placed on them, electronic monitoring is often used. The development of GPS, which allows law enforcement agencies to know the exact location of the offender by the use of satellites, has increased the effectiveness of offenders serving home confinement sentences drastically. Offenders can now easily be identified and tracked down through the use of GPS allowing law enforcement officers to quickly move in to make an arrest when an offender is in breach of their conditions.
The prison abolition movement seeks to reduce or eliminate prisons and the prison system, and replace them with more humane and effective systems. It is distinct from prison reform, which is the attempt to improve conditions inside prisons; however, relying on prisons less can significantly improve their conditions by eliminating overcrowding. Abolitionists criticize the focus on "crime" as violations of laws that are arbitrarily defined by those in power—especially when these lawmakers are seen as oppressive and corrupt. Abolitionists see most anti-social acts (violence, theft, etc.) as the result of social problems (e.g. poverty, racism, sexism) that cannot be dealt with by simply punishing individuals, and instead require systemic changes to address the underlying structural causes.
Restorative justice is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of the victims and the offenders, as well as the involved community, instead of focusing on satisfying abstract legal principles or punishing offenders (such as imprisoning them). Victims take an active role in the process, while offenders are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, "to repair the harm they've done—by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service".

Macaulay Cup

The MacAulay Association Camanachd Cup is a trophy in the Scottish sport of shinty. It is competed for by the eight highest-placed league teams from the north and south areas of Scotland at the end of the previous season. The first winner of the cup, in 1947, was Newtonmore. It will be sponsored by Artemis from the 2010 season.[http://skye-camanachd.sitekit.net/default.aspx.locid-087new1ej.Lang-EN.htm] It is one of the five trophies considered to be part of the Grand Slam in the sport of shinty.
The current holders are Kyles Athletic.
History.
The trophy was first presented in 1947 by Flora Macaulay, then editor of "The Oban Times" newspaper. The competition, uniquely in the sport is run outwith the auspices of the Camanachd Association, being administered by the Macaulay Association which also runs a junior six a-side competition before the final.
The final is played in Oban every year. It was the first ever summer tournament when shinty had a winter season, before the switch to summer play in 2004. In 2006, worries about the fixture list being overcrowded led to the proposal of the Macaulay Cup becoming a match between the winners of the Mactavish Cup and the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup. The Macaulay Association withdrew the cup from competition but the reintroduction of the competition in 2007 sparked debate about its place in the sport.[http://bounci.tv/forums/p/282/1104.aspx#1104]
Inveraray won the cup 3-0 against Newtonmore on August 23, 2008. The game was televised live on BBC2. Inveraray again won the cup in 2009 coming back from 3-0 down to win the game 4-3 with a last minute goal by Grant Griffin.
Kingussie stopped Inveraray's attempt at a third consecutive title with a 4-2 win after extra time on 21 August 2010 thanks to 4 goals from Ronald Ross.[http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/Shinty-Kingussie-4--3.6487844.jp]
The top 8 in the south for 2012 was affected by Ballachulish's decision to drop a league, they were the eighth best team in the south (not counting Lochside Rovers) in 2011. 
The 2012 final was played between Oban and Glenurquhart. Glen defeated Oban 6-0. In the aftermath of the final, the trophy was broken during celebrations.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-19330119

Shaving oil

Shaving oil is normally a vegetable oil, blend of vegetable oils or siloxanes with essential oils that can be used as a stand-alone shaving lubricant or as pre-shave underneath shaving cream, soap or gel, to facilitate the shaving of facial and other body hair. Often these products would work best by wetting the area before the razor being used.
Animal fats and vegetable oils might have been used as shaving lubricant since the practice of shaving began. While not as commonly used as traditional foams (creams) and gels the use of shave oils is growing in popularity, largely due to their greater protection, razor glide-enabling and moisturizing properties, and because shave oils can be made without the addition of toxic chemical ingredients. Shave oils can also assist in making the shave smoother and closer and they may provide a less irritating shave for users.
Shaving oil manufacturers and users list many advantages to using shave oils including but not limited to:
According to some sources, vegetable oils like coconut oil or olive oil can be used as shaving oil.

<doc id="19008500" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19008500" title="Near-death experience">
Near-death experience

A near-death experience (NDE) refers to personal experiences associated with impending death, encompassing multiple possible sensations including detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth, the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of a light. These phenomena are usually reported after an individual has been pronounced clinically dead or has been very close to death. With recent developments in cardiac resuscitation techniques, the number of reported NDEs has increased. The experiences have been hypothesized in medical journals as having the characteristics of hallucinations, while parapsychologists and a number of scientists have pointed to them as evidence of an afterlife and mind-body dualism. Religious believers tend to be divided on and uncertain about their interpretation of NDEs, given that while they verify some aspects of the faiths, they also explicitly falsify other aspects. According to the 2013 PLOS ONE article by Thonnard et al., "near-death experiences cannot be considered as imagined event memories. On the contrary, their physiological origins could lead them to be really perceived although not lived in the reality."
Popular interest in near-death experiences was initially sparked by Weiss's 1972 "The Vestibule," followed by Raymond Moody's 1975 book "Life After Life" and the founding of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) in 1981. According to a Gallup poll, approximately eight million Americans claim to have had a near-death experience. Some commentators, such as Simpson, claim that the number of near-death experiencers may be underestimated. People who have had a near-death experience may not be comfortable discussing the experience with others, potentially due in part to some seeing an NDE as a paranormal experience. NDEs are among the phenomena studied in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and hospital medicine.
Characteristics.
The earliest accounts of NDE can be traced to the Myth of Er, recorded in the 4th century BC by Plato's "The Republic" (10.614-10.621), wherein Plato describes a soldier telling of his near-death experiences.
The cognate French term "expérience de mort imminente" (experience of imminent death) was proposed by the French psychologist and epistemologist Victor Egger as a result of discussions in the 1890s among philosophers and psychologists concerning climbers' stories of the panoramic life review during falls. In 1968 Celia Green published an analysis of 400 first-hand accounts of out-of-body experiences. This represented the first attempt to provide a taxonomy of such experiences, viewed simply as anomalous perceptual experiences, or hallucinations. These experiences were popularized with the work of psychiatrist Raymond Moody in 1975 as the Near-Death Experience (NDE). It is uncertain if Moody was aware of the expression earlier used by Egger.
Researchers have identified the common elements that define near-death experiences. Bruce Greyson argues that the general features of the experience include impressions of being outside one's physical body, visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, and transcendence of egotic and spatiotemporal boundaries. Many different elements have been reported, though the exact elements tend to correspond with the cultural, philosophical, or religious beliefs of the person experiencing it:
The traits of a classic NDE are as follows:
Kenneth Ring (1980) subdivided the NDE on a five-stage continuum. The subdivisions were:
He stated that 60% experienced stage 1 (feelings of peace and contentment), but only 10% experienced stage 5 ("entering the light").
Clinical circumstances associated with near-death experiences include cardiac arrest in myocardial infarction (clinical death); shock in postpartum loss of blood or in perioperative complications; septic or anaphylactic shock; electrocution; coma resulting from traumatic brain damage; intracerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction; attempted suicide; near-drowning or asphyxia; apnea; and serious depression. In contrast to common belief, Kenneth Ring argues that attempted suicides do not lead more often to unpleasant NDEs than unintended near-death situations.
The distressing aspects of some NDEs are discussed more closely by Greyson and Bush.
Cultural variances.
Karlis Osis and his colleague Erlendur Haraldsson argued that the content of near death experiences does not vary by culture, except for the identity of the figures seen during the experiences. For example, a Christian may see Jesus, while a Hindu may see Yamaraja, the Hindu king of death. However, Yoshi Hata and his team reported NDEs with substantially different contents than those described above.
NDE variants.
Some NDEs have elements that bear little resemblance to the "typical" near-death experience. Anywhere from one percent (according to a 1982 Gallup poll) to 20 percent ) of subjects may have distressing experiences and feel terrified or uneasy as various parts of the NDE occur, they visit or view dark and depressing areas or are accosted by what seem to be hostile or oppositional forces or presences. Persons having bad experiences were not marked by more religiosity or suicidal background. According to one study (Greyson 2006) there is little association between NDEs and prior psychiatric treatment, prior suicidal behavior, or family history of suicidal behavior. There was also little association between NDEs and religiosity, or prior brushes with death, suggesting the occurrence of NDEs is not influenced by psycopathology, by religious denomination or religiosity, or by experiencers' prior expectations of a pleasant dying process or continued postmortem existence. Greyson (2007) also found that the long term recall of NDE incidents was stable and did not change due to embellishment over time.
Bush (2012), a counselor, and board member and former Executive Director to the International Association for Near-Death Studies, holds that not all negative NDE accounts are reported by people with a religious background. Suicide attempters, who should be expected to have a higher rate of psychopathology according to Greyson (1991) did not show much difference from non-suicides in the frequency of NDEs. Bush (2012), holds that frightening NDEs have been ignored too long, in favor of only positive reports: "In fact, because contemporary metaphysical thought has so strongly emphasized the belief (or certainly the hope) that only the light is real and has value, it has by and large denied or ignored the 'dark night' aspects of spirituality."
Negative or distressing Near Death Experiences.
Lindley, Bryan and Conley (1981) in a study of 55 near-death encounters found eleven (20 percent) to be "partially negative or Hellish." They defined a "negative" near death experience as one that contains extreme fear, panic or anger. It may also contain descriptions of demonic creatures or embittered human-like voices that mock or taunt the subjects. Such negatives may only form part of the overall NDE incident. Margot Grey's study of NDEs in England (Grey 1985) reports that distressing experiences tend to follow 5 phases: fear and panic, out of body experience, entering a black void, sensing an evil force and entering a hellish environment. These 5 phases parallel the more typical "standard" NDEs of peace, out of body experience, tunnel travel, seeing the light, and entrance to the paradise environment. Distressing experiences were more likely to be reported shortly after the NDE incident than the positive experiences.
Grey's comparative study of British and American near-death experiencers indicates that negative features, while a small minority, definitely exist. Typical negative experiences described by subjects include feelings of panic, anguish, desperation, intense loneliness and desolation. Subjects described environments as either dark and gloomy or barren and hostile; some subjects reported being on the brink of a pit or abyss, or sensing evil or malevolent forces or creatures. Such environments were sometimes conceived of by subjects as intensely hot or cold and often included sounds of despair or mourning. Atwater (1988) also noted patterns parallel to peaceful NDEs in her study including lifeless apparitions, barren expanses, threats or silence, a seeming danger of violence, a sense of hell and coldness. Flynn (1986) notes a general pattern to distressing experiences in which evil or darkness is experienced as a distinct dimension or entity separate from the positively experienced light. Atwater (1992) reports that only adults in her sample experienced distressing NDEs, not children.
Three patterns of distressing NDEs. Greyson and Bush's (2013) analysis of 50 distressing NDEs, report the following 3 patterns:
Moral dimensions of distressing NDEs. A number of writers on Near Death Experiences identify a dark zone or "void" in association with negative or malignant spiritual beings, or a zone of despair, depression or despondency connected with the actions persons have committed in earthly life or their moral character. These negative elements may not be isolated but may blend with other standard NDE features. NDers who have viewed a "dark" void of depressed or trapped "souls" for example, may still go on to have a Life Review, feeling of warmth and love, and other such elements. The Life Review NDE accounts detail is usually a time of searching exposure and affirmation, having moral implications that the NDE traveler had to confront, including his or her actions and the negative or positive impact they had on others. Some New Age writers like Edgar Cacye and Emmanuel Swedenborg also identify a dark or negative area brought about by the dead person's own behavior, state or obsessions in their earthly physical life. According to Swedenborg: "All who are in the Hells are in evils and in falsities therefrom derived from the loves of self and of the world" (n. 551-565).
This aspect of the Life Review is sometimes described as humbling with inward character, thoughts and outward actions laid bare, and the subject invited to examine how wrong (or right) they were through the eyes of the Divine/Light Being, and how others were affected. While the exposure was felt as distressing in some aspects, the Review is generally in a larger context of being unconditionally loved, though regret and guilt may be experienced. NDErs under the full moral exposure of the Review almost always agreed with the Divine Being as to rightness or wrongness of their actions, as seen through the Being's moral perspective, and the rightness of that perspective. The Being of Light or others may later make clear to the NDE that they are in a temporary transitional not permanent state and must choose to "go back" or "stay". Sometimes the NDEr is told that a "work" or life must be completed. The final moral destiny or fate of the "returning" NDEr is thus pushed back to some future time.
In the 1990s a literature on distressing near-death experiences emerged. One cardiologist (Maurice Rawlins) describes a patient fading in and out of consciousness screaming "I am in hell." The patient later described near-death phenomena but without recalling the hellish aspect. Both doctor and patient were transformed by the experience, each becoming religious. Medical patients appear more likely to forget such frightening experiences than pleasant ones, or may be more reluctant to share negative self-images and memories than positive ones with researchers. According to one study of NDEs- most contemporary near-death experiencers recount that they, not the Light Being perform the moral judgment, their own consciences holding them accountable. The "Figure of Light" serves to provide the standard of judgment. A recurring theme in Life Reviews is that each person is responsible for every thought, word and deed of his or her life. Bush (2012) holds that the notion of being prepared may apply if consciousness is not strictly in the human brain:
Distressing NDE patterns and outcomes. Rommer (2001) found that NDE suicide attempters made up 55% of people in her research who reported a Type II Eternal Void experience, 18% who reported a Type III Hellish experience, and most of those who reported a Type IV Negative Judgment experience, but cautions against jumping to conclusions about suicides since some suicide NDEs are pleasurable, and the emotional turmoil surrounding the suicide event, and/or guilt or fear about the negative consequences for suicides on the other side may play a part in influencing the pattern of these experiences. NDErs who experience distressing experiences may often turn around their lives in a positive way, or attempt to do so. Rommer 2001 suggests that distressing NDERs almost always come to see their experiences as blessings in disguise. Bush (2002) holds that "returning" NDERs have a more mixed pattern of post-event edjustment- with those who interpret the experience as a warning to correct previous behaviors healing most quickly and thoroughly. Others may attempt to dismiss the experience as less valid than pleasurable NDEs, or may take a long view, sometimes lasting years, to draw lessons and conclusions from the NDE experience.
Shared NDEs and NDE messages.
Shared NDEs There have been a few reports of "shared NDEs", in which someone connected to the dying person accompanies them on their out-of-body journey. This might take the form of a dream that occurs at the same time that the subject was near death. Children have also been the subjects of NDEs. Very young children tend to report surreal experiences that have some common NDE elements. As children get older, their religious teachings often color their NDEs with more spiritual connotations, such as meeting God or Jesus.
Prophetic messages to NDEsrs
A small percentage of NDE subjects report a prophetic vision that reveals to them the fate of earth and humanity. This is generally an apocalyptic vision showing the end times, but some report visions of humanity evolving into higher beings. 
Although some claim to have specific forecasts such as the time of a big natural disaster, most NDers who allege messages or prophecies do not proffer specific information on future world events, save in a general way: such as warning mankind that it is accountable on the other side, a vague coming period of war and chaos, or to turn from environmental destruction or mistreatment of one another, or the vast new realm of light and love beyond physical death. Some prophecies are of a personal nature, such as children that will be born in the future, or the pending death of a relative. Other prophecies are limited to the personal testimony of the NDE, as to the felt reality of the experience, the future of light and hope, or the ethical, moral or religious lessons to be drawn, rather than sweeping claims as to specific future historical incidents.
Messages said to be given sometimes occur during the Life Review, where the NDEer is given a detailed "playback" exposing all thoughts, actions and motives and their impact, as seen through the moral and spiritual lens of the Being of Light. The personal future or outcome of the temporary NDE sourjorner is sometimes left ambiguous. A Life Review may confirm personal safety, protection or salvation upon future death, or may leave the future open until the normal termination of earthly life. Some NDE travelers may conceive of Life Reviews as a "reprieve" or a "second chance" to put things right in their lives, before they cross over the other side of death, since all actions and thoughts are to be accountable there. NDErs generally are changed by their experience, becoming less ego-centric, more empathetic, and having less interest in status symbols and material possessions.
Research.
Because the study of NDEs is a topic that addressed multiple possible feelings, sensations and their origins, research on NDE should be conducted primarily by researchers with credentials in cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscience addresses the questions of how psychological functions (for example, human feelings and sensations) are produced by neural circuitry (including the human brain). Modern contributions to the research on near-death experiences, however, have come from several academic disciplines that generally do not include neuroscience. There are multiple reasons for this trend. For example, brain activity scans are not typically performed when a patient is undergoing attempts at emergency resuscitation. Claiming that there is no measurable brain activity without having a variety of different EEG, catSCAN, FMRI, etc. is not considered a good scientific practice. Existing research is mainly in the disciplines of medicine, psychology and psychiatry. Heightened brain activity has been recorded in experimental rats directly following cardiac arrest though there has been no similar research in humans.
Individual cases of NDEs in literature have been identified into ancient times. In the 19th century a few efforts moved beyond studying individual cases - one privately done by Mormons and one in Switzerland. Up to 2005, 95% of world cultures have been documented making some mention of NDEs.
Contemporary interest in this field of study was originally spurred by the writings of Jess Weiss (popular literature author), Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (psychiatrist), George Ritchie (psychiatrist), and Raymond Moody Jr. (psychologist and M.D.). Moody's book "Life After Life", which was released in 1975, brought public attention to the topic of NDEs. This was soon to be followed by the establishment of the International Association for Near-death Studies (IANDS) in 1981. IANDS is an international organization that encourages scientific research and education on the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual nature and ramifications of near-death experiences. Among its publications are the peer-reviewed "Journal of Near-Death Studies" and the quarterly newsletter "Vital Signs".
Bruce Greyson (psychiatrist), Kenneth Ring (psychologist), and Michael Sabom (cardiologist), helped to launch the field of Near-Death Studies and introduced the study of near-death experiences to the academic setting. From 1975 to 2005, some 2500 self reported individuals in the US had been reviewed in retrospective studies of the phenomena with an additional 600 outside the US in the West, and 70 in Asia. Prospective studies, reviewing groups of individuals and then finding who had an NDE after some time and costing more to do, had identified 270 individuals. In all close to 3500 individual cases between 1975 and 2005 had been reviewed in one or another study. And all these studies were carried out by some 55 researchers or teams of researchers. The medical community has been reluctant to address the phenomenon of NDEs, and grant money for research has been scarce. Nevertheless, both Greyson and Ring developed tools usable in a clinical setting. Major contributions to the field include Ring's construction of a "Weighted Core Experience Index" to measure the depth of the near-death experience, and Greyson's construction of the "Near-death experience scale" to differentiate between subjects that are more or less likely to have experienced an NDE. The latter scale is also, according to its author, clinically useful in differentiating NDEs from organic brain syndromes and nonspecific stress responses. The NDE-scale was later found to fit the Rasch rating scale model. Greyson has also brought attention to the near-death experience as a focus of clinical attention, while Melvin Morse, head of the Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, and colleagues have investigated near-death experiences in a pediatric population.
Neurobiological factors in the experience have been investigated by researchers in the field of medical science and psychiatry. Among the researchers and commentators who tend to emphasize a naturalistic and neurological base for the experience are the British psychologist Susan Blackmore (1993), with her "dying brain hypothesis", and the founding publisher of "Skeptic" magazine, Michael Shermer (1998). More recently, cognitive neuroscientists Jason Braithwaite (2008) and Olaf Blanke (2009) from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland have published accounts presenting evidence for the brain-based nature of near death experiences.
In September 2008, it was announced that 25 U.K. and U.S. hospitals would examine near-death studies in 1,500 heart attack patient-survivors. The three-year study, coordinated by Sam Parnia at Southampton University, hopes to determine if people without heartbeat or brain activity can have an out-of-body experience with veridical visual perceptions. This study follows on from an earlier 18-month pilot project. On a July 28, 2010 interview about a recent lecture at Goldsmiths, Parnia (internal medicine physician by training with specialty in pulmonology, critical care, and sleep medicine) asserts that "evidence is now suggesting that mental and cognitive processes may continue for a period of time after a death has started" and describes the process of death as "essentially a global stroke of the brain. Therefore like any stroke process one would not expect the entity of mind / consciousness to be lost immediately". He also expresses his disagreement with the term 'near death experiences' because "the patients that we study are not near death, they have actually died and moreover it conjures up a lot of imprecise scientific notions, due to the fact that itself is a very imprecise term".
Researcher Lakhmir Chawla, an Associate Professor of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and Medicine at George Washington University medical centre in Washington D.C. argues that near-death experiences are caused by a surge of electrical activity as the brain runs out of oxygen before death. Levels were similar to those seen in fully conscious people, even though blood pressure was so low as to be undetectable, and could generate vivid images and feelings. The gradual loss of brain activity had occurred in the approximate hour before death, and was interrupted by a brief spurt of action, lasting from 30 seconds to three minutes. Sam Parnia disputed this explanation, claiming that Lakhmir Chawla had not provided proof that the electrical surges he recorded were linked to near-death experiences, saying: "Since all the patients died, we cannot tell what they were experiencing".
The top peer-reviewed journals in neuroscience, such as Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Brain Research Reviews, Biological Psychiatry, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience are generally not publishing research on NDEs. Among the scientific and academic journals that have published, or are regularly publishing, new research on the subject of NDEs are "Journal of Near-Death Studies", "Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease", "British Journal of Psychology", "American Journal of Disease of Children", "Resuscitation", "The Lancet", "Death Studies", and the "Journal of Advanced Nursing". Some researchers have complained about the resistance of the scientific establishment to the implications of NDEs.
Variance in NDE studies.
The prevalence of NDEs has been variable in the studies that have been performed. According to the Gallup and Proctor survey in 1980-1981, of a representative sample of the American population, data showed that 15% had an NDE. Knoblauch in 2001 performed a more selective study in Germany and found that 4% of the sample population had an NDE. The information gathered from these studies may nevertheless be subject to the broad timeframe and location of the investigation.
Perera et al., in 2005, conducted a telephone survey of a representative sample of the Australian population, as part of the Roy Morgan Catibus Survey, and concluded that 8.9% of the population had an NDE. In a more clinical setting, van Lommel et al. (2001), a cardiologist from Netherlands, studied a group of patients who had suffered cardiac arrests and who were successfully revived. They found that 62 patients (18%) had an NDE, of whom 41 (12%, or 66% of those who had an NDE) described a core experience.
According to Martens the only satisfying method to address the NDE-issue would be an international multicentric data collection within the framework for standardized reporting of cardiac arrest events. The use of cardiac-arrest criteria as a basis for NDE research has been a common approach among the European branch of the research field.
Biological analysis and theories.
The first formal neurobiological model for NDE was presented in 1987 by Chilean scientists Juan Sebastián Gómez-Jeria (who holds a PhD in Molecular Physical Chemistry) and Juan Carlos Saavedra-Aguilar (M.D.) from the University of Chile. In the 1990s, Rick Strassman conducted research on the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine (DMT) at the University of New Mexico. Strassman advanced the theory that a massive release of DMT from the pineal gland prior to death or near-death was the cause of the near-death experience phenomenon. Only two of his test subjects reported NDE-like aural or visual hallucinations, although many reported feeling as though they had entered a state similar to the classical NDE. His explanation for this was the possible lack of panic involved in the clinical setting and possible dosage differences between those administered and those encountered in actual NDE cases. All subjects in the study were also very experienced users of DMT and/or other psychedelic/entheogenic agents. Some speculators consider that if subjects without prior knowledge on the effects of DMT had been used during the experiment, more volunteers would have reported NDE. Critics have argued that neurobiological models often fail to explain NDEs that result from close brushes with death, where the brain does not actually suffer physical trauma, such as a near-miss automobile accident. Such events may however have neurobiological effects caused by stress.
Whether or not these experiences are hallucinatory, they have a profound impact on the observer. Many psychologists not necessarily pursuing the paranormal, such as Susan Blackmore, have recognized this, and seek its biological cause.
According to Engmann (medical doctor), near-death experiences of people who are clinically dead are psychopathological symptoms caused by a severe malfunction of the brain resulting from the cessation of cerebral blood circulation. An important question is whether it is possible to "translate" the bloomy experiences of the reanimated survivors into psychopathologically basic phenomena, e.g. acoasms, central narrowing of the visual field, autoscopia, visual hallucinations, activation of limbic and memory structures according to Moody's stages. The symptoms suppose a primary affliction of the occipital and temporal cortices under clinical death. This basis could be congruent with the thesis of pathoclisis—the inclination of special parts of the brain to be the first to be damaged in case of disease, lack of oxygen, or malnutrition—established eighty years ago by Cécile and Oskar Vogt. According to that thesis, the basic phenomena should be similar in all patients with near-death experiences. But a crucial problem is to distinguish these basic psychopathological symptoms from the secondary mental associated experiences which may result from a reprocessing of the basic symptoms under the influence of the person's cultural and religious views.
Research released in 2010 by University of Maribor, Slovenia had put near-death experiences down to high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood altering the chemical balance of the brain and tricking it into 'seeing' things. Of the 52 patients, 11 reported NDEs. Neuropsychiatrist Peter Fenwick of the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London responded to this study with "in cardiac arrests, everybody has high CO2 but only 10 percent have NDEs," and "What's more, in heart attack patients, Fenwick said, "there is no coherent cerebral activity which could support consciousness, let alone an experience with the clarity of an NDE."
An article by Dutch cardiologist Pim van Lommel et al., argues, "With a purely physiological explanation such as cerebral anoxia for the experience, most patients who have been clinically dead should report one." Accordingly, a lack of predictable experiences should cast doubt on wholesale explanations of NDEs. According to Southampton University researcher Sam Parnia (critical care doctor), "Death starts when the heart stops beating, but we can intervene and bring people back to life, sometimes even after three to four hours when they are kept very cold. It could be that a far higher proportion of people have near-death experiences but don't remember them."
Psychologist Christopher C. French has summarized psychological and organic theories that provide an existing scientific explanation for NDEs. Psychological include the proposal that the NDE is a dissociative defense mechanism that occurs in times of extreme danger. A wide range of organic theories of the NDE has been put forward including those based upon cerebral hypoxia, anoxia, and hypercarbia; endorphins and other neurotransmitters; and abnormal activity in the temporal lobes. NDE subjects have increased activity in the left temporal lobe. In an experiment with one patient, electrical stimulation at the left temporoparietal junction lead to an illusion of another person close to her.
A 2012 study led by neuroradiologist Renemane reached the conclusion that the NDE is considered as a state of unconsciousness resembling of oneiroid syndrome.
REM state.
It is suggested that the extreme stress caused by a life threatening situation triggers brain states similar to REM sleep and that part of the near death experience is a state similar to dreaming while awake. People who have experienced times when their brains behaved as if they were dreaming while awake are more likely to develop the near death experience.
Lucid dreaming.
Some sleep researchers, such as Timothy J. Green, Lynne Levitan and Stephen LaBerge, have noted that NDE experiences are similar to many reported of lucid dreaming, in which the individual realizes he is in a dream. Often these states are so realistic as to be barely distinguishable from reality.
In a study of fourteen lucid dreamers performed in 1991, people who perform wake-initiated lucid dreams (WILD) reported experiences consistent with aspects of out-of-body experiences such as floating above their beds and the feeling of leaving their bodies. Due to the phenomenological overlap between lucid dreams, near-death experiences, and out-of-body experiences, researchers say they believe a protocol could be developed to induce a lucid dream similar to a near-death experience in the laboratory.
Other similarities include seeing oneself from the outside (an out of body experience), floating or flying, heightened awareness, and feelings of joy or peace. Some researchers believe this is caused when the mind is deprived of the majority of its senses and relies on the expectational processing. In this regard one experiences what one would expect to happen in their current circumstance. This could explain experiences caused by mental trauma such as a near miss accident in which the mind may close itself off at least partially to the senses and ones caused by physical trauma in which again the mind closes itself off to the world. At present, there exists no clear physiological or psychological basis for any relationship between lucid dreaming and NDEs.
Computational psychology.
Modeling of NDEs by S. L. Thaler in 1993 using artificial neural networks has shown that many aspects of the core near-death experience can be achieved through simulated neuron death. In the course of such simulations, the essential features of the NDE—life review, novel scenarios (i.e., heaven or hell), and OBE—are observed through the generation of confabulations or false memories, as discussed in Confabulation (neural networks). The key feature contributing to the generation of such confabulatory states are a neural network's inability to differentiate dead from silent neurons. Memories, whether related to direct experience, or not, can be seeded upon arrays of such inactive brain cells.
Van Lommel studies.
The first clinical study of near-death experiences (NDEs) in cardiac arrest patients was by Pim van Lommel, a cardiologist from the Netherlands, and his team ("The Lancet", 2001). Of 344 patients who were successfully resuscitated after suffering cardiac arrest, 62 (18%) expressed an intraoperative memory and among these, 41 (12%) experienced core NDEs, which included out-of-body experiences. According to Lommel, the patients remembered details of their conditions during their cardiac arrest despite being clinically dead with flatlined brain stem activity. Van Lommel concluded that his findings supported the theory that consciousness continued despite lack of neuronal activity in the brain. Van Lommel conjectured that continuity of consciousness may be achievable if the brain acted as a receiver for the information generated by memories and consciousness, which existed independently of the brain, just as radio, television and internet information existed independently of the instruments that received it.
Van Lommel et al., reported that 62 of the 344 patients with cardiac arrest reported some recollection. Of these 62, 50% reported an awareness or sense of being dead, 24% said that they had had an out-of-body experience, 31% recalled moving through a tunnel, whilst 32% described meeting with deceased people. Moreover, while near-death experiencers commonly report feelings of peace and bliss, only 56% associated the experience with such positive emotions. No patients reported a distressing or frightening NDE.
Effects.
NDEs are also associated with changes in personality and outlook on life. Kenneth Ring (professor of psychology) has identified a consistent set of value and belief changes associated with people who have had a near-death experience. Among these changes one finds a greater appreciation for life, higher self-esteem, greater compassion for others, a heightened sense of purpose and self-understanding, desire to learn, elevated spirituality, greater ecological sensitivity and planetary concern, and a feeling of being more intuitive. Changes may also include increased physical sensitivity; diminished tolerance of light, alcohol, and drugs; a feeling that the brain has been "altered" to encompass more; and a feeling that one is now using the "whole brain" rather than a small part. However, not all after-effects are beneficial and Greyson describes circumstances where changes in attitudes and behavior can lead to psychosocial and psychospiritual problems. Often the problems are those of the adjustment to ordinary life in the wake of the NDE.
Afterlife viewpoints.
NDE as proof that consciousness can function outside the brain.
Many view the NDE as the precursor to an afterlife experience, claiming that the NDE cannot be adequately explained by physiological or psychological causes, and that the phenomenon demonstrates that human consciousness can function independently of brain activity. Many NDE-accounts seem to include elements which, according to several theorists, can only be explained by an out-of-body consciousness. Michael Sabom reports a woman who underwent surgery for an aneurysm, and who reported an out-of-body experience that she claimed continued through a brief period of the absence of any EEG activity. Critics point out that no memories could be formed during the period of no EEG activity so it's not surprising that any discontinuity in the experience would be not be remembered. In another account, from a prospective Dutch NDE study, a nurse removed the dentures of an unconscious heart attack victim, and was identified by him as the one who removed them, although the patient was in a coma and undergoing cardio-pulmonary resuscitation at the time. After the patient was resuscitated, he also identified a drawer where the nurse had placed the dentures despite the fact that the nurse had forgotten. Some studies indicate that children's NDEs also differ in that they are more likely to include a visitation by a deceased pet or other animal, or relatives whom they once knew, or do not know had ever existed, including deceased relatives who died before they were born. Children were also much less likely to have a Life Review, but consistently claim to have encountered favorably disposed or comforting luminous beings, a Being of Light, or being in the presence of Light, or some other transcendental force or entity.
NDE as proof of the concept of afterlife.
Many individuals who experience an NDE see it as a verification of the existence of an afterlife. There are examples of ex-atheists, such as the Reverend Howard Storm, adopting a more spiritual viewpoint after their NDEs. Storm's NDE may also be characterized as a distressing near-death experience.
Jeffrey Long, a scientist practicing the specialty of radiation oncology, has claimed after his own study that life does indeed unequivocally exist after death, arguing that medicine simply cannot account for the consistencies in the accounts reported by people all over the world having experiences, which he cites as "generally lucid" and "highly organized", and saying that his work is an important step toward bringing science and religion together. Likewise, some individuals who do not experience an NDE after cardiac arrest lost interest in spirituality, although their fear of death also decreased. Both processes, like most of the psychological transformations associated with a close brush with death, take place over several years.
Greyson claims that: "No one physiological or psychological model by itself explains all the common features of NDE. The paradoxical occurrence of heightened, lucid awareness and logical thought processes during a period of impaired cerebral perfusion raises particular perplexing questions for our current understanding of consciousness and its relation to brain function. A clear sensorium and complex perceptual processes during a period of apparent clinical death challenge the concept that consciousness is localized exclusively in the brain."
A recent non-peer reviewed study by Sam Parnia suggests that such patients are "effectively dead", having no neural activity of those necessary for dreaming or hallucination; additionally, to rule out the possibility that near-death experiences resulted from lack of oxygen, Parnia rigorously monitored the concentrations thereof in the patients’ blood, and found that none of those who underwent the experiences had low levels of oxygen. He was also able to rule out claims that unusual combinations of drugs were to blame because the resuscitation procedure was the same in every case, regardless of whether they had a near-death experience or not. According to Parnia, "Arch sceptics will always attack our work. I’m content with that. That’s how science progresses. What is clear is that something profound is happening. The mind – the thing that is ‘you’ – your ‘soul’ if you will - carries on after conventional science says it should have drifted into nothingness."
After personally experiencing an NDE, formerly agnostic neurosurgeon Dr. Eben Alexander became convinced of the existence of the spiritual, describing his experiences as "too real to be real" and despite initially attempting to interpret his experience as a brain function, argues that his experiences could not have been a hallucination, due to the fact that the parts of the brain needed to produce such experiences were non-functional. However, Belgian neurologist Dr. Steven Laureys disagrees, stating in his study that: "Many individuals having had NDEs were not physically in danger of death suggesting that the perception, on its own, of the risk of death seems to be important in eliciting NDEs."
A few people feel that research on NDEs occurring in the blind can be interpreted to support an argument that consciousness survives bodily death. Kenneth Ring claims in the book "Mindsight: Near-Death and Out-of-Body Experiences in the Blind" that up to 80% of his sample studied reported some visual awareness during their NDE or out of body experience.
The karmic or purgatorial-like nature of a life review experienced by those who have had an NDE has so far not received a convincing scientific explanation. According to IANDS, near-death experiencers often have a life review, where they re-view or see every moment of their lives. During the life review, the near-death experiencer (NDEr) fully experiences being every other person with whom they have interacted. The NDEr feels what it was like to be on the receiving end of their actions, including those that caused others pain, as well as those that caused others joy.
Cross-cultural research.
Recent research into afterlife conceptions across cultures by religious studies scholar Gregory Shushan analyzes the afterlife beliefs of five ancient civilizations (Old and Middle Kingdom Egypt, Sumerian and Old Babylonian Mesopotamia, Vedic India, pre-Buddhist China, and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica) in light of historical and contemporary reports of near-death experiences, and shamanic afterlife "journeys". It was found that despite numerous culture-specific differences, the nine most frequently recurring NDE elements also recur on a general structural level cross-culturally, as if to suggest that the authors of these ancient religious texts were familiar with NDE or similar. Cross-cultural similarity, however, can be used to support both religious and physiological theories, for both rely on demonstrating that the phenomenon is universal. Others dispute in favor of cultural similarities; and others suggest that the experience is essentially universal, but altered in detail by cultural bias.
Criticism of NDE as proof for afterlife or consciousness outside the brain.
Skeptics argue that what some scientists regard as NDEs is based on the false deduction that the brain of a patient is inactive, while no proper brain activity scans have been performed. They view NDEs as poorly studied biological and chemical phenomena occurring in the brain. They argue that NDE could possibly be explained by purely physiological and neurobiological mechanisms that could be better understood through advances in neuroimaging and neuroscience in general.
There are three arguments in support of such criticism. First, the NDE could just as easily have occurred before or after any state resembling brain death. There is no way to verify the timing of memory formation relative to brain scans when the patient is not conscious. Second, it is very difficult to verify that there was in fact no measurable brain activity. There are many types of brain activity and they require different types of tests to verify them. Most of these types of tests are not typically performed when a patient is undergoing attempts at emergency resuscitation. It is entirely possible, for example, that a patient showing no activity on an EEG scan could still have brain activity that would appear on an FMRI, PET, or catSCAN. In the words of Dr. Mark Cohen, a neuroimaging researcher at UCLA: "The EEG can appear flat even in the presence of high activity, when that activity is not synchronous. For example, the EEG flattens in regions involved in direct task processing. This phenomenon is known as event-related desynchronization." Third, the experiences reported by NDE subjects have also been reported by other patients whose experiences had known triggers (mostly chemicals of a psychedelic nature.) The chemical processes that happen in a brain under oxygen deprivation are known to share some characteristics with the effects of psychoactive substances.
The NDE is often cited as evidence for the existence of the human soul and afterlife. However, the imagery in the experiences varies within cultures. Some view NDEs as a proof for heaven and hell, which appear in Christian and Islamic religious traditions, but those concepts do not apply to all religions. For example, Placide Tempels (a Belgian missionary) states that "most African peoples believe that rewards and punishments come to people in this life and not in the hereafter. In the land of the departed, what happens there happens automatically, irrespective of a person's earthly behavior".

William Shatner

William Shatner (born March 22, 1931) is a Canadian actor, musician, singer, author, film director, spokesman and comedian. He gained worldwide fame and became a cultural icon for his portrayal of Captain James Tiberius Kirk, commander of the Federation starship USS "Enterprise", in the science fiction television series ', from 1966 to 1969; ' from 1973 to 1974, and in seven of the subsequent "Star Trek" feature films from 1979 to 1994. He has written a series of books chronicling his experiences playing Captain Kirk and being a part of "Star Trek", and has co-written several novels set in the "Star Trek" universe. He has also authored a series of science fiction novels called "TekWar" that were adapted for television.
Shatner also played the eponymous veteran police sergeant in "T. J. Hooker" from 1982 to 1986. Afterwards, he hosted the reality-based television series "Rescue 911" from 1989 to 1996, which won a People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Dramatic Series. He has since worked as a musician, author, director and celebrity pitchman. From 2004 to 2008, he starred as attorney Denny Crane in the television dramas "The Practice" and its spin-off "Boston Legal", for which he won two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award.
Early life.
Shatner was born on March 22, 1931, in the Côte Saint-Luc neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the son of Joseph Shatner, a clothing manufacturer, and Anne (née Garmaise). He has two sisters, Joy and Farla. His paternal grandfather, Wolf Schattner, anglicized the family name to "Shatner." All of Shatner's grandparents were Jewish immigrants (from Austria, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine), and Shatner was raised in Conservative Judaism. He attended three schools in Montreal: Willingdon Elementary School in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG), Baron Byng High School, and West Hill High School in NDG, and is an alumnus of the Montreal Children's Theatre. Shatner also studied economics at McGill University in Montreal, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. In June 2011, McGill awarded him an honorary doctorate of Letters. The Students' Society of McGill University building on McTavish Street is popularly (though not officially) named "Shatner."
Acting career.
Early stage, film, and television work.
After graduating from McGill University in 1952, Shatner became the business manager for the Mountain Playhouse in Montreal before joining the Canadian National Repertory Theatre in Ottawa. Trained as a classical Shakespearean actor, Shatner began performing at the Shakespearean Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, beginning in 1954. He played a range of roles at the Stratford Festival in productions that included a minor role in the opening scene of a renowned and nationally televised production of Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex" directed by Tyrone Guthrie, Shakespeare's "Henry V", and Marlowe's "Tamburlaine the Great", in which Shatner made his Broadway debut in 1956. In 1954, he was cast as Ranger Bob on "The Canadian Howdy Doody Show". Shatner was understudy to Christopher Plummer; the two would later star as adversaries in "".
Though his official movie debut was in the 1951 Canadian film, "The Butler's Night Off", Shatner's first feature role came in the 1958 MGM film "The Brothers Karamazov" with Yul Brynner, in which he starred as the youngest of the Karamazov brothers, Alexei. In December of the same year, he appeared opposite Ralph Bellamy playing Roman tax collectors in Bethlehem on the day of Jesus' birth in a vignette of a "Hallmark Hall of Fame" live television production entitled "The Christmas Tree" directed by Kirk Browning, which featured in other vignettes such stars as Jessica Tandy, Margaret Hamilton, Bernadette Peters, Richard Thomas, Cyril Ritchard and Carol Channing. Shatner had a leading role in an "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" third-season (1957–1958) episode titled "The Glass Eye," one of his first appearances on American television.
In 1959, he received decent reviews when he took on the role of Lomax in the Broadway production of "The World of Suzie Wong". In March 1959 while performing on stage in "Suzie Wong", Shatner was also playing detective Archie Goodwin in what would have been television's first "Nero Wolfe" series had it not been aborted by CBS after shooting a pilot and a few episodes. In 1960, he appeared twice as Wayne Gorham in NBC's "Outlaws" Western series with Barton MacLane, and then in another "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" fifth-season episode titled "Mother, may I go out to swim?" In 1961, he starred in the Broadway play "A Shot in the Dark" with Julie Harris and directed by Harold Clurman. Walter Matthau (who won a Tony Award for his performance) and Gene Saks were also featured in this play. Shatner also starred in two episodes of the NBC television series "Thriller", "The Grim Reaper" and "The Hungry Glass." In 1961, he also starred in the film "The Explosive Generation".
Guthrie had called the young Shatner the Stratford Festival's most promising actor, and he was seen as a peer to contemporaries like Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Shatner was not as successful as the others, however, and during the 1960s he "became a working actor who showed up on time, knew his lines, worked cheap and always answered his phone." His motto was "Work equals work," but Shatner's willingness to take any role, no matter how "forgettable," likely hurt his career. In 1962, he starred in Roger Corman's movie "The Intruder". He also appeared in the Stanley Kramer film "Judgment at Nuremberg" and two episodes, "Nick of Time" and "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet," of the science fiction anthology series "The Twilight Zone". In the 1963–1964 season, he appeared in episodes of two ABC series, "Channing" and "The Outer Limits" ("Cold Hands, Warm Heart"). In 1963, he starred in the "Family Theater" production called "The Soldier" and received credits in other programs of "The Psalms" series. That same year, he guest starred in "Route 66", in the episode, "Build Your Houses with Their Backs to the Sea." In 1964, he guest starred in the episode "He Stuck in His Thumb" of the CBS drama "The Reporter". Also in 1964, he co-starred with Laurence Harvey, Claire Bloom, Paul Newman and Edward G. Robinson in the western film "The Outrage".
In 1965, Shatner guest-starred as Major Curt Brown in second season episode 9, "I Am the Enemy" of "12 O'Clock High". He guest-starred in "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." in an episode that also featured Leonard Nimoy, with whom Shatner would soon be paired in "Star Trek". He also starred in the critically acclaimed drama "For the People" in 1965, as an assistant district attorney, costarring with Jessica Walter. The program lasted for only thirteen episodes. Shatner starred in the 1966 gothic horror film "Incubus", the second feature-length movie ever made with all dialogue spoken in Esperanto. He also starred in an episode of "Gunsmoke" in 1966 as the character Fred Bateman. He appeared as attorney-turned-counterfeiter Brett Skyler in a 1966 episode of "The Big Valley", "Time To Kill." In 1967, he starred in the little known film "White Comanche" starring as two characters: Johnny Moon and his twin brother Notah.
"Star Trek".
Shatner was first cast as Captain James T. Kirk for the second pilot of "Star Trek", titled "Where No Man Has Gone Before" (although in one scene where the Gary Lockwood character Gary Mitchell is "contemplating the death of an old friend," the headstone he creates actually reads, "James R. Kirk"). He was then contracted to play Kirk for the "Star Trek" series and held the role from 1966 to 1969. During its original run on NBC, the series pulled in only modest ratings and was cancelled after three seasons. In 1973, he returned to the role of Captain Kirk, albeit only in voice, in the . In his role as Kirk, Shatner famously kissed actress Nichelle Nichols (Lt. Uhura) in the November 22, 1968, "Star Trek" episode, "Plato's Stepchildren." The episode is popularly cited as the first example of an interracial kiss between a white man and a black woman on scripted television in the United States.
1970s.
Shatner's wife Gloria Rand divorced him in March 1969. After "Star Trek" was cancelled that year, Shatner experienced difficulty in finding work in the early 1970s having been somewhat typecast from his role as Kirk. With very little money and few acting prospects, Shatner lost his home and lived in a truck bed camper in the San Fernando Valley until small roles turned into higher-paying jobs. Shatner refers to this part of his life as "that period," a humbling time during which he would take any odd job, including small party appearances, to support his family.
Shatner again appeared in "schlock" films, such as Corman's "Big Bad Mama" (1974) and the horror film "The Devil's Rain" (1975), and the TV movie "The Horror at 37,000 Feet", which many fans believe is his worst work. Shatner received good reviews as the lead prosecutor in a 1971 PBS adaptation of Saul Levitt's play "The Andersonville Trial". Other television appearances included a starring role in the western-themed secret agent series "Barbary Coast" during 1975 and 1976, and guest roles on many 1970s series such as "The Six Million Dollar Man", "Columbo", "The Rookies", "Kung Fu", "Ironside" and "". A martial arts enthusiast, Shatner studied American Kenpo karate under black belt Tom Bleecker (who trained under the founder of American Kenpo Ed Parker). His fellow students included Steve McQueen and Elvis Presley. Shatner was an occasional celebrity guest on "The $10,000 Pyramid" and "The $20,000 Pyramid" in the 1970s, once appearing opposite Nimoy in a week-long match-up billed as "Kirk vs. Spock." In an notable 1977 appearance he gave an illegal clue ("you're "blessed"" for "Things That Are Blessed") at the top of the pyramid ($200) which deprived the contestant of a big money win, and reacted strongly, throwing his chair out of the Winner's Circle. Other shows included "The Hollywood Squares", "Celebrity Bowling", "Beat the Clock", "Tattletales", Mike Stokey's "Stump the Stars" and "Match Game". He did a number of television commercials for Ontario-based Loblaws and British Columbia-based SuperValu supermarket chains in the 1970s, and finished the Loblaws ad spots by saying, "At Loblaws, more than the price is right. But, by Gosh, the price is right." He also did a number of television commercials for General Motors, endorsing the Oldsmobile brand, and Promise margarine.
A return to Kirk and to work.
After its cancellation, "Star Trek" unexpectedly engendered a cult following during the 1970s from syndicated reruns, and Captain Kirk became a cultural icon. Shatner began appearing at "Star Trek" conventions organized by Trekkies. In the mid-1970s, Paramount began pre-production for a revised "Star Trek" television series, tentatively titled '. However, the phenomenal success of "Star Wars" led the studio to instead consider developing a "Star Trek" motion picture. Shatner and the other original "Star Trek" cast members returned to their roles when Paramount produced ', released in 1979. It re-established Shatner as a major film studio actor, and he played Kirk in the next six "Star Trek" films, ending with the character's death in 1994's "Star Trek Generations". Some later appearances in the role are in the movie sequences of the video game "" (1997), briefly for a DirecTV advertisement using footage from "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" running from late summer 2006, and the 2013 Academy Awards, in which he reprised the role for a comedic interlude with host Seth MacFarlane.
Although Trekkies had resurrected "Star Trek" after cancellation, in a 1986 "Saturday Night Live" sketch about a "Star Trek" convention, Shatner advised a room full of fans to "get a life." The much-discussed sketch accurately portrayed his feelings about Trekkies, which the actor had previously discussed in interviews. Shatner had been their unwilling subject of adoration for decades; as early as April 1968, a group attempted to rip his clothes off as the actor left 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and he stopped attending conventions for more than a decade during the 1970s and 1980s. Shatner also appeared in the film "Free Enterprise" in 1998, in which he played himself and tried to dispel the Kirk image of himself from the view of the film's two lead characters. He also has found an outlet in spoofing the cavalier, almost superhuman, persona of Captain Kirk in films such as "" (1982) and "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1" (1993). In 1994, he starred as the murderer in the Columbo episode "Butterfly in Shades of Grey."
Besides the "Star Trek" films, Shatner landed a starring role on television as a police officer in "T. J. Hooker", which ran from 1982 to 1986. He then hosted the popular dramatic re-enactment series "Rescue 911" from 1989 to 1996. During the 1980s Shatner also began directing film and television, directing numerous episodes of "T. J. Hooker" and the feature film "".
Subsequent acting and media career.
Shatner has enjoyed success with a series of science fiction novels published under his name, though most are widely believed to have been written by uncredited co-writers such as William T. Quick and Ron Goulart. The first, published in 1989, was "TekWar", which Shatner claims he developed initially as a screenplay during a Writers Guild strike that delayed production of "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier". This popular series of books led to four "TekWar" television movies, in which Shatner played the role of Walter Bascom, the lead character's boss. A short-lived television series followed, airing on USA Network and Sci-Fi Channel in the United States and CTV in Canada, in which Shatner made several appearances in the Bascom role and directed some of the episodes.
In 1995, a first-person shooter game named "William Shatner's TekWar" was released, and was the first game to use the Build engine. He also played as a narrator in the 1995 American documentary film "Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie" directed by Peter Kuran. In the television series "3rd Rock from the Sun", Shatner appeared in several 1999–2000 episodes as the "Big Giant Head," a high-ranking officer from the same alien planet as the Solomon family who becomes a womanizing party-animal on Earth. The role earned Shatner an Emmy Award nomination.
Shatner has appeared in advertisements for many companies and products. Since the late 1990s he has done a series of commercials for the travel web site Priceline, in which Shatner plays a pompous, fictionalized version of himself. Although he received stock options for the commercials, Shatner insists that reports that they are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars are exaggerated. Shatner was also the CEO of the Toronto, Ontario-based C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures, a special effects studio that operated from 1994 to 2010.
In May 1999, Simon & Schuster published Shatner's book, "Get a Life!", which details his experiences with "Star Trek" fandom, anecdotes from "Trek" conventions, and his interviews with dedicated fans, in particular those who found deeper meaning in the franchise.
In 2000, Shatner co-starred in the movie "Miss Congeniality" as Stan Fields, playing the role of co-host of the Miss United States Pageant alongside future "Boston Legal" co-star Candice Bergen. He reprised the role in the 2004 sequel ', in which Stan Fields was kidnapped in Las Vegas along with the winner of the pageant of the previous year. In the 2001 live-action/animated film "Osmosis Jones", he voiced Mayor Phlegmming, the self-centered head of the "City of Frank," a community comprising all the cells and microorganisms of a man's body who is constantly preoccupied with his reelection and his own convenience, even to the detriment of his "city" and constituents. In 2003, Shatner appeared in Brad Paisley's "Celebrity" and "Online" music videos along with Little Jimmy Dickens, Jason Alexander, and Trista Rehn. Shatner also had a supporting role in the 2004 comedy ', which starred Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. "" producer Manny Coto stated in "Star Trek Communicator" October 2004 issue that he was preparing a three-episode story arc for Shatner. Shortly thereafter, "Enterprise" was cancelled.
After David E. Kelley saw Shatner's commercials, he joined the final season of the legal drama "The Practice". His Emmy-award winning role, the eccentric but highly capable attorney Denny Crane, was essentially "William Shatner the man . . . playing William Shatner the character playing the character Denny Crane, who was playing the character William Shatner." Shatner took the Crane role to "Boston Legal", and won a Golden Globe, an Emmy in 2005, and was nominated again in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 for his work. With the 2005 Emmy win, Shatner became one of the few actors (along with co-star James Spader as Alan Shore) to win an Emmy Award while playing the same character in two different series. Even rarer, Shatner and Spader each won a second consecutive Emmy while playing the same character in two different series. Shatner remained with the series until its end in 2008.
Shatner made several guest appearances on "The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien", including cameos reciting Sarah Palin's resignation speech, Twitter posts, and . He has also recited Twitter posts by Levi Johnston, father of Palin's grandson. He also appears in the opening graphics of the occasional feature "In the Year 3000," with his disembodied head floating through space, announcing, "And so we take a cosmic ride into that new millennium; that far off reality that is the year 3000," followed by the tag line, "It's the future, man." He also played the voice of Ozzie the opossum in DreamWorks' 2006 feature "Over the Hedge".
In January 2007, Shatner launched a series of daily vlogs on his life called ShatnerVision on the LiveVideo.com website. In 2008, he launched his video blogs on YouTube in a project renamed "The Shatner Project." Shatner also starred as the voice of Don Salmonella Gavone on the 2009 YouTube animated series "The Gavones".
Shatner was not "offered or suggested" a role in the 2009 film "Star Trek". Director J. J. Abrams said in July 2007 that the production was "desperately trying to figure out a way to put him in" but that to "shove him in . . . would be a disaster," an opinion echoed by Shatner in several interviews. At a convention held in 2010, Shatner commented on the film by saying "I've seen that wonderful film." Shatner had invented his own idea about the beginning of "Star Trek" with his 2007 novel, "Star Trek: Academy — Collision Course." His autobiography "Up Till Now: The Autobiography" was released in 2008. He was assisted in writing it by David Fisher. Shatner has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (for television work) at 6901 Hollywood Boulevard. He also has a star on the Canada's Walk of Fame. Shatner was the first Canadian actor to star in three successful television series on three different major networks (NBC, CBS, and ABC). He also starred in the CBS sitcom "$#*! My Dad Says", which is based on the Twitter feed Shit My Dad Says created by Justin Halpern. The series premiered in late 2010 and was canceled May 2011. Shatner is also the host of the interview show "Shatner's Raw Nerve" on The Biography Channel, and the Discovery Channel television series "Weird or What?" Also in 2011, Shatner appeared in the episode of "Psych" titled, "In For a Penny" on the USA Network as the estranged father of Junior Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson). He has signed on to continue the role into the 2012 season.
In 2011, Shatner starred in "The Captains", a feature length documentary which he also wrote and directed. The film follows Shatner as he interviews the other actors who have portrayed starship captains within the Star Trek franchise. Shatner's interviewees included Patrick Stewart, Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Scott Bakula, and Chris Pine. In the film, Shatner also interviews Christopher Plummer, who is an old friend and colleague from Shatner's days with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival.
In February 2012, Shatner performed in a new one-man show on Broadway, called "Shatner's World: We Just Live in It". After a 3-week run at the Music Box Theatre, the show is currently touring throughout the United States.
In May 2012, Shatner was the guest presenter on the British satirical television quiz show "Have I Got News for You", during which he coined the portmanteau "pensioneer," combining the words "pensioner" and "pioneer."
On July 28, 2012, the premium cable TV channel Epix premiered "Get a Life!", a documentary on "Star Trek" fandom starring Shatner that takes its title from his infamous "Saturday Night Live" line and his 1999 book on the topic.
On September 25, 2012, Shatner portrayed the home plate umpire in the music video "At Fenway," which was written and recorded by crooner Brian Evans. Evans' work is the first song to be written about Fenway Park to be licensed by Major League Baseball.
Music and spoken-word work.
Shatner began his musical career with the spoken-word 1968 album "The Transformed Man", delivering exaggerated, interpretive recitations of "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds." He performed a reading of the Elton John song "Rocket Man" during the 1978 Science Fiction Film Awards that has been widely parodied. Ben Folds, who has worked with him several times, produced and co-wrote Shatner's well-received second studio album, "Has Been", in 2004. His third studio album, "Seeking Major Tom", was released on October 11, 2011. The fourth, "Ponder The Mystery", was released in October 2013, produced and composed by musician Billy Sherwood (ex member of YES). William Shatner has done a concert tour with some ex member of YES as Tony Kaye and Billy Sherwood with the group of Circa.
Space Shuttle "Discovery".
Shatner recorded a wake-up call that was played for the crew of STS-133 in the Space Shuttle "Discovery" on March 7, 2011, its final day docked to the International Space Station. Backed by the musical theme from "Star Trek", it featured a voice-over based on his spoken introduction from the series' opening credits: "Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before."
Personal life.
Shatner dislikes watching himself perform, and claims that he has never watched any "Star Trek" or "Boston Legal" television episodes nor any of the "Star Trek" movies except the unedited footage from "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" which he directed, although he makes reference to having re-watched episodes of "Star Trek" in his book "Star Trek Memories".
Family.
Shatner has been married four times. His first marriage was to Gloria Rand, from 1956 to 1969. His second marriage to Marcy Lafferty (daughter of producer Perry Lafferty) lasted from 1973 to 1996.
His third marriage was to Nerine Kidd-Shatner, from 1997 until her death in 1999. On August 9, 1999, Shatner returned home around 10 pm to discover Nerine's body at the bottom of their backyard swimming pool. She was 40 years old. An autopsy detected alcohol and Valium in her blood, but the coroner ruled the cause of death as an accidental drowning. The LAPD ruled out foul play, and the case was closed. Speaking to the press shortly after his wife's death, a clearly shaken and emotional Shatner said that she "meant everything" to him, and called her his "beautiful soulmate." Shatner urged the public to support Friendly House, a non-profit organization that helps women re-establish themselves in the community after suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction. He later told Larry King in an interview that "... my wife, whom I loved dearly, and who loved me, was suffering with a disease that we don't like to talk about; alcoholism. And she met a tragic ending because of it." In his 2008 book "Up Till Now: The Autobiography", Shatner discusses how Leonard Nimoy helped take Nerine to treatment for her alcoholism. Shatner writes in an excerpt from his book:
In 2000, a Reuters story reported that Shatner was planning to write and direct "The Shiva Club", a dark comedy about the grieving process inspired by his wife's death. Shatner's 2004 album "Has Been" included a spoken word piece titled "What Have You Done" that describes his anguish upon discovering his wife's body in the pool. "What Have You Done" was also sampled in the Concord Dawn and Chris Su drum and bass track entitled "Scream To The Stars."
Since 2001, Shatner has been married to Elizabeth Anderson Martin. In 2004, she co-wrote the song "Together" on Shatner's album "Has Been".
Relationships with other actors.
Shatner first appeared on screen with Leonard Nimoy in 1964, when both actors guest-starred in an episode of "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." entitled "The Project Strigas Affair." However, Shatner states in his autobiography that he does not recall meeting Nimoy at that time. As co-stars on "Star Trek", they interacted socially both on and off the set. After "Star Trek" cancellation in 1969, Shatner and Nimoy reunited in the production of "", as well as "The $20,000 Pyramid", where "Kirk vs. Spock" appeared on two different tables. Nimoy also guest-starred on "T. J. Hooker" for a few episodes. Shatner starred in the title role of the show.
The 1999 death of Shatner's third wife, Nerine, served to strengthen the friendship of Shatner and Nimoy, as Nimoy had mourned over the loss. Nimoy also appeared alongside Shatner at the TV Land Awards (hosted by John Ritter) and was one of the many people to serve as a celebrity "roaster" of Shatner. Nimoy summarized his four decade friendship with Shatner by remarking, "Bill's energy was good for my performance, 'cause Spock could be the cool individual, our chemistry was successful, right from the start." Nimoy has spoken about their mutual rivalry during the "Star Trek" years: "Very competitive, sibling rivalry up to here. After the show had been on the air a few weeks and they started getting so much mail for Spock, then the dictum came down from NBC: 'Give us more of that guy, they love that guy, you know?' Well, that can be . . . that can be a problem for the leading man who was hired as the star of the show; and suddenly, here's this guy with ears – 'What's this, you know?'" said Nimoy. Shatner has similarly described their "Star Trek" relationship, stating that they only became close friends while attending fan conventions together. On an episode of the A&E series "Biography", Nimoy remarked, "Bill Shatner hogging the stage? No. Not the Bill Shatner I know."
Shatner has been a friend of actress Heather Locklear since 1982, when Locklear began co-starring with him on "T. J. Hooker" as Officer Stacy Sheridan. As she was also appearing in a semi-regular role in another Aaron Spelling production, "Dynasty", at the same time, Locklear was asked by "Entertainment Tonight" whether this schedule was difficult. She replied ". . . I'd get really nervous and want to be prepared . . ." for Shatner and for the experienced cast of "Dynasty". After "Hooker" ended Shatner helped Locklear get other roles. Locklear supported a grieving Shatner in 1999 when he was mourning the death of his wife, Nerine. In 2005, Locklear appeared in two episodes of Shatner's "Boston Legal" as Kelly Nolan, an attractive, youthful woman being tried for killing her much older, wealthy husband. Shatner plays Denny Crane, a founding partner of a large law firm, and a legendary litigator. Crane is attracted to Nolan and tries to insert himself into her defense. He is about the same age as Nolan's deceased husband, so Crane courts death by pursuing her. Locklear was asked how she came to appear on "Boston Legal". She explained "I love the show, it's my favorite show; and I sorta kind of said, 'Shouldn't I be William Shatner's illegitimate daughter, or his love interest?'"
For years, Shatner was accused of being difficult to work with by some of his "Star Trek" co-stars, most notably James Doohan and George Takei. In the 2004 "Star Trek" DVD sets, Shatner seemed to have made up with Takei, but their differences continue to resurface. In the 1990s, Shatner made numerous attempts to reconcile with Doohan, but was unsuccessful for some time; however, an Associated Press article published at the time of Doohan's final convention appearance in late August 2004 stated that Doohan had forgiven Shatner and they had mended their relationship.
Health problems.
Shatner suffers from tinnitus as a result of an accident on the set while shooting the "Star Trek" episode "Arena," and is involved in the American Tinnitus Association. His treatment for this condition involved wearing a small electronic device that generated a low-level, broadband sound (white noise) that "helped his brain put the tinnitus in the background."
Hobbies and charity work.
In 2006, Shatner sold his kidney stone for US$25,000 to GoldenPalace.com. In an appearance on "The View" on May 16, 2006, Shatner said the $25,000 and an additional $20,000 raised from the cast and crew of "Boston Legal" paid for the building of a house by Habitat for Humanity.
In his spare time, Shatner enjoys breeding and showing American Saddlebreds and Quarter Horses. Shatner rode one of his own horses, a mare named Great Belles of Fire, in his role as James T. Kirk in "Star Trek Generations". Shatner has a 150 hectare (360 acre) farm near Versailles, Kentucky, named Belle Reve (from the French "beau rève", "Beautiful Dream"—Belle Reve was the name of Blanche Dubois and her sister Stella's family home in "A Streetcar Named Desire"), where he raises American Saddlebreds including three named Call Me Ringo, Revival, and Sultan's Great Day. The farm's activities help benefit the Central Kentucky Riding for Hope "Horses For Heroes" program. Shatner also plays on the World Poker Tour in the Hollywood Home Games, where celebrities play for their favorite charities. Since 1990, he has been a leading force behind the Hollywood Charity Horse Show, which raises money for children's charities.
Nominations and awards.
Shatner earned Saturn Award nominations for his performances in the "Star Trek" films (as the awards did not reward television series at the time). He earned five Best Actor nominations: the first for "Kingdom of the Spiders", the four other for the first four "Star Trek" films. He won the award for "", and also earned The Life Career Award in 1980. On the negative side, Shatner was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards in "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier", including Worst Screenplay and won two for Worst Actor & Worst Director.
In 2004, Shatner won his first Emmy Award for his role as Denny Crane on "The Practice". In 2005, he won his first Golden Globe award and a second Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his work on "Boston Legal". In 2009, Shatner won a Streamy Award in the category of Best Reality Web Series.
In 2006, Shatner was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.
In May 2011, he was honoured with the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for lifetime achievement, recording a humorous short film "William Shatner Sings O Canada" for the occasion. On June 2, 2011, Shatner received an honorary doctorate of Letters from McGill University, his "alma mater".

Djurgården

Djurgården () or, more officially, Kungliga Djurgården (Swedish: "The (Royal) Game Park") is an island in central Stockholm. Djurgården is home to historical buildings and monuments, museums, galleries, the amusement park Gröna Lund, the open air museum Skansen, the small residential area "Djurgårdsstaden", yacht harbours, and extensive stretches of forest and meadows. It is one of the Stockholmers' favorite recreation areas and tourist destination alike, attracting over 10 million visitors per year, of which some 5 million come to visit the museums and amusement park. The island belongs to the National City park founded in 1995. Since the 15th century the Swedish monarch has owned or held the right of disposition of Royal Djurgården. Today, this right is exercised by the Royal Djurgården Administration which is a part of the Royal Court of Sweden.
A larger area of the city, separated from Djurgården proper by Djurgårdsbrunnsviken is Norra Djurgården ("Northern Djurgården"), including Gärdet.
History.
Djurgården was until the 16th century known as "Valmundsö" (spelled 
"Walmunzø" (1286), "Walmundzø" (1288), "Walmanzö" (1349), "Wadhmundzøø" (1432), "Wadhmalsø" (1437), "Wadmalsö" (1444), "Walmundzön" (1452), "Walmasöön" (1511), "Walmarsöö" (1516), "Wallmarsön", "Waldemarksön" (17th century)) and this name is still preserved in locations such as Waldemarsudde. Though several proposals to explain this name have been put forward, no authoritative explanation is generally accepted. While the name of King Valdemar (1239–1302) was probably associated with the old name during the 17th century, the separate elements of the original variations of the name might be interpreted as etymologically related to either "Walm-und-ö" - if "walm" is linked to the Anglo-Saxon words "wielm", "wylm", this would mean the original name should be interpreted as "The island outside of which the waves grow large" (an interpretation with no equivalents in other Nordic geographic names) - or "Wal-mund-ö" - which could possibly be interpreted as "walder" ("embankment", "grounds") and "mun" ("mouth"), i.e. "the grounds next to the mouth of Lake Mälaren".
The present name, "Djurgården", stems from the game park of King John III, which he declared the intention to realize in February 1579 to keep deer, reindeer, and elk. In the 17th century a baiting arena was built at the location.
In 1667, a few cottages intended for "paralysed and crippled seafarers" were built forming what was to become Djurgårdsstaden. The Swedish Navy moved to Karlskrona during the 1680s however, and the neighbourhood was instead populated by a diverse crowd. Plans to demolish the "insignificant shacks" in front of the World Fair in 1897, and for a planned expansion of the naval shipyard in 1918, never were accomplished and the area is today protected as a historical monument.
During the late 18th century, Djurgården transformed into more of a popular recreational area than a Royal game park; in 1801, the theatre Djurgårdsteatern was opened, which was to be one of the most popular establishments there during the 19th century. King Charles XIV John's creation of the Rosendal Palace in the 1820s marked the beginning of Djurgården's development into as a stately residential area, paired with the creation of several entertainment establishment in the late 19th century, including Gröna Lund 1883, and Skansen 1891.
The western water front of the island was a small scale shipyard during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, after which the Navy erected some 30 sheds for the winter quarters of galleys in the area. The operations expanded during the 1870s when a dry dock was constructed. Plans to relocate the shipyard in the beginning of the 20th century were interrupted by WWII, which meant the activities grew considerably instead, culminating in 1945 when 1,280 people were employed. In 1969, the Navy moved to Muskö, and in the early 1970s the area was transformed into the recreation area it is today.
Many structures on the western part of Djurgården date back to the Stockholm World's Fair of 1897, including Djurgårdsbron, the main bridge to the island. One of the most prominent buildings of the exposition, a 16,820 m² exposition hall in wood, design by the architect Ferdinand Boberg and featuring a 100 metres tall cupola and 4 minarets, was demolished after the exposition however, together with many other pavilions built in non-permanent materials.
In what is today the southern part of the amusement park Gröna Lund and east of it, a private shipyard was developed from 1735 by the merchant Efraim Lothsack, who also had several new residential buildings built. The activities grew during the 19th century under the managership of John Burgman and Adolf Fredholm, of which the former had the church, Djurgårdskyrkan, and the school, Djurgårdsskolan, built. The shipyard was sold to the city in 1863 and moved to Södra Hammarbyhamnen in 1979. Another shipyard for pinnaces, built in the strait between Djurgården and Beckholmen in 1868, is still in operation.
The southern portion of the area hosted the Stockholm International Exhibition (1930).
Sights and monuments.
Besides the list below, a big portion of Djurgården consists of green areas offering footpaths and water front promenades among present or historical upper class residences and old institutional buildings, many of which are regarded as historical monuments of national interest.
Transport.
Ways to get there include by foot, by tram from Sergels Torg or by boat from Nybroplan, Skeppsholmen or Slussen.

Djurgårdsteatern

Djurgårsdteatern (Swedish for "Djurgården Theatre"), was an historical Swedish theatre, active at Djurgården in Stockholm between 1801 and 1929 (from 1863 in a new building).
It was the only theatre in Stockholm outside the royal theatres during the monopol of the royal theatres between 1799 and 1842, and it also played an important part in abolishing this royal monopol. Until 1842, it was a "summer theatre", but later, it became an all-year theatre and an important one, called the "theatre of the people". It was described as a wood building with the same exterior of a barn, and was painted yellow.
History.
In 1795, Abraham de Broen (1759–1804), actor at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, asked for the permission to build and run a theatre, and a theatre-privilege were given to himself, his wife and their children for as long as they wished to use it. In 1798, a new theatre monopoly was stated, which banned all theatres except the royal ones inside the city border of Stockholm.
When the Djurgårdsteatern was opened in 1801, however, it was located on Djurgården, at the time an island outside the city itself, and furthermore, it was not what was counted as a "real theatre"; it was what was called a "summer theatre", active only in summers, and often called "The Summer stage". Thereby, it did not threaten the royal monopoly.
The staff at the theatre was described as "former footmen and maids", and it was often used as a stage for travelling theatre troupes passing through Stockholm, but many of the actors from the Royal Dramatic theatre and the Royal Swedish Opera made guest performances, making their débuts and started their careers here. The actors at Djurgårsteatern also toured on the country side. It was described as a smaller, more informal and less high pitched theatre. After the death of Abraham de Broen, it was managed by his widow Maria Elisabeth Grundt and his son, actor Isaac de Broen.
In the 1830s, Djurgårdsteatern entered a new age when it was the place of the abolishment of the royal theatre privilege in Stockholm. After the great theatre strike on the Royal Dramatic theatre by the actor couple Ulrik Torsslow and Sara Torsslow in 1834, the Torsslow couple left the royal theatre along with many other stars, who started to perform the Djurgårdsteatern in summer and in "Kirsteinska huset", a concert house, in winter. The director of the Djurgården theatre, Isaac de Broen's brother-in-law Karl Wildner, married to Debora Aurora de Broen, then transferred the old theatre privilege of the de Broen-family on Torsslow and Pierre Deland, who worked on abolishing the old theatre regulation. In the 1841-1842 season, Torsslow stated, that he would start to play on Djurgårsteatern in the winters as well, no matter if he was stopped or not, and as the government did not wish to stop him, the old regulation was formally abolished in 1842. This quickly led to the establishment of several new theatres, such as Mindre teatern (or Nya teatern) in 1842, Södra teatern (1852) and Ladugårdslandsteatern (1856).
In 1863, Djurgårdsteatern burnt down, and the de Broen's privilege was abolished, but it was rebuilt again in 1866-67 and continued with its activity until it burnt down again in 1929.

Conic section

[[File:Conic sections with plane.svg|right|300px|thumb|Types of conic sections:
1. Parabola
2. Circle and ellipse
3. Hyperbola]]
In mathematics, a conic section (or just conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of a cone (more precisely, a right circular conical surface) with a plane. In analytic geometry, a conic may be defined as a plane algebraic curve of degree 2. There are a number of other geometric definitions possible. One of the most useful, in that it involves only the plane, is that a conic consists of those points whose distances to some point, called a "focus", and some line, called a "directrix", are in a fixed ratio, called the "eccentricity".
Traditionally, the three types of conic section are the hyperbola, the parabola, and the ellipse. The circle is a special case of the ellipse, and is of sufficient interest in its own right that it is sometimes called the fourth type of conic section. The type of a conic corresponds to its eccentricity, those with eccentricity less than 1 being ellipses, those with eccentricity equal to 1 being parabolas, and those with eccentricity greater than 1 being hyperbolas. In the focus-directrix definition of a conic the circle is a limiting case with eccentricity 0. In modern geometry certain degenerate cases, such as the union of two lines, are included as conics as well.
The conic sections were named and studied at least since 200 BC, when Apollonius of Perga undertook a systematic study of their properties.
History.
Menaechmus and early works.
It is believed that the first definition of a conic section is due to Menaechmus (died 320 BC). His work did not survive and is only known through secondary accounts. The definition used at that time differs from the one commonly used today in that it requires the plane cutting the cone to be perpendicular to one of the lines, (a generatrix), that generates the cone as a surface of revolution. Thus the shape of the conic is determined by the angle formed at the vertex of the cone (between two opposite generatrices): If the angle is acute then the conic is an ellipse; if the angle is right then the conic is a parabola; and if the angle is obtuse then the conic is a hyperbola. Note that the circle cannot be defined this way and was not considered a conic at this time.
Euclid ( fl. 300 BC ) is said to have written four books on conics but these were lost as well. Archimedes (died c. 212 BC) is known to have studied conics, having determined the area bounded by a parabola and an ellipse. The only part of this work to survive is a book on the solids of revolution of conics.
Apollonius of Perga.
The greatest progress in the study of conics by the ancient Greeks is due to Apollonius of Perga (died c. 190 BC), whose eight-volume "Conic Sections" summarized the existing knowledge at the time and greatly extended it. Apollonius's major innovation was to characterize a conic using properties within the plane and intrinsic to the curve; this greatly simplified analysis. With this tool, it was now possible to show that any plane cutting the cone, regardless of its angle, will produce a conic according to the earlier definition, leading to the definition commonly used today.
Pappus of Alexandria (died c. 350 CE) is credited with discovering importance of the concept of a focus of a conic, and the discovery of the related concept of a directrix.
Al-Kuhi.
An instrument for drawing conic sections was first described in 1000 CE by the Islamic mathematician Al-Kuhi.
Omar Khayyám.
Apollonius's work was translated into Arabic (the technical language of the time) and much of his work only survives through the Arabic version. Persians found applications to the theory; the most notable of these was the Persian mathematician and poet Omar Khayyám who used conic sections to solve algebraic equations.
Europe.
Johannes Kepler extended the theory of conics through the "principle of continuity", a precursor to the concept of limits.
Girard Desargues and Blaise Pascal developed a theory of conics using an early form of projective geometry and this helped to provide impetus for the study of this new field. In particular, Pascal discovered a theorem known as the hexagrammum mysticum from which many other properties of conics can be deduced.
Meanwhile, René Descartes applied his newly discovered Analytic geometry to the study of conics. This had the effect of reducing the geometrical problems of conics to problems in algebra.
Features.
The three types of conics are the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola. The circle can be considered as a fourth type (as it was by Apollonius) or as a kind of ellipse. The circle and the ellipse arise when the intersection of cone and plane is a closed curve. The circle is obtained when the cutting plane is parallel to the plane of the generating circle of the cone – for a right cone as in the picture at the top of the page this means that the cutting plane is perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the cone. If the cutting plane is parallel to exactly one generating line of the cone, then the conic is unbounded and is called a parabola. In the remaining case, the figure is a hyperbola. In this case, the plane will intersect "both" halves ("nappes") of the cone, producing two separate unbounded curves.
Various parameters are associated with a conic section, as shown in the following table. (For the ellipse, the table gives the case of "a">"b", for which the major axis is horizontal; for the reverse case, interchange the symbols "a" and "b". For the hyperbola the east-west opening case is given. In all cases, "a" and "b" are positive.)
Conic sections are exactly those curves that, for a point "F", a line "L" not containing "F" and a non-negative number "e", are the locus of points whose distance to "F" equals "e" times their distance to "L". "F" is called the focus, "L" the directrix, and "e" the eccentricity.
The linear eccentricity ("c") is the distance between the center and the focus (or one of the two foci).
The latus rectum (2"ℓ") is the chord parallel to the directrix and passing through the focus (or one of the two foci).
The semi-latus rectum ("ℓ") is half the latus rectum.
The focal parameter ("p") is the distance from the focus (or one of the two foci) to the directrix.
The following relations hold:
Construction.
There are many methods to construct a conic. One of them, that is useful in engineering applications, being parallelogram method, where a conic is constructed point by point by means of connecting certain equally spaced points on horizontal line and vertical line.
Properties.
Just as two (distinct) points determine a line, five points determine a conic. Formally, given any five points in the plane in general linear position, meaning no three collinear, there is a unique conic passing through them, which will be non-degenerate; this is true over both the affine plane and projective plane. Indeed, given any five points there is a conic passing through them, but if three of the points are collinear the conic will be degenerate (reducible, because it contains a line), and may not be unique; see further discussion.
Irreducible conic sections are always "smooth". This is important for many applications, such as aerodynamics, where a smooth surface is required to ensure laminar flow and to prevent turbulence.
Intersection at infinity.
An algebro-geometrically intrinsic form of this classification is by the intersection of the conic with the line at infinity, which gives further insight into their geometry:
Degenerate cases.
There are five degenerate cases: three in which the plane passes through apex of the cone, and three that arise when the cone itself degenerates to a cylinder (a doubled line can occur in both cases).
When the plane passes through the apex, the resulting conic is always degenerate, and is either: a point (when the angle between the plane and the axis of the cone is larger than tangential); a straight line (when the plane is tangential to the surface of the cone); or a pair of intersecting lines (when the angle is smaller than the tangential). These correspond respectively to degeneration of an ellipse, parabola, and a hyperbola, which are characterized in the same way by angle. The straight line is more precisely a "double" line (a line with multiplicity 2) because the plane is tangent to the cone, and thus the intersection should be counted twice.
Where the cone is a cylinder, i.e. with the vertex at infinity, cylindric sections are obtained; this corresponds to the apex being at infinity. Cylindrical sections are ellipses (or circles), unless the plane is vertical (which corresponds to passing through the apex at infinity), in which case three degenerate cases occur: two parallel lines, known as a ribbon (corresponding to an ellipse with one axis infinite and the other axis real and non-zero, the distance between the lines), a double line (an ellipse with one infinite axis and one axis zero), and no intersection (an ellipse with one infinite axis and the other axis imaginary).
Eccentricity, focus and directrix.
The four defining conditions above can be combined into one condition that depends on a fixed point formula_3 (the focus), a line formula_4 (the directrix) not containing formula_3 and a nonnegative real number formula_6 (the "eccentricity"). The corresponding conic section consists of the locus of all points whose distance to formula_3 equals formula_6 times their distance to formula_4. For formula_10 we obtain an ellipse, for formula_11 a parabola, and for formula_12 a hyperbola.
For an ellipse and a hyperbola, two focus-directrix combinations can be taken, each giving the same full ellipse or hyperbola. The distance from the center to the directrix is formula_13, where formula_14 is the semi-major axis of the ellipse, or the distance from the center to the tops of the hyperbola. The distance from the center to a focus is formula_15.
In the case of a circle, the eccentricity formula_16, and one can imagine the directrix to be infinitely far removed from the center. However, the statement that the circle consists of all points whose distance to F is e times the distance to L is not useful, because we get zero times infinity.
The eccentricity of a conic section is thus a measure of how far it deviates from being circular.
For a given formula_17, the closer formula_6 is to 1, the smaller is the semi-minor axis.
Generalizations.
Conics may be defined over other fields, and may also be classified in the projective plane rather than in the affine plane.
Over the complex numbers ellipses and hyperbolas are not distinct, since there is no meaningful difference between 1 and −1; precisely, the ellipse formula_19 becomes a hyperbola under the substitution formula_20 geometrically a complex rotation, yielding formula_21 – a hyperbola is simply an ellipse with an imaginary axis length. Thus there is a 2-way classification: ellipse/hyperbola and parabola. Geometrically, this corresponds to intersecting the line at infinity in either 2 distinct points (corresponding to two asymptotes) or in 1 double point (corresponding to the axis of a parabola), and thus the real hyperbola is a more suggestive image for the complex ellipse/hyperbola, as it also has 2 (real) intersections with the line at infinity.
In projective space, over any division ring, but in particular over either the real or complex numbers, all non-degenerate conics are equivalent, and thus in projective geometry one simply speaks of "a conic" without specifying a type, as type is not meaningful. Geometrically, the line at infinity is no longer special (distinguished), so while some conics intersect the line at infinity differently, this can be changed by a projective transformation – pulling an ellipse out to infinity or pushing a parabola off infinity to an ellipse or a hyperbola.
A generalization of a non degenerate conic in a projective plane is an oval. An oval is a point set that has the following properties, which are held by conics: 1) any line intersects an oval in none, one or two points, 2) at any point of the oval there exists a unique tangent line.
In other areas of mathematics.
The classification into elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic is pervasive in mathematics, and often divides a field into sharply distinct subfields. The classification mostly arises due to the presence of a quadratic form (in two variables this corresponds to the associated discriminant), but can also correspond to eccentricity.
Quadratic form classifications:
Eccentricity classifications include:
Cartesian coordinates.
In the Cartesian coordinate system, the graph of a quadratic equation in two variables is always a conic section – though it may be degenerate, and all conic sections arise in this way. The equation will be of the form
As scaling all six constants yields the same locus of zeros, one can consider conics as points in the five-dimensional projective space formula_34
Discriminant classification.
The conic sections described by this equation can be classified with the discriminant
If the conic is non-degenerate, then:
To distinguish the degenerate cases from the non-degenerate cases, let "∆" be the determinant of the 3×3 matrix ["A", "B"/2, "D"/2 ; "B"/2, "C", "E"/2 ; "D"/2, "E"/2, "F" ]: that is, "∆" = ("AC" - "B"2/4)"F" + "BED"/4 - "CD"2/4 - "AE"2/4. Then the conic section is non-degenerate if and only if "∆" ≠ 0. If "∆"=0 we have a point ellipse, two parallel lines (possibly coinciding with each other) in the case of a parabola, or two intersecting lines in the case of a hyperbola.
Moreover, in the case of a non-degenerate ellipse (with formula_36 and "∆"≠0), we have a real ellipse if "C∆" < 0 but an imaginary ellipse if "C∆" > 0. An example is formula_43, which has no real-valued solutions.
Note that A and B are polynomial coefficients, not the lengths of semi-major/minor axis as defined in some sources.
Matrix notation.
The above equation can be written in matrix notation as
The type of conic section is solely determined by the determinant of middle matrix: if it is positive, zero, or negative then the conic is an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola respectively (see geometric meaning of a quadratic form). If both the eigenvalues of the middle matrix are non-zero (i.e. it is an ellipse or a hyperbola), we can do a transformation of variables to obtain
formula_45
where a,c, and G satisfy formula_46 and formula_47.
The quadratic can also be written as
If the determinant of this 3×3 matrix is non-zero, the conic section is not degenerate. If the determinant equals zero, the conic is a degenerate parabola (two parallel or coinciding lines), a degenerate ellipse (a point ellipse), or a degenerate hyperbola (two intersecting lines).
Note that in the centered equation with constant term "G", "G" equals minus one times the ratio of the 3×3 determinant to the 2×2 determinant.
As slice of quadratic form.
The equation
can be rearranged by taking the affine linear part to the other side, yielding
In this form, a conic section is realized exactly as the intersection of the graph of the quadratic form formula_51 and the plane formula_52 Parabolas and hyperbolas can be realized by a horizontal plane (formula_53), while ellipses require that the plane be slanted. Degenerate conics correspond to degenerate intersections, such as taking slices such as formula_54 of a positive-definite form.
Eccentricity in terms of parameters of the quadratic form.
When the conic section is written algebraically as
the eccentricity can be written as a function of the parameters of the quadratic equation. If 4"AC" = "B"2 the conic is a parabola and its eccentricity equals 1 (if it is non-degenerate). Otherwise, assuming the equation represents either a non-degenerate hyperbola or a non-degenerate, non-imaginary ellipse, the eccentricity is given by
where η = 1 if the determinant of the 3×3 matrix is negative and η = −1 if that determinant is positive.
Standard form.
Through change of coordinates (a rotation of axes and a translation) these equations can be put in standard forms:
Such forms will be symmetrical about both the -axis and -axis (for the circle, ellipse and hyperbola), or about either but not both (for the parabola). The rectangular hyperbola, however, is only symmetrical about the lines and . 
These standard forms can be written as parametric equations,
Invariants of conics.
The trace and determinant of formula_57 are both invariant with respect to both rotation of axes and translation of the plane (movement of the origin).
The constant term "F" is invariant under rotation only.
Modified form.
For some practical applications, it is important to re-arrange the standard form so that the focal-point can be placed at the origin. The mathematical formulation for a general conic section is then given in the polar form by
and in the Cartesian form by
From the above equation, the linear eccentricity ("c") is given by
formula_60.
From the general equations given above, different conic sections can be represented as shown below:
Homogeneous coordinates.
In homogeneous coordinates a conic section can be represented as:
Or in matrix notation
The matrix formula_67 is called "the matrix of the conic section".
formula_68 is called the determinant of the conic section. If Δ = 0 then the "conic section" is said to be "degenerate"; this means that the conic section is either a union of two straight lines, a repeated line, a point or the empty set.
For example, the conic section formula_69 reduces to the union of two lines:
Similarly, a conic section sometimes reduces to a (single) repeated line:
formula_72 is called the discriminant of the conic section. If δ = 0 then the "conic section" is a parabola, if δ < 0, it is an hyperbola and if δ > 0, it is an ellipse. A conic section is a circle if δ > 0 and A1 = A2 and B1 = 0, it is an rectangular hyperbola if δ < 0 and A1 = −A2. It can be proven that in the complex projective plane CP2 two conic sections have four points in common (if one accounts for multiplicity), so there are never more than 4 intersection points and there is always one "intersection point" (possibilities: four distinct intersection points, two singular intersection points and one double intersection points, two double intersection points, one singular intersection point and 1 with multiplicity 3, 1 intersection point with multiplicity 4). If there exists at least one intersection point with multiplicity > 1, then the two conic sections are said to be tangent. If there is only one intersection point, which has multiplicity 4, the two conic sections are said to be osculating.
Furthermore each straight line intersects each conic section twice. If the intersection point is double, the line is said to be tangent and it is called the tangent line.
Because every straight line intersects a conic section twice, each conic section has two points at infinity (the intersection points with the line at infinity). If these points are real, the conic section must be a hyperbola, if they are imaginary conjugated, the conic section must be an ellipse, if the conic section has one double point at infinity it is a parabola. If the points at infinity are (1,i,0) and (1,-i,0), the conic section is a circle (see circular points at infinity). If a conic section has one real and one imaginary point at infinity or it has two imaginary points that are not conjugated then it not a real conic section (its coefficients are complex).
Polar coordinates.
In polar coordinates, a conic section with one focus at the origin and, if any, the other on the "x"-axis, is given by the equation
where "e" is the eccentricity and "l" is the semi-latus rectum (see above).
As above, for "e" = 0, we have a circle, for 0 < "e" < 1 we obtain an ellipse, for "e" = 1 a parabola, and for "e" > 1 a hyperbola.
Pencil of conics.
A (non-degenerate) conic is completely determined by five points in general position (no three collinear) in a plane and the system of conics which pass through a fixed set of four points (again in a plane and no three collinear) is called a pencil of conics. The four common points are called the "base points" of the pencil. Through any point other than a base point, there passes a single conic of the pencil. This concept generalizes a pencil of circles.
In a projective plane defined over an algebraically closed field any two conics meet in four points (counted with multiplicity) and so, determine the pencil of conics based on these four points. Furthermore, the four base points determine three line pairs (degenerate conics through the base points, each line of the pair containing exactly two base points) and so each pencil of conics will contain at most three degenerate conics.
A pencil of conics can represented algebraically in the following way. Let "C"1 and "C"2 be two distinct conics in a projective plane defined over an algebraically closed field "K". For every pair λ, μ of elements of "K", not both zero, the expression:
represents a conic in the pencil determined by "C"1 and "C"2. This symbolic representation can be made concrete with a slight abuse of notation (using the same notation to denote the object as well as the equation defining the object.) Thinking of "C"1, say, as a ternary quadratic form, then "C"1 = 0 is the equation of the "conic "C"1". Another concrete realization would be obtained by thinking of "C"1 as the 3×3 symmetric matrix which represents it. If "C"1 and "C"2 have such concrete realizations then every member of the above pencil will as well. Since the setting uses homogeneous coordinates in a projective plane, two concrete representations (either equations or matrices) give the same conic if they differ by a non-zero multiplicative constant.
Intersecting two conics.
The solutions to a system of two second degree equations in two variables may be viewed as the coordinates of the points of intersection of two generic conic sections.
In particular two conics may possess none, two or four possibly coincident intersection points.
An efficient method of locating these solutions exploits the homogeneous matrix representation of conic sections, i.e. a 3x3 symmetric matrix which depends on six parameters.
The procedure to locate the intersection points follows these steps, where the conics are represented by matrices:
Applications.
Conic sections are important in astronomy: the orbits of two massive objects that interact according to Newton's law of universal gravitation are conic sections if their common center of mass is considered to be at rest. If they are bound together, they will both trace out ellipses; if they are moving apart, they will both follow parabolas or hyperbolas. See two-body problem.
In projective geometry, the conic sections in the projective plane are equivalent to each other up to projective transformations.
For specific applications of each type of conic section, see the articles circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola.
For certain fossils in paleontology, understanding conic sections can help understand the three-dimensional shape of certain organisms.

Toledano

Toledano (, ) is a family name derived from the city of Toledo, Spain. Bearers of the name can be found mainly in Spanish-speaking countries, the United States, France, Canada, Israel, and Australia. Among Ladino-speaking Sephardi Jews in their various diasporas, the Toledano surname is still prevalent, indicating an ancestry traced back to Toledo, Spain. It should also be noted that the Toledano name was also retained among non-Jews in various Spanish-speaking countries.
The Jewish Toledanos were expelled from Spain in 1492. After the expulsion from Spain the Toledanos went to Safed, Salonika, and Morocco. They arrived in Fez, Morocco during the 16th century from Salonika and from there went to Meknes and became leaders of the community from the 16th century until the present day.

He is the host of "The Mike Rosen Show" on talk radio station 850 KOA in Denver, Colorado, as well as a weekly opinion columnist for "The Denver Post" and previously a weekly opinion columnist for the "Rocky Mountain News". Rosen has described himself as an "advocate for generally right-center, mainstream conservative ideas."
"The Mike Rosen Show".
Mike Rosen is a self-described conservative political commentator and longtime host of "The Mike Rosen Show", a political talk radio show on 850 KOA, broadcasting out of Denver, Colorado, where he holds the weekday 1 p.m.-3 p.m. time slot. Rosen had previously occupied the 9 a.m.-12 p.m. time slot for over 25 years, but moved to afternoons (and lost one hour) starting on January 6, 2014. The change was made in order for KOA to air The Rush Limbaugh Show live from 10 a.m.-1 p.m. Prior to the time change, The Rush Limbaugh Show was recorded and aired from 12 p.m.-3 p.m.
Rosen has filled in for Rush Limbaugh on "The Rush Limbaugh Show" on February 24 and 25, 2005.
The Governor of Colorado and the Mayor of Denver come on as guests to "The Mike Rosen Show" on a monthly basis to discuss current issues and to answer listeners' questions. Other prominent guests to have come on "The Mike Rosen Show" include John McCain and Condoleezza Rice.
Mike Rosen has appeared on the "Talkers Magazine" "Heavy Hundred" list of the most important U.S. radio talk show hosts. In 2009 Rosen appeared as number 82 on the list and in 2010 as number 86.
Newspaper columns and other commentary.
Starting March 6, 2009, Rosen writes a weekly column for "The Denver Post". Prior to moving to The Denver Post, Rosen wrote a weekly column for the "Rocky Mountain News" until that newspaper's final issue in February 2009.
He is also contributing political commentary to other outlets, including RealClearPolitics.
Rosen wrote a May 31, 2012 column for "The Denver Post", under the headline "Mike Coffman was right about Obama in the first place," strongly agreeing with a speech given by Mike Coffman. In that speech, Coffman questioned the birth certificate of President Barack Obama and asserted that Obama was not loyal to the United States. Rosen dismissed Coffman's later apology as a "pragmatic" election-year maneuver.
Biography.
Rosen was born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 5, 1944. He grew up in New York and has lived in Colorado for more than 30 years. He earned an MBA degree from the University of Denver and has worked as a corporate finance executive at Samsonite and Beatrice Foods. A veteran of the U.S. Army, Rosen served as Special Assistant for Financial Management to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy at The Pentagon. He is divorced and has two grown children.
On February 2, 2009 it was reported that Rosen had lost a "seven-figure sum" of his retirement savings from investing with Agile Group, a Boulder, Colorado investment firm that Rosen had run ads for on the air, and that unknown to Rosen at the time was acting as a feeder fund for Bernard Madoff. Rosen devoted the first full hour of his February 3, 2009 radio show to this topic.

Keyhaven, Pennington, Oxey and Normandy Marshes

Keyhaven, Pennington, Oxey and Normandy Marshes, also known as the North Solent Marshes, are three areas of marshland in Hampshire, England. The village of Keyhaven lies to the west, the village of Pennington to the north, and the town of Lymington to the northeast. The marshes fall within the Hurst Castle And Lymington River Estuary Site of Special Scientific Interest. 
History.
The marshes were once used as salterns for the thriving salt industry. The salterns are first mentioned in 1132, and continued in use until 1865. They were replaced by oyster beds, but are now disused marshland with some enclosing banks. A circular mound 1.2 metres high and 12 metres across is all that remains of a mill, and there is another mound with an overgrown brick structure and rectangular pond of unknown date. Just north of the marshes, in Lower Pennington, are several 18th-century salt boiling houses.
Nature reserve.
The marshes are a site of special scientific interest and an area of outstanding natural beauty. They are part of the New Forest National Park, and in summer are grazed by cattle and ponies owned by New Forest commoners. Part of the marshes behind the sea wall are a National Nature Reserve managed by English Nature, and a local nature reserve managed by Hampshire County Council. Part of the intertidal mudland is also a nature reserve. The marshes and tidal muds offer a variety of wildlife habitats, which are important for gulls and terns in spring/summer and waders and wildfowl in autumn/winter. 
At Pennington Marshes, there are several lagoons, situated just inside the seawall - at the western end is Fishtail Lagoon, and the east of that Butts Lagoon.
A number of rare vagrant birds have occurred at the marshes including a Stilt Sandpiper in 2002, and a Lesser Sand Plover in 2003.

Murder of John Hurford

The murder of John Hurford occurred on 8 April 1855 in Western Australia. His murder led to the first execution of a woman in Western Australia for the crime of murder.
Hurford arrived in the colony of Western Australia in 1830. He was granted 400 hectares of land at Augusta and purchased a further 100 hectares at Wonnerup Inlet near Busselton. By the age of 65, he had amassed a fortune of £2,000. He married Bridget Larkin in 1851. She had been widowed when her husband had drowned in Bunbury. There were six children of this earlier marriage.
The relationship was not to be a happy one. Larkin was abusive towards her new husband. Hurford alleged to a friend that Larkin had knocked out some of his teeth during an argument. By February 1855 he had had enough and left the house. He stayed with his neighbour sharing a room with a workhand, George Jones. He stayed there for six weeks refusing to return to the matrimonial home. He purchased another house with the intention of moving there and living there without his wife.
Before moving to his new home, he was forced to return to his matrimonial home in late March 1855 because of the lack of space at his neighbours premises. Jones continued to share the room with Hurford. On 8 April 1855 Hurford was not well. He had a cold and felt sore and fatigued. His wife offered him some mulled wine which he accepted. His wife also sent word to Jones that Hurford wished to sleep on his own that night because of his illness. She sent her daughter away, too.
Later that night Hurford was found in bed with the sheet drawn up to his face, his eyes wide open and slightly protruding. Jones noticed a red mark on the left and right sides of Hurford's neck.
An inquest was held by the Coroner. The evidence of Dr Hannibal Bryan led to a finding of natural death by the coroner. Bryan gave evidence that Hurford had died of natural causes. 
Later that month, Enoch Dodd confessed the murder to his friend Philip Dixon. Dixon had earlier forged Hurford's will in favour of Larkin. Dodd said that he had killed Hurfield at the urging of Larkin. Larkin had plied Dodd with alcohol. When Dodd had baulked at performing the murder, Larkin had stood over Dodd and made sure that Dodd had completed the deed. Larkin made noise in the kitchen to cover up the ensuring struggle. 
The pair were arrested and committed for trial on 28 August 1855 on murder charges. The trial was held in the Court of General Quarter Sessions on 3 October 1855 before a crowded court room. Dr Bryan was called as a defence witness and testified that he had not seen any stragulation marks on Hurfield's neck. Under cross-examination by the Crown, he admitted that he had not passed a medical examination. He was also unable to explain how to use a stethoscope. On the second day of the trial, Larkin confessed to the murder.
Both Dodd and Larkin were found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. They were hanged on the following Monday in Fremantle Prison. Dixon was charged with conspiracy to forge the will. He pleaded guilty and was transported to Van Diemen's Land for the term of his natural life. Both Dodd and Larkin were the first executions in the new prison, and Larkin was the first woman to be hanged in Western Australia.

Theoretical planetology

Theoretical planetology, also known as theoretical planetary science is a branch of planetary sciences that developed in the 20th century.
Nature of the work.
[[File:Rayleigh-Taylor instability.jpg|thumb|right|Scientific visualisation of an extremely large simulation of a Raleigh-Taylor instability caused by two mixing fluids.
Theoretical planetologists, also known as theoretical planetary scientists, use modelling techniques to develop an understanding of the internal structure of planets by making assumptions about their chemical composition and the state of their materials, then calculating the radial distribution of various properties such as temperature, pressure, or density of material across the planet's internals.
Theoretical planetologists also use numerical models to understand how the Solar System planets were formed and develop in the future, their thermal evolution, their tectonics, how magnetic fields are formed in planetary interiors, how convection processes work in the cores and mantles of terrestrial planets and in the interiors of gas giants, how their lithospheres deform, the orbital dynamics of planetary satellites, how dust and ice is transported on the surface of some planets (such as Mars), and how the atmospheric circulation takes place over a planet.
Theoretical planetologists may use laboratory experiments to understand various phenomena analogous to planetary processes, such as convection in rotating fluids.
Theoretical planetologists make extensive use of basic physics, particularly fluid dynamics and condensed matter physics, and much of their work involves interpretation of data returned by space missions, although they rarely get actively involved in them.
Educational requirements.
Typically a theoretical planetologist will have to have had higher education in physics and theoretical physics, at PhD doctorate level.
Scientific visualisation.
Because of the use of scientific visualisation animation, theoretical planetology has a relationship with computer graphics. Example movies exhibiting this relation are the 4-minute "The Origin of the Moon"
Major successes.
One of the major successes of theoretical planetology is the prediction and subsequent confirmation of volcanism on Io.
The prediction was made by Stanton Peale who wrote a scientific paper claiming that Io must be volcanically active that was published one week before Voyager 1 encountered Jupiter. When Voyager 1 photographed Io in 1979, his theory was confirmed. Later photographs of Io by the Hubble Space Telescope and from the ground also showed volcanoes on Io's surface, and they were extensively studied and photographed by the Galileo orbiter of Jupiter from 1995-2003.
Criticism.
D. C. Tozer of University of Newcastle upon Tyne, writing in 1974, expressed the opinion that "it could and will be said that theoretical planetary science is a waste of time" until problems related to "sampling and scaling" are resolved, even though these problems cannot be solved by simply collecting further laboratory data.

Norwegian Air Force Academy

The Royal Norwegian Air Force Academy (RNoAFA) is the Norwegian Air Force’s college which conducts officer training for the RNoAF and the Norwegian Armed Forces. The school was established in 1949 and is one of the Armed Forces´ three military academies. The two others are the Army Academy and the Naval Academy. The students at the Armed Forces´ Academies are referred to as cadets and have full salary during education. The cadets at the RNoAFA have their own association, the Cadet Society (Kadettsamfunnet). The RNoAFA has a staff of 40 and a student body of 80 cadets and has since 1961 been located in Trondheim. The Commandant of the Royal Norwegian Air Force Academy is (from Autumn 2009) Colonel Ole Asbjørn Fauske.
College Education.
The undergraduate program at the RNoAFA is a 3-year Basic Officer Education (BAE). The RNoAFA has since 2005 been given status as an independent institution under the Act relating to Universities and University Colleges. The 3-year undergraduate program leads to a bachelor degree in military studies. Upon completion of the education at the RNoAFA the cadets are employed as commissioned officers in the Royal Norwegian Air Force.
The RNoAFAs main goal is to educate officers in the use of air power and how to lead air operations. The core of the undergraduate program is therefore "leadership" and "air power". These are studied from various academic approaches in a national and international context. The education is module based and is a combination of academic and military disciplines and practical exercises. The officer education is founded on the synergy between military skills, academic knowledge, physical capacity and personal development.
Research and development.
The RNoAFA, in addition to educating future Norwegian officers, conducts research and development (R&D). This activity is done within the main areas of air power (military theory, foreign- and security policy) and leadership. The RNoAFA has its own academic fields within these areas, and contributes with publication and lectures both nationally and internationally. The RNoAFA has a broad and close network with several institutes at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), and internationally within air power theory.

World War II.
Before the Nazi German invasion of Poland in 1939, Dzierżązna was the location of a large estate owned by two lawyers from Łódź, with a spacious manor house built by one of them. Poles were evicted within months and the property taken over by a "Volksdeutsch" Alfred Krinke from "Selbstschutz". In 1942 the manor house was appropriated by the German police, who established a concentration camp there, for Polish children 8–16 years of age. 
The children's camp, which was a sub-camp of the main children's camp in Łódź, named in , operated from January 1943 till January 1945. The adjacent fields were cultivated by the children to supply produce for the main concentration camp in the city. Polish girls were prepared in Dzierżązna for slave labour on German farms in the Reich, under the command of "SS Aufseherin" Sydomia Bayer. She is known to have killed one of the little girls named Urszula Kaczmarek, by flogging her to death in front of other children. The camp and sub-camp were the only complex of its kind established in occupied Poland. Other similar camps existed only in Croatia.

Michée Chauderon

Michée Chauderon (died 1652) was an alleged Swiss witch. She was the last person to be executed for sorcery in the city of Geneva in Switzerland.
Chauderon worked as a washerwoman. At one point, she had an argument with one of her employers, who accused her of theft. They then reported her for having summoned a demon into the body of their daughter. Chauderon was arrested and interrogated. The so-called devil's mark was found on her body, and she was tortured with strappado. During the torture, she said that one day, she had met Satan in her garden in the shape of a black man with the feet of a cow, and he had promised her wealth if she denounced God, which she had done. She was then judged guilty of sorcery and sentenced to be hanged and burned.
Between 1520 and 1681, 340 people were put on trial for sorcery in Geneva, and 150 were executed. Chauderon was the last person to be executed for sorcery in the city of Geneva, but not the last in Switzerland; that was to be Anna Göldi in 1782.

Darth Maul

Darth Maul is a fictional character in the science fiction franchise "Star Wars". Trained as Darth Sidious's first apprentice, he serves as a Sith Lord and a master of wielding a double-bladed lightsaber. He is the primary antagonist of ' (portrayed by Ray Park and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz) and a central villain for ' (voiced by Samuel Witwer).
Characteristics.
Concept and creation.
Series creator George Lucas had described Darth Maul as "a figure from your worst nightmare". Designer Iain McCaig thus offered Lucas a design based on a nightmare of his, which was rejected, but later inspired the Nightsister Sith witch Asajj Ventress in later "Star Wars" tales. One day, McCaig was trying to make "Sith Lord versions" of the art department crew, and drew David Dozoretz, head of the animations group, with a circuit board on his face. Lucas was intrigued by the circuit board idea, and McCaig started producing similar caricatures.
After getting frustrated with a drawing of production designer Gavin Bocquet, McCaig started covering it in tape. Both he and Lucas liked the result, described as "a kind of Rorschach pattern". The final drawing had McCaig's own face, with a pattern based on three things: a concept of a "flayed flesh face", face-painting of African tribes and further Rorschach experimentation (dropping ink onto paper, folding it in half then opening).
Darth Maul's head originally had feathers, based on prayer totems, but the Creature Effects crew led by Nick Dudman interpreted those feathers as horns, modifying his features into those common in popular Christian and other depictions of the Devil.
His clothing was also modified, from a tight body suit with a muscle pattern to the Sith robe based on samurai pleats, because the lightsaber battles involved much jumping and spinning. Another concept had Maul a masked figure, something that could rival Darth Vader, while the senatorial characters would sport painted and tattooed faces. It was later decided to apply this to Maul rather than the senator.
Portrayal.
Darth Maul was portrayed by martial artist Ray Park in "The Phantom Menace". The character was voiced by Peter Serafinowicz in "The Phantom Menace" and ', Gregg Berger for , Jess Harnell in ', ' and ', Stephen Stanton in ', Clint Bajakian in ', David W. Collins in "Star Wars The Force Unleashed" and ', and Samuel Witwer for '.
Appearances.
Film.
Introduced in "", Darth Maul was ordered by Darth Sidious to capture Queen Padmé Amidala.
On Tatooine, Maul fights Qui-Gon Jinn while approaching the Queen's starship. While Anakin Skywalker gets on board, Jinn engages Maul in a lightsaber duel. But the Jedi Master manages to get away from the Sith Lord.
During the film's climactic scene, Maul fights Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan Kenobi at the same time. Maul fights Qui-Gon while Obi-Wan becomes separated by laser gates. This leaves Qui-Gon to fight Maul alone. Maul eventually overpowers and stabs Qui-Gon in the stomach with his lightsaber, fatally injuring the Jedi Master. Obi-Wan witnesses this and rushes to fight Maul after the laser gates re-open. Obi-Wan cuts the Sith Lord's lightsaber in half but gets knocked down into a reactor chasm, and Maul kicks the Jedi Padawan's lightsaber into the chasm as well. However, Obi-Wan uses the Force to propel himself out of the chasm, and equips himself with Qui-Gon's lightsaber to slice Maul in half at the waist, after which the two pieces of Maul's body fall into the chasm.
Television.
On the CGI (set between ' and '), Darth Maul's origins were elaborated upon as a warrior of the Nightbrother clan on the planet Dathomir inhabited by the dominant Nightsister witchcraft society led by Mother Talzin and the tattoos covering his body are described as the markings of a warrior (in contrast to earlier sources which identify his bodyart as Sith Lord markings).
In the third season, the character is hinted to have survived to which Mother Talzin has Savage Opress find his long lost brother.
In the fourth season, Darth Maul himself returns. Having survived his bisection, Maul was striving to survive by any means and ended up on the junk planet Lotho Minor in the Outer Rim and turned into a cyborg with an arachnid-like lower half and managed to survive with the help of Anacondan Morley. Over the decade, Maul's mind sank into a melancholy insanity before he was found by Savage Opress. Savage's presence causes Maul to remember his downfall and resolves to have his revenge. Brought back to Dathomir in the aftermath of the Nightsisters' slaughter by the Separatists droids, Maul undergoes a purging of his madness and is given a pair of robotic legs crafted by Talzin's magic. With his mind restored, Maul learns that the Clone Wars have started without him. With Savage's help, he proceeds to extract revenge by luring Obi-Wan Kenobi into a trap by attacking a small village on Outer Rim planet Raydonia, knowing that the Jedi will come to assist. However, Asajj Ventress's unexpected appearance to collect a high bounty on Savage thwarts Maul's plan. Kenobi and Ventress duel Maul and Savage in the cargo bay of Savage's stolen ship but soon realize that they are outmatched and are forced to flee via the cockpit escape vessel. Maul decides not to pursue the jettisoned pod but to wait for another opportunity, realizing that the Jedi already know of his continued existence through the Force.
In the fifth season, Darth Maul continues to appear with Savage Opress. 
Maul clarifies to Savage that they're master and apprentice and they'll kill any one standing in their way as they attempt to set up their own criminal underworld. Needing followers, the Sith Lord brothers travel to Florrum and manages to convince Weequay pirate Jiro and his crew to join them and betray their leader Hondo Ohnaka. While Hondo is not easily fazed as Maul's recruits fell apart, Maul duels Kenobi while Savage fights Adi Galia and eventually kills the female Jedi Master. After Savage's arm is sliced off by Kenobi, Maul's legs blown off by the pirates and their ship damaged, the brothers escape in an escape pod. Maul and Savage are later found by the Death Watch Mandalorians led by Pre Vizsla. After Vizsla gives Maul a new set of legs and Savage a new arm, the Sith Lord brothers see this as an opportunity to get revenge on Kenobi and that Sith pretender. Maul offers Vizsla the chance to reclaim Mandalore by using his unsavory methods to recruit the Black Sun (after having Savage kill off its previous chain of command), the Pyke family (spice traders connected to Coruscant's crime families) and the Hutt Council (after impressing Jabba the Hutt with his determination) to create the criminal syndicate Shadow Collective. 
From there, Maul engineers Vizsla's rise to power by having his thug army attack Mandalore and have the Death Watch arrest them to make themselves look like heroes and demonize Duchess Satine Kryze's policy. But having expected Vizsla to betray them after they did the dirty work, Maul allows himself to be arrested and decides to replace Vizsla with the prime minister Almec that Satine locked away for corruption. Easily breaking free, Maul challenges Vizsla to a duel to take over the Death Watch and Mandalore, killing Vizsla and claiming his former co-conspirator's darksaber. He wins the loyalty of most Death Watch members but Bo Katan retreats along with those loyal to their previous leader. Maul then anticipates Satine being broken out of prison and her attempt to contact the Jedi Council as part of his plan to get Kenobi to Mandalore. Once Kenobi arrives and fails to escape with Satine, Maul captures Kenobi and kills Satine with his darksaber to make the Jedi Master suffer rather than be killed straight away and sent to a jail cell to be agonized. But while Kenobi is freed by the Night Owl rebels, Maul senses Darth Sidious arriving on Mandalore. Although impressed with his former apprentice's survival, the master declares the student a rival and uses the Force to push and choke the Zabrak brothers. In retaliation, the brothers draw their lightsabers, but Sidious also pulls out two of his own and engages them, promptly killing Savage in the duel. After Savage dies, Sidious reminds Maul of the and that he had been replaced. Enraged, Maul pulls out both his lightsaber and darksaber and proceeds to fight Sidious on equal ground with lightsabers, but is ultimately beaten by Sidious's power in the Force. Maul pleads for mercy, but Sidious ignores him and fires continuous streams of Force lightning at Maul, though he does remark that he has uses for his former apprentice.
Literature.
As portrayed in the novel "Darth Plagueis", Darth Plagueis sends his apprentice Sidious to the Force-rich world of Dathomir as a way of denying him his craving to visit a Force-rich Sith homeworld. A Dathomiri witch, or Night-sister, senses Palpatine's Force ability and approaches him. She assumes he is a Jedi and begs him to take her Zabrak infant son. She realizes Palpatine is not a Jedi, and explains how she is trying to save him from the threat of a Nightsister mother named Talzin so he can live freely; Maul's father was killed by tradition. It is implied that Maul has a twin brother and that Talzin is only aware of one child. Palpatine realizes the infant is strong in the Force and that the risk is too great for him to be found by the Jedi.
As portrayed in the novel "", Maul is kidnapped from his Jedi training by Sidious at an early age, and is trained as a Sith, having Sith tattoos put all over his body. Maul initially goes on countless missions of terror for his master, killing politicians, crime bosses, merchants and warlords.
Several sources depict Maul returning from the dead in several different forms. The story "Resurrection" from "Star Wars Tales 9" depicts a duplicate of Maul created by a cult (via an unspecified process) with the cult intending for Maul to replace Darth Vader as they believe that Vader is too tainted by his past as Anakin to be a true Sith, only for this Maul to be killed by Vader. The story "Phantom Menaces" in "Star Wars Tales" #17 (set after "") depicts Luke Skywalker visiting Maul's home planet of Iridonia in an ambassadorial capacity, where he faces a "solid state hologram" of Maul projected from Maul's salvaged brain as part of a scientist's attempt to recreate Maul as Iridonia's 'champion', Luke shutting down the life-support systems keeping the brain alive as he recognises the disruption that Maul's existence is causing in the Force.
In 2005, Dark Horse Comics published ', a compilation of comic art short stories. One story "Old Wounds", considered to be non-canonical to "Star Wars" lore, depicts Maul surviving his bisection at Obi-Wan's hands, replacing his missing bottom half with cybernetic replacements. He then follows Obi-Wan throughout the galaxy, finally tracking him down on Tatooine a few years prior to '. He engages Obi-Wan in a lightsaber duel but is killed by a blaster bolt to the head from Owen Lars.
In early 2012, a young adult biography of Darth Maul entitled "" was released by Scholastic. 2014 saw the release of , a novel in which Darth Maul-during the period in which he is being trained by Sidious while Darth Plagueis is still alive-is sent into an infamous galactic prison.
In popular culture.
Since the release of "The Phantom Menace", Darth Maul has proven to be a popular character. IGN named Darth Maul the 16th greatest "Star Wars" character, noting, "Of the countless characters to walk in and out of the "Star Wars" saga, none look or act more badass than Darth Maul."
Darth Maul related merchandise was popular among Hasbro "Star Wars" toy lines, with plastic recreations of his double bladed lightsaber and various action figures in his likeness developed. Darth Maul has been the focal point of the toy marketing campaign surrounding the 2012 re-release of "The Phantom Menace", being featured on the packaging for the toy line. The character's double-bladed lightsaber has influenced several homages and parodies, including an appearance in "The Simpsons" episode "Treehouse of Horror X" and a similar weapon being featured in the video game series "Ratchet and Clank". The character was also an unlockable character in the video game "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3". The character himself is parodied in during the "Futurama" episode "Lethal Inspection".
WWE Superstar Goldust recently paid homage to Darth Maul by applying make-up similar to Maul's. Former WCW wrestler L.A. Park has also adapted his formerly skull-like mask to look similar to Maul's face.
A pig version of Darth Maul appears as a playable character in "Angry Birds Star Wars II".

Adam Zero

Adam Zero is a ballet with music composed by Arthur Bliss and choreographed by Robert Helpmann, in 1946.
Background.
After World War I, Bliss developed an interest in ballet after seeing the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev in London. Bliss composed "Adam Zero" for the Sadler's Wells Ballet, in collaboration with Michael Benthall and Robert Helpmann with whom he had seen success with "Miracle in the Gorbals". The first performance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London on 6 April 1946, was conducted by Constant Lambert. The premiere dancers included the following:
Bliss considered "Adam Zero" his "most varied and exciting ballet score; the music is instinctively theatrical and strongly characterized". The orchestra is augmented by cor anglais, saxophone, tuba, two standard percussionists and two dance band percussionists, plus celesta and harp.
Sections.
The complete ballet runs for around 40 minutes.
Synopsis.
The ballet is an allegory of the cycle of man’s life; the world in which he lives is represented by a stage on which a ballet is being created: Adam is cast as the principal dancer, Omnipotence is represented by the Stage Director and Adam’s Fates by the Designer, Wardrobe Mistress and Dresser.
Adam falls in love, marries and achieves power. But his triumph is brief; his world crumbles about him, he is stripped of his glory, and a new generation (Understudy) takes his place. He seeks distraction in dissipation but everyone deserts him and he is left alone to face Death.

Fur

Fur is used in reference to the hair of non-human animals, usually mammals, particularly those with extensive body hair coverage. The term "pelage" (French, from Middle French, from "poil" hair, from Old French "peil", from Latin "pilus" - first known use circa 1828.) is sometimes used to refer to the body hair of an animal as a complete coat. "Fur" is also used to refer to animal pelts which have been processed into leather with the hair still attached. The words "fur" or "furry" are also used, more casually, to refer to hair-like growths or formations, particularly when the subject being referred to exhibits a dense coat of fine, soft "hairs."
Animal "fur", if layered, rather than grown as a single coat, may consist of short down hairs, long guard hairs, and, in some cases, medium awn hairs. Mammals with reduced amounts of fur are often called "naked", such as naked mole rat and naked dogs.
An animal with commercially valuable fur is known within the fur industry as a furbearer. The use of fur as clothing and/or decoration is considered controversial by some people: most animal welfare advocates object to the trapping and killing of wildlife, and to the confinement and killing of animals on fur farms.
Fur has been a major challenge for 3D computer graphics artists due to its visual complexity and physical properties. The first movie which made extensive use of CGI fur was Pixar's 2001 film "Monsters, Inc."
Composition.
Fur usually consists of two main layers:
Mammals with well-developed down and guard hairs also usually have large numbers of awn hairs. These begin their growth much as guard hairs do, but change their mode of growth, usually when less than half the length of the hair has emerged. This portion of the hair is called awn. The rest of the growth is thin and wavy, much like down hair. In many species of mammals, the awn hairs comprise the bulk of the visible coat. The proximal part of the awn hair shares the function of the down hairs, whereas the distal part aids the water-shedding function of the guard hairs, though their thin basal portion prevents their being erected like true guard hairs.
Mammals without fur.
Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals, however, several species or breeds have considerably reduced amounts of fur. These are often called "naked" or "hairless".
Natural selection.
Some mammals naturally have reduced amounts of fur. Some semiaquatic or aquatic mammals such as cetaceans, pinnipeds and hippopotamuses have evolved hairlessness, presumably to reduce resistance through water. The naked mole rat has evolves hairlessness, perhaps as an adaptation to their sub-terranian life-style. Two of the largest extant mammals, the elephant and the rhinoceros, are largely hairless. The hairless bat is mostly hairless but does have short bristly hairs around its neck, on its front toes, and around the throat sac, along with fine hairs on the head and tail membrane.
Humans are the only primate species that have undergone significant hair loss. The hairlessness of humans compared to related species may be due to loss of functionality in the pseudogene KRTHAP1 (which helps produce keratin) in the human lineage about 240,000 years ago. Mutations in the gene HR can lead to complete hair loss, though this is not typical in humans.
Sheep have not become hairless, however, their pelage is usually referred to as "wool" rather than fur.
Artificial selection.
Humans have artificially selected some domesticated mammalian species to have breeds that are hairless. There are several breeds of hairless cat, perhaps the most commonly known being the Sphynx cat. Similarly, there are several breeds of hairless dog. Other examples of artificially selected hairless animals include the hairless guinea-pig, nude mouse and the hairless rat.
Use in clothing.
In clothing, fur is usually leather with the hair retained for its aesthetic and insulating properties. Fur has long served as a source of clothing for hominoids including the Neanderthal. Animal furs used in garments and trim may be dyed bright colors or to mimic exotic animal patterns, or shorn down to imitate the feel of a soft velvet fabric. The term "a fur" is often used to refer to a fur coat, wrap, or shawl.
Usual animal sources for fur clothing and fur trimmed accessories include fox, rabbit, mink, beavers, ermine, otters, sable, seals, coyotes, chinchilla, raccoon, and possum. 
The import and sale of seal products was banned in the U.S. in 1972 over conservation concerns about Canadian seals. The import and sale is still banned even though the Marine Animal Response Society estimates the harp seal population is thriving at approximately 8 million. The import, export and sales of domesticated cat and dog fur were also banned in the U.S. under the Dog and Cat Protection Act of 2000.
The manufacturing of fur clothing involves obtaining animal pelts where the hair is left on the animal's processed skin. In contrast, making leather involves removing the hair from the hide or pelt and using only the skin. The use of wool involves shearing the animal's fleece from the living animal, so that the wool can be regrown but sheepskin shearling is made by retaining the fleece to the leather and shearing it. Shearling is used for boots, jackets and coats and is probably the most common type of skin worn.
Fur is also used to make felt. A common felt is made from beaver fur and is used in high-end cowboy hats.
Controversy.
Most animal rights activists are opposed to the trapping and killing of wildlife, and the confinement and killing of animals on fur farms. According to Humane Society International, over 8 million animals are trapped yearly for fur, while more than 30 million were raised in fur farms.
According to Statistics Canada, 2.6 million fur-bearing animals raised on farms were killed in 2010. Another 700,000 were killed for fur by traps. Based on a controversial animal rights video, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) allege that fur farming in China is particularly inhumane.

Richard Jordan (RAF officer)

Air Marshal Sir Richard Bowen Jordan KCB DFC ADC RAF (7 February 1902 – 24 April 1994) was a bomber pilot and squadron commander during the Second World War, a senior Royal Air Force officer during the Second World War and sixth Commandant of the Royal Observer Corps, in the post war period of the early 1950s.
Early Royal Air Force career.
Educated at Marlborough College Sir Richard was one of the very first cadets at the new RAF College Cranwell in 1921, at the age of 19, where he learned to fly. He represented the college at both cricket and rugby having been appointed in the rank of Flight Cadet Sergeant. On graduation he was granted a permanent commission in the rank of Pilot Officer in 1922 and posted as a pilot to No. 2 Squadron RAF. Promoted to Flying Officer in June 1924 he moved to No. 28 Squadron RAF in February 1926.
On 12 December 1928, Jordan was promoted to Flight Lieutenant and the following month he transferred to India as a Headquarters Staff officer at No. 2 (Indian Wing) Station, RAF Risalpur. Returning to the UK two years later he was held as a supernumerary officer at the RAF Central Depot before embarking on an eight-year secondment as a test pilot at the Royal Aircraft Establishment’s military experimental division at Farnborough. During his time there, he was promoted to Squadron Leader in 1936.
In January 1938 he temporarily ceased flying duties and took up an appointment as a Staff Officer in the RAF’s Directorate of Peace Organisation. Returning to operational flying Jordan was promoted to Wing Commander and appointed as Officer Commanding No. 83 Squadron RAF in August 1939. Posted to RAF Manston briefly as Station Commander he then became Officer Commanding No. 214 Squadron RAF where he remained on combat duty until July 1944. On the night of 2 June 1941 Jordan took off from RAF Stradishall in Vickers Wellington No. W5450 for a bombing operation over Berlin. His squadron successfully attacked the target and turned for home. At 06:00, having crossed the English coast, Jordan’s aircraft stalled and crashed 7 miles south west of Bury St Edmunds. Although it crashed into a copse of trees, there was no fire and most of the crew were unhurt, returning to the Stradishall on the back of a farm cart. Jordan was awarded with the DFC on 22 August 1941.
Over a three-year period he held several transient ranks in quick succession, including Temporary Group Captain, Acting Air Commodore, Group Captain (War Substantive) and Temporary Air Commodore while serving as the Director of Overseas Transport Operations.
Just after the Second World War finished Jordan was promoted to the substantive rank of Air Commodore and served as AOC, RAF India & Pakistan from July 1947 until February 1948 when he was appointed as AOC, RAF Gibraltar.
Royal Observer Corps.
On 1 February 1949 Jordan took over the appointment as Commandant Royal Observer Corps at RAF Bentley Priory from Air Commodore the Earl of Bandon. In April 1949 Jordan was additionally appointed Aide de Camp to King George VI. Jordan was Commandant ROC when, on 1 March 1950 the Air Officer Commanding in Chief, RAF Fighter Command assumed direct administrative control of the Corps. Under this change Headquarters Royal Observer Corps continued to operate in its existing form but assumed a status that was comparable with that of a Fighter Command group headquarters.
After lengthy negotiations with Buckingham Palace staff, Jordan formally invited His Majesty King George VI to assume the position of Air Commodore in Chief of the ROC. On 11 April 1950 in recognition of the Corps' record of service during the twenty-five years of its existence, His Majesty King George VI honoured the Corps by accepting the invitation.
Later Royal Air Force appointments.
On 20 March 1951 Jordan handed over the Commandant ROC position to Air Commodore G H Vasse. Jordan was promoted to Air Vice Marshal and appointed as AOC No. 25 Group RAF. In 1953 he became Director General of RAF Organisation, an appointment he held until January 1956. That month he was promoted to Air Marshal and took up his final posting as AOC in C of RAF Maintenance Command. A Companion of the Order of the Bath since 1947 he was further honoured by being Knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours of May 1956. In June 1958 his personal De Havilland Devon crashed near Largs in Scotland while apparently en route to his headquarters at RAF Andover to collect passengers: he was not on board at the time.
Jordan retired from the RAF on 2 June 1958. He died on 24 April 1994 at the age of 92.

Funny animal

Funny animal is a cartooning term for the genre of comics and animated cartoons in which the main characters are anthropomorphic or talking animals, with human-like personality traits. The characters themselves may also be called "funny animals".
While many funny animal stories are light-hearted and humorous, the genre is not exclusively comedic. Dark or serious stories featuring characters of this sort can also be grouped under the "funny animals" category, sometimes referred to as "anthropomorphics" to avoid confusion over the range of genres. These stories may intersect with any other genre or group of genres, including historical fiction, science fiction, superhero, western, slapstick comedy, children's entertainment, and satire.
History.
Moving pictures.
The funny animal genre evolved in the 1920s and 1930s, as blackface became less socially acceptable. Early black-and-white funny animals, including Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Mickey Mouse (perhaps the most enduring of the kind), Foxy the Fox, Felix the Cat and Flip the Frog, maintained certain aspects of the blackface design, including (especially with the advent of sound film) heavy emphasis on song and dance routines. The increased use of Technicolor and other color film processes in the 1930s allowed for greater diversity in the ability to design new "funny animals", leading to a much wider array of funny animal shorts and the near-total demise (except for Mickey Mouse and a few other Disney characters of the era) of the blackface characters. Song and dance fell out of favor and were largely replaced by comedy and satire. The "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies" shorts by Warner Bros. Animation, for instance, introduced dozens of funny animals, many of whom have reached iconic status in American culture. Other notable funny animals from the color film era included Walter Lantz's Woody Woodpecker, MGM's Tom and Jerry (among many others), and Paul Terry's Heckle and Jeckle.
Television changed the dynamic of animation, in that although budgets were much smaller and schedules much tighter, this prompted a shift from the physical comedy that predominated film shorts to more dialogue-oriented jokes (including celebrity impressions and one-liner jokes). Hanna-Barbera Productions focused almost exclusively on these kinds of funny animal TV series in the late 1950s and early 1960s, creating an extensive line of funny animal series ("Yogi Bear" being one of the most enduring franchises). Jay Ward Productions also produced "The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show", a series representative of the genre (albeit with much stronger Cold War overtones than the shows of Hanna-Barbera exhibited).
By the 1970s, most funny animals had lost their lead status and had been relegated to members of an ensemble cast of mostly humans (e.g. "Scooby-Doo") or supporting characters. Funny animals and animal-like characters made a brief comeback in the late 1980s and into the 1990s (most notably through various Warner Bros. and Disney television creations, and through the decidedly cruder work of Ralph Bakshi and John Kricfalusi). The subsequent years also had numerous successful animated feature film franchises that featured funny animal characters like DreamWorks Animation's "Madagascar", "Shrek" and "Kung Fu Panda" and Blue Sky Studios's "Ice Age". Animators have created increasingly more unusual examples of funny animals in this era, including Perry the Platypus (from Disney's "Phineas and Ferb") and SpongeBob SquarePants (from the Nickelodeon TV series of the same name).
Print media.
In the 1940s, Fawcett Comics published a comic book entitled "Funny Animals", featuring such characters as Hoppy the Marvel Bunny, an anthropomorphic rabbit version of Captain Marvel. Beginning in the 1980s, there was a subgenre of original funny animal comic books with subject matter that were created largely for mature readers. These creations included the political science fiction allegory in "Albedo Anthropomorphics", the sexually explicit serial drama of "Omaha the Cat Dancer" and the Pulitzer Prize winning graphic Holocaust narrative, "Maus". 
Comic strips have long been an outlet for funny animal characters. Krazy Kat was a popular early comic strip featuring the titular cat and its companionship with a mouse named Ignatz. Snoopy, from the "Peanuts" comic strip, was frequently used as comic relief. Almost all of the non-human characters in the comic strip "Garfield" fit the category. In the cases of "Peanuts" and "Garfield", the animal characters' words are portrayed in thought balloons instead of spoken dialogue.

Talking animal

A talking animal or speaking animal refers to any non-human animal which can produce sounds (or gestures) resembling those of a human language. Many species or groups of animals have developed forms of Animal Communication Systems (ACS) which to some appear to be a verbal language. These are not defined as language in the human sense—they lack grammar, syntax, recursion, and displacement. Studies in animal cognition have been successful in teaching some animals speech or sign, similar to sign language, but not defined as such. In the case of Koko the gorilla, for example, Koko was unable to break away from the here-and-now (displacement) in her signs. This among others represent various hallmarks of human language that Koko and similar animals have been unable to achieve.
On imitation and understanding.
The term refers to animals which can imitate (though not necessarily understand) human speech. Parrots, for example, repeat things nonsensically through exposure. It is an anthropomorphism to call this human speech, as it has no semantic grounding.
Clever Hans was a horse that was claimed to have been able to perform arithmetic and other intellectual tasks. After formal investigation in 1907, psychologist Oskar Pfungst demonstrated that the horse was not actually performing these mental tasks, but was watching the reaction of his human observers. The horse was responding directly to involuntary cues in the body language of the human trainer, who had the faculties to solve each problem, and was unaware that he was providing such cues.
On formality of animal language.
A "formal language" requires a communication with a syntax as well as semantics. It is not sufficient for one to communicate information or even use symbols to communicate ideas. It has yet to be demonstrated that any animal species has developed a formal language, or been able to learn a formal language.
Researchers have attempted to teach great apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos) spoken language with poor results, and sign language with significantly better results. However, even the best communicating great ape has shown an inability to grasp the idea of syntax and grammar, instead communicating at best at the same level as a pidgin language in humans. They are expressive and communicative, but lack the formality that remains unique to human speech.
Modern research shows that the key difference is the animal's lack of asking questions and that formal syntax is merely a superficial detail. There are other differences as well, including poor precision, as shown by Kanzi the bonobo used the lexigram for "chase" interchangeably with that for "get". Research supports the idea that the linguistic limitations in animals are due to limited general brainpower (as opposed to lack of a specific module), and that words are created by breaking down sentences into pieces, making grammar more basic than semantics. The statement that syntax is the key difference between human and animal language is dubious.

Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah

Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah (, born 5 January 1942) is a member of the Kuwaiti ruling family and prime minister.
Career.
Sabah was first appointed Prime Minister of Kuwait on 4 December 2011. On 5 December 2012, Kuwait's ruler reappointed him as prime minister following the parliamentary election on 1 December 2012. He also served as first deputy prime minister and minister of defense.
Sheikh Jaber began his career an advisor at the administrative affairs department in the Amiri Diwan in 1968 and served there until 1971. Then, he served as director of the administrative affairs department in the Diwan until 1975. He went on to become assistant undersecretary of administrative and financial affairs at the Diwan until 1979.
In that year, he became a governor, serving from 1979 to 1985 at Hawally and from 1985 to 1986 at Ahmedy. He was made the minister of social and labor affairs and served in office from 1986 to 1988. He was the minister of information from 1988 to 1990. 
After the liberation of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber became advisor to the office of the Amir, a position he held until 2001. On 14 February of that year that he was named as deputy prime minister and minister of defense.
In 2004, Sheikh Jaber became chairman of the supreme council of environment. In 2006, he was appointed first deputy prime minister, as well as minister of interior and minister of defense. The following year, he was named first deputy prime minister and minister of defense. In 2010, Sheikh Jaber became chairman of the supreme council for the disabled.
In January 2014 it was announced that he had reshuffled his five-month old cabinet replacing seven members, including the oil and finance ministers, and raising the number of Islamists to four. The move came two weeks after all the ministers submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Shaikh Jaber Mubarak Al Sabah after several cabinet members, including the premier himself, were quizzed by MPs. Emir Shaikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, who is the head of the state, on Monday accepted the resignation of seven of the 15 ministers and decreed the appointment of new faces. The new cabinet line-up includes a new oil minister, Ali Al Omair, a lawmaker who is a senior member of the Islamist Salaf Alliance. He replaced Mustafa Al Shamali, who served in the post for just five months after serving several years as finance minister.
Activities.
He is a patron of the Sheikh Mubarak Al Hamad Al Sabah Journalism award, created in 2008 to honor excellence in Kuwaiti journalism. 
Personal life.
Sheikh Jaber is married and has children. He is an avid falconer and actively engaged in many philanthropic initiatives worldwide. 
Titles, styles and honours.
Honours and awards.
In 2007, King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa awarded Sheikh Jaber the "Medal of King Issa First Class," following his visit to Bahrain where he took part in the Middle East Forum on Internal and World Security.
In 2009, he became the first Arab to be awarded Japan's highest honor conferred on foreigners, Order of the Rising Sun, Grand Cordon. The Imperial Decoration of "Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun" was bestowed by Japan's Emperor Akihito at a ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The distinction was awarded in recognition of Sheikh Jaber's contributions to promoting mutual understanding as well as political, diplomatic, and environmental ties between Kuwait and Japan.

Anthropomorphism

Anthropomorphism, or personification, is attribution of human form or other characteristics to anything other than a human being. Examples include depicting deities with human form and ascribing human emotions or motives to forces of nature, such as hurricanes or earthquakes.
Anthropomorphism has ancient roots as a literary device in storytelling, and also in art. Most cultures have traditional fables with anthropomorphised animals, which can stand or talk like humans, as characters.
The word "anthropomorphism" was first used in the mid-1700s. The word derives from the Greek ('), "human", and ('), "shape" or "form".
Pre-history.
From the beginnings of human behavioural modernity in the Upper Paleolithic, about 40,000 years ago, examples of zoomorphic (animal-shaped) works of art occur that may represent the earliest evidence we have of anthropomorphism. One of the oldest known is an ivory sculpture, the Löwenmensch, Germany, a human-shaped figurine with the head of a lioness or lion, determined to be about 32,000 years old.
It is not possible to say what exactly these prehistoric artworks represent. A more recent example is The Sorcerer, an enigmatic cave painting from the Trois-Frères Cave, Ariège, France: the figure's significance is unknown, but it is usually interpreted as some kind of great spirit or master of the animals. In either case there is an element of anthropomorphism.
This anthropomorphic art has been linked by archaeologist Steven Mithen with the emergence of more systematic hunting practices in the Upper Palaeolithic (Mithen 1998). He proposes that these are the product of a change in the architecture of the human mind, an increasing fluidity between the natural history and social intelligences, where anthropomorphism allowed hunters to empathetically identify with hunted animals and better predict their movements.
In religion and mythology.
In religion and mythology, anthropomorphism refers to the perception of a divine being or beings in human form, or the recognition of human qualities in these beings.
Ancient mythologies frequently represented the divine as deities with human forms and qualities. They resemble human beings not only in appearance and personality; they exhibited many human behaviors that were used to explain natural phenomena, creation, and historical events. The deities fell in love, married, had children, fought battles, wielded weapons, and rode horses and chariots. They feasted on special foods, and sometimes required sacrifices of food, beverage, and sacred objects to be made by human beings. Some anthropomorphic deities represented specific human concepts, such as love, war, fertility, beauty, or the seasons. Anthropomorphic deities exhibited human qualities such as beauty, wisdom, and power, and sometimes human weaknesses such as greed, hatred, jealousy, and uncontrollable anger. Greek deities such as Zeus and Apollo were often depicted in human form exhibiting both commendable and despicable human traits.
Anthropomorphism in this case is referred to as anthropotheism.
From the perspective of adherents to religions in which humans were created in the form of the divine, the phenomenon may be considered theomorphism, or the giving of divine qualities to humans.
Anthropomorphism has cropped up as a Christian heresy, particularly prominently with the Audians in 3rd century Syria, but also in 4th century Egypt and 10th century Italy. This often was based on a literal interpretation of Genesis 1:27: "So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them".
Criticism.
Some religions, scholars, and philosophers objected to anthropomorphic deities. The Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570–480 BCE) said that "the greatest god" resembles man "neither in form nor in mind". Both Judaism and Islam reject an anthropomorphic deity, believing that God is beyond human comprehension. Judaism's rejection of an anthropomorphic deity grew during the Hasmonean period (circa 300 BCE), when Jewish belief incorporated some Greek philosophy. Judaism's rejection grew further after the Islamic Golden Age in the tenth century, which Maimonides codified in the twelfth century, in his 13 principles of Jewish faith.
Hindus do not reject the concept of a deity in the abstract unmanifested, but note practical problems. Lord Krishna said in the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 12, Verse 5, that it is much more difficult for people to focus on a deity as the unmanifested than one with form, using anthropomorphic icons (murtis), because people need to perceive with their senses.
In "Faces in the Clouds", anthropologist Stewart Guthrie proposes that all religions are anthropomorphisms that originate in the brain's tendency to detect the presence or vestiges of other humans in natural phenomena.
In literature.
Religious texts.
There are various examples of personification as a literary device in both Hebrew Bible and Christian New Testament and also in the texts of some other religions.
Fables.
Anthropomorphism, sometimes referred to as personification, is a well established literary device from ancient times. It extends back to before Aesop's Fables in 6th century BCE Greece and the collections of linked fables from India, the "Jataka Tales" and "Panchatantra", which employ anthropomorphised animals to illustrate principles of life. Many of the stereotypes of animals that are recognised today, such as the wiley fox and the proud lion, can be found in these collections. Aesop's anthropomorphisms were so familiar by the 1st century CE that they coloured the thinking of at least one philosopher:
Apollonius noted that the fable was created to teach wisdom through fictions that are meant to be taken as fictions, contrasting them favourably with the poets' stories of the deities that are sometimes taken literally. Aesop, "by announcing a story which everyone knows not to be true, told the truth by the very fact that he did not claim to be relating real events". The same consciousness of the fable as fiction is to be found in other examples across the world, one example being a traditional Ashanti way of beginning tales of the anthropomorphic trickster-spider Anansi: "We do not really mean, we do not really mean that what we are about to say is true. A story, a story; let it come, let it go."
Fairy tales.
Anthropomorphic motifs have been common in fairy tales from the earliest ancient examples set in a mythological context to the great collections of the Brothers Grimm and Perrault. The "Tale of Two Brothers" (Egypt, 13th century BCE) features several talking cows and in "Cupid and Psyche" (Rome, 2nd century CE) Zephyrus, the west wind, carries Psyche away. Later an ant feels sorry for her and helps her in her quest.
Modern literature.
Building on the popularity of fables and fairy tales, specifically "children's" literature began to emerge in the 19th century with works such as "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" (1865) by Lewis Carroll, "The Adventures of Pinocchio" (1883) by Carlo Collodi and "The Jungle Book" (1894) by Rudyard Kipling, all employing anthropomorphic elements. This continued in the 20th century with many of the most popular titles having anthropomorphic characters, examples being "The Tales of Beatrix Potter" (1901 onwards), "The Wind in the Willows" (1908) by Kenneth Grahame, "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" by C. S. Lewis and "Winnie-the-Pooh" (1926) by A. A. Milne.
In many of these stories the animals can be seen as representing facets of human personality and character. As John Rowe Townsend remarks, discussing "The Jungle Book" in which the boy Mowgli must rely on his new friends the bear Baloo and the black panther Bagheera, "The world of the jungle is in fact both itself and our world as well". Another notable work is George Orwell's "Animal Farm".
The fantasy genre developed from mythological, fairy tale and Romance motifs and characters, sometimes with anthropomorphic animals. The best-selling examples of the genre are "The Hobbit"" (1937) and The Lord of the Rings" (1954–1955), both by J. R. R. Tolkien, books peopled with talking creatures such as ravens, spiders and the dragon Smaug and a multitude of anthropomorphic goblins and elves. John D. Rateliff calls this the "Doctor Dolittle Theme" in his book "The History of the Hobbit" and Tolkien saw this anthropomorphism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: "...The first men to talk of 'trees and stars' saw things very differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was "myth-woven and elf-patterned".'
In the 20th century, the children's picture book market expanded massively. Perhaps a majority of picture books have some kind of anthropomorphism, with popular examples being "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" (1969) by Eric Carle and "The Gruffalo" (1999) by Julia Donaldson.
Anthropomorphism in literature and other media led to a sub-culture known as Furry fandom, which promotes and creates stories and artwork involving anthropomorphic animals, and the examination and interpretation of humanity through anthropomorphism.
Various Japanese manga have used anthropomorphism as the basis of their story. Examples include "Squid Girl" (anthropomorphised squid), "" (humanised countries) and "Upotte!!" (humanised guns).
In film, television, and video games.
Film.
Some of the most notable examples are the Walt Disney characters, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit; the Looney Tunes characters, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig; and an array of others from the 1920s to present day.
In the films "Cars" (2006) and "Cars 2" (2011), all the characters are anthropomorphized vehicles.
In the motion picture "Fantastic Mr. Fox" (2009), most of the characters are anthropomorphic animals very similar to the style seen in the Furry Fandom. They are given especially human characteristics such as body shape, hands, and clothing, among other things.
Television.
Since the 1960s, anthropomorphism has also been represented in various animated TV shows such as "Biker Mice From Mars" (1993–1996) and "" (1993–1995). "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", first aired in 1987, features four pizza-loving anthropomorphic turtles with a great knowledge of ninjutsu, led by their anthropomorphic rat sensei, Master Splinter.
"TUGS" (1988) is a British children's series, set in the 1920s, featuring anthropomorphic tugboats. They moved like real boats but would sometimes perform certain actions without the aid of humans although not seen. Like real boats they obeyed maritime laws but would sometimes perform actions of their own will.
In the American animated TV series "Family Guy", one of the show's main characters, Brian, is a dog. Brian shows many human characteristics – he walks upright, talks, smokes, and drinks Martinis – but also acts like a normal dog in other ways; for example he cannot resist chasing a ball.
A Canadian–New Zealand-American animated TV show called "Turbo Dogs" (2008) starred anthropomorphised dog characters. In 2010, a French-American animated TV show "The Mysteries of Alfred Hedgehog" was mostly consisted of woodland anthropomorphic characters.
A British TV series, "Thomas and Friends", features anthropomorphised trains, airplanes, helicopters and cars.
Both the YouTube series "The Annoying Orange" and its American television adaptation "The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange" feature anthropomorphised fruits and vegetables.
An American–Canadian series, "Johnny Test", features a talking dog named Dukey, who is genetically engineered by the title character’s sisters, which they all try to keep a secret from anyone else (except in a couple of episodes).
Video Games.
"Sonic the Hedgehog", a game released in 1991, features a speedy blue hedgehog as the protagonist. This series' characters are almost all anthropomorphic animals such as foxes, cats, and other hedgehogs who are able to speak and walk on their hind legs like normal humans. As with most anthropomorphisms of animals, clothing is of little or no importance, where some characters may be fully clothed while some only wear shoes and gloves.
Another example in video games is "Super Mario Bros.", which was released in 1985. Some of the characters include Yoshi, a dinosaur who is able to talk, run and jump, and Bowser, a "Koopa" that is able to perform most human characteristics, with some exceptions, as he can breathe fire.
Radio programs.
The Signature Series is a radio program based in Canada that explores the personality traits of the 24 keys of western music by personifying them and giving each key a gender, a story and specific character traits.
Art history.
Claes Oldenburg.
Claes Oldenburg's soft sculptures are commonly described as anthropomorphic. Depicting common household objects, Oldenburg's sculptures were considered Pop Art. Reproducing these objects, often at a greater size than the original, Oldenburg created his sculptures out of soft materials. The anthropomorphic qualities of the sculptures were mainly in their sagging and malleable exterior which mirrored the not so idealistic forms of the human body. In "Soft Light Switches" Oldenburg creates a household light switch out of Vinyl. The two identical switches, in a dulled orange, insinuate nipples. The soft vinyl references the aging process as the sculpture wrinkles and sinks with time.
Minimalism.
In the essay "Art and Objecthood", Michael Fried makes the case that "Literalist art" (Minimalism) becomes theatrical by means of anthropomorphism. The viewer engages the minimalist work, not as an autonomous art object, but as a theatrical interaction. Fried references a conversation in which Tony Smith answers questions about his "six-foot cube, Die."
Q: Why didn't you make it larger so that it would loom over the observer?
A: I was not making a monument.
Q: then why didn't you make it smaller so that the observer could see over the top?
A: I was not making an object.
Fried implies an anthropomorphic connection by means of "a surrogate person-that is, a kind of statue."
The minimalist decision of "hollowness" in much of their work, was also considered by Fried, to be "blatantly anthropomorphic." This "hollowness" contributes to the idea of a separate inside; an idea mirrored in the human form. Fried considers the Literalist art's "hollowness" to be "biomorphic" as it references a living organism.
Post Minimalism.
Curator Lucy Lippard's Eccentric Abstraction show, in 1966, sets up Briony Fer's writing of a post minimalist anthropomorphism. Reacting to Fried's interpretation of minimalist art's "looming presence of objects which appear as actors might on a stage", Fer interprets the artists in Eccentric Abstraction to a new form of anthropomorphism. She puts forth the thoughts of Surrealist writer Roger Caillous, who speaks of the "spacial lure of the subject, the way in which the subject could inhabit their surroundings." Caillous uses the example of an insect who "through camouflage does so in order to become invisible... and loses its distinctness." For Fer, the anthropomorphic qualities of imitation found in the erotic, organic sculptures of artists Eva Hesse and Louise Bourgeois, are not necessarily for strictly "mimetic" purposes. Instead, like the insect, the work must come into being in the "scopic field... which we cannot view from outside."
In science.
In the scientific community, the use of anthropomorphic language that suggests animals have intentions and emotions has traditionally been deprecated as indicating a lack of objectivity. Biologists have been warned to avoid assumptions that animals share any of the same mental, social, and emotional capacities of humans, and to rely instead on strictly observable evidence. In 1927 Ivan Pavlov wrote that animals should be considered "without any need to resort to fantastic speculations as to the existence of any possible subjective states". More recently, "The Oxford companion to animal behaviour" (1987) advised that "one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion". Some scientists, like William M Wheeler (writing apologetically of his use of anthropormorphism in 1911), have used anthropomorphic language in metaphor to make subjects more humanly comprehensible or memorable.
Despite the impact of Charles Darwin's ideas in "The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals" (Konrad Lorenz in 1965 called him a "patron saint" of ethology) ethology has generally focused on behaviour, not on emotion in animals. Though in other ways Darwin was and is the epitome of science, his acceptance of anecdote and anthropomorphism stands out in sharp contrast to the lengths to which later scientists would go to overlook apparent mindedness, selfhood, individuality and agency:
The study of great apes in their own environment has changed attitudes to anthropomorphism. In the 1960s the three so-called "Leakey's Angels", Jane Goodall studying chimpanzees, Dian Fossey studying gorillas and Biruté Galdikas studying orangutans, were all accused of "that worst of ethological sins – anthropomorphism". The charge was brought about by their descriptions of the great apes in the field; it is now more widely accepted that empathy has an important part to play in research.
Frans de Waal wrote: "To endow animals with human emotions has long been a scientific taboo. But if we do not, we risk missing something fundamental, about both animals and us." Alongside this has come increasing awareness of the linguistic abilities of the great apes and the recognition that they are tool-makers and have individuality 
Writing of cats in 1992, veterinarian Bruce Fogle points to the fact that "both humans and cats have identical neurochemicals and regions in the brain responsible for emotion" as proof that "it is not anthropomorphic to credit cats with emotions such as jealousy".
Antonym.
In the context of the sciences, the term "anthropomorphism" has been deprecated to the point that, when applied to a scientist, the term functions as a pejorative (see above). However, there is also a risk of straying off the path of objectivity when scientists choose to assume that only humans possess any degree of certain traits. This assumption is called anthropocentrism, practitioners of which either believe in or unintentionally form an outlook of human exceptionalism. Darwin — to the chagrin of many religious philosophers — dismissed these ideas of human exceptionalism in his book "The Descent of Man" by saying that our differences are "only in degree and not in kind".
In Sports, Expositions, Olympics.
Anthropomorphic animals are often used as mascots for sports teams, World's Fair, and Olympics.

Leaves from Satan's Book

"Leaves from Satan's Book" () is a 1921 Danish drama film directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer and starring Helge Nissen. 
Plot.
Satan has been cast out from hell and banished to Earth under decree of heaven. He can return, only through a series of temptations. However, for every soul who gives in to his tempting, one hundred years are added to his sentence. For every soul who resists, one thousand years are removed from his sentence. The film follows Satan throughout much of recorded history.
Quoting the film directly, God said to Satan, "But know thee that for each man yielding to thy temptation the doom upon thee shalt be prolonged by one hundred years, but for each one resisting thee, thou shalt be relieved of 1000 years of thy judgment. Get thee away and continue thy evil doings."

Clone trooper

The clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic are soldiers in the "Star Wars" universe, cloned from Jango Fett, a Mandalorian bounty hunter. They first appeared in ', and returned in ' where they were played primarily by Temuera Morrison. In the two "Clone Wars" animated TV shows, they are voiced by Andre Sogliuzzo and Dee Bradley Baker.
Clone troopers comprised the bulk of the Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. They are depicted as the main part of the armed forces of the Galactic Republic in its final years, becoming one of the largest armies ever assembled, only surpassed by the Separatist Droid Army. Nearing the end of the clone wars, they were ordered to slay the Jedi. This famous Jedi purge was known as 'Order 66'. After the Clone Wars, they served as the nucleus for the armed forces of the Galactic Empire, eventually becoming the Imperial Stormtroopers.
History.
In "Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones", it was revealed that (10 years prior) Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas had ordered the creation of a clone army for the Republic. The genetic template of the clone troopers was Jango Fett, one of the most feared bounty hunters in the Galaxy. In exchange for "considerable" payment and an unaltered clone "son," Boba Fett, Jango provided his genetic material and Mandalorian battle training to the cloners on Kamino. All clone troopers' genes were manipulated; they had accelerated aging, making them grow and mature twice as fast as a normal human, and were made more loyal and willing to follow orders than their donor. The clone troopers were outfitted with armor styled after Mandalorian battle armor, (notably the helmet and its T-shaped visor), and armed with weapons and vehicles produced in secret by Kuat Drive Yards, Rendili Stardrive, and Sienar Fleet Systems.
The Battle of Geonosis marked the first deployment of the clone troopers as well as the beginning of the Clone Wars. After Geonosis, clone trooper armies were led by Jedi generals, who were in turn accompanied by Clone Commanders. The clone troopers eventually carried out Order 66 at the behest of Chancellor Palpatine, turning the clones against their Jedi generals. This marked the end of the Clone Wars, as well as the death of the Old Republic. After the war and the birth of the Galactic Empire, the clone trooper army evolved into the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps. This transition also resulted in the decrease of clones, and the increase of natural soldiers, which lowered the quality of the Empire's troops.
According to "Star Wars Battlefront II", the surviving clone troopers were fitted with new armor and weapons, and became the Imperial Stormtrooper corps of the Empire. Later, a combination of natural-born humans as well as clones from different donor templates would be incorporated into the Stormtrooper corps. One of the few Stormtrooper legions to remain completely composed of Fett clones throughout the era of the Empire was the 501st Legion.
The Clone wars TV series goes more in depth into Order 66. Clone Trooper Fives discovers chips implanted in all the minds of the Clones. When activated the Clones enter a hypnotized like state and must carry out the Order against their will. Ultimately The Jedi remain unaware of Order 66 and Palpatine's plan carry on. This depiction directly contradicts other depictions of Order 66, as their it was depicted as a contingency order, which the Clones followed willingly. The Clone wars is considered canon but it is unknown if the Contingency order explanation still factors into the Star Wars Canon.
Specialized clone troopers.
Within the film series and in the Star Wars Expanded Universe media, a number of specialized trooper units are seen, including elite special forces units such as the "Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos" (ARC troopers), and Null ARCs, who usually work alone, and Republic Commandos, who operate in squads of four, with each member a specialist of some kind, created for the video game "" and reappearing in the "Star Wars Republic Commando" series novels by Karen Traviss. All clone commandos and ARCs were trained by Mandalorian mercenaries; the Elite Clone Troopers are known as Shadow Troopers.
The style and colour of a clone troopers armor often varies depending on their rank, specialisation, regiment or environment, for example, the clone troopers on Kashyyk wear camouflage green scout-style armour whereas the 501st legion wears standard white armour with blue accents. Another example is the aquatic "SCUBA" troopers, who appear in the animated series "". SCUBA troopers are equipped with high-tech breathing apparatuses and long range blaster rifles. Notable units in the novels are Delta Squad and Omega Squad.
Clone trooper armor.
No physical clone trooper costume was produced for their first onscreen appearance. As revealed in the audio commentary of "", every single clone trooper in the film is a computer generated image. In fact, the only thing present on the set was the actor, whose head was used during scenes requiring a clone's face.
In "", the armor is redesigned, but remains computer generated. Within the fictional history of the "Star Wars" universe, this is the basis of the Imperial Stormtrooper armor and shows a gradual evolution in design toward the armor worn in episodes III-VI, known as "Phase II" armor. The actual armor never changes, but the helmet progresses.
Ranks.
Originally clone troopers were identified in rank by the color of their armor, as in this chart below. However, by "Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith", colors became associated with a trooper's legion affiliation.
Once the Galactic Empire is established, all armor uniforms of the clone-troopers, now re-classified as 'storm-troopers' and issued new armor, are once again all white, with no outward sign of rank, legion, or other unit affiliation.

Genie (feral child)

Genie (born 1957) is the pseudonym of a feral child who was the victim of extraordinarily severe abuse, neglect and social isolation. Her circumstances are recorded prominently in the annals of abnormal child psychology. Born in Arcadia, California, United States, Genie was locked alone in a room from the age of 20 months to 13 years, 7 months, almost always strapped to a child's toilet or bound in a crib with her arms and legs completely immobilized. During this time she was never exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire a first language during childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970.
In the first several years after Genie's life and circumstances came to light, psychologists, linguists and other scientists focused a great deal of attention on Genie's case, seeing in her near-total isolation an opportunity to study many aspects of human development. Upon finding that she had not learned language as a child, linguists saw Genie as potentially being an important way to gain further insight into the processes controlling language acquisition skills and linguistic development. Extensive observation of their new-found human subject enabled them to publish multiple academic works testing theories and hypotheses identifying critical periods during which humans learn to understand and use language.
After being found Genie was initially cared for at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and her subsequent placements eventually gave rise to rancorous debate. After approximately eight months at Children's Hospital, she was moved to one foster home for a month and a half; the first of several moves. Upon removal she was then placed in the home of the scientist who was heading the research team studying her, where she lived for approximately four years and where most of the testing and research on her was conducted. Soon after turning 18 she went back to live with her mother, who could not adequately care for her; after a few months she was then placed in a series of at least six institutions for disabled adults, where she experienced further physical and emotional abuse. Cut off from almost all of the people who had studied her, her newly acquired language and behavioral skills very rapidly regressed. Although psychologists and linguists have continued to write about Genie's development long after the time she was being studied, no scientific analysis of Genie after 1977 has occurred; the only post-1977 updates on Genie and her whereabouts language are based on personal observations, and all are spaced several years apart. , ABC News reported that Genie was living in California, "in psychological confinement as a ward of the state — her sixth foster home. And again, she is speechless."
Genie's case has been compared extensively with that of Victor of Aveyron, an eighteenth-century French child who similarly became a classic case of late language acquisition and delayed development.
Early history.
Genie was the fourth and last child of parents living in Arcadia, California. Her father worked in a factory as a flight mechanic during World War II and got a job in the aviation industry after the war ended; her mother, originally from Oklahoma, had come to southern California as a teenager with family friends fleeing the Dust Bowl. Neither of them had any meaningful education. Her mother's family and friends had strongly opposed their marriage because Genie's father was around twenty years older than her mother. As a child, Genie's father was not very close to his mother, having had limited contact with her while mostly growing up in orphanages. Upon his reaching adulthood she began to spend as much time with him as possible, possibly as compensation for her lack of involvement in his early life, but found him extremely strict and difficult to be around. However, despite their constant arguments about her unsuccessful efforts to convince him to adopt a less rigid lifestyle, according to Genie's mother and brother he remained almost singularly fixated on his mother, always treating his marriage—and subsequently his relationships with his children—as ancillary at best. The couple seemed to be happy and living well to most who knew them, but others thought of Genie's father as something of a distant loner. Her mother began suffering increasingly frequent beatings at his hands, which progressively became more severe. Genie's mother already had vision problems, the result of neurological damage from an early childhood accident. After she married, her eyesight started more rapidly deteriorating due to lingering effects from the pre-existing damage, severe cataracts and a detached retina. Her diminishing vision forced her to become increasingly dependent on her husband.
From the outset of their relationship, Genie's father made it very clear that he neither liked children nor wanted to have any. Still, after about five years of marriage he impregnated his wife. Genie's father continued to beat her throughout her pregnancy, and near the end apparently attempted to beat and strangle her to death. She was in the hospital recovering from this when she went into labor, but gave birth to a daughter who appeared to be healthy. When the girl's crying disturbed her father, he placed her in the garage; as a result, at 10 weeks old she died of pneumonia. Their second child, born a year later, was a boy diagnosed with Rh incompatibility who died at two days of age, allegedly from both complications of Rh incompatibility and choking on his own mucus. Another son was born three years later, once again with Rh incompatibility. The father forced his wife to keep their son quiet as much as possible, and the child was slow to develop and late to walk and to talk. When he was four his paternal grandmother grew concerned about her son's increasing instability and the developmental delays of her grandson, and decided to take over her grandson's care; he made good progress with her for several months before eventually being returned to his parents. Genie was born four years after her brother, and it was around this time that her father began to isolate himself and his family from those around them.
Genie's birth was a standard Caesarean section with no complications. The next day she showed signs of Rh incompatibility and required a blood transfusion, but she was otherwise a healthy weight and size. A medical appointment at three months showed that she was gaining weight normally, but found a congenital hip dislocation which required her to use a highly restrictive Frejka splint from the age of four and half to eleven months. Due to the splint Genie was late to walk, and researchers believed this led Genie's father to start speculating that she was mentally retarded. At subsequent appointments, up until the age of 11 months, records indicate that she was alert and sitting up on her own, but falling behind in weight gain; at birth she had been in the 50th percentile for weight, but at 11 months she was down to the 11th percentile. This led the people who later studied her to believe that she was starting to suffer some degree of malnutrition. After the splint was removed the doctor said Genie would need physical therapy, but her father refused to allow access to any further treatment. Genie's mother later recalled that Genie was not a cuddly baby, did not babble much, and resisted solid food, but at the age of six months she was reportedly in overall good condition and, "taking food well." She further stated that at some point Genie began to say some individual words.
When Genie was 14 months old, she came down with a fever and pneumonitis and was taken to a pediatrician. Upon examining her, the doctor said that although her illness prevented a definitive diagnosis there was a possibility that she was mentally retarded. He also suggested that the brain dysfunction kernicterus might be present; Rh incompatibility is a significant risk factor for kernicterus, and severe cases can lead to serious brain damage. Her father took this opinion to mean that Genie was severely retarded, using it as justification for isolating and abusing her. Six months later, when Genie was 20 months old, her paternal grandmother was killed when a pickup truck ran her over in a hit-and-run traffic accident. Genie's father already had difficulty controlling his anger, and his mother's death deeply affected him; when the truck's driver subsequently received only a probationary sentence for both manslaughter and drunk driving, he became nearly delusional with rage. Upon learning of the court's decision he quit his job and further increased the family's isolation. They moved into the two-bedroom house his mother had been living in, and left her bedroom untouched as a shrine to her. Genie was increasingly confined to the second bedroom, while the rest of the family slept downstairs in the living room.
Confinement.
From the time Genie was born her father had displayed hostility toward her, strongly discouraging his wife and son from paying her any attention. His instability had steadily increased after she was born, and researchers later speculated that his mother's death, and the outcome of the subsequent trial, made him feel as if the outside world had completely failed him. This convinced him that he would need to protect his family from everybody else. He still thought that Genie was severely retarded and would therefore need his additional protection, and believed the best way to provide this for her was to hide her existence entirely.
During the day, Genie was tied to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness which, according to Genie's brother, their father had forced his wife to make. The harness was designed to function like a straitjacket to prevent her from moving her arms or legs, and while in it Genie wore only diapers and could only move her extremities. At night, when her father remembered her, she was bound in a sleeping bag and placed in a crib with a metal-screen cover, her arms and legs immobilized. Genie's mother said that at first she would be allowed to take Genie out to the back yard and put her in a small playpen, but she reportedly angered her father because she frequently took the structure apart; although Genie's mother said she was allowed to stay with her daughter while in the yard, doctors who worked with Genie believed this was a sign that she was often left by herself outside for extended periods of time. After a short period of time, Genie's father decided not to allow her outside her room at all.
Researchers concluded that, if Genie vocalized or made any other noise, her father beat her with a large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a wild dog, sometimes making Genie's brother do this as well, and he grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something he did not like he would make these noises outside the door to intimidate her, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it. The exact reason for his dog-like behavior was never definitively discerned, but at least one scientist who studied Genie speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. This instilled an intense fear of cats and dogs in Genie that persisted long after she was freed. Doctors also gave serious consideration to the possibility of Genie's father subjecting her to sexual abuse, although they never uncovered any definite evidence of it.
Apart from her father's beatings, Genie's only meaningful human interaction occurred during the few minutes when she was being fed. She was not given any solid food; instead, she was fed baby food, cereal, pablum, an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Food was spooned into her mouth as quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough it would be rubbed into her face. Although Genie's mother claimed Genie was fed three times a day, she also said that when hungry Genie would risk a beating by making noise to get attention, leading researchers to believe Genie's father often refused to feed her. Bowing to pressure to keep contact with his sister to a minimum, her brother was often forced to feed her in this manner. Due to the lack of food, Genie was extremely malnourished. The time that she was being fed were normally the only times Genie's father allowed his wife to be with Genie, but she could not feed Genie herself. Later she told psychologists that, when possible, at around 11 PM she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food; this led to Genie developing an unusual sleep pattern, in which she typically woke up for a few minutes around 11 PM, which continued for several months even after she was freed. Once, when Genie was suffering from constipation, her father forced her to drink an entire bottle of castor oil. The ensuing effect on her health was so serious that Genie's father allowed a doctor to examine her, and she ultimately barely survived.
The only sensory stimulation Genie experienced from outside her home came by way of two windows, through which she could hear some traffic noises and see both the side of a neighboring house and a couple inches of sky, and could also occasionally hear birds and airplanes flying over the house. At times she could hear a neighboring child practicing the piano, which researchers thought may have accounted for her later preference for classical piano music. Even these stimuli were extremely limited, as the windows were almost entirely blacked out and the house was well away from the street. In her room, the walls were painted a dirty salmon color with no patterns or designs; the only other patterns or objects in the room were the chair and crib, two plastic rain jackets hanging on the wall which Genie could look at, and cracks in the ceiling paint. On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, TV Guides with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats.
Genie's father had an extremely low tolerance for noise, to the point of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed Genie's mother or brother to speak, and viciously beat them if he heard them talking without permission; any conversations they had were therefore always very quiet and out of Genie's earshot. They were particularly forbidden to speak to or around Genie, preventing her from being exposed to any meaningful amount of language besides her father's occasional swearing. Her father almost never permitted anyone else to leave the house, only allowing his son to go to and from school; to ensure complete isolation, even he had to prove his identity before entering. To discourage disobedience, he frequently sat in the living room with a shotgun in his lap. He did not allow anyone else in the house, and at night would frequently leave the outside lights on to help prevent anyone else from approaching the property; in case someone did come, he always kept his gun nearby.
Genie's mother was almost completely blind by this time, and was essentially passive by nature to begin with. Her husband threatened to kill her if she attempted to contact her parents, close friends who lived nearby, or the police. He also forced Genie's brother into silence, giving him instructions on how to keep his father's actions secret and beating him more often and more severely as he grew older. Genie's brother felt completely powerless to do anything to stop his father, as he knew his mother could not put up any resistance and feared severe retribution for attempting to intervene. No one in the neighborhood knew of the abuse Genie's father inflicted on his family, or was aware that Genie's parents ever had a child besides their son. Convinced that Genie would die by age 12, her father promised that, if she survived past that age, he would allow his wife to seek outside assistance. When Genie turned 12 he reneged on that promise, and Genie's mother took no action for another year and a half.
Rescue.
In late October 1970, Genie's mother and father had a violent argument in which she threatened to leave if she could not call her parents. He eventually relented, and shortly thereafter Genie's mother left her husband to live with her parents in Monterey Park and took Genie with her; Genie's brother, by then 18, had already run away from home to live with friends. A 2002 episode of the television series Body Shock said they got away while Genie's father was buying groceries. Three weeks later, on November 4, Genie's mother brought Genie along while seeking disability benefits in nearby Temple City, California. On account of her near-blindness, she inadvertently entered the general social services office next door. The social worker who greeted them instantly sensed something was not right when she saw Genie; she was shocked to learn Genie's true age was 13, having estimated from her appearance and demeanor that she was around 6 or 7 and possibly autistic. She notified her supervisor, and after questioning Genie's mother and confirming Genie's age they immediately contacted the police. Genie's parents were arrested and Genie became a ward of the court, whereupon a court order was immediately issued for Genie to be taken to Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
Upon Genie's admission David Rigler, a therapist and USC psychology professor who was the chief psychologist at Children's Hospital, and Howard Hansen, then the head of the psychiatry division and an early expert on child abuse, took direct control of Genie's care. The day after Genie's admission physician James Kent, another early advocate for child abuse awareness, examined her. He later stated this examination revealed by far the most severe case of child abuse he would ever encounter, and he came away from it extremely pessimistic about Genie's prognosis. Rigler said the hospital could not procure Genie's developmental history beyond three appointments with a pediatrician, and largely had to rely on the police investigation to piece together Genie's childhood. The officer who arrested Genie's parents questioned them with his partner, and found that Genie's mother would not speak about her family—and particularly not her children—and Genie's father never seemed to acknowledge anything they said to him. In the house the family had been living in police found several devices Genie's father used on Genie and discovered detailed notes Genie's father had written, chronicling both his mistreatment of his family and his efforts to conceal it. Even after the investigation, there were a large number of questions about Genie's childhood left unresolved; writing in mid-1993, Rigler stated that, "There were and there remain deep concerns regarding the exact nature of her abuse."
News of Genie's rescue reached major media outlets on November 17, 1970, receiving a great deal of local and national media attention. That night, Walter Cronkite included a segment on Genie in the CBS Evening News. The "Los Angeles Times" ran two consecutive front-page stories on Genie, and continued to run prominent stories on her and her family for over a week. Although video and photographs of Genie's parents and brother were widely circulated, only one picture of Genie was publicly released; this picture, shown in both the November 17 "Los Angeles Times" article and on the CBS Evening News report, significantly fueled public interest in Genie. Children's Hospital staff said reporters began regularly coming to the hospital hoping to see her, making it very difficult for them to maintain her anonymity as Hansen desired. Acting at least partially on advice from his attorney, despite requests Genie's father refused to speak to the media. Genie's brother also made no public statements, but cooperated with the police investigation and gave detectives important information on his father's abuse.
After the story reached the media, large crowds went to the family's house to try to see Genie's father, which he reportedly found extremely difficult to handle. On November 20, on the morning before a scheduled court appearance on charges of child abuse, Genie's father committed suicide by gunshot; his son was standing with a friend outside the house, with no knowledge of his father's intentions. When police arrived, they found two suicide notes from Genie's father. One, intended for his son, contained instructions for handling his body and a few of his possessions, and the other was directed at the police. One of the notes—police did not specify which—contained the declaration, "The world will never understand."
After the initial police investigation, law enforcement and hospital staff exclusively focused on Genie and her mother. The Children's Hospital staff, especially Kent, wanted to keep Genie's mother involved in Genie's life because she was Genie's only association with her family and her past. Hansen was an acquaintance of attorney John Miner, and asked him to represent her in court; Miner, who knew about the case from the media and had already taken considerable interest in it, readily agreed to defend her. She told the court that beatings at the hands of her husband and her near-total blindness had left her unable to intervene on behalf of her children. Charges against her were subsequently dropped, and over the course of the next several years she received counseling at Children's Hospital; Hansen was her therapist's direct supervisor. The following year, with the consent of Genie's mother and her psychologists, Miner was named Genie's legal guardian.
Characteristics and personality.
Genie was extremely pale and severely undersized and underweight for her age, standing and weighing only , and upon admission had nearly two full sets of teeth in her mouth and a distended abdomen. A series of X-rays taken soon after her admission found she had moderate coxa valga in both hips and an undersized ribcage, and her bone age was determined to be that of an 11 year old. Her gross motor skills were extremely weak; she could not stand up straight nor fully straighten her arms or legs. Kent was somewhat surprised to find her fine motor skills were significantly better, determining they were at approximately the level of a two-year-old; the day after being admitted to the hospital, Kent noticed she did not seem to have any difficulty using only her fingers to flip through pages of a magazine. Genie also exhibited very severe dysphagia, unable to swallow any solid or even soft food and barely able to swallow liquids. Because of this, she would hold any food which she could not swallow in her mouth until her saliva broke it down, and if this took too long she would spit it out and mash it with her fingers.
Despite tests which determined Genie had normal vision in both eyes she could not focus them on anything more than away, which corresponded with the dimensions of the room she was kept in. Her characteristic "bunny walk", in which she held her hands in front of her like claws, suggested an inability to integrate visual and tactile information; when Victor of Aveyron was first found, he had similar difficulties with sensory processing. The restraining harness her father used had caused a thick callus and heavy black bruising on her buttocks, which took several weeks to heal. She was also completely incontinent. Like Victor of Aveyron, she gave no response whatsoever to extreme temperatures; even years later, when she bathed and showered by herself, she invariably used very cold water. Doctors noticed her extreme fear of cats and dogs from the outset, but initially attributed it to an inability to think rationally; its actual origin, that her father had acted like a growling dog to intimidate her, was not discerned until years later.
After moving into Children's Hospital, Genie showed interest in many hospital staff members, often approaching complete strangers and walking with them; Kent said that, even from the very beginning, she made reasonably good eye contact. When eating, she sometimes tried to give her food to the person next to her before grabbing for their food. However, she showed no signs of attachment to anyone in particular, including members of her family; at first, she seemed much more eager to interact with hospital staff. When her mother and brother came to visit her at the hospital for the first time, Kent and Genie were playing with some puppets she had taken a liking to. When they attempted to greet Genie Kent said she walked to her mother and gave her a brief, expressionless look before turning back to Kent and resuming her play, in the process never acknowledging her brother's presence. Kent said she did not seem to distinguish between people, and thought she was more interested in the room itself than the people in it with her. At first, Genie would not allow anyone to touch her, quickly shying away from any physical contact.
Doctors attempting to determine Genie's mental age found it extremely difficult to test her, but on two attempts they found Genie scored at the level of a 13 month old. This put Genie in the mental range of development when most children begin to acquire the first parts of language, which led to some hope that Genie might have some language or be able to learn to speak. Kent noted that while Genie demonstrated some non-verbal ability, she could only communicate a few very basic needs. Even if she was interested in people speaking around her, she had no discernible reaction to it. Doctors immediately noticed that she showed no understanding of any grammar whatsoever, and only responded to about 15–20 words; she knew "mother" and "father", a few color words, and a few other miscellaneous words for objects such as "jewelry box", "door", and "bunny". She also appeared to understand negative commands. Her active vocabulary consisted of just two short phrases, "stop it" and "no more". Her understanding these few words demonstrated that she could distinguish speaking from other sounds and had the ability to hear individual phonemes when listening to speech, two critical components of language acquisition. Kent described the very few early vocal sounds she made as, "a kind of throaty whimper."
At first, hospital staff could not tell whether she had no language or if she was only selectively mute. Tests found that Genie always responded to the very few words she knew as if they were spoken in isolation, and she could not respond to very basic commands. Doctors found no evidence of any metabolic disorders or skull deformations, a neurologist could not find signs of neurological disorders, her chromosomes were normal, and an EEG had no indications of any mental disorder. After testing Genie and checking existing medical records, which also uncovered no clear mental disabilities, researchers determined she had not acquired a language. Kent said that, despite her lack of language, he was immediately certain that she had memories of her past, but she had no way of communicating them to anyone.
Although she almost never vocalized, Genie continually sniffed, blew her nose, salivated, spat and clawed, and appeared very interested in exploring environmental stimuli. When upset she would wildly spit, blow her nose into her clothing, frequently urinate, and scratch and strike herself. These tantrums were the only times Genie was at all demonstrative in her behavior. Even then her face stayed completely expressionless, and she never cried or vocalized. Some accounts said she could not cry at all. If she wanted to make noise, she would push chairs or other similar objects. Her outbursts initially occurred very often and most of the time had no cause which any of the doctors could see, and would continue until she had completely physically tired herself out; at that point Genie would again become silent, and gave off no non-verbal signals. Doctors knew her father's abuse had played some role in her silence during these tantrums, but did not find out until much later the extent to which he had forced her to repress outward expressions. She also had no sense of personal property, frequently pointing to or simply taking something she wanted from someone else. Nonetheless, hospital staff hoped to nurture her closer to normality.
Preliminary assessment.
Soon after Genie was found Jay Shurley, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Oklahoma and a specialist in extreme social isolation, took an interest in her case. In the year and a half after Genie was rescued Shurley came on three three-day visits, and got permission to conduct daily observations of Genie and to carry out a sleep study; the first of these visits was in December 1970, and the others were in approximately six month intervals. From his studies, he hoped to determine whether or not Genie was autistic. He also wanted to determine whether or not she was born mentally retarded, had sustained irreversible brain damage due to her severe malnutrition which left her retarded, or had merely been rendered functionally retarded by her isolation and abuse. Shurley's observations of Genie during the daytime led him to believe she was not autistic, with which later researchers concurred. Although he and doctors at the hospital noted that her behavior indicated a high level of emotional disturbance, she did not exhibit behavioral defense mechanisms characteristic of autism.
For his sleep studies, Shurley found Genie cooperative and had no significant difficulties gathering data. However, he and the hospital staff both observed that she would always wake up at around 11 PM, sit up, and silently remove the electrodes. When Shurley and his assistants put them back on she did not resist, and she always quickly fell back asleep. When analyzing the data from his first test, he noted that Genie's almost total lack of language could potentially have had some influence on his results. He found no signs of brain damage, ruling it out as a cause of her lack of speech. Some aspects of her sleep were typical, such as her production of alpha and theta waves in pre-sleep and Stage One sleep, and others, such as her Stage Three and Four sleep periods, were initially highly irregular but had almost entirely normalized by Shurley's last session. However, although he never found any sudden onset of irregularity in her sleep, he observed a few persistent abnormalities, including a significantly reduced amount (and much larger than average variance in duration) of REM sleep and an atypically high number of sleep spindles. Largely from the latter he concluded she had been retarded from birth, as significantly elevated numbers of sleep spindles are a phenomenon typically found in people born with severe retardation. However, scientists following the case remained divided on this issue. Much later, for example, Susan Curtiss emphatically argued that, though Genie clearly had serious emotional difficulties, she could not have been retarded. Curtiss pointed out that for every calendar year after her rescue, Genie had made a year's developmental progress, which would not be expected if her condition was congenital.
Shurley also noted that Genie's was the most severe case of isolation he had ever studied or heard about—which he maintained more than 20 years later—and offered several suggestions about how to work with her. When he first met Genie he was insistent that her transition to the outside world be very gradual. David Rigler said that, despite their later disagreements, Shurley's recommendations were the only useful advice he ever received on handling Genie and he attempted to follow them as much as possible. Shurley thought Genie would make an excellent case study on many fronts, and in the early part of his involvement he assisted with the research. Over subsequent years, from his home in Oklahoma City Shurley remained in contact with many of the people around Genie, and periodically traveled back to California to visit with Genie, her mother, and the other scientists.
Hospital stay.
After Genie's rescue, the doctors at Children's Hospital began teaching her to speak and socialize. The day after her admission, James Kent was assigned to be Genie's therapist; he thought a steady presence in Genie's life would help her learn to form relationships, so he accompanied her on walks and to all of her appointments. When Kent first met with her he tried to discern her emotional and intellectual state, and at first observed no reactions from her, but when he took several objects out of a bag he found that she seemed afraid of a small puppet. When she threw it on the floor Kent looked at Genie, pretending to be very concerned, and said, "We have to get him back", and was startled when she repeated the word "back" and nervously laughed. As they played she repeated "back" several times, and when Kent said, "The puppet will fall" she repeated "fall". Playing with this and similar puppets quickly became her favorite activity, and during the early part of her stay was, apart from her tantrums, one of the few times she expressed any emotions.
Within a few days of arriving at Children's Hospital Genie started learning to dress herself and began voluntarily using the toilet, although incontinence remained an ongoing problem for her even years later, tending to resurface when she felt under duress. She also gradually became more responsive to other people talking, although doctors were unsure whether she was responding more to verbal or non-verbal stimuli. After two weeks, Kent decided to take Genie to play in the yard outside the hospital's rehabilitation center, hoping to give her a sense of freedom. She quickly began growing and putting on weight, and although her walk remained very distinctive she steadily became more confident in her movements. After four weeks, she had good hand–eye coordination and her ability to focus on objects with her eyes had noticeably improved. In December Kent decided to move her to the hospital's rehabiliation center, as many more activities and opportunities to socialize were accessible there. Around this time, Kent and the other hospital staff assigned to Genie began to see her as a potential case study, and David Rigler obtained a small grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to do preliminary studies on her.
Genie quickly developed a sense of possession, hoarding objects to which she took a liking. Colorful plastic objects quickly became her favorite things to collect and play with, which doctor speculated was due to the items her father had let her use as a child; she did not seem to care whether they were toys or ordinary containers, although she especially sought out beach pails. Later during her stay, when Kent started taking her on trips outside the hospital, Genie's favorite places were stores with plastic toys. When she wanted to go shopping while they were out, she would point to buildings and ask, "Store?" If someone in a toy store looked interesting to her or was holding something she liked, she would walk right up to and attach herself to who or what had caught her attention. By April, almost six months into her stay at Children's Hospital, Genie began to exhibit a sense of possession over items that she thought were hers but did not otherwise care about; Kent recalled one incident where Genie got angry at another girl because she was wearing a hospital dress Genie had worn, even though Genie had never, to that point, showed that she cared at all about clothing.
All of the doctors noticed how intensely she explored her surroundings, although she still seemed more intrigued by objects than other children. One of the hospital staff who spoke to Jay Shurley noted that, although Genie had been apathetic and, "ghost-like" upon admission, she quickly began seeking new sensory stimulation. Approximately a month and a half after her admission, doctors administered a Gesell Developmental Evaluation and found her to be at the level of a 1–3 year old. Doctors saw she enjoyed intentionally dropping or destroying small objects, and instead of discouraging her most of the hospital staff, especially Kent, tried using this to get her to outwardly express her anger. She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her; Susan Curtiss said she acted like she was either in a trance or hallucinating when she heard something she enjoyed. If the song being played was anything other than classical music, she would walk up and change the sheet music to a book which she knew had pieces she liked. Genie quickly developed remarkable nonverbal communication skills and soon learned to imitate people, make consistent eye contact, vocalize, and use gestures to express herself.
Within two months of her rescue, Genie's demeanor and responsiveness to others had considerably changed. The scientists were concerned that she almost never interacted with other children—one psychiatrist wrote in May 1971 that she acted as if other children were, "no different from the walls and furniture in the room"—but after a month she started becoming sociable with familiar adults, first with Kent and soon with other familiar hospital staff. She would sometimes work very hard to get people to stay with her, and expressed disappointment if she did not succeed in her efforts. Not long afterwards she began showing happiness when familiar people came to visit, and Kent noticed her greetings were far more energetic than her relatively mild unhappiness when people left. She got along with both men and women, but they noticed she was afraid of men who wore khaki pants and showed a particular affinity for men with beards; they attributed the latter to her father having been clean-shaven.
Although Genie still made very few attempts to mimic speech, hospital staff saw these efforts as a significant gain. They also saw that she showed a great deal of intrigue when people around her spoke, and intently watched peoples' mouths. When Genie did talk, her speech was difficult to understand. Her voice was very soft and completely monotonic. It was also extremely high-pitched, far above even the normal range of children who are first learning to speak—a trait which scientists had observed in earlier cases of feral children—and at first it was so high that it did not register on the instruments researchers attempted to use to acoustically analyze her speech. As Genie had been forced to repress all vocalization from a very early age, doctors ascribed her abnormal voice quality to severe atrophy of the muscles used to produce speech.
Genie gradually began to express more of her emotions outwards, and her nonverbal communication skills quickly became exceptional; everyone who met her said she had an indescribable way of capturing and eliciting emotions, and she seemed able to communicate her desires to people without talking. When Curtiss and Kent went to toy stores with Genie, they frequently observed that complete strangers would buy something for her because they sensed she wanted it, and both of them were amazed that these gifts were always the types of objects Genie most enjoyed. They especially remembered one man in a butcher shop who connected with Genie without saying anything to her, and whenever they visited he would give her a small piece of meat. When the man stopped working there, the people with Genie were disappointed and saw that Genie expressed similar feelings.
Genie's vocabulary steadily increased, and by four months into her stay at the hospital had expanded to over 100 words. In addition to her vocabulary Genie had also learned a few ritual words to request things and for different functions, such as "Getit" and "Turnon" (both of which she treated as a single word), although she usually needed encouragement to use them. After another month she began spontaneously producing one-word answers, and learned to spontaneously say the word "open". Soon after she produced her first one-word utterances, she appeared to understand some give-and-take of conversation and could spontaneously provide one-word responses to people. Later during her stay she also used language, as well as other behavior, to get people to do things for her. The words she used indicated a fairly advanced ability to mentally categorize objects and situations, showing that she had undergone some mental development during her childhood. Her acquisition to this point was far more rapid than what the hospital's doctors had anticipated, heightening their expectations of her potential for learning language.
After charges were dropped against Genie's mother, she began visiting the hospital twice a week. As Genie got better at forming relationships with the hospital staff she grew more comfortable with her mother, and her mother also grew better at interacting with Genie and responding to situations with her as they arose. After a few months, doctors saw Genie begin to exude happiness when she knew her mother was coming. Although Genie never displayed any emotion when separated from her mother or as her mother left, Kent observed that as her mother kept visiting Genie would have a tantrum after her second visit in the week and never after the first. At first they thought Genie may have been angry at her mother because she served as a reminder of her past, but in a 1972 paper Kent said they had begun to consider the possibility that Genie harbored feelings of abandonment because she knew that her mother was leaving and would not see her again until the following week. At around the same time she started engaging in physical play with adults, eventually beginning to enjoy giving and receiving hugs.
Genie continued to exhibit frustration and have tantrums, but the causes became more obvious; whereas early on doctors could not discern anything which set her off, her later outbursts were in response to situations which would have stirred up similar emotions in most young children. Kent recalled her being very disappointed when she could not go on outings due to a doctor's appointment, and unlike past times where doctors quickly cheered her up by giving her one of her favorite objects she continued to sulk the whole morning. In April 1971 she began to direct some of her anger outwards, but she did not entirely stop harming herself. By April and May 1971, her scores on the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had dramatically increased. Overall her mental age was at the level of a typical 4 year 9 month old, but on individual components she showed a very high level of scatter. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some cooks she had befriended; this was the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so profusely verbal. However, she still had a hard time with large crowds, even after months at the hospital; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside to calm down.
Brain testing.
Beginning in 1971, scientists conducted a series of neurolinguistic tests on Genie. In early March 1971, neuroscientists Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima came from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to administer their own series of brain exams, making Genie the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed study of her brain. Doctors already suspected Genie was extremely right-hemisphere dominant, but the tests went even further and showed asymmetry at a level which had previously only been documented in patients with either split-brain or who had undergone a hemispherectomy. Multiple tests confirmed Genie was right-handed and her brain was completely physically intact, but her left hemisphere appeared to have undergone no specialization whatsoever.
In approximately 95% of right-handed people the left ear, which is more strongly connected to the right hemisphere, better processes environmental and musical sounds, while the right ear is better at picking up language. This preference is usually very subtle, and differences between ears is usually very slight. Genie underwent audiometry tests which confirmed that she had regular hearing in both ears, but on dichotic listening tests researchers found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level with her right ear. When given monaural tests she answered with 100% accuracy in both ears, which was normal. On non-language dichotic listening tests she showed a preference for her left ear, and although it was somewhat larger than usual was not highly abnormal. Her left-ear preference was typical of a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility of her brain's hemispheres only being reversed in dominance. Based on the results of these tests, Bellugi and Klima believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and the imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres was because Genie's sensory input as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. These functions are predominantly controlled in the right hemisphere, which led the scientists to believe that because Genie had no linguistic input to stimulate lateralization in the left hemisphere, her language functions never lateralized to her left hemisphere. Since Genie was able to distinguish speech sounds with her right hemisphere, they thought that Genie's language had lateralized there instead. 
During their testing, Bellugi and Klima also noted that Genie seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but since she was so responsive to non-verbal stimuli they could not tell what she used to respond to other peoples' speech. They recommended using tests and games to establish her comprehension, as these would more accurately pinpoint her linguistic abilities than would observations of her language in everyday interactions, and emphasized that non-language cues such as tone of voice and facial expressions had to be eliminated to get the best results. The scientists who went on to examine Genie's language acquisition designed their tests with their advice in mind.
Interest as a case study.
At the time Genie was discovered, hypotheses proposed by Noam Chomsky and Eric Lenneberg about the innateness and acquisition of language were being widely discussed in both lay and academic circles, but there had been no way to test their hypotheses. In the 1950s Chomsky had argued that language was what separated humans from all other animals, and that the ability to learn language was innate to humans. In 1964, Lenneberg proposed that humans have a critical period for language acquisition, defining the end of this period as the onset of puberty. After this time, if a person had not acquired language, they would be incapable of doing so. Though ancient and medieval texts made several references to language deprivation experiments, modern researchers labeled such ideas "The Forbidden Experiment", impossible to carry out for ethical reasons. Coincidentally, the François Truffaut film "The Wild Child" also premiered in the United States only a week after Genie's rescue. The movie, chronicling the life of Victor of Aveyron and the efforts of deaf-mute instructor and then-aspiring medical student Jean Marc Gaspard Itard to teach him language and integrate him into society, heightened public interest in cases of children subjected to extreme abuse or isolation.
Prompted by this coincidence of timing, a team of Children's Hospital scientists led by David Rigler sought and obtained a grant from the NIMH to study Genie in May 1971. At Butler's suggestion, they screened "The Wild Child" during their first meeting as an inspiration for ideas; the scientists later said this had a profound impact because they immediately saw the parallels with Genie. The primary focus of their research was to test Lenneberg's theory that humans have a critical period for language acquisition, and UCLA linguistics professor Victoria Fromkin would head the linguistic evaluation. The research team also planned to continue periodic evaluations of Genie's psychological development in various aspects of her life. From the time Genie had been admitted to Children's Hospital researchers had tried to keep her identity concealed, and it was around the time of the grant proposal that they adopted the pseudonym Genie for her. The name referenced parallels researchers saw between Genie's sudden emergence into society from captivity past childhood and a genie's sudden emergence from a bottle without having a human childhood.
At around the same time, Susan Curtiss began her work on Genie's case as a graduate student in linguistics under Victoria Fromkin; over the coming years, Curtiss would be one of the most influential figures in Genie's life. Curtiss already knew of Genie from news reports, and used the hospital's video and transcripts to piece together her progress before they met. Together with Fromkin, she tested Genie and tracked her language acquisition, writing numerous papers covering various aspects of Genie's progress. When Curtiss first met Genie she found Genie's behavior bizarre and outright disgusting, and wrote that she looked extremely unkempt and smelled terrible. Despite all of this, Curtiss wrote that she somehow still looked very pretty and remembered being immediately drawn to Genie. Within the first month of meeting Genie, Curtiss quickly recognized her powerful non-verbal communication abilities. When she started to gauge Genie's language abilities, she saw that Genie had clearly learned some principles of language and felt she started her work later in the process than she and Fromkin would have liked. When Curtiss first met Genie she realized her language was not yet at a usefully testable level, so she devoted the summer to simply getting to know Genie and gaining her friendship. For the remaining month that Genie was at Children's Hospital Curtiss began to go along with Genie and Kent on trips into town, and she and Genie very quickly bonded with each other. During the summer of 1971, while Curtiss was still befriending Genie, she and Fromkin realized existing linguistic tests would not yield meaningful results, so they designed a set of 26 new tests from which they extrapolated most of their data. Curtiss also wrote down every spontaneous utterance she heard Genie make, ultimately recording a few thousand by the time she completed her dissertation in 1976.
At the same time Susan Curtiss first met Genie, approximately six months after admission, Genie was reevaluated on the Leiter scale and measured on a Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale; these both put her mental age between a 5 and 8 year old. Child psychologist David Elkind, who was involved in the research team's meetings, evaluated Genie and reported she understood object permanence. Elkind also noticed that after Genie heard a dog she later attempted to mimic its barking, the first time she tried to reenact something after it happened; he and the hospital psychologists saw both events as major cognitive gains. Later that month, when Genie was with Jean Butler, Butler asked a boy holding two balloons how many balloons he had; when the boy said "three", Butler said Genie appeared startled and quickly gave him another balloon. This was seen as a significant step, as it demonstrated that she was listening to other people, she understood significantly more language than she produced, and that she could count to at least some degree.
In mid-June 1971, when Susan Curtiss started going on trips with Kent and Genie, she noticed Genie often approached the front doors of random houses; Curtiss said Genie seemed to hope someone would see her and invite her in. David Elkind took her on a walk through Griffith Park and said she was fascinated by everything around her, and like Curtiss and Kent noted how intently she explored her surroundings. Her physical health continued to improve, and Curtiss remembered that Genie would tire everyone else out on her walks. On these trips outside the hospital, Curtiss would deliberately act silly to help Genie release some of her pent-up tension. Her doctors, at that time, predicted a completely successful rehabilitation.
First foster home.
Genie's teacher at Children's Hospital, Jean Butler, became very close to her; Jay Shurley especially praised Butler's work with Genie. In June 1971, Butler obtained permission to take Genie on day trips to her home in Country Club Park, Los Angeles. After one of these trips near the end of that month, Butler told the hospital that she (Butler) might have contracted rubella, to which Genie would have been exposed. Although the scientists and hospital staff had been looking to place Genie in a foster home for months, they were reluctant to give foster custody to Butler and were very skeptical of Butler's story, strongly suspecting she had concocted it as part of a bid to take over as Genie's primary caretaker. Nonetheless, Genie was temporarily quarantined in Butler's home as an alternative to placing her in isolation at the hospital. Butler, who was unmarried and living alone at the time and childless, subsequently petitioned for foster custody of Genie, and despite the hospital's objections the stay was extended while authorities considered the matter.
Butler's observations.
During Genie's stay in her home, Butler continued observing, writing about, and filming Genie. Butler's journal and films are the only data available on Genie's speech and the primary source of information on her behavior during this time, as Curtiss' dissertation contains almost nothing from this period. One behavior she documented was Genie's hoarding, first observed at Children's Hospital; in particular, Genie collected and kept dozens of containers of liquid in her room. The scientists did not know what caused this, although it is a common trait of children from abusive homes. On several occasions Butler went to the beach with Genie, who seemed fascinated with the water and waded in up to her ankles. Butler worked on Genie's ongoing incontinence problems, which gradually eased and almost entirely went away by the end of her stay. Although Butler could not discern the reason for Genie's intense fear of cats and dogs, after witnessing it firsthand Butler tried to help Genie overcome it by watching episodes of the television series "Lassie" with her and giving her a battery-powered toy dog. Butler wrote that Genie could eventually tolerate fenced dogs, though there was no progress with cats.
Butler, the scientists, and the NIMH evaluating committee all noted a marked improvement in Genie's demeanor during her stay with Butler, agreeing that she seemed more relaxed. In addition, Butler claimed that she had made significant progress with Genie's behavior; she wrote that she had gotten Genie to stop attacking herself when angry, instead getting her to express anger through words or by hitting objects. She also said that Genie had become noticeable more talkative, and that her vocabulary and grammar had undergone substantial growth. Both she and the scientists also noticed that soon after moving in Genie started showing the first signs of reaching puberty. This both marked a dramatic improvement in her overall health and definitively put her past Lenneberg's proposed critical period for language acquisition. David Rigler, however, noted that the onset of menstruation complicated efforts to deal with her incontinence.
Dispute.
While Genie was living with her, Butler allowed Genie's mother, who had regained much of her eyesight through corrective cataract surgery her therapists arranged for her, to come on weekly visits. After her surgery Genie's mother reportedly changed her opinions of John Miner, her therapists, and several of the scientists. When she saw Genie for the first time she was shocked and concerned at how thin Genie was. However, Butler began to strenuously resist visits by the scientists, whom she felt overtaxed Genie and to whom she began disparagingly referring in her journal as the "Genie Team", a name which stuck. Butler particularly seemed to dislike James Kent and Susan Curtiss, writing that Kent was too permissive towards Genie's behavior and Curtiss was not experienced enough in working with children and overzealous in her efforts to elicit speech from Genie; during the latter part of Genie's stay at Butler's house, Butler prevented both of them from visiting. She frequently argued with the scientists about Genie's handling, especially with Rigler, although he maintained that these disputes were never as heated or personalized as Butler portrayed them.
The scientists strongly contested Butler's claims of pushing Genie too hard, contending that she enjoyed the tests and was allowed to take breaks at will. They viewed Butler as personally troubled, noting her longstanding and widely known reputation for combativeness among coworkers and superiors. Several of the scientists, especially Curtiss and Howard Hansen, recalled Butler openly stating that she hoped Genie would make her famous; Curtiss remembered Butler repeatedly proclaiming her intent to be, "the next Anne Sullivan". She also demanded several times to be credited in the scientists' research publications; although Rigler initially acquiesced on this, the scientists eventually decided against it. During Genie's stay Butler had the man she was dating—who was himself a former professor at the University of Southern California and a well-known, respected psychologist—move in with her, as she believed authorities would view her pending foster application more favorably if she offered a two-parent home. Butler wrote he and Genie got along very well, which Shurley later corroborated, and he sometimes attempted to mediate disputes between Butler and the scientists. According to Shurley, he was also very intent on gaining foster custody of Genie. Despite Butler receiving positive evaluations from both the agency's case handler and the NIMH's evaluating committee, the case handler's superiors were very divided over the adequacy of Butler's home.
In mid-August, California authorities informed Butler they had rejected her application for foster custody. The extent, if any, to which Children's Hospital influenced the decision is unclear. Rigler maintained several times that despite the scientists' objections to Butler's application, neither the hospital nor any of its staff had intervened, and he said the decision surprised him. In early August he had written a letter to Butler—copies of which he sent to Kent, Howard Hansen, and the agency's case handler—in which he said that despite his frustration due to her lack of cooperation with the scientists, he thought her home was suitable and her application would likely be accepted. The "Nova" documentary on Genie, however, states the rejection of Butler came partially on the hospital's recommendation; there is evidence many hospital authorities felt Butler's ability to care for Genie was inadequate, and hospital policy forbade its staff members from becoming foster parents of its patients. Butler herself believed the hospital had opposed her application so Genie could be moved somewhere more conducive to research, and wrote that Genie, upon being told of the decision, was extremely upset and had said, "No, no, no." She did not see Genie again for several years, though she stayed in contact with Genie's mother. Over the next 15 years, she made repeated attacks on the scientists working with Genie in numerous forums.
Second foster home.
After Genie was removed from Jean Butler's house, she was returned to Children's Hospital; on the same day, she was transferred to David Rigler's home in Los Feliz. From the outset the scientists had agreed they wanted Genie to have a home to live in, and while Genie was with Butler they had been unable to find anyone else; after denying Butler custody, there was unanimous consensus among the doctors and scientists that Genie needed to live somewhere more stable than a hospital setting and someplace where she could form relationships with specific people. In early August Hansen had suggested to Rigler that he take custody of Genie if authorities rejected Butler, and although he initially balked at the idea decided to talk it over with his wife, Marilyn; Marilyn had graduate training as a social worker and had just completed a graduate degree in human development, and had previously worked in both nursery schools and Head Start Programs. They had three adolescent children of their own, and ultimately decided that, if no one else would, they would be willing to temporarily care for Genie until a new foster home became available. Jay Shurley said the Riglers also thought their experience with raising three children would give them an advantage over Butler. All of the scientists knew how unusual it was to make David Rigler a foster parent while still one of Genie's therapists and the head of the scientific team, but they thought the Riglers' home offered the type of environment they wanted for her.
Despite the hospital's policy, they, John Miner, and the state consented and the Riglers were made temporary foster parents. Although they initially intended the arrangement to last for three months at most, Genie ultimately stayed there for four years. While living with them Marilyn became Genie's new teacher and Susan Curtiss was allowed to visit almost every day, both to conduct her tests and to go on outings with Genie. In addition to being a foster parent David Rigler also decided to become Genie's primary therapist, taking over this role from James Kent. Shortly after Genie moved in, one of the Riglers' children went away to college, enabling Genie to have her own room and bathroom in the house. Much of Genie's development during this time was either tracked in notes or captured on film, and David Rigler said she eventually learned how to operate the cameras herself.
Behavioral progress.
Upon moving in with the Riglers Genie's incontinence issues resurfaced, and Marilyn noticed her speech was much more halting and hesitant than Butler had described. Genie very rarely spoke at all, and when she did it was almost always in one-word utterances. In addition, unless she saw a dog or something else which frightened her, both her speech and behavior exhibited a great deal of latency; most of the time, her responses were several minutes delayed. The Riglers also found Genie frequently took things which belonged to their children and could be very destructive, requiring full-time supervision. She was captivated by books and magazines, especially National Geographic issues—of which the Riglers had a very large collection—and David Rigler especially found it disconcerting that she did not hesitate to tear out a page or a picture she liked.
As Genie settled into living with the Riglers, her incontinence mostly disappeared and her demeanor improved. Although Genie was very lazy in both Curtiss' and the Riglers' estimation, which sometimes masked the extent of her progress, she quickly made many noticeable gains. She eventually grew comfortable with the Riglers' cat and dog, and could eventually walk the dog and feed it by herself, but remained extremely afraid of unfamiliar cats and dogs. Although she never developed fully normal social skills, she became somewhat more sociable in her interactions with both her foster family and other people. Her responses to most stimuli became more rapid, but even by the end of her stay she sometimes took a few minutes before acknowledging something or someone. She also became somewhat more responsive to what other people said, regardless of whether it was a question, statement, or an attempt to call her, although she still frequently did not show any obvious signs that she had heard the other person. Gradually, she began to outwardly exhibit more of her emotions, both positive and negative; Curtiss said one major breakthrough she observed was when, upon going to the Riglers' house to meet with Genie one morning, she found Genie in tears because she was feeling sick and had just found out she would need to see a doctor. Over the course of several more months, her behavior improved to the point that she started going to first a nursery school and then a public school for mentally retarded children. David Rigler wrote that eventually she rode the school bus with other people her age, and attended social functions at her school.
In February 1973 Genie gave Curtiss some rings she had gotten, which was the first time Genie ever gave or shared something with Curtiss. Around the same time, David Rigler and Curtiss both remembered Genie developing a crush on her bus driver, which the scientists saw as a sign that she was maturing. In late 1973 she began to show some degree of sensitivity to temperature, although it was still much less than normal. By May 1975 she began to try to start games with other people, and at least once she started a role-playing game with Curtiss in which she had to speak. Genie also learned how to do some simple chores around the house, such as ironing and operating a sewing machine, and by the end of her stay could make simple meals for herself.
Continued brain exams.
The findings of Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima had raised a large number of questions about how Genie's brain would process and acquire language. Some right-hemisphere language acquisition had previously been observed in split-brain and hemispherectomy patients, and the scientists monitored her acquisition compared to them. They also wanted to observe her brain's development as she was exposed to more verbal and non-verbal stimuli, as they wanted to see whether Genie would remain so extremely right-hemisphere dominant and, if she did, determine what parts of her brain she was using during language acquisition. In the fall of 1971 they began a series of brain exams conducted at the Brain Research Institute at UCLA.
These exams, done under the direction of Curtiss, Victoria Fromkin, and Stephen Krashen—who was then also one of Fromkin's graduate students—largely confirmed Bellugi and Klima's original findings. They continued both the verbal and nonverbal dichotic listening tests, which were administered throughout 1972 and 1973, and found Genie remained extremely left-ear dominant for language sounds. The hypothesis put forth by psychologist Doreen Kimura to explain dichotic listening results stated that their underlying cause was that the contralateral pathways overrode ipsilateral pathways, and that split-brain and hemispherectomy patients were so asymmetrical because the non-language hemisphere could not interfere with these pathways. As the scientists could not find evidence of physiological problems with her left hemisphere which could have caused its disuse to such an extreme degree, their explanation for the underlying cause of Genie's extreme left-ear language preference was that abnormal neurological activity in her left hemisphere—which they speculated was due to her atrophied language center—was blocking all language reception in her right ear. Because she could distinguish non-language sounds with some degree of accuracy in the ear which would normally be non-dominant for them, they thought that it was only language sounds which her left hemisphere obstructed. The fact that Genie's left hemisphere had not lateralized while her right hemisphere had also supported a hypothesis, put forth in 1972, that the right hemisphere lateralized first because its functions are more directly involved with picking up on environmental stimuli.
In addition to continuing the dichotic listening tests, Curtiss, Fromkin, and Krashen also gave Genie tachistoscopic and evoked response tests. The evoked response tests were administered during 1974 and 1975 and consisted of a language test and a face recognition test. The first time Genie took a tachistoscopic test the scientists used an exam involving chimeric figures previously tried on split-brain patients, which Curtiss wrote had the possibility to give them especially valuable information; as Genie peregrinated to an enormous degree when answering, their results were inconclusive and therefore effectively useless. With the other tachistocsopic tests there were some difficulties with their administration, as they require the subject to focus on one point for an extended period of time and the people testing Genie could not always be sure she was looking in the right place. Curtiss also thought that the design of some of the tachistoscopic tests was less than ideal, and made some of their findings inconclusive. Nonetheless, they were able to gain considerable insight into Genie's neurological functions.
The scientists' tests showed a higher right-hemisphere level of involvement in all of the non-language cortical tasks on which they tested Genie, and found she performed most functions primarily using her right hemisphere, such as perspective, recalling unrelated objects, gestalt perception, and number perception, at a much higher level than those typically performed by the left hemisphere, such as sequential order tests. For instance, in May 1975 the scientists administered a Mooney Face Test, considered the best gestalt perception test. This test contains a set of 50 real and 20 false faces in black and white, and the subject has to determine which ones are real and false. Genie got all of the real faces and only missed 6 false ones, the highest in medical literature at that time. Her ability to piece together objects from solely tactile information, another right hemisphere task, was also extremely good. On one test, the tester showed Genie three different sized circles before hiding them from view, and Genie was then given different arcs and asked to determine which circle they fit into; the arcs were never shown, but Genie could feel both the arc and the circles at any time during the test. She got 38 out of 45 correct on this test, which was reportedly extremely high, and of the mistakes 6 were on the most difficult components and one was on the second most difficult. Similarly, in 1977 her capacity for stereognosis was at approximately the level of a typical 10 year old. By contrast, Genie had a great deal of difficulty with learning basic tasks such as tying her shoes because they require performing a series of actions in a particular order.
Genie's improvement on right hemisphere functions was also extraordinarily rapid, and far outstripped her ability to learn left hemisphere tasks; for instance, in January 1972, about a year and three months after being rescued, her scores on Raven's Progressive Matrices were in the 50th percentile for an 8.5–9 year old. Some abilities, such as her spatial awareness, were at or higher than the level of typical adults, indicating that her brain had lateralized and that her right hemisphere underwent specialization; on spatial awareness tests, her scores were reportedly the highest ever recorded to that point. Conversely, when the scientists administered Knox Cubes tests in 1973 and 1975 Genie improved from the level of a 6 year old to a 7 1/2 year old. Although this was more rapid than her progress with language, it was significantly slower than her advances with right hemisphere tasks.
There were a few primarily right hemisphere tasks Genie did not perform well on; she had difficulty with certain facial recognition tests and certain tests on remembering designs. In October 1975 Genie scored at a "borderline" level on the latter, although she did not make the mistakes typical of brain-damaged patients. In addition, on a Benton Visual Retention Test and an associated facial recognition test Genie's scores were well below average; they were far lower than any average scores for people without brain damage, at the very low end of average for people with lesions on their left hemispheres, and in the low average range for people with lesions on their right hemispheres. Although this sharply contrasted with Genie's facial recognition in everyday situations, in which both Curtiss and others said Genie immediately recognized and put a name to faces she had not seen in years, researchers wrote that they had anticipated this result on this test. Curtiss' explanation was that, because previous results from these tests showed that people with any abnormal brain function in either the left or the right hemisphere had difficulty, they normally require use of both hemispheres; since Genie exclusively used her right hemisphere, these would therefore be very difficult for her.
When the scientists administered tests specifically geared at determining where she was processing language, they found more evidence that Genie was processing language in her right hemisphere. When they administered an evoked response test and monitored her responses with an EEG, they picked up more activity from the two electrodes over the right hemisphere of her brain than they did from the electrodes placed over the normal locations of the Broca's area and Wernicke's area in the left hemisphere. On another tachistoscopic test, Genie was required to point to words which rhyme and had no difficulty doing so. Her performance was equally good when scientists gave her an evoked response test using familiar homophones and asked her to give the correct meaning from the sentence, for instance the sentences "I sock Bobo" and "The sock is red". This demonstrated that her receptive language comprehension was significantly better than her expressive comprehension, which was similar to the results of split-brain and hemispherectomy patients. Taken with Genie's results on the dichotic listening tests, Genie's tachitoscopic and evoked response tests lent further support to the researchers' belief that Genie was using her right hemisphere for language, as they found a high level of involvement from her right anterior cerebral cortex in these tests. The lack of improvement on both left hemisphere tasks and right-ear language identification bolstered their conclusions.
Relationship with her mother.
While Genie was living with the Riglers, her mother continued visiting her, usually meeting once a week at a park or restaurant. Gradually, the bond between her and Genie grew stronger, and David Rigler said they encouraged Genie to go on increasingly frequent overnight visits to her mother's house. Genie's mother also took Genie with her on visits to her parents' house. However, though the Riglers wanted to keep Genie's mother involved with Genie and never expressed any antipathy towards her, while Genie was living with them her mother only visited their house three times. Besides the problems Genie's mother faced with transportation, as she could not drive, years later Marilyn also said she was uncomfortable with acting as a mother to Genie in her house in front of Genie's real mother, and thought a more neutral location would help diminish the awkwardness for both of them.
Many other scientists on the research team did not welcome the presence of Genie's mother, citing a strong dislike for her passivity during Genie's early life. Genie's mother got along considerably better with Jay Shurley, who came from a Texas ranch family similar to hers during her childhood before she moved to California; he thought the other scientists did not treat her as an equal, though he acknowledged the amount of help many of the hospital staff—especially Kent and Howard Hansen—had given her. Genie's mother was also beginning to experience significant financial difficulties, and Shurley also said she was acutely aware of and felt very self-conscious due to the wide class difference between herself and the researchers.
The scientists, in turn, speculated Genie's mother gave them a mostly cool reception because they were a reminder of her inaction during Genie's childhood. They further thought she was in denial over both Genie's condition and the hand that she had in causing it. David Rigler distinctly remembered one day when Genie's mother saw Genie walking shortly after her eye surgery, and after a little while he said she abruptly asked him, "What have you done to her that she walks this way?" Rigler said he regarded both as positive steps for Genie's mother, as it meant the therapy she was receiving was helping her come to terms with what had happened to her and her children, but denied that he or his wife ever viewed her as inferior. Curtiss said that Genie's mother often gave conflicting statements to her therapists about her family life before and during Genie's captivity, which made it difficult for the scientists to be certain about what she told them; as a result, they only relied on her statements when there was no other potential source of information or when other evidence corroborated what she said.
Jean Butler—who had married shortly after Genie was removed from her house and was now using her married name, Ruch—also got along very well with Genie's mother. In addition to persistent attempts to convince the NIMH's evaluating committee that the scientists were refusing to give Genie's mother necessary financial support and deliberately forcing her out of Genie's life, she began to exert more influence over Genie's mother and gradually convinced her to see the scientists and their work in the most negative light possible. During the latter part of Genie's stay there, her mother increasingly began to feel the scientists were marginalizing her.
Language.
When Genie first moved in with the Riglers, she remained mostly quiet. She did not usually listen to anyone unless she was being directly addressed or Curtiss was playing classical music on the piano. After she settled down in her new surroundings her speech, which although much like her general behavior still frequently exhibited considerable latency, began steadily improving. When Genie first moved in with the Riglers, her voice remained extremely high-pitched and soft. The scientists spent a considerable amount of time working to help strengthen Genie's voice and improve her pronunciation. Over time, her voice gradually lowered in pitch and became somewhat louder, but her voice was still very high-pitched and her pronunciation continued to be soft and breathy. Even as late as June 1975, Curtiss wrote that Genie would occasionally say a word in a creaky voice. In mid-October 1971, Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening to her; after that point, she began paying attention to people even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. Sometimes, she would even spontaneously contribute to an ongoing conversation.
Thorough testing of Genie's linguistic abilities began in October 1971, when Curtiss and Fromkin decided her linguistic abilities would yield results. These tests continued throughout her stay with the Riglers. Largely based on the data from these tests, from 1973 to 1975 Curtiss and Fromkin published several of the earliest papers on Genie; combined, these covered her progress from 1971 to early 1975. Curtiss conducted most of the tests herself, once a week almost every week, and recorded many of her sessions with Genie on film. Afterwards she, Fromkin, and the research team analyzed the data from these sessions. Curtiss was also interested in keeping track of Genie's application of language in real world situations, and continued to observe Genie's progress outside the test settings. When Curtiss was not present, the Riglers and a few others who knew them observed Genie and reported any developments they had witnessed. Between these, the tests conducted on her brain functions, and other evaluations of her social and psychological progress, the scientists speculated she may have been more tested than any other child. The scientists considered her progress with language to be a substantial part of their larger goal of helping her to ingratiate herself into society, so although they wanted to observe what vocabulary and grammar Genie could acquire on her own, out of a sense of obligation they assisted her whenever possible. To supplement Genie's language acquisition, the scientists also worked to teach Genie some ritual speech for use in common everyday situations.
On broader levels Genie's language development followed some normal patterns of young children when they are learning a first language, but researchers noted many marked differences with her language acquisition. The size of Genie's vocabulary and the speed with which she expanded it continued to outstrip all anticipations, and she learned many words which were not typical of children in similar phases of language acquisition. However, she had far more difficulty with acquisition of basic grammar and syntax, resulting in her vocabulary being much more advanced and sophisticated than most people in equivalent phases of learning and using these rules. Although she clearly learned certain principles of grammar, the rate at which she learned these properties of language were far slower than normal. Some constructions, such as auxiliary verbs, she was never able to use or understand. Even if a sentence using these structures conveyed exactly the same semantic meaning as a sentence which only used pieces of grammar she had acquired, she would show full comprehension of the latter but none of the former. In addition, Genie did not speak very often, and with very few exceptions when she did talk it was in very short utterances which often did not lend themselves to easy grammatical analysis. Their efforts to teach Genie met with some success, but in some cases she remained completely unable to memorize what would normally be a simple sentence for someone in her phase of language acquisition. Genie continued to learn new vocabulary, but after a few years the scientists wrote that her progress with grammar and syntax had noticeably slowed down, leading Curtiss to later question how well Genie had really learned these aspects of language.
In many cases, Genie's language development was used to help gauge her overall psychological state. For instance, she began to form imperative sentences using the vocative, as in, "Go way Joel, finish story!", which suggested not only progress in her language comprehension but an increasing level of self-confidence and self-concept. However, this was tempered by the fact that despite her ability to use and comprehend imperatives, she very rarely would. Although she responded if called, she would almost never call someone to her. In addition when she encountered a boy at her school who repeatedly pinched her Curtiss and the Riglers worked on scenarios to tell him to stop; despite learning to do it with them and demonstrating that she knew what words to use, Genie could not bring herself to say it when the real situation arose. Researchers also noted she began using them much later in the language acquisition process than most, as imperatives are usually among the earliest types of sentences young children form. Although the scientists thought this might be due to her emotional problems, they also thought it may have been because using the vocative was predicated on psychological factors. They speculated that it requires the speaker to feel a right to demand something of someone, and a person with insufficient self-concept would not feel able to do this.
In some instances, learning a new aspect of language played a direct role in helping to further her psychological and mental development. Curtiss wrote that at the time Genie learned to use the ritual phrase "May I have " she was also learning how to use money, and she would frequently be paid small amounts in pennies for doing work or chores around the house. The ability to ask for payment using this phrase helped fuel her desire to make money, and in turn led to her taking a more active role in performing activities which would lead to a reward; at least once, when Marilyn began setting the table—an activity for which Genie was often paid—Genie stood up from Curtiss playing the piano and actively interrupted Marilyn so she could be rewarded. Curtiss also noted Genie gradually beginning using language to describe fictional events, attempting on at least two occasions in the last two years of her stay with the Riglers to lie to Marilyn and to Curtiss. Soon after the first lie she told, in early 1974, she began to describe some of her fantasies to the scientists in language; Curtiss remembered a conversation Genie had with Marilyn in which Genie expressed a desire to be with her bus driver, during which Genie described what she wanted to do with him. The scientists considered these to be substantial gains, both for her language and cognitive development.
In addition to testing Genie's knowledge of language, the scientists also observed her use of it in daily interactions. Despite her desire to socialize, Genie never learned to use automatic speech. Genie could start and continue a conversation on a topic, but even after her vocabulary had expanded she continued to rely on repeating words or short phrases to maintain the discussion. Most conversations with Genie consisted either of someone asking her a question several times until she responded or her saying something to which the other person responded. Typically she did not acknowledge statements, requests, or other common pieces of conversation, and she would not show whether she had heard or understood what someone said to her. Unless she was actively attempting to control the conversation, she relied on the other person to achieve and maintain the flow of the interaction. She was generally more willing to discuss topics which interested her, and was far more likely to respond if people were talking about these topics, although she would sometimes attempt to join in a conversation on other matters. When talking to someone she often did not give important information in her words, especially when telling someone about an event that person had not seen. She also deleted as many words as possible when speaking, even if the person was unfamiliar with her style of speech. What grammar rules and syntax she did know were inconsistently applied, although it was not always clear whether the missing pieces of grammar were intentionally or inadvertently omitted.
Recalling past events.
A few months into Genie's stay with the Riglers, Genie demonstrated the ability to use language to describe events which had occurred in the fairly recent past. Several months later, sometime during early to mid-1972, the Riglers overheard Genie talking to herself. When they listened to her they heard her say, "Father hit big stick. Father is angry." to herself, demonstrating she could even talk about her life before learning language; this gave researchers new insights into her early life and disproved the theory of 18th century philosopher Étienne Bonnot de Condillac that humans require language to form memories. During the rest of her stay with the Riglers, they said she would constantly repeat "Father hit" to herself. Eventually, Genie could provide longer and more detailed memories of her past. The Riglers tried to get her to talk about her childhood as much as possible, and Marilyn would sometimes coach Genie by role-playing as Genie's real mother. Before the Riglers worked with Genie to understand the concept of death she often asked where her father was, afraid that he would come to get her. She gradually began to speak about her father, and could talk about his treatment of her.
"Father hit arm. Big wood. Genie cry...Not spit. Father. Hit face – spit. Father hit big stick. Father is angry. Father hit Genie big stick. Father take piece wood hit. Cry. Father make me cry. Father is dead."
Non-verbal.
Even while speaking, Genie continued to use supplementary nonverbal gestures to improve her intelligibility. With some words, she would pantomime them as she spoke; for instance, the scientists noted she would crouch into a seated position when she said the words "sit" or "sick". Although this is normal to some degree among children learning a first language, she seemed to use them as an integral part of her vocabulary. When Curtiss saw how well Genie could gesture and act out her sentences, to encourage Genie to talk she devised a game to utilize these abilities. She and Genie would make simple sentences together, such as "Genie is silly", and then read them and act them out together; Genie took to this game, and sometimes tried to involve others. As Genie had considerable difficulty with switching between tenses in her speech, which describing past occurrences requires, Curtiss said she would also act out events. When she was not understood right away, she would persist until her message was communicated. Despite efforts to teach Genie to read she did not start to read at all until mid-1975, at which point Genie began learn to read and write at least five to ten simple words. Prior to this time she could remember the definition of a word card for the duration of the session—for instance, if Curtiss showed Genie a card said "red" on it she would use it to represent the word meaning red—but she could not carry this memory into future sessions. By the time Curtiss completed and published her dissertation, she wrote that Genie could read around five to ten names and words and could write individual letters in print.
When Genie was first removed from confinement she would only draw pictures if asked to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings if she could not express herself in words. Her sophisticated sense of perspective rapidly became evident in many of her drawings; by November 1971, she could depict silhouettes and figures in profile, both of which require a relatively high degree of cognitive ability. In addition to her own drawings, Genie would frequently use pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences. She especially collected pictures of things that frightened her; Curtiss recalled one incident when a helmeted diver scared Genie, after which she would not relax until she showed Curtiss a picture she had found of a similar looking diver in a National Geographic issue. Several months into Genie's stay with the Riglers, she found a picture of a wolf in a magazine which sent her into a terror. When the Riglers saw her reaction, they asked Genie's mother if she knew what might have caused it; this was when she told them about how her husband had acted like a dog to intimidate Genie, which was the first time the underlying reason for her fear became apparent to the scientists.
Throughout her stay, the Riglers and Curtiss saw how frequently and effectively Genie used her nonverbal skills. She still seemed to be able to communicate with complete strangers without speaking; David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed a father and a young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other, and said the boy suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Although the scientists tried to get her to talk as much as possible, they knew that historians and scientists studying Jean Marc Gaspard Itard's work with Victor of Aveyron thought one of the major flaws with his work was his insistence that Victor learn one method of communication—in his case writing—to the exclusion of others. They wanted to take full advantage of her ability to use gestures, so in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn sign language; Curtiss stated that the instruction given to her was, "a system of signing somewhere between American Sign Language and signed English in its grammatical system." Even when learning sign language, Genie continued to use and invent her own gestures in conjunction with the conventional signs she learned. Although the scientists did not test Genie's progress with sign language, Curtiss recorded one of Genie's advances with it in the spring of 1975.
Loss of funding and research interest.
Despite Genie's progress, after three years the National Institute of Mental Health, which had been funding the research, grew concerned about the lack of scientific data being generated and the disorganized state of project records. A huge amount of data was being collected, but apart from Curtiss and Fromkin's linguistics data much of it was of very limited use. The enormous volume of non-linguistics data proved to be a hindrance to research, as there was far more information than could have realistically been used, and it eventually became impossible for researchers to determine the importance of much of this information. The scientific team was also storing its information in suboptimal condition, filed in random drawers and boxes with no categorization system. In 1973, Rigler asked for and received a one year extension on the grant, but the NIMH said it wanted more hard data and coherent organization of the researchers' work. Rigler said he and the other scientists tried to comply, but found the case was not conducive to producing quantitative statistics. He argued the NIMH did not understand the nature of Genie's case, saying much of it necessarily relied on unquantifiable observations, and pointed out that in the most congruous case, that of Victor of Aveyron, the scientists reported similar difficulties.
When the year-long extension neared its end and the scientists were preparing to request another extension Jean Butler Ruch, who had continually attacked the scientists since her application to become Genie's foster parent was rejected, began vociferously arguing against it. She obtained David Rigler's proposal for an additional three-year extension—which, due to a processing mistake, she managed to do before Rigler presented it to the NIMH—and began lobbying for its rejection, disputing the progress Genie had made with Curtiss and the Riglers. When the NIMH's grants committee met to consider Rigler's proposal they concluded that, although the research was considerably and demonstrably beneficial to Genie and would not cause her active harm, there had been minimal overall progress and, "the research goals projected probably will not be realized". In a unanimous decision from the committee, funding for the study was cut off. Despite the NIMH grant ending, Curtiss continued to spend time with Genie, and in 1977 she and Fromkin obtained year-long grants from the National Science Foundation to continue their work.
Now 18, Genie had made noticeable gains in many aspects of her psychological development. David Rigler wrote in June 1975 that Genie continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing. However, Curtiss wrote of Genie that at that time that much of her behavior remained unsocialized. Genie still spoke only in phrases such as "Ball belong hospital." Her progress remained considerably slower than initially expected, and she never displayed the rapid grammar and syntax acquisition seen in most children after the two-word-sentence stage. Her "comprehension", however, was well ahead of her speech—a similar dichotomy, albeit usually not quite as wide as hers, is typically found in young children—and she would occasionally demonstrate the ability to produce longer sentences. Evaluation was further complicated by some of Genie's difficulty with physically producing speech. Finally, scientists who later studied Genie's case thought the negative associations with vocalizing from her childhood would have had a profound effect on her speech, making it very difficult to properly assess.
Early adulthood.
In 1975, the Riglers—who had been compensated by the grant money while caring for Genie and indicated in the extension request that they needed continued compensation to sustain their guardianship—decided to end their foster parenting. David Rigler said that, from the time Genie was first admitted to Children's Hospital, their ultimate goal was to return Genie to her mother's custody, and when Genie turned 18 her mother wished to care for her. The Riglers and John Miner agreed to let Genie move back in with her mother at her childhood home. Before Genie left, the Riglers offered to assist her mother in any way they could. They signed Genie up for a summer school program, but when it ended she expressed a desire to stay at home with her mother instead of going to a summer day camp, to which they and her mother acquiesced. Despite the Riglers offers for continued assistance, after a few months Genie's mother found that taking care of Genie was both physically and financially too difficult for her to manage. Without notifying Miner or any of the scientists, she contacted the California Department of Health to find care for Genie. Genie was then transferred to the first of a succession of six foster homes, where she ended up staying for a year and a half.
In this new foster home, Genie was living with two other mentally retarded girls approximately her age. When she first moved in, social workers thought it would be an overall suitable home for her. However, they and Curtiss soon observed that the house was an extremely rigid environment, in particular noting that Genie was never allowed to play with the plastic containers she had brought with her. During her stay there, Genie again began experiencing issues with both incontinence and constipation and quickly returned to her coping mechanism of silence. Not long after she moved in, she was deeply traumatized by some of her treatment. The incident with the most severe impact occurred when she was severely beaten for vomiting and told that if she did it again she would never be allowed to see her mother, making her extremely afraid of opening her mouth for fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. Even when she was hungry she could barely eat, only opening her mouth just long enough to put food in. This fear also made her afraid to speak, rendering her almost completely silent; however, she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, so she began almost exclusively using the sign language she had learned while with the Riglers. Her mother, whom she desperately missed, was almost never permitted to visit her, causing Genie to become extremely withdrawn. At one point while she was living there, she refused to talk for five months.
Except for Curtiss, all of the scientists, including the Riglers and James Kent, were completely cut off from Genie during her stay in this foster home. Curtiss continued to meet with Genie once a week to continue her research and saw her rapid behavioral regression. She witnessed some of Genie's treatment in her new foster home, and on several occasions Genie told Curtiss she wanted to see her mother and to return to the Riglers. Curtiss quickly started petitioning to have Genie removed, but she said that because she was still only a graduate student it took a long time to get authorities to take her seriously. Upon getting social services involved both they and Curtiss had a very difficult time contacting John Miner, only succeeding after repeated attempts over several months. Once they got his attention they convinced him to attend a party with Genie, and when he saw how badly she had regressed he worked with David Rigler to get her taken out of the home. Upon leaving in April 1977, because of her previous treatment she required a two-week stay at Children's Hospital. She saw her mother and the Riglers during this time, and both her physical and mental condition moderately improved. She was then moved to another foster home until December of that year, when the arrangement collapsed. Through the end of that month into early January Genie was placed in a temporary arrangement, and subsequently moved into another foster home. In some of these subsequent homes she was further physically abused and harassed to extreme degrees, and her development continued to regress. She was often forbidden from seeing her mother for long periods of time in these homes, and except for Curtiss was completely cut off from most of the scientists. Curtiss wrote to John Miner that Genie experienced a great deal of stress whenever she had to move, and that the frequency of these moves traumatized her.
Lawsuit.
In 1976, Curtiss finished her dissertation, "Genie: A Psycholinguistic Study of a Modern-Day "Wild Child"", and it was published the following year by Academic Press; it received reviews from several prominent scientists. Its speech analysis covered Genie's utterances from admission to Children's Hospital until the early summer of 1975, and contained some excerpts of Curtiss' non-language observations from the same time frame. When Genie's mother saw a copy after its publication, despite having thought of Curtiss and Genie as friends she was reportedly very offended at the title and some of the contents. Privately she disputed some specific details, primarily regarding her husband's treatment of herself and Genie and the family's situation during Genie's captivity; however, her official complaint did not. Instead, she argued that Curtiss could only have obtained these details from her therapists or their supervisors, which would have been a breach of patient confidentiality. Genie's mother decided to sue Children's Hospital, her therapists, their supervisors, and several of the researchers both over the book and over allegations of excessive and outrageous testing, claiming the researchers gave testing priority over Genie's welfare, invaded Genie's privacy by constantly filming her, and pushed Genie far beyond the limits of her endurance, sometimes testing her between 60 and 70 hours per week.
The regional media immediately picked up the lawsuit, and the "Los Angeles Times" ran several prominent articles on it. Members of the Genie team, many of whom had not heard about Genie in years, were shocked when they found out they were being sued. David Rigler initially thought the focus of the suit would be Shurley's sleep-studies, as these were the most invasive tests conducted, but quickly found out Shurley had offered to testify against several of the other scientists. All of the researchers named in the lawsuit maintained their earlier contentions that although the tests challenged Genie, she mostly found them enjoyable and was always triumphant upon finishing. They especially emphasized that the tests were always in private and one on one, and that both she and the people testing her viewed these times as bonding experiences. Both Curtiss and David Rigler said that when a session ended, Genie was always rewarded in an emotional or material way. All of the scientists were adamant that they never coerced Genie, pointing out that this would have invalidated their results, and said Genie's mother and her lawyers grossly exaggerated the amount of time they tested Genie. Curtiss emphatically stated she never conducted testing sessions for more than 45 minutes, that Genie could take a break whenever she wanted, and that sometimes Genie herself would initiate the tests. After finishing, Curtiss said they would spend the rest of their time together, "just being friends." Rigler argued that if researchers had not done as much testing as they did, they would not have been satisfying the purpose of the grant.
The scientists responded, in addition to the allegations of overworking Genie, to concerns Genie's mother expressed about Genie's privacy and her own. Rigler maintained several times that Genie never showed signs of not wanting to be filmed, and said if she had they would have immediately stopped. Both Curtiss and Fromkin categorically denied any breach of confidentiality, asserting that the details on Genie's family were already publicly available. Curtiss pointed out that she and all of the other scientists had tried to maintain the privacy of Genie and her family, and in all their publications went to considerable lengths to keep their identities concealed. When the pending legal proceedings reached the news, Curtiss said she and all of the other scientists were extremely upset that several stories used Genie's real name and that of her mother.
At the outset, the lawyers for Genie's mother agreed there were serious problems with the scientists' testing, indicating they thought it would be possible to win a substantial judgment against them. The lawyers said that although their work with Genie almost certainly started out of goodwill, they thought publicity surrounding the case caused the scientists to lose sight of their stated goal of rehabilitating her. They pointed to the NIMH's rationale in rejecting the grant extension, arguing this should have been a sign of flaws in the scientists' research methods, and further argued that many of the tests were given so often that they only indicated Genie's familiarity with them. However, as the lawsuit went forward, the lawyers for Genie's mother increasingly felt their case was extremely tenuous at best. When they found out that Curtiss had already set up a trust fund in Genie's name and that her intention had always been to give all the royalties from her dissertation to Genie, they advised Genie's mother to take this money—a little over eight thousand dollars—and withdraw the suit. However, Jean Butler Ruch convinced her to persist and both of her lawyers withdrew, leaving her to represent herself in court. According to ABC News and Russ Rymer, the suit was settled in 1984. However, in a 1993 letter to "The New York Times" responding to a review of Rymer's book, David Rigler wrote, "he case never came to trial. It was dismissed by the Superior Court of the State of California 'with prejudice,' meaning that because it was without substance it can never again be refiled."
Post-lawsuit.
After the conclusion of the legal proceedings, despite several requests from David Rigler, Genie's mother refused to allow him or other members of the Genie team to see her. Susan Curtiss said that in late December 1977 she had been asked if she could be Genie's legal guardian, but that a week later, after a meeting with Genie in early January 1978, Genie's mother suddenly prevented Curtiss from seeing Genie and never contacted Curtiss again. Genie's post-1975 utterances and analysis of them first appeared in papers Curtiss wrote and co-wrote in 1979. After this Curtiss continued to publish papers which discussed Genie's language acquisition throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Despite the lack of new data, Curtiss and others who had worked on Genie's case continued to analyze Genie's utterances.
Genie's mother also decided to break off all contact with all of the scientists except for Jay Shurley, and moved in 1987 without leaving a forwarding address. It is not known exactly when Kent, Hansen, or the Riglers saw Genie last, but on March 30, 1978, guardianship of Genie was officially turned over to her mother and none of them saw her after that time. Genie's mother began taking Genie with her on her visits to Ruch's house, but despite being allowed to see Genie, Ruch continued spreading negative rumors about Genie's condition, hoping to convince people that Curtiss' dissertation was largely based on fabrications. Although she continued attacking many of the scientists she especially targeted Curtiss, who had become a linguistics professor at UCLA, repeatedly calling her at her house and frequently attending Curtiss' lectures to ask hostile questions.
While the lawsuit filed by Ruch had convinced Shurley, who had remained friendly with Genie's mother and Ruch, to work with her on a book detailing how the scientists had handled Genie; Shurley was self-described as, "bent on revelation". They received some encouragement from at least one other scientist familiar with the case, but after Shurley co-wrote one paper with Ruch the following year he backed out after they delivered it at a conference together, saying he was shocked at how vicious and personal her attacks on the Genie team were. Despite his cynicism about many aspects of Genie's handling, he was willing to acknowledge that the scientists had been in a completely unprecedented situation and thought Ruch's attacks were so malicious as to be sadistic. His decision earned the enmity of Ruch, who continued her campaign against the scientists until 1986, when a stroke left her with aphasia. She died in 1988 following another stroke. In the late 1980s, while Genie's mother was meeting with Jay Shurley, she declined an offer of several thousand dollars from an unidentified major news network to tell her and Genie's story despite having almost no money; when speaking about it later, Shurley commended the decision.
From January 1978 until 1993, Shurley was the only person involved in Genie's case besides Ruch who saw her. He visited her at least twice during this time, at her 27th birthday party in 1984 and again about two years later, and he said she had continued to regress. In an interview, he said on both of his visits she appeared very depressed and looked almost demented. In 1992, Curtiss said that since she last saw Genie she only had two updates on Genie's condition, both of which indicated she barely spoke and was depressed and withdrawn. When Russ Rymer published his book on Genie in February 1993, he wrote she was in a large state institution for mentally retarded adults and only saw her mother one weekend every month. In the afterword of the 1994 edition of his book, he detailed conversations he had with Genie's mother shortly before the book's publication; at that time, she indicated to him that Genie was more regularly able to visit and—though her speech was hard to understand—was reportedly more verbal.
By mid-1993, the Riglers had reestablished contact with Genie's mother and had seen Genie for the first time in 15 years. David Rigler wrote in July 1993 that, "my wife and I have resumed our (now infrequent) visits with Genie and her mother." In response to a review of Rymer's book, which repeated what Rymer had originally said about Genie's living arrangements and had further alleged Genie was being inadequately cared for and isolated, Rigler wrote that Genie was living in a small, private board and care facility and that her mother regularly visited; he did not say how long Genie had been there. His response did not indicate exactly how and when he and Marilyn got back in touch with Genie's mother, only that she had invited them to come with her on one of her visits with Genie. When the Riglers visited Genie there for the first time, David Rigler said she seemed to be happier and had immediately recognized and greeted him and Marilyn by name, but did not comment further on her mental state.
Current.
Genie is currently a ward of the state of California, and is living in an undisclosed location in the Los Angeles area. In May 2008 ABC News reported that in 2000, someone who talked to them under condition of anonymity had hired a private investigator who located Genie. She was reportedly living a relatively simple lifestyle in a small private facility for mentally underdeveloped adults, and appeared to be happy. Although she only spoke a few words, she could still communicate fairly well in sign language. In 2003, Genie's mother died of unspecified natural causes at the age of 87. In 2002 Susan Curtiss said that she still wanted to see Genie again, primarily to meet with her as a friend but also expressing interest in assessing her language; however, as of 2008, despite badly missing Genie and repeatedly attempting to find her Curtiss and James Kent had still not seen her since January 1978. In a related May 2008 interview, Genie's brother told reporters he had not seen Genie since 1982 and said he wished he had been more involved in her life. By his own account, he had refused to watch or read any accounts of Genie's case and had only recently heard any updates on her. He was glad she had gotten so much attention, and said he was happy to hear that she was reportedly doing well where she was living.
Impact.
Genie's is one of the best-known cases of language acquisition in a child with delayed development. Since Curtiss published her findings many linguistic books have used Genie's case study as an example to illustrate principles of language acquisition, frequently citing it as proof of Chomsky's theory of innate language and a modified version of Lenneberg's theory. The disparity between her linguistic abilities and her competence in other aspects of human development also suggested there was a separation of cognition and language rules, a new concept at the time. Curtiss's arguments have become widely accepted in the field of linguistics, and were the impetus for several additional studies. In addition, the question of how much language Genie learned and whether or not she had truly reached the limit of what she could acquire has remained the subject of considerable debate.
The manner in which doctors and scientists handled Genie has also been the source of debate among the people involved in the case. Years after the case study ended a few of the scientists who had been involved, including Shurley and David Elkind, expressed the view that the scientists heading the case study had put their research ahead of Genie's best interests. Both of them were among those who said that incessant fighting plagued the research team, which contributed to what they saw as the relative lack of concern about Genie's well-being. Elkind said after the initial meetings in May 1971 he declined further involvement despite his longstanding personal friendship with both the Riglers, and Shurley said the atmosphere he witnessed there made him increasingly leery of Genie's handling and caused him to minimize his involvement. Shurley also thought that Butler/Ruch had been the person who showed Genie the most love, although he acknowledged how difficult she had been for everyone else around Genie to work with, and expressed the view that the best outcome for Genie would have been to live with her. His perception of the Riglers was that, although they gave Genie a sufficient level of care, they viewed Genie as a test subject first and never showed her an adequate level of affection.
Kent, the Riglers, and Curtiss all unequivocally stated that this was never the case, and that Genie's rehabilitation was always their first priority. Both of the Riglers said they made sure to give Genie as much love and support as possible, never making love and attention contingent on her developmental progress, and pointed out that both the agency responsible for Genie's placement and the NIMH's evaluating committee wrote that Genie was happy and living well in their home. David Rigler agreed there were many unusual actions taken during the study, but said this was because the case had no good precedent. He also readily acknowledged researchers had numerous views on how to conduct research, but said with the exception of Butler/Ruch there was never any infighting between the researchers at the center of the case. The topic has since become a significant debate within the larger scientific community. 
The lack of distinction between Genie's caretakers and therapists has also come under scrutiny. Russ Rymer contended that the two roles became blurred very early on and progressively got less clear, and that the scientists were never able to recognize it because of their personal friendships. He cited the decision in 1971 to make John Miner Genie's legal guardian the point at which this began, as Hansen was both Miner's acquaintance and directly involved in providing therapy for Genie's mother. In his analysis, this grew to envelop all of the scientists involved in Genie's life and that by 1975 there were no discernible lines between the two roles. He and others, including historian Harlan Lane, have especially questioned the decision to make David Rigler a foster parent while simultaneously managing the case study, arguing that this accelerated the breakdown of the boundaries between these roles. Lane, who had been studying Victor of Aveyron at the time of Genie's case and has extensively written on the subject of feral children, emphasized this as one of the biggest flaws in the case. Later analyses of the case also argued that the instability regarding Genie's living arrangements affected her emotional state, which in turn led to her plateauing and subsequently regressing in her behavior and language.
In the 1994 "Nova" documentary on Genie, Harlan Lane suggested that the scientists found it difficult for the scientists to attain the ideal balance between research and rehabilitation; if they wanted to conduct tests on Genie they would by necessity put the goals of their experiments first, whereas if they focused on her welfare they would not be able to learn nearly as much from her. Lane pointed out that the study of Victor of Aveyron was fraught with this dilemma and ended in a somewhat similar way; after several years of working with Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, Victor's progress stopped and Itard ceased to work with him. As Victor was still unable to function on his own, he subsequently lived out the last several years of his life in a poor woman's house in Paris. Lane and several authors after him stated that the results of Genie's case and the manner in which the scientists went about conducting their research, especially given the parallels with Victor's case, would be important for future scientists working on similar cases to study.
Media.
After the Fritzl case came to the public's attention in late April 2008, ABC News ran two stories, almost two weeks apart in early May of that year, comparing the Fritzl case to Genie's. Their stories noted many of the similarities between Genie's father's abuse of his family and Josef Fritzl's imprisonment of his daughter and three of his grandchildren, and compared the physical and mental problems of the grandchildren Fritzl held captive to those which Genie displayed when she was first found. Their first story featured interviews with James Kent and Curtiss—both of whom indicated they still had not seen Genie since early 1978—as well as an interview with a British special education graduate student who was doing her dissertation on Genie's case and had established a rapport with most of the people central to it. Reporters noted they were unable to contact David Rigler, who was 87 years old, for their stories, as he was reportedly in declining health. The second story contained an interview with the police officer who arrested Genie's parents, who said he still vividly remembered the case and described some of the conditions he found inside their house.
Genie's brother, who was 56 at the time, was also interviewed for both stories, which was the first time he discussed his or Genie's life with anyone besides his ex-wife and former in-laws. In these interviews, he spoke in detail about both the abuse he saw his father inflict and about how their father abused him and forced him to keep silent. He said he only later fully understood how badly his parents had treated him and his sister; in addition to witnessing Genie's condition after escaping from their father, he said that upon leaving home he realized he was totally unprepared to live on his own. At the time of the interview, he had reportedly only just found out his mother had died. In addition, he talked about his life after escaping his parents' home; he said he spent several years drifting around the country and combating alcohol abuse, eventually becoming a house painter in Ohio, and was divorced and had a daughter and two grandchildren who lived nearby but with whom he rarely spoke. He did not say in either story whether his daughter or grandchildren had ever visited or attempted to see Genie or their mother. Finally, he indicated he was still struggling to cope with the trauma of his and Genie's upbringing, describing himself to reporters as, "a living dead man". He said that he tried to keep it out of his memory as much as possible, though he kept and shared pieces of a small collection of family photographs from his early childhood and a few letters and pictures his mother sent him in the 1980s.
Books.
Russ Rymer.
Author Russ Rymer wrote a two-part magazine article in "The New Yorker" entitled "Genie: A Silent Childhood" which ran in mid-April 1992, and the next year published a book—his first—called "Genie: A Scientific Tragedy". The works cover Genie's life up until the time of publication, as well as the scientific team who studied her; in addition, the book also summarizes the life of Victor of Aveyron and Jean Marc Gaspard Itard's work with him, discussing the movie "The Wild Child" and its effect on the public's view of both Victor's case and of feral children in general at length, and compares Victor and Genie and their respective handling by researchers. With the exception of Curtiss, who he acknowledges was working primarily out of compassion, Rymer posited that the other scientists pursued the study chiefly for the advancement of their own careers and egos, constantly fighting for control over the direction of the study and credit for the work and research being done.
For the writings, Rymer interviewed many of the scientists central to the case study, including Curtiss, James Kent, Howard Hansen, the Riglers, and Jay Shurley, as well as John Miner, Ursula Bellugi, and other scientists who were more peripherally involved. At the suggestion of David Rigler, Rymer interviewed the lawyers who had represented Genie's mother when she attempted to sue the scientists. To give further insight into the functioning of Genie's brain, he also spoke with psychologist and neurologist Helen Neville, who had been a graduate student studying different critical periods in cats under Eric Lenneberg at the time of Genie's case. Rymer was also given access to several collections of videos and documents pertaining to the case, including Butler/Ruch's personal journal, as well as some correspondence between Genie's mother and her lawyers. Although Rymer documented the case almost entirely from the scientists' perspectives, Genie's mother provided him with many of these documents, which he said was necessary to finish expanding his original magazine articles to a full book. He also wrote that when first started attempting to write the book he experienced far more difficulty than anticipated, and largely to distance himself from his work spent a year in Paris; when he found himself constantly focused on Genie, he decided to interview several historians about Victor of Aveyron and visited the Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, where Victor had lived while working with Itard.
Rymer wrote in the book that many of the scientists only very reluctantly spoke about the case, and that by the time he spoke to them they had mostly lost contact with one another. In November 1993, Rymer added an afterword for the 1994 edition of his book in which he said there had been a rift between many of the scientists. He said his interviews had caused some of the scientists to start speaking to each other again, and specifically wrote he had some role in reopening communication between the Riglers and Genie's mother. Rymer also indicated that, due to his book's attempts to reconcile the scientists' frequently disparate accounts, he had anticipated at least some of them would have a strong negative reaction to it. In a 2008 interview Rymer said he was still scarred from covering the case, and said the divisions to which he had previously alluded made the book extremely difficult to write.
Reception.
Rymer's New Yorker magazine articles were met with good reviews. The book was one of five finalists for the 1993 National Book Critics Circle Awards, in the category of general non-fiction. Upon its publication, it received several prominent reviews. Among them were an overall positive reception in the "Los Angeles Times" from author Nancy Mairs and in the "New York Times" from scientific reporter Natalie Angier; Angier, whose review was published in late April 1993, wrote she had previously read both of the magazine articles, and took an extremely negative view of the scientists.
Angier's review garnered very harsh criticism from Susan Curtiss and James Kent, who strongly disagreed with both the review and the book, and prompted David Rigler to make his first public statement on Genie's case. In a letter to the New York Times published in mid-June 1993, Rigler wrote that Angier's review was unfairly critical of the scientists, pointing to what he said were several major factual inaccuracies throughout her review of the book and the entire case. The review contained scathing criticism of the way in which the scientists ran the case study, claiming there was constant in-fighting throughout its course, which Rigler said was a clear misrepresentation of both Rymer's book and what had actually occurred. Angier also claimed that during the time Genie's mother attempted to sue the scientists, they made numerous public accusations and filed several lawsuits against each other—except for detailing Ruch's attacks, which were undisputed, Rymer's book contained nothing which substantiated these allegations. Rigler wrote none of them publicly spoke about the case during the legal proceedings, and denied any of the scientists were ever involved in litigation against each other.
Other books.
Several books about feral and/or abused children contain chapters on Genie. Many books on linguistics and psychology also speak about Genie's case. In 2005, scientist Temple Grandin briefly discussed Genie's case in her book Animals in Translation. In it she questioned what useful information about humans and language acquisition could be extrapolated from cases such as Genie's because the levels of abuse and isolation Genie underwent was so extreme, and suggested that studies of autistic children and deaf adults who did not have the opportunity to learn sign language as children would yield more useful results. Linguists Steven Pinker and Geoffrey Sampson have also discussed Genie's case, using it to argue for and against Chomsky's theory on the innateness of language respectively.
Film and television.
In 1994, "Nova" made a documentary on Genie titled "Secret of the Wild Child". It was aired by PBS in the United States and by the BBC in the United Kingdom. Narrated by Stacy Keach, the documentary covered Genie's life up until the time the lawsuit was starting to be filed, mentioning Genie's then-current living arrangements at the end. The credits state that Rymer's book provided the basis for the documentary, and like that work it features segments on and comparisons to Victor of Aveyron and his handling by scientists. It featured previously unreleased pictures and film of Genie, both by herself and working with people on the research team, and showed both footage and interviews with many of the scientists involved in Genie's case and both of the lawyers initially representing Genie's mother in 1977. For the sections primarily focused on Victor, the documentary showed interviews with Harlan Lane in locations where Victor had lived different parts of his life. The archived film "Nova" used from the UCLA library had significantly deteriorated, and required restoration for use in the documentary. Upon broadcast, the episode received positive reviews. The documentary won multiple Emmy Awards for news and documentary programming, in the category of informational or cultural programming, in both 1994 and 1995.
In 2002, an episode of the television series Body Shock on feral children entitled "Wild Child" included a segment on Genie. The episode was aired by Channel 4 in the UK and on TLC in the United States. It discussed Genie's life until the time of the lawsuit, and at the end briefly mentioned she was still a ward of the state in California and that Susan Curtiss was still searching for Genie. The segment on Genie featured film of her, both by herself and with Curtiss, and showed pictures of Genie's family and clips of news footage showing her parents immediately after their arrests. It also showed interviews with one of the police officers who arrested Genie's parents, a neighbor of Genie's parents during the time Genie was held in captivity, Curtiss, and James Kent, and showed Curtiss and Kent meeting with each other. The interview with the police officer was shot outside Genie's childhood house, where he pointed out one of the windows to Genie's room. To explain how Genie's brain became extremely right-hemisphere dominant, the segment showed an interview with child psychologist and neurologist Bruce D. Perry. The episode received a positive review in The Guardian.
The independent film "Mockingbird Don't Sing", released in 2001, is based on Genie's case. Written by Daryl Haney and directed by Harry Bromley Davenport, it followed Genie's life until sometime just before her mother filed the lawsuit, at which point the film ends and messages flash across the screen informing viewers of what happened after the film's timeline. The film was written primarily from the perspective of Susan Curtiss, the only person who worked with Genie to be involved in its making. The DVD extras contain an interview with Curtiss, in which she discusses some of the aspects of grammar Genie could and could not acquire. Bromley Davenport said he was very sentimental about the movie and researched Genie's case for two years for it, recording around 40 hours of interviews with Curtiss; in an interview he concurred with Curtiss' negative assessment of Rymer's works, and said he thought very highly of Curtiss' work with Genie. For legal reasons, all of the names in the movie were changed. Upon its release, it met with mixed reviews. The movie tied for first place as the best screenplay at the 2001 Rhode Island International Film Festival.

Catherine Repond

Catherine Repond (18 August 1663 in Villarvolard – 15 September 1731 in Freiburg), was an alleged Swiss witch. She was one of the last people to be executed for sorcery in Switzerland prior to Anna Göldi.
In 1730, the bailiff Beat-Nicolas von Montenach, out hunting, injured a fox; the fox got away but, according to Montenach, shouted to him, with a human voice, that he had hurt it. At the same time, Catherine Repond sought refuge at a farm close to Villargiroud away from the bad weather. She was a beggar, reputed for sorcery, well known in the area, where she often performed chores at the farms. She had the same injuries which the fox had had, according to Montenach. Montenach then suspected that the fox had in fact been Repond. 
Montenach had her arrested in April 1731 and taken to his castle in Corbières, where she was interrogated by torture to confess that she had flown on a broomstick to the witche's sabbath. She was then taken to Fribourg, where she was sentenced to death for witchcraft and executed by strangulation and burning. 
In 1782, Anna Göldi, often called the last witch, was executed, but Göldi's trial was a dubious witch trial, while Repond was openly executed for this accusation.

Lake Lefroy

Lake Lefroy is a large salt lake in southern Western Australia. It is north of Lake Cowan and approximately south of Boulder. The towns of Kambalda and Widgiemooltha are both located along the western shore of the lake. 
Overview.
The lake is ephemeral and rarely contains any water, it is a clay pan covered with a crust of salt that supports little vegetation.
To access the lake permission must be obtained from Western Mining offices . 
The lake was named by the explorer Charles Cooke Hunt in 1864 after fellow explorer Henry Maxwell Lefroy who had conducted an expedition in the area with Henry Landor in 1863.
In 1896 gold was discovered on the northern edge of the lake by the prospector Pierce Larkin. Approximately of gold were found near where Kambalda stands today.
The lake is widely used for land sailing, and is considered by many all over the world to be one of the best places to sail a land yacht due to its size and the texture of its surface. The lake and its surface have been used in the past for Australian land speed record attempts and also hosted the 2007 Pacrim Land Sailing Event in which competitors from all over the world descended on its flat smooth surface. In 2008, an English adventurer spent two weeks on the lake with his own designed and built yacht to attempt the world wind powered vehicle record but Mother Nature failed to help out.
