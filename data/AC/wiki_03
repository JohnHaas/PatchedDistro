Stream

A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks. Depending on its locale or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a "branch", "brook", "beck", "burn", "creek", "crick", "gill" (occasionally "ghyll"), "kill", "lick", "mill race", "rill", "river", "syke", "bayou", "rivulet", "streamage", "wash", "run" or "runnel".
Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and corridors for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone. Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as "surface hydrology" and is a core element of environmental geography.
Other names.
In the United Kingdom, there are several regional names for a stream:
In North America:
Sources.
Streams typically derive most of their water from precipitation in the form of rain and snow. Most of this water re-enters the atmosphere by evaporation from soil and water bodies, or by the evapotranspiration of plants. Some of the water proceeds to sink into the earth by infiltration and becomes groundwater, much of which eventually enters streams. Some precipitated water is temporarily locked up in snow fields and glaciers, to be released later by evaporation or melting. The rest of the water flows off the land as runoff, the proportion of which varies according to many factors, such as wind, humidity, vegetation, rock types, and relief. This runoff starts as a thin film called sheet wash, combined with a network of tiny rills, together constituting sheet runoff; when this water is concentrated in a channel, a stream has its birth. Some creeks may start from ponds or lakes.
Characteristics.
To qualify as a stream it must be either recurring or perennial. Recurring (intermittent) streams have water in the channel for at least part of the year. A stream of the first order is a stream which does not have any other recurring or perennial stream feeding into it. When two first-order streams come together, they form a second-order stream. When two second-order streams come together, they form a third-order stream. Streams of lower order joining a higher order stream do not change the order of the higher stream. Thus, if a first-order stream joins a second-order stream, it remains a second-order stream. It is not until a second-order stream combines with another second-order stream that it becomes a third-order stream.
The "gradient" of a stream is a critical factor in determining its character and is entirely determined by its base level of erosion. The base level of erosion is the point at which the stream either enters the ocean, a lake or pond, or enters a stretch in which it has a much lower gradient, and may be specifically applied to any particular stretch of a stream.
In geologic terms, the stream will erode down through its bed to achieve the base level of erosion throughout its course. If this base level is low, then the stream will rapidly cut through underlying strata and have a steep gradient, and if the base level is relatively high, then the stream will form a flood plain and meander.
Meanders are looping changes of direction of a stream caused by the erosion and deposition of bank materials. These are typically serpentine in form. Typically, over time the meanders gradually migrate downstream.
If some resistant material slows or stops the downstream movement of a meander, a stream may erode through the neck between two legs of a meander to become temporarily straighter, leaving behind an arc-shaped body of water termed an "oxbow lake" or "bayou". A flood may also cause a meander to be cut through in this way.
Typically, streams are said to have a particular "profile", beginning with steep gradients, no flood plain, and little shifting of channels, eventually evolving into streams with low gradients, wide flood plains, and extensive meanders. The initial stage is sometimes termed a "young" or "immature" stream, and the later state a "mature" or "old" stream. However, a stream may meander for some distance before falling into a "young" stream condition.
Streams can carry sediment, or alluvium. The amount of load it can carry (capacity) as well as the largest object it can carry (competence) are both dependent on the velocity of the stream.
Intermittent and ephemeral streams.
A "perennial stream" is one which flows continuously all year. 
Some perennial streams may only have continuous flow in segments of its stream bed year round during years of normal rainfall.
Blue-line streams are perennial streams and are marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line. 
Intermittent stream.
In the United States, an "intermittent" or seasonal stream is one that only flows for part of the year and is marked on topographic maps with a line of blue dashes and dots. A "wash" or "desert wash" is normally a dry streambed in the deserts of the American Southwest which flows only after significant rainfall. Washes can fill up quickly during rains, and there may be a sudden torrent of water after a thunderstorm begins upstream, such as during monsoonal conditions. These flash floods often catch travelers by surprise. An intermittent stream can also be called an arroyo in Latin America, a winterbourne in Britain, or a wadi in the Arabic-speaking world.
In Italy an intermittent stream is termed a torrent . In full flood the stream may or may not be "torrential" in the dramatic sense of the word, but there will be one or more seasons in which the flow is reduced to a trickle or less. Typically torrents have Apennine rather than Alpine sources, and in the summer they are fed by little precipitation and no melting snow. In this case the maximum discharge will be during the spring and autumn. However there are also glacial torrents with a different seasonal regime.
In Australia, an intermittent stream is usually called a creek and marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line.
Ephemeral stream.
Generally, streams that flow only during and immediately after precipitation are termed "ephemeral". There is no clear demarcation between surface runoff and an ephemeral stream.
Drainage basins.
The extent of land basin drained by a stream is termed its drainage basin (also known in North America as the watershed and, in British English, as a catchment). A basin may also be composed of smaller basins. For instance, the Continental Divide in North America divides the mainly easterly-draining Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean basins from the largely westerly-flowing Pacific Ocean basin. The Atlantic Ocean basin, however, may be further subdivided into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico drainages. (This delineation is termed the Eastern Continental Divide.) Similarly, the Gulf of Mexico basin may be divided into the Mississippi River basin and several smaller basins, such as the Tombigbee River basin. Continuing in this vein, a component of the Mississippi River basin is the Ohio River basin, which in turn includes the Kentucky River basin, and so forth.

Sea

The sea, the world ocean, or simply the ocean, is the connected body of salty water that covers over 70 percent of the Earth's surface. It moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been travelled and explored since ancient times, the scientific study of the seaâoceanographyâdates broadly from the voyages of Captain James Cook who explored the Pacific Ocean between 1768 and 1779. In geography, "sea" is used in the names of smaller, partly landlocked sections of the ocean, for example the Irish Sea, while "ocean" is used in the names of the five largest sections, such as the Pacific Ocean.
The most abundant ions in sea water are chloride and sodium. The water also contains magnesium, sulfate, calcium, potassium, and many other components, some in minute concentrations. Salinity varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however the "relative" proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the oceans. Carbon dioxide from the air is currently being absorbed by the sea in increasing amounts, lowering seawater pH in a process known as ocean acidification, which is likely to damage marine ecosystems in the near future.
Winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce waves, which break when they reach shallow water. Winds also create surface currents through friction, setting up slow but stable circulations of water throughout the oceans. The directions of the circulation are governed by factors including the shapes of the continents and the rotation of the earth (the Coriolis effect). Deep-sea currents, known as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean. Tides, the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by the rotation of the Earth and the gravitational effects of the orbiting Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun. Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries. Destructive tsunamis can be caused by submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans, volcano eruptions, huge landslides, or the impact of large meteorites.
A wide variety of life, including viruses, bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi and animals, lives in the sea, which offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems, ranging from sunlit surface waters to the enormous depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone. The sea also varies in latitude from the cold waters beneath the Arctic ice to the colourful diversity of coral reefs in the tropics. Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started there.
The sea provides people with substantial supplies of food, mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals and seaweed, whether harvested in the wild or farmed underwater. Overexploitation of these food resources has become a major problem. The sea also serves other purposes, including trade, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and leisure activities such as swimming, surfing, sailing and scuba diving. The sea also suffers from marine pollution. The sea has played an important part in culture throughout history, with major appearances in literature at least since Homer's "Odyssey", in marine art, in cinema, in theater, and in classical music. Symbolically, the sea appears as monsters such as Scylla in mythology and represents the unconscious mind in dream interpretation.
Definition.
The sea is the interconnected system of all the Earth's oceanic waters, including the five named "oceans", the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern and Arctic Oceans. The word "sea" is used in the names of specific, smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though seas are smaller, and are partly (as marginal seas) or wholly (as inland seas) bordered by land, on a smaller scale than say the Atlantic Ocean. However, the Sargasso Sea has no coastline and lies within a circular current, the North Atlantic Gyre. Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water, but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states that all of the ocean is "sea".
Physical science.
Earth is the only planet in the Solar System with liquid surface water, but Earthlike planets in extrasolar planetary systems may have oceans. The sea covers more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface with liquid water. About 97.2 percent of the Earth's water is found in the sea, some of salty water. Of the rest, 2.15 percent is accounted for by ice in glaciers, surface deposits and sea ice, and 0.65 percent by vapour and liquid fresh water in lakes, rivers, the ground and the air. Seen from space, our planet appears as a "blue marble" of various forms of water: salty oceans, sea ice, clouds. The science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke once suggested that "Earth" should have been named "Ocean" as the sea is its dominant feature.
Physical oceanography, or marine physics, studies the ocean's physical attributes including temperature-salinity structure, mixing, waves, internal waves, surface tides, internal tides, and currents. The movement of water in the form of currents, tides and waves affects the coastline and modifies the climate of coastal regions. The physical geography of the sea involves the study of the shape and extent of the ocean basins and of the coastlines of lands bordering on the sea. The structure and relief of the seabed provide evidence of the materials of which the Earth is made, continental drift, the distribution of zones of seismic and volcanic activity and the accumulation of sedimentary material which may eventually form sedimentary rocks.
Seawater.
The water in the sea was once thought to come from the Earth's volcanoes, starting 4 billion years ago, released by degassing from molten rock. More recent work suggests that much of the Earth's water may have come from comets. An important characteristic of seawater is that it is salty. Salinity is usually measured in parts per thousand (expressed with the â° sign or "per mil"), and the open ocean has about of solids per litre, a salinity of 35â° (about 90% of the water in the ocean has between 34â° and 35â° salinity). The Mediterranean Sea is slightly higher at 37â°. The constituents of table salt, sodium and chloride, make up about 85 percent of the solids in solution. There are also other metal ions such as magnesium and calcium, and negative ions including sulphate, carbonate, and bromide. Despite variations in the levels of salinity in different seas, the relative composition of the dissolved salts is stable throughout the world's oceans. Seawater is too saline for humans to drink safely, as the kidneys cannot excrete urine as salty as seawater. In contrast, some landlocked hypersaline lakes have a much higher salinity; for example, the Dead Sea has of dissolved solids per litre (300Â â°).
The salinity of a body of water varies with evaporation from its surface (increased by high temperatures, wind and wave motion), precipitation, the freezing or melting of sea ice, the melting of glaciers, the influx of fresh river water, and the mixing of bodies of water of different salinities. The Baltic Sea, for example, is in a cool climatic region with low evaporation, has many rivers flowing into it and intermittent replenishment from the North Sea which creates a cold, dense under layer that hardly mixes with the surface layers. The uppermost layer may have a salinity of 10 to 15Â â°, with even lower levels in the estuaries. The warm Red Sea has high evaporation but little precipitation; few rivers flow into it, and the Bab-el-Mandeb, joining it to the Gulf of Aden, is narrow, so its salinity averages 40 â°.
Sea temperature depends on the amount of solar radiation falling on its surface. In the tropics, with the sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over while near the poles the temperature in equilibrium with the sea ice is about . There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, and the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and density of the water, before eventually welling up again towards the surface. Deep seawater has a temperature between and in all parts of the globe.
Seawater has a freezing point of about â1.8Â Â°C (28.8Â Â°F). When its temperature becomes low enough, ice crystals form on the surface. These break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as frazil. In calm conditions this freezes into a thin flat sheet known as nilas, which thickens as new ice forms on its underside. In more turbulent seas, frazil crystals join together into flat discs known as pancakes. These slide under each other and coalesce to form floes. In the process of freezing, salt water and air are trapped between the ice crystals. Nilas may have a salinity of 12â15Â â°, but by the time the sea ice is one year old, this falls to 4â6Â â°.
The amount of oxygen found in seawater depends primarily on the plants growing in it. These are mainly algae, including phytoplankton, with some vascular plants such as seagrasses. In daylight the photosynthetic activity of these plants produces oxygen, which dissolves in the seawater and is used by marine animals. At night, photosynthesis stops, and the amount of dissolved oxygen declines. In the deep sea, where insufficient light penetrates for plants to grow, there is very little dissolved oxygen. In its absence, organic material is broken down by anaerobic bacteria producing hydrogen sulphide. Global warming is likely to reduce levels of oxygen both in surface waters, due to decreased solubility of oxygen in water at higher temperatures, and in deep waters, due to increased stratification.
The amount of light that penetrates the sea depends on the angle of the sun, the weather conditions and the turbidity of the water. Much light gets reflected at the surface, and red light gets absorbed in the top few metres. Yellow and green light reach greater depths, and blue and violet light may penetrate as deep as . There is insufficient light for photosynthesis and plant growth beyond a depth of about .
Ocean acidification.
Seawater is slightly alkaline and had a preindustrial pH of about 8.2. More recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30â40% of the added CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic acid and lowering the pH (now below 8.1) through a process called ocean acidification (see The carbon cycle). The pH is expected to reach 7.7 (representing a 3-fold increase in hydrogen ion concentration) by the year 2100, which is a significant change in a century.
One important element for the formation of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below the carbonate compensation depth. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.
The current rate of ocean chemistry change appears to be without precedent in Earth's geological history, making it unclear how well marine ecosystems will be able to adapt to the shifting conditions of the near future. Of particular concern is the manner in which the combination of acidification with the expected additional stressors of higher temperatures and lower oxygen levels will impact the seas.
Ocean surface waves.
Wind blowing over the surface of a body of water forms waves that are perpendicular to the direction of the wind. The friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes ripples to form. A strong blow over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are travelling nearly matches the speed of the wind. In open water, when the wind blows continuously (as happens in the Southern Hemisphere in the Roaring Forties), long, organised masses of water called swell roll across the ocean. If the wind dies down, the wave formation is reduced, but already-formed waves continue to travel in their original direction until they meet land. The size of the waves depends on the fetch (the distance that the wind has blown over the water) and the strength and duration of that wind. When waves meet others coming from different directions, interference between the two can produce broken, irregular seas.
The top of a wave is known as the crest; the lowest point between waves is the trough; and the distance between the crests is the wavelength. The wave is pushed across the surface of the sea by the wind, but this represents a transfer of energy and not a horizontal movement of water. When a wave approaches, the water molecules at a point rise up and when the wave retreats, they go down, moving in a roughly circular pattern each time a wave passes. Those near the surface move more than those lower down. When waves approach land and move into shallow water, they change their behaviour. If approaching at an angle, waves may bend or wrap around objects such as rocks or headlands. When the deepest oscillating molecules in a wave come into contact with the seabed, friction between the water and the beach slows the wave down, the crests become closer together and the amplitude increases. The wave changes profile as the crest moves faster than the base and eventually, the wave "breaks" as it topples forward, becoming a tumbling mass of foamy water. This rushes in a sheet up the beach before retreating into the sea under the influence of gravity.
Tsunami.
A tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave, a tsunami, radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water and which therefore travels much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. In the deep open sea, tsunamis have wavelengths of around , travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (970Â km/h) and usually have a height of less than three feet, so they often pass unnoticed at this stage. In contrast, ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet, travel at up to and are up to high.
A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually, but is spread out over the wave front, so as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will, on average, be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions, and this affects the direction of the wave frontâan effect known as refractionâwhich can focus the strength of the advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography.
As a tsunami moves into shallower water its speed decreases, its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously, behaving in the same way as a wind-generated wave in shallow water, but on a vastly greater scale. Either the trough or the crest of a tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas close to the shore exposed which provides a useful warning for people on land. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, flooding all in its path. Much of the destruction may be caused by the flood water draining back into the sea after the tsunami has struck, dragging debris and people with it. Often several tsunami are caused by a single geological event and arrive at intervals of between eight minutes and two hours. The first wave to arrive on shore may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, a tsunami may transform into a bore, typically in a shallow bay or an estuary. Tsunami warning systems rely on the fact that seismic waves caused by earthquakes travel around the world at around per hour, allowing threatened regions to be alerted to the possibility of a tsunami. Measurements from a network of sea-level measuring stations make it possible to confirm or cancel a tsunami warning.
Currents.
Wind blowing over the surface of the sea causes friction at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move in the same direction as the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic and one in the Indian Ocean. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, and that flowing in the reverse direction has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.
Surface currents only affect the top few hundred metres (yards) of the sea, but there are also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt. This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser, and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses on either side of the Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.
Besides gyres, there are temporary surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along parallel to the coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach at right angles to the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach and the more oblique the wave approach, the stronger is the longshore current. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of per second, can form at different places at different stages of the tide and can carry away unwary bathers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.
Tides.
Tides are the regular rise and fall in water level experienced by seas and oceans in response to the gravitational influences of the Moon and the Sun, and the effects of the Earth's rotation. During each tidal cycle, at any given place the water rises to a maximum height known as "high tide" before ebbing away again to the minimum "low tide" level. As the water recedes, it uncovers more and more of the foreshore, also known as the intertidal zone. The difference in height between the high tide and low tide is known as the tidal range or tidal amplitude.
Most places experience two high tides each day, occurring at intervals of about 12 hours and 25 minutes. This is half the 24 hours and 50 minute period that it takes for the Earth to make a complete revolution and return the Moon to its previous position relative to an observer. The Moon's mass is some 27Â million times smaller than the Sun, but it is 400 times closer to the Earth. Tidal force or tide-raising force decreases rapidly with distance, so the moon has more than twice as great an effect on tides as the Sun. A bulge is formed in the ocean at the place where the Earth is closest to the Moon, because it is also where the effect of the Moon's gravity is stronger. On the opposite side of the Earth, the lunar force is at its weakest and this causes another bulge to form. As the Moon rotates around the Earth, so do these ocean bulges move around the Earth. The gravitational attraction of the Sun is also working on the seas, but its effect on tides is less powerful than that of the Moon, and when the Sun, Moon and Earth are all aligned (full moon and new moon), the combined effect results in the high "spring tides". In contrast, when the Sun is at 90Â° from the Moon as viewed from Earth, the combined gravitational effect on tides is less causing the lower "neap tides".
Tidal flows of seawater are resisted by the water's inertia and can be affected by land masses. In places like the Gulf of Mexico where land constrains the movement of the bulges, only one set of tides may occur each day. Inshore from an island there may be a complex daily cycle with four high tides. The island straits at Chalkis on Euboea experience strong currents which abruptly switch direction, generally four times per day but up to 12 times per day when the moon and the sun are 90 degrees apart. Where there is a funnel-shaped bay or estuary, the tidal range can be magnified. The Bay of Fundy is the classic example of this and can experience spring tides of . Although tides are regular and predictable, the height of high tides can be lowered by offshore winds and raised by onshore winds. The high pressure at the centre of an anticyclones pushes down on the water and is associated with abnormally low tides while low-pressure areas may cause extremely high tides. A storm surge can occur when high winds pile water up against the coast in a shallow area and this, coupled with a low pressure system, can raise the surface of the sea at high tide dramatically. In 1900, Galveston, Texas experienced a surge during a hurricane that overwhelmed the city, killing over 3,500 people and destroying 3,636 homes.
Ocean basins.
The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. On land the crust is known as the continental crust while under the sea it is known as the oceanic crust. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometres (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes, heat is produced and magma is forced up creating underwater mountains, some of which may form chains of volcanic islands near to deep trenches. Near some of the boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.
The Earth's deepest trench is the Mariana Trench which extends for about across the seabed. It is near the Mariana Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the West Pacific, and though it averages just wide, its deepest point is 10.994 kilometres (nearly 7 miles) below the surface of the sea. An even longer trench runs alongside the coast of Peru and Chile, reaching a depth of and extending for approximately . It occurs where the oceanic Nazca Plate slides under the continental South American Plate and is associated with the upthrust and volcanic activity of the Andes.
Coasts.
The zone where land meets sea is known as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by splashing waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory is known as a cape. The indentation of a coastline, especially between two headlands, is a bay, a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute and these are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves as the swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. This tends to undercut the cliff, and normal weathering processes such as the action of frost follows, causing further destruction. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops at the foot of the cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.
Material worn from the margins of the land eventually ends up in the sea. Here it is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport sand and pebbles away from their place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides and currents. Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding of the land by the building of breakwaters, seawalls and other sea defences. The Thames Barrier is designed to protect London from a storm surge and dykes and levees are built to control water flow and protect land reclaimed from the sea from inundation. One of the longest man-made embankments is the Mississippi levee system, extending about along the river from Cape Girardeau on the Mississippi Delta, and its aim is to protect the city of New Orleans. Hong Kong International Airport was built on a large artificial island, formed by levelling two existing islands and reclaiming of the adjacent seabed.
Sea level.
Over most of geologic time, the sea level has been higher than it is today. The main factor affecting sea level over time is the result of changes in the oceanic crust, with a downward trend expected to continue in the very long term. At the last glacial maximum, some 20,000 years ago, the sea level was below its present-day level. For at least the last 100 years, sea level has been rising at an average rate of about per year. Most of this rise can be attributed to an increase in the temperature of the sea and the resulting slight thermal expansion of the upper of water. Additional contributions, as much as one quarter of the total, come from water sources on land, such as melting snow and glaciers and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human needs. The rising trend from global warming is expected to continue until at least the end of the 21st century.
The water cycle.
The sea plays a part in the water or hydrological cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the atmosphere as vapour, condenses, falls as rain or snow, thereby sustaining life on land, and largely returns to the sea. Even in the Atacama Desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca blow in from the sea and support plant life.
In central Asia and other large land masses, there are endorheic basins which have no outlet to the sea, separated from the ocean by mountains or other natural geologic features that prevent the water draining away. The Caspian Sea is the largest of these. Its main inflow is the River Volga, there is no outflow and the evaporation of water makes it saline as dissolved minerals accumulate. The Aral Sea in central Asia and Pyramid Lake in the western United States are further examples of large, inland saline water-bodies without drainage. Some endorheic lakes are less salty, but all are sensitive to variations in the quality of the inflowing water.
The carbon cycle.
Oceans contain the greatest quantity of actively cycled carbon in the world and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer and it remains there for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.
Carbon enters the ocean as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolves in the surface layers and is converted into carbonic acid, bicarbonate and carbonate: CO2 (aq) + H2O formula_1 H2CO3 formula_1 HCO3â + H+ formula_1 CO32â + 2 H+. The process liberates hydrogen ions (), thus decreasing ocean pH.
It can also enter through rivers as dissolved organic carbon and is converted by photosynthetic organisms into organic carbon. This can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or being returned to surface waters through thermohaline circulation.
Life in the sea.
The oceans are home to a diverse collection of life forms that use it as a habitat. Since sunlight illuminates only the upper layers, the major part of the ocean exists in permanent darkness. As the different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species, the marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life. Marine habitats range from surface water to the deepest oceanic trenches, including coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky seabeds, and the open pelagic zone. The organisms living in the sea range from whales 30 metres (100Â ft) long to microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton, fungi, bacteria and viruses, including recently discovered marine bacteriophages which live parasitically inside bacteria. Marine life plays an important part in the carbon cycle as photosynthetic organisms convert dissolved carbon dioxide into organic carbon and it is economically important to humans for providing fish for use as food.
Life may have originated in the sea and all the major groups of animals are represented there. Scientists differ as to precisely where in the sea life arose: the Miller-Urey experiments suggested a dilute chemical "soup" in open water, but more recent suggestions include volcanic hot springs, fine-grained clay sediments, or deep-sea "black smoker" vents, all of which would have provided protection from damaging ultraviolet radiation which was not blocked by the early earth's atmosphere.
Marine habitats.
Marine habitats can be divided horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline to the edge of the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed) and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from polar seas with ice shelves, sea ice and icebergs, to temperate and tropical waters.
Coral reefs, the so-called "rainforests of the sea", occupy less than 0.1 percent of the world's ocean surface, yet their ecosystems include 25 percent of all marine species. The best-known are tropical coral reefs such as Australia's Great Barrier Reef, but cold water reefs harbour a wide array of species including corals (only six of which contribute to reef formation).
Algae and plants.
Marine primary producers â plants and microscopic organisms in the plankton â are widespread and very diverse. Microscopic photosynthetic algae, phytoplankton, contribute a larger proportion of the world's photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined. About 45 percent of the sea's primary production of living material is contributed by diatoms. Much larger algae, commonly known as seaweeds, are important locally; "Sargassum" forms floating drifts, while kelp form seabed forests. Flowering plants in the form of seagrasses grow in "meadows" in sandy shallows, mangroves line the coast in tropical and subtropical regions and salt-tolerant plants thrive in regularly inundated salt marshes. All of these habitats are able to sequester large quantities of carbon and support a biodiverse range of larger and smaller animal life.
Light is only able to penetrate the top so this is the only part of the sea where plants can grow. The surface layers are often deficient in biologically active nitrogen compounds. The marine nitrogen cycle consists of complex microbial transformations which include the fixation of nitrogen, its assimilation, nitrification, anammox and denitrification. Some of these processes take place in deep water so that where there is an upwelling of cold waters, and also near estuaries where land-sourced nutrients are present, plant growth is higher. This means that the most productive areas, rich in plankton and therefore also in fish, are mainly coastal.
Animals and other marine life.
There is a broader spectrum of higher animal taxa in the sea than on land, many marine species have yet to be discovered and the number known to science is expanding annually. Some vertebrates such as seabirds, seals and sea turtles return to the land to breed but fish, cetaceans and sea snakes have a completely aquatic lifestyle and many invertebrate phyla are entirely marine. In fact, the oceans teem with life and provide many varying microhabitats. One of these is the surface film which, even though tossed about by the movement of waves, provides a rich environment and is home to bacteria, fungi, microalgae, protozoa, fish eggs and various larvae.
The pelagic zone contains macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most of the smallest organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously sized fish and other nektonic organisms to large squid, sharks, porpoises, dolphins and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to other regions of the ocean on a seasonal basis or vertical migrations daily, often ascending to feed at night and descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels.
The demersal zone supports many animals that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators and the seabed provides a range of habitats on or under the surface of the substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to the dehydrating air is home to barnacles, molluscs and crustaceans. The neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, among algal encrusted rocks live sponges, echinoderms, polychaete worms, sea anemones and other invertebrates. Corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. These provide a biodiverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life on the floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the seabed live demersal fish that feed largely on pelagic organisms or benthic invertebrates. Exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the seabed that scientists had not previously known to exist. Some like the detritivores rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. Others cluster round deep sea hydrothermal vents where mineral-rich flows of water emerge from the seabed, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidising chemoautotrophic bacteria, and whose consumers include specialised bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms and fish, often found nowhere else. A dead whale sinking to the bottom of the ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. Such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered.
Humans and the sea.
Navigation and exploration.
Humans have travelled the seas since they first built sea-going craft. The ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians explored the Mediterranean and Red Sea with the Egyptian Hannu reaching the Arabian Peninsula and the African Coast around 2750 BC. In the 1st millennium BC, Phoenicians and Greeks established colonies throughout the Mediterranean and the Black Sea and the first lighthouse, the Pharos of Alexandria, was built to guide mariners in the 3rd century BC. The seas along the eastern and southern Asian coast were used by Arab and Chinese traders and the Polynesians performed great feats of navigation, travelling thousands of miles between tiny islands. In the early Mediaeval period, the Vikings crossed the North Atlantic and possibly reached the Indian Ocean.
In the late fifteenth century, Western European mariners started making longer voyages of exploration in search of trade. Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 and Vasco da Gama reached India via the Cape in 1498. Christopher Columbus sailed from Cadiz in 1492, attempting to reach the eastern lands of India and Japan by the novel means of travelling westwards. He made landfall instead on an island in the Caribbean Sea and a few years later, the Venetian navigator John Cabot reached Newfoundland. The Italian Amerigo Vespucci, after whom America was named, explored the South American coastline in voyages made between 1497 and 1502, including the mouth of the Amazon River. In 1519 the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan led the first expedition to sail around the world. In 1594 the Dutch captain Willem Barentsz reached Svalbard and the Barents Sea. By no means all mediaeval navigators were from Western Europe. Novgorodians had been sailing the White Sea since the 13th century or before. The Chinese Ming Dynasty had a fleet of 317 ships with 37,000 men under Zheng He in the early fifteenth century, sailing the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Gerardus Mercator made a practical map of the world in 1538, his map projection conveniently making rhumb lines straight. Accurate charting of the coasts of Russia only began in the 18th century, and the archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya was not discovered until 1910.
A compass was first used by the ancient Greeks and Chinese to show where north lies and the direction in which the ship is heading. The latitude (an angle which ranges from 0Â° at the equator to 90Â° at the poles) was determined by measuring the angle between the Sun, Moon or a specific star and the horizon by the use of an astrolabe, Jacob's staff or sextant. The longitude (a line on the globe joining the two poles) could only be calculated with an accurate chronometer to show the exact time difference between the ship and a fixed point such as the Greenwich Meridian. In 1759, John Harrison, a clockmaker, designed such an instrument and James Cook used it in his voyages of exploration. Nowadays, the Global Positioning System (GPS) using over thirty satellites enables accurate navigation worldwide.
In the second century, Ptolemy mapped the whole known world from the "Fortunatae Insulae", Cape Verde or Canary Islands, eastward to the Gulf of Thailand. This map was used in 1492 when Christopher Columbus set out on his voyages. By the eighteenth century better maps had been made and part of the objective of James Cook on his voyages was to further map the ocean. Scientific study has continued with the depth recordings of the "Tuscarora", the oceanic research of the Challenger voyages (1872â1876), the work of the Scandinavian seamen Roald Amundsen and Fridtjof Nansen, the Michael Sars expedition in 1910, the German Meteor expedition of 1925, the Antarctic survey work of "Discovery II" in 1932, and others since. The International Hydrographic Organization, set up in 1921, is the authority on hydrographic surveying and nautical charting.
The International Date Line is an imaginary line on the surface of the Earth, established by the International Meridian Conference in 1884 to demarcate one calendar day from the next. It runs from the north to the south pole roughly following the 180Â° longitude through the middle of the Pacific Ocean but deviating in places to pass around some territories and island groups.
Oceanography and deep sea exploration.
Oceanography is a multidisciplinary science and examines the properties of sea water, studies tides and currents, charts coastlines, maps the seabed and studies marine life. Scientific oceanography began with the voyages of Captain James Cook from 1768 to 1779, describing the Pacific with unprecedented precision from 71 degrees South to 71 degrees North. John Harrison's chronometers supported Cook's accurate navigation and charting on two of these voyages, permanently improving the standard attainable for subsequent work. Other expeditions followed in the nineteenth century, from Russia, France, the Netherlands and the United States as well as Britain. On HMS "Beagle", which provided Charles Darwin with ideas and materials for his 1859 book "On the Origin of Species", the ship's captain, Robert FitzRoy, charted the seas and coasts and published his four-volume report of the ship's three voyages in 1839. Edward Forbes's 1854 book, "Distribution of Marine Life" argued that no life could exist below around 600 metres (2000 feet). This was proven wrong by the British biologists W. B. Carpenter and C. Wyville Thomson, who in 1868 discovered life in deep water by dredging. Wyville Thompson became chief scientist on the Challenger expedition of 1872â1876, which effectively created the science of oceanography.
On her journey round the globe, "HMS Challenger" discovered about 4,700 new marine species, and made 492 deep sea soundings, 133 bottom dredges, 151 open water trawls and 263 serial water temperature observations. In the southern Atlantic in 1898/1899, Carl Chun on the "Valdivia" brought many new life forms to the surface from depths of over . The first observations of deep-sea animals in their natural environment were made in 1930 by William Beebe and Otis Barton who descended to in the spherical steel Bathysphere. This was lowered by cable but by 1960 a self-powered submersible, Trieste developed by Jacques Piccard, took her crew to the deepest part of the Earth's oceans, the Mariana Trench in the Pacific, reaching a record depth of about , a feat not repeated until 2012 when James Cameron piloted the Deepsea Challenger to similar depths. An atmospheric diving suit can be worn for deep sea operations, with a new world record being set in 2006 when a US Navy diver descended to in one of these articulated, pressurized suits.
At great depths, no light penetrates through the water layers from above and the pressure is extreme. For deep sea exploration it is necessary to use specialist vehicles, either remotely operated underwater vehicles with lights and cameras or manned submersibles. The battery-operated Mir submersibles have a three man crew and can descend to 20,000 feet (6,000 m). They have viewing ports, 5,000-watt lights, video equipment and manipulator arms for collecting samples, placing probes or pushing the vehicle across the sea bed when the thrusters would stir up excessive sediment.
Bathymetry is the mapping and study of the topography of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring the depth of the sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries.
Ongoing oceanographic research includes marine lifeforms, conservation, the marine environment, the chemistry of the ocean, the studying and modelling of climate dynamics, the air-sea boundary, weather patterns, ocean resources, renewable energy, waves and currents, and the design and development of new tools and technologies for investigating the deep. Whereas in the 1960s and 1970s research could focus on taxonomy and basic biology, in the 2010s attention has shifted to larger topics such as climate change. Researchers make use of satellite-based remote sensing for surface waters, with research ships, moored observatories and autonomous underwater vehicles to study and monitor all parts of the sea.
Maritime law.
"Freedom of the seas" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: "The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked." Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.
UNCLOS 111 defines various areas of water. "Internal waters" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. "Territorial waters" extend to 12Â nautical miles (22Â kilometres; 14Â miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A "contiguous zone" extending a further 12Â nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An "exclusive economic zone" extends for 200Â nautical miles (370Â kilometres; 230Â miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The "continental shelf" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. Here the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources "attached" to the seabed.
Ships may cross numerous time zones on a voyage, so nautical time, introduced in the 1920s, is used in international waters. Each such zone is uniformly 15 degrees of longitude wide, the ship's clock going forward one hour per zone when travelling eastwards.
Travel.
Sailing ships or packets carried mail overseas, gradually adding cramped passenger accommodation. As early as 1629, the Dutch East India Company was carrying some passengers on the ill-fated "Batavia" from Texel in Holland to Java. Later, scheduled services were offered, but the time journeys took depended much on the weather. When steamships replaced sailing vessels, ocean-going liners took over the task of carrying people. By the beginning of the twentieth century, crossing the Atlantic took about five days and shipping companies competed to own the largest and fastest vessels. The Blue Riband was an unofficial accolade given to the fastest liner crossing the Atlantic in regular service. The "Mauretania" held the title with 26.06 knots (48.26Â km/h) for twenty years from 1909. The Hales Trophy, another award for the fastest commercial crossing of the Atlantic, was won by the "United States" in 1952 for a crossing that took three days, ten hours and forty minutes.
The great liners were comfortable but expensive in fuel and staff. The age of the trans-Atlantic liners waned as cheap intercontinental flights became available. In 1958, a regular scheduled air service between New York and Paris taking seven hours doomed the Atlantic ferry service to oblivion. One by one the vessels were laid up, some were scrapped, others became cruise ships for the leisure industry and still others floating hotels. The sea is still a route by which boat people travel in small, sometimes unseaworthy craft, often having paid money to people smugglers for their passage. Some may be fleeing persecution but most are economic migrants attempting to reach countries where they believe their prospects are brighter.
Trade.
Maritime trade has existed for millennia. The Ptolemaic dynasty had developed trade with India using the Red Sea ports and in the first millennium BC the Arabs, Phoenicians, Israelites and Indians traded in luxury goods such as spices, gold, and precious stones. The Phoenicians were noted sea traders and under the Greeks and Romans, commerce continued to thrive. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, European trade dwindled but it continued to flourish among the kingdoms of Africa, the Middle East, India, China and southeastern Asia. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, about 13Â million people were shipped across the Atlantic to be sold as slaves in the Americas.
Nowadays, large quantities of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim. A major trade route passes through the Pillars of Hercules, across the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and through the Straits of Malacca; much trade also passes through the English Channel. Shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting of Arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the Northwest Passage for some weeks in summertime, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal.
Shipping is supplemented by air freight, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes. Seaborne trade carries more than US $4 trillion worth of goods each year.
There are two main kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities in the form of liquids, powder or particles are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation.
Food.
Coastal countries have an exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from their shores in which they have rights to the marine resources including the fish stocks and may regulate the species, size and total weight of catch permitted. About 87 percent of fish are caught in these zones, but fishing vessels are increasingly venturing further afield to exploit stocks in international waters. In 2011, total world production of fish, including aquaculture, was estimated to be 154Â million tonnes (152M long tons; 170M short tons) of which most was for human consumption. The harvesting of wild fish accounted for 90Â million tonnes (89M long tons; 99M short tons) while annually increasing aquaculture contributes the rest. The north west Pacific is the most productive area while fish catches in most other ocean areas peaked in earlier years. Fish stocks are being fully exploited in some areas and over-exploited in others. Over 3Â million vessels are employed in sea fishing.
Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets and long-lines and the fish species most frequently targeted are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid and salmon. A number of these fisheries have suffered severely due to overexploitation; by 2003, it was estimated that the worldwide population of large predatory fish had been reduced 90%. Many countries have introduced quotas in their own waters.
Artisan fishing methods include rod and line, harpoons, skin diving, traps, throw nets and drag nets. Traditional fishing boats are powered by paddle, wind or outboard motors and operate in near-shore waters. The Food and Agriculture Organization is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.
As well as the wild stock, about 79Â million tonnes (78M long tons; 87M short tons) of food and non-food products were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all time high. About six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed â red, green, and brown algae â are eaten worldwide, and some have long been farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire which is eaten both raw and cooked.
Leisure.
Use of the sea for leisure developed in the nineteenth century, and became a significant industry in the twentieth century. Maritime leisure activities are varied, and include self-organized trips cruising, yachting, powerboat racing and fishing; commercially organized voyages on cruise ships; and trips on smaller vessels for ecotourism such as whale watching and coastal birdwatching.
Humans enjoy venturing into the sea; children paddle and splash in the shallows and many people take pleasure in bathing and relaxing on the beach. This was not always the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after Dr. William Buchan advocated the practice for health reasons. Surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, with or without a surfboard. Other marine water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water, windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, manoeuvrable sail and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull a skier.
Beneath the surface, freediving is necessarily restricted to shallow descents. Pearl divers have traditionally greased their skins, put cotton in their ears and clips on their noses and dived to with baskets in order to collect pearl oysters. Human eyes are not adapted for use underwater, but vision can be improved by wearing a diving mask. Other useful equipment includes fins and snorkels, and scuba equipment allows underwater breathing and hence a longer time can be spent beneath the surface. The depths that can be reached by divers and the length of time they can stay underwater is limited by the increase of pressure they experience as they descend and the need to prevent decompression sickness as they return to the surface. Recreational divers are advised to restrict themselves to depths of under beyond which the danger of nitrogen narcosis increases. Deeper dives can be made with specialised equipment and training.
Power generation.
The sea offers a very large supply of energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity differences, and ocean temperature differences which can be harnessed to generate electricity. Forms of 'green' marine energy include tidal power, marine current power, osmotic power, ocean thermal energy and wave power.
Tidal power uses generators to produce electricity from tidal flows, sometimes by using a dam to store and then release seawater. The Rance barrage, long, near St Malo in Brittany opened in 1967; it generates about 0.5 GW, but it has been followed by few similar schemes.
The large and highly variable energy of waves gives them enormous destructive capability, making affordable and reliable wave machines problematic to develop. A small 2 MW commercial wave power plant, "Osprey", was built in Northern Scotland in 1995 about 300Â metres (1000Â ft) offshore. It was soon damaged by waves, then destroyed by a storm. Marine current power could provide populated areas close to the sea with a significant part of their energy needs. In principle, it could be harnessed by open-flow turbines; sea bed systems are available, but limited to a depth of about .
Offshore wind power is captured by wind turbines placed out at sea; it has the advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land, though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore. The first offshore wind farm was installed in Denmark in 1991, and the installed capacity of European offshore wind farms reached 3 GW in 2010.
Electricity power stations are often located on the coast or beside an estuary so that the sea can be used as a heat sink. A colder heat sink enables more efficient power generation, which is important for expensive nuclear power plants in particular.
Extractive industries.
The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage.
Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s. They form when geothermally heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as "black smokers". The ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.
There are large deposits of petroleum, as oil and natural gas, in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage, and oil may be spilt.
Large quantities of methane clathrate exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around and these are of interest as a potential energy source. Some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5Â million cubic kilometres (0.24 to 1.2Â million cubic miles). Also on the seabed are manganese nodules formed of layers of iron, manganese and other hydroxides around a core. In the Pacific these may cover up to 30 percent of the deep ocean floor. The minerals precipitate from seawater and grow very slowly. Their commercial extraction for nickel was investigated in the 1970s but abandoned in favour of more convenient sources. In suitable locations, diamonds are gathered from the seafloor using suction hoses to bring gravel ashore. In deeper waters, mobile seafloor crawlers are used and the deposits are pumped to a vessel above. In Namibia, more diamonds are now collected from marine sources than by conventional methods on land.
The sea holds enormous quantities of valuable dissolved minerals. The most important, Salt for table and industrial use has been harvested by solar evaporation from shallow ponds since prehistoric times. Bromine, accumulated after being leached from the land, is economically recovered from the Dead Sea, where it occurs at 55,000 parts per million (ppm).
Desalination is the technique of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.
Naval warfare.
Control of the sea is important to the security of a maritime nation, and the naval blockade of a port can be used to cut off food and supplies in time of war. Battles have been fought on the sea for more than 3,000 years. In about 1210 B.C., the king of the Hittites defeated and burned a fleet from Cyprus. In the decisive 480 B.C. Battle of Salamis, the Greek general Themistocles trapped the far larger fleet of the Persian king Xerxes in a narrow channel and attacked vigorously, destroying 200 Persian ships for the loss of 40 Greek vessels. At the end of the Age of Sail, the English navy, led by Horatio Nelson, broke the power of the combined French and Spanish fleets at the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar.
With steam and the industrial production of steel plate came greatly increased firepower in the shape of the dreadnought battleships armed with long-range guns. In 1905, the Japanese fleet decisively defeated the Russian fleet, which had travelled over , at the Battle of Tsushima. Dreadnoughts fought inconclusively in the First World War at the 1916 Battle of Jutland between the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet and the Imperial German Navy's High Seas Fleet. In the Second World War, the British victory at the 1940 Battle of Taranto showed that naval air power was sufficient to overcome the largest warships, foreshadowing the decisive sea-battles of the Pacific War including the Battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, the Philippine Sea, and the climactic Battle of Leyte Gulf, in all of which the dominant ships were aircraft carriers.
Submarines became important in naval warfare in World War I, when German submarines, known as U-boats, sank nearly 5,000 Allied merchant ships, including the RMS Lusitania, so helping to bring the United States into the war. In World War II, almost 3,000 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats attempting to block the flow of supplies to Britain, but the Allies broke the blockade in the Battle of the Atlantic, which lasted the whole length of the war, sinking 783 U-boats. Since 1960, several nations have maintained fleets of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, vessels equipped to launch ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads from under the sea. Some of these are kept permanently on patrol.
Marine pollution.
Many substances enter the sea as a result of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited into the sea by precipitation. Industrial outflows and sewage contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, household cleaning products and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium and zinc which may be bio-accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are cumulative toxins and are passed up the food chain.
Much floating plastic rubbish does not biodegrade, instead disintegrating over time and eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In the centre of the Pacific gyre there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food, and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.
Most oil pollution in the sea comes from cities and industry. Oil is dangerous for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, and be ingested when they preen themselves in an attempt to remove the contaminant. Marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated or poisoned. Benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected and the livelihoods of people dependant on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume spilt oil.
Run-off of fertilisers from agricultural land is a major source of pollution in some areas and the discharge of raw sewage has a similar effect. The extra nutrients provided by these sources can cause excessive plant growth. Nitrogen is often the limiting factor in marine systems, and with added nitrogen, algal blooms and red tides can lower the oxygen level of the water and kill marine animals. Such events have created dead zones in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Some algal blooms are caused by cyanobacteria that make shellfish that filter feed on them toxic, harming animals like sea otters. Nuclear facilities too can pollute. The Irish Sea was contaminated by radioactive caesium-137 from the former Sellafield nuclear fuel processing plant and nuclear accidents may also cause radioactive material to seep into the sea, as did the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011.
The dumping of waste (including oil, noxious liquids, sewage and garbage) at sea is governed by international law. The London Convention (1972) is a United Nations agreement to control ocean dumping which had been ratified by 89 countries by 8 June 2012. MARPOL 73/78 is a convention to minimize pollution of the seas by ships. By May 2013, 152 maritime nations had ratified MARPOL.
Indigenous sea peoples.
Several nomadic indigenous groups in Maritime Southeast Asia live in boats and derive nearly all they need from the sea. The Moken people live on the coasts of Thailand and Burma and islands in the Andaman Sea. The Bajau people are originally from the Sulu Archipelago, Mindanao and northern Borneo. Some Sea Gypsies are accomplished free-divers, able to descend to depths of , though many are adopting a more settled, land-based way of life.
The indigenous peoples of the Arctic such as the Chukchi, Inuit, Inuvialuit and Yup'iit hunt marine mammals including seals and whales, and the Torres Strait Islanders of Australia include ownership of the Great Barrier Reef among their possessions. They live a traditional life on the islands involving hunting, fishing, gardening and trading with neighbouring peoples in Papua and mainland Aboriginal Australians.
In culture.
The sea appears in human culture in contradictory ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous. It has its place in literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, classical music, mythology and dream interpretation. The Ancients personified it, believing it to be under the control of a being who needed to be appeased, and symbolically, it has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures; the Leviathan of the Bible, Scylla in Greek mythology, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. Civilizations have advanced through maritime trade and the exchange of ideas.
The sea and ships have been depicted in art ranging from simple drawings on the walls of huts in Lamu, Kenya, to seascapes by Joseph Turner. In Dutch Golden Age painting, artists such as Jan Porcellis, Hendrick Dubbels, Willem van de Velde the Elder and his son, and Ludolf Bakhuizen celebrated the sea and the Dutch navy at the peak of its military prowess. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including "The Great Wave off Kanagawa".
Music too has been inspired by the ocean, sometimes by composers who lived or worked near the shore and saw its many different aspects. Sea shanties, songs that were chanted by mariners to help them perform arduous tasks, have been woven into compositions and impressions in music have been created of calm waters, crashing waves and storms at sea. Classical sea-related music includes Richard Wagner's "The Flying Dutchman", Claude Debussy's "La mer" (1903â05), Charles Villiers Stanford's "Songs of the Sea" (1904) and "Songs of the Fleet" (1910), Edward Elgar's "Sea Pictures" (1899) and Ralph Vaughan Williams' "A Sea Symphony" (1903â1909).
As a symbol, the sea has for centuries played a role in literature, poetry and dreams. Sometimes it is there just as a gentle background but often it introduces such themes as storm, shipwreck, battle, hardship, disaster, the dashing of hopes and death. In his epic poem the "Odyssey", written in the 8th century BC, Homer describes the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero Odysseus who struggles to return home across the sea's many hazards after the war described in the "Iliad". The sea is a recurring theme in the Haiku poems of the Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo BashÅ (æ¾å°¾ è­è) (1644â1694). In modern literature, sea-inspired novels have been written by Joseph Conrad â drawn from his experience at sea, Herman Wouk, and Herman Melville. In the works of psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolizes the personal and the collective unconscious in dream interpretation, the depths of the sea symbolizing the depths of the unconscious mind. Although the origin of life on Earth is still a matter of debate, scientist and writer Rachel Carson, in her award-winning 1951 book "The Sea Around Us", wrote, "It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose, should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist: the threat is rather to life itself".

Why Baby Why

"Why Baby Why" is the title of a country music song co-written and originally recorded by George Jones. Released in late 1955 on Starday Records, and produced by Starday co-founder and Jones manager Pappy Daily, it peaked at 4 on the "Billboard" country charts that year. It was Jones' first chart single, following several unsuccessful singles released during the prior year on Starday. 
Themes and recording.
The lyric sets up the theme of the song:
The arrangement is upbeat honky tonk, led by a fiddle that plays throughout the song. Overall, the song has been described as a classic of the "finger-pointin' cheatin' song".
The recording session for "Why Baby Why" took place in Houston, Texas's Gold Star Studios and featured the house lineup of Glenn Barber on lead guitar, Herb Remington on pedal steel guitar, Tony Sepolio on fiddle, and Doc Lewis on piano. Jones recorded the backing vocal himself, with help from innovative techniques from engineer Bill Quinn, after a planned appearance by more established singer Sonny Burns did not materialize due to the latter's drinking. Jones himself was drinking throughout the prolonged session, sometimes forgetting chords or words; Sepolio resolved afterward never to work with Jones again.
Reception.
The single's early airplay occurred in Jones' home state of Texas, with Houston's country music station KIKK ranking it number one locally. Their charts were sent to stations around the country, which began to pick it up as well, partially overcoming Starday's regionally-limited distribution. However, its progress on the chart was blunted by Red Sovine and Webb Pierce's cover duet, which benefited from Decca Records' major label status and national distribution and rose to number one on the chart over the 1955â1956 Christmas holiday period. Jones's rendition was later included as the first track on his 1957 debut album "Grand Ole Opry's New Star".
Covers.
Since the release of Jones' rendition, "Why Baby Why" has been covered by several other artists, many of whom have charted with it as well. Jones himself re-recorded it in 1994 as a duet with Ricky Skaggs for the album "The Bradley Barn Sessions", an album which featured re-recordings of Jones's songs as duets.
Two different versions of the song have reached Number One on the country charts, making it one of the only country songs to hold that distinction. Artists who have had country chart hits with renditions of this song include the following:

Ocean

An ocean (; the World Ocean of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere, occupying more than two-thirds of Earth's surface. On Earth, an ocean is one or all of the major divisions of the planet's World Ocean â which are, in descending order of area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word "sea" is often used interchangeably with "ocean" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the World Ocean) that land partly or fully encloses.
Earth is the only planet that is known to have an ocean (or any large amounts of open liquid water). Saline water covers approximately 72% of the planet's surface (~3.6x108Â km2) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of the Earth's surface. The ocean contains 97% of the Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that only 5% of the World Ocean has been explored. The total volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres (310 million cu mi) with an average depth of .
The ocean principally comprises Earth's hydrosphere and therefore is integral to all known life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. It is the habitat of 230,000 known species, although much of the ocean's depths remain unexplored, and over two million marine species are estimated to exist. The origin of Earth's oceans remains unknown; oceans are believed to have formed in the Hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life.
Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds. The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan, although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System. Early in their geologic histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point, so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of Europa is believed to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's gas giant planets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone. Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.
Earth's global ocean.
Divisions.
Though generally described as several separate oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water sometimes referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean. This concept of a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.
The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria. See the table below for more information; note that the table is in descending order in terms of size.
The Pacific and Atlantic may be further subdivided by the equator into northern and southern portions. A smaller region of the ocean can be called other names, such as sea, gulf, bay, and strait.
Physical properties.
The total mass of the hydrosphere is about or 1.4Ã1021 kg, which is about 0.023 percent of the Earth's total mass. Less than 3 percent is freshwater; the rest is saltwater, mostly in the ocean. The area of the World Ocean is 361 million square kilometres (139 million square miles), and its volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres (310 million cu mi). This can be thought of as a cube of water with an edge length of . Its average depth is , and its maximum depth is . Nearly half of the world's marine waters are over deep. The vast expanses of deep ocean (anything below ) cover about 66% of the Earth's surface. This does not include seas not connected to the World Ocean, such as the Caspian Sea.
The bluish color of water is a composite of several contributing agents. Prominent contributors include dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll.
Sailors and other mariners have reported that the ocean often emits a visible glow, or luminescence, which extends for miles at night. In 2005, scientists announced that for the first time, they had obtained photographic evidence of this glow. It is most likely caused by bioluminescence.
Zones and depths.
Oceanographers divide the ocean into different zones by physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone includes all open ocean and comprises further regions of depth and light abundance. The photic zone falls two-hundred meters below the oceanic surface and is where photosynthesis can occur and therefore the most biodiverse. Plants require photosynthesis: deeper life relies on material sinking from above (see marine snow) or another energy source. Hydrothermal vents are the primary source in what is known as the aphotic zone (depths exceeding 200Â m). The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the epipelagic.
The pelagic part of the aphotic zone comprises regions that descend in vertical order according to temperature.
The mesopelagic is the uppermost region. Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of , which, in the tropics generally lies at . Next is the bathypelagic lying between , typically between and Lying along the top of the abyssal plain is the abyssopelagic, whose lower boundary lies at about . The last zone includes the deep oceanic trench, and is known as the hadalpelagic. This lies between and is the deepest oceanic zone.
The benthic zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the deep-sea. The bathyal zone covers the continental slope down to about . The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000Â m. Lastly, the hadal zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.
The pelagic zone comprises two subregions: the neritic zone and the oceanic zone. The neritic encompasses the water mass directly above the continental shelves whereas the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water.
Whereas the littoral zone covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the intertidal zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region.
The ocean can be divided into three density zones: the surface zone, the pycnocline, and the deep zone. The surface zone, also called the mixed layer, refers to the uppermost density zone of the ocean. Temperature and salinity are relatively constant with depth in this zone due to currents and wave action. The surface zone contains ocean water that is in contact with the atmosphere and within the photic zone. The surface zone has the ocean's least dense water and represents approximately 2% of the total volume of ocean water. The surface zone usually ranges between depths of 500 feet to 3,300 feet below ocean surface, but this can vary a great deal. In some cases, the surface zone can be entirely non-existent. The surface zone is typically thicker in the tropics than in regions of higher latitude. The transition to colder, denser water is more abrupt in the tropics than in regions of higher latitudes. The pycnocline refers to a zone wherein density substantially increases with depth due primarily to decreases in temperature. The pycnocline effectively separates the lower-density surface zone above from the higher-density deep zone below. The pycnocline represents approximately 18% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone refers to the lowermost density zone of the ocean. The deep zone usually begins at depths below 3,300 feet in mid-latitudes. The deep zone undergoes negligible changes in water density with depth. The deep zone represents approximately 80% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone contains relatively colder and stable water.
If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline since surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from -1Â°C to 3Â°C. Since this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9Â°C
If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth, it contains a halocline. If a zone undergoes a strong, vertical chemistry gradient with depth, it contains a chemocline.
The halocline often coincides with the thermocline, and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline.
Exploration.
Ocean travel by boat dates back to prehistoric times, but only in modern times has extensive underwater travel become possible.
The deepest point in the ocean is the Mariana Trench, located in the Pacific Ocean near the Northern Mariana Islands. Its maximum depth has been estimated to be (plus or minus 11 meters; see the Mariana Trench article for discussion of the various estimates of the maximum depth.) The British naval vessel, "Challenger II" surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench, the "Challenger Deep". In 1960, the Trieste successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.
Much of the ocean bottom remains unexplored and unmapped. A global image of many underwater features larger than was created in 1995 based on gravitational distortions of the nearby sea surface.
Climate.
Ocean currents greatly affect the Earth's climate by transferring heat from the tropics to the polar regions. Transferring warm or cold air and precipitation to coastal regions, where winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater fluxes create global density gradients that drive the thermohaline circulation part of large-scale ocean circulation. It plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on the Earth's radiation budget. In so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.
For a discussion of the possibilities of changes to the thermohaline circulation under global warming, see shutdown of thermohaline circulation.
It is often stated that the thermohaline circulation is the primary reason that the climate of Western Europe is so temperate. An alternate hypothesis claims that this is largely incorrect, and that Europe is warm mostly because it lies downwind of an ocean basin, and because atmospheric waves bring warm air north from the subtropics.
The Antarctic Circumpolar Current encircles that continent, influencing the area's climate and connecting currents in several oceans.
One of the most dramatic forms of weather occurs over the oceans: tropical cyclones (also called "typhoons" and "hurricanes" depending upon where the system forms).
Biology.
The ocean has a significant effect on the biosphere. Oceanic evaporation, as a phase of the water cycle, is the source of most rainfall, and ocean temperatures determine climate and wind patterns that affect life on land. Life within the ocean evolved 3 billion years prior to life on land. Both the depth and the distance from shore strongly influence the biodiversity of the plants and animals present in each region.
Lifeforms native to the ocean include:
Mixing Time.
Residence Time = The amount of the element in the ocean Ã· The rate at which that element is added to (or removed from) the ocean
The mean oceanic mixing time (residence time) is thought to be approximately 1,600 years. If a given element in the ocean stays in the ocean, on average, longer than the oceanic mixing time, then that element is assumed to be homogeneously spread throughout the ocean. As a result, since the major salts have a residence time that is longer than 1,600 years, the ratio of major salts is thought to be unchanging across the ocean. This constant ratio is often referred to as Forchhammer's principle or the principle of constant proportions. 
Salinity.
A zone of rapid salinity increase with depth is called a halocline. The temperature of maximum density of seawater decreases as its salt content increases. Freezing temperature of water decreases with salinity, and boiling temperature of water increases with salinity. Typical seawater freezes at around -1.9Â°C at atmospheric pressure. If precipitation exceeds evaporation, as is the case in polar and temperate regions, salinity will be lower. If evaporation exceeds precipitation, as is the case in tropical regions, salinity will be higher. Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions. 
Salinity can be calculated using the chlorinity, which is a measure of the total mass of halogen ions (includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in seawater. By international agreement, the following formula is used to determine salinity: 
Salinity (in â°) = 1.80655 x Chlorinity (in â°)
The average chlorinity is about 19.2â°, and, thus, the average salinity is around 34.7â° 
Economic value.
The oceans are essential to transportation. This is because most of the world's goods move by ship between the world's seaports. Oceans are also the major supply source for the fishing industry. Some of the more major ones are shrimp, fish, crabs, and lobster.
Extraterrestrial oceans.
While Earth is the only known planet with large stable bodies of liquid water on its surface and the only one in our Solar System, other celestial bodies are believed to possess large oceans.
Planets.
The gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are thought to lack surfaces and instead have a stratum of liquid hydrogen, however their planetary geology is not well understood. The possibility of Uranus and Neptune possessing hot, highly compressed, supercritical water under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised. While their composition is still not fully understood, a 2006 study by Wiktorowicz et al. ruled out the possibility of such a water "ocean" existing on Neptune, though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid diamond are possible.
The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic. The possibility continues to be studied along with reasons for their apparent disappearance. Astronomers believe that Venus had liquid water and perhaps oceans in its very early history. If they existed, all later vanished via resurfacing.
Natural satellites.
A global layer of liquid water thick enough to decouple the crust from the mantle is believed to be present on Titan, Europa and, with less certainty, Callisto, Ganymede and Triton. A magma ocean is thought to be present on Io. Geysers have been found on Saturn's moon Enceladus, though their origins are not well understood. Other icy moons may also have internal oceans, or have once had internal oceans that have now frozen.
Large bodies of liquid hydrocarbons are thought to be present on the surface of Titan, though they are not large enough to be described as oceans and are sometimes referred to as "lakes" or seas. The CassiniâHuygens space mission initially discovered only what appeared to be dry lakebeds and empty river channels, suggesting that Titan had lost what surface liquids it might have had. Cassini's more recent fly-by of Titan offers radar images that strongly suggest hydrocarbon lakes exist near the colder polar regions. Titan is thought to have a subterranean water ocean under the ice and hydrocarbon mix that forms its outer crust.
Dwarf planets and trans-Neptunian objects.
Ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle and may harbour a liquid-water ocean under its surface.
Not enough is known of the larger Trans-Neptunian objects to determine whether they are differentiated bodies capable of possessing oceans, although models of radioactive decay suggest that Pluto, Eris, Sedna, and Orcus have oceans beneath solid icy crusts at the core-boundary approximately thick.
Extrasolar.
Some planets and natural satellites beyond the Solar System are likely to possess oceans, including possible water ocean planets similar to Earth in the habitable zone or "liquid-water belt". The detection of oceans, even through the spectroscopy method, however is likely to prove extremely difficult and inconclusive.
Theoretical models have been used to predict with high probability that GJ 1214 b, detected by transit, is composed of exotic form of ice VII, making up 75% of its mass.
Other possible candidates are merely speculated based on their mass and position in the habitable zone include planet though little is actually known of their composition. Some scientists speculate Kepler-22b may be an "ocean-like" planet. Models have been proposed for Gliese 581 d that could include surface oceans. Gliese 436 b is speculated to have an ocean of "hot ice". Extrasolar moons orbiting planets, particularly gas giants within their parent star's habitable zone may theoretically possess surface oceans.

Karl-Friedrich Brill

Dr.-Ing. Karl-Friedrich Wilhelm Anton August Brill (18 July 1898 â 22 October 1943) was a "FregattenkapitÃ¤n " of the Reserves with the Kriegsmarine during World War II and member of the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt in the aftermaths of World War I. He is also a posthumous recipient of the coveted Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
Brill was killed in action when the Minenschiff "Juminda" was sunk on 22 October 1943 west of Porto Santo Stefano by three American torpedo boats from the 15th Squadron MTB coming from the base of La Maddalena. PT 212, PT 206, PT 216 launched several torpedoes but only the PT 212 scored 2 hits at the stern of the vessel.
More than 60 German sailors were killed in this enagegement, while only sixteen of them were saved. The body of Karl-Friedrich Brill was found in the sea two days later and buried with military honors on 27 October 1943 at the cemetery of Orbetello and then transferred to the German cemetery at Pomezia.

Jiangnan DaYing ( or the Army Group Jiangnan; (firstï¼ 1853 - 1856 and secondï¼ 1857 - 1860) was an army group in China. The Qing government raised the Green Standard Army to quell the Taiping Rebellion. Qing twice surrounded Nanjing (the capital of the Taiping Rebellion) and lost at last.
First Jiangnan DaYing.
Time.
1853â1856: when the armies of the Taiping Rebellion occupied Nanjing, after 10 days Xiang Rong in command of a 10,000 strong Green Standard Army tracked them to Taiping and stationed outside the Nanjing wall.
Headquarters.
The headquarters of the Jiangnan DaYing were located in Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.

Strength.
The 80,000 soldiers in the regular Army faced 460,000+ in the Taiping Rebellion militia force.
Outcome.
On June 1, 1856, an army tried to stop the Taiping forces but the Governor of Jiangsu Jeer Hungar (åç¾æ­é¿), Mayor of Nanjing, lost and his army of 7,800 were all killed. 
There was a heated battle from June 16 to June 20, but the Qing army of 80,000 was defeated and the surviving 36,000 followers of Xiang Rong retreated north. On August 9, Xiang Rong committed suicide in Danyang, but this strategy stopped the forces' march north.

Strength.
The regular Army had only 180,000 soldiers while the Taiping Rebellion militia force had at least 560,000 soldiers.
Outcome.
Taiping Rebellion forces occupied Jiangsu in 1860. The next year, they occupied Zhejiang. The Jiangnan DaYing was destroyed. The Second Opium War took place and the Xianfeng Emperor died in 1861. The Xiang Army and Huai Army combined to become the Green Standard Army in 1862 and for the third time they surrounded and attacked Nanjing, successfully ending the civil war in July 1864.
Commentary.
The Jiangnan DaYing had trouble making payroll for its forces, and these forces were insufficient to fight off the British and French forces in northern China. 
The leaders intrigued against each otherï¼ Xiang Rong (åæ¦®)ãand Her Chyun in the first Jiangnan DaYing Her Chyun group, and the He Guiqing and Zeng Guofan groups disputed inner officials' system, which allowed the Taiping Rebellion to gain momentum.
Her Chyun could use the Brigadier General's works but he belittled the Taiping Rebellion, He Guiqing's cowardice and Zeng Guofan's selfishness, which were the three reasons for their loss.

Project 119

Project 119 is a governmental program of the People's Republic of China targeting sports that China has not traditionally excelled in at the Summer Olympics, to maximize the amount of total medals and number of golds won during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The number, "119", refers to the number of gold medals available in events that China is targeting. The total number of golds available in the targeted sports was 122 at the targeted 2008 Olympics, an increase of three.
"Project 119" is related to the Plan for Olympic Glory, a more general plan for greater performance across the board.
History.
With the awarding of the Games of the XXIX Olympiad of 2008 to Beijing in 2001, the government of China embarked on a program to increase its medal load. Project 119 was established to gain medals in the sports of Track and Field, Swimming, Rowing & Canoe/Kayak and Sailing. These sports had a total gold medal count of 119 in the 2000 Summer Olympics. At those Games, China had only won one medal in all these sports. China wished to finish on top of the medal count and gold medal total at its own games. 
For rowing, China established a training centre at Thousand Island Lake, 500Â km from Shanghai, and hired foreign coaches from around the world.
Development.
Leading up the 2008 target, China harvested several fruits for their labours.
Target.
Project 119 failed to live up to billing in the swimming events, resulting in only one gold medal. 
Entering with a powerful team in rowing, Project 119 resulted in a single gold medal for the women's quad. The men's eight failed to advance.
Legacy.
The Beijing Olympics ended with China winning the most golds, while finishing second to the United States in total medals. This marked the first time since the 1936 Summer Olympics that neither the United States, nor the Soviet Union/Russia, had won the most gold medals at a Summer Olympics.
China performed well at the London 2012 Games, winning the second largest amount of gold medals and in total medal count.

River

A river is a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea, or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely at the end of its course, and does not reach another body of water. Small rivers may be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for generic terms, such as river, as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream may be defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are "run" in the United States, "burn" in Scotland and northeast England, and "beck" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.
Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle. Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g. from glaciers). is the scientific study of rivers while limnology is the study of inland waters in general.
No extraterrestrial rivers are currently known, though large flows of hydrocarbons described as rivers have recently been found on Titan. Channels may indicate past rivers on other planets, specifically outflow channels on Mars and are theorised to exist on planets and moons in habitable zones of stars. The world's longest river is the Nile.
Topography.
A river begins at a source (or more often several sources) and ends at a mouth, following a path called a course. The water in a river is usually confined to a channel, made up of a stream bed between banks. In larger rivers there is also a wider floodplain shaped by flood-waters over-topping the channel. Floodplains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. This distinction between river channel and floodplain can be blurred, especially in urban areas where the floodplain of a river channel can become greatly developed by housing and industry.
Rivers can flow down mountains, through valleys (depressions) or along plains, and can create canyons or gorges.
The term upriver (or upstream) refers to the direction towards the source of the river, i.e. against the direction of flow. Likewise, the term downriver (or downstream) describes the direction towards the mouth of the river, in which the current flows.
The river channel typically contains a single stream of water, but some rivers flow as several interconnecting streams of water, producing a braided river. Extensive braided rivers are now found in only a few regions worldwide, such as the South Island of New Zealand. They also occur on peneplains and some of the larger river deltas. Anastamosing rivers are similar to braided rivers and are also quite rare. They have multiple sinuous channels carrying large volumes of sediment. There are only two cases in the world of rivers dividing and the resultant flows ending in different seas: one of these is the Bifurcation of Nerodime river in Kosovo. 
A river flowing in its channel is a source of energy which acts on the river channel to change its shape and form. In 1757, the German hydrologist Albert Brahms empirically observed that the submerged weight of objects that may be carried away by a river is proportional to the sixth power of the river flow speed. This formulation is also sometimes called Airy's law. Thus, if the speed of flow is doubled, the flow would dislodge objects with 64 times as much submerged weight. In mountainous torrential zones this can be seen as erosion channels through hard rocks and the creation of sands and gravels from the destruction of larger rocks. In U-shaped glaciated valleys, the subsequent river valley can often easily be identified by the V-shaped channel that it has carved. In the middle reaches where a river flows over flatter land, meanders may form through erosion of the river banks and deposition on the inside of bends. Sometimes the river will cut off a loop, shortening the channel and forming an oxbow lake or billabong. Rivers that carry large amounts of sediment may develop conspicuous deltas at their mouths. Rivers whose mouths are in saline tidal waters may form estuaries.
Throughout the course of the river, the total volume of water transported downstream will often be a combination of the free water flow together with a substantial volume flowing through sub-surface rocks and gravels that underlie the river and its floodplain (called the hyporheic zone). For many rivers in large valleys, this unseen component of flow may greatly exceed the visible flow.
Subsurface streams.
Most but not all rivers flow on the surface. Subterranean rivers flow underground in caves or caverns. Such rivers are frequently found in regions with limestone geologic formations. Subglacial streams are the braided rivers that flow at the beds of glaciers and ice sheets, permitting meltwater to be discharged at the front of the glacier. Because of the gradient in pressure due to the overlying weight of the glacier, such streams can even flow uphill.
Permanence of flow.
An "intermittent river" (or ephemeral river) only flows occasionally and can be dry for several years at a time. These rivers are found in regions with limited or highly variable rainfall, or can occur because of geologic conditions such as a highly permeable river bed. Some ephemeral rivers flow during the summer months but not in the winter. Such rivers are typically fed from chalk aquifers which recharge from winter rainfall. In England these rivers are called "bournes" and give their name to places such as Bournemouth and Eastbourne.
Classification.
Rivers have been classified by many criteria including their topography, their biotic status, their relevance to white water rafting or canoeing activities.
Topographical classification.
Rivers can generally be classified as either alluvial, bedrock, or some mix of the two. Alluvial rivers have channels and floodplains that are self-formed in unconsolidated or weakly consolidated sediments. They erode their banks and deposit material on bars and their floodplains. Bedrock rivers form when the river downcuts through the modern sediments and into the underlying bedrock. This occurs in regions that have experienced some kind of uplift (thereby steepening river gradients) or in which a particular hard lithology causes a river to have a steepened reach that has not been covered in modern alluvium. Bedrock rivers very often contain alluvium on their beds; this material is important in eroding and sculpting the channel. Rivers that go through patches of bedrock and patches of deep alluvial cover are classified as mixed bedrock-alluvial.
Alluvial rivers can be further classified by their channel pattern as meandering, braided, wandering, anastomose, or straight. The morphology of an alluvial river reach is controlled by a combination of sediment supply, substrate composition, discharge, vegetation, and bed aggradation.
At the turn of the 20th century William Morris Davis devised the "cycle of erosion" method of classifying rivers based on their "age". Although Davis's system is still found in many books today, after the 1950s and 1960s it became increasingly criticized and rejected by geomorphologists. His scheme did not produce testable hypotheses and was therefore deemed non-scientific. Examples of Davis's river "ages" include:
The way in which a river's characteristics vary between the upper course and lower course of a river are summarized by the Bradshaw model. Power-law relationships between channel slope, depth, and width are given as a function of discharge by "river regime".
Biotic classification.
There are very many systems of classification based on biotic conditions typically assigning classes from the most oligotrophic or unpolluted through to the most eutrophic or polluted. Other systems are based on a whole eco-system approach such as developed by the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment.
In Europe, the requirements of the Water Framework Directive has led to the development of a wide range of classification methods including classifications based on fishery status
A system of river zonation used in francophone communities divides rivers into three primary zones:
Whitewater classification.
The International Scale of River Difficulty is used to rate the challenges of navigationâparticularly those with rapids. Class I is the easiest and Class VI is the hardest.
Stream order classification.
The Strahler Stream Order ranks rivers based on the connectivity and hierarchy of contributing tributaries. Headwaters are first order while the Amazon River is twelfth order. Approximately 80% of the rivers and streams in the world are of the first and second order.
Uses.
Rivers have been used as a source of water, for obtaining food, for transport, as a defensive measure, as a source of hydropower to drive machinery, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste.
Rivers have been used for navigation for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of navigation is found in the Indus Valley Civilization, which existed in northwestern Pakistan around 3300 BC. Riverine navigation provides a cheap means of transport, and is still used extensively on most major rivers of the world like the Amazon, the Ganges, the Nile, the Mississippi, and the Indus. Since river boats are often not regulated, they contribute a large amount to global greenhouse gas emissions, and to local cancer due to inhaling of particulates emitted by the transports.
In some heavily forested regions such as Scandinavia and Canada, lumberjacks use the river to float felled trees downstream to lumber camps for further processing, saving much effort and cost by transporting the huge heavy logs by natural means.
Rivers have been a source of food since pre-history. They can provide a rich source of fish and other edible aquatic life, and are a major source of fresh water, which can be used for drinking and irrigation. It is therefore no surprise to find most of the major cities of the world situated on the banks of rivers. Rivers help to determine the urban form of cities and neighbourhoods and their corridors often present opportunities for urban renewal through the development of foreshoreways such as riverwalks. Rivers also provide an easy means of disposing of waste-water and, in much of the less developed world, other wastes.
Fast flowing rivers and waterfalls are widely used as sources of energy, via watermills and hydroelectric plants. Evidence of watermills shows them in use for many hundreds of years such as in Orkney at Dounby Click Mill. Prior to the invention of steam power, water-mills for grinding cereals and for processing wool and other textiles were common across Europe. In the 1890s the first machines to generate power from river water were established at places such as Cragside in Northumberland and in recent decades there has been a significant increase in the development of large scale power generation from water, especially in wet mountainous regions such as Norway.
The coarse sediments, gravel, and sand, generated and moved by rivers are extensively used in construction. In parts of the world this can generate extensive new lake habitats as gravel pits re-fill with water. In other circumstances it can destabilise the river bed and the course of the river and cause severe damage to spawning fish populations which rely on stable gravel formations for egg laying.
In upland rivers, rapids with whitewater or even waterfalls occur. Rapids are often used for recreation, such as whitewater kayaking.
Rivers have been important in determining political boundaries and defending countries. For example, the Danube was a long-standing border of the Roman Empire, and today it forms most of the border between Bulgaria and Romania. The Mississippi in North America and the Rhine in Europe are major east-west boundaries in those continents. The Orange and Limpopo Rivers in southern Africa form the boundaries between provinces and countries along their routes.
Ecosystem.
The organisms in the riparian zone respond to changes in river channel location and patterns of flow. The ecosystem of rivers is generally described by the River continuum concept, which has some additions and refinements to allow for spatial (dams, waterfalls) and temporal (extensive flooding). The basic idea is that the river can be described as a system that is continuously changing along its length in the physical parameters, the availability of food particles and the composition of the ecosystem. The food (energy) that is the leftover of the upstream part is being utilized downstream.
The general pattern is that the first order streams contain particulate matter (decaying leaves from the surrounding forests), which is processed there by shredders like Plecoptera larvae. The leftovers of the shredders are utilized by collectors, such as Hydropsychidae, and further downstream algae that create the primary production become the main foodsource of the organisms. All changes are gradual and the distribution of each species can be described as a normal curve with the highest density where the conditions are optimal. In rivers succession is virtually absent and the composition of the ecosystem stays fixed in time.
Chemistry.
The chemistry of rivers is complex and depends on inputs from the atmosphere, the geology through which it travels and the inputs from man's activities. The chemistry of the water has a large impact on the ecology of that water for both plants and animals and it also affects the uses that may be made of the river water. Understanding and characterising river water chemistry requires a well designed and managed sampling and analysis.
Like many other Aquatic ecosystems, rivers too are under increasing threat of pollution. According to a study of the WWF's Global Freshwater Programme, the 10 most polluted rivers are: Ganges, Indus, Yangtze, Salween-Nu, Mekong-Lancang, Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, RÃ­o de la Plata, Danube, Nile-Lake Victoria, and the Murray-Darling.
Brackish water.
Some rivers generate brackish water by having their river mouth in the ocean. This, in effect creates a unique environment in which certain species are found.
Flooding.
Flooding is a natural part of a river's cycle. The majority of the erosion of river channels and the erosion and deposition on the associated floodplains occur during flood stage. In many developed areas, human activity has changed river channel form, altering different magnitudes and frequencies of flooding. Some examples of this are the building of levees, the straightening of channels, and the draining of natural wetlands. In many cases human activities in rivers and floodplains have dramatically increased the risk of flooding. Straightening rivers allows water to flow more rapidly downstream increasing the risk of flooding places further downstream. Building on flood plains removes flood storage which again exacerbates downstream flooding. The building of levees may only protect the area behind the levees and not those further downstream. Levees and flood-banks can also increase flooding upstream because of the back-water pressure as the upstream flow is impeded by the narrow channel banks.
Flow.
Studying the flows of rivers is one aspect of hydrology.
Direction.
Rivers flow downhill with their power derived from gravity. The direction can involve all directions of the compass and can be a complex meandering path.
Rivers flowing downhill, from river source to river mouth, do not necessarily take the shortest path. For alluvial streams, straight and braided rivers have very low sinuosity and flow directly down hill, while meandering rivers flow from side to side across a valley. Bedrock rivers typically flow in either a fractal pattern, or a pattern that is determined by weaknesses in the bedrock, such as faults, fractures, or more erodible layers.
Rate.
Volumetric flow rate, also known as discharge, volume flow rate, and rate of water flow, is the volume of water which passes through a given cross-section of the river channel per unit time. It is typically measured in cubic metres per second (cumec) or cubic feet per second (cfs), where 1Â m3/s = 35.51Â ft3/s; it is sometimes also measured in litres or gallons per second.
Volumetric flow rate can be thought of as the mean velocity of the flow through a given cross-section, times that cross-sectional area. Mean velocity can be approximated through the use of the Law of the Wall. In general, velocity increases with the depth (or hydraulic radius) and slope of the river channel, while the cross-sectional area scales with the depth and the width: the double-counting of depth shows the importance of this variable in determining the discharge through the channel.
Sediment yield.
Sediment yield is the total quantity of particulate matter (suspended or bedload) reaching the outlet of a drainage basin over a fixed time frame. Yield is usually expressed as kilograms per square kilometre per year. Sediment delivery processes are affected by a myriad of factors such as drainage area size, basin slope, climate, sediment type (lithology), vegetation cover, and human land use / management practices. The theoretical concept of the 'sediment delivery ratio' (ratio between yield and total amount of sediment eroded) captures the fact that not all of the sediment eroded within a catchment reaches the outlet (due to, for example, deposition on floodplains). Such storage opportunities are typically increased in catchments of larger size, thus leading to a lower yield and sediment delivery ratio.
Management.
Rivers are often managed or controlled to make them more useful, or less disruptive, to human activity.
River management is a continuous activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by people. Dredged channels silt up, sluice mechanisms deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. The benefits sought through managing rivers may often be offset by the social and economic costs of mitigating the bad effects of such management. As an example, in parts of the developed world, rivers have been confined within channels to free up flat flood-plain land for development. Floods can inundate such development at high financial cost and often with loss of life.
Rivers are increasingly managed for habitat conservation, as they are critical for many aquatic and riparian plants, resident and migratory fishes, waterfowl, birds of prey, migrating birds, and many mammals.

Lake

A lake is a body of relatively still liquid (prototypically water) of considerable size, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land apart from a river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. However most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.
Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, or for aesthetic or recreational purposes.
Etymology, meaning, and usage of "lake".
The word "lake" comes from Middle English "lake" ("lake, pond, waterway"), from Old English "lacu" ("pond, pool, stream"), from Proto-Germanic *"lakÅ" ("pond, ditch, slow moving stream"), from the Proto-Indo-European root *"leÇµ-" ("to leak, drain"). Cognates include Dutch "laak" ("lake, pond, ditch"), Middle Low German "lÄke" ("water pooled in a riverbed, puddle"), German "Lache" ("pool, puddle"), and Icelandic "lÃ¦kur" ("slow flowing stream"). Also related are the English words "leak" and "leach".
There is considerable uncertainty about defining the difference between lakes and ponds, and no current internationally accepted definition of either term across scientific disciplines or political boundaries exists. For example, limnologists have defined lakes as water bodies which are simply a larger version of a pond, which can have wave action on the shoreline or where wind-induced turbulence plays a major role in mixing the water column. None of these definitions completely excludes ponds and all are difficult to measure. For this reason there has been increasing use made of simple size-based definitions to separate ponds and lakes. One definition of "lake" is a body of water of or more in area; however, others have defined lakes as waterbodies of and above, or and above (see also the definition of "pond"). Charles Elton, one of the founders of ecology, regarded lakes as waterbodies of or more. The term "lake" is also used to describe a feature such as Lake Eyre, which is a dry basin most of the time but may become filled under seasonal conditions of heavy rainfall. In common usage many lakes bear names ending with the word "pond", and a lesser number of names ending with "lake" are in quasi-technical fact, ponds. One textbook illustrates this point with the following: "In Newfoundland, for example, almost every lake is called a pond, whereas in Wisconsin, almost every pond is called a lake."
One hydrology book proposes to define it as a body of water with the following five chacteristics:
With the exception of the sea water intrusion criterion, the other ones have been accepted or elaborated upon by other hydrology publications.
Distribution of lakes.
The majority of lakes on Earth are fresh water, and most lie in the Northern Hemisphere at higher latitudes. Canada, with a deranged drainage system has an estimated 31,752 lakes larger than and an unknown total number of lakes, but is estimated to be at least 2 million. Finland has 187,888 lakes or larger, of which 56,000 are large ( or larger).
Most lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a river or stream, which maintain a lake's average level by allowing the drainage of excess water. Some lakes do not have a natural outflow and lose water solely by evaporation or underground seepage or both. They are termed endorheic lakes.
Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for hydro-electric power generation, aesthetic purposes, recreational purposes, industrial use, agricultural use or domestic water supply.
Evidence of extraterrestrial lakes exists; "definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane" was announced by NASA as returned by the Cassini Probe observing the moon Titan, which orbits the planet Saturn.
Globally, lakes are greatly outnumbered by ponds: of an estimated 304 million standing water bodies worldwide, 91% are or less in area (see definition of ponds). Small lakes are also much more numerous than large lakes: in terms of area, one-third of the world's standing water is represented by lakes and ponds of or less. However, large lakes account for much of the area of standing water with 122 large lakes of 1,000 square kilometres (390 sq mi, 100,000 ha, 247,000 acres) or more representing about 29% of the total global area of standing inland water.
Origin of natural lakes.
There are a number of natural processes that can form lakes. A recent tectonic uplift of a mountain range can create bowl-shaped depressions that accumulate water and form lakes. The advance and retreat of glaciers can scrape depressions in the surface where water accumulates; such lakes are common in Scandinavia, Patagonia, Siberia and Canada. The most notable examples are probably the Great Lakes of North America.
Lakes can also form by means of landslides or by glacial blockages. An example of the latter occurred during the last ice age in the U.S. state of Washington, when a huge lake formed behind a glacial flow; when the ice retreated, the result was an immense flood that created the Dry Falls at Sun Lakes, Washington.
Salt lakes (also called saline lakes) can form where there is no natural outlet or where the water evaporates rapidly and the drainage surface of the water table has a higher-than-normal salt content. Examples of salt lakes include Great Salt Lake, the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea.
Small, crescent-shaped lakes called oxbow lakes can form in river valleys as a result of meandering. The slow-moving river forms a sinuous shape as the outer side of bends are eroded away more rapidly than the inner side. Eventually a horseshoe bend is formed and the river cuts through the narrow neck. This new passage then forms the main passage for the river and the ends of the bend become silted up, thus forming a bow-shaped lake.
Crater lakes are formed in volcanic craters and calderas which fill up with precipitation more rapidly than they empty via evaporation. Sometimes the latter are called caldera lakes, although often no distinction is made. An example is Crater Lake in Oregon, located within the caldera of Mount Mazama. The caldera was created in a massive volcanic eruption that led to the subsidence of Mount Mazama around 4860 BC.
Gloe Lakes are freshwater lakes that have emerged when the water they consists of has been separated, not considerably long before, from the sea as a consequence of post-glacial rebound.
Some lakes, such as Lake Jackson in Florida, USA, come into existence as a result of sinkhole activity.
Lake Vostok is a subglacial lake in Antarctica, possibly the largest in the world. The pressure from the ice atop it and its internal chemical composition mean that, if the lake were drilled into, a fissure could result that would spray somewhat like a geyser.
Most lakes are geologically young and shrinking since the natural results of erosion will tend to wear away the sides and fill the basin. Exceptions are those such as Lake Baikal and Lake Tanganyika that lie along continental rift zones and are created by the crust's subsidence as two plates are pulled apart. These lakes are the oldest and deepest in the world. Lake Baikal, which is 25-30 million years old, is deepening at a faster rate than it is being filled by erosion and may be destined over millions of years to become attached to the global ocean. The Red Sea, for example, is thought to have originated as a rift-valley lake.
Characteristics.
Lakes have numerous features in addition to lake type, such as drainage basin (also known as catchment area), inflow and outflow, nutrient content, dissolved oxygen, pollutants, pH, and sedimentation.
Changes in the level of a lake are controlled by the difference between the input and output compared to the total volume of the lake. Significant input sources are precipitation onto the lake, runoff carried by streams and channels from the lake's catchment area, groundwater channels and aquifers, and artificial sources from outside the catchment area. Output sources are evaporation from the lake, surface and groundwater flows, and any extraction of lake water by humans. As climate conditions and human water requirements vary, these will create fluctuations in the lake level.
Lakes can be also categorized on the basis of their richness in nutrients, which typically affect plant growth. Nutrient-poor lakes are said to be "oligotrophic" and are generally clear, having a low concentration of plant life. "Mesotrophic lakes" have good clarity and an average level of nutrients. "Eutrophic" lakes are enriched with nutrients, resulting in good plant growth and possible algal blooms. "Hypertrophic" lakes are bodies of water that have been excessively enriched with nutrients. These lakes typically have poor clarity and are subject to devastating algal blooms. Lakes typically reach this condition due to human activities, such as heavy use of fertilizers in the lake catchment area. Such lakes are of little use to humans and have a poor ecosystem due to decreased dissolved oxygen.
Due to the unusual relationship between water's temperature and its density, lakes form layers called thermoclines, layers of drastically varying temperature relative to depth. Fresh water is most dense at about 4 degrees Celsius (39.2Â Â°F) at sea level. When the temperature of the water at the surface of a lake reaches the same temperature as deeper water, as it does during the cooler months in temperate climates, the water in the lake can mix, bringing oxygen-starved water up from the depths and bringing oxygen down to decomposing sediments. Deep temperate lakes can maintain a reservoir of cold water year-round, which allows some cities to tap that reservoir for deep lake water cooling.
Since the surface water of deep tropical lakes never reaches the temperature of maximum density, there is no process that makes the water mix. The deeper layer becomes oxygen starved and can become saturated with carbon dioxide, or other gases such as sulfur dioxide if there is even a trace of volcanic activity. Exceptional events, such as earthquakes or landslides, can cause mixing which rapidly brings the deep layers up to the surface and release a vast cloud of gas which lay trapped in solution in the colder water at the bottom of the lake. This is called a limnic eruption. An example is the disaster at Lake Nyos in Cameroon. The amount of gas that can be dissolved in water is directly related to pressure. As deep water surfaces, the pressure drops and a vast amount of gas comes out of solution. Under these circumstances carbon dioxide is hazardous because it is heavier than air and displaces it, so it may flow down a river valley to human settlements and cause mass asphyxiation.
The material at the bottom of a lake, or "lake bed", may be composed of a wide variety of inorganics, such as silt or sand, and organic material, such as decaying plant or animal matter. The composition of the lake bed has a significant impact on the flora and fauna found within the lake's environs by contributing to the amounts and the types of nutrients available.
A paired (black and white) layer of the varved lake sediments correspond to a year. During winter, when organisms die, carbon is deposited down, resulting to a black layer. At the same year, during summer, only few organic materials are deposited, resulting to a white layer at the lake bed. These are commonly used to track past paleontological events.
Natural lakes provide a microcosm of living and nonliving elements that are relatively independent of their surrounding environments. Therefore, lake organisms can often be studied in isolation from the lakeâs surroundings. 
Limnology.
Limnology is the study of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. Limnology divides lakes into three zones: the "littoral zone", a sloped area close to land; the "photic" or "open-water zone", where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water "profundal" or "benthic zone", where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on turbidity, determined by the density and size of suspended particles. A particle is in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include algae and detritus. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous fish can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (planktonivorous) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic trophic cascade). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a "Secchi disk", a 20-cm (8Â in) disk with alternating white and black quadrants. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the "Secchi depth", a measure of transparency. The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication. For a detailed look at these processes, see lentic ecosystems.
A lake moderates the surrounding region's temperature and climate because water has a very high specific heat capacity (4,186 JÂ·kgâ1Â·Kâ1). In the daytime a lake can cool the land beside it with local winds, resulting in a sea breeze; in the night it can warm it with a land breeze.
How lakes disappear.
[[File:Badwater tm5 2007046.jpg|thumb|Badwater Basin dry lake, February 15, 2007.

The lake may be infilled with deposited sediment and gradually become a wetland such as a swamp or marsh. Large water plants, typically totos, accelerate this closing process significantly because they partially decompose to form peat soils that fill the shallows. Conversely, peat soils in a marsh can naturally burn and reverse this process to recreate a shallow lake. Turbid lakes and lakes with many plant-eating fish tend to disappear more slowly. A "disappearing" lake (barely noticeable on a human timescale) typically has extensive plant mats at the water's edge. These become a new habitat for other plants, like peat moss when conditions are right, and animals, many of which are very rare. Gradually the lake closes and young peat may form, forming a fen. In lowland river valleys where a river can meander, the presence of peat is explained by the infilling of historical oxbow lakes. In the very last stages of succession, trees can grow in, eventually turning the wetland into a forest.
Some lakes can disappear seasonally. These are called intermittent lakes, ephemeral lakes, or seasonal lakes and can be found in karstic terrain. A prime example of an intermittent lake is Lake Cerknica in Slovenia or Lag Prau Pulte in GraubÃ¼nden. Other intermittent lakes are only the result of above-average precipitation in a closed, or endorheic basin, usually filling dry lake beds. This can occur in some of the driest places on earth, like Death Valley. This occurred in the spring of 2005, after unusually heavy rains. The lake did not last into the summer, and was quickly evaporated (see photos to right). A more commonly filled lake of this type is Sevier Lake of west-central Utah.
Sometimes a lake will disappear quickly. On 3 June 2005, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia, a lake called Lake Beloye vanished in a matter of minutes. News sources reported that government officials theorized that this strange phenomenon may have been caused by a shift in the soil underneath the lake that allowed its water to drain through channels leading to the Oka River.
The presence of ground permafrost is important to the persistence of some lakes. According to research published in the journal "Science" ("Disappearing Arctic Lakes", June 2005), thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The idea here is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost, allowing the lakes to drain away into the ground.
Some lakes disappear because of human development factors. The shrinking Aral Sea is described as being "murdered" by the diversion for irrigation of the rivers feeding it.
Extraterrestrial lakes.
Only one world other than Earth is known to harbor large lakes, Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Photographs and spectroscopic analysis by the CassiniâHuygens spacecraft show liquid ethane on the surface, which is thought to be mixed with liquid methane. The largest Titanean lake, Kraken Mare at 400,000Â km2, is three-times the size of any lake on Earth, and even the second, Ligeia Mare, is estimated to be slightly larger than Earth's Lake MichiganâHuron. 
Jupiter's large moon Io is volcanically active, and as a result sulfur deposits have accumulated on the surface. Some photographs taken during the Galileo mission appear to show lakes of liquid sulfur in volcanic caldera, though these are more analogous to lake of lava than of water on Earth.
The planet Mars is too cold and has too little atmospheric pressure to permit the pooling of liquid water. Geologic evidence appears to confirm, however, that ancient lakes once formed on the surface. It is also possible that volcanic activity on Mars will occasionally melt subsurface ice, creating large temporary lakes. This water would quickly freeze and then sublimate, unless insulated in some manner, such as by a coating of volcanic ash.
There are dark basaltic plains on the Moon, similar to lunar maria but smaller, that are called "lacus" (singular "lacus", Latin for "lake") because they were thought by early astronomers to be lakes of water.

Ibaiondo is the 5th district of the city of Bilbao (Basque Country, Spain). "Ibaiondo" is a recently used name and in Basque language means "Beside the river". It is divided into the neighbourhoods of Atxuri, Bilbo Zarra, Casco Viejo, Iturralde, Abusu, San AdriÃ¡n, San Francisco, Solokoetxe, Miribilla and Zabala. 
The original walled city, the "Casco Viejo", is located in this district, including the oldest buildings of the city like the Santiago Cathedral and Saint Anton Church, both from the 15th century. 
Today the modern district includes both the oldest and the newest neighbourhood, Miribilla, which was started in 1999 and completed two years after.
It is the most extensive district of Bilbao, with an area of 9.65 kmÂ² (25% of the municipality) but the urban area has an area of only 2.45 kmÂ², the rest of the district is part of mount Pagasarri. It is also the city's most populated district, with 57,340 inhabitants in 2006.

Dundee Corporation Tramways

Dundee Corporation Tramways formerly served the City of Dundee, Scotland. The tram system was replaced by buses in 1956.
Origins.
Horse-drawn trams were first introduced in 1877 by the Dundee and District Tramways followed by steam haulage in the 1880s. Dundee's trams came under municipal management in 1893. The City Corporation then replaced the steam and horse trams with electric traction between 1900 and 1902. The track was Standard gauge.
The system.
The system was publicly owned and operated by Dundee Corporation (the predecessor of the present Dundee City Council). It was one of the smallest municipal tram systems in Great Britain, with approximately 100 trams in the 1930s, declining to only 55 after World War II. The trams were all double-decked, four-wheeled and painted in a green and cream livery.
Many electric trams continued in service until after World War II, by which time their replacement had become urgent. The system was closed in October 1956, with the remaining trams being replaced by Dundee Corporation diesel buses.
Lochee trams.
The last trams built for Dundee were numbered 19-28 inclusive, better known as the "Lochee" trams. They were built in 1930 by Brush of Loughborough. As the widest trams in the fleet, they were restricted to the Lochee Road route. They were withdrawn on the closure of the route in 1956.
Successor company.
Following local government reorganisation in 1975 the Dundee Corporation Transport Department was transferred to Tayside Regional Council. Following deregulation and privatisation, the successor company is Travel Dundee (which is being rebranded as National Express Dundee).

AdelswÃ¤rd (baronial family)

AdelswÃ¤rd is a Swedish Baronial family, descended from the Hultman line of the extinct noble family AdelswÃ¤rd. The titular governor Johan AdelswÃ¤rd (1718-1785) was created a Swedish Baron 11 December 1770 at Stockholm Palace by King Gustavus III of Sweden, and was introduced 12 December 1771 at Riddarhuset as Baronial family number 249, thus making the noble family AdelswÃ¤rd extinct. The just mentioned Johan AdelswÃ¤rd founded the fee tail AdelsnÃ¤s, which constitutes the "Barony AdelswÃ¤rd", the only one of its kind in Sweden.
The family has members in Sweden, Canada and the United States, and one of its members, Baron Eric Reinhold AdelswÃ¤rd (1778-1840), was created a Swedish Count 1823, thus founding the comital family AdelswÃ¤rd.

Deferred financing cost

Deferred financing costs or debt issuance costs is an accounting concept meaning costs associated with issuing debt (loans and bonds), such as various fees and commissions paid to investment banks, law firms, auditors, regulators, and so on. Since these payments generate future benefits, they are treated as an asset. The costs are capitalized, reflected in the balance sheet as an asset, and amortized over the finite life of the underlying debt instrument. The unamortized amounts are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Early debt repayment results in expensing these costs.
Under U.S. GAAP, when issuing securities without specific maturity, such as perpetual preferred stock, financing costs reduce the amount of paid in capital associated with that security.
Tax Treatment
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, DFC are generally amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-line method.

Spanish Civil War

The Spanish Civil War () was fought from 17 July 1936 to 1 April 1939 between the Republicans, who were loyal to the democratically elected Spanish Republic, and the Nationalists, a rebel group led by General Francisco Franco. The Nationalists prevailed, and Franco ruled Spain for the next 36 years, from 1939 until his death in 1975.
The war began after a "pronunciamiento" (declaration of opposition) by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, under the leadership of JosÃ© Sanjurjo, against the elected government of the Second Spanish Republic, at the time under the leadership of President Manuel AzaÃ±a. The rebel coup was supported by a number of conservative groups, including the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right, monarchists such as the religious conservative Carlists, and the Fascist Falange.
The coup was supported by military units in Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos, Valladolid, CÃ¡diz, Cordova, and Seville. However, rebelling units in important citiesâsuch as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, and MÃ¡lagaâwere unable to capture their objectives, and those cities remained in control of the government. Spain was thus left militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists, now led by General Francisco Franco, and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions and soldiers from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, while the Soviet Union and Mexico intervened in support of the "Loyalist", or "Republican", side. Other countries, such as Britain and France, operated an official policy of non-intervention, although France did send in some munitions.
The Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. Capturing large parts of Catalonia in 1938 and 1939, the war ended with the victory of the Nationalists and the exile of thousands of left-leaning Spaniards, many of whom fled to refugee camps in southern France. Those associated with the losing Republicans were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists. With the establishment of a fascist dictatorship led by General Francisco Franco in the aftermath of the war, all right-wing parties were fused into the structure of the Franco regime.
The war became notable for the passion and political division it inspired, and for the atrocities committed by both sides. Organized purges occurred in territory captured by Franco's forces to consolidate the future regime. A smaller but significant number of killings took place in areas controlled by the Republicans, normally associated with a breakdown in law and order. The extent to which Republican authorities connived in Republican territory killings varied.
Background.
At the end of the 19th century, the owners of large estates, called "latifundia", held most of the power in a land-based oligarchy. The landowners' power was unsuccessfully challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors. In 1868, popular uprisings led to the overthrow of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. In 1873, Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. After the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874, Carlists and Anarchists emerged in opposition to the monarchy. Alejandro Lerroux, Spanish politician and leader of the Radical Republican Party, helped bring republicanism to the fore in Catalonia, where poverty was particularly acute. Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909.
Spain was neutral in the First World War. Afterwards the working class, the industrial class, and the military united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful. Fears of communism grew. A military coup brought Miguel Primo de Rivera to power in 1923, and he ran Spain as a military dictatorship. Support for his regime gradually faded, and he resigned in January 1930. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities, and King Alfonso XIII abdicated. The Second Spanish Republic was formed and would remain in power until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War.
Niceto AlcalÃ¡-Zamora became the first prime minister. The republic had broad support from all segments of society. Elections in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists. With the onset of the Great Depression, the government attempted to assist rural Spain by instituting an eight-hour day and giving tenure to farm workers. Fascism remained a reactive threat, helped by controversial reforms to the military. In December, a new reformist, liberal, and democratic constitution was declared. It included strong provisions enforcing a broad secularization of this Catholic country, which many moderate committed Catholics opposed. In October 1931, Manuel AzaÃ±a became prime minister of a minority government. In 1933, the right won the general elections, following an unsuccessful uprising by General JosÃ© Sanjurjo in August 1932.
Events in the period following November 1933, called the "black two years," seemed to make a civil war more likely. Alejandro Lerroux of the Radical Republican Party (RRP) formed a government and rolled back changes made under the previous administration. Some monarchists joined with the Fascist Falange EspaÃ±ola to help achieve their aims. Open violence occurred in the streets of Spanish cities, and militancy continued to increase, reflecting a movement towards radical upheaval, rather than peaceful democratic means as solutions.
In the last months of 1934, two government collapses brought members of the right-wing Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) into the government. Farm workers' wages were cut in half, and the military was purged of Republican members. A Popular Front alliance was organized, which narrowly won the 1936 elections. AzaÃ±a led a weak minority government, but soon replaced Zamora as president in April. Prime Minister Santiago Casares Quiroga
ignored warnings of a military conspiracy involving several generals, who decided that the government had to be replaced to prevent the dissolution of Spain.
Military coup.
Preparations.
In an attempt to remove suspect generals from their posts, the Republican government sacked Franco as chief of staff and transferred him to command of the Canary Islands. Manuel Goded Llopis was removed as Inspector General and was made general of the Balearic islands. Emilio Mola was moved from head of the Army of Africa to military commander of Pamplona in Navarre. This, however, allowed Mola to direct the mainland uprising. General JosÃ© Sanjurjo became the figurehead of the operation and helped reach an agreement with the Carlists. Mola was chief planner and second in command. JosÃ© Antonio Primo de Rivera was put in prison in mid-March in order to restrict the Falange. However, government actions were not as thorough as they might have been, and warnings by the Director of Security and other figures were not acted upon.
On 12 June, Prime Minister Casares Quiroga met General Juan YagÃ¼e, who managed to falsely convince Casares of his loyalty to the republic. Mola began serious planning in the spring. Franco was a key player because of his prestige as a former director of the military academy and as the man who suppressed the Socialist uprising of 1934. He was well respected in the Army of Africa, the Spanish Republican Army's toughest military force. He wrote a cryptic letter to Casares on 23 June, suggesting that the military was disloyal, but could be restrained if he were put in charge. Casares did nothing, failing to arrest or buy off Franco. On 5 July, an aircraft was chartered to take Franco from the Canary Islands to Morocco. It arrived on 14 July.
On 12 July 1936, in Madrid, members of the Falange murdered Lieutenant JosÃ© Castilloâa Socialist party memberâof the Assault Guards police force. The next day, members of the Assault Guards arrested JosÃ© Calvo Sotelo, a leading Spanish monarchist and a prominent parliamentary conservative. Calvo Sotelo was shot by the Guards without trial. The killing of Calvo Sotelo, with involvement of the police, aroused suspicions and strong reactions among the government's opponents on the right. Massive reprisals followed. Although the conservative Nationalist generals were already in the advanced stages of a planned uprising, the event provided a catalyst and convenient public justification for their coup. The Socialists and Communists (led by Prieto) demanded that arms be distributed to the people before the military took over. The prime minister was hesitant.
Beginning of the coup.
[[File:Guerra Civil EspaÃ±ola.svg|thumb|350px|General map of the Spanish Civil War (1936â1939).
The uprising's timing was fixed at 17 July, at 17:01, agreed to by the leader of the Carlists, Manuel Fal CondÃ©. However, the timing was changedâthe men in Spanish Morocco were to rise up at 05:00, and those in Spain itself starting exactly a day later, so that control of Spanish Morocco could be achieved and forces sent to Iberia from Morocco to coincide with the risings there. The rising was intended to be a swift coup d'Ã©tat, but the government retained control of most of the country.
Control over Spanish Morocco was all but certain. The plan was discovered in Morocco on 17 July, which prompted the conspirators to enact it immediately. Little resistance was encountered. In total, the rebels shot 189 people. Goded and Franco immediately took control of the islands to which they were assigned. On 18 July, Casares Quiroga refused an offer of help from the ConfederaciÃ³n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and UniÃ³n General de Trabajadores (UGT), leading the groups to proclaim a general strikeâin effect, mobilizing. They opened weapons caches, some buried since the 1934 risings. The paramilitary forces often waited to see the outcome of militia action before either joining or suppressing the rebellion. Quick action by either the rebels or anarchist militias was often enough to decide the fate of a town. General Queipo de Llano managed to secure Seville for the rebels, arresting a number of other officers.
Outcome.
The rebels failed to take any major cities, with the critical exception of Seville, which provided a landing point for Franco's African troops, and the primarily conservative and Catholic areas of Old Castile and LeÃ³n, which fell quickly. Cadiz was taken for the rebels, with the help of the first troops from the Army of Africa.
The government retained control of MÃ¡laga, JaÃ©n, and AlmerÃ­a. In Madrid, the rebels were hemmed into the MontaÃ±a barracks, which fell with considerable bloodshed. Republican leader Casares Quiroga was replaced by JosÃ© Giral, who ordered the distribution of weapons among the civilian population. This facilitated the defeat of the army insurrection in the main industrial centres, including Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia, but it allowed the anarchists to take control of Barcelona, along with large swathes of Aragon and Catalonia. General Goded surrendered in Barcelona and was later condemned to death.
The Republican government ended up controlling almost all of the east coast and central area around Madrid, as well as Asturias, Cantabria and part of the Basque Country in the north.
The rebels termed themselves "Nacionales", normally translated as "Nationalists", though the former implies "true Spaniards" rather than a pure nationalistic cause. The result of the coup was a nationalist area of control containing 11 million of Spain's population of 25 million. The Nationalists had secured the support of around half of Spain's territorial army, some 60,000 men, joined by the Army of Africa, made up of 35,000 men, and a little under half of Spain's militaristic police forces, the Assault Guards, the Civil Guards, and the Carabineers. Republicans controlled under half of the rifles and about a third of both machine guns and artillery pieces.
The Spanish Republican Army had just 18 tanks of a sufficiently modern design, and the Republicans took control of 10. Naval capacity was uneven, with the Republicans retaining a numerical advantage, but with the Navy's top commanders and two of the most modern ships, heavy cruisers "Canarias" âcaptured at the Ferrol shipyardâ and "Baleares", in Nationalist hands. The Spanish Republican Navy suffered from the same problems as the armyâmany officers had defected or had been killed after trying to do so. Two-thirds of air capability was retained by the governmentÂ â however, the whole of the Republican Air Force was very outdated.
Combatants.
The war was cast by Republican sympathizers as a struggle between tyranny and democracy, and by Nationalist supporters as between communist and anarchist "red hordes" and "Christian civilization". Nationalists also claimed they were protecting the establishment and bringing security and direction to an ungoverned and lawless society.
Spanish politics, especially on the left, were quite fragmented, since socialists and communists supported the republic. During the republic, anarchists had had mixed opinions, but major groups opposed the Nationalists during the Civil War. The Conservatives, in contrast, were united by their fervent opposition to the Republican government and presented a more unified front.
Republicans.
The Republicans received weapons and volunteers from the Soviet Union, Mexico, the international Marxists movement, and International Brigades. Their supporters ranged from centrists who supported a moderately capitalist liberal democracy to revolutionary anarchists. Their base was primarily secular and urban, but also included landless peasants, and was particularly strong in industrial regions like Asturias and Catalonia.
This faction was called variously "loyales" ("loyalists") by supporters; "Republicans", the "Popular Front", or "the government" by all parties; and/or "los rojos" ("the reds") by their opponents. Republicans were supported by most urban workers, a large share of peasants, and much of the educated middle class.
The conservative, strongly Catholic Basque country, along with Galicia and the more left-leaning Catalonia, sought autonomy, or even independence, from the central government of Madrid. The Republican government allowed for the possibility of self-government for the two regions, whose forces were gathered under the People's Republican Army ("EjÃ©rcito Popular Republicano", or EPR), which was reorganized into mixed brigades after October 1936.
A few well-known people fought on the Republican side, such as English novelist George Orwell and Canadian physician and medical innovator Norman Bethune.
Nationalists.
The Nationalists ("nacionales")âalso called "insurgents", "rebels", or, by opponents, ""Franquists"" or ""fascists""âfeared national fragmentation and opposed the separatist movements. They were chiefly defined by their anti-communism, which galvanized diverse or opposed movements like falangists and monarchists. Their leaders had a generally wealthier, more conservative, monarchist, landowning background.
The Nationalist side included the Carlists and Alfonsist monarchists, Spanish nationalists, the fascist Falange, and most conservatives and monarchist liberals. Virtually all Nationalist groups had strong Catholic convictions and supported the native Spanish clergy. The Nationals included the majority of the Catholic clergy and practitioners (outside of the Basque region), important elements of the army, most large landowners, and many businessmen.
One of the rightists' principal motives was to confront the anti-clericalism of the Republican regime and to defend the Church, which had been targeted by opponents, including Republicans, who blamed the institution for the country's ills. On the other hand, the Church was against the Republicans' liberal principles, which were fortified by the Spanish Constitution of 1931. Prior to the war, in the Asturias uprising of 1934, religious buildings were burnt and at least 100 clergy, religious civilians, and police were killed by revolutionaries.
Franco had brought in the mercenaries of Spain's colonial Army of Africa and reduced the miners to submission by heavy artillery attacks and bombing raids. The Spanish Foreign Legion committed atrocitiesâmany women and children were killed, and the army carried out summary execution of leftists. The repression in the aftermath was brutal. In Asturias, prisoners were tortured. Franco believed that he was justified in the brutal use of troops against Spanish civilians. Historian Paul Preston said, "Unmoved by the fact that the central symbol of rightist values was the reconquest of Spain from the Moors, Franco did not hesitate to ship Moorish mercenaries to fight in Asturias, the only part of Spain where the crescent had never flown. He saw no contradiction about using the Moors, because he regarded left-wing workers with the same racialist contempt he possessed towards the tribesmen of the Rif".
Articles 24 and 26 of the 1931 constitution had banned the Jesuits. This proscription deeply offended many within the conservative fold. The revolution in the Republican zone at the outset of the war, in which 7,000 clergy and thousands of lay people were killed, deepened Catholic support for the Nationalists.
The Moroccan "Regulares" joined the rebellion and played a significant role in the civil war. In a 2009 news story, Reuters reported, "About 136,000 Moroccan fighters fought for the Generalissimo's Army of Africa, the feared vanguard of a force that, ironically, Franco portrayed as a Christian crusade against godless communists".
Other factions.
Catalan and Basque nationalists were not univocal. Left-wing Catalan nationalists sided with the Republicans, while Conservative Catalan nationalists were far less vocal in supporting the government due to anti-clericalism and confiscations occurring in areas within its control. Basque nationalists, heralded by the conservative Basque Nationalist Party, were mildly supportive of the Republican government, even though some in Navarre sided with the uprising for the same reasons influencing conservative Catalans. Notwithstanding religious matters, Basque nationalists, who were for the most part Catholic, generally sided with the Republicans.
Foreign involvement.
The Spanish Civil War seized the fears and hopes of the world, including not just diplomats and politicians, but intellectuals, religious leaders, and labor unions, as well. Opinion divided three ways. The right and the Catholics supported the Nationalists as a way to stop the expansion of Bolshevism. On the left, including labor unions, students and intellectuals, the war represented a necessary battle to stop the spread of fascism. Antiwar and pacifist sentiment was strong in many countries, leading to warnings that the Civil War had the potential of escalating into a second world war. In retrospect, however, the Spanish Civil War was not a prelude to the Second World War, but rather an indicator of the growing instability encompassing the whole of Europe.
The Civil War involved large numbers of non-Spanish citizens who participated in combat and advisory positions. Germany sent a Luftwaffe unit and modern warplanes. Italy sent 100,000 men. Britain and France led a bloc of 27 nations that promised an embargo on all arms to Spain. The United States unofficially went along. Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union also signed on officially, but blatantly ignored the embargo. The attempted suppression of imported materials was largely ineffective, however, and France especially was accused of allowing large shipments to Republican troops. The clandestine actions of the various European powers were, at the time, considered to be risking another "Great War", alarming antiwar elements across the world.
The League of Nations' reaction to the war was slightly biased against communism, and insufficient to contain the massive importation by fighting factions of arms and other war resources. Although a Non-Intervention Committee was formed, its policies accomplished little, and its directives were ineffective. The official Spanish Government of Juan NegrÃ­n was gradually abandoned within the organization during this period.
Support for the Nationalists.
Germany.
German involvement began days after fighting broke out in July 1936. Adolf Hitler quickly sent in powerful air and armored units to assist the Nationalists. The war provided combat experience with the latest technology for the German military. However, the intervention also posed the risk of escalating into a world war for which Hitler was not ready. He therefore limited his aid, and instead encouraged Benito Mussolini to send in large Italian units.
Nazi actions included the formation of the multitasking Condor Legion, while German efforts to move the Army of Africa to mainland Spain proved successful in the war's early stages. German operations slowly expanded to include strike targets, most notablyÂ â and controversiallyÂ â the bombing of Guernica which, on 26 April 1937, killed 200 to 300 civilians.
German involvement was further manifested through undertakings such as Operation Ursula, a U-boat undertaking, and contributions from the Kriegsmarine. The Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories, particularly in aerial combat, while Spain further provided a proving ground for German tank tactics. The training German units provided to Nationalist forces would prove valuable. By the War's end, perhaps 56,000 Nationalist soldiers, encompassing infantry, artillery, aerial and naval forces, had been trained by German detachments.
A total of approximately 16,000 German citizens fought in the war, including approximately 300 killed, though no more than 10,000 participated at any one time. German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately Â£43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices, 15.5% of which was used for salaries and expenses and 21.9% for direct delivery of supplies to Spain, while 62.6% was expended on the Condor Legion. In total, Germany provided the Nationalists with 600 planes and 200 tanks.
Italy.
After Francisco Franco's request and encouragement by Hitler, Benito Mussolini joined the war. While the conquest of Ethiopia made Italy confident in its power, a Spanish ally would nonetheless help secure Italian control of the Mediterranean. The Royal Italian Navy ("Regia Marina") played a substantial role in the Mediterranean blockade, and ultimately Italy supplied machine guns, artillery, aircraft, tankettes, the Legionary Air Force (), and the Corps of Volunteer Troops (, or CTV) to the Nationalist cause. The Italian CTV would, at its peak, supply the Nationalists with 50,000 men. Italian warships took part in breaking the Republican navy's blockade of Nationalist-held Spanish Morocco and took part in naval bombardment of Republican-held Malaga, Valencia, and Barcelona. In total, Italy provided the Nationalists with 660 planes, 150 tanks, 800 artillery pieces, 10,000 machine guns, and 240,000 rifles.
Portugal.
The Estado Novo regime of Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar played an important role in supplying Franco's forces with ammunition and logistical help. Despite its discreet direct military involvementÂ ârestrained to a somewhat "semi-official" endorsement, by its authoritarian regime, of a volunteer force of up to 20,000, so-called "Viriatos"Â âfor the whole duration of the conflict, Portugal was instrumental in providing the Nationalists with organizational skills and reassurance from the Iberian neighbour to Franco and his allies that no interference would hinder the supply traffic directed to the Nationalist cause.
Others.
Great Britain maintained a position of strong neutrality. It refused to allow arms shipments and sent warships to try to stop shipments. It became a crime to volunteer to fight in Spain, but about 4,000 went anyway. Intellectuals strongly favoured the Republicans. Many visited, hoping to find authenticity and anti-fascism. They had little impact on the government, and could not shake the strong public mood for peace. The Labour Party was split, with its Catholic element favouring the Nationalists. It finally voiced some support to Loyalists.
Romanian volunteers were led by Ion I MoÅ£a, deputy-leader of the Legion of the Archangel Michael (or Iron Guard), whose group of seven Legionaries visited Spain in December 1936 to ally their movement with the Nationalists.
Despite the Irish government's prohibition against participating in the war, around 600 Irishmen, followers of Irish political activist Eoin O'Duffy, known as the "Irish Brigade", went to Spain to fight alongside Franco.
Support for the Republicans.
International Brigades.
Many non-Spaniards, often affiliated with radical communist or socialist entities, joined the International Brigades, believing that the Spanish Republic was a front line in the war against fascism. The units represented the largest foreign contingent of those fighting for the Republicans. Roughly 40,000 foreign nationals fought with the Brigades, though no more than 18,000 were entered into the conflict at any given time. They claimed to represent 53 nations.
Significant numbers of volunteers originated in France (10,000), Germany and Austria (5,000), and Italy (3,350). More than 1,000 each came from the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Canada. The ThÃ¤lmann Battalion, a group of Germans, and the Garibaldi Battalion, a group of Italians, distinguished their units during the Siege of Madrid. Americans fought in units such as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, while Canadians joined the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion.
Over 500 Romanians fought on the Republican side, including Romanian Communist Party members Petre BorilÄ and Valter Roman. About 80 volunteers from Ireland formed the Connolly Column, which was immortalized by Irish folk singer Christy Moore in the song "Viva la Quinta Brigada." Some Chinese joined the Brigades, and the majority of them eventually returned to China, while some went to prison or French refugee camps, and a handful remained in Spain.
Soviet Union.
Though General Secretary Joseph Stalin had signed the Non-Intervention Agreement, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics contravened the League of Nations embargo by providing material assistance to the Republican forces, becoming their only source of major weapons. Unlike Hitler and Mussolini, Stalin tried to do this covertly. In total, estimates of material provided by the USSR to the Republicans vary between 634 and 806 planes, 331 and 362 tanks, and 1,034 and 1,895 artillery pieces.
Stalin also created Section X of the Soviet Union military to head the weapons shipment operation, called Operation X. Despite Stalin's interest in aiding the Republicans, the quality of arms was inconsistent. On one hand, many of the rifles and field guns provided were old, obsolete or otherwise of limited use. On the other hand, the T-26 and BT-5 tanks were modern and effective in combat. The Soviet Union supplied aircraft that were in current service with their own forces, but the aircraft provided by Germany to the Nationalists proved superior by the end of the war.
The process of shipping arms from Russia to Spain was extremely slow. Many shipments were lost or arrived only partially matching what had been authorized. Stalin ordered shipbuilders to include false decks in the original designs of ships and, while at sea, Soviet captains employed deceptive flags and paint schemes to evade detection by the Nationalists.
The Republic paid for Soviet arms with official Bank of Spain gold reserves. This would later be the frequent subject of Franquist propaganda, under the term "Moscow Gold". The cost of the Soviet Union arms was more than the value of Spain's gold reserves, the fourth-largest in the world, estimated at US $500 million (1,936 prices), 176 tonnes of which was transferred through France.
The USSR sent a number of military advisers to Spain (2,000â3,000), and, while Soviet troops were fewer than 500 men at a time, Soviet volunteers often operated Soviet-made tanks and aircraft, particularly at the beginning of the war. In addition, the Soviet Union directed Communist parties around the world to organize and recruit the International Brigades.
Another significant Soviet involvement was the activity of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) inside the Republican rearguard. Communist figures including Vittorio Vidali ("Comandante Contreras"), Iosif Grigulevich and, most prominently, Alexander Orlov led operations that included the murders of Catalan Communist politician Andreu Nin and independent left-wing activist JosÃ© Robles.
Mexico.
Unlike the United States and major Latin American governments, such as the ABC Powers and Peru, the Mexican government supported the Republicans. Mexico refused to follow the French-British non-intervention proposals, furnishing $2,000,000 in aid and material assistance, which included 20,000 rifles and 20 million cartridges.
Mexico's most important contributions to the Spanish Republic was its diplomatic help, as well as the sanctuary the nation arranged for Republican refugees, including Spanish intellectuals and orphaned children from Republican families. Some 50,000 took refuge, primarily in Mexico City, accompanied by $300Â million in various treasures still owned by the Left.
France.
Fearing it might spark a civil war inside France, the leftist "Popular Front" government in France did not send direct support to the Republicans. French Prime Minister LÃ©on Blum was sympathetic to the republic, fearing that the success of Nationalist forces in Spain would result in the creation of an ally state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy (largely surrounding France). Right-wing politicians opposed any aid and attacked the Blum government. In July 1936, British officials convinced Blum not to send arms to the Republicans and, on 27 July, the French government declared that it would not send military aid, technology or forces to assist the Republican forces. However, Blum made clear that France reserved the right to provide aid should it wish to the Republic:
On 1 August 1936, a pro-Republican rally of 20,000 people confronted Blum, demanding that he send aircraft to the Republicans, at the same time as right-wing politicians attacked Blum for supporting the Republic and being responsible for provoking Italian intervention on the side of Franco. Germany informed the French ambassador in Berlin that Germany would hold France responsible if it supported "the maneouvres of Moscow" by supporting the Republicans. On 21 August 1936, France signed the Non-Intervention Agreement.
However, the Blum government provided aircraft to the Republicans through covert means with Potez 54 bomber aircraft, Dewoitine aircraft, and Loire 46 fighter aircraft being sent from 7 August 1936 to December of that year to Republican forces. The French also sent pilots and engineers to the Republicans. Also, until 8 September 1936, aircraft could freely pass from France into Spain if they were bought in other countries.
Even after covert support by France to the Republicans ended in December 1936, the possibility of French intervention against the Nationalists remained a serious possibility throughout the war. German intelligence reported to Franco and the Nationalists that the French military was engaging in open discussions about intervention in the war through French military intervention in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. In 1938, Franco feared an immediate French intervention against a potential Nationalist victory in Spain through French occupation of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Spanish Morocco.
Course of the war.
1936.
A large air and sealift of Nationalist troops in Spanish Morocco was organized to the southwest of Spain. Coup leader Sanjurjo was killed in a plane crash on 20 July, leaving an effective command split between Mola in the North and Franco in the South. This period also saw the worst actions of the so-called "Red" and "White" "Terrors" in Spain. On 21 July, the fifth day of the rebellion, the Nationalists captured the central Spanish naval base, located in Ferrol in northwestern Spain.
A rebel force under Colonel Beorlegui Canet, sent by General Mola and Colonel Esteban Garcia, undertook the Campaign of Gipuzkoa from July to September. The capture of Gipuzkoa isolated the Republican provinces in the north. On 5 September, after heavy fighting, the force took IrÃºn, closing the French border to the Republicans. On 15 September, San SebastiÃ¡n, home to a divided Republican force of anarchists and Basque nationalists, was taken by Nationalist soldiers. The Nationalists then advanced toward their capital, Bilbao, but were halted by Republican militias on the border of Biscay at the end of September.
The Republican government under Giral resigned on 4 September, unable to cope with the situation, and was replaced by a mostly Socialist organization under Largo Caballero. The new leadership began to unify central command in the republican zone. On the Nationalist side, Franco was chosen as chief military commander at a meeting of ranking generals at Salamanca on 21 September, now called by the title "GeneralÃ­simo".
Franco won another victory on 27 September when his troops relieved the AlcÃ¡zar in Toledo, which had been held by a Nationalist garrison under Colonel Moscardo since the beginning of the rebellion, resisting thousands of Republican troops, who completely surrounded the isolated building. Two days after relieving the siege, Franco proclaimed himself "Caudillo" ("chieftain"), while forcibly unifying the various and diverse falangist, Royalist, and other elements within the Nationalist cause. The diversion to Toledo gave Madrid time to prepare a defense, but was hailed as a major propaganda victory and personal success for Franco. A similar dramatic success for the Nationalist occurred on 17 October, when troops coming from Galicia relieved the besieged town of Oviedo, in Northern Spain.
In October, the Francoist troops launched a major offensive toward Madrid, reaching it in early November and launching a major assault on the city on 8 November. The Republican government was forced to shift from Madrid to Valencia, outside the combat zone, on 6 November. However, the Nationalists' attack on the capital was repulsed in fierce fighting between 8 and 23 November. A contributory factor in the successful Republican defense was the arrival of the International Brigades, though only an approximate 3,000 foreign volunteers participated in the battle. Having failed to take the capital, Franco bombarded it from the air and, in the following two years, mounted several offensives to try to encircle Madrid. The battle of the Corunna Road, a Nationalist offensive to the northwest, pushed Republican forces back, but failed to isolate Madrid. The battle lasted into January.
1937.
With his ranks swelled by Italian troops and Spanish colonial soldiers from Morocco, Franco made another attempt to capture Madrid in January and February 1937, but was again unsuccessful. The Battle of MÃ¡laga started in mid-January, and this Nationalist offensive in Spain's southeast would turn into a disaster for the Republicans, who were poorly organised and armed. The city was taken by Franco on 8 February. The consolidation of various militias into the Republican Army had started in December 1936. The main Nationalist advance to cross the Jarama river and cut the supply of Madrid by the Valencia road, termed the Battle of Jarama, led to heavy casualties (6,000â20,000) on both sides. The operation's main objective was not met, though Nationalists gained a modest amount of territory.
A similar Nationalist offensive, the Battle of Guadalajara, was a more significant defeat for Franco and his armies. It proved the only publicised Republican victory of the war. Italian troops and blitzkrieg tactics were used by Franco, and while many strategists blamed the latter for the rightists' defeat, the Germans believed it was the former at fault for the Nationalists' 5,000 casualties and loss of valuable equipment. The German strategists successfully argued that the Nationalists needed to concentrate on vulnerable areas first.
The "War in the North" began in mid-March, with Biscay as a first target. The Basques suffered most from the lack of a suitable air force. On 26 April, the Condor Legion bombed the town of Guernica, killing 200-300. The destruction had a significant effect on international opinion. The Basques retreated.
April and May saw infighting among Republican groups in Catalonia. The dispute was between an ultimately victorious governmentÂ âCommunist forces and the anarchist CNT. The disturbance pleased Nationalist command, but little was done to exploit Republican divisions. After the fall of Guernica, the Republican government began to fight back with increasing effectiveness. In July, it made a move to recapture Segovia, forcing Franco to delay his advance on the Bilbao front, but for only two weeks. A similar Republican attack on Huesca failed similarly.
Mola, Franco's second-in-command, was killed on 3 June. In early July, despite the earlier fall in June of Bilbao, the government launched a strong counter-offensive to the west of Madrid, focusing on Brunete. The Battle of Brunete, however, was a significant defeat for the Republic, which lost many of its most accomplished troops. The offensive led to an advance of , and left 25,000 Republican casualties.
A Republican offensive against Zaragoza was also a failure. Despite having land and aerial advantages, the Battle of Belchite resulted in an advance of only and the loss of much equipment. Franco invaded AragÃ³n in August and took the city of Santander. With the surrender of the Republican army in the Basque territory came the SantoÃ±a Agreement. GijÃ³n finally fell in late October. Franco had effectively won in the north. At November's end, with Franco's troops closing in on Valencia, the government had to move again, this time to Barcelona.
1938.
The Battle of Teruel was an important confrontation. The city, which had formerly belonged to the Nationalists, was conquered by Republicans in January. The Francoist troops launched an offensive and recovered the city by 22 February, but Franco was forced to rely heavily on German and Italian air support.
On 7 March, Nationalists launched the Aragon Offensive and, by 14 April, they had pushed through to the Mediterranean, cutting the Republican-held portion of Spain in two. The Republican government attempted to sue for peace in May, but Franco demanded unconditional surrender, and the war raged on. In July, the Nationalist army pressed southward from Teruel and south along the coast toward the capital of the Republic at Valencia, but was halted in heavy fighting along the XYZ Line, a system of fortifications defending Valencia.
The Republican government then launched an all-out campaign to reconnect their territory in the Battle of the Ebro, from 24 July until 26 November. The campaign was unsuccessful, and was undermined by the Franco-British appeasement of Hitler in Munich. The agreement with Britain effectively destroyed Republican morale by ending hope of an anti-fascist alliance with Western powers. The retreat from the Ebro all but determined the final outcome of the war. Eight days before the new year, Franco threw massive forces into an invasion of Catalonia.
1939.
Franco's troops conquered Catalonia in a whirlwind campaign during the first two months of 1939. Tarragona fell on 15 January, followed by Barcelona on 26 January and Girona on 2 February. On 27 February, the United Kingdom and France recognized the Franco regime.
Only Madrid and a few other strongholds remained for the Republican forces. On 5 March 1939, the Republican army, led by the colonel Segismundo Casado and the politician JuliÃ¡n Besteiro, rose against the prime minister Juan Negrin and formed a military "junta" with the Council of National Defense (Consejo Nacional de Defensa or CND) to negotiate a peace deal. Negrin fled to France on 6 March, but the Communist troops around Madrid rose against the junta, starting a brief civil war within the civil war. Casado defeated them, and began peace negotiations with the Nationalists, but Francisco Franco only accepted an unconditional surrender.
On 26 March, the Nationalists started a general offensive, on 28 March the Nationalists occupied Madrid and, by 31 March, they controlled all the Spanish territory. Franco proclaimed victory in a radio speech aired on 1 April, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered.
After the end of the war, there were harsh reprisals against Franco's former enemies. Thousands of Republicans were imprisoned and at least 30,000 executed. Other calculations of these deaths range from 50,000 to 200,000, depending on which killings are included. Many others were put to forced labour, building railways, drying out swamps, and digging canals.
Hundreds of thousands of Republicans fled abroad, with some 500,000 fleeing to France. Refugees were confined in internment camps of the French Third Republic, such as Camp Gurs or Camp Vernet, where 12,000 Republicans were housed in squalid conditions. In his capacity as consul in Paris, Chilean poet and politician Pablo Neruda organized the immigration to Chile of 2,200 Republican exiles in France using the ship "SS Winnipeg."
Of the 17,000 refugees housed in Gurs, farmers and others who could not find relations in France were encouraged by the Third Republic, in agreement with the Franquist government, to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Franquist authorities in IrÃºn. From there, they were transferred to the Miranda de Ebro camp for "purification" according to the Law of Political Responsibilities. After the proclamation by Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain of the Vichy regime, the refugees became political prisoners, and the French police attempted to round up those who had been liberated from the camp. Along with other "undesirable" people, the Spaniards were sent to the Drancy internment camp before being deported to Nazi Germany. About 5,000 Spaniards died in the Mauthausen concentration camp.
After the official end of the war, guerrilla war was waged on an irregular basis by the Spanish Maquis well into the 1950s, gradually reduced by military defeats and scant support from the exhausted population. In 1944, a group of republican veterans, who also fought in the French resistance against the Nazis, invaded the Val d'Aran in northwest Catalonia, but were defeated after 10 days.
Evacuation of children.
The Republicans oversaw the evacuation of 30,000â35,000 children from their zone, starting with Basque areas, from which 20,000 were evacuated. Their destinations included the United Kingdom and the USSR, and many other locations in Europe, along with Mexico. On May 21, 1937, around 4,000 Basque children were taken to the UK on the aging steamship "SS Habana" from the Spanish port of Santurtzi. This was against initial opposition from both the government and charitable groups, who saw the removal of children from their native country as potentially harmful. On arrival two days later in Southampton, the children were dispersed all over England, with over 200 children accommodated in Wales. The upper age limit was initially set at 12, but raised to 15. By mid-September, all of "los niÃ±os", as they became known, had found homes with families. Most were repatriated to Spain after the war, but some 250 still remained in Britain by the end of the Second World War in 1945.
Atrocities.
Death totals remain debated. British historian Antony Beevor wrote in his history of the Civil War that Franco's ensuing "white terror" resulted in the deaths of 200,000 people and that the "red terror" killed 38,000. Julius Ruiz contends that, "Although the figures remain disputed, a minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone, with a maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in Nationalist Spain".
In 2008 a Spanish judge, Baltasar GarzÃ³n, opened an investigation into the executions and disappearances of 114,266 people between 17 July 1936 and December 1951. (GarzÃ³n has since been indicted for violating a 1977 amnesty law through his actions.) Among the executions investigated was that of the poet and dramatist Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca. Mention of his death was forbidden during Franco's regime.
The view of historians, including Helen Graham, Paul Preston, Antony Beevor, Gabriel Jackson and Hugh Thomas, is that the mass executions behind the Nationalists lines were organized and approved by the Nationalists rebel authorities, while the executions behind the Republican lines were the result of the breakdown of the Republican state and anarchy:
Though there was much wanton killing in rebel Spain, the idea of the "limpieza", the "cleaning up", of the country from the evils which had overtaken it, was a disciplined policy of the new authorities and a part of their programme of regeneration. In republican Spain, most of the killing was the consequence of anarchy, the outcome of a national breakdown, and not the work of the state, even though some political parties in some cities abetted the enormities, and even though some of those responsible ultimately rose to positions of authority. â Hugh Thomas
Nationalists.
Nationalists atrocities, which authorities frequently ordered to eradicate any trace of "leftism" in Spain, were common. The notion of a "limpieza" (cleansing) formed an essential part of the rebel strategy, and the process began immediately after an area had been captured. According to historian Paul Preston, the minimum number of those executed by the rebels is 130,000, and is likely to have been far higher, with other historians placing the figure at 200,000 dead. The violence was carried out in the rebel zone by the military, the Civil Guard and the Falange in the name of the regime.
Many such acts were committed by reactionary groups during the first weeks of the war. This included the execution of school teachers, because the efforts of the Second Spanish Republic to promote laicism and displace the Church from schools by closing religious educational institutions were considered by the Nationalists as an attack on the Roman Catholic Church. Extensive killings of civilians were carried out in the cities captured by the Nationalists, along with the execution of unwanted individuals. These included non-combatants such as trade-unionists, Popular Front politicians, suspected Freemasons, Basque, Catalan, Andalusian, and Galician Nationalists, Republican intellectuals, relatives of known Republicans, and those suspected of voting for the Popular Front.
Nationalist forces massacred civilians in Seville, where some 8,000 people were shot; 10,000 were killed in Cordoba; 6,000â12,000 were killed in Badajoz. In Granada, where working-class neighborhoods were hit with artillery and right-wing squads were given free rein to kill government sympathizers, at least 2,000 people were murdered. In February 1937, over 7,000 were killed after the capture of MÃ¡laga. When Bilbao was conquered, thousands of people were sent to prison. There were fewer executions than usual, however, because of the effect Guernica left on Nationalists' reputations internationally. The numbers killed as the columns of the Army of Africa devastated and pillaged their way between Seville and Madrid are particularly difficult to calculate.
Nationalists also murdered Catholic clerics. In one particular incident, following the capture of Bilbao, they took hundreds of people, including 16 priests who had served as chaplains for the Republican forces, to the countryside or graveyards and murdered them.
Franco's forces also persecuted Protestants, including murdering 20 Protestant ministers. Franco's forces were determined to remove the "Protestant heresy" from Spain. The Nationalists also persecuted Basques, as they strove to eradicate Basque culture. According to Basque sources, some 22,000 Basques were murdered by Nationalists immediately after the Civil War.
The Nationalist side conducted aerial bombing of cities in Republican territory, carried out mainly by the "Luftwaffe" volunteers of the "Condor Legion" and the "Italian air force" volunteers of the "Corpo Truppe Volontarie": Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Guernica, Durango, and other cities were attacked. The Bombing of Guernica was among the most controversial.
Republicans.
According to the Nationalists, an estimated 55,000 civilians died in Republican-held territories. This is considered excessive by Antony Beevor. However, it was much less than the half a million claimed during the war. The deaths would form the prevailing outside opinion of the republic up until the bombing of Guernica.
The Republican government was anticlerical, and supporters attacked and murdered Roman Catholic clergy in reaction to the news of military revolt. In his 1961 book, Spanish archbishop Antonio Montero Moreno, who at the time was director of the journal "Ecclesia", wrote that 6,832 were killed during the war, including 4,184 priests, 2,365 monks and friars, and 283 nuns, in addition to 13 bishops, a figure accepted by historians, including Beevor. Some sources claim that by the conflict's end, 20 percent of the nation's clergy had been killed, though some argue the totals were lower. The "Execution" of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Communist militiamen at Cerro de los Ãngeles near Madrid, on 7 August 1936, was the most infamous of widespread desecration of religious property. In dioceses where the Republicans had general control, a large proportion â often a majority â of secular priests were killed.
Like clergy, civilians were executed in Republican territories. Some civilians were executed as suspected Falangists. Others died in acts of revenge after Republicans heard of massacres carried out in the Nationalist zone. Air raids committed against Republican cities were another driving factor. Republican authorities did not order such measures taken. Shopkeepers and industrialists were shot if they didn't sympathize with the Republicans, and were usually spared if they did. Fake justice was sought through a commission, known in Russia as "checas".
As pressure mounted with the increasing success of the Nationalists, many civilians were executed by councils and tribunals controlled by competing Communist and anarchist groups. Some members of the latter were executed by Soviet-advised communist functionaries in Catalonia, as recounted by George Orwell's description of the purges in Barcelona in 1937 in "Homage to Catalonia", which followed a period of increasing tension between competing elements of the Catalan political scene. Some individuals fled to friendly embassies, which would house up to 8,500 people during the war.
In the Andalusian town of Ronda, 512 suspected Nationalists were executed in the first month of the war. Communist Santiago Carrillo Solares was accused of the killing of Nationalists in the Paracuellos massacre near Paracuellos del Jarama. Pro-Soviet Communists committed numerous atrocities against fellow Republicans, including other Marxists: AndrÃ© Marty, known as the Butcher of Albacete, was responsible for the deaths of some 500 members of the International Brigades. Andreu Nin, leader of the POUM (Workers' Party of Marxist Unification), and many other prominent POUM members, were murdered by the Communists, with the help of the USSR's NKVD.
Thirty-eight thousand people were killed in the Republican zone during the war, 17,000 of whom were killed in Madrid or Catalonia within a month of the coup. Whilst the Communists were forthright in their support of extrajudicial killings, much of the Republican side was appalled by the murders. AzaÃ±a came close to resigning. He, alongside other members of Parliament and a great number of other local officials, attempted to prevent Nationalist supporters being lynched. Some of those in positions of power intervened personally to stop the killings.
Social revolution.
In the anarchist-controlled areas, AragÃ³n and Catalonia, in addition to the temporary military success, there was a vast social revolution in which the workers and peasants collectivised land and industry and set up councils parallel to the paralyzed Republican government. This revolution was opposed by the Soviet-supported communists who, perhaps surprisingly, campaigned against the loss of civil property rights.
As the war progressed, the government and the communists were able to exploit their access to Soviet arms to restore government control over the war effort, through diplomacy and force. Anarchists and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ("Partido Obrero de UnificaciÃ³n Marxista", POUM) were integrated into the regular army, albeit with resistance. The POUM was outlawed and falsely denounced as an instrument of the fascists. In the "May Days" of 1937, many thousands of anarchist and communist Republican soldiers fought for control of strategic points in Barcelona.
The pre-war Falange was a small party of some 30,000â40,000 members. It also called for a social revolution that would have seen Spanish society transformed by National Syndicalism. Following the execution of its leader, JosÃ© Antonio Primo de Rivera, by the Republicans, the party swelled in size to several hundred thousand members. The leadership of the Falange suffered 60% casualties in the early days of the civil war, and the party was transformed by new members and rising new leaders, called "camisas nuevas" ("new shirts"), who were less interested in the revolutionary aspects of National Syndicalism. Subsequently, Franco united all rightist parties into the Traditionalist Spanish Falange and the National Syndicalist Offensive Juntas (, FET y de las JONS).
The 1930s also saw Spain become a focus for pacifist organizations, including the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the War Resisters League, and the War Resisters' International. Many people including, as they are now called, the "insumisos" ("defiant ones", conscientious objectors) argued and worked for non-violent strategies. Prominent Spanish pacifists, such as Amparo Poch y GascÃ³n and JosÃ© Brocca, supported the Republicans. Brocca argued that Spanish pacifists had no alternative but to make a stand against fascism. He put this stand into practice by various means, including organizing agricultural workers to maintain food supplies, and through humanitarian work with war refugees.

Culture of Basilan

The Culture of Basilan are derived from the Yakan, Tausug and the Chavacano tribes in the southern Philippines. Both Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, joined by their kin from the Sama, Bajao, Maranao, and other Muslim tribes of Mindanao, while Chavacanos are primarily Christian, joined by the predominantly Christian tribes of the Bisaya, Ilocano, Tagalog and others. These three main groups, however, represent Basilan's tri-people community.
Yakan.
The island is the homeland of the Yakans, a Filipino tribe widely regarded as having been descended from Orang Dampuans (Orang Dyaks, Tagihamas) of the Kingdom of Champa and Eastern Indonesia, and recognized for their colorful costume.
The Yakan have designs or motifs used repeatedly in all their visual arts and crafts. The pussuk labbung is a sawtooth design used for cloth baskets and the native sword called kris. The bunga sama, used for table runners, monuments for the dead and on trunks, is a symmetrical design made of rectangular-shaped figures. The kabban buddi is a set of triangles, squares, and other geometric shapes used for cushions, pillows, casings, mats, and hats. The baggang kettan combines incised triangles and rectangles, and is used to decorate the kris. The ukil lagbas consists of a combination of various lines - wavy, crossed-wavy, and straight - used on shirts, windows of houses, and boats (Sherfan 1976:210-211).
Weapons such as knives and swords are part of the Yakan's visual arts. The punnyal is a small knife, which can be hidden within one's clothing. The barong is carried with pride since it is a symbol of strength and is also acceptable as bride wealth. The taming is the traditional shield used along with two types of spears, the budjak and the sankil, now used only in war dances. The bangkung is another type of bolo seldom used nowadays. The pira is a traditional weapon used by little boys when going on a long journey. The barong and the kris, although popular, are less valuable or admired among the Yakan (Sherfan 1976:156-160).
Yakan visual arts includes Yakan kitchen utensils and household implements. Metal ware includes the talam, a beautifully decorated bronze tray, and the sanduk or ladle used for special occasions. Yakan basketry is both colorful and functional. The tutop is a food cover made of bamboo leaves. The peliyuk is a clay jar with cover used for cooking. The baling is a decorative clay jar treasured as heirloom. The kombo is a lidded container for rice storage. A lakal is a bamboo frame used to hold the cooking gadget when placed on the ground. The tempipih is a big basket carried on the back. A conical basket called the saan is used as a liquid strainer.
Baskets are also used to measure and weigh. The gantang is bigger than the government ganta. The batil measures nine gantang. The laga is 10 gantang. The ilug is 30 gantang. The lukung is equivalent to 100 gantang. An example of Yakan pottery is the poga, a covered clay jar used as water container (Sherfan 1976:201-204).
Yakan women are excellent weavers, and are famous for their beautifully woven traditional costumes of cotton and pineapple cloth. The basic garment for men and women consists of a tight-fitting upper garment with tight-fitting trousers called sawal. The shirt is open in front from lapel down to the waist, using up to 40 sequined or golden buttons. To close the shirt, a long string is crisscrossed from one button to the other so that when tightly drawn, the shirt closes from top to bottom. Usually the shirt remains open since the string is often lost. Over the shirt, male and female wear a tight-fitting jacket, which is exquisitely embroidered in the front and back, with cuffs decorated with multicolored sequins.
The difference in male and female apparel lies in accessories. Men wear a hand woven pis (head cloth) and a 15m-long kandit (belt or sash) made of red cloth called gilim. The pis serves as "protection" from spears and knives during combat, and may be fastened around the trousers. The women wear a short skirt over the trousers, around which a rectangular, hand woven cloth is tied. This cloth is the most expensive part of their costume because it is woven in a tedious manner. Men and women wear the saruk, the Yakan hat worn to make one look more attractive and elegant. Some wear the hat over the turban and use it as a purse for betel nuts, tobacco, and money. Yakan warriors wear a bulletproof shirt prepared by hadjis and imams who write Arabic script all over the shirt (Sherfan 1976:160, 205-207).
Ornaments such as necklaces may be worn as charms. A crocodile tooth polished with a hole at the base is believed to bring good luck when worn as a necklace. The Yakan also wear amulets against bullets. These contain unreadable symbols, are wrapped in black cloth, sewn in triangular form, and tied around the neck. Belts made of snake bones are strung together to protect them against bodily pain. One charm that protects them from sicknesses due to evil spirits is the manik tegiyas - a necklace or bracelet made of the fruits of a flower beaded together. The manik sembulan is made of a bamboo stem cut into short pieces, strung together either as a necklace or bracelet, and serving as added protection against sickness inflicted by evil spirits. To gain more strength against evil spirits, men and women wear the anting-anting. This consists of a string with a piece of cloth containing beads as pendant (Sherfan 1976:143-147).
The Yakan also wear functional gadgets. The pegupaan is a bamboo container for all the paraphernalia for chewing betel nut. The lutuan, a small bronze box with engravings carried at the waist, has a similar function (Sherfan 1976:203).
A unique form of visual arts is the facial make-up done on brides and grooms. After creating a foundation of white powder, the make-up artists proceed to paint dots and lines in various patterns on the faces, creating the effect of formal and elaborate masks which match the ornate costumes of the celebrants.
The Yakan have a rich musical tradition, which may be broadly divided into instrumental and vocal. Yakan musical instruments are made of bamboo, wood, and metal. Their musical instruments also demonstrate the influence of the traditional cycle of rice production in their lives. Several instruments are used in each stage of rice production. The daluppak is a digging stick with a bamboo clapper. The kopak-kopak is a bamboo clapper on a stick. The Kwintangan Kayu is percussion instrument consisting of wooden beams laid after the planting season, to enhance plant growth. The wooden tuntungan is a percussion plank with jar resonators, also played during the harvest season for thanksgiving. 
The gabbang is a bamboo split into five, and arranged like a xylophone. Small children near the fields played it in order to guard the crops against prying animals. The kwintangan batakan is an earlier form of gabbang which has six, seven, or nine bamboo pieces. The suling is a bamboo mouth flute used by the men in courting women. Another bamboo instrument used by the men in expressing love or admiration is the kulaing. The Kulintangan or kwintangan consists of several bronze gongs arranged according to size, and used during celebrations such as weddings and graduations. Any individual played it in the home and after work, for self-expression and relaxation. The agong is a percussion instrument used to announce marriage or for tolling the dead. The jabujabu (djabu-djabu) is a type of drum that summons the people to prayer (Nicolas 1977: 100-108; Sherfan 1976:195-199).
There are three main types of Yakan vocal music: the lugu and other melodies used in reading the Quran and other religious books; the kalangan or songs which may be further reclassified into Jamiluddin and Lunsey; and the katakata, nahana, yaya, lembukayu, and sa-il, among others. The kalangan, jamiluddin, katakata, nahana, and yaya are sung solo, while the lunsey, sa-il, meglubulebu seputangen, and lembukayu involves singers from two groups singing solo as they answer each other. 
The kalangan, jamiluddin, lunsey, and lembukayu are courting songs. The katakata, jamiluddin, and nahana may also narrate the history of the Yakan people. The katakata is a long traditional song narrating the lives, loves, and historical backgrounds of people who lived during early times. The Yakan believed that such stories originated from people who lived in another world. The katakata is sung only at night, at a big gathering with food served by the host or hostess. The singing, in episodes, may last for several nights. The singer lies on a mat, the back supported by several pillows. The audience, either sit or lie around the singer. The jamiluddin relates love stories. At present, it is also sung when families discuss marriage engagements. Both the katakata and jamiluddin are sung by wise men and women of the tribe.
The sa-il and lunsey are sung during a wedding ceremony, with messages revolving around good advice regarding married life. Another type of sa-il is sung during the magtammat or Quranic graduation. 
During social gatherings, the maglebu-lebu seputangan is sung, by a group of men answering a group of women. Each group has a soloist who sings the kalangan, expressed in metaphors. 
The yaya is a lullaby. The magsambag is a method of studying the Quran in which a Murid or student follows the Quranic singing of the teacher. The student and teacher are not allowed to sing together. 
Then there are the songs, which the Yakan sing during daily activities. In keeping watch over rice fields, they sing some forms of the jamiluddin and kalangan. While resting at home, they also leisurely sing the katakata, jamiluddin, and nahana. Children at play imitate the adults in singing the kalangan, jamiluddin, lembukayu, and lugu (Nicolas 1977:97-100).
One popular Yakan dance adopted from the Tausugs Pangalay is called mangalay. The dance is accompanied by the kunlintangan kayu and played by three people. In the Yakan "bumblebee" mimetic dance usually performed by a male dancer, a searcher successfully finds honey with the aid of a torch. He overeats, and the result is a stomachache (Orosa-Goquingco 1980:175). Another example of a mimetic dance is the tahing baila, which imitates the movement of a fish (Tiongson 1991:236). At weddings, the tumahik or war dance is to be performed by the groom as well as male relatives of both the groom and the bride. Dressed in Yakan finery, the dancer uses a spear and a shield to fight an imaginary enemy to the music of the kulintangan. - R. Matilac
Tausug.
The Tausug are the Yakan's traditional rivals in the Sulu Archipelago. Based primarily in the island of Jolo, the Tausug built a powerful maritime confederation of Datus and Rajas extending from the Sulu Archipelago to Palawan and North Borneo. They inhabit Basilan's coastal areas, specifically around the island's southwest and northwestern communities. Known to be fierce warriors and sailors throughout the 16th to the 19th centuries, they withstood Spanish incursions for over 350 years, succumbing only in 1876, and then to the Americans in 1915.
"Tausug" derives from tau meaning "man" and sug meaning "current," and translates into "people of the current." It refers to the majority Islamized group in the Sulu archipelago, their language, and culture. The Tausug, are predominant in the northern part of Sulu province, i.e., Jolo Island and the neighboring islands of Pata, Marunggas, Tapul, and Lugus, and to a lesser extent in Siasi and Pangutaran (Arce 1963:3). The province of Sulu derives its name from "sulug" or "sug" which in Tausug means "ocean current," while Sulu's capital Jolo is the Spanish corruption of Sulu.
The Tausug speak bahasa sug, a Malayo-Polynesian language related to the Visayan variety spoken in Surigao, and write in a Malayo-Arabic script known as jawi or sulat sug.
Tausug visual arts are represented by carvings, metalworks, woodworks, tapestry and embroidery, mat making and basketry, textile and fashion, pottery, and other minor arts (Szanton 1963). In general, Tausug visual arts follow the Islamic prohibition of representing human or animal forms. Consequently, Mindanao and Sulu have developed ukkil or abstract motifs which are carved, printed, or painted into various media. These motifs are suggestive of leaves, vines, flowers, fruits, and various geometric shapes.
Tausug carving is best exemplified by the sunduk or grave marker. Although not as stylized as those of the Samal, the Tausug sunduk are wood or stone carv-ings of geometric or floral forms. Women's grave mark-ers are flatter with carved geometric designs, those of the men are more floral. Sakayan or outriggers present yet another media for Tausug carving. Adornments are usually made on the prow and sometimes on the sambili or strips across the hull. The carvings are done either on the boat itself, or on a separate piece of wood which is then attached to the vessel. Abstract manok-manok (bird) motifs are the most common. Ajong-ajong/sula-sula are carved tips supporting the wrapped sail; the hidjuk (dark cord) on the sangpad (prow-plate) also serve as decoration. Carved saam or cross--pieces supporting the outriggers are called the mata (eyes) of the boat. Colors used on the finished carvings are yellow, red, green, white, and blue (Szanton 1973:33-47).
Tausug mananasal or blacksmiths produce bolo, kalis, and barong (bladed weapons). Fishing implem-ents are also made, such as the sangkil (single-po-inted spear) and the sapang (three-pronged spear). The more expensively fashioned blades have floral and geometric incisions; the ganja or metal strips which lock the handle and the blade are a decorative as well a functional device. Bronze casting is not as well developed as it is in Lanao. Among the several func-tional pieces produced were the batunjang (standing trays) and the talam (flat trays). Gold and silver-smithing for jewelry remain lucrative. Items produced by the local goldsmith include the singsing (ring), gallang (bracelet), gantung liug (necklace), bang (stud earring), aritis (dangling earring), pin (brooch), and gold teeth. In the past, tambuku (buttons) made of gold or silver decorated the traditional male and female costumes and were made with exquisite de-signs, often inlaid with palmata (semiprecious stones or gems). Among the favorite palmata are mussah (pearl), intan (diamond), kumalah (ruby) (Szanton 1973:47-51; Amilbangsa 1983:142-157).
An example of Tausug woodwork is the puhan (wooden handle) of bladed weapons which may be simple or decorated with gold or silver wires, strings, and rings. For the barong, the handle is wrapped in cord and metal at the far end, and carved and polished at the upper part. At the end of the grip is a protrusion carved with ukkil designs. The handle of the kalis, which the Tausug terms as daganan kalis, can also be profusely decorated, sometimes with mother-of-pearl. Taguban (scabbards) are beautifully carved and are covered with budbud (fine rattan). Other woodworks include kitchen utensils and furniture items like beds, chests, and wardrobes (Szanton 1973:51-54).
There are two types of tapestries that the Tausug use to hang as house decoration: the luhul or canopy that hangs from the ceiling, and the kikitil/buras or wall tapestry. The ukkil design used for both is first traced on a starched white cloth which is then cut and sewn over a red, green, yellow, or blue background material. The ukkil design of the luhul, for example, is in the form of a tree with spreading leaves, vines, flowers, and branches. About 1 m wide, the kikitil is a smaller version of the luhul and is hung on the wall. The size of the room determines the length of the kikitil which is divided into various units correspond-ing to individualized panels. The ukkil design may be similar in all units.
Embroidery, another Tausug visual art form, is used to ornament table cloth, pillow cases, bed spreads, and the habul tiyahian (embroidered tube). The brightest silk thread is often used for the habul to underscore the design, which follows the ukkil pattern.
Used as bedding or underbedding, baluy or mats are usually made from pandanus. Double layering pro-vides decoration and color; a simple base mat is sewn under a colored panel which has been dyed with one or more colors. The designs the Tausug usually adopt are the geometric patterns found on the pis siabit (male headgear) or the plaid known as baluy palang. Mat designs are memorized and passed on to the next generation.
The Tausug male hat is made by weaving nito with bamboo strips over nipa leaves. Thus it is three-layered and woven in a sawali pattern. Structure and form are provided by the nipa leaves and the light bamboo frame, while texture and feel are supplied by the nito strips. The open-weave layer assures ventila-tion inside. Another example of Tausug basketry is the small nito container, 18-20 cm in diameter, used either as a coin or as a personal basket. If used as a personal basket, it comes with cover and handle. As a coin basket, it is supplied with a loop to allow it to be carried on a finger. A slit serves as the coin slot. Aniline dyes-magenta, blue, violet, and green-color the nito strips (Lane 1986:193-194).
Hablun or textile weaving is another well-known art form among the Tausug. The most popular woven material is the pis siabit or male headgear, which is about 1 sqm in size and distinct for its geometric de-signs. Because of its intricacy, one pis takes about three to four weeks of work. Only women weave the pis and other materials such as the kambut (sash) and kandit (loincloth and sash), which unfortunately have completely disappeared (Szanton 1973:6.4-65).
The female biyatawi is a blouse made of plain material like satin and is ornamented with tambuku (gold or silver buttons) on the breast, shoulders, and cuffs. It is usually worn with sawwal (loose trousers) of silk or brocade. A habul tiyahian is either slung across the shoulder or allowed to hang on one arm (Amilbangsa 1983:76-113).
The patadjung is an all-purpose skirt worn by both men and women. It has various other uses: as a turung or headcover, sash or waistband, blanket, ham-mock, and others. Resembling a big pillow case, the cloth for a patadjung has designs which are variously inspired: batik prints from Indonesia and Malaysia, checks and stripes from India, dunggala or stylized geometrical and floral patterns from Sarawak, Indone-sia, or Malaysia, calligraphic motifs from the Middle East (Amilbangsa 1983:82).
Tausug men wear the sawwal kuput or sawwal kantiyu (tight and loose trousers respectively), and match this with the badju lapi, a collarless short-tailored jacket similar to the biyatawi. The sleeves of the badju lapi are either long or "three-fourth's" with slits at the wrists. The badju lapi is likewise ornamented with tambuku on the breast, shoulders, and cuffs. The legs of the sawwal kaput are skin-tight down to the ankles, and have 22.5 cm slits on each side, which are also decorated with buttons. A kandit (handwoven or embroidered sash) tied around the waist serves to keep the sawwal kuput in place. A pis siabit is either tied around the head or left to hang on the shoulder (Amilbangsa 1983:114-130).
Function and simplicity define Tausug pottery. Decorations are limited to simple geometric lines as the emphasis has always been on the quantity not quality of the product. Examples include pots, vases, jugs, and various pieces of kitchenware (Szanton 1973: 61-63).
Tutup or plate covers are made by Tausug men and women; smaller pieces are called turung dulang riki-riki, and are used as wall adornment. Tutup mea-sure about 75 cm in diameter and are made of coconut leaves inside, and silal or buri leaves outside. Colored pandan leaves are sewn on the exterior and serve as decoration (Szanton 1973:64).
Calligraphy is found printed or carved on doors and gates, as well as on tapestries. Musical instruments, especially the gabbang (native xylophone), are also decorated by the Tausug (Szanton 1973:65).
Various musical instruments, played solo or as an ensemble, provide the Tausug with music. Most notab-le is the kulintangan ensemble consisting of two gandang (drums), a tungallan (large gong), a duwahan (set of two-paired gongs), and the kulintangan (a graduated series of 8 to 11 small gongs). At least five players are needed to play the ensemble which is used to accompany dances or provide music during celebra-tions (Kiefer 1970:2).
Other popular instruments are the gabbang (na-tive xylophone) and the biyula (native violin). With 14 to 24 keys divided into seven-note scales, the gabbang has become the most popular musical instrument in Sulu. It is used to accompany Tausug vocal music such as the sindil. The tune produced when the gabbang is played solo by a man or woman is called tahtah.
The biyula is similar to but larger than the western violin. It consists of four strings played by a bow made of horsehair. Traditionally played by men, the biyula, with the gabbang, accompany the sindil (Kiefer 1970:2)
Flute music is associated with peace and travel. It represented by the following less popular instruments: the saunay (reed flute), suling (bamboo flute), and kulaing (jaw harp). The saunay is essentially a six-holed slender bamboo, 1.5 mm in diameter, capped by a sampung simud (mouthguard). A resonating chamber made of palm leaves is housed in the mouthguard. The suling is a larger version of the saunay. It is a 60-cm long bamboo with a 2-cm diameter. Like the saunay, it has six fingerholes (Kiefer 1970:4).
The repertoire for Tausug instrumental music in-clude: the gabbang tahtah (gabbang with biyula accompaniment); the kasi-lasa, lugu, and tahtah (biyula songs); the sinug kiadtu-kari (kulintangan); the tiawag kasi (saunay music), the tahtah (suling music); and others (Kiefer 1970).
Kalangan or Tausug vocal music can be divided into narrative and lyric songs, and further into the lugu and the paggabang traditions. The luguh traditio-n denotes unaccompanied religious songs, while the paggabang tradition applies to "more mundane" songs that are accompanied by the gabbang and biyula (Trimillos 1972).
Narrative songs tell a story and include all the sung kissa like the parang sabil. Lyric songs express ideas and feelings and consist of the langan batabata (children's songs), the baat (occupational songs), the baat caallaw and pangantin (funeral and bridal songs, respectively), the tarasul (sung poems), the sindil (sung verbal jousts), the liangkit (from langkit or "chained"), and the sangbay or song to accompany the dalling-dalling dance.
The langan batabata are more specifically lulla-bies. They have a soft and relaxing melody (Tuban 1977:210). Baat and kalangan are the same, the latter being the more general term to refer to singing. The baat taallaw have a melancholic melody. The baat pangantin are also known as langan pangantin. With a soothing melody, they are used to reassure a bride and to console a friend (Rixhon 1974a:51).
The sindil (sung verbal jousts) belong to the gabbang tradition and are performed by both sexes conducting an extemporaneous battle of wits. Teasing, jokes, and innuendos flow into the verses, the better ones applauded by the audience (Kiefer 1970: 10).
The liangkit are long solo pieces accompanied by the gabbang and biyula. Unlike the sindil, they are not performed extemporaneously. The subject of the liangkit is wide-love, war, nature, and others. The Tausug lelling, adopted from the Samal, are part of the liangkit tradition, but are sung to the music provided by a guitar. They relate and comment on current events. One good ex-ample is the lelling narrating the entry of the Moro National Liberation Front forces into Jolo town in February 1974.
The art of singing to the dalling-dalling dance is called pagsangbay. The song usually dictates the movement that the dancers should follow.
The lugu or sail tradition is associated with reli-gious rituals and rites of the life cycle such as wed-dings, births, paggunting, pagtammat, and funerals. It is characterized by dahig or jugjug (high vocal ten-sion). The tempo is slow with long sustained and stressed tones. Although usually performed by women, the lugu can also be sung by men (Trimillos 1974).
The most well-known dance of the Tausug is the pangalay. It is the basic style from which the move-ments of various dances in Sulu and Tawi-Tawi are derived. The pangalay is danced by either sex, alone or together, and is usually accompanied by the kulintang ensemble. The movement of the pangalay is concen-trated on the thighs, knees, ankles, toes, waist, shoulders, neck, elbows, wrists, and fingers. The torso is usually kept rigid, moving upward or downward as the flow of the dance demands. The feet is firmly planted on the ground and move in small shuffling steps (Amilbangsa 1983:14, 62).
The pangalay dances are distinctive in their use of the janggay (metal nail extenders) to underscore hand movements. The extended fingers are stiff and set apart from the thumbs.
Another well-known Tausug dance is the dalling--dalling, where handkerchiefs or fans are used. A sing-er usually accompanies the dance by describing the various movements of the dancer. The song is known as the sangbay and the singing. pagsangbay. Some of the songs used are "Lingisan/kinjung-kinjung," "Dalling-dalling." The development of the dalling--dalling is attributed to a native Tausug by the name of Albani who became a famous proponent of the dance (Amilbangsa 1983:42).
Tausug martial-art dances are performed by men and include the langka-silat and the langka-kuntaw. The langka-silat simulates a fight and is usually per-formed with two or three other dancers. The langka--kuntaw is a dance of self-defense, resembling the mar-tial arts of China, Japan, and Burma (Amilbangsa 1983:32-35).
A Tausug occupational dance is the linggisan which depicts a bird in flight; the taute, which shows a fisher diving for the prickly catfish; and the suwa--suwa, which shows dancers imitating the swaying of lemon trees (Amilbangsa 1983:28).
Chavacano.
Chavacano, also variously known as ZamboangueÃ±o, has been known for quite to be both a Spanish-based creole language and a Filipino tribe born officially on June 23, 1635. It is also one of the six dialects of the Chavacano Language. some of which like the Viasayan Chavacano, have already died off just a few years after the surrender of the Spanish. Chabacano in Luzon stayed on a little longer. These are found in the Ermita district of Manila (Spanish Criollo), Cavite (Spanish and Tagalog) and Ternate (Spanish-Portuguese and Tagalog). These Chavacano speakers, were decimated during the Japanese occupation, easy targets because of their lighter skin and obviously Western tongue.
The Chavacanos de Zamboanga o ZamboangueÃ±o Chavacano, however, are rooted in the Spanish-Jesuit settlement that grew around Fuerte de San Jose established in 1635. The ZamboangueÃ±o Chavacano of today is the result of centuries of cultural interaction and intermarriage between and among three (3) main racial/ethnic groups: (1) Visayan, specifically the original 1,000 Cebuanos brought in from Cebu to build the Spanish fortress (as well as the many Cebuanos and Ilongos who followed soon after), (2) the Christianized natives, mostly Subanen, Tau Laut (Samal) and Yakan converted and tended to by the enterprising Jesuits; and (3) Castilians (Spaniards, Mexicans and Peruvians). Later infusions by Chavacanos from Cavite/Ternate, Ilocanos and Tagalogs further enriched Chavacano culture. 
Of all these, the Spanish culture had the strongest impact â about 80% of Chavacano culture is anchored on EspaÃ±a and its three centuries of presence. The greatest number of ZamboangueÃ±o profess the Catholic faith, hewing closely to their avowedly Hispanic heritage.[http://www.zamboanga.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=206&Itemid=28]
The Chavacano inhabit the northern coasts of the island, mostly residing in the urban centers of Isabela and Lamitan cities, they are joined by other Christian tribes in these areas, usually the Bisaya Sugbuhanon (Cebuano), Ilonggo, Ilocano and Tagalog. They own most of the agricultural lands on the island, and is the group with the highest literacy, highest per capita incomes, and lowest poverty incidence on the island.
Chavacano customs are based on Spanish and European notions of patriarchal authority, etiquette, familial obligation, as well as a feeling of superiority - characterized by excessive pride, vanity, jealousy, boastfulness, and snobbishness - over their less-Westernized neighbors. They are mostly devout Roman Catholics.
Chavacano courtship traditions are elaborate and regulated by a long list of required social graces. For example, a perfectly respectable Chavacano gentleman would not sit unless permitted to do so by the womanâs parents, he then had to endure questions pertaining to his lineage, credentials, and occupation. Finally, the courtship curfew, and the need to cultivate the goodwill of all the members of the womanâs family were paramount considerations before any headway could be made in pursuing a Chavacano senorita's hand in marriage.
Chavacano songs and dances are derived primarily from Spanish/Iberian performances. Specifically, the Jota Zamboanguena, a Chavacano version of the quick-stepping flamenco with bamboo clappers in lieu of Spanish castanets, are regularly presented during fiestas and formal "tertulias" or other Chavacano festivities. 
Likewise, Chavacano traditional costumes are closely associated with Spanish formal dress. Men wear close-necked jackets, "de baston" pants, and European style shoes, complete with the de rigueur "bigotillos" (mustache). More recently, Chavacano men have adapted to wearing the formal Barong Tagalog, worn by men throughout the Philippines. Chavacano women claim ownership of the "mascota", a formal gown with a fitting bodice, her shoulders draped demurely by a luxuriously embroidered, though stiff, panuelo and fastened at the breast by a brooch or a medal. The skirt tapers down from the waist but continues on to an extended trail called the "cola". The "cola may be held on one hand as the lady walks around, or it may likewise by pinned on the waist or slipped up a cord (belt) that holds the dainty "abanico" or purse.
Of late, the Chavacanos de Basilan have acquired more modern tastes in food, clothing and customs, usually based on the generally preferred American/Western model. The traditional ZamboangueÃ±o dress has been limited to formal functions, replaced by the more common shirt, denim jeans and sneakers for men, and shirts, blouses, skirts or pants, and heeled shoes for women. Likewise, Taglish, a mix of Tagalog and English is increasingly accepted as a modern and convenient variant of either the more difficult (for Chavacanos) Tagalog or the more formal English. An even more confusing mix of Tag-lish and Chavacano is likewise spoken especially by the younger generations of Chavacanos.

GreeceâItaly relations

Greco-Italian relations refer to bilateral foreign relations between Greece and Italy. Due to the strong historical friendship and the deep cultural ties between the two nations, Greece and Italy enjoy excellent diplomatic relations. More than two millennia of shared heritage and Greco-Italian relations strengthened the bonds between the two countries, which today are regarded as perfect and have led to the Italian language political statement "Una Faccia Una Razza" (One Face, One Race). Both countries are members of many international organizations, including the European Union, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and NATO, cooperate in many fields and share common political views about the Balkans, and the world. Greece and Italy are leading supporters of the intergration of the Western Balkan states to the Euro-Atlantic family.
History.
Due to the strong cultural and historical ties between the two nations, from ancient to modern times (Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome laid the foundations of the Western Civilization and the common heritage strengthened further the bonds between the two nations), Greece and Italy today enjoy excellent diplomatic relations and consider each other a brother nation. In modern times, both countries established diplomatic relations in 1861, immediately upon Italyâs unification. Today, many Greeks live in Italy and many Italians live in Greece.
Overview.
Greece has an embassy in Rome, 2 general consulates in Milan and Naples, a consulate in Venice, and 11 honorary consulates in Trieste (General), Turin (General), Ancona, Catania, Livorno, Bari, Bologna, Brindisi, Florence, Palermo, Perugia, and a Port Consulate in Genova.
Italy has an embassy in Athens, and 15 honorary consulates in Alexandroupoli, Kefalonia, Chania, Chios, Corfu, Corinth, Ioannina, Heraklion, Kavala, Larissa, Patras, Rhodes, Thessaloniki, Santorini, and Volos.
Bilateral relations & cooperation.
The 20th century relations were difficult during the inter war period (Corfu incident, the occupation of the Dodecanese) and being enemies during World War II (Greco-Italian War). The after war period saw much better relations, until now relations are excellent, due to the common interests and shared heritage of both countries.
Both countries are full members of many international organizations, including NATO, the European Union, the Council of Europe, the OECD and the Union for the Mediterranean. Greece is one of Italy's main trade partners and both states are co-operating in many fields, including judicial, scientific and educational, and on mutual tourism development, as both countries have a heavy industry in tourism. There are regular high-level visits between the two countries, and frequent contacts between the two countries ministries and agencies on various matters concerning individual sectors. Big projects currently in running between the two countries include the GreeceâItaly pipeline (which is part of the Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy pipeline (ITGI)), and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP).
Transportation.
The Italian port cities of Bari, Brindisi, Ancona, Venice and Triest in the Adriatic Sea's Italian coast are connected in an every day basis via passenger Ferries and Freight Ferries, with the Greek port cities of Corfu, Patras, Igoumenitsa and Kalamata, allowing for better transport times by skipping the Balkan peninsula.

Klincewicz method

In thermodynamic theory, the Klincewicz method is a predictive method based both on group contributions and on a correlation with some basic molecular properties. The method estimates the critical temperature, the critical pressure, and the critical volume of pure components.
Model description.
As a group contribution method the Klincewicz method correlates some structural information of a chemical molecule with the critical data. The used structural information are small functional groups which are assumed to have no interactions. This assumption makes it possible to calculate the thermodynamic properties directly from the sums of the group contributions. The correlation method does not even use these functional groups, only the molecular weight and the number of atoms are used as molecular descriptors.
The prediction of the critical temperature relies on the knowledge of the normal boiling point because the method only predicts the relation of the normal boiling point and the critical temperature and not directly the critical temperature. The critical volume and pressure however are directly predicted.
Model Quality.
The quality of the Klincewicz method is not superior to older methods, especially the method of Ambrose gives somewhat better results as stated by the original authors and by Reid et al. The advantage of the Klincewicz method is that it is less complex.
The quality and complexity of the Klincewicz method is comparable to the Lydersen method from 1955 which has been used widely in chemical engineering.
The aspect where the Klincewicz method is unique and useful are the alternative equations where only very basic molecular data like the molecular weight and the atom count are used.
Deviation diagrams.
The diagrams show estimated critical data of hydrocarbons together with experimental data. An estimation would be perfect if all data points would lie directly on the diagonal line. Only the simple correlation of the Klincewicz method with the moelcular weight and the atom count have been used in this example.
Equations.
Klincewicz published two sets of equations. The first uses contributions of 35 different groups. These group contribution based equations are giving somewhat better results than the very simple equations based only on correlations with the molecular weight and the atom count.

GreeceâNorway relations

GreeceâNorway relations are foreign relations between Greece and Norway. The Greek Embassy in Oslo opened in 1980 and the Norwegian Embassy in Athens opened in 1974.
Greece's embassy in Oslo (since 1980) and an honorary consulate in Bergen represents Greece diplomatically in Norway. Norway has an embassy in Athens, and six honorary consulates in Piraeus, Patras, Corfu, Crete, Rhodes and Thessaloniki. Both countries are members of NATO.
Agreements.
The two countries have signed the Treaty on Social Security (1980), a Treaty on Cultural Agreement (1976), and an Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation (1988).
Tourism.
Greece, which ranks very high on the list of Norwegian tourist preferences, is amongst the top contenders, welcoming about 22% of the tourist population, which is estimated at some 250,000 people throughout the year. The tourist traffic flows from Norway to Greece in recent years have been increasing and Greece is a favorite destination for Norwegians. According to the Greek Statistical Service the number of Norwegians who visited Greece in 2002 came to 181,383 and in 2003 to 230,232. The island of Antiparos has often been described as the "Norwegian island" because here is more Norwegian tourists than any other tourists without Greeks.
Economic relations.
Through the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA), Norway is a part of EUâs Internal Market, and in addition has incorporated EU legislation to ensure that the âFour Freedomsâ governing the EU/EEA Internal Market (i.e. free movement of goods, persons, capital, services), are being observed.
As part of the EEA Agreement, Norway with the two other EFTA States have established the EEA Financial Mechanisms in order to contribute to the reduction of economic and social disparities within the European Economic Area
Since 2001, Greek exports to Norway have increased in pharmaceuticals, cotton, clothing, non-ferrous metals, plastics, steel products, and fresh fruit and in 2003 amounted to some NOK 430 million (â¬52, 800, 000 approximately). Norway exports fishery products, maritime equipment, aluminium alloys, and granite, which in 2003 amounted to about NOK 970 million. Norwegian exports to Greece amount to approximately NOK 1,2 billion per year. Norway enjoys a large surplus of trade as the imports from Greece remain at just over NOK 400 million per year. Although trade between Greece and Norway has shown a slight decrease in the last three years, efforts are being made to boost trade and investment. The processes and projects associated with the implementation and strengthening of the EEA Mechanisms should bring more interaction between Greece and Norway, especially when it comes to the business sector.
The sectors that are of particular interest to Norwegian exporters are Seafood, Environmental Technology and Alternative Energy as well as Shipping and Ship-Building. There has been a long shipping tradition between Greece and Norway and ships are sold and bought between the two countries frequently. Norwegian companies sell catamarans and other vessels as well as technological equipment to their Greek counterparts. Norwegian maritime exporters participate at POSEIDONIA Exhibition held in Greece and further development of relations with the Greek shipping industry in order to increase Norwegian shipping exports is desirable.
The value of direct Norwegian investments in Greece came to NOK 1,006 million at the end of 2002 â an important increase compared with previous years (2001: 605, 2000: 864, 1998: NOK 352 million). 
In general, Norway promotes its expertise and strength in Building and Construction, Consumer Goods, ICT, Maritime Industry, Oil and Gas, Process Industry, Environmental Technology, Seafood, and Services.
Ambassadors.
The Norwegian ambassadors to Greece:
Immigration.
The Greek community in Norway consists of 1,671 individuals in 2009, up from 1,572 in 2008. The majority are established in Oslo and Bergen more or less permanently. An overwhelming majority have created family ties, by marrying Norwegian nationals. Hordaland has the highest number of Greek pupils in the country, 8 of 11.
The Greek Orthodox Church in Norway.
The congregation was founded in 1965 with main purpose to serve the Greek-speaking Greek Orthodox in Norway. Church fall under Metropolita Pavlos Menevissoglou of Sweden and Scandinavia, based in Stockholm. Parish priest Archimandrite Evmenios Likakis and others. There is one Greek Orthodox church in Norway (in Oslo). There is also a small congregation in Bergen with 98 members, St. Michael's Orthodox Church.

Duncan v. Kahanamoku

Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U.S. 304 (1946), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court. It is often associated with the Japanese exclusion cases ("Hirabayashi v. United States", "Korematsu v. United States" and "Ex parte Endo") because it involved wartime curtailment of fundamental civil liberties under the aegis of military authority.
While Duke Kahanamoku was a military police officer during World War II, he arrested Duncan for public intoxication. At the time, Hawaii, not yet a state, was being administered under martial law instituted in the islands after the December 7, 1941 Pearl Harbor attack. Duncan was therefore tried by a military tribunal and appealed to the Supreme Court. The court ruled that trial by military tribunal was, in this case, unconstitutional.

In February 2002, she became the youngest girl ever to qualify for the lottery funded Junior Olympic Programme, when she took bronze in the Junior girls platform event at the British Championships.
It was at that point that her talent on the platform was really recognized.
There have been many ups and downs in Toniaâs career. Competition for spots on international teams in the Women's Platform event within Great Britain is fierce and Tonia has had her fair share of disappointments, however she always bounces back and becomes even stronger and without doubt, her two greatest triumphs have been on the greatest stages of all.

George William Scott Blair (1902â1987) was British chemist noted for his contributions to rheology. In fact he has been called "the first rheologist"
Life.
Scott Blair was born 23 July 1902, in Weybridge UK and went to Winchester College. He studied chemistry at Trinity College, Oxford receiving a BA in 1923.
He began work as a colloid chemist, studying flour suspensions which led to a series of papers on baker's dough. In 1926 he joined the Rothamsted Experimental Station, where the focus was on soil science. In 1928 he married Rita, who survived him. 
In December 1929 Scott Blair attended the founding meeting of the "Society of Rheology" in Washington, D.C. Chemist Eugene C. Bingham led the new society concerned with the problems of flow. Scott Blair held a Rockefeller Fellowship at the time. In 1931 Markus Reiner visited Scott Blair in England beginning a long friendship.
In 1937 he became Head of the Chemistry Department (and later headed the Physics Department as well) at the National Institute for Research in Dairying, at Shinfield near Reading until his retirement in 1967. He died in 1987.
Work.
His contribution to food science was celebrated in a special edition of the Journal of Texture Studies He also initiated what he called psycho-rheology: the effect of food texture on the consumer. However he promoted and was a major contributor to the study of the rheological effects in blood flow to the genitalia, as well as biological systems in general. The journal "Biorheology", which he co-founded, published an obituary. His contribution to medical science was recognised in his obituary in the journal "Thrombosis Research".

Apostolic Vicariate of the Congo

The Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of the Congo, the administrative region covering Catholic mission activity in the Congo area of Central Africa, was by the end of the nineteenth century already fragmented.
The first vicar apostolic appointed for Congo was in 1518, and the intended territory was within modern northern Angola.
Over a period of about eighty years, from 1880, the territory of the present Democratic Republic of Congo became divided into dioceses with their bishops, with apostolic vicariates being the intermediate stage.
Early missions.
The evangelization of the Congo began as early as 1484, when Diogo Cam discovered the mouth of the Congo River, known as Zaire until the seventeenth century. Cam's naval chaplain set himself at once to preach to the natives, and won to Christianity the chief of the Sogno, a village on the right bank of the Congo, where he first landed. Some of the inhabitants of this village accompanied Cam on his return voyage and were solemnly baptized at the court of John II of Portugal. 
Later, the head chief of the Banza-Congo (Outeiro, the present San Salvador) asked King John for missionaries. Three were sent (whether they were Dominicans or Franciscans or members of a Lisbon chapter isn't known know); they finally baptized the head chief and many other subordinate ones at Banza-Congo, in a wooden structure called the Church of the Holy Cross. In 1518, a grandson of this chief, known as Henry, who had been ordained in Portugal, was made titular bishop of Utica, and appointed by Leo X Vicar Apostolic of Congo. He died before quitting Europe. 
From the beginning the Portuguese undertook to introduce Portuguese customs in Congo. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, a native chief, Alvarez II, sent one of his relatives, a marquis, as his representative to the papal court. The ambassador arrived in Rome in a dying condition, and expired the day after his arrival, the eve of the Epiphany, 1608. Pope Paul V, who personally assisted the ambassador in his last moments, gave him a magnificent state funeral, and erected to his memory a monument at St. Mary Major's. Later, Pope Urban VIII had a mausoleum erected to him by Bernini; it still stands at the entrance to the choir of the basilica. 
The Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, and Jesuits were the first missionaries of the Congo. Their labours were trying, and rather fruitless. In the seventeenth century, the Jesuits had two colleges, one at Loanda, another, of minor importance, at San Salvador. On the whole, Christianity never took firm root, and was early brought into discredit by the slave-trading Portuguese. While the Portuguese always confined themselves to the Lower Congo, as early as the seventeenth century the missionaries had traversed the course of the Zaire, and a seventeenth-century map has been discovered which traces the river according to data supplied by them.

Galeb (yacht)

Yugoslav Navy (JRM) Yacht "Galeb", also known as The Peace Ship "Galeb" ("Brod Mira"), was used by the late President of the Yugoslav Republic Marshal Josip Broz Tito on his numerous foreign trips and to entertain heads of state, as well as other persons of worldwide renown. The ship attained an iconic status among the peoples of Yugoslavia, as well as among the many diverse nations and members of the Non-Aligned Movement. "Galeb" is Serbo-Croatian for "seagull" (the "Laridae" family).
History.
"Galeb" started its tumultuous career in 1938 in Genoa, where it was built as a banana-boat "Ramb III". After the armistice in 1943, it was taken over by the Germans and they turned it into an auxiliary cruiser under the name "Kiebitz". While she was in Rijeka, it was sunk on 25 November 1944 by allied aircraft. "Brodospas" (SHIPSAVING) from Split, raised "Kiebitz" in 1948, after which it was taken to the Pula ship building company Uljanik where in 1952 it was reconstructed as a school ship of the Yugoslav Navy under the new name "Galeb". Tito embarked on it the first time in 1952 in Podgora, where he conducted an inspection of the boats in the YWN from the deck of the ship. In the next 27 years "Galeb" was in Titoâs service for a total of 549 days, of which, for 318 days, the Marshal was on board, sailing over the Adriatic and other seas on political missions. By Titoâs death, 102 world statesmen had stayed on "Galeb".
"Galeb" was 117 metres long and 15 m wide with a displacement of 5,754 tonnes. With the speed of it was powered by two Fiat diesel engines of 7,200 horsepower in total. The Italians, at one point, offered to SFRJ to remove them and exhibit them in the Fiat museum in Torino. In return, they offered to build an entirely new, modern, school ship, but the Yugoslavs declined.
The yacht first came to international attention in 1953 when Tito sailed up the Thames to meet Winston Churchill on the first visit to United Kingdom of a communist head of state. He was greeted on board by the Duke of Edinburgh. During the trip, the ship was to dock at Malta, but was prevented from doing so by the nation's governor.
Tito loved the glamour the yacht conferred on his regime. He used it for parties, foreign visits and diplomacy. World leaders entertained there included Nikita Khrushchev, Gaddafi and Indira Gandhi. Tito was particularly excited to welcome Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, who played Tito in the 1973 war epic "Sutjeska".
"Galeb" belonged to Marshall Tito from 1948 till his death in 1980 when the yacht became the property of the Montenegrin government following the nation's breakup in 1991. It was sold to John Paul Papanicolaou, the same Greek yachtsman who owns the yacht "Christina O". It is currently moored on the quayside of the Viktor Lenac Shipyard in Kostrena, a suburb of Rijeka. The Croatian authorities placed a preservation order on the ship and hope to turn it into a museum if they secure ownership at the auction. In September 2008 the boat partially sank on its right side after a leak developed in its hull.
On 22 May 2009, the ship was sold to city of Rijeka for US$150,000. The City of Rijeka plans to use the ship as a museum.
On 30 October 2009, the High Mercantile Court of Croatia confirmed the verdict of the Regional Mercantile Court in which the ownership of "Galeb" was awarded to the City of Rijeka.

Diocese of Clogher (Church of Ireland)

The Diocese of Clogher is a diocese of the Church of Ireland in the north of Ireland. It is in the ecclesiastical province of Armagh. It covers a rural area on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland including much of south west Ulster, taking in most of counties Fermanagh and Monaghan and parts of counties Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal.
The diocese has two diocesan cathedrals, St Macartan's Cathedral, Clogher and St Macartin's Cathedral, Enniskillen, yet having a single Dean and Chapter between them.
Overview and history.
The Diocese was formed in 1111 at the Synod of Rathbreasail as the see for the Kingdom of UÃ­ Chremthainn. The See was removed to Louth between 1135 and 1197, possibly to consolidate the power of the Bishop over against smaller Sees, before being returned to Clougher. At this time Louth was moved to the Diocese of Armagh, and the Ardstraw part of the diocese given to the Diocese of Derry. Church property that existed at the time of the Reformation, buildings included, was retained by the reformed Church of Ireland, then in the 19th century, at the time of the Disestablishment of the Church, confiscated by the state. Schools, churches and cathedrals were however returned to the Church. The diocese is unique within the Anglican Communion in having two diocesan cathedrals.
During the 18th century Clogher was one of the "Bishopâs boroughs" of the Parliament of Ireland where the Bishop of the Diocese awarded the parliamentary seat as a gift.
List of the Bishops of Clogher.
The following is a basic list of the post-Reformation Church of Ireland bishops.
In 1850, Clogher was united with Armagh.
In 1886, Clogher was separated from Armagh.

Go-Ahead London

Go-Ahead London is the trading name used collectively for the London bus operations of the Go-Ahead Group. The name first appeared in August 2008, before which the company had traded under separate names and brands. It is the largest bus operator in London, operating a total of 115 bus routes under contract to Transport for London.
History.
The Go-Ahead Group is a large transport group based in Newcastle. It first became involved in London bus operations in September 1994, where upon the privatisation of London Buses it purchased London Central. In May 1996, it added another former London Buses subsidiary, London General, which had been sold in 1994 to a management buy out. These two companies subsequently developed in much the same way, both establishing a livery of red with a charcoal skirt and yellow relief band, and splitting orders for new buses.
Further expansion did not occur until September 2006, when Docklands Buses was purchased. On 29 June 2007, the Go-Ahead purchased Blue Triangle. With these purchases, Go-Ahead surpassed Arriva London to become the largest operator of buses in London, running around 16% of London bus services.
A corporate image for Go-Ahead's London bus services started to appear in August 2008, when a new Go-Ahead London logo was unveiled.
In 2009, Transport for London invited bids for the sale of their own bus operations which ran under the East Thames Buses brand. Go-Ahead London were selected as the preferred bidder and assumed full responsibility for 10 routes and two depots in October 2009. The East Thames brand was replaced with the Go-Ahead London brand. The East Thames operations were initially absorbed under the London General arm of Go-Ahead's London business. However, after some route movements and allocation changes some of the services now run under the London Central.
On 30 March 2012, Go-Ahead purchased Northumberland Park Garage from First London with all routes brought under the London General wing.

Aberdeen Corporation Tramways

Aberdeen Corporation Tramways formerly served the City of Aberdeen, Scotland.
The system.
The city's tram system was the most northerly municipal tramway in the United Kingdom. The system was electrified, with trams using the standard trolley poles until 1935 when bow collectors were fitted to take power from the overhead wires. The trams were double deck and painted in a dark green and cream livery, often with the words "CORPORATION TRANSPORT" painted prominently on the sides. 
In the late 1930s the city purchased 18 trams from Nottingham Corporation Tramways, which closed in 1936. Further secondhand trams were later obtained from Manchester. The last new trams for the city were built by R Y Pickering of Wishaw in 1949.
The city's best known service was route 1, from Bridge of Don to Bridge of Dee. The city's last tram operated on 3 May 1958, being replaced by diesel buses.
The tram system was supported by 14 bus routes numbered No. 4, No. 8 and No. 11 through to No. 22, No. 4 being an extension of the No. 4 tram route.
Television studios.
The former tram depot at Queen's Cross was purchased by Grampian Television in 1960 and was converted into their television studios and headquarters. In 2003 Grampian Television relocated their studios and offices to new premises; the former tram depot was subsequently demolished and new flats built on the site.
Successors.
Following the closure of the tram system, Aberdeen Corporation continued to operate buses. Following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, the fleet passed to the new Grampian Regional Council in 1975, becoming Grampian Regional Transport. The dark green and cream livery was retained. Following the Transport Act 1985 the company was subsequently privatised, becoming the GRT Group, which later became First Group. As of 2009, buses in Aberdeen are operated by First Aberdeen.

Mormon Row Historic District

Mormon Row is a line of homestead complexes along the Jackson-Moran Road near the southeast corner of Grand Teton National Park, in the valley called Jackson Hole. The rural historic landscape's period of significance includes the construction of the Andy Chambers, T.A. Moulton and John Moulton farms from 1908 to the 1950s. Six building clusters and a separate ruin illustrate Mormon settlement in the area and comprise such features as drainage systems, barns, fields and corrals. Apart from John and T.A. Moulton, other settlers in the area were Joseph Eggleston, Albert Gunther, Henry May, Thomas Murphy and George Riniker.
The area is also known as Antelope Flats, situated between the towns of Moose and Kelly. It is a popular destination for tourists and photographers on account of the historic buildings, the herds of bison, and the spectacular Teton Range rising in the background. The alluvial soil to the east of Blacktail Butte was more suitable than most locations in Jackson Hole for farming, somewhat hampered by a lack of readily available water. The Mormon homesteaders began to arrive in the 1890s from Idaho, creating a community called "Gros Ventre", with a total of 27 homesteads. The Mormon settlers tended to create clustered communities, in contrast to the isolated homesteads more typical of Jackson Hole.
Mormon Row was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

Brillstein Entertainment Partners

Brillstein Entertainment Partners (formerly known as Brillstein-Grey Entertainment and Brillstein-Grey Communications) is a talent management film and television production company formed by the 1991 addition of Brad Grey to The Brillstein Company, founded by Bernie Brillstein in 1969.
The Brillstein Company.
Bernie Brillstein formed The Brillstein Company in 1969. There, he continued to manage stars and develop television programming, a career he began in the fabled mailroom of the William Morris Agency. He produced such popular television hits as "Hee Haw", "The Muppet Show" and "Saturday Night Live."
Brillstein managed Saturday Night Live cast members Gilda Radner, John Belushi and Lorne Michaels, as well as Jim Henson (of Muppets fame) and Paul Fusco (voice and operator of "ALF"). Productions for television included "", and "Normal Life."
The company became Brillstein Entertainment Partners when Brad Grey left the company to become head of Paramount studios. It is now headed by Jonathan Liebman, Marc Gurvitz, and Cynthia Pett.
Brillstein-Grey Entertainment.
In 1984, Brillstein met Brad Grey at a television convention in San Francisco, California. In 1986, the two formed a production company, Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, which packaged programming and managed talent.
Client List.
The company is largely regarded as the premier entertainment management group in the world by many within the industry. Brillstein Entertainment Partners represents stars such as Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, Orlando Bloom, Paul Rudd, Adam Sandler, Brendan Fraser, Natalie Portman, Mark Ruffalo, ChloÃ« Sevigny, Timothy Olyphant, Aaron Johnson, Zach Galifianakis, Bill Maher, Courteney Cox, Anton Yelchin, Anna Paquin, Epic Meal Time, Charlie Hunnam, Norm Macdonald, James Maslow and many others.
Miscellaneous.
The new management company Eric Murphy joins in HBO's "Entourage" is based on Brillstein Entertainment, as well as the character Murray Berenson based on the company's founder Bernie Brillstein.
Brillstein sold his shares in the company to Grey, his one time protÃ©gÃ©, in 1996, giving Grey full rein over operations; the company's television unit was subsequently rechristened Brad Grey Television. Grey sold his interest in the company in 2005 due to his succeeding Sherry Lansing as Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures, which created a conflict of interest.
Several shows by the company now have ancillary rights owned by NBC Universal Television. Some of these shows are owned by Sony Pictures Television in North America.

Diocese of Derry and Raphoe

The Diocese of Derry and Raphoe is a diocese of the Church of Ireland in Ulster located in the north of Ireland. It is in the ecclesiastical province of Armagh. Its geographical remit covers County Londonderry (in Northern Ireland) and County Donegal (in the Republic of Ireland).
Overview and history.
When the Church in England broke communion with the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England was established by the state as the established church. Later, by decree of the Irish Parliament, a similar new body became the State Church in the Kingdom of Ireland. It assumed possession of most Church property (and so retained a great repository of religious architecture and other items, though some were later destroyed). The substantial majority of the population remained faithful to the Latin Rite of Roman Catholicism, despite the political and economic advantages of membership in the state church. They were obliged to find alternative premises and to conduct their services in secret. The English-speaking minority mostly adhered to the Church of Ireland or to Presbyterianism. On the death of Archbishop Trench of Tuam in 1839, the Province of Tuam was united to the Armagh. Over the centuries, numerous dioceses were merged, in view of declining membership. The historic sees of Derry and Raphoe were united in 1834. It is for this reason that the united diocese has two cathedrals.

Chas Messenger

Charles William "Chas" Messenger (JanuaryâMarch 1914 â 26 July 2008) was a British cyclist, a former Milk Race organiser and British road team manager.
Messenger was born in London. He began cycling in the King's Cross area, and despite being a "mediocre" rider in his own words, he beat the hour for a 25-mile time trial at a time when this was rarely achieved.
Tour of Britain.
Messenger was an official of the British League of Racing Cyclists, which started during the Second World War to promote massed cycle racing on public roads. The BLRC organised several Tours of Britain under different names and sponsors and then in 1958 secured sponsorship from the Milk Marketing Board. Messenger was the BLRC's event organiser and he and other officials visited the board at a hotel in central London. He said:
Messenger ran the Tour of Britain, known as the Milk Race, from 1958 to 1965, when he was followed by Maurice Cumberworth.
Merger with the NCU.
Messenger and Peter Itter, chairman of the rival National Cycling Union, forged the links which merged the two organisations to form the British Cycling Federation in 1959. He negotiated with the police to hold races on open roads. He became vice-chairman of the BCF's racing committee, which picked teams, for seven years. He managed the British road team four times between 1962 and 1967, culminating in the world championships in which Graham Webb won the men's amateur road race and Beryl Burton the women's event. 
He was sacked in September 1967 without explanation from the British Cycling Federation.
Honours.
The Chas Messenger road race, established in 2001, was named in his honour. It is a Premier Calendar event. Messenger was at the 2008 race.
In 2009, he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame.
Writing.
Messenger wrote several books in a style described as "intensely personal" and his "grasp of history doesn't always follow a chronological pattern", "but he's always an entertaining and exciting writer who never allows himself to worry unduly about such obstacles as spelling, grammar, punctuation."
Private life and personality.
Messenger spent all his adult life in west London, where he worked in local government. He was a member of the Chequers Road Club and an official of the British Cycling Federation's west London division. He was a prolific organiser of cycle races. He was known for a brusque personality. An obituary by British Cycling said: "His propensity for direct action and getting things done rather than long-winded committee debate made him a controversial figure to some then amateur attitudes."

Menor's Ferry

Menor's Ferry was a river ferry that crossed the Snake River near the present-day Moose, Wyoming, USA. The site was homesteaded by Bill Menor in 1892-94, choosing a location where the river flowed in a single channel, rather than the braided stream that characterizes its course in most of Jackson Hole. During the 1890s it was the only homestead west of the river. Menor's homestead included a five-room cabin, a barn, a store, sheds and an icehouse on , irrigated by a ditch from Cottonwood Creek and at times supplemented by water raised from the Snake River by a waterwheel. Menor operated the ferry until 1918, selling to Maude Noble, who continued operations until 1927, when a bridge was built at Moose. 
Menor cabin and store.
The Menor house and store are unusual in their application of classical forms to rustic log construction, an effect heightened by the whitewashed walls of the buildings. Menor made his own whitewash using materials from a lime pit on his brother Holiday Menor's property on the other side of the river. The Menor cabin has three rooms, built individually over a period of time, with a bedroom on the west, a store on the east, and a kitchen and storage room connecting them. The Menor cabin was the point of departure for the first ascent of Grand Teton on August 11, 1898, and it hosted the celebratory party that evening.
The Menor brothers were originally from Ohio. Holiday joined Bill in Jackson Hole in 1905, but the brothers did not speak for two years. Bill moved to California after selling to Noble. Holiday, eleven years younger, joined him about 1927.
Noble Cabin.
The property also includes the log Maud Noble Cabin, built in 1916 to the northwest of the present site on Cottonwood Creek and relocated to the ferry site when Noble bought the Menor operation in 1918. Maud Noble was originally from Philadelphia; she arrived in Jackson Hole in 1915 on a visit to the Bar B C Dude Ranch and never left. The cabin is a one-story, three room structure that has been repeatedly renovated. The L-shaped building measures about by . Noble sold the property to the Snake River Land Company in 1929 after a bridge was built just downstream to replace the ferry. A tea room operated in the cabin about 1927 or 1928, and again in 1950-51. 
The cabin was the site of a meeting on July 23, 1923, where Yellowstone National Park superintendent and future National Park Service director Horace Albright met with local ranchers and businessmen, starting the process of creating Grand Teton National Park. Local attendees were Richard Winger, J.R. Jones, J.L. Enyon, and the Bar B C's Struthers Burt and Horace Carncross. Noble provided the discreet premises, but did not attend herself.
Restoration.
The property was bought by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1929 who restored the structures and the ferry and donated the property to the National Park Service in 1953. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The Park Service has restored the hand-operated ferry to operation from 2009. The ferry is a pontoon of two floats with a platform spanning between them, with sufficient room for a wagon and four-horse team. The ferry uses the force of the river to propel the pontoon along a cable stretched across the river. The Park Service has also restored Menor's well. The ferry district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 16, 1969.

Capitol Park Historic District

The Capitol Park Historic District is a historic district located in downtown Detroit, Michigan. It is roughly bounded by Grand River, Woodward and Michigan Avenues, and Washington Boulevard. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
Description.
Capitol Park itself is a triangular plot of land (now a public park) bounded by Shelby Street, Griswold Street, and State Street. The plot is an artifact of Augustus Woodward's 1805 plan for the city of Detroit. The Historic District includes the park and seventeen surrounding buildings for a block in each direction. Buildings within the district include the Farwell Building, the Griswold Building, the David Stott Building, and the Industrial Building.
History.
In 1823, the population of Detroit had increased to the point that the US Congress transferred governance of what was then the Territory of Michigan to the governor and legislative council. To house the new government, a courthouse was built in Capitol Park in 1823-28. When Michigan became a state in 1837, the building became the state capitol, and functioned so until 1847 when the governmental seat was moved to Lansing. The building was then used as a public high school until 1893, when it was destroyed by fire. The land was then converted to a park, and it has remained a public space up to the present. In 1955, Capitol Park was redesigned for use as a public transport center, with a comfort station and four bus loading shelters.
The buildings within the Historic District surrounding the park were built primarily during the first three decades of the 20th century for commercial and business purposes. Several famous architects, including Albert Kahn and Gordon W. Lloyd, contributed buildings in a range of styles, from Victorian to Beaux-Arts to Art Deco. The buildings demonstrate the transformation of Detroit from a prospering 19th century commercial center to a modern city.
In addition to the present buildings, Capitol Park has a historic connection to the Underground Railroad. In 1850, Seymour Finney purchased a plot of land near the park and erected a tavern with a large barn. Finney was strongly sympathetic to the abolitionist cause, and used his barn to hide escaping slaves before their final trek across the river into Canada. A State of Michigan historical marker has been erected in the park to commemorate Finney's Barn.
In 1905, the remains of Michigan's first governor Stevens T. Mason were transferred from New York City where he died 1843 and interred in Capitol Park in a ceremony attended by sitting governor Fred M. Warner and mayor George P. Codd among other officials. A statue of Mason by sculptor Albert Weinert was later erected over the grave. When plans were announced in 2009 to reconfigure the park, they included relocating the monument and grave. However, the burial vault was not where earlier plans indicated and crews searched for four days before it was located on June 29, 2010. It was believed the grave was moved from its 1905 location in 1955 to make room for a bus terminal. On the 199th anniversary of his birth, October 27, 2010, Mason was reburied for 4th time in a newly built vault in the pedestal the bronze statue. The current Dean of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, where funeral services were held for Mason in 1843, officiated at the ceremony.
Redevelopment.
The opening of the Rosa Parks Transit Center in downtown Detroit in July 2009 marked the end of Capitol Park's use as a transportation center. A $1.1 million renovation project started in September 2009 by the city's Downtown Development Authority will redevelop the public space in an effort to draw new businesses to the area.

1976 Buffalo Bills season

The 1976 Buffalo Bills season was the 17th season for the club and its seventh in the National Football League.
Buffalo's season was troubled from the start, as the team was in a contract dispute with star running back O.J. Simpson. Simpson had been demanding a trade, before finally agreeing to a three-year, $2.5 million contract.
The Bills started the season 2â2, before losing their final ten games of the season. Quarterback Joe Ferguson only started the first seven games before being sidelined for the season with a back injury. Backup quarterback Gary Marangi started Buffalo's final seven games, all losses.
Fullback Jim Braxton injured his knee in the Bills' season opener and was lost for the season. Simpson still led the NFL in rushing in 1976, even without Braxton's blocking.
Bills head coach Lou Saban resigned after the fifth game of the season, with the Bills struggling at 2â3. Offensive line coach Jim Ringo took over, but would not win a game for the rest of the year.
Offseason.
Before the 1976 season, Buffalo lost some key players, notably wide receivers Ahmad Rashad and J.D. Hill, and defensive linemen Earl Edwards, Walt Patulski and Pat Toomay.
NFL Draft.
"Note: 1976 was the final year in which the NFL draft was seventeen rounds; it would be reduced to twelve rounds in 1977."
The Bills' 1976 draft produced four long-time starters with their first four picks. First round pick Mario Clark played for seven seasons with the Bills. Offensive guard Ken Jones played for the Bills for eleven years. Offensive tackle Joe Devlin played every game of his 14-year career with the Bills, playing in all 191 regular-season games until his retirement after the 1989 season. Defensive end Ben Williams played for the Bills for 10 years; he was a Pro Bowler and second-team All-Pro for the 1982 season.

1976 Detroit Lions season

The 1976 Detroit Lions season was the 47th season in franchise history. After the first four games of the season, Rick Forzano resigned under pressure of owner William Clay Ford, and was replaced by one time BYU head coach and Lions assistant Tommy Hudspeth. In spite of a stellar season by quarterback Greg Landry, that year's NFL Comeback Player Of The Year, the team was still mired in mediocrity, fininsing 6â8.
Regular season.
During the Thanksgiving Day game on November 25, O.J. Simpson of the Buffalo Bills set a record with the most rushing yards in one Thanksgiving Day game, by rushing for 273 yards vs. the Lions.
In spite of their poor overall record the Lions offense set a statistical record for Passer Rating Differential (40.9, 14th best 196â2011). Such a high rating is usually reserved for playoff teams or Super Bowl winners;

<doc id="18842972" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18842972" title="Edinburgh Corporation Tramways">
Edinburgh Corporation Tramways

Edinburgh Corporation Tramways formerly served the City of Edinburgh, Scotland. The city used four-wheeled double-decked trams painted dark red (madder) and white â a livery still used by Lothian Buses.
Origins.
The first trams in Edinburgh were horse-drawn and operated by the Edinburgh Street Tramways Company. This replaced an earlier horse-drawn coach system. The inaugural service (Haymarket to Bernard Street) ran on 6 November 1871. The tracks were laid by Sir James Gowans with John Macrae as engineer. These lines complemented and partly replaced the pre-existing horse-drawn carriage from Edinburgh to Leith, the only essential difference being the addition of guide rails. In January 1888 the Edinburgh Northern Tramways started the first cable-hauled trams. This had its depot and drive-mechanism on Henderson Row, a building partially preserved in the Scottish Life Assurance offices there. Part of the winding gear is preserved on the pavement to the east side of the office. The cable system only operated in certain central areas. In 1894 the Edinburgh Street Tramway lines in Edinburgh (but not Leith or Portobello) were taken over by the Edinburgh and District Tramways Company. On 1 July 1919 Edinburgh Corporation took over the operation of the city's tramways.
Leith Corporation took over the still horse-drawn Leith tramlines in 1904 and introduced electric traction in 1905 (the first electric system in Scotland). Edinburgh Corporation took over the Leith system in 1920 (see below).
Electrification.
Until 1920 Leith was a separate burgh, with its own municipal tram system. The Leith system was electrified, whereas the Edinburgh system used cable haulage (as still used by the San Francisco cable car system and the Great Orme Tramway in Wales). The cable was housed in a shallow trough between the tram rails; breakages could reduce the entire system to a standstill. The main depot was moved to Shrubhill on Leith Walk. An underground chamber at the main turn into the garages here was permanently manned during operating hours to try to reduce cable-snagging.
Passengers going from Edinburgh to Leith had to change trams (from cable-drawn to electric) at Pilrig on Leith Walk at the boundary between Leith and Edinburgh. This confused exchange of passengers was known locally as "the Pilrig muddle", and lasted until the electrification of the Edinburgh system.
In 1922 Edinburgh Corporation decided to convert the entire system to electric traction. This took around three years to implement. The last cable tram operated in June 1923. A short section of original tram rail and cable track can still be seen in Waterloo Place.
Musselburgh also had its own electrified tram system from 1906. Passengers had to change to the cable-hauled Edinburgh trams at Joppa until 1923. The Musselburgh system was subsequently incorporated into the Edinburgh system, with the tramway to Port Seton closing east of Levenhall in 1928. Musselburgh continued to be served by Edinburgh trams until 1954.
Extensions.
The system continued to expand during the 1930s. New routes included Gorgie to Stenhouse (1930), Braids to Fairmilehead (1936) and North Gyle to Maybury (1937). Further extensions were curtailed due to the outbreak of World War II.
Closure.
Edinburgh Corporation introduced its first motor bus in 1914. In 1928, given the increasing importance of buses, the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways Department was renamed the Edinburgh Corporation Transport Department.
Following World War II, all municipal tramways in the United Kingdom (with the sole exception of the Blackpool tramway) were progressively closed and replaced by diesel buses.
Initially, Edinburgh Corporation took advantage of the closure of other systems to buy displaced, modern, secondhand trams â notably from Manchester. Nevertheless, a programme of replacement of trams by buses was introduced in the early 1950s. Edinburgh's last tram operated on 16 November 1956, terminating at the Shrubhill Depot on Leith Walk (archive film footage exists of the event). As a curious feature at Shrubhill an underground chamber exists where the cable did an abrupt turn into the garage. This chamber held a man, who had the unenviable job of sitting inside, ensuring that the cable did not snag.
One tramcar has been preserved â number 35, built in 1948 â which was put on display in a small museum at the Shrubhill Depot for a number of years. The museum eventually closed in the 1980s due to a leaking roof. Tram number 35 operated briefly at the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 and on the Blackpool tramway, before going into retirement at the National Tramway Museum in Derbyshire where it remains on display today.
The main reason for the move to buses was the inflexibility of the tram routes should problems occur (one accident could bring the whole system to a halt).
When buses replaced trams they followed the same routes previously taken by the trams and used the same route numbers. This led to some anomalies which still , such as the absence of buses on the Pleasanceâa major city arteryâwhich was too steep at its northern end for trams.
Tram Managers.
The first Edinburgh Corporation Tram Manager was R Stuart Pilcher who was appointed at the early age of 24 in 1919 having previously worked in Aberdeen.
He left his post in 1929 to become Tram Manager in Manchester, England. He subsequently became Chairman of the Traffic Commissioners in the West Midlands of England. In 1921 he was responsible for establishing a trade organisation which eventually became part of the Scottish Council of the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT).
Pilcher managed the electrification of Edinburgh's trams in 1922/3. At the luncheon held on 15 January 1929 to mark his departure from Edinburgh and in response to Lord Provost Sir Alexander Stevenson's remarks, he said that ""they deliberately planned the changeover so as not to affect public opinion. They were nervous of the effect of the hoardings and a half-finished job.""
He was followed by FA Fitzpayne MIEE, who remained in post until 1934 when Robert McLeod M Inst T took over. He in turn was succeeded by William Morrison Little in 1949.
New line.
A new tram line from Edinburgh Airport to York Place (in the city centre) is expected to open in 2014.

List of Oldenburg locomotives and railbuses

This list contains the locomotives and railbuses of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways ("GroÃherzoglich Oldenburgische Eisenbahn" or"GOE").
Locomotive classification and numbering.
The locomotives of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railway were given a name and railway number corresponding to their inventory number, that was allocated in the order in which they were delivered. On retirement, the spare numbers thrown up were not re-used.
The names chosen for locomotives were mainly those of German regions, rivers and towns in the Grand Duchy and the rest of Germany. Even the names of animals, planets ad figures from Nordic mythology were used. The names of the little tank engines were especially original, intending to describe the way they moved, such as "HIN, HER, FLINK, FLOTT" (literally: "Here, There, Fast" and "Agile"). By contrast, the names of historical people were not used, in order not to "give cause for unnecssary plays on words and connotations". On retirement the spare names were reused for newly delivered locomotives. The "GOE" held onto the practice of naming locomotives far longer than the other state railways("LÃ¤nderbahnen"); this continued until 1920.
The "GOE" never introduced formal locomotive classifications. Only in the run up to DRG renumbering were Prussian class designations used in order to simplify the naming and grouping of Oldenburg locomotives. Several locomotive classes that, at the time of the renumbering were already retired, are only referred to by locomotive classes in secondary sources.
Steam locomotives.
Universal locomotives for all types of traffic.
During the first three decades of its existence, the "GOE" managed with a locomotive type for all railway services that, in constantly upgraded forms, was re-ordered repeatedly. 
Narrow gauge locomotives.
The "GOE"'s narrow gauge locomotives were procured for working the metre gauge line on the island railway on Wangerooge.

The reason for this is that before the admission of the Texans in 2002, NFL scheduling formulas for games outside a teamâs division were much more influenced by table position during the previous season.

Federal Point Light

Federal Point Light was a lighthouse at Federal Point near Kure Beach in New Hanover County, North Carolina. It was an active light from about 1866 to around 1879. 
Federal Point is on the inland side on the southern end of Pleasure Island, which a barrier island. It is near Fort Fisher and North Carolina Aquarium at Fort Fisher and Kure Beach.
History.
One or more lighthouses were built at Federal Point prior to the Civil War. A light tower was destroyed by Confederate troops in early 1860s.
After a new inlet opened south of Federal Point, a new lighthouse was constructed in 1866. It was a cottage-style lighthouse on piers. The light was extinguished in 1879 or 1881. A rock seawall was built in 1881 to close the inlet. The lighthouse burned in 1881.

Legacy Way

The M5 Legacy Way (formerly Northern Link Tunnel) is the fourth of five components of Brisbane City Council's TransApex Project. The project involves two bored tunnels carrying two motorway grade lanes of traffic in each direction from the Western Freeway in Toowong to the Inner City Bypass at Kelvin Grove. The tunnels will be tolled for approximately 45Â years and will be approximately 4.6Â km long.
The Environmental Impact Statement was released for public comment in SeptemberÂ 2008 and approved in April 2010. Construction commenced in April 2011 with plans to open the tunnel to traffic in late 2014. It is expected to carry 34,200Â vehicles a day when it opens and reduce travel time between the Centenary Bridge and the Inner City Bypass by 70%.
The project will be funded through council borrowings, together with a state and federal government contribution.
Tender process.
Three consortia were shortlisted and invited to submit proposals in December 2009:
The tenders for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the tunnels for up to 20 years were submitted on 12 May 2010, however on 5 July the BCC announced that the Leightons Baulderstone Razel joint venture bid would not be considered.
On 20 September 2010, Lord Mayor Campbell Newman announced that the winner of the tender process was Transcity.
The project is being delivered by Transcity, a joint venture between Brisbane-based BMD Constructions, Italian tunnelling specialists Ghella, and Acciona Infrastructure, a Spanish civil engineering, construction and infrastructure conglomerate. Acciona Infrastructure is the lead partner of the Transcity Joint Venture who are responsible for the design, construction, operate and 10 year maintenance.
Name change.
In November 2010 the Brisbane City Council has revealed that the "Northern Link" will be named Legacy Way in honour of the men and women serving in the Australian Defence Force. One cent of every toll (equating to $5.5Â million over the lifetime of the road) will go to Legacy Australia, an Australian volunteer organisation caring for the families of deceased and incapacitated veterans, including the families of fallen Australian Defence Force personnel.
Tunnel design.
Features.
Legacy Way will comprise two long parallel tunnels that will pass underneath Toowong, Auchenflower, Milton, Paddington, Red Hill and Kelvin Grove. Some design features include 36 underground cross passages, spaced every 120Â m, a longitudinal ventilation system, fire protection and safety management systems and free-flow tolling.
Alteration.
Brisbane City Council Lord Mayor Graham Quirk was quoted as stating that the former Labor state government had failed to support during the design phase of the project a busway connection linking Legacy Way with the Northern Busway. Despite a change in state government, the minister responsible for the Department of Transport and Main Roads, Scott Emerson, could not justify a busway connection at a cost of AUD 30 million. Although the inclusion of a busway connection represented only 0.25% of the project's overall cost, the LNP state government were at the time focused on reducing the Queensland government debt.
Construction.
Delay.
The initial financial assessment of the impact of the Brisbane River catchment flood in January 2011 threatened to suspend the Legacy Way project. If the project was suspended for six months, as outlined in Section 11.9 of the Legacy Way project deed, Brisbane City Council would have been required to compensate the Transcity consortium AUD220 million. Brisbane City Council confirmed the flood would not delay the project.
Boring was expected to commence in June 2012 but was delayed due to changes in legislation relating to tunnelling. Transcity is contracted to close the project by end of February 2015. For every day the project is late, a penalty of AUD250,000 is incurred. Transcity were reportedly negotiating with Brisbane City Council a date extension to close the project by.
Tunnel boring.
Two Herrenknecht Double Shield tunnel boring machines (TBMs) bored from the Mt Coot-Tha roundabout, Toowong, toward the Inner City Bypass (ICB), Kelvin Grove. The TBMs were named Annabell and Joyce, as a tribute to Legacy Australia. Annabell is named after Annabell MacKinney, the daughter of the late Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney who was killed in action in the war in Afghanistan in 2010. Joyce is named after Joyce Tweddell, a nurse during World War II who showed immense courage after being held as a prisoner of war in Sumatra for 3 years before returning home and going on to become Queensland's chief radiographer at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.
Progress.
Joyce TBM concluded the boring of the eastbound tunnel on the 24th of April, 2013, taking 7 months to reach breakthrough. Annabell TBM concluded boring of the westbound tunnel at 10:47am on the 13th of June, 2013, taking 10 months to reach breakthrough. Both TBMs bored in the same direction.

Spoil.
Spoil created from the excavation earthworks is being deposited at the Mount Coot-tha Quarry. A 870Â m long conveyor tunnel transports excavated material from the western tunnel entrance to the quarry.
Source (p.119)
Ventilation shaft.
There will be two ventilation shafts. The western shaft will be located in the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, Mount Coot-tha with the station underground. The eastern shaft will be located near the ICB, Kelvin Grove, and will partially be built into an existing hill.

Robert Carey (gangster)

Robert "Bob" Carey (August 25, 1894 â July 30, 1932) was a Midwestern armed robber and contract killer responsible for many crimes during the Prohibition era. He is considered a suspect in the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929.
Born and raised in St. Louis, Carey joined the Egan's Rats gang in his early twenties. By 1917, he had made fast friends with Fred âKillerâ Burke, who would turn out to be one of his closest criminal associates. After U.S. Army service during World War I, Carey remained a low-level associate of the Egan Gang. At this time, Burke was away in prison and Bob Carey became associated with Cincinnati hoodlum, Raymond "Crane Neck" Nugent. Both men were suspected of robbing of a Cincinnati bank messenger in December 1921 and trying to fence the bonds through the Egan's Rats. 
Carey was an alcoholic who got quite sloppy and violent when he drank. Nevertheless, it was Carey who was suspected of convincing Fred Burke to don a fake police uniform to rob a St. Louis distillery of $80,000 worth of whiskey on April 25, 1923. With the imprisonment of the upper-echelon of the Egan gang in 1924, Burke's crew had relocated to Detroit, where they were arrested for the March 1924 robbery of the John Kay jewelry store. While Carey was suspected of taking part, only Isidore Londe was convicted, receiving a 10-20 year sentence. 
Carey was suspected of participating in most of the major actions of Fred Burke's crew in the 1920s. Bob was specifically charged by Detroit Police with murdering two freelance hoods, James Ellis and Leroy Snyder, on March 16, 1927 after he caught them cheating at poker. Along with Gus Winkler, Fred Goetz, Ray Nugent, and Charlie Fitzgerald, Carey took part in the American Express armored car robbery on April 16, 1928 in Toledo, Ohio. The gangsters made off with $200,000 and killed Toledo police officer George Zientara. While never publicly named as a suspect, the Chicago Police Department sought Carey for participating in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929. FBI informant Byron Bolton would later claim that Carey did indeed take part, along with Fred Burke, Gus Winkler, Fred Goetz, and others. With most of his closest associates locked up or dead by early 1932, Carey left Chicago for the East Coast. He and his girlfriend ended up in Baltimore, where they began blackmailing well-to-do businessmen and politicians. The marks would bed Rose Sanborn and Carey would discreetly take pictures. 
By summer, they had moved into a Manhattan apartment at 220 W. 104th Street. Carey, now using the alias of Sanborn, had begun a high-quality counterfeiting operation out of his place. Despite his newfound success, Carey was still isolated, wanted across the country, and drinking heavily. The NYPD concluded that around midnight on July 30, 1932, Carey went berserk and shot his girlfriend Rose to death, after which he turned the gun on himself. In addition to being wanted for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Carey was a suspect in the Lindbergh kidnapping. Before leaving Chicago in January 1932, he had hinted darkly to associates that he was planning a crime that "would set the world on its ears". The FBI also investigated Carey in connection with the crime until the arrest of Bruno Hauptmann.

Saint Aldate (died 577) was a bishop of Gloucester, venerated as a saint with the feast day of February 4. Aldate's life is not detailed historically, but he was probably a Briton killed by the Anglo-Saxons at Deorham. He is reported to have roused the countryside to resist pagan invasion forces. He is mentioned in the Sarum and other martyrologies; his feast occurs in a Gloucester calendar (14th-century addition); churches were dedicated to him at Gloucester and Oxford, as well as a famous Oxford street: St Aldate's, Oxford and a minor street in Gloucester. But nothing seems to be known of him: it was even suggested that his name was a corruption of 'old gate'.

The Genius of Charles Darwin

The Genius of Charles Darwin is a three-part television documentary, written and presented by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.
It was first shown in August 2008 on Channel 4. It won Best TV Documentary Series 2008 at the British Broadcast Awards in January 2009.
Part 1: Life, Darwin & Everything.
In the first episode Richard Dawkins explains the basic mechanisms of natural selection, and tells the story of how Charles Darwin developed his theory.
He teaches a year 11 science class about evolution, which many of the students are reluctant to accept. He then takes them to the Jurassic Coast in Dorset to search for fossils, hoping that the students can see some of the evidence for themselves.
Dawkins also visits the place of his birth, Nairobi, where he interviews a prostitute who seems to have a genetic immunity to HIV, and talks to microbiologist Larry Gelmon. He goes on to predict that genetic immunity is a trait that will become more prevalent in the community over time.
Part 2: The Fifth Ape.
In the second episode Richard Dawkins deals with some of the philosophical and social ramifications of the theory of evolution.
Dawkins starts out in Kenya, speaking with palaeontologist Richard Leakey. He then visits Christ is the Answer Ministries, Kenya's largest Pentecostal church, to interview Bishop Bonifes Adoyo. Adoyo has led the movement to press the National Museums of Kenya to sideline its collection of hominid bones pointing to man's evolution from ape to human. The collection includes the Turkana Boy discovered by Kamoya Kimeu, a member of a team led by Richard Leakey in 1984.
Dawkins discusses social Darwinism and eugenics, explaining how these are not versions of natural selection, and that "Darwin has been wrongly tainted".
He then meets with evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker to discuss how morals can be compatible with natural selection. He goes on to explaining sexual selection, with peafowls as an example. To find out whether sexual selection plays a role for altruism and kindness among humans, he visits women who are looking for sperm donors, as well as a sperm bank manager. Dawkins also explains kin selection and selfish genes.
Part 3: God Strikes Back.
In the third and final episode, Dawkins explains why Darwin's theory is one of history's most controversial ideas.
Dawkins uses this episode to discuss the opposition that evolution has experienced since it was first discovered. He starts by approaching various anti-evolutionists, ranging from John Mackay from Creation Research, Wendy Wright, President of Concerned Women for America, to English school teacher Nick Cowen. In order to address concerns they bring up, he shows the evidence for evolution, including fossil and DNA evidence. He also talks to the teachers of the science students who he taught during the first episode, asking them why they aren't adequately teaching the ideas of science properly, allowing instead their students to believe that truth is personal and that science is merely a point of view.
Dawkins also describes Darwin's personal loss of faith, based not only on the natural mechanisms he saw, but also on the cruelty in the world which seemed to deny a loving God, in particular the loss of his daughter Annie. While Dawkins does address the bleakness of the Darwinian view, he spends the last part of this episode describing how Darwin and he himself address it, ending by saying:

Joe Kuharich is hired as Head Coach after he leaves Notre Dames. He is still their only head coach with a lifetime losing record while coaching there, going 17 â 23 in 4 years. Owner Jerry Wolman give Kuharich an unheard of contract of $1 million over 15 years. He then trades future Hall of Famers Sonny Jurgensen to the Washington Redskins and Tommy McDonald to the Dallas Cowboys. 
Earl Gros and Pro Bowler and Hall of Fame member Jim Ringo are acquired reportedly when he tried to have an agent talk for him during Ringo's 1964 contract talks with Green Bay. The Eagles send Lee Roy Caffey and their 1965 1st round draft pick to the Packers.
NFL Draft.
The 1964 NFL Draft and the 1964 AFL Draft were 2 different draft held by the respected leagues. The NFL Draft was held on December 2, 1963, and the AFL Draft was held on November 30, 1963. 
Where the NFL teams could draft any eligible player coming out of college, the AFL had territorial picks in the early rounds. These were players that lived in a certain area or went to college there. This could be why the Eagles 2nd round pick (16th pick), was the AFL's 1st pick in the draft. Some players made arrangements with the AFL leaders that they would sign for a set if a certain team drafted them, this was relayed to the AFL teams. Some of these players signed contracts as soon as their last college game was over on the field or in the parking lot.
The NFL Draft was for 20 rounds with 14 teams picking. The Eagles had the second pick in those rounds. They ended up picking 18 players. 
The overall pick in the draft was Dave Parks, an End out of Texas Tech. The Eagle choose future Hall of Fame member Bob Brown an Offensive Tackle out of Nebraska. There were 10 Hall of Fame members taken in this draft, 4 of them in the first round. The Dallas Cowboys get 2 of them when they take a chance on Bob Hayes in the 7th round and Roger Staubach in the 10th round. Roger Staubach had to serve a 4-year military obligation in the US Navy before he could play NFL football because he attended the United States Naval Academy.

NFL Draft.
The 1965 NFL Draft and the 1965 AFL Draft both took place on Saturday, November 28, 1964. This was the day of the Army-Navy game that is normally the last game of the college season before the bowl games.
They were separate from each other and some players were drafted by both leagues. The AFL was going strong in wanting stars signed and would do what they could to please them if they signed with the AFL. Joe Namath would sign if he could play in New York, and he was given a salary of $427,000. As in earlier years some players had signed "AFL contracts" they signed with the league as soon as their last college game was over and when drafted by an AFL team the contract was transferred to them. To help fight this the NFL moved the draft up to near the end of the college season.
A new kind of job was created, "baby sitter". Their job was to hang with the draft prospect, and keep him away from the other leagues representative. The Eagles draft pick, Otis Taylor was held in a motel and had to "escape" from the NFL baby sitter. He later signed with the AFL for money and a "Red Thunderbird Convertible" that the AFL baby sitter was driving. Taylor noticed how a lot of people stared at the car when they drove by, and he wanted one.
The first player selected was Tucker Frederickson, back from Auburn, by the New York Giants. The draft was marked by the failure of the St. Louis Cardinals to sign Joe Namath, who signed with the American Football League's New York Jets, and went on to defeat the NFL's Colts for the World Championship after the 1968 season.

Honda CBR1000F

Launched in 1987 the Honda CBR1000F, also known as the "Hurricane", is a sport touring motorcycle manufactured by Honda from 1987 to 1999. It is powered by a liquid-cooled, DOHC, 998Â cc, 16-valve four-cylinder, it crossed the barrier and is capable of .
History.
Manufactured from 1987 to late 1999, the Hurricane went through only three major revisions. In 1989, the bike received a cosmetic makeover with a complete redesign of the front fairing, improvements to the bike's front suspension, larger tyres were added to help cope with the bike's heavy weight and to accommodate radial tyres, improvements were also added to the bike's cam chain tensioner in an attempt to remove the annoying cam chain rattle some riders had reported. The 1989 model also had its power slightly increased to around and the model gained weight.
In 1992, the bike's looks were overhauled with a more streamlined and modern looking bodywork added. The biggest change was the introduction of DCBS, Honda's Dual Combined Brake System. The DCBS system was introduced to assist rider braking where the front brake lever operates the front calipers but also proportionally applies the rear brake, while using the rear brake will engage one front caliper. Since then DCBS has evolved into a very popular addition to many Honda touring motorcycles. No major changes were made after 1992. A touring model was briefly launched that offered a larger screen and hard panniers.

The 1966 NFL Draft and the 1966 AFL Draft
The 1966 National Football League Draft was held on November 27, 1965. It was the last draft in which the NFL and the AFL drafted their players separate of one another. As a result, many players selected by teams from both leagues would choose to play for the more established NFL, or in a rarer case, the AFL. The expansion Atlanta Falcons were awarded the first pick in the draft as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds. The league also provided the Falcons with an expansion draft six weeks later.

Petit train de la Rhune

The Petit train de la Rhune is a metre gauge rack railway in France at the western end of the Pyrenees. It links the Col de Saint-Ignace, some to the east of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, to the summit of the La Rhune mountain. Although this summit lies on the border between France and Spain, the railway lies entirely within the French "dÃ©partement" of PyrÃ©nÃ©es-Atlantiques.
History.
The idea of building a railway to the summit of La Rhune was first proposed in 1908, and a law passed in 1912 entrusted the construction and operation to the "dÃ©partement". Work started on the construction of the line in 1912, but was suspended during World War I. The line opened on June 30, 1924. In a referendum in 1978, the population of the nearby village of Sare rejected a proposal to build a road to the summit of the Rhune, thus enabling the railway to survive.
The concession to build the line, and operate it until 1982, was granted by the "dÃ©partement" to the "SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme des Chemins de Fer Basques", which changed its name to the "Voies FerrÃ©es DÃ©partementales du Midi" in 1914. The original concession was extended until 1994 and, as a result of a merger, it was taken over by the "SociÃ©tÃ© HydroÃ©lectrique du Midi" in 1989. 
In 1994, the concession expired and operation of the line reverted to the "dÃ©partement". From 1995 until 2012 the line was operated under contract by CFTA, a subsidiary of Veolia Transport, a large international transport services business that also operates several other tourist railways in France. In 2012 "Ãtablissement public des stations dâaltitude (EPSA)" stepped in as operator.
Technical details.
The line has the following technical characteristics: 
Trains consist of a four-wheeled electric locomotive that pushes two coaches up the mountain, and leads them down. Each coach is carried by a four-wheeled bogie at its upper end, and a single two-wheeled axle at its lower end. With six ten-seat compartments in each coach, each train carries 120 passengers.
The line operates from mid-March until early-November, with trains every 35 minutes.
The line is one of four lines in the world still using three-phase electric power.

Relentless Software

Relentless Software is a British video game company formed in 2003 that is based in Brighton. The company is best known for developing 12 games in the BAFTA award winning and multi-million selling "Buzz!" franchise from 2005 to 2010. Relentless released its first self-published title, "Blue Toad Murder Files: The Mysteries of Little Riddle" on PC and PSN in 2009 and "Quiz Climber Rivals", for iPhone in 2011. Relentless has also developed "Air Band" and "Mutation Station", for the "Kinect Fun Labs" series. 
History.
Relentless Software was founded in 2003 by David Amor & Andrew Eades, who had previously worked together at the Brighton office of Computer Artworks.
Computer Artworks had been in the process of creating a DJ simulation game for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE), but the company went into receivership in October 2003 before the title could be completed. Amor and Eades persuaded SCEE that they could set up a company and complete the DJ project for them. Much to their shock, SCEE agreed and Relentless was set up just 36 hours after their meeting with SCEE.
The company name arose from Amor & Eades ambition to develop video games in a different way to the perceived norms of the industry. They wanted development to be a steady flow of work rather than the more normal cycle of a slow start leading to a project ending with long "crunch" periods. They typed "unstoppable" into an online thesaurus and of the synonyms returned they chose Relentless as the company name.
Whilst Relentless were completing work on the DJ simulator - that had by now been named "DJ: Decks & FX" - they also carried out the conversion of an SCEE published title, "", for the Japanese market. "DJ: Decks & FX" was released in September 2004 and was nominated in the audio category of the 2004 BAFTA awards. More conversion work for SCEE followed, with the conversion of "SingStar Popworld" for the Swedish and Norwegian markets.
"Buzz!" (2004 - 2010).
In 2004 SCEE were approached by a company called SleepyDog who had secured the rights to a large number of music tracks and wanted Sony to use them as the basis of a quiz game. SCEE approached Relentless and asked them to design a quiz game using the music that Sleepydog had the rights for. 
Relentless ditched the idea Sony had presented them with, a board game on a screen, and instead developed the game along the lines of the player being in a TV studio, actually taking part in a TV quiz show. "" was released in the run-up to Christmas 2005. Initially the game sold poorly, so poorly that Sony considered cancelling further titles in the series, but over Christmas sales dramatically picked up, so much so that "Buzz!: The Music Quiz" eventually sold over 1 million copies.
A sequel, "Buzz! The Big Quiz" quickly followed in March 2006 and its sales kept it in the PlayStation 2 UK top 20 for a whole year. In July 2006 Relentless and SCEE were joint winners of two Develop Industry awards. Winning "Best New Intellectual Property" for "Buzz!" and the Best Innovation category for the Buzz buzzers. Greater recognition arrived later in the year at the BAFTA Video Games awards, where "Buzz! The Big Quiz", won the BAFTA award for "Best Casual and Social Game".
Further Buzz! titles followed in 2007, along with an educational version of the series. Relentless had been trialling an educational version of Buzz! in schools and after a successful trial a full version - "" - was developed in association with the UK Government's Department for Education and Skills (DfES), with the game's 5,000 questions being based on the Key Stage 2 Curriculum that covers children between the ages of 7 and 11 years.
In total Relentless developed 13 titles in the "Buzz!" series which accumulated total sales of over 8 million.
Self-publishing (2009 - present).
In 2009 Relentless repositioned the company so that as well as developing for external publishers it would also publish its own titles as well. July 2009 saw Relentless announce their first self-published game, "Blue Toad Murder Files". The episodic game was released for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Store in December 2009. Along with the release of a PC version at a later date. The 1-4 player game leans towards TV murder mysteries with "witnesses, alibis motives" rather than being a logic puzzle like Cluedo. As of July 2012, the game had sold over half a million copies, with the free episodes taking the downloaded total to 827,000. 
Relentless returned to its quiz heritage with its next title, "Quiz Climber", an iPhone game that was released in July 2011 and renamed and updated in December 2011 as "Quiz Climber Rivals". It pits players against friends in a test of knowledge. Correctly answering as many consecutive questions as possible to climb the quiz tree, with questions growing in difficulty the further players progress.
The game was Relentless' first title following its restructuring to a digital release only, multi-platform developer.
In May 2011 Relentless announced a deal with PlayJam to create content for their TV based gaming network.
Relentless released two titles for Microsoft's "Kinect Fun Labs" series in 2011. "Air Band" (formally known as "Music in Motion") is an augmented reality gadget that allows users to play virtual musical instruments. The second title "Mutation Station" is set in a mad scientist's lab and uses morphing of the Kinect video feed to transform the players appearances.
In 2012 Relentless announced "Kinect Nat Geo TV" which combines National Geographic wildlife films with interactive entertainment using Kinect.
Company culture.
Relentless was notable amongst video game developers in that it never had a crunch period during the development of its games. The company used to operate on a 9 to 5 basis with no overtime or weekend working.

Sherman Maxwell

Sherman Leander Maxwell (December 18, 1907 â July 16, 2008) was an American sportscaster and chronicler of the Negro league baseball league. Many believe that Maxwell was the first African American sports broadcaster in history. He was known by the nickname of Jocko. Despite his many firsts, Maxwell was rarely paid for his by the radio stations he worked for during his career.
Early life.
Sherman Maxwell was born on December 18, 1907 in Newark, New Jersey, where he resided for most of his life. He received his nickname of "Jocko" when he was a teenager. Maxwell climbed a tree while watching baseball in an attempt to catch a flyball when someone yelled, "Hey, look at Jocko!" Jocko The Monkey was the name of a popular performer in 1920s era films and the name stuck. He graduated from Central High School in Newark, though he was such a fan of baseball that he intentionally failed high school final exams so he could remain at the school for one more year in order to play high school baseball.
He later served in the United States Army in Europe during World War II.
Sports broadcasting career.
Maxwell reportedly began his broadcasting career in 1929 at the age of 22 when he began doing a five-minute weekly sports report on WNJR, a radio station based in Newark. (There are some discrepancies as to which station Maxwell first began working at, but most sources point to WNJR). WNJR was known as the "voice of Newark" during the 1920s and was owned by Herman Lubinsky, the co-founder of Savoy Records. It is believed by many authors and historians of the radio era that Maxwell became the first African American sports reporter. 
Maxwell was broadcasting on stations throughout northern New Jersey by the 1930s. He was heard by listeners on WHOM in Jersey City. He also hosted a sports report called, "Runs, Hits and Errors" on WRNY, a station based in Coytesville, New Jersey, which had a studio in Manhattan at the Roosevelt Hotel. His reports gradually expanded to include interviews with Negro league baseball players.
Maxwell later became the public address sports announcer at Ruppert Stadium for the Negro leagues team the Newark Eagles. He initially announced for games only on Sundays. Maxwell continued broadcasting for both games and radio stations until 1967.
Maxwell also founded and mananged the Newark Starlings, a mixed race, semi-professional baseball team. He also became a contributing writer to Baseball Digest, where he wrote about subjects ranging from the integration of baseball to Jackie Robinson. In 1940, Maxwell authored a book of interviews with players entitled, "Thrills and Spills in Sports". He also submitted stories on the Newark Eagles to the Ledger in Newark, which is the predecessor of The Star-Ledger newspaper.
He was inducted into the Newark Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2001, Maxwell achieved his lifelong dream by visiting the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, when he was 93 years old, though he was not inducted into the Hall of Fame during his lifetime.
Death.
Sherman Maxwell died on July 16, 2008, of complications of pneumonia at Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pennsylvania. He was 100 years old. He was survived by his sister, Berenice Maxwell Cross, of West Caldwell, NJ, and his son, Bruce Maxwell, of West Chester, PA. His wife, Mamie, and daughter, Lisa, had died previously.
In an interview after Maxwell's death, Bob Kendrick, the director of marketing for the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Missouri said that Maxwell had been well known by Negro league players as someone who preserved records and scores that would have been lost without him.

<doc id="18843234" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18843234" title="Bulgarians in Romania">
Bulgarians in Romania

Bulgarians () are a recognized minority in Romania (, "Rumaniya"), numbering 8,025 according to the 2002 Romanian census, down from 9,851 in 1992. Despite their low census number today, Bulgarians from different confessional and regional backgrounds have had ethnic communities in various regions of Romania, and during the Middle Ages Bulgarian culture has exerted considerable influence on its northern neighbour . According to one estimate, Romanian citizens of Bulgarian origin number around 250,000.
Historically, Bulgarian communities in modern Romania have existed in Wallachia (, transliterated: "Vlashko"), Northern Dobruja (, translit. "Severna Dobrudzha") and Transylvania (, translit. "Sedmigradsko"). Currently, however, the Bulgarian community in present-day Romania that has retained most efficiently its numbers, social integrity and strong ethnic identity is that of the Banat Bulgarians, a Roman Catholic minority in the Banat who account for the bulk of the Bulgarian-identifying population of Romania. In Wallachia, they are only few Bulgarians who preserved their national identity, though the numbers of those who speak Bulgarian and affirm to have Bulgarian ancestors is still high.
The Torlak-speaking Roman Catholic Krashovani are also sometimes considered of Bulgarian origin, but to have lost their Bulgarian identity in favour of the Croatian. In Austria-Hungary, they were regarded as Bulgarians.
The population of undisputed Bulgarian origin aside, Bulgarian researchers also claim that the Hungarian minority of the SzÃ©kely in central Romania is of Magyarized Bulgar (Proto-Bulgarian) origin and the Åchei of Transylvania were Romanianized Bulgarians (a view also supported by Lyubomir Miletich and accepted by Romanian writers).
Names.
While the modern Romanian word for Bulgarians is ""bulgari"", throughout the history they have been known by other names.
The old Bulgarian populationâwhich existed in Romania by the time of the founding of the principality of Wallachia and the inclusion of Transylvania in the Hungarian Kingdomâwas referred as "Åchei". This word, currently obsolete, derives from the Latin word "sclavis", referring to all South Slavs. Currently, the word appears in many place names in Wallachia and Transylvania, among which, Åcheii BraÅovului, a neighborhood of BraÅov.
The Bulgarians who migrated during the 19th century were known as "sÃ¢rbi" (Serbians). This word may have been used by Romanians to refer to all South Slavs, but it has also been proposed that they used this ethnic identification to prevent the Ottomans from demanding the Wallachian authorities to return the refugees to their place of origin. Even today, the Bulgarians from Wallachia are called "sÃ¢rbi" (=Serbians) though they speak Bulgarian and define themselves as "bulgari" (=Bulgarians).
History.
Antiquity and medieval Bulgarian Empire.
In Antiquity, both Bulgaria and Romania were inhabited by Thracian tribes, contributing to the ethnogenesis of the Romanian people and possibly the Bulgarian people (along with Slavs and Bulgars), although this is a matter of dispute. During the Migration Period, both the Slavs and the Bulgars crossed what is today Romania to settle in the plains south of the Danube, establishing the First Bulgarian Empire in the 7th century. In the Middle Ages, the lands between the Danube and the Carpathians were scarcely settled, but they were often at least nominally under Bulgarian control in the 9th and 10th century, as well as during some periods of the Second Bulgarian Empire.
The Golden Age of Bulgarian culture under Simeon I exerted considerable influence on the empire's transdanubian possessions. Old Bulgarian was established as the language of liturgy and written communication along with the Cyrillic script created in Bulgaria, which was used for the Romanian language until the 1860s; the first written text in the Romanian language, NeacÅu's letter of 1512, illustrates this trend: it was written in Cyrillic, intermixed with Bulgarian sentences and phrases. To this day, a notable part of Romanian's core vocabulary is of South Slavic origin, although much of it was replaced by Romance loanwords in the 19th century.
Under the Ottomans.
As the Second Bulgarian Empire fell under full-scale Ottoman rule in the 14th-15th century whereas the lands north of the Danube were still contested between the Europeans and the Ottomans and then came under Ottoman suzerainty, but retained their internal autonomy, many Bulgarian fled the Ottoman occupation in various periods and settled in what is today Romania. These included both Bulgarian Orthodox and some Roman Catholics (either former Paulicians from the central Bulgarian north or from Chiprovtsi in the northwest). The migratory waves were particularly strong after the Austro-Turkish and Russo-Turkish Wars of the 17th-19th century. The Orthodox Bulgarians settled all around the Principality of Wallachia; however, many of them gradually lost their Bulgarian identity and became Romanianized. Catholics primarily migrated to the Austrian-ruled Banat and Transylvania, establishing still-extant communities in modern TimiÅ County and Arad County; some former Paulicians also settled around Bucharest, in Cioplea and PopeÅti-Leordeni. The Transylvanian city of BraÅov ("Kronstadt") grew into an international merchant centre attracting Bulgarian merchants ever since the 14th century (it was given trade rights in Bulgaria by Bulgarian tsar Ivan Sratsimir's "BraÅov Charter" of 1369-1380) and rivalled Constantinople and Thessaloniki in importance, particularly for the people from northern Bulgaria, with many Bulgarian merchants opening offices and shops in the city. As early as 1392, Bulgarian settlers arrived in the city, contributing to the construction of the city church, today known as the Black Church, and populating the once-Bulgarian city neighbourhood of Åcheii BraÅovului.
In the mid-19th century the cities of southern Romania such as Bucharest, Craiova, GalaÅ£i and BrÄila attracted many Bulgarian revolutionary and political Ã©migrÃ©s, such as Sophronius of Vratsa, Petar Beron, Hristo Botev, Lyuben Karavelov, Georgi Rakovski, Panayot Hitov, Evlogi and Hristo Georgievi. In his 1883 novelette "Nemili-Nedragi" ("Unloved and Unwanted"), Bulgarian national writer Ivan Vazov (1850â1921) describes the life of poor and nostalgic Bulgarian revolutionaries in Wallachia known as "hashove" (ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð²Ðµ). Romania also turned into a centre for the organized Bulgarian revolutionary movement seeking to overthrow Ottoman rule: the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee was founded in Bucharest in 1869. In the same year, the Bulgarian Literary Society (modern Bulgarian Academy of Sciences) was established in BrÄila. Some of the Bessarabian Bulgarians were also ruled by Moldavia/Romania between 1856 and 1878 (during this time, in Bolgrad the first Bulgarian gymnasium has been opened: the Bolhrad High School), and all of them were under Romanian rule between 1918 and 1940. Today, they live in Ukraine and Moldova.
According to one estimate, the Bulgarian-originating population of the Romanian Old Kingdom and Transylvania (not including Bessarabia) by the time of the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 may have numbered up to one million. According to official data from 1838, 11,652 Bulgarian families lived in Wallachia, meaning up to 100,000 people.
After the Liberation of Bulgaria.
Following the Liberation, members of all Bulgarian communities moved to the newly established Principality of Bulgaria, but a significant Bulgarian population remained in Romania. Although set to be ceded to Bulgarian as per the Treaty of San Stefano, the region of Northern Dobruja was awarded to Romania by the Congress of Berlin of 1878. The region had a compact Bulgarian population in the Babadag region, with Northern Dobruja Bulgarians numbering 35-45,000 in the late 19th century. Romania also ruled the Bulgarian-majority Southern Dobruja between 1913 and 1940, when it was ceded back to Bulgaria, with a population exchange between the Bulgarians of Northern Dobruja and the Romanian and Aromanian colonists in Southern Dobruja. Today, as an officially-recognized ethnic minority, Bulgarians have one seat reserved in the Romanian Chamber of Deputies. There exist several organizations of the Bulgarians in Romania.

John of Lencastre, 1st Duke of Aveiro

JoÃ£o de Lencastre, or John of Lencastre ( ?, 1501 â Coimbra, 1571), was the older son of Infante George, Duke of Coimbra and of his wife "Dona" Beatriz of Vilhena.
Through his father, John was a grandchild of King John II of Portugal and a 3rd cousin to King Manuel I of Portugal.
Through his mother, daughter of Ãlvaro of Braganza (4th male son of Fernando I, 2nd Duke of Braganza), John of Lencastre was close related to the most prestigious aristocratic families of the Kingdom (namely the Duke of Braganza, the Marquis of Ferreira, the Marquis of Vila Real, the Count of Vimioso, the Count of Portalegre).
When he was 12 years old, he served crown prince John (who became later King John III of Portugal) and King Manuel I granted him the title of Marquis of Torres Novas by a royal decree issued on March 27, 1520.
In that time, the royal house announced the marriage of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Guarda (King Manuel I younger son) to the richest and prestigious heir "Dona" Guiomar Coutinho, 5th Countess of Marialva and the 3rd Countess of LoulÃ©. However, John of Lencastre declared he had secretly married the richest bride. The scandal in the Court ended when King John III ordered the Marquis imprisonment in the Castle of SÃ£o Jorge, in Lisbon, allowing the celebration of the Infante Ferdinand's marriage.
After nine years, when he was released, he went to live in SetÃºbal, maybe ashamed for the situation, and he only returned to the Court in 1535, to escort Infante Luis, Duke of Beja, who was leading the Portuguese fleet in Charles Vâs crusade against Tunis. In that year King John III granted him the title of Duke of Aveiro.
After his return from Madrid, in 1537 (where he was sent by King John III to present formal condolences to Charles V, when his wife, Empress Isabel of Portugal, died) John of Lencastre, 1st Duke of Aveiro, decided to marry to "Dona" Juliana de Lara, daughter of the 3rd Marquis of Vila Real.
In 1552, we was again chosen by the King to escort, from the border to Lisbon, the Infanta Joan of Spain, who would marry John, Crown Prince of Portugal (John III only surviving son).
John of Lencastre and Juliana de Lara had two sons:
John of Lencastre wrote several books and built a magnificent convent in ArrÃ¡bida, near SetÃºbal, where an annual music festival takes place.

Description.
Brewer Cove Haven Marina is located in Barrington, on Bullock Cove, at the head of Narragansett Bay. Barrington is southeast of Providence and from Block Island. The marina is far removed from the rest of the Rhode Island boating scene. The area was originally home to the Wampanoag Indians. 
First built in 1961, Cove Haven became part of the 21-marina chain owned by Jack Brewer of New York in 1967. Cove Haven is a full-service facility with a summer capacity for storing 220 boats in slips and an equal number on land. There is a full boatyard repair service for pleasure and commercial vessels.
The marina specializes in maintaining 12-meter America's Cup yachts. Among those yachts, America's Cup defender "Intrepid" was rebuilt there in 1997.
The marina specializes in fine hull refinishing. Other services include complete repair service to fiberglass hulls and inboard engines, metal fabrication, painting, sailboat rigging, canvas/sails, electronics, bottom cleaning, and keel installation.
Cove Haven is home to a yacht club, transient dockage, launch/haulout, new and used boat brokerages, marine store, fuel dock, and swimming pool. Boat-hauling equipment includes a hydraulic trailer, a crane, and a forklift. 22 employees work full-time year-round, with six part-timers added in the summer boating season. Boat sizes range from under 21 feet to well over 100 feet, with 66% in the 26- to 40-foot size range.
Management measures.
Brewer's Cove Haven Marina complies with the marina management measures for sewage facility and maintenance of sewage facilities, as well as shoreline stabilization, storm water runoff control, fueling station design, solid waste, liquid materials, petroleum control, and public education.
Environmental improvements.
With the town engineer's approval, a low-volume sewage flow meter and manhole were installed to measure 100% of the marina's sewage output.

<doc id="18843571" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18843571" title="Vladimir Romanov's ownership of Heart of Midlothian F.C.">
Vladimir Romanov's ownership of Heart of Midlothian F.C.

Vladimir Romanov, a Russian born Lithuanian businessman, initially acquired 19.6% stake at Hearts during the 2004â05 season. After Romanov made financial guarantees, his stake increased to 29.9%, which was welcomed by a fans representatives. Romanov eventually increased his majority share in Hearts to 82%.
Romanov no longer has any links to HMFC as both Ukio Bankas and UBIG have become insolvent. His shares are held by the liquidators of UBIG.
An arrest warrant has supposedly been issued in his name to answer a number irregularities in the accounts of both Ukio Bankas and UBIG.
Background and takeover.
Hearts, like many other Scottish Premier League clubs, ran into severe financial difficulties during the early part of the 2000s. An assessment by PWC in the autumn of 2003 found that Hearts, along with four other SPL clubs, were technically insolvent. Dundee and Livingston subsequently went into administration, while Hibs and Dunfermline both took drastic measures to balance their finances, cutting their player budgets severely and selling assets. Hearts also cut their player budget and, more significantly, proposed to sell Tynecastle to eradicate the club's debt. The fans protested against the latter course of action, forming a group called "Save Our Hearts". 
Hearts made a deal with the Scottish Rugby Union to use Murrayfield Stadium in order that they could sell Tynecastle. Originally this was meant to happen during the summer of 2004, but was then delayed for a season. During this period, Hearts were a public limited company. Ownership of the club was very fractured, with no individual shareholder owning more than 20% of the club. This meant that minority shareholders, including supporters' groups and the McGrail brothers, could realistically hope to acquire other minority stakes in order to block the proposals to sell Tynecastle. In August 2004, Hearts made a deal to sell Tynecastle to Cala Homes (a housing developer), but the deal had an escape clause which meant that Hearts could withdraw from the deal before 31 January 2005 if a viable alternative could be found.
Vladimir Romanov had shown interest in investing in Scottish football for some time because he wanted to see whether Lithuanian footballers could prosper abroad. Scottish football clubs were particularly ripe for takeover due to their weak finances and corporate structures. He made approaches to Dundee United, Dundee and Dunfermline, but these were all rejected. He opened negotiations with the board of directors to invest in Hearts during August 2004. Romanov offered the prospect of the club staying at a redeveloped Tynecastle, which was very attractive to Hearts supporters. Board chairman George Foulkes pleaded that the shareholders should not scare Romanov away by demanding too much for their shares.
Chief executive Chris Robinson, who had been the chief proponent of the necessity of selling Tynecastle, agreed at the end of September 2004 to sell his 19.6% stake to Romanov. Romanov called an extraordinary general meeting in January 2005 so that the club could pass a motion to exercise the escape clause in the deal with Cala Homes. The backing of Leslie Deans and the McGrail brothers meant that the motion was passed with over 70% support. The sale of Robinson's shares was completed on 2 February 2005 after Romanov made financial guarantees that the club could continue to trade without selling Tynecastle. This sale increased Romanov's stake to 29.9%, giving him effective control of the club. Romanov's takeover was welcomed by a fans representative.
Managers.
George Burley.
Chris Robinson resigned as Hearts chief executive after selling his shares to Romanov. To replace him, Romanov hired Phil Anderton, who had just resigned from a similar position with the Scottish Rugby Union. Anderton appointed George Burley as Hearts manager during the 2005 close season. During this period, Romanov started the practice of signing players through FBK Kaunas, including Edgaras Jankauskas and Roman BednÃ¡Å. The club signed other high-profile players such as Takis Fyssas and Rudi SkÃ¡cel.
With their new manager and signings, Hearts got off to a tremendous start in the 2005â06 season. The team won their first eight league matches, equaling a club record set in 1914. Romanov increased his shareholding in Hearts to 55.5% on 21 October 2005, and offered to buy the rest of the shares. Chairman George Foulkes sold his shares to Romanov and encouraged others to do likewise. Romanov eventually increased his majority share in Hearts to 82%.
In a move that shocked Scottish football, Romanov sacked George Burley on the following day. Hearts fans were led to expect a "top class manager" would replace Burley. Kevin Keegan, Bobby Robson, Claudio Ranieri and Ottmar Hitzfeld were all linked with the vacancy. Anderton, who had been making the approaches for these coaches, was sacked by Romanov on 31 October 2005. Foulkes, who had helped to bring Romanov to the club in the first place, resigned in protest at Anderton's dismissal. Romanov replaced both of them with his son, Roman Romanov.
Rix and Ivanauskas.
Romanov appointed Graham Rix as Hearts head coach on 8 November 2005 to replace George Burley. This appointment was not well received by the fans because Rix was a convicted sex offender who had not coached at a high level since a brief, unsuccessful spell at Portsmouth in 2002. Hearts' results deteriorated under Rix. It became apparent during February 2006 that Romanov was interfering in team selection. He agreed to meet a delegation of players to hear their grievances. 
As a result of these grievances, Andy Webster refused to extend his contract with the club, for which he was dropped from the team. Romanov suspected Webster of wanting to move to Rangers. In the summer of 2006, Webster exercised his right under new legislation to buy out the remainder of his contract. He signed for Premier League club Wigan Athletic, before being loaned and eventually sold to Rangers.
Rix was sacked by Romanov on 22 March 2006, who replaced him with former FBK Kaunas coach Valdas Ivanauskas. Despite the upheaval of two managerial changes, Hearts managed to finish second in the league, which meant that the club qualified for the qualifying rounds of the Champions League. It also marked the first time a club outside the Old Firm had finished in the top two positions since the 1994â95 season. Hearts also won the Scottish Cup by beating Gretna on penalties in the final. Following these achievements, Ivanauskas was appointed as head coach on a permanent basis in the summer of 2006.
Player unrest.
Following a 2â0 home defeat by Kilmarnock in October 2006, Valdas Ivanauskas went on a leave of absence due to unspecified health reasons, and was replaced by Eduard Malofeyev on a caretaker basis. Romanov declared that he would put all his players up for sale to "whatever club would take them" if they did not win their next game, against Dunfermline. 
Captain Steven Pressley, flanked by fellow Scotland internationals Craig Gordon and Paul Hartley, announced to the media that there was "significant unrest" as a result of this continued upheaval. The Hearts fans showed that they backed the players in their dispute during the game against Dunfermline, which ended in a 1â1 draw. Pressley was then dropped from the team and was then given a free transfer. He signed for Celtic, where he was soon joined by Hartley. Gordon was sold to Sunderland in August 2007.
2008 manager search.
After a disastrous run of results during the 2007â08 season, Hearts issued a statement on 1 January 2008 that said they would look to appoint a "British-style" manager in the near future. Romanov placed Stevie Frail in charge for the rest of the season, but Hearts disappointingly finished eighth in the league. Immediately after the end of the season, Hearts approached Motherwell for permission to speak to Mark McGhee with the intention of appointing him as their new manager. McGhee appeared to be on the verge of accepting Romanov's offer, but he eventually decided to stay at Motherwell. Hearts subsequently made approaches to JÃ¼rgen RÃ¶ber and VladimÃ­r Weiss, who both also turned down the job. George Foulkes commented that Romanov was "reaping what he had sown". Foulkes believes that Romanov has made the Hearts job unattractive to managers due to his record of interfering in team matters. Nonetheless, a head coach was eventually hired on 11 July when Hungarian coach Csaba LÃ¡szlÃ³ was appointed to the position.
Finances.
Romanov's management of Hearts' finances have become a source of concern. Before he completed his takeover of the club, Romanov had pledged to eradicate the club's debt. Soon after the takeover was completed, the debt was transferred from HBOS and SMG to the financial institutions controlled by Romanov, Åªkio bankas and UBIG. Romanov permitted Hearts to greatly increase their spending on players, which explains why the club have signed experienced internationals like Takis Fyssas, Edgaras Jankauskas and Laryea Kingston. 
Hearts' income has also grown during the last few years, but not by as much as their expenditure. The club was over Â£36M in debt at 31 July 2007, although Craig Gordon was sold for an initial fee of Â£7M days after that financial report was prepared. This, however, does not allow for the likelihood of further trading losses since the last accounting date.
Despite these losses and the consequent increase in debt, Romanov has pledged to construct a Â£51M new main stand at Tynecastle, which would increase its capacity to 23,000. Pedro Lopez, Hearts deputy chief executive, said that the proposals show Romanov's long term commitment to the club and that the increased capacity and revenue potential would allow them to reduce the debt in the long run. On 7 July 2008, Hearts issued a statement that stated the club would issue debt for equity in order to reduce the debt by Â£12M.
Despite this apparent investment, financial problems have continued to affect Hearts during the 2008â09 season. Player wages were paid late on two occasions, and win bonuses from the team's good run of form during November 2008 remain outstanding. This led to speculation that Hearts would sell some of their key players, including Laryea Kingston, Christophe Berra and Andrew Driver, when the transfer window opened on 1 January 2009, although only Berra actually left the club.
As of 17 June 2013, Hearts of Midlothian went into administration and owes the bankrupt company Ukio Bankas Â£15 Million Pounds.
Loan moves from FBK Kaunas.
Loan moves from Romanov's Lithuanian club FBK Kaunas to Hearts have proved controversial in Scottish football. The comparatively large number of such loans is seen by some as a bending of the loan transfer rules. Loan transfers from clubs outside Scotland are automatically exempt from the limitation on signing players on loan. Reaction to the influx of Lithuanian players amongst Hearts supporters has been mixed, with several being booed for perceived poor performance and the perception that they receive preferential treatment. In contrast, others such as Andrius VeliÄka (Hearts top scorer in 2006-07) and Marius Å½aliÅ«kas became established important first team players.
Controversial comments.
Romanov has been widely noted for causing controversies in football in Scotland. The first such controversy arose during the 2004-05 season when referee Hugh Dallas awarded a decisive penalty kick to Rangers in a Scottish Premier League match against Hearts. After the game, Hearts asked the SFA to investigate the "integrity of the decision".
Hearts were fined Â£10,000 by the SFA in October 2006 for bringing the game into disrepute. Romanov had said that "Last season, you didn't manage to protect the Scottish Cup and gave it to Hearts, despite all the referees' efforts and intrigues". 
During February 2007 it was reported that Romanov had accused the Old Firm clubs of "buying off" match officials and opposing players in the Scottish Premier League. The chairman of Celtic and the chief executive of Rangers both said they would seek legal advice if the comments were confirmed. Romanov then insisted that he had been misquoted.

Thomas Mumford

Thomas Mumford (1625â1692) is the progenitor of the Mumford family that left England and settled in Rhode Island. He was one of the earliest settlers in Rhode Island. 
Mumford and several other men participated in "the Pettaquamscutt purchase" which secured a large tract of land along Narragansett Bay for the English colonists. This area now includes the towns of North and South Kingstown, RI.
In 1664 Mumford was appointed High Sheriff of the region, in 1665 the Inspector General. During King Philip's War the Great Swamp Fight occurred on Mumford's land. The battle dealt a severe blow to the Narragansett Indian tribe from which they never fully recovered. From 1683 to 1686 he served as the High Constable of the colony.
In 1655 Mumford married Sarah Sherman, daughter of Philip Sherman, a prominent leader in early Rhode Island. The daughter of Philip Sherman and Sarah Odding, Sarah Sherman was born on 26 April 1636 in Roxbury, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. 
Mumford died in 1692 in South Kingstown, RI.
Mumford was also jailed in Boston for speaking out on behalf of the king.

William Gregory (1625â1696)

Sir William Gregory (1 March 1625 â 28 May 1696) was a British judge and politician. He was educated at All Souls College, Oxford and was then called to the Bar. In 1653 he married Katharine, only daughter and heiress of James Smith of Tillington, by whom he had an only son, James, who died in 1691 before his father. It was not until 1677 that William gained prominence, being elected a Serjeant-at-law. In March 1677 the election of Sir Thomas Williams as a Member of Parliament for Weobly was called into question and declared void, so William Gregory offered himself as a candidate and was elected without opposition on 9 March. 
After only a year in Parliament he was elected to serve as Speaker of the House of Commons in the Habeas Corpus Parliament, as a compromise between Parliament, who wished to reelect Sir Edward Seymour and the King, who was averse to him. During his time in Parliament Gregory was instrumental in the passing of the Habeas Corpus Act 1679, and was subsequently knighted and then confirmed as Baron of the Exchequer. In 1689 he was appointed Chief Justice of the King's Bench, a position he held until his death.
In 1677 Gregory purchased the manor and estate of How Caple, Herefordshire, from Edward Caple, whose family had held it since 1289, and subsequently added to it with the purchase of lands in Woolhope and Fawnhope, including the manors of Fawnhope and Sellershope, spending most of his free time at the manor house at How Caple. He was afflicted with kidney stones, an illness he bore well: a 1694 letter to Sir Edward Harley says: 
My distemper hath been very sharp apon me this winter, and I have not been out of this chamber these three months. My trust is that god, who has hithero of his goodness supported me under it, will sanctifie it onto me. 
He left adequate funds in his will to rebuild the parish church of St Andrew and St Mary at How Cable (1693â1695), with the exception of the chancel, which remains medieval. The building is apparently admired for its architectural beauty despite being built in a time where architectural design was at its lowest ebb.

According to "The Irish Times", Ashmawy managed managing his team while wearing 'nicely polished footwear'. When asked in an RTÃ Sport interview who he would like to see win the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Ashmawy joked that he was 'not going for the patriotic 'Go Ireland' I'd have to say New Zealand...typical. How boring is that. Think I've made myself feel a little sick there saying that. I'm going back...'GO IRELAND!'
Despite his popularity, Ashmawy has opined 'Most TV critics hate us' and has also said '...maybe RTÃ will get sick of us as well.' Indeed, an article in the "Evening Herald" (subtitled '...Bellowing Baz just seems to have taken off for another planet') complained about Ashmawy's 'unnerving' personal style on "FÃ¡ilte Towers" and said that he 'seems to be addressing a completely different audience in a completely different programme on a completely different planet, somewhere inside the universe of his own head.'
A later article by the same publication said that professionalism was something Ashmawy 'has a distinct lack thereof.'
In addition to appearing on as television host, Ashmawy is an actor who has appeared in television dramas and other programmes. He has also appeared in a plays and short films. Although he says that comedy comes naturally to him, his dramaturgical background has led him to productions of classical theatre and the works of Shakespeare.
On 4 March 2011, Ashmawy's employer, RaidiÃ³ TeilifÃ­s Ãireann, suspended Mr. Ashmawy for a period of one month following a drink driving incident the previous weekend.
Personal life.
He has a daughter, Hannah, with Tanya Evans. One of his lungs collapsed on a transatlantic flight and he underwent double-lung surgery.

Shooting fish in a barrel

Shooting fish in a barrel is an idiom, describing an effortless or simple action, with guaranteed success.
The Mythbusters team tested and proved the accuracy of their interpretation of the idiom. If the fish does not die from the shot, it is quite likely to die from the shockwave.
Before the days of refrigeration, fish were packed and stored alive in large barrels. The barrels were packed to the rim full of fish. Any shot that entered the barrel would hit at least one of them. Thus nothing can be easier than shooting fish in a barrel.

Tangential developable

In the mathematical study of the differential geometry of surfaces, a tangential developable is a particular kind of developable surface obtained from a curve in Euclidean space as the surface swept out by the tangent lines to the curve. Such a surface is also the envelope of the tangent planes to the curve.
With the exceptions of the plane, a cylinder, and a cone, every developable surface in three-dimensional Euclidean space is the tangential developable of a certain curve, the edge of regression. This curve is obtained by first developing the surface into the plane, and then considering the image in the plane of the generators of the ruling on the surface. The envelope of this family of lines is a plane curve whose inverse image under the development is the edge of regression. Intuitively, it is a curve along which the surface needs to be folded during the process of developing into the plane.

Ana Maria BrÃ¢nzÄ

Ana Maria BrÃ¢nzÄ () is a Romanian Ã©pÃ©e fencer born November 26, 1984 in Bucharest. She won the silver medal in the individual Ã©pÃ©e event at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games and the gold medal in the 2013 European Fencing Championships. Twice World champion and four-times European champion with Romania, she came first in the overall women's Ã©pÃ©e World Cup in 2007â2008, 2008â2009, and 2012â2013. She is current number one in the FIE world rankings.
Biography.
Personal life.
BrÃ¢nzÄ was born in 1984 in the Rahova district of Bucharest, the second of two children. A very energetic child, she was pushed by her parents towards sport. She first tried tennis because the courts were not far from home, but she left after one year because the coach would insist she used her right hand, which felt uncomfortable to her. She began fencing at age 10 at the suggestion of her elder brother Marius, who played football for a school team of CSA Steaua BucureÈti and took her to his club's fencing hall in Ghencea.
BrÃ¢nzÄ became champion of Romania for her age group after only six months of training. She was noticed by national coach Dan Podeanu, who called her for a trial in ConstanÈa and selected her in the national team. She left her family when she was 13 years old and moved to Craiova to be educated at the Petrache-TriÈcu Sports High School. The high school later gave her name to one of its alleys. She was offered a scholarship from an American university, but she chose to stay in Romania after her "bacalaureat".
BrÃ¢nzÄ obtained in 2007 a master of sports science from the Faculty of sports and physical education of the University of Craiova. The same year she was awarded the title of master emeritus in sports ("Maestru Emerit al Sportului"). Being from a military familyâher grandfather, father and brother served in the armyâ, she enlisted in 2000 in the Romanian Armed Forces as a sergeant with the support of her club, which is run by the Ministry of National Defence of Romania. She is however under no military obligations and is seconded full-time to her sport. She was promoted to lieutenant after her studies, and (as of 2013) holds the grade of captain.
BrÃ¢nzÄ is engaged in promoting student sport. She also supports AITA, an association for autistic children in Bucharest. In September 2013 she launched the campaign "" (ârun on your birthdayâ) which encourages people to celebrate their birthday by engaging in physical activity and gathering funds for a charitable cause.
Career.
BrÃ¢nzÄ won her first national championship at age 15. She joined in 2001 the fencing section of CSA Steaua under coach Cornel Milan. The same year, she placed first at the Cadet World Championships in GdaÅsk. In 2002 she took the gold medal in the Junior World Championships in Antalya, and the same year ranked number 3 in the senior World Fencing Championships in Lisbon. She was praised for âa remarkable tactical mastery for a seventeen and a half year old girlâ. She would later call it her fondest victory, because she was very young at the time and was there alone, without a coach.
In her Olympic debut in Athens 2004 she managed to beat experienced fencer Adrienn Hormay of Hungary, but stumbled in the table of 16 against China's Zhang Li and finished 16th. She later explained she felt overwhelmed by the Olympic experience and like a child lost amongst big-name athletes. From there her progression was steady with several medals in the European and World Fencing Championships both in the individual and team events. In the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing she took the silver medal, losing in the final to Germany's Britta Heidemann. She was awarded the Romanian order for sports merit ("Ordinul âMeritul Sportivâ"), second class for her performance. She finished first in the overall women's Ã©pÃ©e World Cup for two consecutive seasons, 2007â2008 and 2008â2009. She was designated a member of the athletes commission of the International Fencing Federation by its executive committee for the period 2009â2013.
After the Olympics BrÃ¢nzÄ began to complain of a pain in her weapon hand, but the competition rhythm did not allow let her to attend to it. She was defeated early in the 2009 European Championships in Plovdiv, but secured a team gold medal. She arrived with a No.1 ranking to the World Championships in Antalya, but was plagued by wrist pains and suffered a shock elimination in the table of 32. She had to undergo treatment in France and to follow a strict recovery program. After a break of several months, she earned a gold medal in her first two competitions, the Florina and Nanjing 2010 World Cup events . As to 2012 she still suffers from left-wrist pains and must get medical attention after each competition. In the 2010 World Fencing Championships in Paris, BrÃ¢nzÄ was again eliminated early in the individual event, but won the first Romanian team gold in Ã©pÃ©e with Simona Alexandru, Loredana IordÄchioiu, and Anca MÄroiu. BrÃ¢nzÄ contributed more than half the hits scored by Romania in the final against Germany. Her last relay against Imke Duplitzer was described as âa real example of technique and tactical intelligenceâ in an otherwise âquite monotonousâ match.
In 2011 BrÃ¢nzÄ took the bronze medal in the individual event of the 2011 European Fencing Championships in Sheffield and the gold medal in the team event after defeating Russia 45-31. The victory ceremony was marred by an incident when "Trei culori", the former, communist-era national anthem of Romania, was played instead of the current "DeÈteaptÄ-te, romÃ¢ne!" As team captain, BrÃ¢nzÄ decided to walk off in protest. At the 2011 World Fencing Championships in Catania, BrÃ¢nzÄ was stopped in semifinals by Sun Yujie of China. In the team event, the â girlsââa nickname the Romanian team had given themselves after the "Powerpuff Girls" animeâ managed to retain their world gold medal, prevailing 27â26 against China after a dramatic final where BrÃ¢nzÄ was hit on the left hand and had to receive ice and bandages.
Number 1 in world rankings in April 2012, she went for gold in the London 2012 Summer Olympics, but she was beaten 14â13 in the round of 16 by Ukraine's Yana Shemyakina, who later took the gold medal. The top-seed Romanian team she led was defeated 45â38 by 10th-ranked South Korea in the quarter-finals and fell short of the podium too. BrÃ¢nzÄ was quoted saying: "This is the most painful moment in my life. We wanted to win so much and that might have blocked our performance. I apologise to everyone." After the Games three Romanian team members retired from sport, but BrÃ¢nzÄ decided to continue her career and announced her new goal was the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. After the resignation of her lifelong coach Dan Podeanu, she began training under Octavian Zidaru.
In 2013 BrÃ¢nzÄ made the podium in six out of eight entries in World Cup events, including gold medals in the Challenge International de Saint-Maur and the Havana Grand Prix. She led CSA Steaua to a silver medal in the European Champion Clubs' Cup in Naples. In May she won her 8th national title as well as the team event. Number one in the FIE world rankings, she went to the 2013 European Fencing Championships as favourite. She came in only 21st from the pool stage and had a tight 15â14 win in the table of 32 against 17-year old Alona Komarov of Israel. Her later bouts were easier victories and she eventually earned the gold after defeating Italia's Francesca Quondamcarlo 15â11 in the final. She led a largely renewed Romanian side in the team event, scoring the decisive hit in the 44â43 quarter-final against Sweden; Romania then disposed of Hungary, but failed against Estonia in the final. During the 2013 World Fencing Championships in Budapest, BrÃ¢nzÄ made her way comfortably to the table of eight, but she was defeated in a tight 14â15 bout by Estonia's Julia Beljajeva, who eventually won the competition. In the team event, Romania defeated successively Denmark, Venezuela, and South Korea, reaping revenge on the defeat in the Olympic Games. They were stopped in the semifinals by Russia, which largely prevailed with a 44â33 victory. Romania then fought France in the match for the third place; BrÃ¢nzÄ entered the last leg on a 25â25 draw and beat JosÃ©phine Jacques-AndrÃ©-Coquin 8â3 to secure the bronze medal. BrÃ¢nzÄ was also elected a member of the athletes' commission in the elections held during the world championships.
In the 2013â14 season, BrÃ¢nzÄ took part in the World Combat Games in Saint-Petersburg, but failed to earn a medal after defeats against Emese SzÃ¡sz and Xu Anqi. She finished fifth in the first World Cup event of the season in Doha after Julia RÃ©vÃ©sz defeated her 7â8 in quarter-finals, but won the gold medal in the team event, scoring the decisive hit in additional time in the last three matches. She went on to win the Budapest Grand Prix, prevailing 15â7 against Irina Embrich in the final.

Dryandra subg. Hemiclidia

"Dryandra" subg. "Hemiclidia" is an obsolete plant taxon that encompassed material that is now included in "Banksia". Published at genus rank as Hemiclidia by Robert Brown in 1830, it was set aside by George Bentham in 1870, but reinstated at subgenus rank by Alex George in 1996. In 2007, all "Dryandra" species were transferred into "Banksia" at series rank, and the infrageneric "Dryandra" taxa, including "D."Â subg. "Hemiclidia", were set aside.
According to Brown.
In 1810, Robert Brown published the genus "Dryandra" in his "On the Proteaceae of Jussieu". Thirteen species were published, including "Dryandra falcata" (now "Banksia falcata"), but no infrageneric arrangement was proffered. Twenty years later, Brown published a further eleven species and the first infrageneric arrangement in his "Supplementum primum prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae". By this time, Brown had observed the tendency in "D. falcata" for one of the two ovules in each follicle to abort, thereafter developing into a winglike appendage to the seed separator. On this basis, he transferred the species into a monotypic genus, which he named "Hemiclidia", from the Greek "hemi" ("half") and perhaps "kleidos" ("barrier", "means of closing").
"Hemiclidia" was retained in the 1856 arrangement of Carl Meissner, but discarded by George Bentham in his 1870 revision of the genus. Bentham correctly observed that the abortion of seeds occurs in other "Dryandra" species, and is a diagnostically unimportant character: 
According to George.
In 1996, Alex George published a thorough revision of "Dryandra" in preparation of his monograph on that genus for the "Flora of Australia" series. He segregated "D.Â falcata" and the newly published "D.Â glauca" (now "Banksia glaucifolia") into a subgenus based on their unusual follicles, which are small, hairy and pliable. Needing a name for the subgenus, George noted that "Hemiclidia" was available, and had an appropriate type species in "D.Â falcata". He therefore demoted "Hemiclidia" to subgenus rank as "Dryandra" subg. "Hemiclidia" (R.Br.) A.S.George. Its placement and circumscription in George's taxonomic arrangement of "Dryandra" may be summarised as follows:
This arrangement remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred "Dryandra" into "Banksia". They were not yet ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing "Dryandra", so as an interim measure they transferred "Dryandra" into "Banksia" at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, "D." subg. "Hemiclidia" has been set aside.

List of Palatine locomotives and railbuses

This list gives an overview of the locomotives and railbuses of the Palatinate Railway ("Pfalzbahn") and the Palatine network of the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("KÃ¶niglich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen").
The Palatinate ("Pfalz") is a region in south-western Germany that became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816, even though it was geographically separate. Its union with Bavaria was not dissolved until the reorganisation of German states after World War II during the occupation of Germany. The Palatinate Railway was a private railway concern formed on 1 January 1870. It was nationalised on 1 January 1909, with its 870 kilometres of track, and went into the Royal Bavarian State Railways.
Overview.
Palatine locomotives were numbered in sequence as well as given names. On being retired, the numbers freed up were reused for newly delivered locomotives. Pontoon locomotives("SchiffsbrÃ¼ckenlokomotiven"), as well as engines employed on secondary ("SekundÃ¤rbahn") and narrow gauge lines used their own numbering scheme with roman numerals.
The allocation of names was stopped in 1904, because the purchase of the railway by the Bavarian state was approaching. Only four locomotives delivered after that were given names: three P 4s and an L 1. The names chosen were based mainly on towns, castles, rivers and mountains in the Palatinate. The use of names from myths from classical antiquity remained "Episode". The special importance of express train locomotives was stressed by naming them after Bavarian monarchs, as well as important people in the Bavarian government and managers of the Palatinate Railway.
The introduction of a classification scheme was first achieved in the Palatinate Railway in 1898. Four main groups were created:
An Arabic numeral followed the class letter to distinguish between the individual locomotive classes. A superscripted roman numeral indicated a sub-class. The Palatine class designations were only used on paper and not written on the locomotives themselves.
On the transfer of the Palatine railway network to the Bavarian state railways in 1909 the Bavarian classification system was adopted for new locomotives. Older locomotives however kept their original designations. New locomotives built for the Palatine network continued to receive the range of numbers associated with the Palatinate Railway.
Steam Locomotives.
Early Locomotives for All Types of Train.
None of the locomotives was given an operating number by the Deutsche Reichsbahn.
Narrow Gauge Locomotives.
The Palatine narrow gauge locomotives procured for the following metre gauge branch lines ("Lokalbahnen"):
Railbuses.
Palatine railbuses were introduced into the wagon fleet and were given wagon numbers. In addition to the new vehicles listed in the table below, two accumulator cars left by an electric company in 1896/97 were tested. Furthermore between 1897 and 1900 four four-wheeled passenger coaches â one with an additional centre axle - were converted provisionally to accumulator cars and placed in service. After the delivery of new wagons the passenger coaches were restored to their original state.

DAP Products Inc. is an operating company of RPM International Inc. RPM International Inc., a holding company, manufactures coatings, sealants, and specialty chemicals.
History.
DAP traces its roots back to 1865, when Robert H. Dicks and Elmer Wiggim began producing sealing wax for food canning out of Dicksâs garage in Dayton, Ohio. In those days before refrigeration and commercially prepared foods, canning was a general practice. In 1906, Dicks bought out Wiggim and joined with George Pontius, incorporating their partnership in 1913 as the Dicks-Pontius Company. When Robert Dicks died, his son John entered the business and expanded it to include putty and caulk manufacturing in bulk form.
In the 1940s and 1950s the Dicks-Pontius Company began selling caulks and sealants in disposable cartridges. Through the 1950s, the company grew through several acquisitions, including a merger with the Chicago-based Armstrong Company in 1957. The resulting entity was renamed Dicks-Armstrong-Pontius, which was eventually shortened to the brand name DAP.
In 1964, DAP developed the first latex caulking compounds followed with acrylic latex technology in 1970.
DAP began offering silicone sealants in the mid-1980s. In the 1990s, the Plastic Wood brand became DAP products. DAP acquired Phenoseal in 2004 and Custom Building Products ready-mix repair products in 2006. 
DAP has five manufacturing or distribution facilities in the United States of America, Mexico and Canada that service North America and the world.

Letters, Riddles and Writs

Letters, Riddles and Writs is a one act opera for television by Michael Nyman. The story is devised by Nyman, with a libretto by Jeremy Newson and Pat Gavin that incorporates Emily Anderson's English translations of correspondence and other texts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the subject of the opera. 
The opera premiered on the BBC television miniseries, "Not Mozart", directed by Newson and Gavin. Ute Lemper played the role of Mozart. Nyman appears as a court pianist instructed to play an "offending extract" of the "String Quart in E flat major, K. 428" when Joseph Haydn (Julian Glover) accuses Mozart of musical plagiarism in court, and Mozart complains that Nyman has slowed down his chords. This section of the opera is an opera buffa-style interlude. The majority of the opera is more serious. Extracts of the opera are featured on "The Michael Nyman Songbook" and "Mozart 252".
The film also features David Thomas (bass-baritone) as Leopold Mozart and Tony Rohr as Ludwig van Beethoven.

Èchei

Åchei (, "shkei") was an old Romanian exonym referring to the Bulgarians, especially in Transylvania and northern Wallachia. As a name, it has been preserved in the names of towns once colonized by Bulgarians, in toponyms ("Dealu Schiaului" near RÄÈinari), hydronyms ("Schiau River", tributary to the ArgeÅ River), surnames ("Schiau", "Åchiau"). The word is thought to derive from Latin "sclavis", a popular designation for the South Slavs (Bulgarians and Serbs in particular) that was also used in Albanian (in the form "shqa" and various dialectal variants) until the 20th century.
