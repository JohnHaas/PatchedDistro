Denis Lynch

Denis Lynch (born 3 May 1976) is an Irish German show jumper.
He represented Ireland at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Early on 21 August it emerged that he had withdrawn from the equestrian individual final which was due to have been held later that day. It was later confirmed that Lynch was banned from entering the show jumping final due to his horse, Lantinus, being found to have been in contact with illegal substances. Latinus was found to have capsaicin in his system due to the use of a cream similar to Deep-heat called Equiblock. Lynch had been using the banned substance for some time but maintained that he did not know it was illegal. He described himself as "shattered" due to missing out on his chance for an Olympic medal. Lantinus was one of four horses banned on doping offences; the others were from Brazil, Germany and Norway. Lantinus and Lynch had been described prior to the scandal as "Ireland's best chance of an Olympic medal in Beijing".
Rolex World ranking.
Lynch took over the position of highest ranked Irish rider in the October 2009 (ranking no. 106) World Rankings where he held 17th position. The following month, Jessica Kurten regained this title. He again took this title in January 2010 (No. 109) when he was again ranked 17th in the World, but this also only lasted a month. In the August 2010 (no. 116) World Rankings, Lynch reached 6th position and re-became the highest ranked Irish rider. He held this title for 4 months until it was taken over by Billy Twomey in December 2010 (No. 120). In April 2011, Lynch reached his highest ever World Ranking of 4th.
As of the end of March 2012, he is ranked 16th in the Rolex World Rankings – Ireland's no. 1.

2008 scandal.
Build-up.
Denis Lynch had qualified for the final on Thursday 21 August by posting his worst result of the equestrian event the previous Monday. He recorded six penalty points in his third outing of the competition. Four of the points had been for jumping errors, whilst two came about due to him exceeding the 88 second time limit. Lynch had had only two points going into the Monday's event.
Aftermath.
In the hours that followed the revelations, Horse Sport Ireland made a statement on Lynch's Olympic shame, saying it was "informed by the world equestrian
governing body, the FEI, at 2.15pm Hong Kong time on Thursday (21 August), that Irish Olympic rider Denis Lynch's horse, Lantinus had tested positive for a banned substance and that as a result he would be suspended from taking part in tonight's show jumping final." A urine sample from the horse's bladder was subjected to a voluntary screening testing process made available by the FEI on the horse's arrival in Hong Kong, the results of which proved negative.
The head of the Irish Olympic team, Dermot Henihan, refused to speak to Lynch, calling it "a bitter pill to swallow". A row is currently escalating after the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland threatened to ban the equestrian team from participating in future Olympic Games. In an interview with the "Irish Independent" Pat Hickey accused the show-jumping industry of dragging Irish sport "through the mud" and said the embarrassment caused by Lynch could have "very serious repercussions for the entire equine industry in our country". Damien McDonald, the chief executive of Horse Sport Ireland, called it a "nightmare" and expressed his disappointment at Hickey for commenting publicly instead of first meeting with him in Ireland. He says he believes show-jumping could be removed from the Olympics altogether, with the International Olympic Committee scheduled to meet in Copenhagen in October to consider applications from five new sports to be included in future Olympic Games.
Political reaction.
Minister for Sport Martin Cullen, who had been expected to fly from Beijing to Hong Kong if Lynch and Lantinus had won a medal in the final, was said to be "staying silent" as the controversy unfolded. The sports spokesperson for Fine Gael, Ireland's opposition party, Olivia Mitchell called it an understatement to say it was disappointing because "we knew we (Ireland) were going to be in the spotlight". She said there was no other option other than for it to have been an act of cheating or "incredible stupidity" and called for "swift condemnation and appropriate sanctions" to be handed out to Lynch. Mitchell did not accept Lynch's excuse of ignorance saying that "it is well known that capsaicin is a banned substance". She said the scandal would lead to "dismay among the public".
Perspective.
Doubt has been cast on the future of equestrianism as part of the Olympics. The doping scandal follows previous incidents at past Olympics, most notably the Cian O'Connor incident at Athens in 2004. O'Connor won an individual showjumping gold medal with his horse Waterford Crystal but was later stripped of it because of drug offences. Also in Athens, a doping scandal cost team Germany a jumping gold after the horse ridden by Ludger Beerbaum was disqualified when it tested positive for drugs. World number one, Meredith Michaels-Beerbaum, was left off the German team for Athens after her horse tested positive, though she was later cleared.
2010.
Towards the end of April, Lynch was selected as part of Ireland's Nations Cup Team in Lummen, Belgium. He was selected as first to jump (with "Abberuail van het Dingeshof") followed by Alex Duffy ("Tampa"), Shane Breen ("Carmena Z"), and Billy Twomey ("Tinka's Serenade"). In the first round they all jumped clear apart from Alex Duffy, who had 22 faults. As Duffy had the discarded score, he did not jump in the second round. The remaining trio then produced 3 more clear rounds to tie for first place with Australia on zero penalties. The jump-off saw Chris Chugg of Australia go head-to-head with Billy Twomey. With Chugg having four faults and Twomey jumping his third clear round of the competition, Ireland won. Lynch also achieved good placings on his new ride – "Lacroix 9". He directed the 15-year-old gelding to 3rd place in the CSI2* Grand Prix, and 2nd in a CSI2* Table A class.

He had been competing at the Global Champions Tour of Italy on the Saturday and travelled 600 km to win the class (and €7,500) in Weisbaden on the Sunday. Lynch then made his long trip very worthwhile by also taking the winners purse of €23,000 in the Grand Prix, again with "Abberuail van het Dingeshof".

Poplar South by-election, 1942

The Poplar South by-election, 1942 was a by-election held on 12 August 1942 for the British House of Commons constituency of Poplar South, which covered the Isle of Dogs and Poplar in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar.
Vacancy.
The by-election was caused by the death of the constituency's Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) David Morgan Adams, who had held the seat since the 1931 general election. The result at the last election was;
In accordance with the war-time electoral pact, neither the Conservative nor the Liberal parties fielded a candidate. The Labour candidate, William Henry Guy, was opposed by the Revd. P. Figgis, who stood as a "Christian Socialist".
Result.
With many men away at war, an electoral register which had not been updated for years, and the seat a safe Labour one, turnout was extremely low at 8.5%. This is the lowest turnout recorded in any UK Parliamentary election since at least the 1918 general election, which was the beginning of universal suffrage in the United Kingdom. Labour retained the seat easily.

Playing career.
A full back, Dean was a product of Chester's youth policy and broke into the first–team ranks near the end of 1981–82 as a 17 year old.

This spell also included an appearance at Wembley Stadium in the 1984 final of the FA Trophy against Bangor City, which Northwich won after a replay. After a spell with Caernarfon Town, Dean returned to Cheshire by joining Witton Albion.

City Place Mall, at the intersection of Fenton Street and Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland, is a , five-story shopping mall that opened on April 2, 1992. It was formerly a Hecht Company department store, the first suburban Washington, D.C., branch of that company, which opened in 1947; the downtown Silver Spring Hecht's closed when the Hecht's at Wheaton Plaza opened in 1987. From its start, the mall included "upscale" discount stores including original tenants Nordstrom Rack and Ross Dress for Less. The mall also included an AMC movie theater on its fifth floor, but it closed shortly after a 20-screen Consolidated Theatres (now Regal Theaters) opened directly across Ellsworth Drive from City Place. In 2005 Rihanna did a free concert at the mall, on a temporary stage that covered the fountain. The event was sponsored by D.C.'s hit music station Hot 99.5, and was in support of her debut album "Music of the Sun", with proceeds donated to victims of Hurricane Katrina.
The mall is at the center of a revitalizing downtown Silver Spring. Current City Place anchors include Marshalls and Burlington Coat Factory. There is also a row of street-level shops, including PNC Bank, Noodles & Company, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Ben & Jerry's, and a lower level food court now vacant with the exception of Brass Hen. The new slogan for City Place is "Life. Style. In the City." There is a proposal to build an office tower on top of the mall.

Jack Daugherty (baseball)

John Michael "Jack" Daugherty (born July 3, 1960 in Hialeah, Florida) was a major league first baseman and outfielder for parts of seven seasons with the Texas Rangers, Houston Astros, Cincinnati Reds and Montreal Expos.
Amateur background.
Daugherty played high school baseball at the same school that produced Detroit Tigers shortstop Alan Trammell (Kearny High School) in San Diego, California. At the collegiate level he played for the University of Arizona, and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Oakland Athletics on October 9, .
Minors & Independent League.
Daugherty was released by the A's in January after only one season in their farm system. He played the 1984 season for the independent Helena Gold Sox of the Pioneer Baseball League before signing with the Montreal Expos in December.
Montreal Expos.
Daugherty made his major league debut in as a first baseman with the Montreal Expos. He was 1 for 10 in 11 games with his only hit coming against Greg Maddux. After spending the entire season in the minors, batting .285 for the Indianapolis Indians, he was sent to the Texas Rangers to complete an earlier deal in which the Rangers sent Tom O'Malley to the Expos for a player to be named later.
Texas Rangers.
In he was used as a pinch hitter, back-up first baseman, left fielder and occasional designated hitter for the 4th place Rangers. He posted solid hitting numbers, with a .302 average, .364 on-base percentage, and .406 slugging percentage, over 58 games.
Daugherty's best season was , as he appeared in a career high 125 games, hit six home runs, drove in 47, and batted .300/.347/.435. He was the first Ranger to hit over .300 with 100 or more at-bats in back to back seasons since Al Oliver accomplished the feat in -.
The best game of Daugherty's career came on Sunday, July 8, 1990 when he was 4 for 5 with two home runs and three RBIs. In fact, Daugherty hit 20% of his career home runs in that game and did so in back to back at-bats against pitchers Roger Clemens and Jeff Reardon. The home run against Clemens occurred in the 7th inning and the blast off of Reardon came in the bottom of the 9th to tie the game. The Rangers would go on to defeat the first placed Red Sox in 11 innings.
Injuries limited Daugherty's season to only 58 games, for which he posted lackluster statistics of .194/.270/.264. Given a reprieve in , Daugherty nearly duplicated his '91 effort by hitting .205/.295/.276 over 59 games. The Rangers subsequently released him following the 1992 season.
Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds.
Daugherty signed with the Houston Astros as a free agent on January 5, . Assigned to the Astros' triple A affiliate the Tucson Toros, Daugherty responded by tearing up the Pacific Coast League by hitting .390/.488/.525 over 42 games. Despite these numbers, he found little playing time with the parent club, as perennial all-star Jeff Bagwell occupied first base and manager Art Howe seemed to prefer using Kevin Bass, Chris Donnels and Chris James as his primary pinch-hitters. Daugherty was 1 for 3 in just four games with Houston. His lone Astros hit came as a pinch-hitter against Bob Tewksbury of the St. Louis Cardinals in a 6-1 Astros loss at Busch Memorial Stadium on May 4, 1993. The Astros later traded Daugherty to the Cincinnati Reds on July 12, 1993 for Steve Carter. With Cincinnati, he played in 46 games while hitting .220/.338/.356.
Chiba Lotte Marines.
In January , Daugherty signed with the Colorado Rockies, but did not make the major league roster that Spring. After two seasons in the Toronto Blue Jays' and San Francisco Giants' farm systems, Daugherty played in for the Chiba Lotte Marines. He played in 19 games, batting .119, before being released in June. Daugherty is currently a hitting coach in the San Diego Padres' farm system.

Duchess Marie Gabrielle in Bavaria

Duchess Marie Gabrielle in Bavaria (; October 9, 1878 in Tegernsee, Bavaria – October 24, 1912 in Sorrento, Italy).
Biography.
Family.
Her parents were Duke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria, kinsman to the Kings of Bavaria and world renowned ophthalmologist, and his second wife, Princess Maria José of Bragança, a daughter of King Miguel I, exiled monarch of Portugal. Her paternal aunt was Empress Elisabeth of Austria ("Sissi") and one of her sisters was Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians, consort of Albert I.
Marriage.
On 10 July 1900 in Munich, Marie Gabrielle married her second cousin once-removed, Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria. He was the eldest son of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (later Prince Regent and King of Bavaria) and Maria Theresia of Austria-Este. The wedding was attended by Prince Joachim of Prussia, representing his father Emperor Wilhelm II. After their marriage, the couple settled down in Bamberg, Bavaria, where Rupprecht was head of an army corps. Their two eldest children were born there.
The couple traveled a great deal. For example, they journeyed to Japan and returned by way of the United States in 1903. The trip to Japan was scientific in nature, and the couple were accompanied by a renowned professor from the University of Munich. Marie Gabrielle wrote home quite enthusiastically about their journey. Like her parents, she was a great lover of science and nature, as well as poetry and music.
While in Japan, Marie Gabrielle became seriously ill. Upon their return to Bavaria, she underwent surgery for appendicitis. She made a full recovery.
Bavarian succession.
Rupprecht's grandfather, Luitpold, had become de facto ruler of Bavaria when King Ludwig II and his successor King Otto I both were declared insane in 1886. The constitution of Bavaria was amended on November 4, 1913 to include a clause specifying that if a regency by reason of incapacity lasted at least ten years, with no expectation that the King would ever be able to reign, the Regent could proclaim the end of the regency and assume the crown himself. The following day, King Otto I of Bavaria was deposed by Rupprecht's father, Prince Regent Ludwig, who then assumed the title King Ludwig III. The parliament assented on November 6, and Ludwig III took the constitutional oath on November 8. Rupprecht became the Crown Prince. 
However, Marie Gabrielle had died from renal failure the previous year and never became Crown Princess of Bavaria. Her husband later remarried, to her first cousin Princess Antoinette of Luxembourg, on August 26, 1918.
Marie Gabrielle was interred at Theatinerkirche in Munich near her deceased children. Her only child to survive to adulthood was her second son Albrecht.

Amanda Nicole Ventrice (born September 12, 1985), better known by her stage name Mandy Ventrice, is an American recording artist, songwriter, and vocal producer.
Born in the Bay Area, Mandy Ventrice began her music career at a very early age; writing her first song at the age of seven, and completing her first CD independently by the age of thirteen. Soon after, Ventrice joined a female pop group based out of Boston, called Poetry In Motion. In 2002, the pop group dispersed and Mandy launched new solo efforts, working with the likes of Shep Goodman & Kenny Gioia, Aaron Accetta, Carl Sturken & Evan Rogers, and Sam Hollander.
After moving to New York in 2004, Mandy began performing with rock trio, Lights Resolve; touring with The Used, Shiny Toy Guns, and Panic! At The Disco; and performing at major music festivals, including The Bamboozle and CMJ.

Grumman Kitten

__NOTOC__
The Grumman Kitten was a 1940s American cabin monoplane designed and built by Grumman. Two versions were built; the G-63 Kitten I with a retractable tailwheel landing gear, and G-72 Kitten II with a retractable nosewheel landing gear. 
Development.
As part of the post-war plan for the company, in 1943 Grumman started looking at entering the light aircraft market. The first design was the G-63 Kitten I which was an all-metal two/three-seat cabin monoplane with a retractable tailwheel landing gear and powered by a Lycoming O-290 piston engine. The aircraft first flew on 18 March 1944. Although testing continued, the aircraft did not enter production due to the continuing war effort. The original wing was replaced by a ducted mainplane to improve the lift/drag ration. On 4 February 1946, a version with a retractable nosewheel landing gear and dual controls, the G-72 Kitten II was flown. The Kitten II also has improvements to the wing and the single vertical tail was changed to a twin fins, although it reverted to a single fin before it was flown. 
In 1947, the G-72 was modified for ducted-wing testing as the G-81, it was fitted with slotted flaps to induce slow flight. It was first flown on 11 February 1947, but the project was abandoned.

All This Time (Sting song)

"All This Time" is a 1991 single by Sting. It was first released on Sting's 1991 album "The Soul Cages". The song was the first single from the album.
Being the album's most radio friendly track, the song was a chart success, especially on the American charts, where it reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Tracks charts. 
Lyrics.
The lyrics provide a reference to the death of Sting's father, symbolized by the image of a young boy, Billy, who, at the death of his father, wishes to bury him at sea instead of going through the Catholic rites:
Despite the dark lyrics, the uptempo tune of the song foils their macabre undertone:
The imaginary character, Billy, is also referred to in the lyrics to the song "Island Of Souls" from The Soul Cages album.
History.
The song usually opened the set on "The Soul Cages" tour. After this, the song was not played for several years till the Brand New Day tour, when it reclaimed its place in the set list. The song lent its name to the ...All This Time live album which was recorded on the 11th of September, 2001 at Sting's villa in Tuscany.
A video was also made, which depicted the wry, black humour of the song to a certain extent. It featured Melanie Griffith and Sting's wife Trudie Styler dressed as French maids.

Hoodoo Ann

Hoodoo Ann is a 1916 Lloyd Ingraham-directed American comedy-drama silent film, written by D.W. Griffith and released by Triangle Film Corporation.
Plot summary.
Ann (Mae Marsh) is a young girl who has been living in an orphanage since infancy. She is disliked and spurned by the other children, and treated coldly by the orphanage administrators—the reason for this, however, is unclear. She is told by the orphanage cook Black Cindy (Madame Sul-Te-Wan) during a palm-reading that she will be cursed until she is married. Ann's stay at the orphanage is an endless series of unhappy circumstances; she steals a doll belonging to a popular girl named Goldie (Mildred Harris), then accidentally breaks the doll, thereby adding to her loneliness and misery. One day, while the children are napping, a fire breaks out in the orphanage and Ann heroically saves Goldie from the flames. 
Impressed with Ann's selflessness, a kindly couple, Samuel and Elinor Knapp (Wilbur Higby and Loyola O'Connor) take her in and later adopt Ann. Ann immediately becomes smitten with a neighbor boy named Jimmie Vance (Robert Harron) and the two youths begin courting. Believing that her "curse" is coming to an end, Ann attends a motion picture with Jimmie. Enthralled by the action-filled western film she had witnessed, the following day Ann is inspired to imitate the film's main character Pansy Thorne while playing with a gun. Unbeknownst to Ann, the gun is loaded and a round goes off and the stray bullet enters a neighbor's house. Ann tentatively peers through the window and is shocked to see her neighbor, Bill Higgins (Charles Lee) lying on the floor. Believing she killed Mr. Higgins, Ann is despondent, sure that the curse is still upon her and fearful that Jimmie will never marry her now that she has committed murder.
After tearfully confessing to her "crime" and a subsequent investigation into the peculiar disappearance of the body of Mr. Higgins, the town is shocked when Mr. Higgins returns home several days later and reveals that he had simply left town to avoid his wife's incessant nagging. Overjoyed, Jimmie and Ann marry and the "hoodoo" is lifted. But the wedding ceremony is not entirely a happy affair; Ann appears distracted and pensive throughout, leaving the viewer to wonder if she perhaps believes that the curse is still upon her.

Jack Daugherty (musician)

Jack Daugherty (August 13, 1930 - February 2, 1991) was a musician and producer who is best known for being the music producer of the band The Carpenters.
Early work.
For most of his early professional career, Daugherty had worked as a trumpeter in Woody Herman's band. By the 1960s, he had all but retired from the music business, working in public relations at North American Aviation, an aircraft company with a location operating in the Los Angeles area. He went on to produce three albums: "Jack Daugherty and the Class of Nineteen Hundred and Seventy One" (referred to by "Sounds" as "a supersession of the finest studio musicians in Hollywood"), on A&M Records, "Carmel by the Sea", on the Monterey Label, and "Romance", on Columbia Records, Japan, as his last known project.
The Carpenters.
Though no longer actively involved in music, Daugherty still kept an open network with other performers throughout the years. One was John Pisano, guitarist of Herb Alpert's band The Tijuana Brass, and still a part of the A&M Records roster. Daugherty is credited with getting a demo tape of Karen and Richard Carpenter's work to Herb Alpert through Pisano.
Alpert seconded Daugherty's judgement and signed the Carpenters in 1969, whilst Daugherty also gained a personal production contract with A&M Records, in addition to being assigned responsibilities for production of the Carpenters.
He produced The Carpenters from 1969 with the release of "Offering" and continued until 1972, with the release of "A Song For You". These early recordings carry the credit "Produced by Jack Daugherty / Jack Daugherty Productions".
Daugherty was fired from A&M Records in 1972 after Richard Carpenter made his disagreement known to Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss that he would no longer tolerate sharing production credit with Daugherty. The disagreement was sparked by a Cashbox Magazine review of "A Song for You", which stated "Superb Jack Daugherty production", whereas Daugherty was not by definition a creative producer of any of the Carpenters' work, though he did production-related duties as far as booking musicians and studio time. Daugherty's departure sparked a bitter and lengthy legal battle between A&M Records and Daugherty, with Daugherty's claim of unfair dismissal ultimately rejected by the courts in 1981.
Daugherty's last project was his own music album, "ROMANCE", which was co-produced with one of his close friend Kojiro Ishii and released by Columbia Records in Japan. Despite the damaged relationship with the Carpenters, Daugherty did put his differences with the band aside and attended the funeral of Karen Carpenter in 1983. He died on February 2, 1991 of complications during coronary bypass surgery.

The Whitechapel and St. George's by-election, 1942 was a by-election held on 8 August 1942 for the British House of Commons constituency of Whitechapel and St. George's, which covered Whitechapel, Shadwell, Wapping, and St George in the East in the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney.
The by-election was caused by the death of the constituency's Labour Party Member of Parliament James Henry Hall, who had held the seat since the 1935 general election, having previously been the seat's MP between 1930 and 1931.
In accordance with the war-time electoral pact, neither the Conservative nor the Liberal parties fielded a candidate. Labour's candidate was Walter James Edwards, a stoker.
There being no other candidates, Edwards was returned unopposed.

George P. Buell

George Pearson Buell (October 4, 1833 – May 31, 1883) was an American civil engineer and soldier. He served as a Union Army general during the American Civil War, and remained in the United States Army following the conflict.
Early life and career.
George P. Buell was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, in 1833, a first cousin of future Union general Don Carlos Buell. He attended Norwich University in 1856, and later became City Engineer of Leavenworth, Kansas. He then mined for gold and later was a civil engineer in Colorado.
Civil War service.
Buell chose to defend the Union cause and entered the volunteer ranks of his birth state in 1861. On December 17 he was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the 58th Indiana Infantry. He was promoted to colonel on June 24, 1862. Buell led the 58th Indiana during the Battle of Perryville on October 8. Buell then led his regiment during the Battle of Stones River in late December into January 1863. During the fight he took over command of Brig. Gen. Milo S. Hascall's brigade when that officer was needed for division command, and Lt. Col. James T. Embree then led the 58th Indiana. After the battle Buell was given brigade command and led several different brigades in the Army of the Cumberland throughout 1863 and 1864. He also led a brigade during the Battle of Chickamauga on September 19–20, 1863.
On January 12, 1865, he was appointed a brevet brigadier general in the Union Army for his management of disassembled Federal pontoon trains used to construct pontoon bridges over waterways. Buell commanded various brigades (and for two brief periods a division) of the Army of Georgia for the remainder of the war. He led a brigade during the Battle of Bentonville on March 19–21, consisting of the 13th Michigan Infantry, the 21st Michigan Infantry, and the 69th Ohio Infantry. The brigade suffered 205 casualties during this fight. Buell was mustered out of the volunteer service on July 25.
Postbellum.
Buell elected to continue in the U.S. Army after the Civil War. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the regular army on July 28, 1866, in the 29th U.S. Infantry. Buell was appointed a brevet colonel on March 2, 1867, a reward for his performance in November 1863 at Missionary Ridge during the war, and a brevet brigadier general (both in the Regular Army) on that same date.
On March 15, 1869, Buell was transferred to the 11th U.S. Infantry, and was promoted to colonel on March 20, 1879, in command of the 15th U.S. Infantry. He died in 1883 while on duty in Nashville, Tennessee, and is buried there at Mount Olivet Cemetery.

You're Not the Only One Who Feels This Way

"You're Not the Only One Who Feels This Way" is Ammonia's second single from their second album "Eleventh Avenue". Released ahead of the album, this song was the second big song for the band and is generally regarded as their second biggest song after "Drugs". 
Originally written on the last day of recording after a phone call from the record company to Dave Johnstone. They advised him that there were no 'hits' on the album and could he please write one. After a near nervous breakdown, Dave wrote "You're Not the Only One Who Feels This Way" the next morning. Once the producer had arrived later in the afternoon the song was recorded. Johnstone proceeded to fax the record company that he had indeed "written their fucking single". Despite this the song remains one of their enduring legacies.
The song marks the second time Ammonia charted in Triple J's Hottest 100, coming in at No. 43 in 1997. The band's only other entry was "Drugs", which came in at No. 27 in 1995.

Luka Gregorc

Luka Gregorc (born February 14, 1984, in Ljubljana) is a tennis player from Slovenia. Gregorc reached his highest singles ranking of World Number "172" on August 3, 2009, and highest doubles ranking on September 12, 2005, reaching World Number "557". He lives in the United States, in the city of Boca Raton, Florida.
Career.
Juniors.
Gregorc's highest junior rankings were ninth in singles competition and fourteenth in doubles competition. He has had success at Grand Slam tournaments, reaching late stages in junior competitions there, including a semifinal run in doubles at the 2001 Wimbledon Championships with Jamaica's Ryan Russell.
1999–2007: Years leading to success.
Gregorc entered his first professional tournament in Portorož, Slovenia, a Futures tournament, which he lost to Uros Vico of Italy, 6–1, 6–3, in the first round. He won his first match in his second tournament, another Futures tournament, this time located in Jamaica, before losing in the next round. In 2002, Gregorc reached a final in Montego Bay, Jamaica, but lost in the final to Brandon Wagner of the United States. He started to produce better results later on in the year, but in 2003 he didn't show as formidable tennis.
Gregorc has played and plays for Slovenia's Davis Cup team, playing singles and doubles in 2004, 2006, and 2007, partnering with Mario Tkalec once and Grega Žemlja multiple times. He posted a 1–2 singles record in the 2007 Davis Cup, beating his Estonian opponent Jürgen Zopp before losing two singles rubbers to Morocco's Younes El Aynaoui and Rabie Chaki. He is 4–5 in overall performances, a record that includes both singles and doubles, at the Davis Cup.
The same happened in 2004 and 2005, however, Gregorc won his first match in his first main-level Association of Tennis Professionals ATP tournament, in Beijing, China, but lost. Finally, in 2006, he won his first tournament, winning a Futures tournament in Venezuela over Yohny Romero, playing in his native nation, in the final, before winning 1–6, 6–0, 6–3. So far, it is Gregorc's only singles title. However, he has also participated in Challenger tournaments, and has won matches in ATP tournaments in Asia, and one at the Delray Beach tournament. He has also won ATP matches since his loss in Beijing in 2005.
In doubles, Gregorc did win a Futures tournament with Roger Anderson in Montego Bay in 2002, and won another Futures title with Anderson before winning one with his current coach Marcos Ondruska.
2008 Pilot Pen.
At the 2008 Pilot Pen Tennis tournament, Gregorc made a monumental run to the semifinals by beating many higher-ranked players. First, the Slovenian defeated fellow qualifier Ramón Delgado of Paraguay, before beating fourteenth seed José Acasuso 6–4, 6–4 to advance to the third round. Then, he beat Ivo Karlović, the tournament's second seed, in the third round, 7–6(4), 4–6, 6–2, before continuing his unexpected run by beating highly-seeded Andreas Seppi, 4–6, 6–4, 7-5. His amazing feat was ended by Marin Čilić in the semi-finals.
2009.
After qualifying for the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, he became the first male Slovenian player in history to participate in a Grand Slam tournament.
2012.
Gregorc will be playing for the Philadelphia Freedoms of World Team Tennis this summer. It will be his first season playing for WTT. The Freedoms will compete in 14 matches this season, including seven home matches played at The Pavilion at Villanova University.

Project CHLOE

Project CHLOE is a research and development program of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to explore technology-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted defenses for airports and airliners against the threat of infrared man-portable anti-aircraft missiles. The project's name refers to the character Chloe O'Brian on the television show "24", which is Former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff's favorite show.
Concept.
The primary concept being explored by Project CHLOE is to have a UAV circling at above a major airport which is equipped for the dual role of detecting and defeating a heat-seeking missile launched against an airliner. Other systems, such as the Northrop Grumman Guardian, CAMPS and Flight Guard have been developed which would be mounted on individual commercial aircraft, but such systems can cost upwards of US$1 million per plane, and airlines would prefer a more workable and affordable solution over using equipment that they have to both pay for and then maintain. The program is the result of a congressional directive to the DHS to explore technology options parallel with the development of aircraft-mounted systems.
The proposed UAVs would have a long loiter time, up to 24 hours per flight, so that there would be a "perpetual orbit", of an aircraft above an airport. The system would have all-weather capabilities to scan a threat envelope of a radius around the airport, and air traffic up to an altitude of , plus standard approach and departure corridors up to from airports. The system would be required to respond to a threat within three to ten seconds. It would also have to be unaffected by ground clutter which could mimic the signature of a missile launch. "One of these devices flying above would cover all of the commercial airports in the L.A. County area," said Admiral Jay M. Cohen, DHS' technology chief.
Development.
Program objectives.
According to DHS literature, there are three objectives to Project CHLOE development. The first is to "investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of persistent stand-off Counter-MANPADS protection". This includes using one or more UAVs stationed over airports which are equipped with both warning systems and countermeasures systems, or using UAVs networked with ground-based countermeasures. The UAVs would be autonomous in their flight and detection operations.
The second objective is to "investigate and demonstrate DHS missions and payloads that are compatible with CHLOE technology platform and operating environment." These secondary roles for the UAVs would include emergency and disaster relief support, support of the Customs and Border Patrol and Coast Guard for border and maritime surveillance and interdiction, and critical infrastructure monitoring.
The third objective is integrate such technologies into the air traffic control system and other law enforcement agencies for overall situational awareness.
Hardware development.
The development program has a reported budget of US$12.7 million. The countermeasures systems are to be tested on drones operating over the Patuxent River Naval Air Station. DHS has proposed testing on one of several existing UAVs, the RQ-4 Global Hawk, the RQ-9 Reaper or the Altair (NASA's version of the Reaper). DHS also suggested the use of a manned surrogate aircraft, either the Scaled Composites Proteus, a Lockheed ER-2 or a modified Gulfstream G550.
Also included in the study is the means of implementing the system at a number of key U.S. airports, including Denver International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, San Diego International Airport, McCarran International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
Concerns.
Civilian pilot groups have expressed concern about impact of drone operations in civilian airspace, especially during takeoff and landing. During the actual loitering, the drones will not be a factor to civilian air traffic, since they will be above the national airspace.
DHS is also addressing concerns about the danger to people on the ground from lasers being directed downward, as well as concerns over a falling defeated missile.

The Berlin Affair

The Berlin Affair () is a 1985 Italo-German film, directed by Liliana Cavani and starring Gudrun Landgrebe, Kevin McNally and Mio Takaki. Set in Berlin, 1938, it sees the wife of a rising Nazi diplomat fall in love with Mitsuko Matsugae, the daughter of the Japanese Ambassador and an artist. Her husband finds out, and moves to break up the affair. However he soon falls in love with Mitsuko himself, leading to the intervention of officials higher in the system. The film is based upon the novel "Quicksand" by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki.
Plot.
Berlin 1938: Louise von Hollendorf is married to Heinz, a German senior diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She decides to take drawing lessons at the institute of Fine Arts. At the institute, Louise meets Mitsuko Matsugae, a young and alluring daughter of the Japanese Ambassador. Captivated by Mitsuko's beauty, Louise asks her to model for her sketching practice. Rumor spreads at the institute that the two woman are romantically engaged. Rather than driving them apart the rumors bring the two friends closer together and soon they have a passionate affair. As Louise later confides to her professor, "One moment we were laughing, the next, we were making love". They have their romantic encounters first at Louise's house and later at a seedy hotel. After spending more and more time together Louise falls in love with Mitsuko. 
Her husband, Heinz, grows suspicious of the women's relationship. Heinz becomes not only jealous but also worried that his wife's indiscretions might harm his political ambitions. Heinz confronts Louise, who denies his allegation even in the face of clear evidence.
One day, Louise discovers that Mitsuko has had an affair with Joseph Benno, their half-Italian drawing instructor. Louise learns about Mitsuko and Joseph's plan to marry and that the two have spread the lesbian rumors to distract from their own socially unacceptable, mixed-race relationship. Disgusted and disillusioned, Louise breaks away from Mitsuko and returns to her husband, confessing the full extent of what has happened.
Meanwhile, the Nazi regime starts to eliminate dissidents under the cloak of a morality campaign. Wolf von Hollendorf, Heinz’s cousin and a high-ranking Gestapo officer, forces Louise and Heinz to participate in a plot, which uncovers General Werner von Heiden's homosexuality. Louise and Heinz are forced to set a trap for von Heiden at their house by inviting the older General and his lover, a young handsome pianist. At the visit, Wolf exposes von Heiden's relationship, ruining the general's career. 
A month later, Mitsuko reappears in Louise’s life, faking being ill and pregnant. Louise does not believe Mitsuko, nevertheless they rekindle their affair with even greater intensity. Benno, who still has a relationship with Mitsuko, promises Louise that he will not interfere with Louise's and Mitsuko's relationship if Louise helps them in getting married. Louise reluctantly agrees. Benno then uses their written agreement to blackmail Heinz who, with Wolf's help, deports Benno. 
Heinz is now determined to separate his wife from her Japanese lover. The two women plan to scare Heinz to accept their relationship by faking an attempted suicide. The plan takes an unexpected turn when Mitsuko seduces Heinz in a ménage à trois. Caught in a love triangle Louise, Mitsuko and Heinz grow more and more jealous of each other. Mitsuko, jealous and possessive, dominates Louise and Heinz. At a dinner, Mitsuko drugs the von Hollendorfs with sleeping pills to prevent them from having sex. Mitsuko uses the ruse to turn Heinz and Louise on each other. By now, their self-destructive relationship becomes publicly known to the Nazi regime as the exiled Benno publishes his account abroad. To avoid the scandal, Heinz is asked to resign and leaves Berlin. Wolf temporarily withdraws their passports. However, rather than leave each other, all three drink poison in a ceremonial rite. 
Upon awakening, and to her bewilderment, Louise discovers that both Heinz and Mitsuko are dead, revealing that she was given a sedative instead of poison, and effectively being left behind and betrayed by both her lovers. She confides in her professor one last time. He urges her to publish her story before she is arrested by the Gestapo.
Production.
The original title of the film, "Interno Berlinese", can be translated as Inside Berlin or Interior Berliner. The story is based upon Jun'ichirō Tanizaki.’s novel "Quicksand", "Manji", better known as "The Buddist Cross" 1928 -1930. Cavani was drawn to the novel because of its dramatic " intensity and extreme economy, his capacity to bring us, as nearly breathless spectators, inside the meaning of seemingly insignificant details. "Manji" was published a serial novel in a literary magazine between 1928 and 1930. Sonoko the first person narrator, recounts her own story to a prominent writer as a long monologue that continues the novel itself. It is the story of a passionate love affair with Mitsuko that eventually involves her husband and Watanuki, an impotent effeminate dandy. Mitsuki was actually the name of Tanizaki third wife. She inspired several of his novels. Cavanai brought the story forward in time and set the plot in Germany in 1938.
"The Berlin Affair" was the first film produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus in Italy for Cannon. It was shot in Rome at the Paolis Studios and Vienna from April to July 1985. Gudrun Landgrabe, one of the discoveries of the New German Cinema, had appeared in Robert van Ackeren’s Die Flambierte frau "The woman in Flames" 1982, Edgar Reitz’s Heimat 1984, and István Szabó’s Colonel Redl 1985. Kevin McNally, a British actor, plays the husband. Casting the role of Mitzuko was challlenging. Cavani went to Tokyo looking for a model of beauty that could balance seductiveness with an iron will. She found it in the 24-year-old actress and pop singer Mio Takaki.
Release.
It was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival. "The Berlin Affair " is available in Region 2 DVD. It has not been released on DVD in the U.S.A.

Rocky Patel Premium Cigars

The Rocky Patel Premium Cigar Company is a manufacturer of cigars, founded by Rakesh "Rocky" Patel. The company is currently based in Naples, Florida.
History.
Born in India in 1961, Rakesh "Rocky" Patel introduced the Indian Tabac blend in the mid 1990s. Rakesh was originally a Hollywood attorney who represented several actors, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gene Hackman. Patel was exposed to cigar smoking by spending time with the actors between takes. This led to an interest in the industry. He subsequently sold his legal practice
and spent five years in Honduras working and learning the cigar trade, including field and barn work.

Simultaneous voice and data

In telecommunications, a system that supports simultaneous voice and data (SVD) is one that can transceive both voice and primary data concurrently over one PSTN modem.
Background.
Before telecommunication networks began to support data related services, the bearer channel was dedicated solely to voice information. When support for data related services was originally released, the bearer channel was switched between being dedicated to voice information or dedicated to primary data information, depending on the subscriber's needs at any given time. Eventually, support for simultaneous voice and data transmission was added to modems and mobile devices, to enable subscribers to use voice and data services at the same time.

Erik Gandini

Erik Gandini (born 14 August 1967) is an Italian-Swedish film director, writer, and producer. He is one of the co-founders of ATMO film company.
Early life.
Erik Gandini moved to Sweden at age 19 to attend film school and avoid military service in Italy. After film school studies at Biskops Arnö and a master's degree in film science at Stockholm University, he started working as a documentary filmmaker.
In 1994, Gandini adventured with a fake recommendation letter from a small local Swedish TV broadcaster to the besieged city of Sarajevo where he directed and produced his first documentary "Raja Sarajevo" for SVT, Swedish Television. The film, shot on a small Hi-8 camera by cinematographer Martina Iverus, followed four young friends trying to survive the brutality of the siege. "Raja Sarajevo" was his international breakthrough and was presented at Berlin International Film Festival, at IDFA, Cinema du Reél in Paris.
In 2000, Erik Gandini founded the Stockholm-based film production company ATMO, together with Tarik Saleh, Lars Rodvald and Kristina Åberg. ATMO produces documentaries, fiction films and TV series.
Documentaries.
Raja Sarajevo.
Raja Sarajevo from 1994 (Raja means 'group of friends' in Bosnian) starred i.a. Enes Zlatar, leader of rock band Sikter and international artist Nebojsa Seric Soba, who at the time was a part-time art student and part-time soldier in the Bosnian army.
In 1996, Erik Gandini shot a second documentary about the Balkan war, "Not without Priedor", about four young Bosnian refugees in Sweden who decided to return to their country to join the war. The same year he became part of a cult TV show on Swedish TV, "ELBYL", where he met with Tarik Saleh.
His film "Amerasians-the 100.000 children of the vietnam war" from 1998 about the children of American soldiers and Vietnamese women was awarded the Silver Spire at the 1999 San Francisco International Film Festival

In 2001, he co-directed with Tarik Saleh the documentary film "Sacrificio-who betrayed Che Guevara". The film centers around :es:Ciro Bustos, Che Guevara's Argentinian lieutenant and the person who more than other has been blamed in history books as guilty of Che's death.
When captured in Bolivia, Bustos drew Ches portraits of Che Guevara and his guerrillas for the Bolivian army. Providing his interrogators with drawings framed Bustos as a traitor by historians but was according to his version part of a misleading strategy adopted under interrogation. After living in Sweden in silence for some thirty years, "Sacrificio" was the first documentary he took part in.
"Sacrificio" confronts Busto's version of the events with the surviving protagonists of Che Guevara's death and raises questions about how history has been written. Sacrificio stars several of the main characters surrounding the capture and killing of the Argentinian revolutionary leader, including former CIA agent Felix Rodriguez, former Bolivian General Gary Prado and Che Guevara's executioner Mario Teran.
When released in 2001, "Sacrificio" sparked an international debate concerning Che's death and shed new light on the role played by French intellectual Regis Debray.
Creative documentary.
"Surplus - Terrorized into being consumers".
"Surplus: Terrorized into Being Consumers" from 2003 is a film odyssey about the destructive sides of consumer culture, shot in Sweden, USA, China, India, Cuba, Hungary and Italy over a three-year period and described as "a global doomsday satire set to music". Surplus marked the start of a strong co-operation with composer-editor Johan Söderberg, a regular collaborator of Madonna and creator of the "Read My Lips series".
"Surplus" premiered in competition at the largest documentary film festival IDFA in Amsterdam in 2003 where it won the prestigious Silver Wolf Award.
"Surplus"'s innovative style is the product of a method that Gandini adopts in his very personal approach to documentary film, "the freest, cheapest way for a person to express themselves cinematically".
Although his films deal with social issues they are far from traditional political documentaries. They are "creative documentaries" relying on the idea of "show, don't tell", to give the viewer an experience of politics rather than mere facts, making a powerful use of cinematography, music and editing to make their point.
GITMO.
Gitmo – The New Rules of War is a documentary about the Guantanamo Bay detention camp by Erik Gandini and Tarik Saleh. The film features interviews with Janis Karpinski, Mehdi Ghezali and Geoffrey Miller, among others.
Gitmo premiered at IDFA in 2005, and reached mainstream theaters in Sweden on February 10, 2006. It won a Jury award as best documentary at the 2006 Seattle International Film Festival,
In July 2012, after a suicide bomb attack that left seven people dead in the Bulgarian city of Burgas on a bus carrying Israeli tourists, Gitmo's main character and former Guantanamo detainee Mehdi Ghezali was named in Bulgarian and Israeli media as the main suspect. The Swedish Secret services denied soon after categorically his involvement but his name picture had already been widely exposed in the world press.
"Videocracy".
Erik Gandini's 2009 feature-length documentary "Videocracy" is so far his most successful film. The film, produced and directed by Gandini, explores how Italy has been pushed to the brink of moral melt-down under the rule of Silvio Berlusconi. When it premiered at the Venice International Film Festival, its trailer was banned by Italian state broadcaster RAI, stirring an international controversy.
When widely released in theaters across Italy, it climbed to the fourth position on the Italian Box Office the first week end.
"Videocracy" was voted best documentary film at the Toronto International Film Festival by a critics poll conducted by Indy Wire and chosen as one of best documentaries in 2010 by "The Guardian" top critic Peter Bradshaw.
"The Evilness of Banality".
To explain the cultural phenomenon of Berlusconismo, Erik Gandini coined the expression "The Evilness of Banality", thus paraphrasing Hanna Arendt's banality of evil.
In 2010, Erik Gandini was appointed visiting professor at KAU, University of Karlstad, Gobal Media Studies. Besides his professional career as a director and producer, Gandini lectures extensively about film, politics and media, in Sweden, Italy and around the world.
Recognition.
Erik Gandini is the winner of the 2012 Maj Zetterling award. The prize of 200,000 sek was granted by Swedish Art Council for his "innovation of cinematic language within the documentary genre"
Gandini was also nominated Swedish producer of the year in 2010 competing for the Lorens Award
Gandini has three children with his wife, author and cookbook writer Johanna Westman.

SS Dundee

SS "Dundee" was a steam passenger and cargo ship of the British Merchant Navy. She served during the First World War and was lost in 1917.
Career.
The "Dundee" was built by Caledon shipbuilders at their Dundee yards, and was launched on 24 August 1911. She was completed in November that year and entered service with the Dundee, Perth & London Shipping Company. She sailed for them until the outbreak of the First World War, when she was requisitioned for use as an ocean boarding vessel. She was not a fully commissioned warship of the Royal Navy however, and did not carry the HMS prefix. On 16 March 1917 she was working in the Atlantic with HMS "Achilles", when the German auxiliary cruiser "Leopard" was stopped. The "Dundee" sent out a boat to inspect the disguised vessel, upon which the "Leopard" opened fire and forced "Dundee" to move away. "Achilles" then opened fire on the "Leopard", sinking her in a brief action.
"Dundee"'s career did not last much longer however. On 2 September 1917 she was sighted sailing off the Scilly Isles by "UC-49". The "Dundee" was torpedoed, and duly sank.

PFSweb

PFSweb, Inc. (Priority Fulfillment Services) is an international provider of eCommerce solutions most well known as a leading business-to-business (B2B) and direct-to-consumer (DTC) order fulfillment and customer service provider.
Services offered by PFSweb include:
The company was founded in 1994 in the Dallas suburb of Plano, Texas. PFSweb's corporate headquarters were relocated to Allen, Texas in March 2012 with call center operations moved to downtown Dallas, Texas.
History.
1994-1998: Origin under Daisytek.
PFSweb, Inc. was founded in 1994 as Priority Fulfillment Services, Inc. (PFS) by Texas-based Daisytek International Corporation, a leading wholesale distributor of computer and office automation supplies such as printer ribbons, toner cartridges, and computer disks. The new unit was initially created to perform order-processing, fulfillment, and telemarketing services for other companies, due to a growing demand for outsourcing in this area. Soon after its formation, PFSweb was chosen to perform telemarketing and distribution services for IBM product lines throughout North America.
PFSweb soon began to take on additional clients, and Daisytek doubled the size of its own "superhub" warehouse/shipping center in Memphis, Tennessee in part because of the unit's success.
1999-2001: European expansion and PFSweb emerges.
In January 1999 the company formed a European division, PFSweb Europe, with 10 employees working at a call and fulfillment center in Maastricht, Netherlands, and also launched a new division to offer order fulfillment services to internet-based retailers. It was targeted toward both web-based and brick-and-mortar firms who were adding web ordering capabilities and needed to quickly get systems and staff in place.
In Mid-1999, the parent firm Daisytek began selling shares of the firm on NASDAQ, capitalizing on the market frenzy for Internet stocks
In early December 1999 one-fifth of the company, now bearing the name PFSweb Inc., highlighted its e-commerce capabilities, was sold in an initial public offering (IPO). Mark Layton, the 40-year-old CEO of Daisytek, who had recently published a book called "“.coms or .bombs ... Strategies for Profit in e-Business”", took the titles of president, CEO, and chairman of PFSweb, while remaining the board chairman of Daisytek.
In late July 2000, PFSweb introduced the Entente Suite of software, which offered full e-commerce support from web site interface to back-office accounting functions, customizable to meet each customer's needs. PFSweb also added managed hosting and web site development services to its offerings. To accomplish the former, the firm established a secure data center.
2002-2004: Online expansion and company layoffs.
In February 2002 PFSweb began offering customized manufacturing and supplier inventory services to further support its clients. In June, PFSweb sign a five-year contract with the Smithsonian Institution's Business Ventures unit to provide fulfillment services for catalog and web orders. An alliance was also formed with eBay that would allow PFSweb's clients to distribute their products via that firm's online auction site. The company was now working to cut costs after losing key clients as the .com bubble burst, and in the summer laid off 60 employees, paring its total staff to about 550.
In June, 2004, PFSweb, Texas, and Raytheon Aircraft Company jointly announced that PFSweb would perform fulfillment services at the Raytheon Aircraft Parts Inventory & Distribution (RAPID) facility.
In August 2004 the company signed a lease on a warehouse/shipping center in Southaven, Mississippi, which was located near its Memphis superhub site. The firm had been in a dispute with Memphis officials since 2003, when former parent company Daisytek had gone bankrupt and tax breaks for the Memphis site that had been granted to that firm ended. When an appeal to re-acquire the tax breaks was denied, the firm had begun seeking a new location outside of Memphis.
2005-2007: Adding eCOST.com and Asia expansion.
In June, 2005, PFSweb launched its dynamic new corporate website located at http://www.pfsweb.com/.The website reflected the company's position as a leading business process outsourcing (BPO) provider.
In November 2005, PFSweb and eCOST.com announced that they have entered into a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) signifying the merger of PFSweb and eCOST.com. Under the terms of the merge, PFSweb issued eCOST.com shareholders one PFSweb common share for each outstanding share of eCOST.com in a tax-free, share-for-share transaction. As a result, eCOST.com became a wholly owned subsidiary of PFSweb. The merger was officially completed in February 2006.
In 2006 PFSweb named Michael Willoughby as the President of the company and acquired several notable clients, including LEGO, Roots Canada Ltd, and Katun Canada.
PFSweb, Inc. announced in April 2007 that it is expanding its customer care services operations with a new customer call center in the Philippines. The new facility, located in downtown Manila, initially housed the customer service department for eCOST.com, but on a case-by-case basis the services of this location was also offered to PFSweb clients.
2008-2010: Partnerships and new clients.
In early 2008 PFSweb formed a partnership with Demandware to assist in targeting the e-commerce technology market - the purpose is for Demandware’s e-commerce platform to supplement PFSweb’s fulfillment and customer care services. PFSweb integrated the technology with its existing services, allowing PFSweb to enter into the marketplace of End-to-End (E2E) suppliers with PFSweb's End2End eCommerce® solution.
PFSweb announced in April 2009 a five-year agreement had been reached with Army & Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) to provide a comprehensive global fulfillment solution that supports the All Services Exchange Catalog and Online Store.
On January 15, 2010, it was announced that PFSweb and Procter and Gamble (P&G) had joined together to launch an online store. Named the “eStore”, this online shopping site will be owned and operated by PFSweb and will exclusively feature P&G products for sale to consumers in the United States. The eStore is planned to launch in the spring of 2010, pending a pilot of the site with 5,000 consumers which is currently underway.
On April 7, 2010, Carter's, Inc. selected PFSweb to operate their innovative multi-brand web store along with their high-touch customer care services, fully branded order fulfillment and comprehensive financial transaction management for both the Carter’s and OshKosh B'Gosh brands.
2011-Present: Sale of eCOST.com and the launch of iCommerce.
On February 22, 2011 it was announced that PFSweb had completed the sale of certain assets of eCOST.com to a new subsidiary of PC Mall, Inc. for $2.3 million. In addition, PC Mall has contracted with PFSweb to provide a variety of e-commerce services, including IT and customer care, to support PC Mall's newly acquired eCOST.com operations on a temporary basis. PFSweb announced on March 22, 2011 its partnership with luxury brand kate spade New York using its End2End eCommerce offering. This eCommerce effort was unique for PFSweb due to the kate spade New York website featuring not only an eCommerce storefront but also a collaborative "play" section focused on content instead of products. PFSweb also announced on September 15, 2011 its global relationship with the Clarins Group and on January 4, 2012 an agreement with L'Oréal USA to launch and manage eCommerce sites for a portfolio of brands including Kiehl's, Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent Beauté, and Giorgi Armani Beauty. In March 2012 Gerber Childrenswear announced their updated eCommerce website using PFSweb's End2End eCommerce solution and in April 2012 PFSweb announced an agreement with Elizabeth Arden.
PFSweb announced more clients in 2012 including Amer Sports Group and its Suunto brand, W. L. Gore and Associates and its BIKE WEAR and RUNNING WEAR brands, and Pandora A/S. The company also received another supplier of the year award from Riverbed and launched its new iCommerce solution through a partnership with Shopatron to create an omni-channel commerce solution. At the end of 2012 it was announced PFSweb was selected to launch and support eCommerce solutions for Kraft Foods brands Gevalia and Tassimo.
In February 2013 PFSweb acquired its first iCommerce client in BCBGMAXAZRIAGROUP and also launched a branded eCommerce site for spirits and alcoholic beverage producer Diageo. The following month PFSweb announced a leadership change as Mike Willougby replaced Mark Layton as CEO of the company. One of Willoughby's first actions as CEO was the forming of a relationship with Japanese company transcosmos, who also made a $14.7 million investment in PFSweb. New clients so far in 2013 include TJX Companies, L'Oréal brands em michelle phan and Clarisonic, and the United States Mint.
Culture.
PFSweb has partnered with the several charities in the past, including the United Way and the Children’s Advocacy Center of Collin County. During the holiday season, PFSweb employees volunteer within their communities on behalf of the United Way and have pledged more than $60,000 to support the mission of United Way of Metropolitan Dallas. PFSweb is also an active participant in the Richardson Corporate Challenge, an Olympic style competition involving up to 22 athletic and non-athletic events. In 2013, PFSweb launched the SPARK program to assist people in need in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
The company has also received several accolades, including a "Quality Supplier" award from Xerox, an ASPire award for "best management and operations practice", and a top 5 ranking in the Deloitte & Touche Technology Fast 500. PFSweb was also awarded the 2009 "Technology Supplier of the Year" award by Riverbed Technology.
After receiving a $300,000 grant from the city of Dallas in 2011, PFSweb relocated their call center operation from Plano, Texas to Dallas, Texas, residing in the 56-story Renaissance Tower directly in Downtown Dallas. PFSweb also relocated its corporate headquarters in March 2012 from Plano, Texas to Allen, Texas.

Charles Le Goffic

Charles Le Goffic (1863–1932) was a French poet, novelist and historian whose influence was especially strong in his native Brittany. He was a member of the Académie française.
Biography.
Born in Lannion, his childhood was spent with his nurse, either in Perros-Guirec, or in Trégastel. In October 1888, he married Julie Fleury. Following a legal judgement in his favour he bought a farm at Run-Rouz in Trégastel. He worked as a teacher in Gap, Évreux, Nevers and in Le Havre. In 1886, he founded with Maurice Barrès and Raymond de Tailhède the literary review "Les Chroniques". Goffic wrote widely about aspects of Breton and broader Celtic cultural identity, emphasising the importance of local traditions and cultural continuity. His short stories "Passions Celtes" (1910) were widely influential on the Breton cultural renaissance. One of them was dramatised by Le Goffic at the request of Guy Ropartz for the libretto of his opera Le Pays.
Politically close to Charles Maurras, he collaborated on the "Revue d'Action française" (1899), which later became "L'Action française" (1908). Although a convinced republican, his militant regionalism and his traditionalist ideals led him to support the "Maurrassisme" project to restore the monarchy, as his letter published in "L'Enquête sur la monarchie" (1900) testifies.
Goffic was elected member of the Académie française in 1930. 
In 1895 he introduced the Great Highland Bagpipe to Brittany. 
He is interred in the enclosure of the church of the borough of Trégastel, with his wife and their daughter, who died at the age of 17.

Avshar Turkmen

Avshars are a branch of the Turkic Oghuz groups in Anatolia and Azerbaijan, which are also called Turkmen. These originally nomadic Oghuz tribes moved from Central Asia and finally settled in Azerbaijan and Anatolia.
According to the legends, Oghuz Turks are formed from two main branches: Ucok and Boz ok (meaning Three Arrows and Gray Arrows). These two branches consisted equal numbers of "boy", meaning smaller tribes. Avshar Turkmens are believed to belong to the Gray Arrow branch and Avshar was himself, according to the Oghuz Kagan legend, the son of the Yildizhan (Star-Khan), one of the 6 sons of Oghuz Kagan. (mentioned and listed in Mahmud Kashgari's Divanu-Lugat-it Turk, 11th century).
Avshars shared the same history with other Oghuz tribes until entering the Anatolia. Until the 10th century, they are believed to have lived along the banks of the Syr Darya (Seyhun) river and on the northern steppes of the river. Beginning from the 9th century, they started migrating towards west. Avshars are believed to have entered Anatolia after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. They settled in various places in Anatolia. During the Mongol invasion in the following period, some Avshar tribes migrated to Syria and later formed what was called Halep Turkmens, which eventually migrated back to Anatolia and settled there. 
Avshars lived under the authority of the State they lived in, but they also formed great local dynasties which behaved independent in internal affairs. Avshars are mentioned as one of the few Oghuz "boy" tribes who had a strong political influence, the others are being the Kayı tribe who founded the Ottoman Empire and Kinik Tribe who founded Seljuk Empire.

Monuments.
The village has a wooden parish church dating from the second half of the sixteenth century, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. This church was initially located in Wola Grzymalina, a now-extant neighboring village. However, due to the extension of the coal mine around Belchatow, the largest open cut coal mine in Poland, the church was transported to its current location in 1981-1982. It had been inscribed in the national register of historic monuments of Poland in 1967.
Restoration works were performed both on the interior walls, which still display an original mural painting of the "danse macabre", as well as on the wooden altar.
Remnants of a fortified house, dating from the fifteenth/sixteenth century, can be found on the land of the current elementary school.

1989 Cotton Bowl Classic

The 1989 Mobil Cotton Bowl Classic was a college football bowl game played on January 2, 1989, at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas, USA. The game was played on January 2, the day after New Year's Day, since New Year's Day fell on a Sunday. The bowl game featured the Arkansas Razorbacks from the Southwest Conference and the UCLA Bruins from the Pacific-10 Conference and was televised in the United States on CBS. Troy Aikman, the UCLA quarterback and LaSalle Harper, an Arkansas linebacker were named the Most Valuable Players of the game.
Game invitation.
Arkansas Razorbacks.
The 1988 Arkansas Razorbacks football team was undefeated through Southwest Conference play. In the final regular season game, the #3 Miami Hurricanes defeated the Razorbacks 16-18. Arkansas was invited to the Cotton Bowl Classic as the winner of the Southwest Conference. Arkansas played in its first Cotton Bowl Classic since the 1976 Cotton Bowl Classic.
UCLA Bruins.
Going into the UCLA-USC rivalry game, UCLA was 9-1 and had been ranked #1 for a couple of weeks earlier. Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose Bowl MVP had a crucial fumble in the UCLA vs Washington State game, when the #1 ranked Bruins were upset at home by the Cougars 34-30. The game was one of the notable ones in the UCLA-USC rivalry in that it was for the Pac-10 championship, a possible Heisman Trophy for either Troy Aikman of UCLA or Rodney Peete of USC. It was also for the Rose Bowl berth. Rodney Peete was found to have measles in the days before the game. USC used a strong ground game and "bend but don't break" defense, in front of the largest Rose Bowl Stadium regular season crowd in history, to beat the Bruins 31-22. The Cotton Bowl Classic agreed to take the team that would not be going to the 1989 Rose Bowl. UCLA was the first Pac-10 team to play in the Cotton Bowl Classic and first from the West Coast since the 1949 Cotton Bowl Classic where the University of Oregon played SMU.
Pre-game buildup.
The 1989 game between UCLA and Arkansas was highly publicized in the Dallas area because UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman was expected to be the #1 pick in the NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys. Much was made of Cowboys coach Tom Landry watching Aikman practice at Texas Stadium (UCLA's practice facility for game preparation). 
Game summary.
First quarter.
No Score
Aftermath.
UCLA Bruins quarterback Troy Aikman completed 19 of 27 passes for 172 yards, and Bruin teammate Shawn Wills rushed for 120 yards. UCLA held Arkansas to four first downs and 42 yards, the lowest yardage total in Arkansas school history.
Tom Landry never got to draft Aikman, because he was fired the next month, but his successor, Jimmy Johnson, did draft Aikman.

Measuring programming language popularity

It is difficult to determine which programming languages are most widely used, and what usage means varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one have more lines of code, a third may utilize the most CPU time, and so on. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large mainframes; FORTRAN in engineering applications; C in embedded applications and operating systems; and other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.
Methods.
Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:

2009 Premier League Darts

The 2009 Whyte & Mackay Premier League was a darts tournament organised by the Professional Darts Corporation.
The tournament kicked off at the Echo Arena Liverpool which hosted the biggest ever crowd for a PDC event of almost 8,000 in 2008.
New venues in Edinburgh and Exeter joined some of the UK's biggest arenas, including Belfast's Odyssey, the Manchester Evening News Arena, Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, the Sheffield Arena and Newcastle's Metro Radio Arena.
The tournament came to a conclusion with the play-offs on Monday 25 May at the Wembley Arena – coinciding with the Football League play-offs at the neighbouring Wembley Stadium over the same weekend. Phil Taylor was defending his Whyte & Mackay Premier League title once again, however he failed to retain it after losing to Mervyn King 10–6 in the semi-finals. James Wade beat King 13–8 in the final, to claim the £125,000 first prize and the first Premier League not to be claimed by Taylor.
Qualification.
The top six players from the PDC Order of Merit following the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship were confirmed on 5 January. Jelle Klaasen and Wayne Mardle were named as the two Sky Sports wild card selections on 9 January.
Qualifiers are as follows:

Notes.
† – Wayne Mardle didn't play in week ten because of a virus. John Part played two matches in week ten, with Mardle due to play two in week eleven. However, Mardle was rushed into hospital with mumps on 15 April, which ruled him out of week eleven. This means that Mervyn King and James Wade played twice during week eleven, with Mardle now due to make up five matches in the last three weeks. He had been due to play two matches in both weeks thirteen and fourteen, giving King the night off in Sheffield, and Wade in Cardiff. However, he was re-admitted to hospital, and in accordance with tournament regulations, was removed from the tournament. His results from the tournament so far were also annulled. In order for each remaining night to have four matches, there was a series of challenge matches featuring Robert Thornton, Adrian Lewis, Dennis Priestley, Mark Webster and Gary Anderson.

The Man Within (film)

The Man Within is a 1947 British, Technicolor, adventure, crime, drama film, directed by Bernard Knowles and starring Ronald Shiner as Cockney Harry, Michael Redgrave, Jean Kent, Joan Greenwood and Richard Attenborough. It was produced by Triton Films and Production Film Service. The film was also presented by J. Arthur Rank and the Rank Organisation. Also, the film was adapted from the 1929 novel, The Man Within by Graham Greene.
Plot summary.
This adventure film is a film about smugglers. Filmed in lavish Technicolor, The Man Within is a rousing tale of smugglers, betrayal and redemption. The story is told from the point-of-view of Seaman Andrews (Richard Attenborough), the ward of 19th-century smuggler chieftain, Carlyon (Michael Redgrave). Feeling persecuted by his stern disciplinarian guardian, Seaman Andrews jumps ship and turns Carlyon over to the customs officials. A deadly fight ensues, during which both Andrews and Carlyon escape and head their separate ways. Upon befriending the stepson of a customs agent who was killed by Carlyon, Andrews agrees to testify against his onetime friend and protector in court. To bind the bargain, Lucy (Jean Kent), mistress of the Crown's Attorney, makes love to the impressionable, misguided Andrews. Finally realizing that the forces of justice are no more ethical than his fellow smugglers, Andrews refuses to testify against Carlyon, and is himself thrown into prison. Incredible though it may seem, a happy ending results from all this intrigue. In the United States of America, The Man Within was released in a slightly shorter version, retitled The Smugglers.

Boeing XAT-15

The Boeing AT-15 was an American twin-engined bomber crew trainer designed and built by Boeing's Wichita Division. Only two prototypes, designated XAT-15, were built. Plans to build over 1,000 were cancelled on the United States' entry into the Second World War. The proposed name "Crewmaker" was not officially adopted.
Development.
One of the first projects for the former Stearman Aircraft Company which in 1939 had become the Wichita Division of Boeing was a twin-engined trainer for bomber crews. Designated X-120 by the company two examples were ordered by the United States Army Air Corps as the XAT-15. The AT-15 was a high-wing cantilever monoplane with two wing-mounted Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp radial engines. It had a retractable tailwheel landing gear and an extended glazed fuselage nose for the trainee bomb-aimer. Due to shortage of materials the aircraft was built of welded steel tube covered with plywood and wooden wings and tail unit. The two aircraft were delivered to the USAAC but after the country's entry into the war a change in priorities resulted in the planned order for more than 1,000 aircraft not being placed.

BRISPEC sting operation

The Bribery and Special Interest (BRISPEC) sting operation was a sting operation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigating corruption in the California State Legislature from 1986 to 1988. The operation was also known as Shrimpscam because FBI agents posed as representatives of a West Sacramento-based shrimp processing company who gave campaign contributions to law makers in exchange for favorable legislation to the front company. A couple of the bills were actually passed by both the Assembly and Senate, but were vetoed by Governor George Deukmejian, who was tipped off in advance.
The operation sent Board of Equalization member Paul Carpenter to prison. In addition to Carpenter, three members of the state legislature also spent jail time: Pat Nolan, who was the minority leader at the time of the raid, as well as State Senator Joseph Montoya and Assemblymember Frank Hill.
Speaker Willie Brown and Assemblymember Gwen Moore were also targeted by the operation, but emerged unscathed. Brown had a $1000 campaign contribution shoved under his door returned to the donor. Moore's office was raided as part of the sting operation, but she was eventually acquitted of any wrongdoing.

The Cup (TV series)

The Cup is a British television programme starring Steve Edge, Pal Aron and Jennifer Hennessy. It is based on the Canadian TV series The Tournament. The show is presented as a mockumentary, and features an Under-11s football team aiming to succeed in a prestigious national tournament - amidst friction between the various parents and club staff.
Plot outline.
Terry McConnell is desperate for his 10-year-old son, Malky, to get a trial for Bolton Wanderers - so desperate that Malky misses a training session. And, even though he is joint leading scorer, Malky is dropped from Ashburn United's league decider. Terry moves heaven and earth to persuade coach Tom Blackley to relent and play Malky from the start, but Tom's blood pressure is rising fast, and he soon succumbs to a stroke. McConnell forces club owner Sandra Farrell to allow him to manage, ahead of fellow player dad and gynaecologist Dr. Kaskar, and he leads the team to victory. With Blackley critically ill, the club attempts to organise a benefit for him, while McConnell and Kaskar continue to chase the regular manager's job (each unwilling to be a 'co-coach', and each wanting to get his own son into the team). Farrell instead awards it to the French-born coach at the local school.
Farrell Funeral Directors reveal that they can no longer fund the club's trip to Birmingham for the Under 11's Cup competition. Despite Terry's best attempts to raise money for the trip, they all prove fruitless. He then suggests that they use the money raised for Tom Blackley to fund the trip, an idea previously thrown out by the group of parents; with no other option, they quickly begin to warm to the idea, and take back Tom's money to travel to Birmingham. On the journey there, Terry wonders how he can get the Bolton scout to visit, and decides to take his wife's saved money to book him a room. Despite having stolen the money and later being found out by his wife the scout, Hinchcliff fails to arrive, and rumours that their new French coach is gay generate much excitement, before they are dispelled.

No My Darling Daughter

No My Darling Daughter is a 1961 British comedy film directed by Ralph Thomas and featuring Michael Redgrave, Michael Craig, Roger Livesey, James Westmoreland, and Juliet Mills. It was based on the play "Handful of Tansy" by Kay Bannerman and Harold Brooke.
Plot.
Wealthy businessman and single parent Sir Michael Carr (Michael Redgrave) does not know how to deal with his daughter Tansy (Juliet Mills), at that awkward age between teenager and adult. His close friend and employee ex-General Henry Barclay (Roger Livesey) has the same kind of problem with his son. Thomas Barclay (Michael Craig) left the military and has now tendered his resignation from Carr's automobile company.
Tansy chances to meet American Cornelius Allingham (James Westmoreland) at her father's office. The two teens soon become inseparable friends; she shows him around London, with her father blithely unaware of the relationship. When Carr has to go on a business trip to New York, he sends Tansy along with General Barclay on his fishing vacation in Scotland. She secretly arranges for Cornelius to meet her there. The two see the sights on his motor scooter and eventually go camping together (he sleeps outside the tent), without informing anyone. When Carr realises his daughter is missing, he finds some photographs of Cornelius, assumes the worst, and gets the police to initiate a nation-wide manhunt.
Thomas, who had earlier resented having to get Tansy out of her various scrapes, uses his army training and tracks the pair down. He sneaks up, knocks Cornelius out, and takes a resisting Tansy back to London.
When Cornelius wakes up, he discovers he is wanted by the police. He turns himself in to Carr, then reveals that he is the millionaire son of Carr's business associate and that he holds a sizable number of shares in Carr's own company. Relieved that his daughter hadn't been seduced by a fortune 
hunter, Carr gives his blessing to their marriage. However, Thomas discovers that he is in love with Tansy; when he kisses her, she realizes she feels the same about him and they elope. General Barclay is furious at first, having gone to great lengths to arrange the wedding, until Carr reminds him that this was what they had hoped for.

List of celebrities involved with WrestleMania

WrestleMania is a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), formerly known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The events feature wrestlers from the promotion's roster competing in a variety of professional wrestling match types, performances with pre-determined outcomes between wrestlers with fictional personalities that are portrayed as real for the entertainment of the audience. The WrestleMania franchise debuted in 1985 with WrestleMania I, and has been produced annually since then. WrestleMania XXVIII is the most recent production.
Aside from professional wrestling performances, celebrity involvement has been a major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more hype and media attention for the event, in this way receiving more attraction to the event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role. 
One of the first celebrities to appear at the first WrestleMania was Mr. T, who wrestled in the main event in a tag team match with Hulk Hogan. Aretha Franklin appeared at the third WrestleMania and sang a rendition of "America the Beautiful." Franklin appeared 20 years later at WrestleMania 23 and sang another rendition of the same song. At times, WWE has inducted celebrities into their Hall of Fame. For example, Chicago Bears defensive lineman William Perry wrestled in a match that involved other NFL football players, and he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a "Celebrity Inductee" in 2006. Another celebrity was Mike Tyson, who appeared at WrestleMania XIV and was originally planned to enforce the ringside area, although he was involved in a physical altercation with Shawn Michaels (Michael Hickenbottom). Pete Rose has made the most celebrity appearances at WrestleMania, with four overall appearances. Overall, there have been 99 celebrities involved at WrestleMania: 32 athletes, 29 musicians, 19 actors, and 20 others from different backgrounds.

I'm a Jayhawk

I'm a Jayhawk is the fight song of the University of Kansas. 
History.
The original lyrics and music were written by George "Dumpy" Bowles in 1912. The lyrics to the song are generally not sung, instead fans do a specific clap as the KU band plays the melody. The university bands do not play the intro, but only play the chorus of the song.
The song was updated in 1958 to reflect the teams of the Big 8 Conference. The lyrics were rewritten again in 2010 to account for the departure of Nebraska and Colorado from the Big 12 Conference.
Lyrics.
The official lyrics to "I'm A Jayhawk!" are as listed below.
Talk about the Sooners
The Cowboys and the Buffs,
Talk about the Tiger and his tail,
Talk about the Wildcats,
and those Cyclone boys,
But I'm the bird to make 'em weep and wail.
CHORUS:
'Cause I'm a Jay, Jay,
Jay, Jay, Jayhawk,
Up at Lawrence on the Kaw
'Cause I'm a Jay, Jay,
Jay, Jay, Jayhawk,
With a sis-boom, hip hoorah.
Got a bill that's big enough
To twist the Tiger's tail
Rope some horns and listen
To the Red Raiders wail.
'Cause I'm a Jay, Jay,
Jay, Jay, Jayhawk,
Riding on a Kansas gale.

Lucy C. Laney Comprehensive High School (Laney High School) is a public high school located in the Laney-Walker district of Augusta, Georgia (United States). It was formed in 1949 by combining th A. R. Johnson and Haines Normal and Industrial Institute. This combination merged what was seen as the best of both schools and with that, Laney derived the mascot, the "Wildcat", and the school colors of red and grey.
In summer 1951, the old building was torn down on the Haines site and the new building was started. During the construction, classes were held at another site. In September 1953, Lucy Laney High School moved into its new building with Dr. Tonia Y. Mason as principal. In 1964, the Music Building was added with spacious new choral and band rooms. In 1981, renovations were made to the building to update the library facilities and the main offices. Air conditioning was installed.
During the 1996-97 school year, work started on a renovation for school improvements costing approximately seven million dollar. The new construction added ten new classrooms including a technology lab, a new media center, the expansion of the gym with a concession area, and new restrooms and new furnishings. The new facilities were completed during the 1997-98 school year.

Springs Station was established in 1780 in the area of Beal's Branch of Beargrass Creek in what is now Louisville, Kentucky. It was established at the time of the founding of Louisville as part of the settlement's defensive network of six forts, to protect settlers from attack by the Indians who were allied with the British.
Springs Station was built by a family named Steele. They came to Kentucky from Pennsylvania on a flatboat in 1780. Richard and Martha Steele lived at Spring Station and had thirteen children. Richard had been granted land as payment for military service. Mrs. Steele became a pioneer heroine when she saved her wounded husband after an Indian attack at Springs Station. Tradition has it that she left the safety of Floyd's Station and traveled at night with a small child in the vicinity of Indian camps to aid her husband at Springs Station.

Junkers A 32

__NOTOC__
The Junkers A 32 was a mail plane built in prototype form in Germany in the late 1920s, and later developed as a prototype reconnaissance-bomber under the designation K 39. The design was a conventional low-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed tailskid undercarriage. Construction was metal throughout, with corrugated duralumin skin. Three open cockpits were provided in tandem; the third seat intended from the outset to accommodate a tail gunner for a military version of the aircraft. In fact, the militarised version developed in Sweden by AB Flygindustri featured a fourth crew position as well, for a bombardier. This version featured twin machine guns built into the engine cowling, and a trainable machine gun for the tail gunner.
Only two A 32s were built, and the first prototype was destroyed in a crash on 2 November 1927 that killed Junkers engineer Karl Plauth. The sole K 39 constructed may have been modified from the second prototype. No sales of either the civil or military version ensued.

Pacific goliath grouper

The Pacific goliath grouper ("Epinephelus quinquefasciatus") is a large saltwater fish of the grouper family. It is a relative to the Atlantic goliath grouper. 
The Pacific goliath grouper is found primarily in shallow tropical waters among coral and artificial reefs at depths of up to 165 feet (50 m). Their range includes the area from the Gulf of California to Peru.
Young groupers may live in brackish estuaries, and canals. 
They may reach extremely large sizes, growing to lengths of 8.2 feet (2.5 m) and can weigh as much as 800 pounds (363 kg). They are usually around 400 lb when mature. The goliath grouper's inquisitive and generally fearless nature make it a relatively easy prey for spear fishermen. They also tend to spawn in large aggregations returning like clockwork to the same locations making them particularly vulnerable to mass harvesting. Unlike its cousin, the Atlantic goliath grouper, the Pacific grouper was relatively unharmed by fishing but it still will probably warrant protection soon.
Goliath groupers eat crustaceans, other fish, octopuses and young sea turtles. Grouper are preyed upon by large fish such as barracuda, moray eels and large sharks.
Goliath groupers are believed to be protogynous hermaphrodites, with individuals first maturing as females and only some large adults becoming males. Most grouper follow this pattern, but it has not yet been verified for the goliath. In fact, Bullock et al. found that males could be sexually mature at smaller sizes (~1150mm) and younger ages (4-6 years) than females (~1225mm and ~6-8 years).

Morning Departure

Morning Departure (released as Operation Disaster in the United States) is a 1950 British naval drama film about life aboard a sunken submarine, directed by Roy Ward Baker, and starring John Mills and Richard Attenborough. It is based on a stage play with the same name by Kenneth Woollard, which had also been shown as a live TV play by the BBC both in 1946 and 1948.
Plot.
The story is set after the end of the Second World War and concerns a British submarine, HMS "Trojan", which is out on a routine exercise to test its new snorkel mast when it encounters a derelict floating mine left over from the war. Unfortunately, it is a magnetic mine, and the submarine does not need to hit it before it becomes a danger. The sub dives, but eventually sets off the mine and it blows the bows of the sub completely off, and at the same time floods the after section through the displaced snorkel mast, instantly killing all 53 of the crew in the bows and stern section. The sub settles to the bottom leaving twelve crew members alive amidships, who have been saved by the watertight doors which had been closed by order of the captain when he realised the imminent danger.
When the shore base becomes aware that "Trojan" is overdue, surface rescue vessels are sent out to investigate. The captain of the sub, Lieutenant Commander Peter Armstrong (John Mills), sensibly provides an indication of their position to these vessels by expelling a quantity of oil which rises to the surface. Following standard escape procedure, a diver is sent down with an air line while everyone prepares for the rescue. Armstrong selects the first four for release, and they escape safely without incident, and are picked up on the surface. The eight remaining crew assume there are plenty of breathing sets for them all to escape successfully. However, the captain discovers that all but four have been destroyed in the blast. This means the final four will have to remain under water until a full salvage operation can be carried out, which may take a week or more.
Armstrong assembles the others to draw lots through a pack of cards he deals out, to decide who goes and who remains. Two, the cook and the first lieutenant, Lieutenant Manson (Nigel Patrick), with the lowest cards, select themselves to stay behind along with Armstrong. The top three, to go first, also select themselves with high cards. Of the other two, there is a tie, both knaves, between Stoker Snipe (Richard Attenborough) and E.R.A. Marks (George Cole). On losing a re-deal, young Snipe goes berserk with fear and has to be physically restrained. Armstrong approaches Marks and asks if he will forfeit his place for Snipe, sensing difficulties if Snipe is left behind. Marks agrees.
They begin to prepare for escape, but Snipe now hangs back, falsely claiming he has hurt his arm in the scuffle. He insists that Marks should go. Marks and the other three escape safely through the hatch and are picked up by the salvage vessels. Below, Manson has a fainting fit but Snipe catches him using both arms without difficulty. Cheerfully at first, the four begin the wait for the salvage operation.
Above, all goes well to begin with, in fine weather. Divers manage to secure cables under the sub, which is slowly winched up, but only fifteen feet per day can be achieved. However, as the days go by, the weather turns, and soon there is a full storm at sea. As a result, the sub shifts on the cables, and sinks again to the floor of the sea. Manson has remained in ill-health below, nursed with care by Snipe. However his bunk is located next to what becomes a chlorine gas leak, and, overcome, Manson dies.
The storm is so bad that the captain of the salvage ship decides his own men are at risk, and abandons the salvage operation altogether. The three left in the sub sense that there is no hope for them. The film ends with Armstrong reading from a Naval prayer book.
From early scenes in the film, and from dialogue throughout, the viewer is given insights into the personal and home lives of the crew, their hopes and now thwarted ambitions. For example, Snipe is married to a wayward wife, whom he idolises; whilst Armstrong has been offered a lucrative shore job by his wealthy father-in-law, and had been planning to leave the Navy to take it up as soon as this patrol was over.
Production.
The film is based on a very popular stage play at the time, by Kenneth Wollard. Beside several stage setups around Britain, it had already been made as a live TV play by the BBC, first on 1 December 1946, with an afternoon rerun two days later, and was shown twice again by the BBC in February 1948 with a different cast. Nigel Patrick, who plays 1st Officer Manson in the film, played the captain in the first TV version.
In the play, the captain's name is Stanford, but for the film it was changed to Armstrong. Most other characters retained their names in the film version, although the film also has additional characters, due to the flash back scenes and scenes from the rescue operation on the surface. The stage play has an all male 14 character cast, while the film has a credited cast of 20 (plus a few uncredited minor roles), which also includes three women.
"HMS" Tiptoe was used for the external submarine shots. The opening titles feature a statement about the decision to release the film in the light of the loss of HMS "Truculent". HMS "Trucelent"
sank in 1950, after an accidental collision with a freighter which resulted in the loss of 64 lives. The HMS "Truculent" incident took place after filming of "Morning Departure" had been completed, but before it went on general release to the public. The producers decided to go ahead with the film release, as a tribute to the bravery and fortitude of Royal Naval personnel.
In 1959, Dutch broadcaster NCRV also made a TV play from the stage play, titled "S.14 vermist" ("S.14 missing").

Bob Randall (baseball)

Robert Lee Randall (born June 10, 1948) is a former professional baseball second baseman. He played five seasons in Major League Baseball from 1976 until 1980, all for the Minnesota Twins.
Randall was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in three separate drafts: 1966, 1968, and finally the 2nd round in 1969, after which he signed. For the next five and a half years, he worked his way through the Dodgers' farm system, never playing at the major league level. Then, he got his first break, being traded to the Twins in exchange for reserve outfielder Danny Walton.
Randall's second, and even more important, break was the Twins' decision to move future Hall of Famer Rod Carew to first base, opening up second base for Randall, who beat out Jerry Terrell for the job in spring training. Randall capitalized on the opportunity, batting .267 in 153 games in 1976 while finishing 4th in the American League in sacrifice hits.
That turned out to be the high mark of Randall's career. He spent the next two seasons splitting time at second base with Rob Wilfong, losing the starting job to the lefty-hitting Wilfong entirely in 1979. The following spring, he was released by the Twins, but was resigned in May. He played in just five games in the majors in 1980, going 3-for-15, before being released, and Randall retired soon afterwards.
Following Randall's major league career, he turned to the college coaching ranks. He was head baseball coach at Iowa State University from until 1995, and at the University of Kansas from until 2002. He is currently the assistant baseball coach and a professor of economics at Manhattan Christian College.

Fishing in Bhutan

A less productive but still significant food source resulted from fishing, both from cold-water streams and lakes (primarily trout) and warm-water fisheries (primarily carp). A growing demand for fish as a dietary supplement was reported in the mid-1970s following a 1974 FAO aquaculture study and a 1976 FAO survey of rivers and lakes to determine the level of fish stock. Fisheries were developed, and carp were imported from Assam. In 1977 the Department of Animal Husbandry established a Fishery Development Programme, initially for stocking rivers with game fish and for developing commercial capability as a long-term goal. Between 1979 and 1987, an average of 1,000 tons of fish were caught or produced annually. Another FAO survey was conducted in 1981, and the government included fishery development for the first time in the Fifth Development Plan. The Integrated Fisheries Development Project was started at Geylegphug in 1985. The National Warm Water Fish Culture Centre supplied fish to farmers, and some twenty-one tons of carp were produced at fisheries for local and national consumption. To control cold-water fishing, the Department of Forestry issued fishing licenses and enforced seasonal and fishsize prohibitions.

Forestry in Bhutan

One of Bhutan's significant natural resources in the late twentieth century was its rich forests and natural vegetation. Bhutan's location in the eastern Himalayas, with its subtropical plains and alpine terrain, gives it more rainfall than its neighbors to the west, a factor greatly facilitating forest growth. The forests contain numerous deciduous and evergreen species, ranging from tropical hardwoods to predominantly oak and pine forests.
Conservation.
The small population and the general absence of overdevelopment in Bhutan contributed to forest preservation. Because of the terrain, the more accessible forests had been overcut whereas remote forests remained largely in their natural state. A progressive government-sponsored forestry conservation policy strove to balance revenue needs with ecological considerations, water management, and soil preservation. Success in managing its forest resources had long been critical to the local environment and economy and also affected downstream floodplains in India and Bangladesh.
The Department of Forestry was established in 1952 to oversee conservation and exploitation of the country's significant forestry resources. After an initial decade of development, forestry resource exploitation increased with the start of the First Development Plan in 1961. Uncontrolled felling of trees in the 1970s by private companies in logging areas and by rural populations along roads and in main valleys stripped hillsides and caused serious erosion. Tsheri cultivation, forest fires, and overgrazing also contributed to the degradation of the forestry resource.
In 1971 the Forestry School was established at Kalikhola in southern Bhutan. It was moved to Taba in the northern Thimphu Valley in 1977. The school provided basic instruction in forestry and forest management and trained foresters and Forest Guards.
In 1981 some 33,000 km², or between 70 and 74 percent of the land, were forested, but in 1991 foreign estimates indicated a shrinking forest of only 60 to 64 percent of the land. Even more conservative estimates indicated that closer to 50 percent of Bhutan's territory still was forested in the late 1980s, and about 15 percent of GDP was produced through the nation's important forest industry.
According to UN statistics, in the decade between 1978 and 1987 Bhutan harvested an average of nearly 3.2 million cubic meters of roundwood and produced 5,000 cubic meters of sawn wood per year. Of this total, nearly 80 percent was for commercial use (paper pulp, veneers, plywood, particle board, and firewood), and the remainder was for housing construction and public works.
Conscientious Forestry.
Before hydroelectric power and other modern energy sources were available, wood was the almost exclusive source of fuel for heating, cooking, and lighting. The provision of electricity, as well as better regulation of fuelwood collectors and more aggressive reforestation projects, was seen in the 1980s as a key factor in forest conservation. Because affordable electricity was not available throughout the country, the government established fuelwood plantations near villages to accommodate daily needs and to promote forest conservation.
Recognizing the potential value of its forestry resource, Bhutan became increasingly conscientious about forestry management in the 1970s. Starting in 1977, the World Wildlife Fund began supporting Bhutan's forest management through organizing forest ranger training programs, supplying funds for forest boundary demarcation, building guard posts, and constructing a patrol road for what was later to be designated the Royal Manas National Park. Bhutan rejected World Bank aid to build a major dam on the Manas Chhu in 1986 that would have flooded this major conservation area on the southern Bhutan-India border. By 1989 Bhutan had developed nine other forest and wildlife preserves, also mostly along the southern border with India.
Banning & Standards.
In the face of increasing denuded hillsides, private logging was banned, and strict standards for public-sector logging operations were established in 1979. Farmers were warned against burning off forests to clear land for tsheri cultivation, and Forest Guards were trained in increasing numbers to help preserve the valuable resources. Surveying, demarcation, conservation, and management plans for harvesting forest products were part of the Fifth Development Plan's focus on forestry preservation. Wildlife sanctuaries also were developed. One of the immediate results of forestry sector regulation, however, was a sharp decrease in revenues since the late 1970s. In 1991 the government, with assistance from UNDP and the World Wildlife Fund, established a trust fund for environmental conservation. Initially in the amount of US$20 million, the UNDP-administered fund was aimed at producing up to US$1 million per year for training in forestry and ecology, surveying forests, reviewing and implementing management plans for protected areas, and supporting government environmental offices, public awareness programs, and integrated conservation and development programs.

The Meeting of Waters () is the confluence between the Rio Negro, a river with dark (almost black colored) water, and the sandy-colored Amazon River or Rio Solimões, as it is known the upper section of the Amazon in Brazil. For 6 km (3.7 mi) the river's waters run side by side without mixing. It is one of the main tourist attractions of Manaus, Brazil. The same also happens near Santarém, Pará with the Amazon and Tapajós rivers.
This phenomenon is due to the differences in temperature, speed and water density of the two rivers. The Rio Negro flows at near 2 km per hour at a temperature of 28°C, while the Rio Solimões flows between 4 to 6 km per hour a temperature of 22°C.

Indian famine of 1899–1900

[[File:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of the
British Indian Empire (1909), showing the different provinces and native states. The Central Provinces and Berar, Bombay Presidency, Ajmer-Merwara, and the Hissar district of the Punjab were especially hard-hit by the
"Indian famine of 1899–1900"]]
The Indian famine of 1899–1900 began with the failure of the summer monsoons in 1899 over west and Central India and, during the next year, affected an area of and a population of 59.5 million. The famine was acute in the Central Provinces and Berar, the Bombay Presidency, the minor province of Ajmer-Merwara, and the Hissar District of the Punjab; it also caused great distress in the princely states of the Rajputana Agency, the Central India Agency, Hyderabad and the Kathiawar Agency. In addition, small areas of the Bengal Presidency, the Madras Presidency and the North-Western Provinces were acutely afflicted by the famine.
The population in many areas had barely recovered from the famine of 1896–1897. As in that famine, this one too was preceded by a drought. The Meteorological Office of India in its report of 1900, stated, "The mean average rainfall of India is . In no previous famine year has it been in greater defect than . But in 1899 the defect exceeded 11 inches." There were also large crop failures in the rest of India and, as a result, inter-regional trade could not be relied upon to stabilise food prices.
The resulting mortality was high. In the Deccan, an estimated 166,000 people died, and in the entire Bombay Presidency a total of 462,000. In the Presidency, the famine of 1899–1900 had the highest mortality—at 37.9 deaths per 1000—among all famines and scarcities there between 1876–77 and 1918–19. Overall, in British areas alone, approximately 1,000,000 individuals died of starvation or accompanying disease; in addition, as a result of acute shortage of fodder, cattle in the millions perished. Other estimates vary between 1 million and 4.5 million deaths.
Cause.
In the Central Provinces and Berar, an area that had suffered extreme distress during the famine of 1896–1897, the year 1898 had been favourable agriculturally, as was the first half of 1899; however, after the failure of the summer monsoon of 1899, a second catastrophe began soon afterwards. There was a rapid rise of prices and the autumn kharif harvest failed completely. After public criticism of the famine relief effort in the previous famine, this time an improved famine relief effort was organised; by July 1900, one-fifth of the province's population was on some form of famine relief. The summer monsoon of 1900 produced moderately abundant rainfall, and by autumn, agricultural work had begun; most famine-relief works were consequently closed by December 1900. Overall, the famine of 1899–1900 was less severe in this region than the famine of two years before. In the Bombay Presidency, the reverse was the case: the famine of 1899–1900, which affected a population of 12 million, was more acute, especially so in the Kathiawar Agency. The recovery from the famine in the Presidency was also very slow.
Epidemics.
Both 1896 and 1899 were El Niño years—years in which the monsoon rainfall was considerably less than average. The year following the El Niño, also called a Niño+1 year, has historically been recognised to have not only higher than average rainfall, but also a much higher probability of malaria epidemics. For example in the Punjab province of British India, of the 77 years from 1867 to 1943, there were 21 El Niño years, 11 of whose Niño+1 years produced malaria epidemics; in contrast, there were only six malaria epidemics in the remaining 56 non-El Niño years. "Fever years follow famine years" had become a popular saying in the Punjab long before Sir Ronald Ross, working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, showed in 1898 that the malaria parasite, "Plasmodium falciparum", is transmitted by mosquitoes. It had also been noted, by R. Christophers in 1911, that years in which the monsoon was abundant, but which had not been preceded by famine years, were not likely to be epidemic years. These observations had prompted some scholars to theorise that the increased malaria mortality in a post-famine year was the result of lowered resistance to malaria caused by the malnutrition. However, it is now thought likely that the dry famine years decreased human exposure to mosquitoes, which thrive in stagnant water, and consequently to "Plasmodium falciparum"; the decreased exposure resulted in lowered immunity among the population, thereby making subsequent exposures all the more devastating.
In 1900, a Niño+1 year, malaria epidemics, occurred in the Punjab, Central Provinces and Berar, and the Bombay Presidency, with devastating results. In the Central Provinces and Berar, the death rates were initially quite low. The "Report on the Famine in the Central Provinces in 1899–1900" noted the "extreme healthiness of the first four months of the famine, September to December 1899." The low mortality indicated the absence of malaria in 1899; however, by the summer of 1900, an epidemic of cholera had begun, and soon the monsoon rains of 1900 brought on the malaria epidemic. Consequently, the death rate peaked between August and September 1900, a full year after the famine began. In the Bombay Presidency, the same pattern of pre-monsoon cholera followed by post-monsoon malaria in 1900 was repeated. The "Report on the Famine in the Bombay Presidency, 1899–1902" pronounced the epidemic to be "unprecedented," noting that "It attacked all classes and was by no means confined to the people who had been on relief works ..."
Usury.
The British had established control over Western India in the early decades of the 19th century; this consisted of direct administration of the conquered territories in the expanded Bombay Presidency as well as in the British outpost of Ajmer-Merwara farther north. The middle decades of the 19th century saw not only the implementation of a new system of land revenue and land rights in these areas, but also the establishment of new civil law. Under the new land rights system, peasants could be dispossessed of their land if they failed to pay the land-revenue (or land-tax) in a timely fashion. The British, however, continued to rely on local "Baniya" usurers, or "Sahukars", to supply credit to the peasants. The imposition of the new system of civil law, however, meant that the peasants could be exploited by the "sahukars", who were often able, through the new civil courts, to acquire title-deeds to a peasant's land for non-payment of debt.
The mid-19th century was also a time of predominance of the economic theories of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, and the principle of "laissez-faire" was subscribed to by many colonial administrators; the British, consequently, declined to interfere in the markets. This meant that the "Baniya" "sahukars" could resort to hoarding during times of scarcity, driving up the price of food grain, and profiteering in the aftermath. All this occurred in Western India during the famine of 1899–1900.
In Khaira District in present-day Gujarat, many peasants were forced to hand over their lands to the "sahukars" as security for meager loans that not only didn't grant them much relief, but that they later couldn't repay on account of exorbitant interest. The "sahukars" were to foreclose on these loans in the years after the famine; in the princely state of Baroda, for example, the recorded land-transfers were to jump from an average of 13,000 per year during the decade of the 1890s, to over 65,000 during the year 1902–1903.
The "sahukars", in their effort to drive up prices, were even able to export grain "out" of areas of scarcity using the faster means of transport that came in with British rule. Here again the colonial administrators declined to intervene, even though they themselves often disapproved of the practice. This happened, for example, in the Panchmahals—one of the worst famine-afflicted areas in 1900—where a railway line had been built in the 1890s. A British deputy district collector recorded in his report, "The merchants first cleared large profits by exporting their surplus stocks of grain at the commencement of the famine, and, later on by importing maize from Cawnpore and Bombay and rice from Calcutta and Rangoon." He went on to record that the "sahukars" were building new houses for themselves from these windfall profits. The blatant profiteering, however, led to grain riots in the Panchmahals by Bhil tribals, and grain riots became a feature of other British-ruled areas during times of famine. This contrasted markedly with the princely states, where the authorities often did intervene. For example, in Jodhpur State, a famine-stricken area in Rajputana, in August 1899, the state officials set up a shop to sell grain at cost price, forcing the "Baniya" merchants to eventually bring down their prices.
Economic changes.
The Indian famine of 1899–1900 was the last of the all-India famines. (The war-time Bengal famine of 1943 was confined mainly to Bengal and some neighbouring regions.) The famine proved to be a watershed between the overwhelmingly subsistence agriculture economy of 19th century India and a more diversified economy of the 20th century, which, by offering other forms of employment, created less agricultural disruption (and, consequently, less mortality) during times of scarcity.
The construction of the Indian railways between 1860 and 1920, and the opportunities thereby offered for greater profit in other markets, allowed farmers to accumulate assets that could then be drawn upon during times of scarcity. By the early 20th century, many farmers in the Bombay presidency were growing a portion of their crop for export. Wheat, both food and cash crop, saw increased production and export during this time; in addition, cotton and oil-seeds were also exported. The railways also brought in food, whenever expected scarcities began to drive up food prices.
There were other changes in the economy as well: a construction boom in the Bombay presidency, in both the private and public sectors, during the first two decades of the 20th century, created a demand for unskilled labour. There was greater demand for agricultural labour as well, brought on both by the planting of more labour-intensive crops and the expansion of the cropped area in the presidency. Real agricultural wages, for example, increased sharply after 1900. All these provided farmers with greater insurance against famine. During times of drought, they could now seek seasonal non-agricultural employment; alternatively, they could temporarily move to areas where there was no drought and work as agricultural wage labourers.
According to , "Famines in the nineteenth century tended to be characterized by some degree of aimless wandering of agriculturalists after their own supplies of food had run out." Since these migrations caused further depletion among individuals who were already malnourished and since new areas exposed them to unfamiliar disease pathogens, the attendant mortality was high. In the 20th century, however, these temporary migrations became more purposive, especially from regions (in the Bombay Presidency) that were highly drought prone. A greater availability of jobs throughout the presidency and a better organised system of famine relief offered by the provincial government allowed most men in afflicted villages to migrate elsewhere as soon as their own meager harvest had been collected. McAlpin further notes:Villages are reported to have housed only women and children, and old men in some years of crop failure. Those left behind could tend the livestock, live off the short harvest, and expect that the government would step in to provide relief—including grain sales or gratuitous relief—if necessary. With the beginning of the next agricultural season the men would return to the village with some earnings from their outside employment which could be used to resume agricultural operations. In most cases, the livestock would also have been preserved through the actions of women and children.
Mortalilty.
In the Deccan, an estimated 166,000 people died, and in the entire Bombay Presidency a total of 462,000. In the Presidency, the famine of 1899–1900 had the highest mortality—at 37.9 deaths per 1000—among all famines and scarcities there between 1876–77 and 1918–19. According to the "Imperial Gazetteer of India", overall, in British areas alone, approximately 1,000,000 individuals died of starvation or accompanying disease; in addition, as a result of acute shortage of fodder, cattle in the millions perished in the famine. According to author David Fieldhouse, over 1 million people may have died during the famine of 1899–1900; according to anthropologist Brian Fagan, up to four and a half million people may have died during the famine .
The following table gives the varying estimates of total famine related deaths between 1896 and 1902 (including both the 1899-1900 famine and the famine of 1896–1897).
The Lancet's estimates were criticised by writer and retired Indian Civil Servant Charles McMinn, arguing that it was based on a mistake of the population increase in India from 1891-1901.

Westland Widgeon (fixed wing)

The Westland Widgeon was a British light aircraft of the 1920s. A single engined parasol monoplane, the Widgeon was built in small numbers before Westland abandoned production in 1929.
Development and design.
In 1924, the British Air Ministry, eager to encourage the development of cheap civil aircraft suitable for use by private owners and flying clubs, sponsored a competition for a two seat ultralight aircraft, which had to be powered by an engine of 1100 cc displacement or less and capable of carrying a load of at least 340 lb (155 kg). To meet this requirement, Westland Aircraft produced two designs, the Woodpigeon biplane, and the Widgeon parasol monoplane. Unable to decide which design would be superior, Westland decided to build both types.
The Widgeon first flew at Westland's Yeovil factory on 22 September 1924, eight days after the first of two Woodpigeons. Its fuselage, which was very similar to that of the Woodpigeon, was of mixed steel tube and wooden construction, while the wooden parasol wing, which was tapered in both chord and thickness, folded for easy storage. It was powered by a single 1,090 cc Blackburne Thrush three cylinder radial engine, which produced 35 hp (26 kW).
The Air Ministry Light Aircraft competition began at Lympne Aerodrome, Kent on 27 September. The Widgeon, which due to the use of the Thrush engine was badly underpowered (as was the Woodpigeon), crashed during the first day of trials. Despite this setback, it was clear that the Widgeon had promise and was superior to the Woodpigeon, and the damaged prototype was rebuilt with a more powerful 60 hp (45 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Genet engine as the Widgeon II. Despite its much greater weight, the new engine transformed the Widgeon, the rebuilt aircraft being almost 40 mph (64 km/h) faster.
Based on this experience, Westland decided to enter the Widgeon into production for the private owner. It was therefore redesigned with a simpler, constant chord, wing replacing the tapered wing of the Widgeon I and II to ease production. The resulting Widgeon III could be powered either a radial engine like the Genet or an inline engine such as the Cirrus. The first Widgeon III flew in March 1927, with production starting later that year. The design was further refined with a duralumin tube fuselage and a new undercarriage to produce the Widgeon IIIA. 
The Widgeon proved expensive compared to its competitors and a total of only 26 of all types, including the prototype, were built and sold before production was stopped in 1930 in order to allow Westland to concentrate of the Wapiti general purpose military aircraft and the Wessex airliner.

Rozprza

Rozprza is a village in Piotrków County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Rozprza. It lies approximately south of Piotrków Trybunalski and south of the regional capital Łódź. The village has a population of 1,400.
Rozprza has a very long history, as it is one of the oldest Slavic gords of Poland. It used to be the seat of a castellan, and its name probably comes from the Old Slavic word “rozprza”, which means the subject of an argument, and which indicates that in the early Middle Ages Rozprza had a castellan court.
In the early years of Polish statehood, this part of central Poland belonged to the Province of Leczyca, and the province itself was divided into eight castellanies, one of which was seated at Rozprza. The Rozprza Castellany had the area of 1,150 km2., and its southern part was uninhabited. In the early Middle Ages, Rozprza was located at the intersection of two busy merchant routes, from Gdansk to Krakow, and from Rus to Sieradz and Kalisz. The gord itself lied at the edge of a large wilderness, and served as a toll collection point for merchants and their wagons. The gord of Rozprza was probably established in the 6th century, to be destroyed in unknown circumstances in the 9th century. A new stronghold was built in the same spot, which was probably destroyed by the Polans in the mid-10th century. 
In the second half of the 10th century, a system of the so-called service villages was established in Polish castellanies. In the Castellany of Rozprza there were such villages as Wozniki (manufacture of wagons), Piekary (bread baking), Bartodzieje (honey making), and Ciesle (woodworking). Rozprza itself was completely remodelled, with a new 12-meter wide moat and a wide rampart. Altogether the defensive system of the gord was some 30 meter wide. First documented mention of Rozprza comes from the year 1065, when during the reign of King Boleslaw II the Generous, Rozprza was obliged to pay a fee to a Benedictine Abbey at Mogilno. In the Bull of Gniezno (1136), Rozprza is described as an important center of trade, commerce and administration. 
Rozprza was destroyed in the mid-13th century, probably during the Mongol invasion of Poland. The stronghold was quickly rebuilt, with a large garrison, which is confirmed by archaeological findings. Finally, west of the gord, the town of Rozprza was established before the year 1344. Due to proximity of quickly developing Piotrkow Trybunalski, Rozprza remained a small town, whose population was app. 300 in the late 18th century. After the Partitions of Poland, Rozprza briefly belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia, and from 1815 until 1915, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1846-47, Rozprza received rail connection due to construction of the Warsaw-Vienna Railway. Following the January Uprising, Rozprza lost its town charter and has remained a village.

Betta

Betta is a large genus of small, often colorful, freshwater ray-finned fishes in the gourami family (Osphronemidae). The type species is "B. picta," the spotted betta.
By far the best known "Betta" species, however, is "B. splendens," the Siamese fighting fish.
Characteristics.
All the "Betta" species are small fishes, but they vary considerably in size, ranging from under 2.5 cm (1 in) total length in "B. chanoides" to 12.5 cm (5 in) in the Akar betta ("B. akarensis").
Bettas are anabantoids, which means they can breathe atmospheric air using a unique organ called the labyrinth. This accounts for their ability to thrive in low-oxygen water conditions that would kill most other fish, such as rice paddies, slow-moving streams, drainage ditches, and large puddles.
The various bettas can be divided into two groups, based on their spawning behaviour: some build bubble nests, such as "B. splendens," while others are mouthbrooders, such as "B. picta." The mouthbrooding species are sometimes called "pseudo bettas", and are sometimes speculated to have evolved from the nest-builders in an adaptation to their fast-moving stream habitats.
Name.
Much confusion in terminology often occurs regarding these fish. Siamese fighting fish, "B. splendens", are frequently sold in the United States simply as "bettas". Fish fanciers are thus often unaware that, , around 65 species are classified within the genus "Betta". A further source of confusion is that while the generic name "Betta" is italicized and capitalized, when used as a common name it is usually neither italicized nor capitalized.
The common name of "B. pugnax," for example, is thus Penang betta.
The name "Betta" (or betta) is pronounced ; the first part is the same as the English word bet. By confusion with the name of the Greek letter beta, the name is often pronounced in American English, and may be misspelled with one 't'. The name of the genus is unrelated to that of the Greek letter, being derived from the Malay word "ikan betah" ("persistent fish").
Habitat.
The betta is native freshwater fish from Thailand (formerly Siam) and Cambodia (formerly Kampuchea). Wild bettas can often be found in a small pond, river, or drain. 
Diet.
Wild "Betta" fish are hardy and can eat almost anything in their environments, including worms, larvae of mosquitoes or other insects, and even smaller fish. Their natural environment is often resource-limited, so many "Betta" species have little choice of food.
Conservation.
While many "Betta" species are common and "B. splendens" is ubiquitous in the aquarium trade, other bettas are threatened. The IUCN Red List classifies several "Betta" species as Vulnerable. In addition, "B. livida" is Endangered, and "B. miniopinna," "B. persephone," and "B. spilotogena" are Critically Endangered.
The United Nations Environment Programme lists an unconfirmed species, "Betta" cf. "tomi," as having become extinct in Singapore between 1970 and 1994.
This likely refers to the extirpated Singaporean population of "B. tomi," which continues to exist in the wild in Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as in captivity; the Red List classifies it as Vulnerable.
Species.
The currently described "Betta" species can be grouped into complexes for conservation purposes. (This grouping of species makes no claim at representing a phylogenetic reality.) The complexes of the associated species are:
Also, several known populations do not have valid species status, such as "Betta" sp." machachai" from the "B. splendens" complex. These may be described as valid species in the future.

Fantom (programming language)

Fantom is a general purpose object-oriented programming language created by Brian and Andy Frank that runs on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), JavaScript, and the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) (.NET support is considered "prototype" status). Its primary design goal is to provide a standard library API that abstracts away the question of whether the code will ultimately run on the JRE or CLR. Like C# and Java, Fantom uses a curly brace syntax. The language supports functional programming through closures and concurrency through the Actor model. Fantom takes a "middle of the road" approach to its type system, blending together aspects of both static and dynamic typing.
Typing.
Fantom's type system is simple by design. All variables are statically typed, as they are in C# and Java. Fantom rejects generic types due to their complexity, but it does have a set of built-in generic types: List, Map, and Func. Fantom can also take on the feel of a dynamically typed language through dynamic calls and automatic downcasting. Fantom has an easy to use reflection API and metaprogramming capabilities.
Fantom is open source under the Academic Free License 3.0 and is available for Windows and Unix-like platforms (including Mac OS X).
Pods.
In Fantom, the unit of deployment is called a "pod". Pods take on the role of namespaces, packages, and modules. They are stored as .pod files, which are zip files containing the FCode (the Fantom bytecode), the documentation, and resource files necessary to run the pod. A pod can define any number of types for use in other libraries and applications. A pod name fully qualifies a type name. For example, fwt::Widget is distinct from webapp::Widget. If a pod contains a type named Main, then it can be executed on the command line with: fan <podName>
The Fantom build system can package a set of Pods into a JAR archive through build::JarDist.
Fantom Widget Toolkit.
Fantom ships with a standard windowing toolkit called the Fantom Widget Toolkit, or FWT for short. Like Fantom, FWT was designed to be portable across several platforms. It is currently implemented on the JVM using the Standard Widget Toolkit as a backend. The Javascript implementation is backed by the canvas element and JavaFX, allowing FWT applications to be run in a web browser. There are plans for a CLR implementation using Windows Forms.
"Hello World" example.
Here is the classic Hello world program written in Fantom:
Notice that "Void" is capitalized. This is because Void is a class, not a primitive type in Fantom.
Name change.
The original name of the Fantom programming language was Fan, named after the neighborhood where the creators live in Richmond, Virginia. After gaining some popularity members of the community raised concerns about the searchability of the name. In November 2009, the name of the project was officially changed from Fan to Fantom.
Other features.

He won two German football championships and played 15 times in the German national team. Harder was a former SS officer and had been a warder at the Ahlem concentration camp in Hanover.
Career.
Harder spent most of his career with "Hamburger SV". His football fame in Germany was comparable with Uwe Seeler's fame. After his football career Harder was an SS-Untersturmführer (equivalent second lieutenant) and was a commander ("Schutzhaftlagerführer") at the Ahlem camp. After World War II Harder was convicted of war crimes by the British military court at the "Curio house" in Rotherbaum. He was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. After the trial the "Hamburger SV" excluded him for a short time. In 1951 His Majesty 's Government pardoned Harder. Harder moved to Bendestorf.
Harder died in a hospital in Hamburg after surgery in 1956. The "Hamburger SV" published an obituary 
For the world cup in 1974, the senate of Hamburg published the booklet "Hamburg '74. Fußballweltmeisterschaft", which praised among others Josef Posipal, Uwe Seeler and Harder as role models for the young. The sheets mentioning Harder were removed.

Royal Naval Armaments Depot

A Royal Naval Armament Depot (RNAD) was a group of armament depots dedicated to supplying the needs of the Royal Navy as well as the Royal Air Force, British Army and foreign/commonwealth governments; they were sister depots of Royal Naval Cordite Factories, Royal Naval Torpedo and Royal Naval Mine Depots. Between 1965 and 1994, they were part of the Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service (RNSTS).
Most RNADs were located near to Royal Navy Dockyards to facilitate the transfer of armaments between the depot and the warships; but not too close to minimise the risk of any accident or explosion in the depot causing damage to warships. The term "RNAD" is no longer in use, except for RNAD Coulport which is the UK Strategic Weapon Facility for the Trident Missile System. The RNSTS has also ceased to exist firstly being renamed the 'Warship Support Agency' and, presently, known as part of the 'Defence Equipment and Support' (DE&S) conglomerate. Those RNADs (except Coulport) that are still in use today are known as Defence Munitions centres (DM), e.g. DM Beith.
History.
Predecessors.
The earliest Naval Ordnance Depots, which later became RNADs, were built by the Board of Ordnance. Many were former forts with large gunpowder magazines and other facilities, such as at Priddy's Hard and Upnor Castle. The Board of Ordnance was responsible for all forts and armaments within the United Kingdom as well as the British Empire. When the Board of Ordnance was abolished in 1855, control passed first to the War Office, then in 1891 to the Admiralty.
On 1 January 1965 control of the armament depots passed to the Ministry of Defence and they became part of the Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service (RNSTS). The RNSTS was formed from an amalgamation of the Directorates of Naval Stores, Victualling, Armament Supply, and Movements.
Disbandment of the RNSTS.
On 1 April 1994, the RNSTS ceased to exist and was absorbed into the Naval Support Command. The RNADs also lost their independence.

<doc id="18969691" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18969691" title="Intentionally blank page">
Intentionally blank page

An intentionally blank page is a page that is devoid of content, and may be unexpected. Such pages may serve purposes ranging from place-holding to space-filling and content separation. Sometimes, these pages carry a notice such as, "This page intentionally left blank." Such notices typically appear in printed works, such as legal documents, manuals and exam papers, in which the reader might otherwise suspect that the blank pages are due to a printing error and where missing pages might have serious consequences.
Uses for intentionally blank pages.
Print media.
Intentionally blank pages are usually the result of printing conventions and techniques. Chapters conventionally start on an odd-numbered page; therefore, if the preceding chapter happens to have an odd number of pages, a blank page is inserted at the end. Book pages are often printed on large sheets because of technical and financial considerations. Thus, a group of 8, 16, or 32 consecutive pages will be printed on a single sheet in such a way that when the sheet is mechanically folded and cut, the pages will be in the correct order for binding. This is called an even working, and the group of pages is called a section or signature. Books printed in this manner will always have a number of pages which is a multiple of the number in such a signature, such as a multiple of 8, 16, or 32. As a result, these books will usually have pages left blank, unless by chance or editorial ingenuity the exact number of pages are printed.
For example, if a book with 318 pages of content is printed using 32-page signatures, it will require 10 signatures, 320 pages in total. At the very end of the book — that is, at the end of the last signature — there will be 2 unused (blank) pages.
If a printer's document processor has been designed to skip completely blank pages, notices may also be required on intentionally blank pages to prevent incorrect page numbering.
Intentionally blank pages are ubiquitous in technical and instructional manuals, directories, and other large, mass-produced volumes of text. The contents of manuals produced by a given product's vendor are often compiled from generic instructions suitable for a variety of products, with additional instructions or chapters included for the specific product or model in question. This automation of manual-generation leads to intentionally blank pages required to fit the requirements for mass printing.
In digital documents, pages are intentionally left blank so that the document can be printed correctly in double-sided format, rather than have new chapters start on the backs of pages. Intentionally blank pages have also been used in documents distributed in ring binders. The intention is to leave room for expansion without breaking the document's page numbering. This allows updates to be made to a document while requiring minimal new pages, reducing printing costs. The only drawback is the increased time required by the reader to manually insert various newly updated pages into their correct locations in the document.
Standardized tests.
Intentionally blank pages can be useful in standardized tests such as the GCSE, Higher School Certificate, SAT, CAT, ACT, MCAT, and GRE. In these exams, there are often individual, timed sections in which test-takers are prohibited from proceeding to the next section until that section's time interval has passed and the examiner allows them to continue. Because all of these separate sections are printed consecutively in the examination booklet, it may be possible for a test-taker who has finished the section early to see through the page and read the problems in the next section. By placing intentionally blank pages between these sections, the test-taker is prevented from cheating in this way. By printing a notice on the page, such as "this page has been intentionally left blank", test-takers will not be concerned that their test has been misprinted, especially as test instructions often instruct students to check for missing or blank pages and to report any defective test booklets to a proctor.
Sheet music.
In books of sheet music, pieces of relatively short music that can span two to four pages often need to be arranged so the number of page turns for the performer is minimized. For example, a three-page work (starting on the left hand sheet) followed immediately by a two-page work involves one page turn during each work. If a blank page immediately followed the three-page work (on the right hand sheet), the two-page work will span the left and right pages, alleviating the need for a page turn during the second work. Intentionally blank pages may also appear to prevent a page turn during a difficult passage.
Classified documents.
In the United States armed forces, classified documents require page checks whenever custody is transferred or an inventory is conducted. Blank pages are all marked "This page intentionally left blank" so page checks are unambiguous and every page of the document is accounted for.
Variations.
Intentionally blank pages placed at the end of books are often used to balance the folios which make up the book (see bookbinding). Often these pages are completely blank with no such statement, or are used as "Notes" pages, serving a practical purpose. In the case of telephone number directories, these pages are often used to list important numbers and addresses. In novels, pages may list other books available from the same publisher.
Book publishers have also used stylized designs (dingbats) underneath the last paragraph of a chapter to indicate that no other content is to be expected until the next chapter, allowing for the possibility of blank pages without misunderstandings by the readers.
Examples.
Andy Griffiths' book "Just Stupid!", begins with a cartoon snail saying to the reader, "This page would be blank if I were not here telling you that this page would be blank if I were not here telling you that..." on an endless loop.
Humorist Don Novello's 1977 book "The Lazlo Letters" ends with several otherwise-blank pages marked "FREE PAPER!".
Comedian Demetri Martin's book "This Is A Book" contains a completely blank page which says, "This page unintentionally left blank."
Iranian novelist Reza Amirkhani's book "Man-e-oo" (His Ego) has one whole chapter of blank pages.

Climate of Svalbard

The climate of Svalbard is principally a result of its latitude, which is between 74° and 81° north. Average July temperatures range from , and in January temperatures are normally between . The North Atlantic Current moderates Svalbard's temperatures, particularly during winter, giving it up to higher winter temperature than similar latitudes in continental Russia and Canada. This keeps the surrounding waters open and navigable most of the year. The interior fjord areas and valleys, sheltered by the mountains, have less temperature differences than the coast, giving about lower summer temperatures and higher winter temperatures. On the south of Spitsbergen, the temperature is slightly higher than further north and west. During winter, the temperature difference between south and north is typically , while only about in summer. Bear Island has average temperatures even higher than the rest of the archipelago.
The archipelago is the meeting place for cold polar air from the north and mild, wet sea air from the south, creating low pressure and changing weather and fast winds, particularly in winter; in January, a strong breeze is registered 17% of the time at Isfjord Radio, but only 1% of the time in July. In summer, particularly away from land, fog is common, with visibility under registered 20% of the time in July and 1% of the time in January, at Hopen and Bear Island. Precipitation is frequent, but falls in small quantities, typically less than in Western Spitsbergen. More rain falls in the uninhabited east side, where there can be more than .
Historical data.
Because of its history of human occupation, Svalbard has one of the longest high-latitude meteorological records on earth. Computer models of global climate have long predicted enhanced greenhouse warming at such latitudes, so the Svalbard record is of particular interest. It shows approximately increase in 100 years; with increase in the last 30 years.
Meteorology.
Traditionally weather had been forecast for Spitsbergen, which because of the needs of expeditions and the governor's activities gave the most extreme weather on the archipelago. This included forecasts for weather-exposed locations such as Hinlopen, Sørkapp and Danskøya. As most people live in the sheltered area of Nordenskiöld Land, the forecast was often regarded as irrelevant. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute started from 14 October 2011 issuing two forecasts, one which is publicly broadcast and covers the main settlements of Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Svea ("Nordenskiöld Land"), and one that covers the entire archipelago ("Spitsbergen").

CP violation

In particle physics, CP violation (CP standing for Charge Parity) is a violation of the postulated CP-symmetry (or Charge conjugation Parity symmetry): the combination of C-symmetry (charge conjugation symmetry) and P-symmetry (parity symmetry). CP-symmetry states that the laws of physics should be the same if a particle is interchanged with its antiparticle (C symmetry), and then its spatial coordinates are inverted ("mirror" or P symmetry). The discovery of CP violation in 1964 in the decays of neutral kaons resulted in the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1980 for its discoverers James Cronin and Val Fitch.
It plays an important role both in the attempts of cosmology to explain the dominance of matter over antimatter in the present Universe, and in the study of weak interactions in particle physics.
CP-symmetry.
"CP-symmetry", often called just "CP", is the product of two symmetries: C for charge conjugation, which transforms a particle into its antiparticle, and P for parity, which creates the mirror image of a physical system. The strong interaction and electromagnetic interaction seem to be invariant under the combined CP transformation operation, but this symmetry is slightly violated during certain types of weak decay. Historically, CP-symmetry was proposed to restore order after the discovery of parity violation in the 1950s.
The idea behind parity symmetry is that the equations of particle physics are invariant under mirror inversion. This leads to the prediction that the mirror image of a reaction (such as a chemical reaction or radioactive decay) occurs at the same rate as the original reaction. Parity symmetry appears to be valid for all reactions involving electromagnetism and strong interactions. Until 1956, parity conservation was believed to be one of the fundamental geometric conservation laws (along with conservation of energy and conservation of momentum). However, in 1956 a careful critical review of the existing experimental data by theoretical physicists Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang revealed that while parity conservation had been verified in decays by the strong or electromagnetic interactions, it was untested in the weak interaction. They proposed several possible direct experimental tests. The first test based on beta decay of Cobalt-60 nuclei was carried out in 1956 by a group led by Chien-Shiung Wu, and demonstrated conclusively that weak interactions violate the P symmetry or, as the analogy goes, some reactions did not occur as often as their mirror image.
Overall, the symmetry of a quantum mechanical system can be restored if another symmetry "S" can be found such that the combined symmetry "PS" remains unbroken. This rather subtle point about the structure of Hilbert space was realized shortly after the discovery of "P" violation, and it was proposed that charge conjugation was the desired symmetry to restore order.
Simply speaking, charge conjugation is a simple symmetry between particles and antiparticles, and so CP-symmetry was proposed in 1957 by Lev Landau as the true symmetry between matter and antimatter. 
In other words a process in which all particles are exchanged with their antiparticles was assumed to be equivalent to the mirror image of the original process.
CP violation in the Standard Model.
"Direct" CP violation is allowed in the Standard Model if a complex phase appears in the CKM matrix describing quark mixing, or the PMNS matrix describing neutrino mixing. A necessary condition for the appearance of the complex phase, is the presence of at least three generations of quarks (if less generations are present, the complex phase parameter can be absorbed into redefinitions of the quark fields).
The reason why such a complex phase causes CP violation is not immediately obvious, but can be seen as follows. Consider any given particles (or sets of particles) formula_1 and formula_2, and their antiparticles formula_3 and formula_4. Now consider the processes formula_5 and the corresponding antiparticle process formula_6, and denote their amplitudes formula_7 and formula_8 respectively. Before CP violation, these terms must be the "same" complex number. We can separate the magnitude and phase by writing formula_9. If a phase term is introduced from (e.g.) the CKM matrix, denote it formula_10. Note that formula_8 contains the conjugate matrix to formula_7, so it picks up a phase term formula_13. Now we have:
However, physically measurable reaction rates are proportional to formula_16, so far nothing is different. However, consider that there are "two different routes" (e.g. intermediate states) for formula_5. Now we have:
Some further calculation gives:
Thus, we see that a complex phase gives rise to processes that proceed at different rates for particles and antiparticles, and CP is violated.
Experimental status.
Indirect CP violation.
In 1964, James Cronin, Val Fitch with coworkers provided clear evidence (which was first announced at the 12th ICHEP conference in Dubna) that CP-symmetry could be broken. This work won them the 1980 Nobel Prize. This discovery showed that weak interactions violate not only the charge-conjugation symmetry C between particles and antiparticles and the P or parity, but also their combination. The discovery shocked particle physics and opened the door to questions still at the core of particle physics and of cosmology today. The lack of an exact CP-symmetry, but also the fact that it is so nearly a symmetry, created a great puzzle.
Only a weaker version of the symmetry could be preserved by physical phenomena, which was CPT symmetry. Besides C and P, there is a third operation, time reversal (T), which corresponds to reversal of motion. Invariance under time reversal implies that whenever a motion is allowed by the laws of physics, the reversed motion is also an allowed one. The combination of CPT is thought to constitute an exact symmetry of all types of fundamental interactions. Because of the CPT symmetry, a violation of the CP-symmetry is equivalent to a violation of the T symmetry. CP violation implied nonconservation of T, provided that the long-held CPT theorem was valid. In this theorem, regarded as one of the basic principles of quantum field theory, charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal are applied together.
Direct CP violation.
The kind of CP violation discovered in 1964 was linked to the fact that neutral kaons can transform into their antiparticles (in which each quark is replaced with the other's antiquark) and vice versa, but such transformation does not occur with exactly the same probability in both directions; this is called "indirect" CP violation.
Despite many searches, no other manifestation of CP violation was discovered until the 1990s, when the NA31 experiment at CERN suggested evidence for CP violation in the decay process of the very same neutral kaons ("direct" CP violation). The observation was somewhat controversial, and final proof for it came in 1999 from the KTeV experiment at Fermilab and the NA48 experiment at CERN.
In 2001, a new generation of experiments, including the BaBar Experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Belle Experiment at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation (KEK) in Japan, observed direct CP violation in a different system, namely in decays of the B mesons. By now a large number of CP violation processes in B meson decays have been discovered. Before these "B-factory" experiments, there was a logical possibility that all CP violation was confined to kaon physics. However, this raised the question of why it's "not" extended to the strong force, and furthermore, why this is not predicted in the unextended Standard Model, despite the model being undeniably accurate with "normal" phenomena.
In 2011, a first indication of CP violation in decays of neutral D mesons was reported by the LHCb experiment at CERN.
Strong CP problem.
There is no experimentally known violation of the CP-symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. As there is no known reason for it to be conserved in QCD specifically, this is a "fine tuning" problem known as the Strong CP problem.
QCD does not violate the CP-symmetry as easily as the electroweak theory; unlike the electroweak theory in which the gauge fields couple to chiral currents constructed from the fermionic fields, the gluons couple to vector currents. Experiments do not indicate any CP violation in the QCD sector. For example, a generic CP violation in the strongly interacting sector would create the electric dipole moment of the neutron which would be comparable to 10−18 e·m while the experimental upper bound is roughly one trillionth that size.
This is a problem because at the end, there are natural terms in the QCD Lagrangian that are able to break the CP-symmetry.
For a nonzero choice of the θ angle and the chiral quark mass phase θ′ one expects the CP-symmetry to be violated. One usually assumes that the chiral quark mass phase can be converted to a contribution to the total effective formula_22 angle, but it remains to be explained why this angle is extremely small instead of being of order one; the particular value of the θ angle that must be very close to zero (in this case) is an example of a fine-tuning problem in physics, and is typically solved by physics beyond the Standard Model.
There are several proposed solutions to solve the strong CP problem. The most well-known is Peccei–Quinn theory, involving new scalar particles called axions. A newer, more radical approach not requiring the axion is a theory involving two time dimensions first proposed in 1998 by Bars, Deliduman, and Andreev.
The strong CP problem may also be solved within a theory of quantum gravity.
Little CP problem.
The little CP problem is a term coined by Lisa Randall. It refers to an issue related to the enhanced new physics contributions to the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron in flavor anarchic models.
CP violation and the matter–antimatter imbalance.
The universe is made chiefly of matter, rather than consisting of equal parts of matter and antimatter as might be expected. It can be demonstrated that, to create an imbalance in matter and antimatter from an initial condition of balance, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied, one of which is the existence of CP violation during the extreme conditions of the first seconds after the Big Bang. Explanations which do not involve CP violation are less plausible, since they rely on the assumption that the matter–antimatter imbalance was present at the beginning, or on other admittedly exotic assumptions.
The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter if CP-symmetry was preserved; as such, there should have been total cancellation of both—protons should have cancelled with antiprotons, electrons with positrons, neutrons with antineutrons, and so on. This would have resulted in a sea of radiation in the universe with no matter. Since this is not the case, after the Big Bang, physical laws must have acted differently for matter and antimatter, i.e. violating CP-symmetry.
The Standard Model contains at least three sources of CP violation. The first of these, involving the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix in the quark sector, has been observed experimentally and can only account for a small portion of the CP violation required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry. The strong interaction should also violate CP, in principle, but the failure to observe the electric dipole moment of the neutron in experiments suggests that any CP violation in the strong sector is also too small to account for the necessary CP violation in the early universe. The third source of CP violation is the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix in the lepton sector. Current neutrino experiments are not yet sensitive to experimental observation of CP violation in the lepton sector, but the NOνA experiment currently under construction could observe some small fraction of possible CP violating phases and proposed neutrino experiments Hyper-Kamiokande and LBNE will be sensitive to a relatively large fraction of CP violating phases. Further into the future, a neutrino factory could be sensitive to nearly all possible CP violating phases.
If neutrinos are Majorana fermions, the PMNS matrix could have two independent CP violating phases leading to a fourth source of CP violation within the Standard Model. The experimental evidence for Majorana neutrinos would be the observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay. As of September 2013, the best limits come from the GERDA experiment. CP violation in the lepton sector generates a matter-antimatter asymmetry through a process called leptogenesis. This could become the preferred explanation in the Standard Model for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe once CP violation is experimentally confirmed in the lepton sector.
If CP violation in the lepton sector is experimentally determined to be too small to account for matter-antimatter asymmetry, some new Physics beyond the Standard Model would be required to explain additional sources of CP violation. Fortunately, it is generally the case that adding new particles and/or interactions to the Standard Model introduces new sources of CP violation since CP is not a symmetry of nature.

Michael Clarke Duncan

Michael Clarke Duncan (December 10, 1957September 3, 2012) was an American actor, best known for his breakout role as John Coffey in "The Green Mile", for which he was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. He was also recognized for his appearances in motion pictures such as "Armageddon", "The Whole Nine Yards", "The Scorpion King" and "Daredevil", as well as voice acting roles in works such as "Brother Bear", "Kung Fu Panda" & "Green Lantern".
Early life.
Duncan was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in a single-parent household with his sister, Judy, and mother, Jean Duncan (a house cleaner), after his father left. He always wanted to act, but had to drop out of the Communications program at Alcorn State University to support his family when his mother became ill. Duncan's large frame—6 feet 5 inches (196 cm) and 315 pounds (142 kg)—helped him in his jobs digging ditches for the People's Gas Company and being a bouncer at several Chicago clubs. Duncan also played basketball at Kankakee Community College and for one season at Alcorn State.
In 1979, he participated in the Disco Demolition Night at Comiskey Park, home of the Chicago White Sox, where he was among the first 100 people to run onto the field and he slid into third base. During the ensuing riot his silver belt buckle was stolen while he was stealing a baseball bat from the dugout.
Career.
Duncan took other security jobs while in Los Angeles while trying to get some acting work in commercials. During this time, he worked as a bodyguard for celebrities like Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J, and The Notorious B.I.G., all the while doing bit parts in television and films. When the Notorious B.I.G. was killed in 1997, Duncan quit this line of work.
After having begun his career with several bit parts playing bouncers in films such as "Bulworth" and "A Night at the Roxbury", Duncan first came to prominence when he was cast as Bear in the blockbuster Michael Bay action film "Armageddon" (1998). During the production of the film, Duncan struck up a friendship with castmate Bruce Willis and it was Willis' influence that helped him to get his breakout role as gentle giant John Coffey in the Frank Darabont-directed "The Green Mile" (1999). Starring alongside Tom Hanks, Duncan's acclaimed performance netted him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture.
Following his iconic dramatic turn as Coffey, Duncan was then cast in a string of films that helped to establish him as a star adept at both action and comedy: "The Whole Nine Yards" (2000), "Planet of the Apes" (2001), "The Scorpion King" (2002) (where he starred alongside his friend, The Rock), and "Daredevil" (2003) (reuniting him with "Armageddon" co-star Ben Affleck) as Wilson Fisk, aka The Kingpin from Marvel Comics.
When Duncan was cast as the Kingpin in 2002, he faced the dual challenge of portraying a typically white character and having to gain 40 pounds to fit the character's large physique. In July 2006, Duncan showed interest in returning for the role of the Kingpin, but stated that he would not be willing to regain the weight that he had lost. In 2009, he stopped eating meat and later appeared in a PETA ad campaign, touting the health benefits and his increased strength from a vegetarian diet.
In 2005, Duncan appeared in two prominent action films, "The Island" (his second Michael Bay Film) and "Sin City" (again alongside Bruce Willis) where he played Manute, a powerful mobster. Critic Roger Ebert singled out Duncan for praise for his role in the Island, writing that "has only three or four scenes, but they're of central importance, and he brings true horror to them." Duncan appeared in a supporting role in the 2006 comedy ' as Lucius Washington and, in 2009, Duncan played Balrog in ' and starred as the titular Cleon "Slammin'" Salmon in Broken Lizard's farce "The Slammin' Salmon".
Famous for his deep baritone, Duncan also provided his voice for a number of roles, for films such as "Brother Bear" (2003) and its sequel, "Brother Bear 2", "Kung Fu Panda" (2008) and "Green Lantern" (2011) playing the voice of Kilowog from DC Comics alongside Ryan Reynolds.
His other voice acting roles include' TV series such as "Loonatics Unleased" and ', Quiznos commercials, and a number of video games such as ', ', ', "Saints Row", "Soldier of Fortune", and "God of War II", where he provided the voice of the Titan Atlas. He additionally reprised his role as the Kingpin in "".
In addition to his film roles, Duncan also guest starred in numerous television shows. Among these, he appeared in an episode of "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody" and a first-season episode of "". In 2008, he appeared as "Mr. Colt" in the second-season premiere of "Chuck", "Chuck Versus the First Date" and as a guest star on two episodes of "Two and a Half Men". Most notably, in April 2011, Duncan guest starred on an episode of TV series "Bones" as Leo Knox which, in 2012, led to Duncan receiving his first starring role as the same character in the spinoff series "The Finder". The "Bones" Season 8 episode "The Partners in the Divorce", which aired three weeks after his death, was dedicated to him.
During the week of May 14, 2012, Duncan appeared on the late night talk show "The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson" as a guest, when the show was taping for a week in Scotland. Duncan was one of the show's most frequent guests, appearing a total of eighteen times, and, the day after Duncan's death in September, Ferguson began his show with a special tribute to him. In January 2013 during the Late Late Show's winter break, reruns of the Scotland episodes were broadcast with a memoriam to Duncan at the beginning of each of the 5 episodes featuring Duncan on a pink background and the text "In memory of our friend Michael Clarke Duncan".
Illness and death.
On July 13, 2012, Duncan was taken to a hospital after suffering a heart attack. Media reports suggested that his girlfriend, Omarosa Manigault, had previously tried to save his life by performing CPR. Duncan's publicist, Joy Fehily, issued a statement on August 6 that read he was moved from the intensive-care unit but remained hospitalized following his heart attack.
On September 3, Duncan died in Los Angeles. Celebrations of Duncan's life were scheduled for a later date. The statement also, for the first time, described Manigault as Duncan's fiancée.
Manigault joined the cast of "The All-Star Celebrity Apprentice" and played in Duncan's honor for his favorite charity and one he had benefited from himself, the Sue Duncan Children's Center. In episode 2 of the season, Manigault won $40,000 for the charity.
