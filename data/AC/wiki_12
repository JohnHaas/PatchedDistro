Paula Fürst

Paula Fürst (August 6, 1894 – probably June 1942) was a German reform educator of Jewish descent.
Education and early development.
Paula Fürst was born in Głogów to Otto Fürst, a Jewish merchant and Malvine Fürst, née Rosenberg. Following the untimely and early death of her father, Paula moved to Berlin together with her mother and her older sister. During her studies in French and History she became acquainted with the principles of Montessori education and was deeply impressed with this "new way of education". She obtained a Montessori diploma through studies in Berlin and Rome and became head of the first Montessori class in Berlin. In addition, she was a frequent lecturer on pedagogical topics.
Life and work under the Nazi regime.
According to Nazi ideology, the Montessori method was mainly propagated by "Jewish elements" and contributed to selfish and anti-national behavior. Consequently, Paula Fürst was forced to resign from her position as teacher in 1933. In the same year, she became head teacher of the Theodor Herzl School of Berlin, a Zionist school with 600 students. As the Nazis tightened the grip on Jewish life in Berlin and Germany, conditions at the Herzl School deteriorated rapidly. Following the Kristallnacht of November 1938, Leo Baeck offered Paula Fürst the position of head of all Jewish schools in Germany which she accepted. She also accompanied many children of the Kindertransport to London but refused to stay abroad although life for Jews in Germany had become unbearable and the beginning of World War II was imminent.
Deportation and death.
Paula Fürst was arrested on June 19, 1942 and deported to Minsk on June 24, 1942 together with 201 people. It is alleged that she died in a death camp, possibly Auschwitz, later that year.

Group contribution method

A group contribution method is a technique to estimate and predict thermodynamic and other properties from molecular structures.
Introduction.
In today's chemical processes hundreds of thousands of components are used. The Chemical Abstracts Service registry lists 56 million substances, but many of these are only of scientific interest.
Process designers need to know some basic chemical properties of the components and their mixtures. Experimental measurement is often too expensive.
Predictive methods can replace measurements if they provide sufficiently good estimations. The estimated properties cannot be as precise as well-made measurements but for many purposes the quality of estimated properties is sufficient. Predictive methods can also be used to check the results of experimental work.
Principles.
A group contribution method uses the principle that some simple aspects of the structures of chemical components are always the same in many different molecules. The smallest common constituents are the atoms and the bonds. The vast majority of organic components, for example, are built of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, and maybe sulfur or phosphorus. Together with a single, a double, and a triple bond there are only ten atom types (not including astatine) and three bond types to build thousands of components. The next slightly more complex building blocks of components are functional groups which are themselves built of few atoms and bonds.
A group contribution method is used to predict properties of pure components and mixtures by using group or atom properties. This reduces the number of needed data dramatically. Instead of needing to know the properties of thousands or millions of compounds, only data for a few dozens or hundreds of groups have to be known.
Additive group contribution method.
The simplest form of a group contribution method is the determination of a component property by summing up the group contribution.
formula_1
This simple form assumes that the property (normal boiling point in the example) is strictly linear dependent from the number of groups and additionally no interaction between groups and molecules are assumed. This simple approach is used for example in the Joback method for some properties and it works well in a limited range of components and property ranges but leads to quite large errors if used outside the applicable ranges.
Additive group contributions and correlations.
This technique uses the pure additive group contributions to correlate the wanted property with an easy accessible property. This is often done for the critical temperature, where the Guldberg rule implies that Tc is 3/2 of the normal boiling point and the group contributions are used to give a more precise value than 3/2.
formula_2
This approach often gives better results than pure additive equations because the relation with a known property introduces some knowledge about the molecule. Commonly used additional properties are the molecular weight, the number of atoms, chain length, and ring sizes and counts.
Group interactions.
For the prediction of mixture properties it is in most cases not sufficient to use a purely additive method. Instead the property is determined from group interaction parameters.
formula_3
where P stands for property and Gij for group interaction value.
A typical group contribution method using group interaction values is the UNIFAC method which estimates activity coefficients. A big disadvantage of the group interaction model is the need for many more model parameters. Where a simple additive model only needs ten parameters for ten groups a group interaction model needs already needs 45 parameters. Therefore a group interaction model has normally not parameter for all possible combinations.
Group contributions of higher orders.
Some newer methods introduce second-order groups. The second-order order groups can be super-groups containing several first-order (standard) groups. This allows the introduction of new parameters for the position of groups. Another possibility is to modify first-order group contributions if specific other groups are also present.
If the majority of Group Contribution Methods give results in gas phase, recently, a new Group Contribution Method was created for estimating the standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔfG′°) and reaction (ΔrG′°) in biochemical systems: aqueous solution, temperature of 25℃ and pH=7 (biochemical conditions). This new aqueous system method is based on the group contribution method of Mavrovouniotis.
A free access tool of this new method in aqueous condition is available on the web.
Determination of group contributions.
Group contributions are obtained from known experimental data of well defined pure components and mixtures. Common sources are thermophysical data banks like the Dortmund Data Bank, Beilstein database, or the DIPPR data bank (from AIChE). The given pure component and mixture properties are then assigned to the groups by statistical correlations like e. g. (multi-)linear regression.
Important steps during the development of a new method are the
The reliability of a method mainly relies on a comprehensive data bank where sufficient source data have been available for all groups. A small data base may lead to a precise reproduction of the used data but will lead to significant errors when the model is used for the prediction of other systems.

Opposite Track Path

Opposite Track Path (OTP) is a technique used in optical technology, which when correctly implemented allows faster (though not un-noticeable) switching from layer 0 to layer 1. 
A dual-layer DVD or Blu-ray disc with Opposite Track Path means that layer 0 is written in a spiral track starting at the inside of the disc reading outwards, whereas the layer 1 spiral starts at the outside of the disc reading inwards. Both tracks are written so that the DVD player will rotate the disc in the same direction. Unlike DVD-ROM discs, DVD video discs are mastered such that layer 0 ends at the same diameter as the layer 1 starts. This means that the layer 1 occupies the end of the layer rather than the start. Thus, although the laser still has to refocus on layer 1, it does not have to seek across the disc to find it. 
With the DVD technology, a small gap is left in the layer 1 track every time it crosses the layer 0 track (twice per revolution). As a result, the data capacity of layer 1 is less than layer 0 which means that a dual layer disc only has a capacity of 8.5 GB instead of the 9.4 GB that might have been expected.
In the case of Blu-ray discs, it was realised that the gap was unnecessary as the laser is perfectly capable of focussing through track 0. Consequently, dual layer Blue-ray discs have double the capacity of their single layer counterparts(50 GB as against 25 GB).

Louisa Knapp Curtis

Louisa Knapp Curtis (October 21, 1851 – February 25, 1910), sometimes known only as Louisa Knapp, was the author of a column, and later, the separate supplement included with the magazine, "Tribune and Farmer", that in 1883 would become a separate magazine, the "Ladies' Home Journal", which is still published. 
Her column in the "Tribune and Farmer" was entitled, "Women at Home". The original name of the separate magazine that arose from the popularity of that column was "The Ladies Home Journal and Practical Housekeeper", but she dropped the last three words from its title in 1886. The magazine became one of the most popular magazines published in the United States, reaching a circulation of one million within ten years.
Curtis remained as the editor of the monthly magazine from its first edition of February 16, 1883 until she turned over the editorship to Edward Bok in 1889, after which she continued to author one featured column and provided a certain amount of oversight, as promised to her readers. 
In 1875, Louisa Knapp married Cyrus Curtis when he was the publisher of "The Peoples Lodge" in Boston. After a fire destroyed that business, they moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1876 where her husband founded the "Tribune and Farmer" and, in 1890, the Curtis Publishing company, which published several magazines. He also published three national level newspapers for a time, through his newspaper company, Curtis-Martin Newspapers, Inc.
Louisa and Cyrus Curtis had one child, Mary Louise Curtis, who married her mother's successor at the "Ladies' Home Journal" in 1896 (and with whom she founded Bok Tower Gardens). Mary Louise founded the Curtis Institute of Music in 1924 as well as, after the death of her father in 1933, the Curtis Hall Arboretum at the family residence, and the Curtis Center in the building from which her mother's magazine was published. In 1930 Edward Bok died and in 1943 she married the director of the Curtis Institute of Music that she had founded, the renowned violinist, Efrem Zimbalist.
Today a facility on Queen Street in Philadelphia is known as the Mary Louise Curtis Branch.

Andrée Christine van Es (born January 26, 1953 in The Hague) is a Dutch politician. She is currently wethouder (alderman) in the executive of the city of Amsterdam for GreenLeft. She was member of the House of Representatives for the Pacifist Socialist Party and GreenLeft.
Biography.
Van Es became assistant to the PSP parliamentary party in 1975. During the 1981 election she was elected to parliament. From 1985 she was chair of the parliamentary party, which after the 1986 election was represented only by her. In the 1989 election, the PSP combined forces with the Communist Party of the Netherlands and the progressive Christian Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People's Party under the name GreenLeft. In November 1990, just before GreenLeft was formed as a separate political party, Van Es left politics in order to "make room for new GreenLeft faces" and because she had difficulty combining motherhood and her place in parliament. She was a consciously single mother from 1988. She was replaced as an MP by party member Leoni Sipkes.
After her political career, Van Es worked for the broadcasters VPRO and NOS. In 1996 she married MP Maarten van Traa, with whom she had had a relationship since 1990. In October 1997, Van Traa died during a car crash. After her journalist work, Van Es led the political-cultural centre De Balie in Amsterdam and chaired the GGZ-Netherlands, a health organization, between 2002 and 2007. In 2001 she was asked by the cabinet to help Máxima Zorreguieta, then the future wife of Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange integrate in the Dutch society. Between 2002 and 2004 she was a member of the Dijkstal committee, which studied the salaries for politicians and high ranking civil servants. She worked from November 2007 as director-general of Government and Kingdom Relations, one of the highest-ranking civil servants within the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations.
Since April 2010 she has been a member of the executive of the city of Amsterdam responsible for, amongst others, work & income and diversity & integration.

Antonio Commisso

Antonio Commisso (born Siderno, Italy, January 16, 1956) is an Italian criminal and a member of the 'Ndrangheta, a criminal and mafia-type organisation in Calabria, Italy. He was a fugitive since 2005 and included in the list of most wanted fugitives in Italy until his capture on June 28, 2005, near Toronto, Canada. He is also known by his nickname "l’avvocatu" ("the lawyer").
Early life.
Commisso was born in Siderno into a traditional 'Ndrangheta family, the Commisso 'ndrina. Since the 1960s, Siderno was the fiefdom of Antonio Macrì, the undisputed boss at the time, who was connected with the Commisso clan. In January 1975, Macrì was killed in the so-called first 'Ndrangheta war. His right-hand man Francesco Commisso – who was wounded in the attack on Macrì – was intended to be his successor. However, Commisso appointed his son, Cosimo, also known as "the quail" ("'u quagghia"), as the new boss of the locale of Siderno. 
In the 1980s, the Commisso were challenged by the Costa 'Ndrina over the command of Siderno, the latter having returned from Toronto. By 1991, the feud – that had spilled over to Toronto as well – ended in a victory for the Commisso clan. Officially, there were 28 dead among the Costas and eight among the Commissos. Cosimo Commisso was sentenced over the vendetta and his nephew Antonio Commisso succeeded him as the acting boss of the clan.
Fugitive.
Antonio Commisso was first arrested in 1999. While awaiting appeal, he regularly had to report to police, was subject to a strict night-time curfew, and was prohibited from leaving town.
On April 15, 2004, Commisso was definitively convicted and sentenced to 10 years and seven months for Mafia association and trafficking in weapons. When police arrived at his home to arrest him, he was nowhere to be found. On May 14, 2004, he presented himself to the Canadian immigration officials at Montreal's Trudeau International airport. The Canadian authorities here had no choice but to admit him because he had been granted permanent residency status in Canada in 1974, when he was 18.
Arrest and extradition.
After living as a fugitive in Canada for more than a year, Commisso was arrested at his residence in Woodbridge, Ontario, on an extradition warrant issued in Canada at the request of the Italian government. The federal government was already taking steps to have Commisso permanently deported from the country.
The Commisso clan was involved in international drug trafficking using family ties in Italy, Canada, the United States and Australia.

William Wang

William Wang is a Taiwanese-born American entrepreneur. He is the founder and CEO of Vizio.
Early life.
Wang was born and raised in Taiwan, moved to Hawaii, United States at the age of 13 and then to California at the age of 14. He attended the University of Southern California and graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 1986.
Vizio.
In 2000, Wang survived the crash of Singapore Airlines Flight 006, suffering only carbon monoxide poisoning. The event proved inspirational: in his potentially final moments, Wang thought first of his family and second of all the business-related headaches that were suddenly gone. The tragedy provided an opportunity for Wang to reorganize his thoughts and his life. Within two years, Wang had closed down all of his businesses before entering the television market.
In 2001, Gateway asked Wang to help put together a TV plan. Ted Waitt then chairman had been one of Wang’s customers at MAG, his former company and had become a mentor to Wang. Wang’s team helped Gateway put together its 42-inch plasma TV system, priced at $2999. Comparable systems at the time sold for upwards of $6000. Not long after that, Wang decided to get into the TV business for himself.
He started "V Inc." in 2002 with Laynie Newsome, Ken Lowe and $600,000. His idea was to combine low prices with high quality and exceptional customer support, and to make this approach profitable through extremely lean operations. He had originally wanted to name it W Inc. after being impressed with the Hotel W during a stay there, but settled for V when he learned that W had already been copyrighted. Later when V Inc. was found to be hard to pronounce, he renamed the company VIZIO Inc. – the name used for their plasma TV. The company is now one of the largest sellers of LCD HDTVs in North America with $2.5 billion in revenue in 2009 and a three-year growth rate of 295.12%.

Fun (band)

Fun (stylized as Fun.) is an American indie pop band based in New York City. It was formed by Nate Ruess, formerly the lead singer of The Format. After the breakup of The Format, Ruess formed Fun with Andrew Dost and Jack Antonoff, of Anathallo and Steel Train, respectively. Fun has released two albums: "Aim and Ignite" in August 2009 and "Some Nights" in February 2012. 
The band is best known for three hit singles: Grammy Award-winning "We Are Young" (featuring Janelle Monáe), "Some Nights", and "Carry On". "We Are Young" reached number one on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 and Digital Songs charts. It also peaked at number one in the United Kingdom. "Some Nights" was released as the album's second single in June 2012, peaking at number three on the Hot 100 chart and becoming Fun's second Top 10 single, as well as the band's second song to reach platinum status in the United States.
On February 10, 2013, Fun won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist and won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for "We Are Young". Additionally, Fun was a nominee for four other Grammy Awards: Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo or Group Performance (both for "We Are Young") along with Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album (both for "Some Nights").
Background.
2008: Career beginning and formation.
The Format split in February 2008. Immediately afterward, Nate Ruess asked Andrew Dost and Jack Antonoff to join his new project. Dost had toured with The Format and provided various instrumentation. Ruess met Antonoff after The Format toured with Steel Train. The three began working together in New Jersey within a week. Ruess sang melodies while the other two provided music for them. The first demo song the band recorded was "Benson Hedges", which was made available free in "Spin"'s August 20, 2008 article on the band. Fun approached Steven McDonald, who produced The Format's album "Dog Problems" with Ruess, to produce their debut album. McDonald was enthusiastic about the project and stated, "I can’t believe what we’re working on here. This crushes anything I’ve ever done."
2009–2010: "Aim and Ignite".
Recording took place in the fall of 2008. The band's first single, "At Least I'm Not as Sad As I Used to Be" was made available as a free download on the band's Myspace page on April 6, 2009. "Aim and Ignite" was released on August 25, 2009 and received positive reviews. AbsolutePunk.net's Drew Beringer praised the album, stating it was "what a pop album 'should' sound like" and "the most essential pop album of 2009." Allmusic called the album "progressive, but in the best possible way" and admired Ruess's lyrics for "investigating the larger truths of life...with a witty approach that keeps the songs bubbling merrily along on a positive note". Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic wrote, ""Aim and Ignite" isn’t the most consistent pop album around," but he ultimately commended the album as "a superbly mixed and arranged album made by musicians who clearly understand the limits and potential of pop music". Estella Hung of PopMatters was less impressed with the album. She praised songs "Be Calm" and "The Gambler", but criticized the lyrics and production of the album's early tracks. Hung concluded that while "Aim and Ignite" is "pretty original to say the least", it "fails to live up to the Format’s last outing." Popdose's Ken Shane called the album "an interesting and unusual listen." Shane applauded the album's songwriting and said "many of the songs are really good," but he objected to the "cute" production, desiring to hear the band "in a more stripped-down form." He ended his review with: "I have a similar problem with Dr. Dog, a band that was recommended to me by a number of people. I think much of their recorded work is too fussed over, but when I saw them live and their sound was more stripped down out of necessity, emphasizing their powerful songwriting, I thought they were wonderful. Perhaps the same fate awaits me with Fun." In reviewing the album, "The Washington Post" called some of the arrangements "theatrical, much like those on Panic at the Disco's 2005 debut". The album reached number 26 on Sputnikmusic's top 50 albums of 2009. The album peaked at 71 on the US album charts.
Fun began its first North American tour on November 8, 2008 opening for Jack's Mannequin, as well as opening for them again in February 2010, followed by their first UK appearances in March. In April 2010, Fun supported Paramore's headline tour. The band then embarked on a full UK tour in May. On August 4, 2010, Fun announced that they had signed with label Fueled by Ramen.
In 2010 Fun's single, "Walking the Dog", was used in a commercial for the travel site Expedia.com. Will Noon (formerly of Straylight Run) played drums with Fun on tour, according to Noon's Twitter page. To celebrate the Paramore UK tour and the band’s new single "Walking the Dog", Hassle Records gave away a free download of an acoustic version of the track.
2011–present: "Some Nights".
On May 17, 2011, the band released "C'mon" as a joint single with Panic! at the Disco, for whom they opened on their 2011 Vices & Virtues Tour. On November 7, 2011, the band announced that their next album would be titled "Some Nights". Its first single, called "We Are Young" featuring Janelle Monáe, has since been used in several other media including television series "Gossip Girl", "90210", "Glee", and "Chuck", commercials for Chevrolet and Apple, and in the trailer for Judd Apatow's film "This Is 40".
On December 12, 2011, the band's song "One Foot" was available for instant streaming and free download on "Nylon"'s website. On February 13, 2012, the band released an album stream of Some Nights on their website along with a note from Ruess thanking fans for their ongoing support. Ruess states he is "over the moon about what you're about to hear and falling asleep knowing that as soon as I wake up, this will no longer be a dream." (It was released on February 21, 2012 through Fueled by Ramen). On February 17, 2012, Fun played to a room full of Music Industry executives, Radio Programmers and Music Supervisors at Sunset Sessions, held at the Rancho Bernardo inn, San Diego. On February 29, 2012 the band kicked off the start of their North American tour in support of Some Nights.
On March 7, 2012, Fun's single "We Are Young" reached the No. 1 spot on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. This makes Fun the first multi-member rock band to have a No. 1 "Billboard" debut on the Hot 100 since Nickelback's "How You Remind Me" in December 2001/January 2002. On April 11, 2012, Billboard.com announced that Fun's "We Are Young" also made Digital Sales history. As the song was at the No. 1 spot on the "Billboard" Hot 100 for a sixth consecutive week, it has become the first, and at this time only, song that has ever gained 300,000+ downloads for seven weeks straight. The group performed "We Are Young" on the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 11, 2012.
The song "We Are Young" made an early appearance during the 2011 Pacific-12 Football Championship Game. The chorus played underneath a montage of highlights featuring University of Oregon players.
Jimmy Fallon recalled the band performing on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon" on June 22, 2012: "They did "Some Nights" and just hit a homer, it was incredible. People who didn't even really know them were like, 'Oh, that's those "We Are Young" guys? I love them!"
On October 24, 2012, the music video for the album's third single, "Carry On", was released. "Carry On" is the third song from "Some Nights" to enter the "Billboard" Hot 100.
On November 3, 2012 Fun performed the songs "Some Nights" and "Carry On" on "Saturday Night Live".
The group performed at the 55th Grammy Awards, held February 10, 2013. "Entertainment Weekly" predicted that "We Are Young" would bring home the Grammy in the categories "Record of the Year" and "Song of the Year" (writing, of the latter, "'We Are Young' is the kind of anthem this category is made for"), and that "Some Nights" would win for "Best Pop Vocal Album." "We Are Young" won the Grammy for the "Song of the Year" category. Fun also won the Grammy for "Best New Artist". They were nominated for "Record of the Year". Nate Ruess, after winning for "We Are Young", jokingly said, "I don't know what I was thinking, writing the chorus for this song. If this is in HD, everybody can see our faces, and we are not very young."
On February 26, 2013 Fun released the music video for "Why Am I the One", the fourth single from the album.
On December 17, 2013 Fun digitally released , a live EP with songs from both Aim and Ignite and Some Nights, as well as a recording of "What the Fuck", previously unreleased by the band. A vinyl release of the EP has been announced for 2014.

1998–99 Australian region cyclone season

The 1998–99 Australian region cyclone season was an event in the ongoing cycle of tropical cyclone formation. It began on 1 November 1998 and ended on 30 April 1999. The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a "tropical cyclone year" separately from a "tropical cyclone season", which runs from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
Tropical cyclones in this area are monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs): the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane; and TCWC Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.
__TOC__
Storms.
Tropical Cyclone Zelia.
This storm developed near Cocos Island.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Alison.
A tropical depression formed on 6 November 1998 near Cocos Island. The tropical depression rapidly strengthened into Tropical Cyclone Alison on the same day. Alison was 130 miles northeast of Cocos Island and was moving southeast.Alison passed only 25 miles south of Cocos bringing gale force winds to the island. On 11 November, Alison encountered wind shear which weakened the storm and by 13 November the storm dissipated.[http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/1999/summ9811.htm#9904tle
Severe Tropical Cyclone Billy.
Billy formed on 1 December 1998 off the northwestern Australia coast. The storm moved nearly due south before making landfall near Onslow, Western Australia.[http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/1999/summ9812.htm#9905] Damage estimates from Australia are unavailable.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Thelma.
On 3 December a tropical depression formed in the Arafura Sea, 250 miles east-northeast of Darwin. The system drifted southwestward, strengthening into Tropical Cyclone Thelma on 6 December. Thelma continued to intensify as it turned to the south-southwest, reaching Category 5 strengthen on the Australian cyclone scale as it brushed the Tiwi Islands.[http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/1999/summ9812.htm#9905] Cyclone Thelma reached a peak of 140 mph with a minimum pressure of 925 mbar on the 8th, and made landfall on the western Australian coastline on the 10th. After making landfall, the storm paralleled the coastline, and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm. Favorable conditions aloft allowed it to remain a tropical storm until the 15th, when the storm dissipated near Port Hedland. Thelma was responsible for moderate rainfall and downed trees, but caused no casualties due to the sparse population of where it hit.
Tropical Low.
On 3 December, an area of concentrated convection developed from a monsoon trough over the Indian Ocean. The next day RSMC La Reunion issued one advisory on this system, labeling it "A3". Over the next few days the area drifted eastward into the Australian region and slowly organized. The warning center at Perth initiated bulletins on the tropical low on 7 December when the system was located 175 nm west-northwest of Cocos Island. The low remained essentially stationary for the next 48 hours while slowly weakening. Perth discontinued bulletins on the 8th, but continued to track the low for the next few days. The remnants of the low drifted eastward to a point about 150 nm north-northwest of Cocos. There is a significant possibility that this low is the same persistent one that developed into Tropical Cyclone Cathy.
Tropical Cyclone Cathy.
This storm developed near Cocos Island.
Tropical Low.
A tropical disturbance was first noted by JTWC over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 25 December. The system deepened as it moved slowly westward over the next two days. The disturbance continued to intensify over the Northern Territory, until it stalled over the border of Queensland for a couple of days. On 30 December the system moved over water and began to develop further, prompting TCWC Brisbane to issue a Tropical Cyclone Watch for portions of the southern Gulf coast. The low turned south-southeast shortly afterwards, and warnings were canceled when it became apparent that the center moved back inland. The system weakened over northwestern Queensland and dissipated on 2 January.
The low brought heavy rains to the state of Queensland, with many centers reporting 24-hour totals over 150 mm. This rainfall activity was enhanced by an upper-level trough which brought showers as far south as Sydney on 1 January. Widespread flooding caused some of river systems which feed into Lake Eyre to reach flood stage. At least one death was indirectly attributed to the storm, when heavy rain and fog caused a car to drive off a road north of Brisbane.
Tropical Cyclone Olinda.
Tropical Cyclone Olinda existed from 20 January to 21 January.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Damien-Birenda.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Damien-Birenda existed from 21 January to 28 January.
Tropical Cyclone Pete.
Tropical Cyclone Pete existed from 21 January to 28 January.
Tropical Low (16P).
An elongated monsoon trough spread across northern Australia in late January. On 22 January the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began mentioning a disturbance in the Gulf of Carpentaria in their daily Tropical Weather Outlooks. The disturbance drifted eastward from the north of Arnhem Land into the northern Gulf. The TCWC at Darwin begin issuing warnings on 24 January and a cyclone watch was posted for portions of the southern Gulf Coast. JTWC issued a Formation Alert early that day and began issuing warnings on the 25th.
The system drifted slowly in a south-southwesterly direction over the next couple of days. According to JTWC estimates, the system strengthened into a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on 25 January. Conditions deteriorated on 26 January when the system ran into some vertical wind shear and weakened. The JTWC noted that a second circulation appeared to the east of the warning position and that dry air entrainment had led to decreased organization of the depressions. When the low was about 125 nm east of Alyangula, Darwin issued the last gale warning, and ceased advices on the slow-moving system 24 hours later.
Tropical Low (18S).
A tropical low numbered 18S existed from 31 January to 14 February.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Rona.
Rona formed in the Coral Sea and crossed the Queensland coast on 11 February causing major flooding between Cairns and Townsville with extensive crop damage. [http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/eiab/reports/ar98-99/appendix7.pdf] It eventually reformed into Severe Tropical Cyclone Frank in the South Pacific.
Tropical Low (26S).
A tropical low numbered 26S existed from 7 March to 14 March.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Vance.
A tropical depression formed in the Timor Sea on 16 March 1999. The storm lingered before being upgraded to cyclone status and was named Vance. By 19 March, Cyclone Vance had reached Category 3 status as it neared the Australian coast. On 20 March, Vance became a Category 5 Australian cyclone as it made landfall near Exmouth. Moving southward, the interaction with land weakened Vance and by 24 March, the storm dissipated before reaching Victoria, Australia.
Vance caused significant flooding and property damage but there were no deaths.[http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/seasonsummary199899.shtml]
Severe Tropical Cyclone Vance devastated the northwest town of Exmouth. A measured wind gust of 267 km/h, recorded at 11.50 am (WST) 22 March, at Learmonth Meteorological Office, is the highest wind speed ever recorded on mainland Australia. The Bureau’s Regional Director Len Broadbridge said that Vance was one of the most severe cyclones in Australia’s history. "The wind speeds experienced at Exmouth are possibly the strongest experienced by an Australian town or city in recorded history." [http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/media_releases/wa/waro_19990323.shtml]
Severe Tropical Cyclone Elaine.
Making landfall on 20 March, this cyclone devastated the small town of Moora, where houses and commercial properties in the town were inundated by the floodwaters and approximately 1000 people were evacuated.[http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/seasonsummary199899.shtml]
Tropical Low.
Another tropical low existed from 20 March to 21 March.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Frederic-Evrina.
This cyclone moved into Reunion area of responsibility on 1 April.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda.
Cyclone Gwenda was another category 5 cyclone, the strongest of the season and the most powerful cyclone in this region on record. It formed on 4 April, and fortunately weakened before making landfall near Port Hedland, Australia on 7 April. Damage was minimal. [http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/seasonsummary199899.shtml]
Tropical Low.
Another tropical low existed from 16 April to 19 April.
Tropical Cyclone Hamish.
This cyclone moved into Reunion area of responsibility on 21 April at tropical cyclone intensity. However, it was designated F1 and not named.
Storm names.
Tropical cyclones are assigned names by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology or Papua New Guinea. Tropical cyclones are named if they are non-frontal low pressure systems of synoptic scale developing over warm waters, or if Dvorak intensity analysis indicate the presence of gale force or stronger winds near the centre. Therefore, tropical systems with gales in one or more quadrants, but not near the centre, are not named. All names assigned in the Australian region are selected sequentially. Only the names used during this cyclone season are listed below. The complete list of names for each basin are found in the World Meteorological Organization's official lists.
Each Australian Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane) maintains a list of names arranged alphabetically and alternating male and female. Tropical cyclones that develop in the South-East Indian Ocean are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Perth. This region includes the areas east of 90°E, south of the Equator, and west of 125°E. Tropical cyclones that develop south of the Equator between 125°E and 141°E are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Darwin, Northern Territory. This area includes most of the cyclones that form in the Arafura Sea and Western Gulf of Carpentaria. Tropical cyclones in the Coral Sea and Eastern Gulf of Carpentaria between 141°E and 160°E and south of 10°S are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane, Queensland.
Perth
Darwin
Brisbane
Additionally, the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea reserves the right to name cyclones that develop in the Solomon Sea and Gulf of Papua, north of 10°S between 141°E and 160°E. Names are selected randomly from their list and retired once they are used. No cyclones were named by this warning centre during the 1998-99 season.

Ab Harrewijn

Albert Bastiaan (Ab) Harrewijn (Giessen-Nieuwkerk, 22 November 1954 - Utrecht, 13 May 2002) was a Dutch GreenLeft politician. 
Harrewijn was a preacher who was a member of the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN). He was strongly committed to helping people in the lowest ranks of society: the homeless, social security claimants and addicts. He was active in the CPN at the municipal and provincial level. 
On 1 February 1995 Harrewijn became partijvoorzitter (chairman) of the GreenLeft Party, which had emerged after a merger of the CPN, the Christian left Evangelical People's Party and Political Party of Radicals and the left-socialist Pacifist Socialist Party in 1991. He remained in that position until the 1998 elections when he was elected to the House of Representatives of the Netherlands. Here he focused on defence and social affairs. This earned him the nickname "General Ab". As GreenLeft defence spokesperson, he was a member of the temporary committee on decision-making procedures for military operations.
Harrewijn stood again in the 2002 elections. However, a few days before the 15 May election date he suffered a massive stroke, which ended his life two days before the election (the stroke may have been induced by the stress of the 6 May 2002 announcement of the murder of Pim Fortuyn). The Leftwing Cheek, the GreenLeft platform for religion and politics, instituted an Ab Harrewijn Prize in his honour, for creative, small initiatives for people in the lowest ranks of society. The National Client Council organizes a yearly lecture in his honour. In 2006 the Harrewijn Law was adopted. This was based on an initiative of Harrewijn and fellow GreenLeft MP Paul Rosenmöller, which seeks to inform works councils of the salaries of the top levels of management and its Board of directors.

Trevor Anning

Trevor Sean Anning (born 22 March 1982) is an English cricketer who plays for Devon County Cricket Club. 
Although Anning has only played two List A matches for Devon, he has been a regular in the Minor Counties Championship and the Minor Counties Trophy. His highest batting score came in his Minor Counties Championship debut against Wiltshire County Cricket Club, scoring 75 whilst batting at number 9 in a partnership worth 129 with veteran Peter Roebuck. His best bowling performance was 7–86 against Hereford in July 2007.
Both of Anning's List A matches have come in the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. In September 2002 (playing in the preliminary rounds to the 2003 competition), Anning did not bat against fellow Minor County Cumberland, but he took three wickets in a comfortable win for Devon. Anning also played in the 2005 competition, against a very strong Essex side, containing no fewer than 7 full internationals. Anning finished with highly-respectable bowling figures of 6–0–20–0 as Essex posted a target of 264 from 50 overs. Devon were 23 for 6 before Neil Hancock and Sandy Allen added 24 before Allen was caught behind by James Foster. Anning then successfully defended his wicket for 33 balls, scoring just 5 runs in half an hour, before being caught by Ravi Bopara off the spin bowling of Zimbabwean international Grant Flower. He was the last man out as Devon lost by 180 runs.
He also played 13 Second Eleven Trophy games for the Minor Counties under 25s.
Anning is leading the Devon bowling averages for 2008 with 24 wickets at an average of 21.71.

The NIFL Reserve League is an intermediate Association football league in Northern Ireland consisting of the reserve teams of the twelve NIFL Premiership clubs.
History.
The NIFL Reserve League is the successor to the Irish League B Division Section 2 which was formed in 1977, when the B Division split into two sections: Section 1 for intermediate clubs and the other for the reserve teams of senior clubs. Since the foundation of the B Division in 1951, these two categories of teams had competed together. In 1999, Section 1 of the B Division was renamed the Irish League Second Division and Section 2 became the Irish League Reserve League. In 2003, on the formation of the Irish Premier League, the IFA took direct control and the league was renamed the IFA Reserve League. In 2013, the Northern Ireland Football League took over, and the league was again renamed, to the NIFL Reserve League.

Climate of Kosovo

Kosovo is a relatively small territory. Because of the climatic position and complicated structure of the relief, Kosovo has a variety of climate systems. Kosovo lies in the south part of the middle geographical latitude of the northern hemisphere and it is affected by the Mediterranean mild climate and European continental climate. Important factors that affect Kosovo's climate are: its position towards Eurasia and Africa, hydrographic masses (Atlantic ocean and Mediterranean sea), atmospheric masses (tropic, arctic and continental) etc. Minor factors that affect Kosovo's climate are: relief, hydrography, plain and vegetation.
Climatic areas.
The climatic area of the Ibar valley is influenced by continental air masses. For this reason, in this part of the region, the winters are colder with medium temperatures above , but sometimes down to . The summers are very hot with average temperatures of , sometimes up to . This area is characterized by a dry climate and a total annual precipitation of 600 mm per year, approximately. The climatic area of Metohija, which includes the watershed of the White Drin river, is influenced very much by the hot air masses, which cross the Adriatic Sea. Medium temperatures during winter range from to sometimes . The average annual precipitation of this climatic area is about per year. The winter is characterized by heavy snowfalls. The climatic area of the mountains and forest parts is characterised by a typical forest clime, that is associated with heavy rainfalls ( per year), and summers that are very short and cold, and winters that are cold and with a lot of snow. Finally, it can be stated that the Kosovo territory is characterised by a sunny climate with variable temperature and humidity conditions.
Territorial and temporal climatic elements.
General air flows, physical, geographical and topographical characteristics enforce territorial and temporal changes of climatic elements.
Air temperature.
Air temperature is the main climatic element which tells the degree of air heat near-earth layers. In Kosovo there are thermal differences in horizontal and vertical direction. The eastern side is colder than the western part.
The average temperature of Kosovo for a year is . The warmest month is July with , the coldest is January with . The highest average temperature for a year is in Prizren (), the lowest temperature in Podujevo (). Except Prizren and Istok, all other meteorological stations, in January have average temperatures under .
Except average temperature values, thermal characteristics of Kosovo will be better understood in the analyze of extreme values. Maximal values in all meteorological stations are higher than , while the absolute lowest value was registered on June 6, 1963 in Gnjilane with a value of . Based on the summary, the amplitude of the average of the average values in Kosovo is and the extreme value is . Movements of air temperature from year to year are pretty much noticeable. In lower parts of Kosovo, tropic days usually last for 30 days.
Precipitation.
Precipitation is an important indicator of the climate in Kosovo and it represents a meteorological element with significant changes with time and territory. Key features of the rainfall of each territory are: the submission forms, their distribution during the year, annual amount, pluviometric regime, the number of days with precipitation and their intensity.
You can see all precipitation forms in Kosovo. Important significance has the rainfall in hills and valleys, and heavy snowfall in the high mountain areas such as Prokletije and Šar Mountains. The presence of hail is an unfortunate phenomenon for the agriculture in Kosovo. This form of precipitation mostly occurs during July and August.
Even though Kosovo lies in a relatively small territory, there are noticeable differences between territories and their amount of precipitation. Kosovo is affected by middle-maritime and middle-continental precipitation regime. On the west, the middle-maritime form is more present. This type of precipitation regime is known for big rainfalls during the year (over ), the maximum amount during November and the minimum during summer. The eastern part is affected by the middle-continental type of precipitation, which is known with lack of rainfall during a year (over ), the maximum amount during May and the minimum during winter. The biggest amount of rainfall is in the west part of Prokletije with over , while the lowest amount of rainfall can be found in the east part – Kosovska Kamenica with less than . Snowfall is a common occurrence during the cold months of the year. In the low parts of Kosovo there are averagely 26 days with snowfall, while the high parts have over 100 days. The number of days with snow and the thickness depend on the relief. Snowfall has an importance on keeping the wetness of the surface, creating water reserves, tourism etc.
Winds.
Winds are a random meteorological phenomenon in Kosovo. The dominant wind direction usually has the bigger force and speed. The average wind speed in Kosovo is 1.3 m/s in Peć to 2.4 m/s Uroševac. Extreme wind speeds in Kosovo are around 31 m/s which occur during March and April; usually end up with causing damage on houses.
Insolation (solar irradiation).
Insolation is a measure of solar radiation energy received on a given surface area and recorded during a given time. Insolation is a climatic element that has an importance in different economical activities such as: agriculture, tourism etc.
The period of insolation depends on astronomical, meteorological and relief factors. Insolation is smaller in narrow valleys, river valleys and mountain ranges as a result of the increase of overcast and elevation.
Kosovo has on average 2,066 hours with sun per year or approximately 5.7 hours per day. The highest insolation value is in Pristina with 2.140 hours for 1 year, while Peć with the smallest insolation value of 1.958 hours, Uroševac with 2.067 hours and Prizren with 2.099 hours. The maximum insolation in Kosovo occurs during July, while the lowest insolation occurs in December.
Climatic territorial differences in Kosovo.
The climatic changes based on territories depend on various factors, such as: vegetation, humidity of the territory etc. Climate classifications are usually based on: wind exposure, mountain height and direction, climatic effects on vegetation and watercourses.
From all the climatic classifications made in Kosovo, the most accurate one is the one provided by W. Köppen. According to this classification, Kosovo is part of C and D types of climate. Kosovo’s hot average climate during summer months is under and the cold average is above . According to the thermal characteristics, amount of rainfall and their regime in low parts of Kosovo, we get two subtypes of climate:
The climatic subtype of the western part has soft winters and a big amount of rainfall. These characteristics are inherited by the Mediterranean mild climate. The climatic subtype of "Kosovo" has cold winters and lack of rainfall, characteristics inherited from the continental type of climate. Even though Kosovo has these climatic characteristics most of the time, there might be a major change in climate on certain years only. In 1992, Kosovo had a very hot and dry summer, which fits the B climatic type of Köppen. D-climatic type which is known for average temperatures of during cold months and during hot months can be found in high parts of Kosovo, such as Prokletije, the Šar Mountains and Kopaonik. This type of climate is known by the name "subalpine" and "alpine".
Human effect in Kosovo's climate.
Climate is important in human life, as well as vital activist such as: agriculture, rest, recreation, tourism, transport, medicine, sanitary-hygienic conditions.

History of Georgia (country)

The nation of Georgia ( "sakartvelo") was first unified as a kingdom under the Bagrationi dynasty by the King Bagrat III of Georgia in the 9th to 10th century, arising from a number of predecessor states of ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia. The kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries under King David IV the Builder and Queen Tamar the Great, and fell to the Mongol invasion by 1243, and after a brief reunion under George V the Brilliant to the Timurid Empire. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into a number of petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the Early Modern period struggled to maintain their autonomy against Safavid and Ottoman domination until Georgia was finally annexed by the Russian Empire in 1801. After a brief bid for independence with the Democratic Republic of Georgia of 1918–1921, Georgia was part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic from 1922 to 1936, and then formed the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic until the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991. The first president Zviad Gamsakhurdia stoked Georgian nationalism and vowed to assert Tbilisi's authority over Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Gamsakhurdia was deposed in a bloody coup d'état within the year and the country became embroiled in a bitter civil war, which lasted until 1995. Supported by Russia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia achieved "de facto" independence from Georgia. The Rose Revolution forced Eduard Shevardnadze to resign in 2003. The new government under Mikheil Saakashvili prevented the secession of a third breakaway republic in the Adjara crisis of 2004, but the conflict with Abkhazia and South Ossetia led to the 2008 Russo–Georgian War and tensions with Russia remain unresolved.
History of Georgia is inextricably linked with the history of the Georgian people.
Prehistoric period.
Evidence for the earliest occupation of the territory of present day Georgia goes back to c. 1.8 million years ago, as evident from the excavations of Dmanisi in the south-eastern part of the country. This is the oldest evidence of humans anywhere in the world outside Africa. Later prehistoric remains (Acheulian, Mousterian and the Upper Palaeolithic) are known from numerous cave and open-air sites in Georgia. The earliest agricultural Neolithic occupation is dated sometime between 6000 and 5000 BC. known as the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, where people used local obsidian for tools, raised animals such as cattle and pigs, and grew crops, including grapes.
Numerous excavations in tell settlements of the "Sulaveri-Somutepe-Group" have been conducted since the 1960s.
In the 1970s, archaeological excavations revealed a number of ancient settlements that included houses with galleries, carbon-dated to the 5th millennium BC in the Imiris-gora region of Eastern Georgia. These dwellings were circular or oval in plan, a characteristic feature being the central pier and chimney. These features were used and further developed in building Georgian dwellings and houses of the 'Darbazi' type. In the Chalcolithic period of the fourth and third millennia BC, Georgia and Asia Minor were home to the Kura-Araxes culture, giving way in the second millennium BC. to the Trialeti culture. Archaeological excavations have brought to light the remains of settlements at Beshtasheni and Ozni (4th–3rd millennium BC), and barrow burials (carbon dated to the 2nd millennium BC) in the province of Trialeti, at Tsalka (Eastern Georgia). Together, they testify to an advanced and well-developed culture of building and architecture.
Diauehi, a tribal union of early-Georgians, first appear in written history in the 12th century BC. Archaeological finds and references in ancient sources reveal elements of early political and state formations characterized by advanced metallurgy and goldsmith techniques that date back to the 7th century BC and beyond. Between 2100 and 750 BC, the area survived the invasions by the Hittites, Urartians, Medes, Proto-Persians and Cimmerians. At the same period, the ethnic unity of Proto-Kartvelians broke up into several branches, among them Svans, Zans/Chans and East-Kartvelians. That finally led to the formation of modern Kartvelian languages: Georgian (originating from East Kartvelian vernaculars), Svan, Megrelian and Laz (the latter two originating from Zan dialects). By that time Svans were dominant in modern Svaneti and Abkhazia, Zans inhabited modern Georgian province of Samegrelo, while East-Kartvelians formed the majority in modern eastern Georgia. As a result of cultural and geographic delimitation, two core areas of future Georgian culture and statehood formed in western and eastern Georgia by the end of the 8th century BC. The first two Georgian states emerged in the west known as the Kingdom of Colchis and in the east as the Kingdom of Iberia.
Antiquity.
Early Georgian kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia.
A second Georgian tribal union emerged in the 13th century BC on the Black Sea coast under the Kingdom of Colchis in western Georgia. The kingdom of Colchis, which existed from the 6th to the 1st centuries BCE is regarded as the first early Georgian state formation and the term "Colchians" was used as the collective term for early Georgian-Kartvelian tribes such as Mingrelians, Lazs and Chans who populated the eastern coast of the black sea.
According to the scholar of the Caucasian studies Cyril Toumanoff:
The ancient Greeks knew of Colchis, and it featured in the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts, who travelled there in search of the Golden Fleece. Starting around 2000 BC, northwestern Colchis was inhabited by the Svan and Zan peoples of the Kartvelian tribes. Another important ethnic element of ancient Colchis were Greeks who between 1000 and 550 BC established many trading colonies in the coastal area, among them Naessus, Pitiys, Dioscurias, Guenos, Phasis (modern Poti), Apsaros, and Rhizos (modern Rize in Turkey). In the eastern part of Georgia there was a struggle for the leadership among the various Georgian confederations during the 6th–4th centuries BC, which was finally won by the Kartlian tribes from the region of Mtskheta. According to the Georgian tradition, the Kingdom of Kartli (known as Iberia in the Greek-Roman literature) was founded around 300 BC by Parnavaz I, the first ruler of the Parnavazid dynasty.
Between 653 and 333 BC, both Colchis and Iberia survived successive invasions by the Median Empire, and later the Persian Empire. At the end of the 3rd century BC southern Iberia witnessed the invading armies of Alexander the Great, who established a vast Greco-Macedonian empire to the south of the Caucasus. Neither Iberia nor Colchis was incorporated into the empire of Alexander or any of the successor Hellenistic states of the Middle East. However, the culture of ancient Greece still had a considerable influence on the region, and Greek was widely spoken in the cities of Colchis. In Iberia Greek influence was less noticeable and Aramaic was widely spoken.
Between the early 2nd century BC and the late 2nd century AD both Colchis and Iberia, together with the neighboring countries, became an arena of long and devastating conflicts between major and local powers such as Rome, Armenia and the short-lived Kingdom of Pontus. In 189 BC, the rapidly growing Kingdom of Armenia took over more than half of Iberia, conquering the southern and southeastern provinces of Gogarene, Taokhia and Genyokhia, as well as some other territories. Between 120 and 63 BC, Armenia's ally Mithridate VI Eupator of Pontus conquered all of Colchis and incorporated it into his kingdom, embracing almost all of Asia Minor as well as the eastern and northern Black Sea coastal areas.
The Roman conquest of Iberia and Colchis.
This close association with Armenia brought upon the country an invasion (65 BC) by the Roman general Pompey, who was then at war with Mithradates VI of Pontus, and Armenia; but Rome did not establish her power permanently over Iberia. Nineteen years later, the Romans again marched (36 BC) on Iberia forcing King Pharnavaz II to join their campaign against Caucasian Albania.
During this time Armenia and Pontus were actively expanding at the expense of Rome, taking over its Eastern Mediterranean possessions. However, the success of the anti-Roman alliance did not last long. As a result of the brilliant Roman campaigns of Pompey and Lucullus from the west, and the Parthian invasion from the south, Armenia lost a significant part of its conquests by 65 BC, devolving into a Roman-Parthian dependency. At the same time, the Kingdom of Pontus was completely destroyed by the Romans and all its territory including Colchis were incorporated into the Roman Empire as her provinces.
The former Kingdom of Colchis became the Roman province of Lazicum ruled by Roman legati. The following 600 years of Georgian history were marked by struggle between Rome and Persia (Iran) including Parthians and Sassanids who were fighting long wars against each other for the domination in the Middle East including Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Albania, and Iberia.
While the Georgian kingdom of Colchis was administered as a Roman province, Caucasian Iberia freely accepted the Roman Imperial protection. A stone inscription discovered at Mtskheta speaks of the 1st-century ruler Mihdrat I (AD 58–106) as "the friend of the Caesars" and the king "of the Roman-loving Iberians." Emperor Vespasian fortified the ancient Mtskheta site of Arzami for the Iberian kings in 75 AD.
In the 2nd century AD, Iberia strengthened her position in the area, especially during the reign of King Pharsman II who achieved full independence from Rome and reconquered some of the previously lost territories from declining Armenia. In the early 3rd century, Rome had to give up Albania and most of Armenia to Sassanid Persia. The province of Lazicum was given a degree of autonomy that by the end of the century developed into full independence with the formation of a new Kingdom of Lazica-Egrisi on the territories of smaller principalities of the Zans, Svans, Apsyls, and Sanyghs. This new Western Georgian state survived more than 250 years until 562 when it was absorbed by the Byzantine Empire.
In the 3rd century AD, the Lazi tribe came to dominate most of Colchis, establishing the kingdom of Lazica, locally known as Egrisi. Colchis was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the Eastern Roman/Byzantine and Sassanid empires, culminating in the Lazic War from 542 to 562.
Adoption of Christianity as State Religion.
Before adoption of Christianity, the cult of Mithras and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Iberia from the 1st centuries AD. The cult of Mithras, distinguished by its syncretic character and thus complementary to local cults, especially the cult of the Sun, gradually came to merge with ancient Georgian beliefs.
The eastern Georgian Kingdom of Iberia became one of the first states in the world to convert to Christianity in 327 AD, when the King of Iberia Mirian III established it as the official state religion. However, the date varies based on numerous accounts and historical documents, which indicate Iberia adopting Christianity as a state religion in AD 317, 319, 324, 330 etc. According to The Georgian Chronicles, St. Nino of Cappadocia converted Georgia to Christianity in AD 330 during the time of Constantine the Great. By the middle of the 4th century though, both Lazica (formerly the Kingdom of Colchis) and Iberia adopted Christianity as their official religion. This adoption of Christianity tied the kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, which exerted strong cultural influence over it. During the 4th and most of the 5th centuries, Iberia (known also as the Kingdom of Kartli) was under Persian control. The Kingdom was abolished and the country was ruled by the governors appointed by the Shahs. At the end of the 5th century though, Prince Vakhtang I Gorgasali orchestrated an anti-Persian uprising and restored Iberian statehood, proclaiming himself the King. After this, the armies of Vakhtang launched several campaigns against both Persia and the Byzantine Empire. However, his struggle for the independence and unity of the Georgian state did not have lasting success. After Vakhtang's death in 502, and the short reign of his son Dachi (502–514), Iberia was reincorporated into Persia as a province once again. However this time the Iberian nobility were granted the privilege of electing the governors, who in Georgian were called "erismtavari". By the late 7th century, the Byzantine-Persian rivalry for the Middle East had given way to Arab conquest of the region and subsequent invasions to ensure Arab hegemony in the Caucasus.
Medieval Georgia.
Unification of the Georgian State.
The first decades of the 9th century saw the rise of a new Georgian state in Tao-Klarjeti. Ashot Courapalate of the royal family of Bagrationi liberated from the Arabs the territories of former southern Iberia. These included the Principalities of Tao and Klarjeti, and the Earldoms of Shavsheti, Khikhata, Samtskhe, Trialeti, Javakheti and Ashotsi, which were formally a part of the Byzantine Empire, under the name of "Curopalatinate of Iberia". In practice, however, the region functioned as a fully independent country with its capital in Artanuji. The hereditary title of Curopalates was kept by the Bagrationi family, whose representatives ruled Tao-Klarjeti for almost a century. Curopalate David Bagrationi expanded his domain by annexing the city of Theodossiopolis (Karin, Karnukalaki) and the Armenian province of Basiani, and by imposing a protectorate over the Armenian provinces of Kharqi, Apakhuni, Mantsikert, and Khlat, formerly controlled by the Kaysite Arab Emirs.
The first united Georgian monarchy was formed at the end of the 10th century when Curopalate David invaded the Earldom of Kartli-Iberia. Three years later, after the death of his uncle Theodosius the Blind, King of Egrisi-Abkhazia, Bagrat III inherited the Abkhazian throne. In 1001 Bagrat added Tao-Klarjeti (Curopalatinate of Iberia) to his domain as a result of David's death. In 1008–1010, Bagrat annexed Kakheti and Ereti, thus becoming the first king of a united Georgia in both the east and west.
The second half of the 11th century was marked by the strategically significant invasion of the Seljuq Turks, who by the end of the 1040s had succeeded in building a vast nomadic empire including most of Central Asia and Persia. In 1071, the Seljuq army destroyed the united Byzantine-Armenian and Georgian forces in the Battle of Manzikert. By 1081, all of Armenia, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and most of Georgia had been conquered and devastated by the Seljuqs in the Great Turkish Invasion. In Georgia, only the mountainous areas of Abkhazia, Svaneti, Racha, and Khevi–Khevsureti remained out of Seljuq control and served as a relatively safe havens for numerous refugees. The rest of the country was dominated by the conquerors who destroyed the cities and fortresses, looted the villages, and massacred both the aristocracy and the farming population. In fact, by the end of the 1080s, Georgians were outnumbered in the region by the invaders.
King David IV the Builder and Georgian Reconquista.
The struggle against the Seljuq invaders in Georgia was led by the young King David IV of the Bagrationi royal family, who inherited the throne in 1089 at the age of 16 after the abdication of his father George II Bagrationi. Soon after coming to power, David created the regular army and peasant militia in order to be able to resist Seljuq colonization of his country. The First Crusade (1096–1099) and the Crusaders' offensive against the Seljuq Turks in Anatolia and Syria favored David's successful campaigns in Georgia. By the end of 1099 David had stopped paying tribute to the Seljuqs and had liberated most of the Georgian lands, with the exception of Tbilisi and Hereti. In 1103 he reorganized the Georgian Orthodox Church and closely linked it with the state by appointing as Catholicos (Archbishop) a Crown Chancellor (Mtsihnobart Ukhutsesi) of Georgia. In 1103–1105 the Georgian army took over Hereti and made successful raids into still Seljuq-controlled Shirvan. Between 1110 and 1118 David took Lori, Samshvilde, Rustavi and other fortresses of lower Kartli and Tashiri, thus turning Tbilisi into an isolated Seljuq enclave.
In 1118–1119, having considerable amounts of free, unsettled land as a result of the withdrawal of Turkish nomads, and desperately needing qualified manpower for the army, King David invited some 40,000 Kipchak warriors from North Caucasus to settle in Georgia with their families. In 1120 the ruler of Alania recognized himself as King David's vassal and afterwards sent thousands of Alans (allegedly modern day Ossetians) to cross the main Caucasus range into Georgia, where they settled in Kartli. The Georgian Royal army also welcomed mercenaries from Germany, Italy, and Scandinavia (all those westerners were defined in Georgia as "the Franks") as well as from Kievan Rus.
In 1121, the Seljuq Sultan Mahmud declared Jihad on Georgia and sent a strong army under one of his famous generals Ilghazi to fight the Georgians. Although significantly outnumbered by the Turks, the Georgians managed to defeat the invaders at the Battle of Didgori, and in 1122 they took over Tbilisi, making it Georgia's capital. Three years later the Georgians conquered Shirvan. As a result, the mostly Christian-populated Ghishi-Kabala area in western Shirvan (a relic of the once prosperous Albanian Kingdom) was annexed by Georgia while the rest of already Islamicized Shirvan became Georgia's client-state. In the same year a large portion of Armenia was liberated by David's troops and fell into Georgian hands as well. Thus in 1124 David also became the King of Armenians, incorporating Northern Armenia into the lands of the Georgian Crown. In 1125 King David died, leaving Georgia with the status of a strong regional power. In Georgia, King David is called Agmashenebeli (English: the builder).
David Agmashenebeli's successors (Kings Demeter I, David V and George III) continued the policy of Georgia's expansion by subordinating most of the mountain clans and tribes of North Caucasia and further securing Georgian positions in Shirvan. However, the most glorious sovereign of Georgia of that period was definitely Queen Tamar (David's great-granddaughter).
Queen Tamar the Great and the Golden Age 1184–1213.
The reign of Queen Tamar represented the peak of Georgia's might in the whole history of the nation. In 1194–1204, Tamar's armies crushed new Turkish invasions from the south-east and south and launched several successful campaigns into Turkish-controlled Southern Armenia. As a result, most of Southern Armenia, including the cities of Karin, Erzinjan, Khelat, Muş and Van, came under Georgian control. Although it was not included in the lands of the Georgian Crown, and was left under the nominal rule of local Turkish Emirs and Sultans, Southern Armenia became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Georgia.
The temporary fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 to the Crusaders left Georgia and Bulgarian Empire as the strongest Christian states in the whole East Mediterranean area. The same year Queen Tamar sent her troops to take over the former Byzantine Lazona and Paryadria with the cities of Atina, Riza, Trebizond, Kerasunt, Amysos, Cotyora, Heraclea and Sinopa. In 1205, the occupied territory was transformed into the Empire of Trebizond, which was dependent on Georgia. Tamar's relative Prince Alexios Komnenos was crowned as its Emperor. In 1210 Georgian armies invaded northern Persia (modern day Iranian Azerbaijan) and took the cities of Marand, Tabriz, Ardabil, Zanjan and Qazvin, placing part of the conquered territory under a Georgian protectorate. This was the maximum territorial extent of Georgia throughout her history. Queen Tamar was addressed as "The Queen of Abkhazians, Kartvels, Rans, Kakhs and Armenians, Shirvan-Shakhine and Shakh-in-Shakhine, The Sovereign of the East and West". Georgian historians often refer to her as "Queen Tamar the Great".
The period between the early 12th and the early 13th centuries, and especially the era of Tamar the Great, can truly be considered as the golden age of Georgia. Besides the political and military achievements, it was marked by the development of Georgian culture, including architecture, literature, philosophy and sciences.
Mongol invasion and decline of the Georgian Kingdom.
In the 1220s, the South Caucasus and Asia Minor faced the invasion of the Mongols. In spite of fierce resistance by Georgian-Armenian forces and their allies, the whole area including most of Georgia, all Armenian lands and Central Anatolia eventually fell to the Mongols.
In 1243, Queen Rusudan of Georgia signed a peace treaty with the Mongols in accordance with which Georgia lost her client-states, ceded western Shirvan, Nakhichevan and some other territories and agreed to pay tribute to the Mongols as well as to let them occupy and de facto rule more than half of the remaining territory. Although Mongol-occupied Tbilisi remained an official capital of the kingdom, the Queen refused to return there and stayed in Kutaisi until her death in 1245. In addition to all the above hardships, even the part of the kingdom that remained free of the Mongols started disintegrating: The Crown started losing control over the warlords of Samtskhe (southern provinces of Georgia) who established their own relations with the Mongols and by the year 1266 practically seceded from Georgia.
The period between 1259 and 1330 was marked by the struggle of the Georgians against the Mongol Ilkhanate for full independence. The first anti-Mongol uprising started in 1259 under the leadership of King David Narin who in fact waged his war for almost thirty years. The Anti-Mongol strife went on under the Kings Demeter II (1270–1289) and David VIII (1293–1311). Finally, it was King George the Brilliant (1314–1346) who managed to play on the decline of the Ilkhanate, stopped paying tribute to the Mongols, restored the pre-1220 state borders of Georgia, and returned the Empire of Trebizond into Georgia's sphere of influence.
In 1386–1403, the Kingdom of Georgia faced eight Turco-Mongolic invasions under the leadership of Tamerlane. Except in Abkhazia and Svaneti, the invasions devastated Georgia's economy, population, and urban centers.
Early modern period.
Ottoman and Persian domination.
In 15th century the whole area changed dramatically in all possible aspects: linguistic, cultural, political, etc. During that period the Kingdom of Georgia turned into an isolated, fractured Christian enclave, a relic of the faded East Roman epoch surrounded by Muslim, predominantly Turco-Iranian-Arabic world.
By the middle of the 15th century, most of Georgia's old neighbor-states disappeared from the map within less than a hundred years. The fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 sealed the Black Sea and cut the remnants of Christian states of the area from Europe and the rest of the Christian world. Georgia remained connected to the West through contact with the Genoese colonies of the Crimea.
As a result of these changes, the Georgian Kingdom suffered economic and political decline and in the 1460s the kingdom fractured into several kingdoms and principalities:
By the late 15th century the Ottoman Empire was encroaching on the Georgian states from the west and in 1501 a new Muslim power, Safavid Persia, arose to the east. For the next few centuries, Georgia would become a battleground between these two great rival powers and the Georgian states would struggle to maintain their independence. In 1555, the Ottomans and the Safavids signed the Peace of Amasya, defining spheres of influence in Georgia, assigning Imereti in the west to the Turks and Kartli-Kakheti in the east to the Persians. The treaty however, was not in force for long as the Ottomans gained the upper hand and launched campaigns threatening to end the Persian domination in the region. They were repelled soon enough but not without some permanent losses on the Safavid side. As the Georgian rulers were against both Ottoman and Safavid control of their Kingdoms, they were forced to maneuver their way through and attempting to bring these two powers into conflict. In the end, Georgian rulers were forced to submit to the one conqueror or the other, considering Geographic proximity, but never fully surrendering to either. After the Ottoman failure to gain permanent foothold in the eastern Caucasus, Iranians immediately sought to strengthen their position and finally subject the rebellious Kingdoms of the Eastern Georgia. The campaigns of the most powerful Safavid ruler, Shah Abbas, to bring eastern Georgia under his sway were particularly devastating. Tens of thousands of Georgians were killed or deported to Persia and the shah had the queen mother, Ketevan, tortured to death. By the 17th century, both eastern and western Georgia had sunk into poverty as the result of the constant warfare. The economy was so bad that barter replaced the use of money and the populations of the cities declined markedly. The French traveller Jean Chardin, who visited the region of Mingrelia in 1671, noted the wretchedness of the peasants, the arrogance of the nobles and the ignorance of the clergy. The rulers were split between acknowledging Ottoman or Persian overlordship (which often entailed nominal conversion to Islam) or making a bid for independence. The emergence of a third imperial power to the north, Christian Russia, made the latter an increasingly tempting choice.
The 18th century and Russian annexation.
In the early 18th century, Kartli saw a partial recovery under Vakhtang VI, who instituted a new law code and tried to improve the economy. His reign saw the establishment of the first Georgian-language printing press in 1709.
Erekle II, king of Kartli-Kakheti from 1762 to 1798, turned towards Russia for protection against Ottoman and Persian attacks. The Russian empress Catherine the Great was keen to have the Georgians as allies in her wars against the Turks, but sent only meagre forces to help them. In 1769–1772, a handful of Russian troops under General Totleben "battled" against Turkish invaders in Imereti and Kartli-Kakheti. The Russian troops retreated before a clash against the Turks. In 1783 Erekle signed the Treaty of Georgievsk with Russia, according to which Kartli-Kakheti was to receive Russian protection and to have no diplomatic communications with other nations without Russia's prior concent. But when another Russo-Turkish War broke out in 1787, Erekle maintained diplomatic contacts with Ottoman liege Suleiman pasha from Akhaltsikhe and signed a separate treaty with him. This treaty was ratified by the sultan in the summer of 1787. Therefore the Russians withdrew their troops from the region for use elsewhere, leaving Erekle's kingdom unprotected. In 1795, the Persian shah, Agha Mohammed Khan, invaded the country and burnt the capital, Tbilisi, to the ground.
In spite of failure to honour the terms of the Treaty of Georgievsk, Georgian rulers felt they had nobody else to turn to. After Erekle's death, a civil war broke out over the succession to the throne of Kartli-Kakheti and one of the rival candidates called on Russia to intervene and decide matters. On January 8, 1801, Tsar Paul I of Russia signed a decree on the incorporation of Georgia (Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti) within the Russian Empire, which was confirmed by Tsar Alexander I on September 12, 1801. The Georgian envoy in Saint Petersburg, Garsevan Chavchavadze, reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice-chancellor Alexander Kurakin. In May 1801 Russian General Carl Heinrich Knorring dethroned the Georgian heir to the throne David Batonishvili and deployed a government headed by General Ivan Petrovich Lasarev.
A part of the Georgian nobility did not accept the decree until April 1802 when General Knorring compassed the nobility in Tbilisi's Sioni Cathedral and forced them to take an oath on the imperial crown of Russia. Those who disagreed were arrested temporarily.
In the summer of 1805 Russian troops on the river Askerani and near Zagam defeated the Persian army, saving Tbilisi from its attack. In 1810, the kingdom of Imereti (Western Georgia) was annexed by the Russian Empire after the suppression of King Solomon II's resistance. From 1803 to 1878, as a result of numerous Russian wars against Turkey and Persia, several formerly Georgian territories were annexed to the Russian Empire. These areas (Batumi, Artvin, Akhaltsikhe, Poti, and Abkhazia) now represent the majority of the territory of the present state of Georgia. Georgia was reunified for the first time in centuries but had lost its independence.
Modern history.
Russian Empire.
The Russian and Georgian societies had much in common: the main religion was Orthodox Christianity and in both countries a land-owning aristocracy ruled over a population of serfs. The Russian authorities aimed to integrate Georgia into the rest of their empire, but at first Russian rule proved high-handed, arbitrary and insensitive to local law and customs, leading to a conspiracy by Georgian nobles in 1832 and a revolt by peasants and nobles in Guria in 1841. Things changed with the appointment of Mikhail Vorontsov as Viceroy of the Caucasus in 1845. Count Vorontsov's new policies successfully won over the Georgian nobility, who became increasingly eager to abandon Islamic influences that had been forced upon Georgia in the preceding centuries and pursued, after the example of Russian nobility, a long-sought process of Europeanisation. Life for Georgian serfs was very different, however, since the rural economy remained seriously depressed. Georgian serfs lived in dire poverty, subject to the frequent threat of starvation. Few of them lived in the towns, where what little trade and industry there was, was in the hands of Armenians, whose ancestors had migrated to Georgia in the Middle Ages.
Serfdom was abolished in Russian lands in 1861. The tsar also wanted to emancipate the serfs of Georgia, but without losing the loyalty of the nobility whose revenues depended on peasant labour. This called for delicate negotiations before serfdom was gradually phased out in the Georgian provinces from 1864 onwards.
Growth of the national movement.
The emancipation of the serfs pleased neither the serfs nor the nobles. The poverty of the serfs had not been alleviated while the nobles had lost some of their privileges. The nobles in particular also felt threatened by the growing power of the urban, Armenian middle class in Georgia, who prospered as capitalism came to the region. Georgian dissatisfaction with Tsarist autocracy and Armenian economic domination led to the development of a national liberation movement in the second half of the 19th century.
A large-scale peasant revolt occurred in 1905, which led to political reforms that eased the tensions for a period. During this time, the Marxist Social Democratic Party became the dominant political movement in Georgia, being elected to all the Georgian seats in the Russian State Duma established after 1905. Josef Vissarionovich Djugashvili (more famously known as Joseph Stalin), a Georgian Bolshevik, became a leader of the revolutionary (and anti-Menshevik) movement in Georgia. He went on to control the Soviet Union.
Many Georgians were upset by the loss of independence of the Georgian Orthodox Church. The Russian clergy took control of Georgian churches and monasteries, prohibiting use of the Georgian liturgy and desecrating medieval Georgian frescos on various churches all across Georgia.
Between the years of 1855 to 1907, the Georgian patriotic movement was launched under the leadership of Prince Ilia Chavchavadze, world-renowned poet, novelist and orator. Chavchavadze financed new Georgian schools and supported the Georgian national theatre. In 1877 he launched the newspaper "Iveria", which played an important part in reviving Georgian national consciousness. His struggle for national awakening was welcomed by the leading Georgian intellectuals of that time such as Giorgi Tsereteli, Ivane Machabeli, Akaki Tsereteli, Niko Nikoladze, Alexander Kazbegi and Iakob Gogebashvili.
The Georgian intelligentsia's support for Prince Chavchavadze and Georgian independence is shown in this declaration:
The last decades of the 19th century witnessed a Georgian literary revival in which writers emerged of a stature unequalled since the Golden Age of Rustaveli seven hundred years before. Ilia Chavchavadze himself excelled alike in lyric and ballad poetry, in the novel, the short story and the essay. Apart from Chavchavadze, the most universal literary genius of the age was Akaki Tsereteli, known as "the immortal nightingale of the Georgian people." Along with Niko Nikoladze and Iakob Gogebashvili, these literary figures contributed significantly to the national cultural revival and were therefore known as the founding fathers of modern Georgia.
Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918–1921).
The Russian Revolution of October 1917 plunged Russia into a bloody civil war during which several outlying Russian territories declared independence. Georgia was one of them, proclaiming the establishment of the independent Democratic Republic of Georgia (DRG) on May 26, 1918. The new country was ruled by the Menshevik faction of the Social Democratic Party, which established a multi-party system in sharp contrast with the "dictatorship of the proletariat" established by the Bolsheviks in Russia. It was recognised by Soviet Russia (Treaty of Moscow (1920)) and the major Western powers in 1921
Georgian-Armenian War (1918).
During the final stages of World War I, the Armenians and Georgians had been defending against the advance of the Ottoman Empire. In June 1918, in order to forestall an Ottoman advance on Tiflis, the Georgian troops had occupied the Lori Province, which at the time had a 75% Armenian majority. After the Armistice of Mudros and the withdrawal of the Ottomans, the Georgian forces remained. Georgian Menshevik parlementarian Irakli Tsereteli offered that the Armenians would be safer from the Turks as Georgian citizens. The Georgians offered a quadripartite conference including Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus in order to resolve the issue, which the Armenians rejected. In December 1918, the Georgians were confronting a rebellion chiefly in the village of Uzunlar in the Lori region. Within days, hostilities commenced between the two republics.
The Georgian-Armenian War was a border war fought in 1918 between the Democratic Republic of Georgia and the Democratic Republic of Armenia over the parts of then disputed provinces of Lori, Javakheti, which had been historically bicultural Armenian-Georgian territories, but were largely populated by Armenians in the 19th century.
Red Army invasion (1921).
In February 1921, the Red Army invaded Georgia and after a short war occupied the country. The Georgian government was forced to flee. Guerrilla resistance in 1921–1924 was followed by a large-scale patriotic uprising in August 1924. Colonel Kakutsa Cholokashvili was one of the most prominent guerrilla leaders in this phase.
Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (1921–1990).
During the Georgian Affair of 1922, Georgia was forcibly incorporated into the Transcaucasian SFSR comprising Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia (including Abkhazia and South Ossetia). The Soviet Government forced Georgia to cede several areas to Turkey (the province of Tao-Klarjeti and part of Batumi province), Azerbaijan (the province of Hereti/Saingilo), Armenia (the Lore region) and Russia (northeastern corner of Khevi, eastern Georgia). Soviet rule was harsh: about 50,000 people were executed and killed in 1921–1924, more than 150,000 were purged under Stalin and his secret police chief, the Georgian Lavrenty Beria in 1935–1938, 1942 and 1945–1951. In 1936, the TFSSR was dissolved and Georgia became the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.
Reaching the Caucasus oilfields was one of the main objectives of Adolf Hitler's invasion of the USSR in June 1941, but the armies of the Axis powers did not get as far as Georgia. The country contributed almost 700,000 fighters (350,000 were killed) to the Red Army, and was a vital source of textiles and munitions. However, a number of Georgians fought on the side of the German armed forces, forming the Georgian Legion.
During this period Stalin ordered the deportation of the Chechen, Ingush, Karachay and the Balkarian peoples from the Northern Caucasus; they were transported to Siberia and Central Asia for alleged collaboration with the Nazis. He abolished their respective autonomous republics. The Georgian SSR was briefly granted some of their territory until 1957.
Stalin's successful appeal for patriotic unity eclipsed Georgian nationalism during the war and diffused it in the years following. On March 9, 1956, about a hundred Georgian students were killed when they demonstrated against Nikita Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinization.
The decentralisation program introduced by Khrushchev in the mid-1950s was soon exploited by Georgian Communist Party officials to build their own regional power base. A thriving pseudo-capitalist shadow economy emerged alongside the official state-owned economy. While the official growth rate of the economy of the Georgia was among the lowest in the USSR, such indicators as savings level, rates of car and house ownership were the highest in the Union, making Georgia one of the most economically successful Soviet republics. Corruption was at a high level. Among all the union republics, Georgia had the highest number of residents with high or special secondary education.
Although corruption was hardly unknown in the Soviet Union, it became so widespread and blatant in Georgia that it came to be an embarrassment to the authorities in Moscow. Eduard Shevardnadze, the country's interior minister between 1964 and 1972, gained a reputation as a fighter of corruption and engineered the removal of Vasil Mzhavanadze, the corrupt First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Shevardnadze ascended to the post of First Secretary with the blessings of Moscow. He was an effective and able ruler of Georgia from 1972 to 1985, improving the official economy and dismissing hundreds of corrupt officials.
Soviet power and Georgian nationalism clashed in 1978 when Moscow ordered revision of the constitutional status of the Georgian language as Georgia's official state language. Bowing to pressure from mass street demonstrations on April 14, 1978, Moscow approved Shevardnadze's reinstatement of the constitutional guarantee the same year. April 14 was established as a Day of the Georgian Language.
Shevardnadze's appointment as Soviet Foreign Minister in 1985 brought his replacement in Georgia by Jumber Patiashvili, a conservative and generally ineffective Communist who coped poorly with the challenges of perestroika. Towards the end of the late 1980s, increasingly violent clashes occurred between the Communist authorities, the resurgent Georgian nationalist movement and nationalist movements in Georgia's minority-populated regions (notably South Ossetia). On April 9, 1989, Soviet troops were used to break up a peaceful demonstration at the government building in Tbilisi. Twenty Georgians were killed and hundreds wounded and poisoned. The event radicalised Georgian politics, prompting many—even some Georgian communists—to conclude that independence was preferable to continued Soviet rule.
Independent Georgia.
Gamsakhurdia presidency (1991-1992).
Opposition pressure on the communist government was manifested in popular demonstrations and strikes, which ultimately resulted in an open, multiparty and democratic parliamentary election being held on 28 October 1990 in which the Round Table/Free Georgia bloc captured 54 percent of the proportional vote to gain 155 seats out of the 250 up for election, while the communists gained 64 seats and 30 percent of the proportional vote. The leading dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia became the head of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia. On March 31, 1991, Gamsakhurdia wasted no time in organising a referendum on independence, which was approved by 98.9% of the votes. Formal independence from the Soviet Union was declared on April 9, 1991, although it took some time before it was widely recognised by outside powers such as the United States and European countries. Gamsakhurdia's government strongly opposed any vestiges of Russian dominance, such as the remaining Soviet military bases in the republic, and (after the dissolution of the Soviet Union) his government declined to join the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
Gamsakhurdia was elected president on May 26, 1991, with 86% of the vote. He was subsequently widely criticised for what was perceived to be an erratic and authoritarian style of government, with nationalists and reformists joining forces in an uneasy anti-Gamsakhurdia coalition. A tense situation was worsened by the large amount of ex-Soviet weaponry available to the quarreling parties and by the growing power of paramilitary groups. The situation came to a head on December 22, 1991, when armed opposition groups launched a violent military coup d'état, besieging Gamsakhurdia and his supporters in government buildings in central Tbilisi. Gamsakhurdia managed to evade his enemies and fled to the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya in January 1992.
Shevardnadze presidency (1992–2003).
The new government invited Eduard Shevardnadze to become the head of a State Council—in effect, president—in March 1992, putting a moderate face on the somewhat unsavoury regime that had been established following Gamsakhurdia's ouster. In August 1992, a separatist dispute in the Georgian autonomous republic of Abkhazia escalated when government forces and paramilitaries were sent into the area to quell separatist activities. The Abkhaz fought back with help from paramilitaries from Russia's North Caucasus regions and alleged covert support from Russian military stationed in a base in Gudauta, Abkhazia and in September 1993 the government forces suffered a catastrophic defeat, which led to them being driven out and the entire Georgian population of the region being expelled. Around 14,000 people died and another 300,000 were forced to flee.
Ethnic violence also flared in South Ossetia but was eventually quelled, although at the cost of several hundred casualties and 100,000 refugees fleeing into Russian North Ossetia. In south-western Georgia, the autonomous republic of Ajaria came under the control of Aslan Abashidze, who managed to rule his republic from 1991 to 2004 as a personal fiefdom in which the Tbilisi government had little influence.
On September 24, 1993, in the wake of the Abkhaz disaster, Zviad Gamsakhurdia returned from exile to organise an uprising against the government. His supporters were able to capitalise on the disarray of the government forces and quickly overran much of western Georgia. This alarmed Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and units of the Russian Army were sent into Georgia to assist the government. Gamsakhurdia's rebellion quickly collapsed and he died on December 31, 1993, apparently after being cornered by his enemies. In a highly controversial agreement, Shevardnadze's government agreed that it would join the CIS as part of the price for military and political support.
Shevardnadze narrowly survived a bomb attack in August 1995 that he blamed on his erstwhile paramilitary allies. He took the opportunity to imprison the paramilitary leader Jaba Ioseliani and ban his Mkhedrioni militia in what was proclaimed as a strike against "mafia forces". However, his government—and his own family—became increasingly associated with pervasive corruption that hampered Georgia's economic growth. He won presidential elections in November 1995 and April 2000 with large majorities, but there were persistent allegations of vote-rigging.
The war in Chechnya caused considerable friction with Russia, which accused Georgia of harbouring Chechen guerrillas. Further friction was caused by Shevardnadze's close relationship with the United States, which saw him as a counterbalance to Russian influence in the strategic Transcaucasus region. Georgia became a major recipient of US foreign and military aid, signed a strategic partnership with NATO and declared an ambition to join both NATO and the EU. In 2002, the United States sent hundreds of Special Operations Forces to train the Military of Georgia—a programme known as the Georgia Train and Equip Program. Perhaps most significantly, the country secured a $3 billion project for a Caspian-Mediterranean pipeline (Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline)
A powerful coalition of reformists headed by Mikheil Saakashvili and Zurab Zhvania united to oppose Shevardnadze's government in the November 2, 2003 parliamentary elections. The elections were widely regarded as blatantly rigged, including by OSCE observers; in response, the opposition organised massive demonstrations in the streets of Tbilisi. After two tense weeks, Shevardnadze resigned on November 23, 2003, and was replaced as president on an interim basis by Burjanadze.
These results were annulled by the Georgia Supreme Court after the Rose Revolution on November 25, 2003, following allegations of widespread electoral fraud and large public protests, which led to the resignation of Shevardnadze.
Saakashvili presidency (2004-2013).
A new election was held on March 28, 2004. The National Movement - Democrats (NMD), the party supporting Mikheil Saakashvili, won 67% of the vote; only the Rightist Opposition (7.6%) also gained parliamentary representation passing the 7% threshold.
On January 4, Mikheil Saakashvili won the Georgian presidential election, 2004 with an overwhelming majority of 96% of the votes cast. Constitutional amendments were rushed through Parliament in February strengthening the powers of the President to dismiss Parliament and creating the post of Prime Minister. Zurab Zhvania was appointed Prime Minister. Nino Burjanadze, the interim President, became Speaker of Parliament.
The new president faced many problems on coming to office. More than 230,000 internally displaced persons put an enormous strain on the economy. Peace in the separatist areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, overseen by Russian and United Nations peacekeepers in the framework of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, remained fragile.
The Rose Revolution raised many expectations, both domestically and abroad. The new government was expected to bring democracy, ending a period of widespread corruption and government inefficiency; and to complete state-building by re-asserting sovereignty over the whole Georgian territory. Both aims were very ambitious; the new ruling elite initiated a process of concentration of power in the hands of the executive, in order to use the revolutionary mandate to change the country. In fact, the Saakashvili government initially achieved impressive results in strengthening the capacity of the state and toppling corruption; but such achievements could only result from the use of unilateral executive powers, failing to achieve consent and initiating a trade-off between democracy-building and state-building.
After the Rose Revolution, relations between the Georgian government and semi-separatist Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze deteriorated rapidly, with Abashidze rejecting Saakashvili's demands for the writ of the Tbilisi government to run in Ajaria. Both sides mobilised forces in apparent preparations for a military confrontation. Saakashvili's ultimatums and massive street demonstrations forced Abashidze to resign and flee Georgia (2004 Adjara crisis).
Relations with Russia remained problematic due to Russia's continuing political, economic and military support to separatist governments in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russian troops still remained garrisoned at two military bases and as peacekeepers in these regions. Saakashvili's public pledge to resolve the matter provoked criticism from the separatist regions and Russia. In August 2004, several clashes occurred in South Ossetia.
On October 29, 2004, the North Atlantic Council (NAC) of NATO approved the Individual Partnership Action Plan of Georgia (IPAP), making Georgia is the first among NATO's partner countries to manage this task successfully.
Georgia supported the coalition forces in Iraq war. On November 8, 2004, 300 extra Georgian troops were sent to Iraq. The Georgian government committed to send a total of 850 troops to Iraq to serve in the protection forces of the UN Mission. Along with increasing Georgian troops in Iraq, the US will train additional 4 thousand Georgian soldiers within frames of the Georgia Train-and-Equip Program (GTEP).
In February 2005 Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania died, and Zurab Nogaideli was appointed as the new Prime Minister.
Saakashvili remained under significant pressure to deliver on his promised reforms. Organisations such as Amnesty International have pushed serious concerns over human rights. Discontent over unemployment, pensions and corruption, and the continuing dispute over Abkhazia, have greatly diminished Saakashvili's popularity in the country.
In 2006 Georgia's relationship with Russia was at nadir due to the Georgian-Russian espionage controversy and related events. In 2007, a political crisis led to serious anti-government protests, and Russia allegedly led a series of airspace violations against Georgia.
Since the weakening of the democratic credentials of the Saakashvili cabinet after the police crackdown of the 2007 protests, the government has put the stress on his successful economic reforms. Kakha Bendukidze was pivotal in the libertarian reforms launched under Saakashvili, including one of the least restrictive labour codes, the lowest flat income tax rates (12%) and some of the lowest customs rates worldwide, along with the drastic reduction of necessary licenses and permits for business. The objective of the Georgian elite switched to the aim of "a functioning democracy with the highest possible level of economic liberties", as expressed by the prime minister Lado Gurgenidze.
Saakashvili called new parliamentary and presidential elections for January 2008. In order to contest the presidential election, Saakashvili announced his resignation effective 25 November 2007, with Nino Burjanadze becoming acting president for a second time (until the election returned Saakashvili to office on 20 January 2008).
In August 2008 Russia and Georgia engaged in the 2008 South Ossetia war. Its aftermath, leading to the 2008–2010 Georgia–Russia crisis, is still tense.
In October 2012, Saakashvili admitted defeat for his party in parliamentary elections. In his speech he said that "the opposition has the lead and it should form the government - and I as president should help them with this." This represented the first democratic transition of power in Georgia's post-Soviet history.

Operation Strikeback

Operation Strikeback was a major naval exercise of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that took place over a ten-day period in September 1957.
As part of a series of exercises to simulate an all-out Soviet attack on NATO, Operation Strikeback was tasked with two objectives. Its initial objective was the deployment of NATO's naval forces (designated the "Blue Fleet") against other NATO forces attempting to simulate an "enemy" navy that featured a large number of submarines (designated the "Orange Fleet"). Its other objective was to have the Blue Fleet execute carrier-based air strikes against "enemy" formations and emplacements along NATO's northern flank in Norway.
Operation Strikeback involved over 200 warships, 650 aircraft, and 75,000 personnel from the United States Navy, the United Kingdom's Royal Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, the French Navy, the Royal Netherlands Navy, and the Royal Norwegian Navy. As the largest peacetime naval operation up to that time, military analyst Hanson W. Baldwin of the "New York Times" characterized Operation Strikeback as "constituting the strongest striking fleet assembled since World War II."
Operation Strikeback and the other concurrent NATO exercises held during the fall of 1957 would be the most ambitious military undertaking for the alliance to date, involving more than 250,000 men, 300 ships, and 1,500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey.
Background.
Strategic overview.
Faced with the overwhelming numerical superiority of Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact military forces, NATO embraced the concept of the nuclear umbrella to protect Western Europe from a Soviet ground invasion. This strategy was initially articulated in January 1954 by U.S. Army General and then-Supreme Allied Commander Europe Alfred Gruenther: 
This strategic concept reflected the American strategy of massive retaliation of the Eisenhower administration as set forth by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles:
NATO military command structure.
With the establishment of NATO’s Allied Command Atlantic (ACLANT) on 30 January 1952, the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) joined the previously-created Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) as one of the alliance’s two principal military field commanders. Also, a Channel Command was established on 21 February 1952 to control the English Channel and North Sea area and deny it to the enemy, protect the sea lanes of communication, and Support operations conducted by SACEUR and SACLANT. The following key NATO military commands were involved in a series of alliance-wide exercises, including Operation Strikeback, during the Fall of 1957.
Operational history.
As part of the response to a theoretical Soviet attack against NATO on all fronts, Operation Strikeback would test the capabilities of Allied naval forces ("Blue Fleet") by tasking them to destroy the enemy navy ("Orange Fleet") and its huge submarine fleet, protect transatlantic shipping, and undertake sustained carrier-based air strikes against the enemy positions.
Beginning on 3 September 1957, American and Canadian naval forces got underway to join British, French, Dutch, and Norwegian naval forces in eastern Atlantic and northern European waters under the overall command of Vice Admiral Robert B. Pirie, United States Navy, the Commander of the U.S. Second Fleet, acting as NATO's Commander Striking Fleet Atlantic (COMSTRIKFLTLANT). While en route, the U.S.-Canadian naval forces executed "Operation Seaspray", a bilateral naval exercise to protect Blue Fleet’s vitally-important underway replenishment group (URG) from enemy submarine attacks. The nuclear submarine and the conventional submarine completed operations in the Arctic and joined 34 other U.S. and allied submarines temporarily assigned to the Orange Fleet. USS "Mount McKinley" was based in Portsmouth Naval Base as the command communications base for the Orange forces controlling Comsuborangelant/Comphiborangelant for the duration of the Exercise.
Operation Strikeback itself began on 19 September 1957, involving over 200 warships, 650 aircraft, and 65,000 personnel. To provide a more realistic simulation of protecting transatlantic shipping, over 200 merchant marine vessels, including the ocean liners and , also participated as duly-flagged target ships for the exercise. Blue Fleet hunter-killer (HUK) groups centered around the carriers , , and , as well as submarines and land-based anti-submarine patrol aircraft, executed "Operation Fend Off/Operation Fishplay" to identify, track, and contain the breakout of the enemy Orange Fleet’s submarine force along the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap (GIUK gap").
Operating above the Arctic Circle in the Norwegian Sea, the Blue Fleet, which included the new U.S. supercarriers and , launched carried-based air strikes against enemy positions in Norway. "Time" magazine provided the following contemporary coverage of Operation Strikeback:
Following the conclusion of Operation Strikeback, U.S. naval forces conducted "Operation Pipedown", involving the protection of its underway replenishment group while en route back the United States.
SACLANT Admiral Jerauld Wright, United States Navy, described Operation Strikeback as being "remarkably successful" while also noting " there is considerable scarcity of both naval and air forces in the eastern Atlantic." Wright’s Eastern Atlantic allied commander, Vice Admiral Sir John Eccles, RN, also noted:
Particularly significant was the performance of nuclear-powered submarines with the U.S. Navy's first two such vessels, the and , participating in Operation Strikeback. According to naval analyst-historian Norman Friedman, "Nautilus" "presented a greater threat than all 21 snorkel submarines combined" during Operation Strikeback, making 16 successful attacks against various naval formations while maintaining effective on-station tactical and high-speed pursuit capabilities. "Nautilus" cruised 3,384 nautical miles (6,267 km) with an average speed of 14.4 knots (26.7 km/h). In addition to the "Nautilus", the "Seawolf" departed New London on 3 September for Operation Strikeback. Before she surfaced off Newport, Rhode Isand, on 25 September, "Seawolf" had remained submerged for 16 days, cruising a total of 6,331 miles (10,189 km). Recognizing the need to meet this Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) challenge, the following actions were taken:
Operation Strikeback was the final deployment for the battleships and until their re-activation in the 1980s by the Reagan Administration. Finally, on the technical level, Operation Strikeback saw the first use of single sideband (SSB) voice communications for tactical operations by the United States Navy, and was the first Royal Navy carrier to use a magnetic loop communication system.
In addition to Operation Strikeback, which concentrated on its eastern Atlantic/northern European flank, NATO also conducted two other major military exercises in September 1957, Operation Counter Punch involving Allied Forces Central Europe on the European mainland and Operation Deep Water involving NATO's southern flank in the Mediterranean Sea.

Holland's Leaguer

"Holland's Leaguer" is a Caroline era stage play, a comedy written by Shackerley Marmion. It premiered onstage in 1631 and was first published in 1632. The play was a popular success and a scandal in its own day — scandalous because it dealt with a well-known London brothel.
"Leaguer".
In its literal sense, the term "leaguer" refers to a military encampment; Shakespeare uses the word in this original sense in "All's Well That Ends Well", Act III, scene 6, line 26: "the leaguer of the adversaries." By the 1630s the word had become a slang term for a whorehouse, as here in this play, or in the 1640 play "The Knave in Grain".
Performance.
"Holland's Leaguer" was acted in December 1631 by Prince Charles's Men at the Salisbury Court Theatre. It ran for six straight performances – which was highly unusual in the repertory system in which playing companies then operated, with a different play every day. The greatest theatrical success of the era, "A Game at Chess", ran for nine straight performances in 1624; "The Late Lancashire Witches" ran for three straight days in 1634.
The same company would stage Marmion's next play, "A Fine Companion", a year or so after his first.
Publication.
The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 26 January 1632, and was published in quarto later that year by the bookseller John Grove. The title page of the first edition states that the drama was acted by "the high and mighty Prince Charles's Men." This was ironic: the company was newly established, under the formal patronage of the then Prince Charles, later King Charles II — who was all of eighteen months old at the time. (An earlier version of the troupe had operated in the 1612–25 period under the same name, when it referred to the baby Charles's father, Charles I.)
Their theatre also was new, first built in 1629 by Richard Gunnell and William Blagrave; the play's Prologue refers to the theatre's location, between the Blackfriars to its east and the Cockpit to its west.
The cast.
The first edition also includes a cast list of the original production. This was a new feature in printed playbooks of the time; the earliest had appeared in the first edition of "The Duchess of Malfi" in 1623, with others following in "The Roman Actor" (printed 1629), and "The Picture" and "The Renegado" ( both printed 1630).
The cast list for "Holland's Leaguer" gives this information:
In addition to being a popular comic actor, Andrew Cane was a working goldsmith who brought his goldsmith apprentices into the theatre, as boy players filling female roles. In this production, both Arthur Savill and John Wright were such apprentice goldsmith/actors. (Wright and Samuel Mannery would be in Beeston's Boys in 1639.)
William Browne, who played the protagonist Philautus, was the son of Robert Browne and Susan Baskervile. Thomas Bond, who played Miscellanio, was William Browne's brother-in-law.
Place realism.
Marmion's play is an exercise in "place realism," in which dramatists exploited actual locales around London for their works – something that became fashionable in the drama of the early 1630s. James Shirley's "Hyde Park" (1632) and Thomas Nabbes's "Covent Garden" (1633) and "Tottenham Court" (1634) participated this trend, as did several of the dramas of Richard Brome.
Earlier playwrights had also experimented with place realism, as in Lording Barry's "Ram Alley" (c. 1607) and Ben Jonson's "Bartholomew Fair" (1614). Indeed, the publication of Jonson's play in 1631 may have been important in initiating the Caroline fashion. Marmion was one of the Sons of Ben, self-professed followers of Jonson; and "Holland's Leaguer" bears resemblances to several Jonson plays, most notably "The Alchemist".
The brothel.
The actual brothel called Holland's Leaguer was located on the Bankside, on the southern shore of the River Thames across from London. It was situated in the liberty of Paris Garden, in a street that is still known as Holland Street. The building had formerly been the Paris Garden manor house, and was equipped with a moat, portcullis, and drawbridge. Brothels were commonly located on the Bankside, to be outside the control of the London civil authorities – just as the theatres were. Henry VIII had suppressed the Bankside whorehouses in the 1540s; but his measures were only temporarily effective.
Holland was reportedly the name of the woman who ran the establishment — though a popular rumour also linked the house specifically with Dutch prostitutes.
The brothel was a topical subject in 1631, because it had been attacked and damaged during the annual Shrove Tuesday tumult by the London apprentices. Shrove Tuesday (the day before Ash Wednesday) was the 'prentices' holiday, and they often celebrated by running wild and causing destruction. (The Cockpit Theatre was damaged in their Shrove Tuesday rioting on 4 March 1617.) Brothels were a regular target of the 'prentices. The play refers directly to this riotous habit, in Act IV scene 3:
Pamphlet and ballad.
Marmion was not the only writer to take advantage of the brothel's notoriety. Also in 1632, two other works on the subject appeared: a ballad by Lawrence Price called "News from Holland's Leader", and a pamphlet from bookseller Richard Barnes. Authored by a Nicholas Goodman, the pamphlet is titled "Holland's Leaguer: or a Historical Discourse of the Life and Actions of Dona Britanica Hollandia, the Arch-Mistress of the wicked women of Eutopis. Wherein is detected the notorious Sin of Panderism, and the Execrable Life of the luxurious impudent." Goodman's essay shows how the subject was perceived (and exploited) at the time, though it offers little dependable information.
Synopsis.
The play's main plot centres upon Philautus, a fashionable young lord; abetted by hangers-on like Ardelio, he has become devoted to vanity and self-absorption – to the displeasure of his wife, Triphoena. Philautus also considers himself a ladies' man (though he is more oriented toward flirting and ego-gratification than actual adultery). His loyal friend Fidelio concocts a scheme to cure Philautus of his follies and restore him to virtue and self-respect. Fidelio wants Philautus to fall in love with a beautiful young woman who will reject him over his shallowness. Fidelio intends it as a therapeutic shock.
For his woman of virtue, Fidelio plans to employ his own fiancé, Faustina. They have been contracted for the past six years; Faustina's father, cool to the match, gained his daughter's promise to live in seclusion for seven years before marrying. Though the father is dead, Faustina loyally maintains her commitment to the seven-year vow. Initially suspicious of the plan, Faustina is won over by Fidelio's arguments. She plays her part in the scheme – which is a success: her rejection shocks Philautus into abandoning his butterfly life. He goes off to the wars in the Netherlands, and returns with honour.
The trick of the matter is that Philautus and Faustina are brother and sister. When he first meets her, Philautus remarks that he has a sister with the same name; but he is no smarter than many other protagonists in English Renaissance comedy, and does not realise that the two Faustinas are one until the final Act of the drama. The six-year separation is supposed to have made them relative strangers. In the realisation scene, Philautus says, "Let me look upon her" — which suggests that she was veiled or masked earlier, making his failure to recognise her perhaps more plausible (somewhat).
The play's subplot deals with a group of would-be gallants, including Triphoena's bashful brother Capritio, his tutor Miscellanio, and the flamboyant Trimalchio. They fall victim to the manipulations of two tricksters, Agurtes and his confederate Autolicus. The subplot is a negative mirror-image of the main plot; as Philautus is tricked out of his vices through his attraction to Faustina, so Capritio and Trimalchio are tricked out of a diamond and a pocket watch by Argutes' daughter Millicent. In pursuit of the gallant's lifestyle, the play's four gulls (Ardelio, Trimalchio, Capritio, and Miscellanio) end up at Holland's Leaguer in Act IV, where they are more abused than satisfied by the denizens of Mistress Holland's house. They think they are arrested by the constables and the night watch — though these are actually Argutes and Autolicus and their henchmen, disguised.
In the end, Ardelio is dismissed by Philautus, and the other gulls are reformed, at least to the point of entering into the marriages that normally end a comedy. Trimalchio marries Millicent, under the illusion that she is a duke's daughter; Capritio marries her maid Margery, while Miscellanio weds Quartilla, Triphoena's gentlewoman.

John Bartholomew, Sr.

John Bartholomew, Sr. (April 26, 1805 – April 8, 1861) was a Scottish cartographer and engraver. 
The son of George Bartholomew (1784–1871), John founded the engraving and mapmaking firm of John Bartholomew and Son Ltd. in 1826.
He was a veritable master copper plate engraver. He engraved some fine maps for local firms, such as street maps for Lizars, others for the Encyclopædia Britannica and for some educational publishers like A & C Black. He was commissioned to engrave the map of Treasure Island for Robert Louis Stevenson.
John Sr. was the ideal person to inaugurate what became one of the most admired cartographic institutions in the world. A man of high standards, as were his successors; he was a superb engraver, engraving becoming the foundation of the firm; lithography would follow later. He also had the vision to recognise the potential for the firm. He was a shy man, holding back from public life.
In 1859, shortly before he died, John Senior passed the business on to his son John Bartholomew Junior (1831–1893).

Rail transport in the Soviet Union

The Soviet Union was heavily dependent on rail transport, not least during the Russian Civil War and the World War II, but also for industrialization according to the five-year plans.
During the Soviet era, freight rail traffic increased 55 times, passenger traffic almost 10 times, and the length of the rail network almost doubled. The Soviet Union had a railway network of (excluding industrial railways, of which were electrified.
Rail traffic in Soviet Union.
Rail traffic problems in the early Soviet Union.
After the foundation of the Soviet Union the People's Commissariat of Railways (after 1946 named the Ministry of Railways (МПС), the railway network expanded to a total length of 106,100 km by 1940. A notable project of the late 1920s and one of the centerpieces of the First Five-Year Plan was the Turkestan–Siberia Railway, linking Western Siberia via Eastern Kazakhstan with Uzbekistan.
As the quality of rail transport continued to deteriorate, in part because of the Russian Civil War, some within the Soviet leadership claimed that the railways were not sustainable if congestion continued to increase. Those who advocated an enlargement of rail transport felt that increased investment and the lengthening of already established rail tracks could solve the ongoing congestion crisis. The majority agreed on increasing investments, but there was no clear consensus on how these investments were to be used. There were even some who believed in the privatization of the railways. Gosplan economists in the meantime advocated the rationalization of the railways, coupled with tariffs based on actual cost, which would reduce traffic demand and provide funds for investment. The leadership was unable to reach a conclusion and the rail system continued to deteriorate. In 1931, in a Central Committee (CC) resolution, it was decided that increased investments coupled with the introduction of newer trains could solve the crisis. This resolution was never carried out, and yet again, the system continued to deteriorate. However, at the same time railway traffic was growing (See graph).
The Central Committee ordered Lazar Kaganovich to solve the railway crisis in 1935. Kaganovich first prioritized bottleneck areas over other less-traveled areas; his second priority was investing in heavy traffic lines, and thirdly, the least efficient areas of the rail network were left to themselves. Another problem facing rail transport was the massive industrialization efforts pushed on by the authorities. The industrialization proved to be a heavy burden on the railways, and Vyacheslav Molotov and Kaganovich even admitted this to the 18th party congress. Even so, the Soviet Government continued their industrialization efforts to better prepare themselves for a future war with Germany, which became reality in 1941.
Rail freight traffic in the Soviet Union.
The graph compares the freight traffic (in ton-km) of the USSR to the US. The USSR rebuilt its rail system and industrialized with five-year plans. As a result, railroad freight grew about 20 times from 20 to 400 billion tonne-km by 1941. But then disaster struck again: World War II in 1941 when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In the first year or so of the war, traffic plummeted to about half its prewar value. But then the USSR started restoring and constructing railroads during wartime so that by the end of the war about half of the lost traffic had been recovered. After the war was over it took a few more years to restore the railroads and get back to the pre-war level of traffic.
Then the USSR embarked on a series of more five-year plans and rail traffic rapidly increased. By 1954 their rail freight traffic (about 850 billion tonne-km) surpassed that of the United States and the USSR then hauled more rail freight than any other country in the world. Rail freight continued to rapidly increase in the USSR so that by 1960 the USSR was hauling about half of all railroad freight in the world (in tonne-km) and they did this on a rail system consisting of 10% of the world's railway kilometrage. The status of hauling half the world's rail freight continued for almost 30 years but in 1988 rail freight traffic peaked at 3852 billion tonne-km (nearly 4 trillion). This rapid growth may seem impressive, but it was in part a failure because rail traffic at times didn't grow fast enough to satisfy demand, partly due to congestion.
In 1991 the Soviet Union fell apart and its largest republic, the Russian Federation, which then hauled about 2/3 of the traffic of the former USSR, became an independent country. For the USSR in 1989, shortly before the collapse of Soviet Union, the railroads hauled nearly eight times as much ton-km of freight by rail as they did by highway truck. In 1991 a law was passed which declared that railroads were the basic transportation system of the USSR.
World War II.
During the World War II the railway system played a vital role in the war effort transporting military personnel, equipment and freight to the front lines and often evacuating entire factories and towns from European Russia to the Ural region and Siberia. The loss of mining and industrial centers of the western Soviet Union necessitated speedy construction of new railways during the wartime. Particularly notable among them was the railway to the Arctic coal mines of Vorkuta, extended after the war to Labytnangi on the Ob River; construction work to extend it all the way to the Yenisey continued into the 1950s, aborted with the death of Joseph Stalin.
As a result of Japan's loss in World War II, the southern half of Sakhalin Island was annexed by Soviet Union in 1945. The 1067 mm railway network built by the Japanese during their forty years of control of southern Sakhalin now became part of Soviet Railways as well (as a separate Sakhalin Railway), the only Cape gauge rail system within USSR (or today's Russia). The original Japanese D51 steam locomotives were used by the Soviet Railways on Sakhalin Island until 1979, together with regauged ShA USATC S160 Class locomotives.
Post-war development.
After the war the Soviet railway network was re-built and further expanded to more than 145,000 km of track by major additions such as Baikal Amur Mainline.
Soviet rail transport became, after the World War II, one of the most developed in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639 km a year from 1965 to 1980. This steady growth in rail transport can be explained by the country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or in Siberia. While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling one of the most electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place.
The efficiency of the railways improved over time, and by the 1980s Soviet railways had become the most intensively used in the world. Most Soviet citizens did not own private transport, and if they did, it was difficult to drive long distances due to the poor conditions of many roads. Another explanation has to do with Soviet policy, the first being the autarkic model created by Joseph Stalin's regime. Stalin's regime had little interest in rail transport, or any other form for transport, and instead focused most of the country's investments in rapid industrialization. Stalin's regime was not interested in establishing new railway lines, but decided to conserve, and later expand, much of the existing railways left behind by the Tsars. However, as Lev Voronin, a First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union, noted in a speech to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1989 that the railway sector was the "main negative sector of the economy in 1989". As industrial output declined in the late-1980s so did the demand for transportation.
USSR vs. USA: Were the Soviets More Efficient?
The efficiency of the Soviet Railways improved over time and by the 1980s had many performance indicators superior to the United States. Railroads built in the USSR were planned, and in contrast to the US, only a single railroad line would be constructed between major cities. This avoided the situation in the US where two (or sometimes more) railroad companies would construct lines that more or less paralleled each other resulting in wasteful duplication of effort. But most of the rail lines in the USSR were inherited from the Russian Empire which had also avoided such duplication.
As a result of having a shorter rail system plus more freight traffic, the USSR had a freight traffic density (in ton-km per km of line) 6-7 times higher than the US. In the US, the mean daily freight car mileage was only 95 km. vs. 227 km. for the USSR. The percent of freight car miles that ran empty was 41% for the US vs. 29% for the USSR. It was claimed that labor productivity rose 4.3 fold between 1955 and 1980, resulting in the USSR being roughly the same as the US (after taking into account that the USSR hauled a greater proportion of non-bulk commodities which were more labor-intensive to haul—more switching of cars, etc.).
The Soviet Union made the transition to automatic brakes and couplers long after the United States did and as a result their brakes and couplers were more advanced.
Their (air) brakes could operate in a mode where it was possible to slowly reduce braking effort, while the US system required full release of the brakes (in the entire train) and reapplication of the brakes in order to reduce braking effort.
The Soviet Union developed advanced machinery for track maintenance and renewal such as a Continuous Action Tamping Machine which in 1977 could move at 3 km/hr and also straighten the track and dress the ballast. It was model ВПО-3000 (VPO-3000) and at that time no such machinery like this existed outside of the Soviet Union. It was claimed to be several times faster than non-Soviet tamping machinery of cyclical action.
However, the reliability of locomotives in the USSR was much worse than for the US. Their high traffic density often resulted in traffic congestion and delays, especially after an accident blocked the line.
Congestion and failure to transport.
Harm to the Soviet Economy.
The railroad system in the Soviet Union (mostly after the 1920s) was utilized several times more intensively than the railways of developed capitalist countries. The high traffic volumes per kilometer of line resulted in congestion problems that at times became so severe that goods available for transport could not be shipped and factories, etc. were forced to slow production. This happened in the 1930s and during the so-called Brezhnev stagnation starting in the late 1970s and beyond. In 1989 the President of the Council of Ministers of the USSR stated that economists estimate that the failure of railroads to provide adequate transportation, costs the Soviet economy 10-12 billion rubles per year.
Train flow basics.
Congestion on a railroad line is different than congestion and traffic jams of motor vehicles on highways. The flow on a transportation route (in tons/hour, trains/day, etc.) is simply equal to the product of velocity and linear density (gross tons/meter or trains/km etc.). For a railroad line as a whole (in one direction), one would use the average linear density along the whole line, where most points on the line have no trains on them and thus have zero density there. Thus less spacing between trains (or motor vehicles) tends to increase the average density and thus increase the flow (if the velocity remains the same). For motor vehicles, when traffic speed slows, the vehicles closely follow each other and this tends to increase flow and partially (or even fully) compensate for the loss of velocity. But under normal conditions of train operation, they can't closely follow each other. This is partly because the Automatic block signalling system maintains a minimum distance between trains (moving under the green signal aspect). On single track lines between passing sidings, trains can't travel in opposite directions at the same time. If they tried to do this, they would either collide head on with each other (if they were headed toward each other) or they would need to have magically passed thru each other (if they are moving away from each other). This poses a further restriction in train spacing.
Increasing freight density.
One expedient is to reduce the spacing between 2 or 3 trains to zero by running "connected" trains. One simply couples two or more trains together without connecting the braking systems of the 2 trains. The locomotive crews then coordinate their handing of the train by radio. If they don't coordinate properly, the combined train can derail due to high forces in the train. This method was used in the Soviet Union mostly as a temporary expedient and almost never as a standard operating procedure.
In the mid-1980s about 70% of the Soviet network was single track lines.
It was proposed to select two large end stations on a single track line that have enough trackage to hold several trains. Then opposing trains accumulate at such stations and the trains that accumulated at one end station then proceed down the rail line closely spaced (a packet of trains) while traffic in the opposite opposing direction is spread out and yields (by hiding in the passing sidings) to the packet so that the packet of trains can travel non-stop over a significant distance. Later on, a non-stop packet can be formed in the other direction, etc. Using packets to increase capacity was common in the USSR.
Railroad labor.
Amenities for rail workers.
Especially in the 1970s, some railroad depots/shops provided a good workplace environment and whole books were written on this subject, sometimes called "production esthetics" (производственная эстетика). An example was at the mechanized track maintenance station ПМС-121 (PMS-121) (in 2013 ЦMПР) near Kiev in the Ukraine. For the workers they installed showers, a shoe repair shop, a barber shop, a laundry, a small store, a club with a capacity of 200 persons, a lounge, and an art studio. In the track assembly plant (they prefabricated lengths of track, with rails attached to ties) they installed facilities for heating (and eating) food, a reading room, and a billiard room. They also provided improved amenities when workers traveled to work on remote sections of track and lived in dormitory rail cars. As a result of the improved amenities, it's claimed that employee turnover was reduced from 63% (per year) to 11%.
Production esthetics included planting of greenery, providing proper lighting and colors, background music, sports area.
Rail transit.
The Soviet rapid transit system was seen as the cheapest way of urban transport, and eventually another point acquired greater significance; the authorities could allocate their resources from the automobile industry to the rapid transit sector and save a substantial volume of the country's diesel and petrol. Because rapid transit system usually were cheaper to operate and less energy consuming, the Soviet authorities managed to construct 20 rapid transits nationwide, with a further nine in construction when the Soviet Union collapsed. Twenty other stations were under construction in 1985. The country's rapid transit system was the most intensively used in the world.
Dieselization.
The Soviet Union was a pioneer in the development of the diesel locomotive to replace the steam locomotive (dieselization) on non-electrified lines. But the USSR failed to make steady progress and while they lead the United States at first, they soon fell behind and their last steam locomotives were retired about 15 years later than for the US. The first mainline diesel locomotive in the world began running in 1924 in the USSR but it had an excessive number of breakdowns so other designs of diesel locomotives were developed and used in desert regions where water for steam locomotives was scarce. Then in 1937 the small scale production (only several units per year) of diesel locomotives (for desert use) came to a halt by order of Kaganovich, the head of the national railway committee (NKPS) and a leading figure in the Communist party.
In the late 1930s, Interest in diesel's was rekindled by reports from the US that production of diesel locomotives was overtaking production of steam locomotives. The USSR was able to order 100 of them via lend lease but they didn't begin arriving in the USSR until the start of 1945 when the war was almost over.
Electrification.
As compared to the U.S., the Soviet Union got off to a very slow start in electrification but later greatly surpassed the US. Electrification in the US reached its maximum in the late 1930s which is just when electrification was getting its start in the USSR.
Post-Soviet rail traffic.
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, railroad traffic in Russia sharply declined and new major electrification projects were not undertaken except for the line to Murmansk which was completed in 2005. Work continued on completing the electrification of the Trans-Siberian Railway, but at a slower pace, finishing in 2002. However, the percent of tonne-kilometers hauled today by electric trains has increased to about 85%.

<doc id="18868543" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18868543" title="Climate of Malta">
Climate of Malta

Malta has a Subtropical-Mediterranean climate according to the Köppen climate classification ("Csa"), with very mild winters and warm to hot summers. Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification and the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification, Malta lies within the subtropical zone. According to International Living, Malta is the state with the best climate in the world.
Temperature.
The average yearly temperature is around during the day and at night (one of the warmest temperature averages in Europe). In the coldest month – January – the typical maximum temperature ranges from during the day and the minimum from at night. In the warmest month – August – the typical maximum temperature ranges from during the day and the minimum from at night. 
Generally, the summer/holiday season lasts around 8 months, starting from around mid-April with temperatures from during the day and at night, and ending in November with temperatures from during the day and at night. However even in the remaining 4 months of the year temperatures sometimes reach . Amongst all capitals in the continent of Europe, Valletta – the capital of Malta has the warmest winters, with average temperatures of around during the day and at night in the months of January and February. In March and December average temperatures are around during the day and at night. The average number of days above is 15, most of which occur during July and August. In Malta large fluctuations in temperature are rare. Also, Malta is one of the few places in Europe which is "green" all year round (vegetation does not die during the winter).
Daylight.
Malta enjoys one of the most optimal number of hours of daylight in Europe. Days in winter are not as short as in the northern part of the continent, the average hours of daylight in December, January and February is 10.3 hours (for comparison: London or Moscow or Warsaw - about 8 hours). The shortest day of the year - 21 December - sunrise is around 7:00 and sunset is around 17:00. The longest day of the year - 21 June - sunrise is around 5:30 and sunset is around 20:30.
Sunshine.
As one might expect from Malta's high daylight hours, Malta enjoys around 3,000 hours of sunshine per year (also one of the highest in Europe), from an average of above 5 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of above 12 hours of sunshine per day in July. Thus, Malta enjoys about twice the amount of sunshine as cities in the northern half of Europe. For comparison, London has 1,461 hours per year; however, in winter Malta has much more sunshine. For comparison, London has 37 hours while Malta has 161 hours of sunshine in December.
Sea temperature.
Average annual temperature of sea is (the highest annual sea temperature in Europe), from in the period from January to April to in August. In the 6 months from June to November, the average sea temperature exceeds . In May and December - the transition months - the average is around .
In the second half of April, which is the beginning of the summer/holiday season the average sea temperature is . The highest sea temperature is in the middle-3rd week of August. In late August and early September the temperature drops to , and in the second half of September it drops to . Around mid-October it drops to , and during the last week of October it drops to . By early November the temperature drops to (data of 2010).
Precipitation.
Water supply poses a problem on Malta, as the summer is both rainless and the time of greatest water use, and the winter rainfall often falls as heavy showers running off to the sea rather than soaking into the ground. Malta depends on underground reserves of fresh water, drawn through a system of water tunnels called the Ta' Kandja galleries, which average about 97 m below surface and extend like the spokes of a wheel. In the galleries in Malta's porous limestone, fresh water lies in a lens upon brine. More than half the potable water of Malta is produced by desalination, which creates further issues of fossil fuel use and pollution.
Malta has an average of 90 precipitation days a year, and experiences from a few to a dozen rainy days per month (≥ 1 mm), ranging from 0.5 of a day in July to around 15 in December. The average annual precipitation is around 600 mm, ranging from ~0.3 mm in July to ~110 mm in December.
Humidity.
The annual average relative humidity is 73%, ranging from 65% in July (morning: 78% evening: 53%) to 78% in December (morning: 83% evening: 73%).
Records.
Despite the relative stasis of the Maltese climate, historical records present some variations. In the capital city of Valletta, meteorological officials of the time recorded a temperature of on 19 February 1895, which remains a record for the city. Regarding the island as a whole, a temperature of was recorded on 1 February 1962, at Ta' Qali airfield, in the centre of the island, which was pelted first by frozen precipitation (hail), and later in the day covered by snowfall that lasted through the night. Snow, which is virtually unheard of, is officially on the record books of the past 200 years as having occurred in January 1858 (widespread snowfall), March 1877 (light snow without accumulation), February 1895 (snow squalls without accumulation), January 1905 (flurries without accumulation), March 1949 (snow recorded in the interior of the island), and 31 January 1962. On the last of these dates, January 1962, some parts of the interior of the island were covered by snow for the majority of the day, and the following night, 1 February, marks the only event in the history of Malta in which frost was recorded.

A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson

A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson was written by Thomas Tyers for "The Gentleman's Magazine'"s December 1784 issue. The work was written immediately after the death of Samuel Johnson and is the first postmortem biographical work on the author. The first full length biography was written by John Hawkins and titled "Life of Samuel Johnson".
Background.
There is little known about the relationship that Johnson and Tyers shared, except that Johnson claimed that "Tyers always tells him something he did not know before" and was familiarly mentioned by Johnson to Johnson's friends. However, Johnson, in "The Idler", described Tyers, called Tom Restless, as "a circumstance" and says: 
"When Tom Restless rises he goes into a coffee-house, where he creeps so near to men whom he takes to be reasoners, as to hear their discourses and endeavours to remember something which, when it has been strained through Tom's head, is so near to nothing, that what it once was cannot be discovered. This he carries round from friend to friend through a circle of visits, till, hearing what each says upon the question, he becomes able at dinner to say a little himself; and as every great genius relaxes himself among his inferiors, meets with some who wonder how so young a man can talk so wisely." 
On 13 December 1784, Samuel Johnson died. In response to his death, the "Gentleman's Magazine" ran "A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson" for their December issue. The work was written in the short time between the death and the printing. Although it was the first biographical work on Johnson, the first full length biography would be published by Murphy in 1787.
Biography.
Tyers used his "Biographical Sketch" to discuss Johnson's mental state, but not everyone agreed with the way Tyers revealed Johnson's private life; Hester Thrale wrote, in her "Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson", "Poor Johnson! I see they will leave "nothing untold" that I laboured so long to keep secret; & I was so very delicate in trying to conceal his fancied Insanity." Regardless of what Thrale may have wanted, critics focused on Johnson's mental state from then after. In particular, John Wain emphasizes Tyers's description of Johnson as "like a ghost. He never speaks unless he is spoken to", which Wain considered a "bon mot". Likwise, Walter Jackson Bate relies on how Tyers was able to partly capture Johnson's "bisociative" ability to bring "together two different frames of experience". Tyers, when saying Johnson "said the most common things in the "newest" manner", describes Johnson's "unpreditability" and a 
"further process of mind in which the original shuffling of perspectives, already surprising us with elements we had overlooked or forgotten, is joined by considerations drawn from other matrices of experience that can only be described as 'moral,' that is, having to do with the condition of man - with human hopes and fears; with values, purpose or aim; with the shared sense, never forgotten, of the 'doom of man'; and with an unsleeping practical urgency in considering concretely what to do and how to live."
Tyers concludes his work by saying:
"At the end of this sketch, it may be hinted (sooner might have been prepossession) that Johnson told this writer, for he saw he always had his eye and ear upon him, that at some time or other he might be called upon to assist a posthumous account of him.
A hint was given to our author, a few years ago, by this Rhapsodist, to write his own life, lest somebody should write it for him. He has reason to believe, he has left a manuscript biography behind him. His executors, all honourable men, will sit in judgment upon his papers. Thuanus, Buchanan, Huetius, and others, have been their own historians.
The memory of some people, says Mably very lately, 'is their understanding.' This may be thought, by some readers, to be the case in point. Whatever anecdotes were furnished by memory, this pen did not choose to part with to any compiler. His little bit of gold he has worked into as much gold-leaf as he could
Critical response.
James Boswell, in his "Life of Samuel Johnson", wrote:
" abounded in anecdote, but was no sufficiently attentive to accuracy. I therefore cannot venture to avail myself much of a biographical sketch of Johnson which he published, being one among the various persons ambitious of appending their names to that of my illustrious friend. That sketch is, however, an entertaining little collection of fragments."

Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales

The Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales (FELGTB; ) is the main LGBT organisation in Spain. FELGTB is characterised by demanding LGBT rights, at times through controversial campaigns. Its current chairman is Antoni Poveda.
In June 2008, the United Nations Economic and Social Council granted consultative status to FELGTB and COC Netherlands.
History.
In 1992 the National Federation of Gays and Lesbians (FELG; ) was founded, at the proposal of the Collective of Gays and Lesbienas of Madrid (COGAM) and other LGBT organisations based in Madrid following their separation from the historic organisation "Coordinadora de Frentes de Liberación Homosexual del Estado Español" (COFLHEE).
In time, some groups from different parts of Spain joined the Federation, such as some from Granada and Barcelona, but very slowly. It was the late 1990s when some of the main organisations of the country ("Gehitu" of the Basque Country, "Alega" of Cantabria, "Gamá" of the Canary Islands and the "Colectivo Lambda" of Valencia, among others) joined FELG in an attempt build unity to pressure for the approval of a law recognising common law partnerships. Currently, more than 30 associations of all types compose the FELGT.
Beginning in 2003, the FELGT was led by Beatriz Gimeno. Previously, Pedro Zerolo and Armand de Fluviá had occupied that position. In March 2007, Beatriz Gimeno decided to begin collaborating with the university and Antoni Poveda came to hold the position of president of the FELGT. In the same meeting it was decided to add the "B" for bisexual to the acronym.
2007 the official name became FELGTB, including bisexual option in the name.
Activism, campaigns, and polemics.
The FELGTB demands legal equality and social respect for diversity, is a promoter and convener (along with COGAM) of the national demonstration on the International Day of LGBT Pride (June 28), and fosters the training of its member associations' activists.
It has presented several controversial campaigns, such as "VOTA ROSA" ("VOTE PINK") and "2004 NO VOTES PP" ("2004 DON'T VOTE PP"). Beatriz Gimeno justified this last slogan by pointing out the necessity of a political change to "advance our demands". Esperanza Aguirre, in response to this campaign, stated that sexual orientation doesn't necessarily determine political orientation, and noted that she was convinced that "the majority of gays are going to vote for Esperanza, and are going to vote PP". Ana Botella, number two on the list of the PP in Madrid, limited herself to saying that the demands of the FELGT don't come within the rivalries of the town council.
During the negotiation of the same-sex marriage law in Spain, the FELGT criticized the performance of the PP at various times, especially for presenting as an expert the psychiatrist Aquilino Polaino, who claimed that homosexuality was a pathology. Parallelly, when the Pope visited Valencia, the FELGT participated in the "Jornadas Internacionales de Diversidad Familiar" (International Conference on Family Diversity) (subsidized by the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs) and signed up for the collective ""Jo no t'espere"" ("I don't wait for you"), which was criticized harshly by the Catholic media. Some of those organisations tried to take the FELGT to the attorney general for "the continuous offenses of gay activism".
On April 20, 2007, the FELGT described as "incoherent" Mariano Rajoy's declarations about gay weddings, since he was claiming that if his son marries a man he will attend his wedding, while his party has appealed the same-sex marriage law as unconstitutional.
On April 28, 2007, FELGT launched the campaign "Ni un céntimo para quien te discrimina" ("Not one cent for anyone who discriminates against you"), coinciding with the income tax filings, encouraging citizens to mark the "social purposes" box instead of the box designated for the Catholic Church.

Teton National Forest

Teton National Forest was first established by the General Land Office on February 22, 1897 as the Teton Forest Reserve with . A commission was established in 1896 to plan for a system of national forest reserves, recommending an expansion of the territory protected by the Yellowstone Timberland Reserve. President Grover Cleveland's 1897 proclamation established a protected area encompassing the northern end of Jackson Hole, extending from the south boundary of the Yellowstone Forest Reserve south to the area of the Gros Ventre River, and from the Idaho border in the west to the area of the Continental Divide in the east. Much of this area would eventually be incorporated into Grand Teton National Park. In 1902 the southern porion of the Yellowstone reserve was added, while the Teton Reserve was greatly expanded to the south and east while excluding the southern portion of Jackson Hole around the town of Jackson.
On January 29, 1903 it was combined with the Yellowstone Forest Reserve, but it was reinstated as a separate unit on July 1, 1908 with . In 1973 Teton National Forest was administratively combined with Bridger National Forest, creating Bridger-Teton National Forest. In descending order of land area, Teton National Forest is located in parts of Teton, Sublette, Park, Fremont, and Lincoln counties. It is now administrated as part of the Bridger-Teton National Forest from its headquarters in Jackson, but there are local ranger district offices in Jackson and Moran. The forest contains both the Gros Ventre Wilderness and the Teton Wilderness, both officially designated by the National Wilderness Preservation System.

1996–97 Australian region cyclone season

The 1996–97 Australian region cyclone season was an event in the ongoing cycle of tropical cyclone formation. It ran from 1 November 1996 to 30 April 1996. The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a "tropical cyclone year" separately from a "tropical cyclone season", and the "tropical cyclone year" ran from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997.
Tropical cyclones in this area were monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs): the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane; and TCWC Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.
__TOC__
Storms.
Tropical Cyclone Lindsay.
On 9 July, TCWC Perth reported that a tropical low had developed within the Near-equatorial trough of low pressure, located about 500 km (310 mi) to the northeast of the Cocos Islands. During that day the system moved to the southwest around a weak mid-upper level anticyclone, before it came under the starting to move southwards during 10 July. At 1000 UTC that day, TCWC Perth reported that the low had developed into a category one tropical cyclone, and named it Lindsay as the system reached its peak 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 75 km/h (45 mph). At 1500 UTC, the JTWC reported that Lindsay was becoming better organized and issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system. Six hours later while Lindsay was at its 1-minute peak intensity of 65 km/h (40 mph), the JTWC designated the system Tropical Cyclone 01S and started to issue warnings on it. After the JTWC had initiated warnings on the system, it began to rapidly weaken as it came under the influence of strong upper level north-westerlies. During the next day, both the JTWC and TCWC Perth issued their final advisories on Lindsay as it weakened below cyclone intensity and became extratropical. Lindsay's remnants were tracked as they moved towards the southeast until they were absorbed into a broad trough of low pressure on 13 July.
Tropical Cyclone Melanie-Bellamine.
Melanie formed from a low near Cocos Island on 30 October 1996. It deepened to a category 2 storm overnight on 1 November and it moved westwards, with a subsequent name change to Bellamine. It dissipated on 11 November. [http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/seasonsummary199697.shtml]
Tropical Cyclone Nicholas.
A tropical depression formed on 12 December 1996 near Timor. The depression moved south before being classified as a cyclone on 14 December and was named Nicholas. The storm made landfall west of Derby, Australia as a tropical storm on the 15th and dissipated the next day. [http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/seasonsummary199697.shtml]
Tropical Cyclone Ophelia.
Ophelia formed between two tropical cyclones, Nicholas (near the north Kimberley coast) and Elvina near 80°E, to the east of Christmas Island on 13 December 1996. Its track was somewhat unusual in that it moved towards the southeast for most of its lifetime. The weak cyclone had no impact on Christmas Island or northwest Australia and dissipated on 19 December. [http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/seasonsummary199697.shtml]
Tropical Cyclone Fergus.
Fergus was a Category 2 storm that formed in the Pacific Ocean, lasting from 29 December to 31 December 1996 until becoming extratropical near New Zealand. The storm dropped heavy rainfall across an already saturated area, with totals of over 16.5 inches (425 mm) near Thames. The rainfall led to widespread flooding and forced many to evacuate. Severe road damage occurred, with some roads remaining closed for over a week. Gusty winds from Fergus downed trees and power lines, and caused property damage.
Tropical Cyclone Phil.
A weak cyclone, Phil crossed the northern part of Australia between 26 December and 27 December 1996. The storm then moved westward where it encountered vertical wind shear and dissipated on 31 December. It reformed on 9 January 1997 and finally dissipated on 12 January.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Rachel.
The third and last cyclone to affect Western Australia, Cyclone Rachel formed on 3 January 1997. The storm reached Category 2 status as it moved southward. On 4 January the cyclone brushed Troughton Island and Kalumburu Community, Western Australia before making landfall in the north of the Kimberley region of Western Australia.
Rachel then swung back out to sea and hugged the coast before making a second landfall near Port Hedland. Moving inland the terran weakened the storm and Rachel dissipated on 8 January. [http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/seasonsummary199697.shtml]
Severe Tropical Cyclone Drena.
Cyclone Drena crossed from the South Pacific on 4 January with winds of 140 miles per hour. The storm again crossed out 2 days later.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Pancho-Helinda.
Pancho formed to the north of Cocos Islands during 20 January 1997. It moved south towards Cocos Islands, then moved southwest, intensifying rapidly to a Category 4 or Category 5 cyclone with an estimated central pressure of 925 hPa by the morning of 22 January. Pancho then was renamed Helinda by the Mauritiaun TCWC and weakened. By 29 January Pancho/Helinda was moving from the northwest towards Cocos Islands again, however again it changed direction to the southwest and reintensified to Category 4. It finally weakened to a tropical depression by 5 February. 
Tropical Cyclone Gillian.
Tropical Cyclone Gillian existed from 10 February to 12 February.
Tropical Cyclone Harold.
Tropical Cyclone Harold existed from 16 February to 21 February.
Tropical Cyclone Ita.
Tropical Cyclone Ita existed from 23 February to 24 February.
Tropical Cyclone Justin.
Justin had a long 3½ week life in March 1997. Peaking as a Category 4 cyclone, and making landfall as a Category 2, it caused significant damage in the Cairns region which it approached on two occasions.It was the largest cyclone to hit Northern Queensland in 1997. Houses were undermined by huge waves, a marina and boats were severely damaged, roads and bridges suffered from flood and landslide damage and huge losses were inflicted on sugar cane, fruit and vegetable crops. The death toll in Queensland was seven including five on a yacht which sank. There were 26 who died in Papua New Guinea which was also severely affected. Total estimated costs in Australia were $190 million (1997 values).
Severe Tropical Cyclone Rhonda.
This stormed formed in the southern Indian Ocean on 10 May 1997. It dissipated on 16 May. [http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/seasonsummary199697.shtml]
Other storms.
On October 15, TCWC Perth reported that a tropical low developed within a near equatorial trough of low pressure about x, to the southwest of X on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Over the next few days, the low moved into the South-West Indian Ocean basin while developing further, before being named Antoinette by RSMC La Reunion during October 18.

Göta kanal eller Vem drog ur proppen?

Göta kanal eller Vem drog ur proppen? () is a 1981 Swedish comedy film directed by Hans Iveberg and starring Janne 'Loffe' Carlsson and Kim Anderzon.
Plot summary.
A rich Arab wants to place a huge order of 1000 motorboats. The multinational "Uniship" and the smaller company "Anderssons båtvarv" compete for the contract. When the buyer can't reach a decision he wants the boats to compete in a race from Stockholm, through Göta kanal, to Göteborg. The winner of the race will win the contract. The competitors are ready to win at all cost.
Production.
Filming took place between 13 July - 30 September 1981.
The two boats in the film are Orrskär "1000" (Carina) and Storebro's "Storö 31 Baltic" (Uniship).
A documentary, "Hur dom drog ur proppen", was made about the, by Swedish means, advanced stunts.
Reception.
The film was a huge success in Sweden and was seen by over 1.5 million people. A sequel was made, and a second sequel is planned to be released Christmas 2009.
The audience criticized the film for the sound. The film's screen writer and director Hans Iveberg answered in "Expressen" by blaming the tradition in Swedish film making where sound almost resembles that of radio theatre.
In 1983 an article in "Eskilstuna-Kuriren" reported about a conference where the use of product placement in the film was an issue. There was discussions on whether the film should be taxed for this. Iveberg denied being sponsored but Urban Jäfvert and Per Håkansson at University of Stockholm had confirmed that products were exposed in the film in exchange for the crew using them.

WLRI-LP

WLRI-LP (92.9 FM) is a low-power FM radio station licensed to serve Gap, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by LanChester Radio Information, Inc., and the broadcast license is held by Octave Communications Association. It airs classic hits programming.
Having been assigned more than 20 sets of call letters in its short history, the station was most recently assigned the WLRI-LP call sign on December 8, 2008.
Station history.
WLRI-LP was founded June 15, 2001, when County Line Broadcast Group applied for an LPFM construction permit. On April 2, 2002, CLBG reorganized to Octave Communications Association. On October 16, 2003 Octave Communications Association was granted a construction permit from the FCC. On December 29, 2003 WOMB-LP signed on the air at half power. On January 1, 2004, "B93" WOMB-LP launched. The studios were based on Christiana Avenue in Gap. The building at Christiana Avenue was put on the market and forced WLRI-LP to move. In April 2008 WLRI-LP was relocated to Pequea Avenue in downtown Gap. Then again in July, after 3 months on Pequea Avenue, the station's landlord was faced with financial troubles so WLRI-LP was forced to move again.
During its first 4 years WOMB-LP struggled to get notoriety so it covered a generous array of formats and call signs which included: WCGP-LP, "GAP Christiana Parkesburg", WLBX-LP "LanChester's BOX FM" "WOCT-LP - Octave Radio" "WLDW-LP - We're LanChester's Daily World", in 2005 Octorara Communications Association was formed "WOBS-LP - We're the Octorara Broadcasting Service", then reverted to its original concept of WOMB-LP. In 2007 WOMB-LP became WLAL-LP as a way of saying "We Love All of LanChester". Finally WLRI-LP was born, "We're LanChester Radio Independence". WLRI-LP is the first LPFM station to offer RDS radio text service, SCA audio, 5 webcast stations, tested HD Radio, and is the closest LPFM station to Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore.
In recent years the station was branded with slogans like, "You can rely on WLRI 93FM", "LanChester's Favorite", "LanChester's News Leader" and most recently "Music Radio" and "LanChester's Very Own". The station is governed by a board of directors composed of members of the general public. Every reporter, DJ, staff member, and anchor works at their own pace on their own time. The work done or live broadcasts are streamed into the station manager's home where they're broadcast via the internet to the transmitter site. The entire concept of the station is portability, mobility, and accessibility. In addition to local programming, news, weather and traffic, WLRI-LP also airs programs from across the United States from independent sources. In the Fall of 2007 WLRI launched WLRI93FM.com. The station then rebranded the website because the station was facing major encroachment from WDSD in Smyrna, Delaware and WMGS in Scranton, Pennsylvania, So WLRI-LP put itself in a position of neutrality by just labeling and advertising WLRI-LP, no frequency. In 2007 FCC rulemakings changed the second and third protections which removed the encroachment worries placed upon WLRI-LP. In September 2008 WLRI-LP launched MYWLRI.com.
On September 1, 2009, WLRI-LP announced that the station would continue to operate non-broadcast services during the "silent" period. Operating off-air, WLRI-LP continued to offer internet-based programming and services. The station had announced it would resume operation on or before November 1, 2009 as an oldies music format community radio station.
On December 29, 2009, WLRI-LP launched "WLRI 93FM NewsRadio", the first and only LPFM station to offer a 24/7 "All-News" format. Also the only FM station in Lancaster County to host all-news. In March 2010, WLRI-LP moved the "Newsradio" side to HD2. WLRI-LP's current format is a combination of news/talk, classic Hits, adult contemporary with a "hot AC" lean, and adult hits.
In the fall of 2009 WLRI-LP began reading the "Intelligencer Journal/Lancaster New Era" city newspaper over the air as a public service to the visually impaired and those who suffer from illiteracy. In the summer of 2010 WLRI picked up the weekly reading of "Sunday News", the Sunday newspaper from Lancaster Newspapers, Inc. The daily paper is a 30-60 minute read while the Sunday paper is a 2-3 hour read.
In January 2011, WLRI 93FM General Manager, Christian McLaughlin announced that WLRI 93FM would bring back the sound of what radio was in the '70s, '80s and early '90s. By adapting the music format from adult hits, news/talk and by replacing them with classic hits and just reporting news every hour (every half hour in the mornings and on weekends). By engaging with local media professionals who have played a large part in the Lancaster/Philadelphia marketplace(s) WLRI 93FM set out to bring some of the more successful practices performed at stations like WLAN in Lancaster and WCOJ in West Chester. Additionally, WFIL "Famous 56", "Hot Hits 98 WCAU FM", "Eagle 106, WEGX-FM", "94WYSP", "Y-100" WPLY-FM and WMGK "Magic 103" in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The imaging and sound of WLRI 93FM's "classic hits" format derive from the legends themselves, such as: "77WABC" New York, "89WLS" Chicago,"84WHAS" Louisville, "Z-100" WHTZ-FM New York, "66WNBC" New York, "93KHJ" Los Angeles, "97WYNY" New York, "102.7 KIIS-FM" Los Angeles and "DC101" WWDC-FM Washington D.C.. 
WLRI 93FM currently streams live, 24 hours a day via UStream. When the stream is not operating live, previously broadcast will play in place of the downed stream. MyWLRI.com has also had a revision. WLRI 93FM also expanded social outreach by adding many of the internal departments to Facebook and Twitter. [http://facebook.com/wlri93fm] 
WLRI 93FM is a full service, Low Powered FM station based in Gap, Pennsylvania and is currently licensed and silent. WLRI-LP management received a letter from the Federal Communications Commission dated 01/27/2011 which requires WLRI-LP to sign on by the end of November 2011. As of 01/29/2011 station management plans to resume operations (go back on the air) when financial support can be gained, and as soon as weather permits much needed work to the tower facilities to be completed. WLRI 93FM has acquired local disc jockeys to join in on the relaunch. WLRI 93FM has invested thousands in community outreach, promotion, marketing and production of the latest relaunch. As of December 2010, WLRI-LP's live web stream reached a record cume of 1,932,847 listeners. MyWLRI.com recorded over 2 Million unique hits.
On July 12, 2013 WLRI-LP switched format to "All News".
Network Affiliations.
01/01/2010 Local Radio Information (LRI) signed on as the first, free LPFM and Micropower broadcast radio network for non-commercial use and low power use nationwide.
10/01/2010 WLRI 93FM officially became the first and only Pacifica Radio Network station in Southeastern Pennsylvania.

Slash-and-char

Slash-and-char is an alternative to slash-and-burn that has a lesser effect on the environment. It is the practice of charring the biomass resulting from the slashing, instead of burning it as in the slash-and-burn practice. The resulting residue matter charcoal and biochar improves the soil.
In that context, charcoal can be made by numerous and varied methods, from the simplest (an earth cover on the pile of wood, with strategically placed vents) to the most sophisticated (a modern plant that recuperates and recycles strictly all exhaust gases). (See also: biomass, explaining some of these methods and advantages.)
Slash-and-char offers considerable benefits to the environment when compared to slash-and-burn.
It results in the creation of biochar, which can then be mixed with biomass such as crop residues, food waste, manure and / or other, and buried in the soil to bring about the formation of terra preta. Terra preta is one of the richest soils on the planet - and the only one known to regenerate itself, although precisely how this happens is hotly debated within the scientific community. 
It moreover sequesters considerable quantities of carbon in the safest and most beneficial fashion, as opposite to the negative effects of the slash-and-burn. Switching to slash-and-char can sequester up to 50% of the carbon in a highly stable form.
The nascent carbon trading market that sponsors sequestration projects, could therefore help supplement the farmers' income while supporting a decrease in the pace of deforestation and the development of a more sustainable agriculture.

George Goodwin Kilburne

George Goodwin Kilburne, R.I., R.O.I, R.M.S, (24 July 1839 – 1924 London) was an English genre painter specialising in accurately drawn interiors with figures. He favoured the watercolour medium, although he also worked in oils, pencil and - in his early career - engraving.
Life.
George was born at Hackford near Reepham in Norfolk, the eldest of the three children of Goodwin Kilburne (1812–1887) and Rebeccca Button (1801–1880).
Kilburne was educated at Hawkhurst, Kent - his father's old school. On leaving at the age of 15, he went to London to serve a 5-year apprenticeship as a wood engraver with the Dalziel brothers, engravers and illustrators. He was highly regarded by his employers who described him as "industrious and constant" and "one of the most satisfactory pupils we ever had". His time as an engraver served him well, allowing him to develop the accuracy and detail which would enhance his subsequent painting. He remained with the firm for a further year before leaving to take up watercolour and oil painting as a profession, quickly becoming one of the most sought after and well-known artists in England.
In June 1862, Kilburne married Janet Dalziel at Old Church, St. Pancras, London. She was the daughter of Robert Dalziel, the painter and brother of the Dalziel brothers. They had three sons and two daughters - of these his eldest son, George Goodwin Kilburne Jnr., became a very well known painter of animals and figures, principally of sporting subjects. In 1881 the family were recorded as living in Hampstead, London. 
Janet died in 1882. In 1889 Kilburne married Edith Golightly (34 years his junior) and a further two children ensued - Edith May (Born 1900) and Constance Ivy (born 1902).
Kilburne was a keen sportsman and equestrian and involved himself in hunting, cycling and golf. He possessed a good collection of arms and armour, mainly swords, which often figured in his pictures. He was said to be very quiet and almost retiring in manner, yet very companionable and a friendly and a genial host.
He lived for many years at Hawkhurst House, 39 Steeles Road, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead in London and was a member of the Artists' Society Club at Langham Chambers. At the time of his death, in 1924, he was living at 16, Albion Road, Swiss Cottage, London, but died at his daughter Florence's home, next door to his old house, 38 Steeles Road, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, London.
Work.
George's paintings often portrayed the upper classes and ultra-fashionable female beauties in opulent late 18th and early 19th-century settings. His depiction of this beauty was heightened by his attention to detail with dress, and richly decorated interiors. During the period his paintings would have been considered traditional, especially compared to the work of contemporaries such as James McNeill Whistler and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.
Kilburne travelled extensively in Italy around 1875, and painted in Rome for three months, besides working in Venice at that time, and also in 1876. He did a great deal of sketching in Normandy and Switzerland, besides visiting many parts of England and Wales for the same purpose.
Shortly after the death of the Emperor Napoleon III, the Empress Eugenie commissioned KIlburne to paint several pictures for her. For this purpose he paid many visits to her at Chislehurst, Kent to paint pictures of the rooms used by the late Emperor, which had been kept, just as they were, during his lifetime.
Towards the end of the nineteenth century, he designed and executed a great number of greetings and Christmas cards for the firm of Raphael Tuck & Sons and De La Rue, the minute labour and work for which brought on a serious attack of gout in the eyes. He also contributed a large number of black and white pictures to The Graphic, The Illustrated London News and Cassell's Magazine. Many of his pictures became popular through prints.
Kilburne was elected a member of the New Watercolour Society (RI) in 1866. He became a member of the Royal Miniature Society in 1898 and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters (ROI) in 1883. In London, Kilburne exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1863–1918, at the Royal Society of British Artists (Suffolk Street), New Watercolour Society, Royal Miniature Society, Grosvenor Gallery, Dowdeswell Galleries and others. In the regions he exhibited at Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, the Manchester City Art Gallery, the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. 
Kilburne's work can be seen nowadays in many public and private galleries including the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, Manchester City Art Gallery and the Sheffield Art Gallery.

Obituary 1.
George Goodwin Kilburne, R.I.
The funeral of Mr. G. G. Kilburne, R.I., took place at the old Highgate Cemetery on Thursday, 26 June, the service being conducted by the Rev. Dr. Hackett, of St. Peter's, Belsize-square. Amongst those present were the widow; Mr. Wm. Kilburne and wife; Mr. Chas. Kilburne and wife; Mr. and Mrs. R. A. Walton and their son and daughter; Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Woakes and their son-in-law and daughter (Mr. and Mrs. Metzler), and the artist's two youngest daughters; Messrs. Gilbert, Charles & Wilfred Dalziel; H. C. B. Wilson; Mr. Heely Smith, of the Artists' Society, Langham Chambers; W. Blackmore, of the Royal Institute of Painters and Sheridon Knowles of the Institute; Val. Davis, of the Langham Sketching Club; Thomas McLean; A. E. Gosling, and Mr. Hassell. The absence of the deceased's sister and eldest son was due to the failing health of the former, the latter being in California at present. The floral tributes were of exceptional number and beauty, and were contributed from many friends in addition to the family, from the several Societies of which deceased had been a member, and others.
By the death, in his 85th year, of George Kilburne, R.I., which took place on the 2lst ult. at 38 Steele's-road, the residence of his eldest daughter, Mrs. Robert Walton, there disappears the last of a little brotherhood of artists, who, from the "Sixties " and "Seventies" onward, were known and esteemed as the Haverstock Hill men.
In Steele's-road alone, in houses almost adjacent, there lived and worked, for many years, Fred Barnard, Sir James D. Linton, Edwin Hayes, and George Kilburne. In Upper Park-road, and later on in Hampstead Hill-gardens, were the brothers Charles and. Towneley Green. Robert Macbeth, R.A., had a studio in England's-lane; G. J. Pinwell lived in Adelaide-road; and A. B. Houghton in King Henry's-road. Sir Luke Fildes, R.A., and Henry Woods, R.A., were at 22 King Henry's-road for many years; and in the neighbourhood were to be found E. F. Brewtnall and many others. All these men have now gone to their rest, with the exception of Sir Luke Fildes, who long since migrated from Hampstead to Kensington. The members of this artistic fraternity were gifted and hardworking men. They, likewise, possessed that little touch of Bohemianism, so prevalent in those bygone days, and which added charm to their personality and helped to produce an atmosphere of genuine hospitality in their homes and studios.
George Goodwin Kilburne was born in Norfolk on 24 July 1839, and was the eldest son of the late Goodwin Kilburne, of Hawkhurst, Kent. On leaving school George was apprenticed for five years to the Brothers Daiziel, the famous wood-engravers. He worked at wood-engraving for one year after serving his time, and then gave it up entirely, devoting himself to painting. In 1862 he married Janet, a niece of the Brothers Dälziel and a daughter of the late Robert Dalziel, a portrait painter of considerable ability, who died as quite a young man. George Kilburne's work, whether in water-colour or oil, was distinctly accomplished, and he possessed the happy knack of hitting upon fascinating subjects for his pictures. His art was popular with the picture-buying public and also with the dealers. For more than sixty years he had no difficulty in selling his things, and he worked with unabated interest and enthusiasm up to the time when his health showed sign of giving way - now a year or two back. In the more robust days he took a particular interest in riding and hunting, and in his collection of ancient arms and armour, of which he was justly proud.
Of his personal character no one who really knew him could ever say a word against him. He was much beloved by his family, his relatives, and his friends, Quiet and reserved by nature, and often somewhat silent, one knew that in spite of these characteristics there was beneath them a true and sincere man. Modest to a degree concerning his own work, he was always ready to see and praise the good qualities in others. He never spoke unkindly of anyone; nor during his long life did he harbour an unfriendly thought even towards those whose code of honour was not as his.
In brilliant sunshine we laid him to rest by the side of his first wife, Janet, in old Highgate Cemetery; and as we left him we felt we were bidding farewell to one whose good name would long endure.
Obituary 2.
MR. G. G. KILBURNE
With the death of George Goodwin Kilburne, R.I., at the age of eighty-five, the art world loses well-nigh the last of a distinguished group of water-colour artists whose work enriched the latter part of the nineteenth Century.
Born in Norfolk on 24 July 1839, George Kilburne was the son of Goodwin Kilburne, of Hawkhurst, Kent, a noted science scholar and founder of the Hawkhurst Grammar School, where his artist son was educated, and spent his youth, coming to London when about fifteen years of age. Apprenticed to the Daiziel Brothers, wood engravers, for five years, George Kilburne learned and practised with some distinction the now almost obsolete art of wood engraving. That he relinquished to cultivate his exceptional talent as a painter, with the result that within nine years he was elected (1868) an Associate of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours, out of which grew the present Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. Of this body Kilburne remained a prominent member.
In 1872 he married the daughter of Robert Daiziel and niece of the Brothers Daiziel. Visiting Italy in 1875 and 1876, he found there inspiration for many of his paintings, in particular for those illustrating the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries-works that will continue to be valued as truthful records of the dress and customs of the periods to which they relate, apart from their intrinsic merits as works of art. Kilburne's finest work dates from about this time, and its range was wide enough to cover interiors, landscape, figure pieces, and some notable portraits.
After the death of Napoleon III. the Empress Eugénie commissioned him to paint several pictures of the rooms lately occupied by the Emperor at Chislehurst, and with this work she was highly gratified. His wife died in 1882, leaving him with five children, who are still living, the eldest son being an artist devoted to coaching and sporting subjects. George Kilburne himself was a keen sportsman and equestrian as far as his residence in London permitted. Towards the end of the last century he designed and executed a great number of the most charming Christmas and other cards for the firms of Raphael Tuck and Sons and de Ia Rue, the minute labour and work for these bringing on a serious attack of gout in the eyes. This section of his work would of itself provide material for an exhibition. "Pears' Annual" also for several years contained specimens of his best work.
Very quiet and almost retiring in manner Kilburne was yet very companionable, and had a large circle of friends. He was a diligent collector and connoisseur of arms and armour and of the rapier and sword he had at one time an extremely fine collection.
For over fifty years he had been the honorary treasurer of the Artists' Society, and he was an assiduous member of the Langham Sketching Club and Life School. He had outlived most of his contemporaries, amongst whom may be mentioned Sir James Linton, S. Prout, Charles Cattermole, Charles Green, Townley Green, Fred Barnard, Thomas Pyne, Edwin Hayes, Tom Blinks, Pinwell, Walker, Davidson, and Yeend King.

Papal conclave, 1378

The papal conclave from April 7 to 9, 1378 was the papal conclave which was the immediate cause of the Western Schism in the Catholic Church. The conclave was one of the shortest in the history of the Catholic Church. The conclave was also the first held in the Vatican and in Old St. Peter's Basilica (the elections and conclaves in Rome prior to the Avignon Papacy having been held mostly in the Basilica of St. John Lateran) since 1159.
Pope Gregory XI died on March 26, 1378 in Rome, having returned from Avignon to pursue his territorial interests in the Papal States during the War of the Eight Saints. Although the French cardinals constituted a majority of the College of Cardinals due to the preceding Avignon Papacy, they succumbed to the will of the Roman mob, which demanded the election of an Italian pontiff. They elected Bartolommeo Prignano, who took the name Pope Urban VI. This was the last time a non-cardinal was elected pope.
Proceedings.
Before his death, Gregory XI substantially loosened the laws of the conclave: he instructed the cardinals to begin immediately after his death (rather than waiting the nine days prescribed by the "Ordo Romanis") to prevent "factional coercion", he gave the cardinals permission to hold the conclave outside of Rome and move it as many times as necessary, and also seemingly suspended the two-thirds requirement, replacing it with "the greater part" (an ambiguous statement, in the original).
The cardinals were divided into three factions: the first constituting the four Italian cardinals (two Romans, one Florentine, and one Milanese), the second constituting the seven "Limoges" cardinals (referred to individually as "Limousins"), and the third constituting the five remaining French cardinals. The conclave was delayed one day because of a violent storm, and thereafter the seven Limoges cardinals wishing to leave Rome as Gregory XI had authorized them to were persuaded by the others that such an act would place the College in even more danger. It was midnight on the second day before the servants of the cardinals succeeded in clearing the Old Basilica of those not permitted to remain in the conclave.
According to the "Catholic Encyclopedia", even Robert of Geneva (future Antipope Clement VII) and Pedro Martínez de Luna y Gotor (future Antipope Benedict XIII)—the two claimants of the Avignon line during the ensuing Schsim—were among those who voted for Prignano. Prignano had previously lived in France, which may have softened the blow of his election to many of his French electors. The selection was supposedly "unanimous", with the exception of Giacomo Orsini, who claimed that he was not "free" enough to vote.
Prignano was accompanied by several other prelates (to conceal the identity of the selected candidate) to the Vatican to accept his election. To further the confusion, Orsini gave the "Habemus Papam" without identifying Prignano.
Upon the conclusion of the election, the Roman mob entered the site of the conclave, under the impression that an aged Roman cardinal Tebaldeschi (who had been left in possession of the papal insignia) had been elected, an impression that the remaining cardinals did not disabuse them of as they fled to their personal quarters. The remaining cardinal informed the crowd of the election of Prignano who was hiding in the "most secret room" until his election could be announced.
Cardinal electors.
Sixteen of the twenty-three active cardinals took part in the conclave. Two possible other cardinals—Piero Tornaquinci and Pietro Tartaro—were not accepted into the ranks of the College for the election. Six more cardinals remained in Avignon, and Jean de la Grange was absent as well.
Aftermath.
The following September, the French cardinals reunited in Avignon, moved to Fondi, and elected Antipope Clement VII, who gained the support of all thirteen of his electors (at the time the entire College numbered twenty-two due to the death of Francesco Tebaldeschi).
Sources.
Inquisitor Nicholas Eymerich witnesses the conclave, and then went on to write one of the first tracts against Urban VI, "Tractatus de potestate papali" (1383), which argued in favor of the legitimacy of the Avignon line of papal claimants. Several other eye-witnesses record the chant of the Roman crowd: "We want a Roman or at least an Italian" (). The contemporary curial document "Factum Urbani" attests to the general atmosphere of confusion, fear, and panic. For example, canonist Gilles Bellemère recounts removing his clerical garb for fear of the mob and the constant ringing of bells.
Pro-Urban sources—such as Alfonso de Jaén, the confessor of Bridget of Sweden, her daughter Catharine, and Dietrich of Nieheim—claim that the situation in Rome was less restless. The marked discrepancy between the classes of sources can be explained by the fact that the alleged duress of the mob became the primary argument in favor of the legitimacy of the Avignon claimants.

World Watch

World Watch is a program on SBS One and SBS Two in Australia that carries news bulletins from countries around the world. The World Watch service gives viewers the opportunity to see news bulletins in their native language. The majority of these bulletins are produced by public or state broadcasters.
History.
The WorldWatch program began in August 1993 with news bulletins from People's Republic of China, United States, Republic of China, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Republic of China and Russia.
In June 2002, SBS launched the SBS World News Channel, providing repeats of aired bulletins on SBS in addition to updated bulletins.
In October 2003, Filipino, Vietnamese and Arabic were added to the World Watch schedule. However, the Vietnamese service was controversial as the broadcaster chosen was the government-controlled VTV4, and was seen as deeply offensive and seen as propaganda to many Vietnamese-Australians who fled after the Vietnam War. It was quickly removed on 17 October.
The resulting backlash on the decision to air the program has seen SBS air disclaimers on all of its World Watch programs that distance the broadcaster from the editorial content of each bulletin.
In 2009, SBS replaced the World News Channel with SBS Two, and the bulletins also moved to the new channel under the "World Watch" banner. Bulletins air from 6am to 6pm, whereas SBS One airs the bulletins between 5am and 1:30pm.
In 2010, SBS added three new languages: Portuguese, Urdu and Hindi.
News Bulletins.
In determining the World Watch schedule, the policy of SBS has been to match the selection of news programs with the ethnic composition of the Australian population. The World Watch schedule includes news bulletins from China, Chile, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malta, Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Spain, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, and the United States.
The programs are usually broadcast unedited. However, SBS does edit programs under "exceptional circumstances" where it breaches broadcasting regulations and its Codes of Practices. In addition, commercials and sponsorship messages are edited out, while the end of the program will also be cut out when the program runs overtime in its timeslot.
If SBS does not receive the program on time, it will replace the program with its Weatherwatch program.

Leykina Island

Leykina Island (Russian: Ostrov Leykina), formerly Ostrov Osushnoy, is an island in the Laptev Sea. It is located off the Olenyok Gulf, roughly midway between Peschanyy Island and the Dunay Islands.
Although Leykina Island appears in Russian maps (Russian Hydrographic Office chart no 11142), it is not listed in the British Admiralty sailing directions. The Admiralty pilot describes the charted location of the island as ‘doubtful’. 
A British yachtsman visiting the area recently failed to find Leykina Island, being able to discern only: ""...A ring of small breakers clearly demarcated what I took to be the 5-metre contour line as the seabed shoaled towards where the island should be.""
Leykina might be an island of the Russian Arctic that has eroded away and disappeared in recent times, like Semyonovsky, Figurina, Vasilievsky and Merkuriya.
Administration.
For administrative purposes Leykina Island belongs to the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic of the Russian Federation.

Virtual lab automation

Virtual Lab Automation refers to a category of software solutions to automate IT labs using virtualization technology. Virtual Lab Automation (VLA) solutions are available as on-premise packaged software or as a cloud service.
History.
Akimbi pioneered the Virtual Lab Management market with its Slingshot product. VMware acquired Akimbi in 2006. VMLogix LabManager was launched in 2006 as well; followed by a virtual lab solution on the Amazon public cloud in 2009. CloudShare (originally named IT Structures) and Skytap introduced the first cloud-based virtual lab automation services in 2008.
voke research describes the evolution of virtual automation as follows. The first generation of solutions focused on Virtual Lab Management (VLM) only. The second generation expanded to the cloud. The third generation, lifecycle virtualization, covers VLM, virtual cloud platforms, service virtualization, defect virtualization, and device virtualization.
Solutions.
Virtual labs are used for sales, testing, demos, training, development and certification of software and hardware solutions. The main potential business benefits are reduced labor and hardware costs,faster response times to customers and channels, improved testing reliability and simple access to complex configurations.
Virtual lab management software is used in educational institutes and universities as well in orchestrating virtual training labs and in education IT. VMLogix is offering their management solutions at no cost to Universities worldwide.
Capabilities.
A virtual lab automation solution typically includes the following capabilities:
Resource Pooling and Provisioning.
Resource pooling enables processing power, storage and networking infrastructure to be shared between different teams and individuals, increasing utilization and availability of resources, and reducing costs. In conjunction with resource pooling, an orchestration and provisioning process allocates and releases resources as needed.
Complex Multi-Machine Configurations.
Virtual labs are usually targeted to complex enterprise scenarios and support complex networking topologies such as multiple networks, bridging, routing and multi-tier apps.
Some solutions enable integration of virtual machines, physical machines, network appliances and hypervisors to reflect current enterprise setups.
Virtual machine images are the containers that enable operating systems and applications to be isolated from physical resources. A group of virtual or physical images or that define a complete system, including network and storage characteristics, is defined as a configuration. For instance, a configuration could consist of multiple Windows Vista client machines, an Oracle database server and a WebSphere application server. Configurations can be easily created by combining machines through a user interface. A configuration is a very useful concept for QA teams because it allows a whole system to be defined and isolated in a test environment. Virtual networking enables copies of the same environment to be run in parallel and the emulation of production environments during the test process.
Configuration Library.
A configuration library allows a team to manage and organize virtual images and configurations. Standard builds and images can be created and made available to development and QA teams to save hours of set-up time and environment configuration. Additionally, the library is used to store new configurations that are cloned or created as part of a test.
Life cycle Management.
The ability to suspend a complete state of a multi-machine configuration and make a snapshot (a copy at a point in time) is a major benefit of virtualization. This is especially useful for application development teams because when a bug is found a configuration snapshot to be taken at the point of failure and a link to the configuration added to a defect report. Instead of a developer spending hours to reproduce the defect, he or she can restore the configuration and start debugging the issue within minutes.
The ability to control the life cycle automatically is beneficial for web based service. For example, an environment can run for two hours and than automatically be archived to disk.this reduces the costs of running the environments and allows for multiple business scenarios.
Scheduling and Reservations.
Many in-house virtual lab implementations have a fixed pool of resources for teams to share. Scheduling and reservation functionality allows the resolution of resource conflicts and test environments to be reserved ahead of time.
Reporting and Monitoring.
Reporting modules allow users and administrators to manage usage and quotas and determine whether the system resources are being used optimally. Monitoring enables the system health to be diagnosed, including CPU utilization, storage performance and network usage.
Automation API.
Automating a test lab almost always involves integrating tools and test processes. An automation API enables teams to automatically create test environments as part of the build process and initiate automated test runs once a new build has been deployed. An automation API is typically made available through a web services interface.
Some products like VMLogix LabManager and Citrix LabManager has inbuilt automation capabilities which would provide out of the automation inside the VMs. In such cases, you don't need to write scripts to call these automation APIs as it can be easily done through the GUI.
Security.
Security features include access and roles management, permissions and authentication. Some services allow dynamic roles assignment (for example, vendor and channel) or hierarchy (manager and employee). Since replicated guests have identical user names and passwords, those need customization for public services.
Remote Access and Visualization.
Remote access to the system (for instance for an outsourced vendor) is usually managed through secure connections via encrypted protocols and virtual private networking.
Access to identical copies of configurations over the internet requires a method to authenticate traffic at the application level while guarantees it is tunneled only to the relevant environment.
Typically the lab environments are visualized over the web to demonstrated the multi-server topologies and logical relationship.
Administration.
Administration features often include project creation, quota management, billing, auditing and customization.
Vendors.
Virtual lab automation solutions are available as on-premise packaged software or as a cloud service. VMware, Surgient and VMLogix launched in 2006 to provide packaged software solutions. IT Structures and Skytap launched in 2008. and offer virtual lab automation as a cloud service. VMBed is another cloud-based service.
Microsoft provides virtualization capabilities through its Hyper-V technology.

Scott v Shepherd

Scott v. Shepherd 96 Eng. Rep. 525 (K.B. 1773), commonly known as "The famous Squib Case," is an important English tort law case on remoteness and the principle of "novus actus interveniens" as it related to the division between trespass and case.
Facts.
Shepherd tossed a lit squib into a crowded market in the town of Milborne Port in Somerset, where it landed on the table of a gingerbread merchant named Yates. Willis, a bystander, grabbed the squib and threw it across the market to protect himself and the gingerbread. Unfortunately, the squib landed in the goods of another merchant named Ryal. Ryal immediately grabbed the squib and tossed it away, accidentally hitting Scott in the face just as the squib exploded. The explosion put out one of Scott's eyes.
Judgment.
The majority held Shepherd was fully liable, because, said De Gray CJ, "I do not consider intermediaries as free agents in the present case, but acting under a compulsive necessity for their own safety and self-preservation."
Nares J wrote the following.
De Grey CJ's judgment was as follows.
Dissent.
Blackstone J argued, reflecting the arcane distinctions between trespass on the case and vi et armis, that there was no liability for indirect consequences.

Brazilian Canadian

A Brazilian Canadian (Portuguese: Brasileiro Canadense) (French: Brésilien Canadien) is a Canadian of Brazilian descent or a Brazilian who has immigrated to Canada. The 1991 Canadian census reports 2,520 individuals of wholly Brazilian origin and another 2,325 who describe Brazilian as one of their ethnic origins (Brazilians themselves may be of varied European, African, Middle Eastern, East Asian and Amerindian ethnic origins), giving a total of 4,845. This figure can be taken as an official minimum and corresponds to Brazilian consular estimates.
However, in the 1980s and 1990s a large number of younger Brazilians established families in Toronto. The local newspaper "Abacaxi Times" estimated that the total number of Brazilians living in Toronto in the 1990s was about 9,000. Probably an equal number of legal immigrants entered Ontario to that date. The total for Canada was 14,976. When refugee claimants and illegal immigrants are added, the total in Ontario alone may approach 12,000, with a few thousand more in Quebec and British Columbia; there are smaller groups scattered across the country. New immigrants have continued to enter the country, but at a much slower pace than in the previous decade.

Moreton Bay Marine Park

The Moreton Bay Marine Park was established in 1992 to protect ecologically significant habitats in Moreton Bay. The park extends from Caloundra south to the Gold Coast Seaway. The park's border extends up to the highest tidal mark and covers a total of 3400 km2.
The park provides protection to sensitive reef sites near Tangalooma and Flinders Reef. It includes waterways such as Coombabah Lake, mangrove forests, swamps, marshes, tidal mudflats, sandflats and seagrass beds. It is a temporary home to migrating shorebirds that inhabit wetlands. Dugongs, whales and turtles swim in the waters of the bay.
The park is managed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Marine Park Zoning Plan.
From 1 March 2009, activities in the park are designated under the Marine Park Zoning Plan. 16% of the bay is protected in green zones or marine national park zones. This leaves 84% of the park available to anglers.
The Queensland Government has spent AUD2$ million to create three artificial reefs within the marine park. A free user guide is widely available in bait and boat shops in the region as well as online.
Zones.
There are four zones in Moreton Bay Marine Park. These are the Marine national park zone (green) which contain areas of high conservation value, Conservation park zone (yellow) allowing limited fishing and crabbing, Habitat protection (dark blue) zone for sensitive habitats with no trawling allowed and General use zone (light blue) allow activities such as trawling. The zones are patrolled by rangers. Fines of up to A$500 for fishing in the green zone have been issued.
Designated areas.
There are nine types of designated areas in the marine park. These areas have been set aside so that specific issues that occur at specific locations can be properly managed. Examples of designated areas include Go slow areas to protect dugongs and turtles, No anchoring areas to protect sensitive reefs and Grey nurse shark areas designed to conserve the endangered shark species.

Twixters (TV series)

Twixters is an International Multiplatform Comedy Series inspired by the TIME Magazine. The series was created in 2007 by satirist/filmmaker Dan Speerin of the sketch comedy group Cynically Tested to satirize life as a Millennial and to mock the false perceptions of Generation Y. The series was co-produced by fellow Cynically Tested members Alan So and Aravinth Vince Kesavamoorthy. Twixters aired on Bite TV in Canada and Propeller TV in UK. The series also aired on Triangle Stratos in New Zealand. Twixters' success and the stance of its creator on Millennial Life was featured in the Toronto Star. Other media coverage for the series included Sun TV's Canoe Live, G4 Tech TV, and The Eye Weekly Magazine. The show’s indie success is mainly due to its utilization of interactive social platforms as YouTube, Facebook, MySpace and Blogs. Part of their success is based on their rebuttal on YouTube to the piece on Millennials by 60 Minutes on CBS titled Twixters vs 60 Minutes Millennials, and Millennials Fight Back!. The latter video was covered by CBS Interactive’s BNET evoking greater discussion about the fairness of the coverage of the millennial generation by 60 Minutes. An interactive component of Twixters is also available on Not Like Us Productions’ Cynically Tested Channel on MySpace, Facebook and YouTube and can be viewed at www.twixterstv.com
Twixters in Popular Culture.
The TV series and its various multiplatform components continues to be a part of the social lexicon when discussing the millennial generation, as it has been referred to by educational, technological, political, business and marketing platforms as well as university curriculum. Some such examples include Inside Higher ED, Future Majority, Workforce Management’s HR Capitalists, and h+ Magazine. Jerry Pattengale, the founder of Purpose-Guided Education has cited content of the series in his text. Dr. Scott Bryant of Montana State University has also utilized various content of the show as part of his course. As a testament to their success in provoking discussion in the subject matter, Twixters’ creators and producers were invited to be guest panelists and speakers at the Millennials Conference Canada at Canadian Music Week 2008. Speerin and his team continue to be the voice of Generation Y as can be seen from the multi-page Ottawa Citizen print article in 2011.
Follow Up: The What Is!
The producers of Twixters continued their focus on providing a voice to the millennial generation with the creation of The What Is!, a television miniseries that aired on ichannel. A half-hour Federal Election Special, titled The What Is!: Election 2008, focusing on youth voter issues pertaining to the federal election, made its debut on October 11. This special also doubled as the pilot episode for the series. The co-creator, writer and host of The What Is!, Dan Speerin, has teamed with his producing partners from Twixters, Alan So and Vince Kesavamoorthy, to produce the series under their production company Not Like Us Productions. Guests of the series include Navdeep Bains, Patrick Sullivan (then-President of Workopolis), and Jack Layton & Olivia Chow. An interactive component of this series is also available on Not Like Us Productions’ Cynically Tested Channel on MySpace, Facebook and YouTube and can be viewed at www.twixterstv.com. The show has been featured in various forms of media including The Toronto Sun, The Globe and Mail, Eye Weekly Magazine and Macleans on Campus. As a testament to the success of the series, The What Is! won a Television and Cable Productions Gold Remi award under the category Political Commentary at the 42nd Annual WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival. Others honored in this category included the Norddeutscher Rundfunk documentary Henry Kissinger – Secrets of a Superpower. The series won its second Gold Remi in the same category the following year at the 43rd Annual WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival.
Dan Speerin's Truth Mashup.
Following the success of their half-hour satire, Cynically Tested's Truth From Here on CBC Television, Not Like Us Productions debuted a new HD television series titled Dan Speerin's Truth Mashup on Rogers TV Toronto (channel 10 & 63, HD channel 510) on October 6, 2010. The series is created and produced by Dan Speerin, Alan So and Vince Kesavamoorthy. Speerin is also the host of the series. Each episode of Dan Speerin’s Truth Mashup features sketches from Cynically Tested Channel, musical performances by some of Canada’s up and coming musical talent, roundtable discussions with Toronto’s top young comedians and journalists (filmed at The Cadillac Lounge), as well as one-on-one interviews with some of the most interesting and successful Canadians (filmed at The Toronto Underground Cinema). The show addresses topics such as the legitimacy of online media, the state of Canadian film and television industry, Canadian culture versus American culture, advertising and its permeation of the social fabric, as well as the 2010 Toronto mayoral elections. The series featured one-one-one interviews with Colin Mochrie, Geoff Lapaire and Jarett Cale (the creators of the popular online series turned Showcase television series Pure Pwnage), mayoral candidates of Toronto's Mayor Elections 2010 George Smitherman and Joe Pantalone, Jennifer Hollett of CBC’s Connect with Mark Kelley, Journalist with the Real News Network Jesse Freeston, artists and activists Posterchild and Sean Martindale, as well as then-Mayor of Toronto David Miller. Musical guests of the show included Hooded Fang and Anna Cyzon.
Truth Mashup’s coverage of the launch of Sun News Network and said network’s right wing bias was covered by various media including The Grid Magazine (Toronto) and The Georgia Straight (Vancouver), TV-eh podcast and CIUT’s Vibe Collective. The 2011 Federal Election was the first Canadian Federal Election since the social media boom. Truth Mashup’s Dan Speerin is known as a social media savvy satirist. Speerin was consulted by many in the media including CBC’s Connect with Mark Kelley and TVO’s The Agenda with Steve Palkin. Speerin’s humorous yet astute take on the role of social media in this federal elections appeared on CTV.ca. Truth Mashup’s various response videos to the ethnic voter targeted political ad campaigns was featured in The Torontoist and was ranked as the top response by Vancouver’s popular multicultural magazine Schema. Truth Mashup was also invited media guests at the NDP National Convention during the night of the elections.
Despite its limited reach on the television platform, Dan Speerin’s Truth Mashup continues to garner a national audience through its various online social platforms. This is rendered visible by the media coverage the show has received by various media outlets across Canada, and the interview, panel and musical guests the show has been able to attract.

Douen

The Douen is a character from Trinidad and Tobago folklore, it is believed they are the lost souls of children that had not yet been baptized or christened. Their most recognized characteristic are their feet that are said to be backwards, with the heel facing the front.
The Folklore.
Douen (pronounced Dwen) are considered to be the ‘lost souls’ of children that were not baptized or christened before death. It is said that they are destined to wander the earth eternally while practicing their collection of pranks. Neither male nor female, douens live in the forest, swamps and near rivers in Trinidad and Tobago. Their manifestation is that of a naked child never growing more than two or three feet in height. They wear a large floppy straw hat and have an entirely undistinguished face with the exception of a small mouth. The one characteristic that allows them to be recognized as douens are their feet, which are turned backwards with the heel facing forward. Douens roam the land in the pursuit of children that are not yet baptized, or christened in anticipation of luring them away deep into the woods until they are lost. They charm the children when the moon is full and have a mesmerizing whooping sound. A child who plays with a douen may consider it to be a regular child while the douen slowly but surely leads the child further and further away from the protection of home. Some children may be found the next morning in a precarious arrangement if they are found at all. Douens also have been known to come to people’s houses crying and whimpering for the love of a mother. They feed off cultivated gardens and seem to have a bizarre fondness for water crabs. Often thought to be evil spirits and malevolent creatures, douens do have a good natured side. They have been known to be of assistance to Papa Bois in the forest when an animal is trapped and injured by imitating animal calls to throw hunters off track. To avert the douens from calling your children into the forest it is said that you should never call a child’s name in open places for the douens will then in turn call the child’s name to attract them away into the forest never to return. There have been actual reports of douen encounters from children in rural areas of Trinidad such as Piparo, Penal and Barrakpore. These spirits have been reported to manifest themselves in the homes of people who have been talking about either the Douen or similar creatures. Reports suggest that open talk summons the creatures or creates a positive pull towards those who look for them. Manifestation in one's home could either be by seeing images of a child or by childish-seeming "pranks" being played on individuals. These creatures once called upon, can be very tricky to get rid of as they tend to be very clingy like real children would be. Natives report that religious intervention is typically called upon to remove the creatures from one's home.
Origins of Folklore in Trinidad and Tobago.
Trinidad and Tobago folklore is primarily of African foundation, with French, Spanish and English influences. Religious or semi-religious cults of African origin have undeniably contributed much to the Island's folklore. Many of the supernatural folklore characters are identical with those of African deities. It is exceedingly complicated to draw a line between the stern religious elements and what may be described as traditions. Nevertheless in the African tradition, stories were meant to instill values in the children.
In popular culture.
Douen feature heavily in "Lost and Found", a season 4 episode of the Syfy television show "Haven".

Kayles

In combinatorial game theory, Kayles is a simple impartial game. In the notation of octal games, Kayles is denoted 0.77.
Rules.
Kayles is played with a row of tokens, which represent bowling pins. The row may be of any length. The two players alternate; each player, on his or her turn, may remove either any one pin (a ball bowled directly at that pin), or two adjacent pins (a ball bowled to strike both). Under the normal play convention, a player loses when he or she has no legal move (that is, when all the pins are gone). The game can also be played using misère rules; in this case, the player who cannot move "wins".
Analysis.
Most players quickly discover that the first player has a guaranteed win in normal Kayles whenever the row length is greater than zero. This win can be achieved using a symmetry strategy. On his or her first move, the first player should move so that the row is broken into two sections of equal length. This restricts all future moves to one section or the other. Now, the first player merely imitates the second player's moves in the opposite row.
It is more interesting to ask what the nim-value is of a row of length formula_1. This is often denoted formula_2; it is a nimber, not a number. By the Sprague-Grundy theorem, formula_2 is the mex over all possible moves of the nim-sum of the nim-values of the two resulting sections. For example,
because from a row of length 5, one can move to the positions
Recursive calculation of values (starting with formula_6) gives the results summarized in the following table. To find the value of formula_2 on the table, write formula_1 as formula_9, and look at row a, column b:
At this point, the nim-value sequence becomes periodic with period 12, so all further rows of the table are identical to the last row.
Applications.
Because certain positions in Dots and Boxes reduce to Kayles positions, it is helpful to understand Kayles in order to analyze a generic Dots and Boxes position.
History.
Kayles was invented by Henry Dudeney. Richard Guy and Cedric Smith were first to completely analyze the normal-play version, using Sprague-Grundy theory. The misère version was analyzed by William Sibert in 1973, but he did not publish his work until 1989.
The name "Kayles" is an Anglicization of the French "quilles", meaning "bowling."

Duty to God Award

The Duty to God Award honor is presented to young men who participate in the Aaronic Priesthood training within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The Duty to God program for young men is roughly equivalent to the Personal Progress program for young women in the LDS Church.
Award history.
Prior to 2002, the award was presented to young male LDS Church members in recognition of their fulfillment of religious duties. Although the award did not require participation in the Scouting program of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), the BSA recognized it as evidence of a Scout's commitment to Scouting principles. The concept of the current award was first introduced by F. Melvin Hammond at the church's October 2001 general conference. "Young men who have achieved this new Duty to God Award will be better prepared than ever to go to the temple, serve missions, marry in the temple and become good husbands and fathers,' said Hammond in announcing the program. "They will be better prepared to serve their families, their Church and their community."
Award requirements.
The current award program officially began in January 2002. Aaronic Priesthood candidates qualify for the Duty to God Award after completing specific requirements regarding priesthood duties. These were defined as involvement in family activities, participation in the church’s quorum activities, the successful completion of a Duty to God service project, and reaching personal goals relating to education, spiritual and physical development, and social interactions.
Award name and design.
The award and its qualifying program is named from a passage in the Book of Mormon: "I have said these things unto you that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God" (Alma 7:22). The award, a circular medallion, was designed by Douglas Coy Miles. Before 2002, the award was a buffalo skull-shaped medal designed by Avard Fairbanks.
Controversy.
In the United States, some questions were raised as to whether or not the Duty to God program was created by the LDS Church to replace the focus on the Boy Scout program, especially if Scouting were ever to embrace the changes advocated by gay and atheist activist groups. The LDS Church leadership has stated that the church enjoys a good relationship with the Boy Scouts of America and has no plans to discontinue its use in the activities of the young men organization.

Convoy ON 67

Convoy ON-67 was a trade convoy of merchant ships during the second World War. It was the 67th of the numbered series of ON convoys Outbound from the British Isles to North America. The ships departed from Liverpool on 14 February 1942 with convoy rescue ship "Toward", and were escorted to the Mid-Ocean Meeting Point by escort group B4.
The Escort Group.
On 19 February, the American task unit 4.1.5 assumed escort responsibility with Gleaves class destroyers "Edison" and "Nicholson", Wickes class destroyers "Lea" and "Bernadou" and the Canadian Flower class corvette HMCS "Algoma". "Edison"s commanding officer, Commander Albert C. Murdaugh, USN, was the senior officer of the escort group. The escort group had never operated together before. "Bernadou" had been modified for long range escort work by replacing the fourth boiler and stack with an extra fuel tank. "Toward" carried a HF/DF high-frequency direction finding set, and "Nicholson" had the only functional radar. "Lea" carried a British ASV aircraft radar with fixed antennae, but the coaxial cable to the antennae was repeatedly shorted by salt water spray. "Edison" had no depth charge throwers, and was limited to a linear pattern rolled off the stern. The American ships did not have enough binoculars. "Bernadou" had a 7x50 pair for the officer of the deck and a 6x30 pair for the junior officer of the deck but there were none for the lookouts.
"U-155".
"U-155" found and reported the convoy on 21 February. "Toward" obtained a bearing on the contact report, and "Lea" searched the bearing unsuccessfully at dusk. "U-155" approached the port quarter of the convoy in the pre-dawn hours of 22 February and torpedoed the British tanker "Adellen" and Norwegian freighter "Sama". Both ships sank quickly. "Algoma" rescued eleven of "Adellen"s crew of 31 while "Nicholson" and "Toward" found twenty survivors from "Sama"s crew of forty. "U-155" crash-dived to avoid "Bernadou", but the destroyer never saw the U-boat. "U-155" made another emergency dive while shadowing the convoy at 1042, but "Edison" did not detect the U-boat. "U-587", "U-69", and "U-558" found the convoy on 23 February.
"U-558".
"U-558" approached the convoy at 2120, but repeatedly turned away to avoid "Bernadou"s patrols until a squall provided cover at midnight. "U-558" torpedoed the Norwegian tanker "Inverarder" at 0045 24 February. The tanker sank slowly and "Toward " rescued all 42 of the crew. "U-558" approached again at 0230 and fired a single torpedo at "Edison". The torpedo missed, and "Edison" was unaware it had been fired at. "U-558" torpedoed the Norwegian tanker "Eidanger" at 0255. "U-558" reloaded and at 0550 torpedoed the British tankers "Anadara" and "Finnanger", and the British freighter "White Crest". All three ships straggled and were sunk. Later that morning, the convoy commodore sent a signal to the escort commander regarding the performance of "U-558": "That chap must be one of their best ones. I do hope you have done him in."
U-158.
"U-158" located the convoy at 0425 24 February and torpedoed the British tanker . "Empire Celt" was testing a new Admiralty Net Defense system by streaming a strong steel net from poles along either side of the ship. One torpedo broke through the net and hit amidships. "Empire Celt" later broke in half, but a tug from Newfoundland rescued 31 from the crew of 37.
As "U-558" was torpedoing ships on the starboard side of the convoy, "U-158" approached the port side and torpedoed British tanker "Diloma" at 0635. "Diloma" was the only one of the torpedoed ships to successfully reach Halifax. Both "U-158" and "U-558" dived to avoid being seen in the early daylight. "U-558" found and sank the "Eidanger", drifting and abandoned astern of the convoy, with gunfire and a torpedo. All of "Eidanger"s crew had been rescued. "Lea" investigated a DF bearing from "Toward" at 1515 and spotted "U-558" twenty miles (32 km) astern of the convoy at 1707. "Lea" dropped eight depth charges at 1746, and then surprised the U-boat on the surface at 1813 and dropped fourteen depth charges at 1847. "U-558" was undamaged.
"Nicholson" investigated a DF bearing from "Toward" and sighted "U-158" at 1323. "U-158" dived and evaded "Nicholson". "Nicholson" then slowed to listen. "U-158" surfaced at 1550 and was surprised to find "Nicholson" waiting 1500 meters away. "U-158" crashed-dived before "Nicholson" saw the U-boat. "U-158" surfaced again at 1817 and was surprised to find "Edison" away. "U-158" again avoided detection by crash-diving. "Edison" finally spotted "U-158" making another convoy approach at 2008 and dropped 25 depth charges over the following six hours. "U-158" was undamaged, but had been prevented from making further attacks on the convoy. 
Admiral Karl Dönitz, the BdU or commander in chief of U-Boats, ordered his U-boats to discontinue the attack on 25 February. The escort was reinforced on 26 February by the USCG Treasury Class Cutter "Spencer". The remainder of the convoy reached Halifax on 1 March 1942.

Aftershock (Law &amp; Order)

"Aftershock" is the 134th episode of NBC's legal drama "Law & Order", and the season finale of the sixth season. It originally aired on 22 May 1996.
"Aftershock" is notable because it abandons the typical "Law & Order" story structure of the police-procedural followed by legal proceedings. Rather than chronicling an investigation, the episode accompanies each of the characters in the aftermath of an execution.
Plot.
Jack McCoy, Claire Kincaid, Lennie Briscoe and Rey Curtis attend the execution of a man each had a part in helping to convict. Kincaid and McCoy fight briefly while driving back to the city. Kincaid decides to take a sick day, while McCoy returns to the office. Briscoe and Curtis have the day off, but Curtis decides to finish up some paperwork.
Curtis has a scuffle with a man in a holding cell and is ordered by Anita Van Buren to take the day off. He proceeds to meet a graduate student (Jennifer Garner) downtown and spends the day flirting with her while ignoring his wife's phone calls. He eventually spends the night with her.
Briscoe visits an off track betting facility and meets some acquaintances with "inside information." After losing some money, Briscoe meets with his estranged daughter and they go to lunch.
Kincaid visits her former law school professor (who is later revealed to be her stepfather) to discuss her concerns about capital punishment, and more broadly, her feelings about the legal profession and her role in it. She then has a late lunch with Van Buren and discusses the morality of capital punishment.
After dispatching a few plea bargains and lunch with Elizabeth Olivet, McCoy goes to a bar and meets some blue collar workers where they play darts and talk about their fathers. McCoy initially speaks highly of his father, a former police officer. However, after getting drunk, he reveals that his father demanded perfection from him, and would beat both him and his wife (McCoy's mother) for the slightest failure. He also states that he "never talks about these things."
Briscoe's talk with his daughter does not end well. He walks into the same bar that McCoy is at and orders a club soda, as he is a recovering alcoholic. After McCoy leaves in a cab, Briscoe seemingly becomes depressed and orders a vodka. Kincaid, whom McCoy had earlier called to get a ride home, meets a drunken Briscoe at the bar and offers to take him home.
While driving home, Briscoe laments the state of his relationship with his daughter, and says that he would have liked to have a child like Kincaid. As she tries to comfort him, a drunk driver slams into the side of their car, killing her.
The episode ends with a dazed Briscoe wandering in the accident scene, bursting into tears at the sight of Kincaid's dead body, as Van Buren reads part of a letter she has been writing to her mother about the execution in a voiceover:
Initially, it was not made explicitly clear that Kincaid was dead, with Jill Hennessy stating in interviews that she hoped to return to the series. However, a later episode ("Sideshow") in which McCoy is called to the witness stand to testify on his own behalf in an investigation, confirmed that Kincaid was killed in the accident.

Bartholomew studied cartography in Leipzig, Paris and at the University of Edinburgh and took over the family business John Bartholomew and Son Ltd. on the death of his father John George Bartholomew. He inherited the task from his father of completing the "Times Survey Atlas of the World" (1921), which was expanded into the Times Mid-Century Edition (issued in five volumes between 1955 and 1960). He introduced new cartographic techniques, modern printing and expanded the company significantly.
He was awarded the Military Cross after serving with the Gordon Highlanders and General Staff during the 1914—18 War.
He served as Honorary Secretary and President of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (1920–54) and was awarded the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London. In 1960 he was appointed C.B.E.
He entrusted the management of the company to his three sons, Peter, John and Robert.

1952 Chatham Cup

The 1952 Chatham Cup was the 25th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included North Shore United, Napier High School Old Boys, Wanganui United, Masterton Athletic, Kiwi United (Manawatu), Seatoun (Wellingtton), Woodbourne (Marlborough), Western (Christchurch), and Roslyn-Wakari (Dunedin).
The 1952 final.
The final was dominated by Western; they scored early through Noel Joseph, and it was only the heroics of North Shore keeper Roy Gordon who stopped the Christchurch side going further ahead. With ten minutes left to play Herb Moyle scrambled an equaliser and the match was sent to extra time. The added half hour was scoreless.
In the days prior to penalty shootouts and replays, tied matches were decided on the number of corners won, and it was only through the very last kick of the game that Western gained a corner to level the count. With the score and number of corners equal, it was decided that the trophy would be shared between the two sides. This was the only time this was to happen; replays were introduced to settle tied finals thereafter, with the first replay being played in the 1970 final.

Horse murders

The horse murders scandal refers to cases of insurance fraud in the United States in which expensive horses, many of them show jumpers, were insured against death, accident, or disease, and then killed to collect the insurance money. It is not known how many horses were killed in this manner between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, when a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation brought the horse killings to light, but the number is thought to be well over 50, and may have been as high as 100. In addition, in 1977, the heiress Helen Brach disappeared and was presumed by law enforcement agents to have been murdered by the perpetrators of these crimes, because she threatened to report their criminal activity to authorities; continuing investigations into Brach's death began to uncover the insurance fraud in the 1990s.
The scandal has been called "one of the biggest, most gruesome stories in sports" as well as "the biggest scandal in the history of equestrian sports."
Thirty-six people were indicted and tried for insurance fraud, mail and wire fraud, obstruction of justice, extortion, racketeering, and animal cruelty in connection with the horse murders; 35 were convicted. Of the 23 people indicted in Chicago in July 1994, 20 pleaded guilty.
The disappearance and murder of Helen Brach was never fully solved, although one man, Richard Bailey, is serving life in prison for soliciting her murder.
Over the 20-year period during which the horse murders took place, several different motivations led horse owners and trainers, often affluent and well-respected people, to become involved in what ultimately became a widespread conspiracy.
In some cases, the owner of a promising, or even prize-winning, horse was temporarily strapped for cash and decided to insure and then kill the animal; this was the situation in the 1982 murder of the show jumper Henry the Hawk.
Sometimes people bought over-valued horses. Rather than take a loss on a poor investment, these owners chose to finance their next horse purchase by defrauding the insurance company that had insured the unwanted horse. 
Another aspect to the scandal went beyond insurance fraud and involved racketeering. This scheme, a form of confidence game, consisted of bilking wealthy widows of their money by encouraging them to invest in horses. The animals were usually over-valued or under-performing, and the conspirators killed the animals in order to prevent the owners from uncovering how much they had overspent. In some cases, before the women invested, these non-performing animals were first "bid up" in value by the co-conspirators, in an attempt to make them seem more desirable to the purchasers. In other cases, a shill buyer would offer to co-purchase the horse from a conspiring owner or trainer, with each buyer putting up half the stated purchase price. The check from the shill buyer would be destroyed and the two con artists would deposit and split the money paid by the wealthy woman buyer. If she began to suspect that the horse she had purchased was relatively valueless, it would be killed for the insurance money, which would soothe her financially, and if the conspirators still had her confidence, she would then be encouraged to invest in another co-owned horse, repeating the cycle. The men who worked this form of confidence game often acted as gigolos to the widows they bilked. It was one of these schemes that the wealthy widow Helen Brach uncovered that — when she announced her intention to report the fraud that had been perpetrated on her — led to her disappearance and murder.
Famous cases.
Drucks' Henry the Hawk.
In 1981, 17-year-old Lisa Druck of Ocala, Florida (now known as Rielle Hunter) owned and rode a show horse named Henry the Hawk. Because Lisa (born June 6, 1964) was underage, her finances were controlled by her father, James Druck, an attorney and owner of Eagle Nest Farm. Druck's legal practice consisted of defending insurance companies against claims, and he knew that if a horse were electrocuted in a certain manner, it would be very difficult for a veterinary pathologist to find signs of foul play and the death would be chalked up to colic. According to ABC News, Lisa was "a prize-winning equestrian when her father was implicated in an insidious plot to electrocute horses for insurance money." 
In the early 1990s, following James Druck's death, convicted horse-killer and FBI informant Tommy Burns told authorities and reporters that James Druck had first attempted to sell his daughter's horse for $150,000, but the highest offer he received was only $125,000. He then hired Burns and personally taught him how to electrocute horses, even going so far as to buy Burns' first set of electrocution tools. The first horse that Druck hired Burns to kill was Henry the Hawk, whose life insurance policy was worth $150,000. James Druck thus started Tommy Burns on a 10-year-long career as a "horse murderer".
James Druck collected on a $150,000 insurance policy for arranging the killing of his daughter's horse in 1982, but he was under investigation by the FBI when he died of cancer in Tampa, Florida in 1990.
Helen Brach.
The wealthy socialite Helen Brach was another prominent victim. Brach was a millionaire candy company heiress and animal lover who vanished in 1977 at the age of 65. While her body was never found, she was declared dead in 1984. Investigators suspected that she was murdered because she threatened to reveal what she knew about the over-valuing of horses, which would have led authorities to the string of horse killings perpetrated by Richard Bailey, a man who was later indicted for a role in her murder.
The events surrounding Brach's murder were summarized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in adjudicating an appeal made by Richard Bailey:
In 1984, seven years after she disappeared, Helen Brach was declared legally dead. In 1997, the connections between her death and the conspiracy involving socially prominent horse owners and their hired horse killers became the subject of a true crime book, "Hot Blood: The Money, the Brach Heiress, the Horse Murders," written by Ken Englade.
The horse killers.
Tommy Burns.
Tommy "The Sandman" Burns (a.k.a. Timmy Robert Ray) earned his nickname because he "put horses to sleep" for the conspirators. He traveled the show circuit, visiting stables with his athletic bag full of electrocution equipment and, for fees ranging from $5,000 to $40,000 — generally for 10 percent of the insurance price on the horse — he would kill horses for their owners, who would then pay him off from the money obtained by defrauding the insurers. Burns justified his destruction of the animals on the grounds that electrocution — the technique that he had learned in 1982 from James Druck — was quick and painless. 
In 1992, the investigative reporters William Nack and Lester Munson, writing for "Sports Illustrated", interviewed Burns, who told them a great deal about how the conspiracy operated: 
Harlow Arlie.
In 1989, Burns was hired to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. This horse was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, who had once been a trainer at Paul Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already suffered from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would have to be put down by a vet. Burns decided to sub-contract the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar.
By this time, the FBI had Burns under surveillance, and although the agents were too far away to prevent the fatal injury to Streetwise, they were able to capture Burns and Arlie after a short chase. The two men confessed to the crime, and Burns, in retaliation for being left without legal aid by his powerful former employers, turned FBI informant and revealed the names of dozens of people who had hired him. As a result of his confession, 36 people were arrested for animal cruelty and insurance fraud, of whom 35 were convicted.
After testifying before the federal grand jury in Chicago investigating insurance fraud in the horse show industry, Harlow Arlie served eight months in jail for breaking Streetwise's leg.
Burns, who revealed the names of many other conspirators, was sentenced to a year in jail for his crimes, including breaking Streetwise's leg; he served six months. He still resides in Florida, where he has legally changed his name to Tim Ray; he currently sells auto parts for a living.
Richard Bailey.
Not only electrocution and leg-breaking were employed as methods to kill insured horses. When arson looked profitable, an entire stable could be burned to the ground, to collect on the building insurance as well as the horse insurance. Richard Bailey, who feuded with his brother, and Frank Jayne and his family, were said to have left "a trail of violence" in the horse-club world of the upper Midwest states of Illinois and Wisconsin over the course of decades.
Richard Bailey pleaded guilty to racketeering, mail and wire fraud, and money laundering charges in 1995 and was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the murder of Helen Brach.
The conspirators.
Paul Valliere.
Horse trainers also participated along with Burns in the conspiracy, including Paul Valliere, the owner of Acres Wild Farm in North Smithfield, Rhode Island. In 1994, Valliere admitted that he hired Burns to electrocute his show horse, Roseau Platiere, so that he could collect $75,000 in insurance money. Once he was apprehended, Valliere turned state's evidence. He wore a wire for a year, gathering information for the federal authorities who were investigating the conspiracy. 
Due to his cooperation with law enforcement, Paul Valliere was sentenced in 1996 to four years of probation and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine; he also was indefinitely suspended from participating in horse shows sanctioned by the American Horse Show Association. In 2006, Valliere attempted to gain reinstatement to the United States Equestrian Federation (formerly AHSA) causing outrage among those who recalled his crimes, and sparking an online campaign to have him permanently barred from participation in equestrian events.
Barney Ward.
One of Valliere's close friends, the Rhode Island-born trainer Barney Ward, who owned Castle Hill farm in Brewster, New York, also arranged horse-killings for wealthy owners; Burns said Ward arranged for Burns to commit 15 horse killings. 
Ward was charged in 1994 with arranging the killings of four horses. Although he claimed to be innocent of the charges, he pleaded guilty in 1996 to conspiring to kill four horses for their insurance payouts between 1987 and 1990: Charisma, Condino, Rub the Lamp and Roseau Platiere. In court papers he "admitted that he told the horse killer to keep quiet about the people who hired the killer to slaughter the horses, and, if he kept quiet about friends and business associates, [Ward would pay him money. that [Ward later spoke with the horse killer and [...] said that he would kill the horse killer if he did anything to hurt name="AHSA v Ward">[http://asci.uvm.edu/equine/law/cases/cruel/ward.htm "American Horse Shows Assn. v. Ward", 718 N.Y.S.2d 593, 186 Misc.2d 571 (2000)</ref> 
Ward was sentenced to 33 months in prison, followed by three years of probation, and ordered to make restitution of $200,000 to one of the defrauded insurance companies. Upon his release, Ward sued the AHSA, which had barred him from attending its sanctioned shows. He claimed that it was his right, as a private citizen and no longer a member of the AHSA, to watch his son compete in equestrian events. In 2000, the Supreme Court of New York found that argument meritless, ruling that Ward's membership in AHSA at the time of his criminal conduct, plus his promise to be bound by the organization's rules, authorized the AHSA to discipline him, regardless of his current membership status.
Donna Brown.
Donna Brown, the ex-wife of Paul Valliere's former associate Buddy Brown, was convicted of hiring Tommy Burns and Harlow Arlie to break Streetwise's leg.
The aftermath.
In 1993 Jane F. Clark, president of the 60,000-member United States Equestrian Federation (USEF), then known as the American Horse Shows Association (AHSA), which sanctioned 2,500 equestrian events, told "The New York Times" that her organization was giving federal authorities its complete cooperation and noted that she was "eager to see the investigation completed and any guilty parties brought to justice." By 1995, the AHSA (now USEF) had expelled a number of members who had been indicted for various crimes connected with the horse murders, including Marion Hulick, Barney Ward, and Paul Valliere.
A literary parallel.
In 1988 — long before the arrest of Tommy Burns and the subsequent unraveling of the horse murders conspiracy of silence — "Brat Pack" novelist Jay McInerney based a "roman à clef" novel, titled "Story of My Life", on the young adulthood of his former girlfriend Lisa Druck, James Druck's daughter. McInerney's novel implies that the cause of protagonist Alison Poole's "party girl" behavior is her father's abuse, including the murder of her prize jumping horse.
McInerney has said that he chose to write about Druck and her friends because he was both "intrigued and appalled" by their behavior, and the lead character, Alison Poole, who was closely modeled after Druck, was described as "an ostensibly jaded, cocaine-addled, sexually voracious 20-year old." "Story of My Life" opens with Alison Poole's description of her father and her seemingly casual comment that she gave up riding when her horse — called "Dangerous Dan" in the story — suddenly "dropped dead," details that closely parallel Lisa Druck's early life. 
In the novel, Allison Poole's horse is poisoned, not electrocuted, but at the end of the story, the orchestrator of the murder, just as in Druck's actual life, is revealed to have been the young woman's father: 
There was open speculation that "Story of My Life" was a "roman à clef" novel when it first appeared; to "New York Magazine"'s questions "Is it real? Did it happen?" McInerney replied, "I'm anticipating some of that kind of speculation, but I'm utterly confident of not having any lawsuits on my hands. The book is a fully imagined work of fiction. On the other hand, it's not to say that I didn't make use of … That's why I live in New York. Mine is not an autonomous imagination."
McInerney's references to the horse murder conspiracy went unremarked by sports journalists or the general media at the time of the novel's publication, because the scandal itself had not yet come to light in the national press, but the novel received renewed interest in the wake of the Edwards-Hunter extramarital affair. In August 2008, Vintage Books ordered an additional 2,500 copies of the book in the wake of the interest generated by the Hunter-Edwards scandal.

Owls Head Light

Owls Head Light is a lighthouse located in Owls Head, Maine at the entrance of Rockland Harbor on Western Penobscot Bay. The lighthouse was established in 1826. It is operated by the United States Coast Guard and it is also part of Owls Head Light State Park.
History.
The lighthouse was designed by Green & Foster and Jeremiah Barry and constructed in 1826. It is a tall cylindrical brick tower on a granite foundation standing on top a cliff. It has one of the last six Fresnel lenses in operation in Maine.
In 1854, a keeper's house was built separate from the lighthouse. The cottage now serves as Coast Guard housing. A fourth order Fresnel lens, in use until recently, was installed in 1856. A generator house and an oil storage building were added in 1895.
The light station was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Owls Head Light Station in 1978.

Steamboats on the Yangtze River

After thousands of years of junk and sampan traffic on the Yangtze River (Jiang), river steamers were introduced by Europeans during the mid- to late-nineteenth century. The age of the steamer
lasted nearly 150 years—from 1835 to 1980—and had lasting impacts on China, where river trade was
essential to the economy due to the poor road network and few railways. 
First Opium War.
The first merchant steamer in China, the "Jardine", was built to order for the firm of Jardine, Matheson & Co. in 1835. She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between Lintin Island, Macao, and Whampoa. However, the Chinese, draconian in their application of the rules relating to foreign vessels, were unhappy about a "fire-ship" steaming up the Canton River. The acting Governor-General of Kwangtung issued an edict warning that she would be fired on if she attempted the trip. On the "Jardine's" first trial run from Lintin Island the forts on both sides of the Bogue opened fire and she was forced to turn back. The Chinese authorities issued a further warning insisting that the ship leave China. The "Jardine" in any case needed repairs and was sent to Singapore.
It will not be difficult to exterminate the foreign devils<br />
then.
Push aside the railway track.
Pull out the telegraph poles ; 
immediately after this destroy the steamers.
The Boxer Rebellion was a disaster for China with more foreign involvement in the country.
Most of the warring took place in Peking and thus far from the Yangtze River.
Chinese ships on the Yangtze.
Yichang or Ichang, 1,600 km (1,000 mi) from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to Hankow, a distance of almost 1,000 km (almost 600 mi) from the sea. For about 320 km (about 200 mi) inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.
The Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the Nanyang Fleet, which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese rebuilt its fleet, only to have it ravaged by another war with Japan in 1895, the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time. With the Japanese advance into the east coast of China in 1938, enterprises and numerous people withdrew from Wuhan to the west and Sichuan. The Kuomintang navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River and covering the withdrawal. On 24 October, while patrolling the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou, in Wuchang (Jiangxia, Wuhan), the "Zhongshan" was bombed by six Japanese aircraft . The aircraft dived, strafed and bombed the "Zhongshan". Despite shooting down two of the aircraft, the "Zhongshan" eventually sank due to the serious damage she had sustained. Twenty-five Chinese officers and soldiers were killed in the battle.
Commercial involvement.
Steamers came late to the upper river. The three gorges and the strong current hindered navigation. Archibald Little attempted a voyage with the "Lee-Chuan", and the "Kuling", delays and weak engines meant that he only succeeded in the first vessel in 1898. Little soon built the first truly successful boat, the "Pioneer", in about 1899. She plied the river for two more decades and was even the flagship for the Royal Navy on the China Station. There were a few commercial steamers on the upper river at the turn of the century and the Boxer Rebellion period. 
The commercial firms of Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire, and Standard Oil had their own steamers on the river. Until 1881, the India and China coastal and river services were operated by several companies. In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, Ltd., a public company under the management of Jardines. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardines established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the Far East. Standard Oil ran the tankers "Mei Ping", "Mei An", and "Mei Hsia" on the river, in addition to many motor barges, launches, tugboats and other tankers. These three tankers, the largest in the oil company's fleet, operated on the river until 1937 when they were bombed by the Japanese in the USS Panay incident.
With the Treaty Ports, the European powers and Japan were allowed to float navy ships into China's internal waters. The British, US and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: Austro-Hungarians, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, and German navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Bank of Indochina was among the members of a western banking syndicate given control of China’s finances. French civil servants took control of China's postal service. In 1901 the gunboat "Orly" was detached from the Far East Squadron for a cruise up the Yangtze Kiang. The "Olry" was accompanied by the steam launch "Takiang" as far as Chunking before Lieutenant Hourst continued on in a vain search for an inland waterway linking Szechwan with Tonkin. The "Orly" very nearly was taken in a sinking in the Three Gorges in 1911. It hit the shore and damaged its rudder; out of control, it nearly foundered. However, excellent boatmanship and improvisation saved the day and the vessel.
The Japanese engaged in open war with the Chinese twice, and Russians twice, over conquest of the Chinese Qing empire—in the First and Second Sino-Japanese War 1895, and 1905; and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. Incidentally, both the French and Japanese navies were heavily involved in running Vietnamese opium and narcotics to Shanghai, where it was refined into morphine. It was then transhipped by liner back to Marseilles and France (i.e. French Connection) for processing in Germany and eventual sale in the US or Europe. 
In 1909 the gunboat USS "Samar" changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to Nanking and Wuhu. Following anti-foreign riots in Changsha in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, "Samar" sailed up the Yangtze River to Hankow and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the United States Asiatic Fleet that year, which had been re-established by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, "American interests in the Orient." After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on 1 July 1911. After staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, "Samar" broke free and sailed back down river to take on coal. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and Ichang in September, where she overwintered, owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at Wuchang in October 1911. Tensions eased, and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. "Samar" patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial warlords in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze river steamer that damaged her bow.
The seamen's strikes were staged by the seamen at Hong Kong and by the crews of the Yangtse River steamers early in 1922. The Hong Kong seamen held out for eight weeks. After a bitter and bloody struggle, the British imperialist authorities in Hong Kong were finally forced to raise wages, lift the ban on the Seamen's Union, release the arrested workers and indemnify the families of the martyrs. The crews of the Yangtze steamers went on strike soon afterwards, carried on the struggle for two weeks and also won victory.
Increased US presence.
The Spanish boats were replaced by newer vessels in the 1920s. "Luzon" and "Mindanao" were the largest, "Oahu" and "Panay" next in size, and "Guam" and "Tutuila" the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the twentieth century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the Nanjing Incident in 1927 when the Communists and Nationalists broke into open war. Chiang Kai-shek's massacre of the Communists in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, US Marines with tanks were landed.
River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second USS "Palos" protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, "Palos" was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Yichang and Chongqing throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army.
In the second half of 1934 Settle arrived in China, tasked with sailing USS Palos (PG-16) 1,300 miles (2,100 km) up the Yangtze River from Wusong to Chongqing.Palos, a gunboat stationed around Shanghai since 1914, had recently been refitted and over time became twice as heavy against her original displacement (340 vs. 180 tons), making her hardly capable of the upstream journey.[6 In 1929 alone, of 67 Yangtze steamers three were totally destroyed by the rapids with 47 casualties; a thousand junk sailors perished every year.
Royal Navy boats on the Yangtze River.
Of course, the British Royal Navy had three generations of gunboats on the Yangtze River spanning fifty years. The first were the "Heron"-class river gunboats, of
which HMS "Nightingale" [1897-98]; and HMS "Robin", HMS "Sandpiper", HMS "Snipe" served on Yangtze and West Rivers until 1914 and were sold in 1919.
Later, in the "Woodcock" Class of gunboats came into service: these included the "Woodcock", "Moorhen", "Teal" and "Widgeon".
The "Insect"-class gunboats, built in Britain for service on the Danube in 1915, were moved to the China Station and the Yangtze River in the 1920s.
Concomitant to the "Insect" class were the "Dragonfly" class of smaller boats—"Dragonfly", "Grasshopper", "Locust" and "Mosquito". Unfortunately, most of these became casualties of war in 1942 with the Japanese attacks.
In 1926 the Wanhsien incident, brought the attention of the perils of China. A local warlord seized the Swire steamer Wahsien and held ship and officers for ransom. British gunboats attended and fired. The officers escaped, and the gunboats shelled the shoreline, from where the Chinese were firing rifles and artillery at the boats. (See HMS Cockchafer.)
Japanese takeover.
On January 28, 1932, the Japanese attacked the Chinese nationalists around Shanghai. Around midnight, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed the city in the first major aircraft carrier action in the Far East. Three thousand Japanese troops proceeded to attack various targets, such as train stations, around the city. From 1931 to 1933, the cruiser "Tenryū" was assigned to patrol the Yangtze River and was thus in combat during the January 28 Incident at Shanghai in 1932. The Battle of Shanghai of 1937 was the first of the twenty-two major engagements fought between the National Revolutionary Army, Republic of China and the Imperial Japanese Army, Empire of Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war. On August 13, 1937, the Japanese and Chinese exchanged fire in Shanghai in the ongoing war. The Chinese 88th Division retaliated with mortar attacks. Sporadic shooting continued through the day until 4pm, when the Japanese headquarters ordered the naval ships of the Third Fleet, stationed in the Yangtze and the Huangpu River to open fire on Chinese positions in the city. In the late night of August 13, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Zhang Zhizhong to begin the Chinese offensive the next day. On August 22, the Japanese 3rd, 8th, and 11th Divisions made an amphibious assault under cover from naval bombardments and proceeded to land in Chuanshakou (川沙口), Shizilin (獅子林), and Baoshan (寶山), towns on the northeast coast some fifty kilometers away from downtown Shanghai. Japanese landings in northeast Shanghai suburban areas meant that many Chinese troops, who were deployed in Shanghai's urban center, had to be redeployed to coastal regions to counter the landings.
The most infamous incident was the Panay incident, when USS "Panay" and HMS "Bee" were dive-bombed by Japanese aircraft in late 1937 during the Rape of Nanking.
The tanker Mei Ping was sunk in the same attack. After that outrage, much of the population and government of China fled inland to the wartime capital at Chungking, thousands
of journeys were made by steamer. Whole factories, libraries, and households were picked up and moved up the perilous river. Even the National Palace Art Collection,
the storied treasure of the Chinese Emperors, was boxed and moved inland. Junks, carts, and sampans were pressed into service, and cargoes kedged through the
Three Gorge Rapids, with ropes and gangs of men.
In 1939 the Japanese put further restrictions on foreign shipping on the lower Yangtze, trying to undo the near British Monopoly. The Europeans were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover of the Settlements in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service.
The Post War Period.
After the Japanese surrender, the Communists and the Nationalists continued their civil war. The Americans and British tried to re-instate their presence as it had been before the war, but following the communist takeover in 1949, non-Chinese shipping companies ceased operations on the Yangtze. 
In 1949, the SS "Shenking" of the Butterfield and Swire Line made an epic rescue of stranded civilians from Shanghai, running them across the China Sea to Keelung, Formosa.
One steamer sank in 1947, drowning 400 people. 
Mao and the Chinese Communist Party
journeyed upriver by steamer in 1959 to Lushan to the Lushan Conference to discuss the Great Leap Forward. However, little is known in the west about this period, as China became a closed country. Many retired North American steamers were sent to Japan or Taiwan for scrapping. Some were pressed into mainland china service. By the 1970s China embarked on its own ship and engine building programs, and steamers have since been replaced by diesel tugs, freighters and ferry boats.

Yellowstone National Forest

Yellowstone National Forest was first established by the General Land Office on March 30, 1891 as the Yellowstone Park Timber Land Reserve of . On May 22, 1902 it became the Yellowstone Forest Reserve with lands of . 
The reserve was first suggested by General Philip Sheridan in 1882 after a visit to Yellowstone National Park. Sheridan recommended that the park be expanded to the east and to the south. Legislation was introduced by Senator George Graham Vest to accomplish this, but it was stalled by local opposition. The American Forestry Association took up the cause, preparing legislation that would allow the United States president to set aside lands as "forest reservations" through an executive order. President Benjamin Harrison then proclaimed the reserve, largely following Sheridan's recommendation, on March 30, 1891. Some areas on the northeast portion of the proposed reservation were excluded to allow mining in the headwaters of the Clark Fork River. The land was, in effect, the first national forest. For the time being, it was placed under the same military administration that applied to Yellowstone Park proper.
In 1902 lands were exchanged with the Teton Forest Reserve and the reserve was placed under civilian administration, with the first ranger station in the nation established at Wapiti on the Shoshone River. Artist and rancher Abraham Archibald Anderson was named as the first Special Superintendent of Forest Reserves. 
On January 9, 1903 lands of the first Absaroka and Teton Forest Reserves were added, and on March 4, 1907 it became Yellowstone National Forest. In 1905 all federal forests were transferred to the U.S. Forest Service. On July 1, 1908 as part of a major reorganization, the forest was divided into Targhee, Teton, Wyoming, Bonneville, Absaroka, Shoshone and Beartooth National Forests, and the name was discontinued.

<doc id="18869677" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18869677" title="First same-sex marriage in Spain">
First same-sex marriage in Spain

The first same-sex marriage in Spain took place after the Roman Imperial era on 8 June 1901.
Two women, Marcela Gracia Ibeas and Elisa Sanchez Loriga, attempted to get married in A Coruña (Galicia, Spain). To achieve it Elisa had to adopt a male identity: Mario Sánchez, as listed on the marriage certificate. It is the first attempt at same-sex marriage in Spain for which there is recorded evidence. It was performed by the Church, in the parish church of St. Jorge of the same city. Subsequently the parish priest discovered the deception, and was denounced and persecuted. Nevertheless, the marriage certificate was never annulled.
Their matrimonial union took place more than 100 years before the law would permit gay Spanish people to get married. The two worked as teachers at a time when the vast majority of the Galician population was illiterate.
This event could be considered a precedent for same-sex marriage in Spain. News of their wedding was spread to all Spain and to various European countries. The couple is believed to have escaped to Argentina, and it is unknown what happened to them after that.
First encounter, separation and reunion.
Marcela and Elisa met while studying in the Teacher-Training College for Teachers in A Coruña, where the future teachers of elementary education were educated. Their friendship gave way to a more intimate relationship. Marcela's parents, seeing that the friendship was growing beyond that socially permitted and fearing a possible scandal, sent their daughter to Madrid. Time went by and both, one in A Coruña and the other in Madrid, finished their studies. They were reunited again when Elisa was appointed as a temporary teacher at Couso, a small parish of Coristanco in A Coruña. Nearby, in Vimianzo, in the village of Calo, Marcela established herself already as a superior teacher. As a consequence of the same, they decided to live together in Calo, where Elisa worked. In 1889, Marcela had to go to teach classes at Dumbría while Elisa remained in Calo, but they stayed in contact until Elisa moved to the town where Marcela lived.
False identity and marriage.
In 1901, Elisa adopted a masculine appearance (with which she appeared in the Teaching College to apply for a certificate of study), fabricated a past, and was transformed into Mario. For this invented past, she took as reference a cousin of hers killed in a shipwreck. Furthermore, she made up that she had passed her childhood in London and that her father was an atheist. Considering this last circumstance, the father Cortiella, parish priest of San Jorge, baptized Mario on 26 May 1901 (furthermore, he received first communion), and subsequently married the couple on 8 June 1901 after the publication of the banns. The marriage ceremony was short; the sponsors bore witness to its validity; and the couple passed the night of the wedding in the boarding house Corcubión, on the street of San Andrés.
Consequences.
Finally, the neighbours could not remain indifferent as before, with what was at the moment known as a "marriage without man". The couple were exposed by Galician and Madrid newspapers and, as a consequence of this, both quickly lost their jobs, were excommunicated, and were issued an arrest warrant. It appears that, so that the excommunication could take place, the parish priest requested a doctor examine Mario to check if he was a man or a woman. Mario agreed. When the doctor issued his verdict, Mario attempted to pass for a hermaphrodite whose condition had been diagnosed in London. The Civil Guard pursued the couple to the town of Dumbrías, where they both worked as teachers. There is evidence that they passed for Vigo and Oporto in their escape. The last that is known of them is that they managed to board a ship destined for America (possibly Argentina, as so many other Spaniards of the era), where they spent their honeymoon and, finally, stayed to live. One of the cases that one of the courts took against them was closed. Several years later, some residents of Dumbría spread a rumour about the death of Elisa and the subsequent marriage of Marcela to a man. This rumour has not been confirmed.
It is possible to stress that the wedding, according to the Diocesan Archive, is still valid. Neither the Church nor the civil registry annulled the marriage certificates, so this is the first recorded same-sex marriage in Spain.
On 18 December 2008, the book "Elisa e Marcela – Alén dos homes" (Elisa and Marcela – Beyond men) was published in A Coruña. The 300-page book, written in Galacian, tells the story of the two women from the time they fled Coruña in 1901 until 1904. It narrates the events in Porto, Portugal, where they were imprisoned, tried, and later released. They fled to Argentina after the Spanish government demanded their extradition from Portugal.
Before leaving Porto for the Americas, Marcela gave birth to a girl. After they landed in Buenos Aires, Elisa (under the alias of Maria) married Christian Jensen, a man 24 years her senior, in 1903. Marcela, under the alias of Carmen, stayed there with his sister and her daughter. 
After time, when Elisa refused to consummate the marriage with Christian, he became suspicious. Upon investigation, he discovered that Maria and Carmen were in fact Elisa and Marcela, which the press had realised long ago.
Once again, the courts were faced with trying to annul Jensen's marriage. Since the marriage was between a man and a woman, and therefore valid, no charges were brought against Elisa. After that time, in 1904, there no further record of Marcela and Elisa.
Social and legal impact.
Nowadays this event is considered one of the oldest precursors to same-sex marriage in Spain. In the media the courage of these two women is emphasized, stressing that they went into history as the first gay marriage in Spain.
Isaías Lafuente (editor in chief of Cadena SER), in his book "Agrupémonos Todas", looks at the highlights of feminism in the twentieth century and indicates the story of Marcela and Elisa as one of the most significant events related to the movement occurring in Galicia (another is the figure of Emilia Pardo Bazán).
The group Milhomes founded the Marcela and Elisa Award, which, with the help of the FELGTB, is already in its sixth edition. They also claim a long street with their name in A Coruña, with little success so far.
In 1902 the book "La sed de amar", by the Extremaduran writer Felipe Trigo, was published in Spain. This was a book of great impact in that period. It includes the story of Marcela and Elisa, using the names of Rosa and Claudia, respectively. The profile of these two women and the story of their relationship is transcribed to the fiction of the book with almost total equivalence to the real story. Felipe Trigo's own footnotes in one edition of the book state that the story is real and happened in A Coruña in 1901.
Very first documented same-sex marriage in 1061.
A same-sex marriage between the two men Pedro Díaz and Muño Vandilaz in the Galician municipality of Rairiz de Veiga in Spain occurred on 16 April 1061. They were married by a priest at a small chapel. The historic documents about the church wedding were found at Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova.
First legal same-sex marriage in 2005.
Although the first known attempt at same-sex marriage is that of Marcela and Elisa, same-sex marriage was legalized in Spain in 2005, by law 13/2005. The first legal same-sex marriage in Spain took place on 11 July of that year, in Tres Cantos, Madrid, between Emilio Menendez and Carlos Baturin, who had lived as a couple for more than thirty years. The first marriage of two women under the law was 11 days later, in Barcelona.

Dead Loretta

Dead Loretta was a Psychedelic rock band from Newark, Delaware. Formed in 2004, Dead Loretta got its start when songwriters Danny Boles and Marky Degz decided to expand their acoustic duo project "Bruce Lee's Grave" into a four piece rock band. Heavily influenced by 1960s British Invasion and local pop heroes The Spinto Band, the original lineup consisted of Degz on lead vocals/guitar, Boles on lead guitar/vocals, Brian Lafferty on bass/harmonica, Andrew Kerstetter on drums, and Alex McGrellis on keyboards.
History.
Dead Loretta played its first show in June 2005 at My Place Tavern in Dover, opening for the band She Slash He. Later that same year, the group released an EP entitled "Bring A Date". The five song disc included a jangly pop number called "Miranda", which caught the ear of Vanstock Records owner Dwight Lyghtning, who immediately signed the band. Miranda enjoyed airplay in Delaware's 93.7 WSTW and New York's WECW 107.7. Shortly thereafter, as the band began work on their full length album, Kerstetter departed and was replaced by Max Pressman. Alex McGrellis also left the band to pursue acting, eventually landing a role in "Rocky VI". 
With a new drummer and a record deal, Dead Loretta began recording their full length self-titled album, with Brett Stewart of Deep Groove Studios. Degz penned the singles "Symphony of Wasted Youth" & "Brooklyn", while Boles contributed "Spain vs. Portugal" & "Dirt Bike". During this time, the band shared the stage with various international acts, including Pete Doherty's side project Littl'ans, legendary Smashing Orange front man Rob Montejo, Brian Jonestown Massacre collaborator Christopher Tucker, and "Rolling Stone" Magazine featured band The Singles. Despite Dead Loretta's progress, they were abruptly dropped from Vanstock Records after Degz and Dwight Lyghtning engaged in a heated altercation midway through a show at Mojo 13 in Wilmington in December 2007. Degz reportedly threw his guitar to the ground and stormed out of the club amidst a hailstorm of boos and heckling from rowdy audience members. This would be the band's final live performance. The full length album, to this date, has not been released.

Kaligandaki A Hydroelectric Power Station

Kaligandaki A Hydroelectric Power Station is situated at Mirmi of Syangja District about 300 km to the West of Kathmandu and 100 km from Pokhara in the same direction in Nepal. The Headworks is situated in Mirmi at the intersection of two perennial rivers, Andhikhola and Kaligandaki A whereas the power house is in Beltari(About 7 km towards the South-East of Mirmi).
It is a run of river type of project and currently is the largest power plant of any kind in Nepal capable of generating 144 MWs of Electricity. Construction started in the year 1997 and was completed in the year 2002. It was constructed primarily to curb the ever increasing energy demand at that time and eliminate load-shedding prevalent due to the imbalance in demand and supply of energy. It was constructed with the financial aid of the Asian Development Bank with total costs reaching up to 50 billion NPR (Approx). These days it plays a pivotal role in balancing the power management system in Nepal.
The project is a daily peaking type ROR project able to generate 144 MWs for full 24 hrs during the 3 months of Monsoon with the Generation dropping to about 70 Mega-Watts during the dry season. The Project however is equipped with Peaking pondage facility which enables it to generate 144 MWs for about 6 hrs even in the extreme dry season every day when demands are high (evenings). The Natural path of the river has been used for the pondage facility thus eliminating the need of a separate infrastructure for pondage.
Transmission line.
The power generated by the three turbines is evacuated to the central grid via a 132kV single circuit, a long transmission line to Pokhara, and a double circuit transmission line to Butwal. The electricity is sent to Lekhnath Municipality and Butwal (known as Butwal-1 and Butwal-2). A sub-station has been constructed in Lekhnath Municipality, Kaski district and the existing Jogikuti substation in Butwal has been upgraded.

Director Yoshida has stated that the film is "about Japan" and that the "concept of a 'hated' species is not unlike the racial and cultural enmity with which Japan is perceived." In his New York Times review, Vincent Canby wrote, "The publicity material for 'Twilight of the Cockroaches' describes the film as an allegory about the fate in store for affluent Japan if it doesn't meet its international responsibilities. The film may read that way in Japan. In this country, it looks somewhat darker and more muddled." 
The English dub of the film was produced by Streamline Pictures. During the early-to-mid 1990s, the film was shown frequently on Turner Broadcasting stations such as TBS, TNT and Cartoon Network, often paired with "Vampire Hunter D" and "Robot Carnival". As a result, it was one of the first exposures to anime for many American anime fans.
The film currently has no official Region 1 DVD release. The film has also not been reduced by any other anime company due to it going out of print.

Dog grooming

Dog grooming refers to both the hygienic care and cleaning of a dog, as well as a process by which a dog's physical appearance is enhanced for showing or other types of competition. A dog groomer (or simply "groomer") is a person who earns their living grooming dogs.
Reasons for grooming.
Grooming or pet grooming is an important part of dog care. All Breeds require daily grooming, how much depends on the breed, age, or health of the pet. Regular grooming helps to ensure the dog is healthy and comfortable. It is important to note that while many dogs "shed", others (such as the Poodle), do not shed (see Moult) as profusely, and require grooming by a professional every 6–8 weeks maximum.
The main reasons for daily grooming include:
Tools and supplies.
Curry or Curry Brush: A tool made of rubber or plastic with short "teeth." The tool is rubbed (or "curried") over the dog's coat to loosen dirt, hair, and other detritus, and stimulate the skin into producing natural oils. Metal currycombs should never be used, as they are designed for removing hair from brushes only.
Currycombs usually have the handle made of plastic or wood. They are more commonly used for dogs that have large amounts of hair that has shed such as for the German Shepherds. They are also used for untangling knots in certain parts of the dog's body such as ears, paws or tail. Using a currycomb must be done carefully as the action of this type of tool can harm the skin of the dog, if pulled too hard.
Shedding blade: A metal shedding blade with short, dull teeth is used to remove dead hair from certain types of harsh coats. The shedding blade is not used to cut the hair.
Scissors and clippers: Cutting tools used to remove/shorten hair on certain types of coats or in sensitive areas. Not all types of coat are suitable for clipping, i.e. double coats on breeds such as Border Collies keep the dog cool in summer and warm in winter, and should not be clipped unless the dog is matted. The typical pair of scissors for dog grooming is between 6.5 and 9 inches long, longer than typical hair dressing scissors. Some are designed with a blunt tip to prevent any injuries due to the dog moving around.
Stripping Combs/Knives: Tools used to help grab the longer hairs on a harsh coat and pull them out by the root. Helps maintain a proper coat in many terriers and schnauzers. Most often used on show dogs.
Grooming a dog before it is bathed is important as it frees up and removes dead undercoat and matting, and allows proper penetration of water and shampoo to the skin. This can be done by using a slicker brush all over its body, especially on its legs, and the places where knotting occurs frequently. Groomers sometimes use a metal comb when combing for the second time, paying more attention to the toes and between the toes. Metal combs can be helpful in the areas of the dog's body that are common spots for knots. Brushing and combing the tail is also important as it is a commonly missed area.
Dog brushes come in various sizes and shapes can be made from metal, plastic and wood. Although there are many types of dog brushes, they are not very popular amongst the professional dog groomers as most of them prefer using teasels. Dog brushes are perfect for breeds that have long and fragile hair, especially if the coat is getting properly taken care of. Common dog brushes are the bristle brush, wire pin brush, and the slicker brush.
The bristle brush is one of the most widely used types of brushes mainly because it can be used for any type of coat. As a general rule, longer and widely spaced bristles are suitable for dogs with longer coats and shorter and tightly-packed ones are better to use on dogs with short hair. Typically, the bristle brush is used on dogs with long coats to finish the coat and to bring out the natural lustre and shine of the coat. It is commonly used in daily grooming as it removes surface dust and dirt.
Dogs with medium to long hair are often brushed with a wire pin brush. The wire pin brush is also great for dogs with curly coats. They usually have an oval shape and have meal bristles set in a flexible rubber base. This type of brushes is great for dogs with long, wiry, wavy and curly coats as they are useful in separating and untangle the coat. Pin brushes are of better quality if they have polished pins or coated pins which prevent from scratching and harming the dog's skin. Because the coating or polish may go away over time, the pins of such a brush should be replaced once in a while. Pin brushes come in a variety of sizes, textures and fullness, depending on the type of coat that they are needed for.
Slicker brushes are typically used after primarily brushing with a bristle or a wire pin brush. They are used to smooth the coat and to take out mats and tangles. They are provided with fine wire pins that are secured to a flat base. The pins are bent at an angle approximately halfway down the pin. The slicker brush is typically used on dogs with long coats and those with curly coats. For heavier and thicker coats, one is recommended to use a brush with stiffer pins. This type of brush comes in a wide range of sizes and degrees of pin stiffness.
There are also brushes that combine the pin and bristle styles. This type of dog brushes are maybe the most convenient as they have the advantage of having two brushes in one. The combination pin/bristle brush has two different sides, one with bristles which can be successfully used for grooming the short hair areas of the coat, and another side, with pins that can be used for long-coated and double-coated dogs.
"Matt combs" These are special combs that help to 'cut' matted hair from the dog's coat without leaving a bald spot.
Rakes are important grooming tools especially for double-coated dogs such as the Newfoundlands or Siberian Huskies. They are good in removing dead hair from the undercoat. The undercoat rake's teeth are especially designed to penetrate through the overcoat down into the thick undercoat to remove loose hair faster and easier than a standard comb. Rakes can also be used for untangling and dematting.
The Coat King is a particular type of stripping knives, useful in hand stripping for the removal of dead undercoat prior to clipping. These tools are suitable for many dog breeds and coats and they have become more and more popular among dog owners and groomers. They are a good tool for removing loose hair, and thick undercoats. Also, they can be used for dematting and detangling. Although they are quite a new grooming instrument, they are now widely used and recommended for dog owners.
Stand dryers are also available for a quick drying of the dog's coat. Commonly, when a dog is brought to a groomer this implies a thorough cleaning of the coat as well. And because the dog cannot leave the shop while wet, special driers have been manufactured. These can be stand driers, cage driers or hand driers and are more common in professional grooming places than in the owner's house. Drying a dog with a dryer designed for humans is not recommended as it could cause scalp irritation, dry skin or skin sores.
Shampoos and conditioners are common grooming supplies used by every dog owner. Owners are recommended to use only shampoos, conditioners and rinses that are especially designed for dogs.
Bath tubs are supplies more commonly found in professional grooming shops. They are made of a variety of materials, including galvanized steel. Also, these shops may have bathing systems and sprayers available for a better grooming as well as for the comfort of the pet.
Dog owners who want to groom their pets at home will need ear and eye supplies. Also a variety of combs and brushes for their specific breed of dog. Cleaning the ears and the eyes of the dogs is also part of a complete grooming. Different ear and eyes kits are available on the market and they are especially designed for this matter. They are however meant to be carefully handled and one should not use other products in cleaning the dog's eyes and ears than those that are intended for it.
Dental care may be most important while grooming, just like humans a clean mouth can impact the pets health greatly as it ages. This is however quite a difficult mission, given that dogs hardly allow their teeth to be brushed. The dental kits available on the market include everything from special tooth paste to toothbrushes. Many models of toothbrushes include a three flexible head design which maintains the proper pressure on all surfaces of the tooth with every stroke. These brushes have side bristles set the 45-degree angles to reduce the arm twisting and soft outer bristles for massaging the gums. Toothpaste designed to be used on dogs is usually natural sugar free toothpaste with different flavoring. Foaming or rinsing is not necessary.
Finishing touches can be added with finishing supplies, including perfumed sprays, ribbons and many other accessories.
Flea control products are also part of grooming supplies. There is a wide variety of flea and tick control products that are applied to dogs while grooming. If ticks or fleas are found on the pet, they must be quickly removed and grooming is the perfect time to do it. The specially designed such products must be used for few months in order to ensure that the pet is parasite free.
Grooming tables make the entire activity more comfortable and safer, but they are normally used by professional groomers and owners who have dogs that enter competitive shows. These tables do provide a secure and productive environment for grooming, but many single dog owners can avoid this expense by simply using what is available in the home.
Bathing.
Dogs can be bathed by being sprayed with a hand-held shower head, or doused with water from a bucket. Often, one bath will not make a dog truly clean. A second bath is excellent to ensure the entire body has been cleaned. Dogs should be bathed with warm, not hot water, in order to make it a more enjoyable experience. Dogs with a heavy or matted coat should never be bathed without first being completely brushed out or clipped of any mats.
Many types of shampoos and conditioners formulated for dogs are available; however, using a shampoo without mixing it with water may be a bit strong for a dog that's just getting a touch-up bath. If the dog isn't filthy, water is mixed with shampoo in a 1:1 ratio to make it easier on the dog and to make sure it rinses entirely. If any shampoo remains on the dog after the bath, it may become irritating to the skin. Most dogs do not require frequent bathing; shampooing a coat too often can strip the coat of its natural oils, causing it to dry out.
Hair removal.
The coats of many breeds require trimming, cutting, or other attention. Styles vary by breed and discipline. While some hair removal has its origins in practical purposes, much is based on the taste of the owner, whether or not the dog will be shown, and what work the dog does.
The rubber grooming gloves and dog brushes are intended to drag loose hair from the short-coated dogs and are some of the most popular grooming tools amongst pet owners. They are easy to use, as using them basically means massaging the coat in firm strokes and have the advantage of being suitable for both wet and dry coats.
Some breeds of dog, such as the Lhasa Apso, do not shed fur but have hair that grows constantly. As such, the fur around the legs and belly can get very long and become matted and the hair around the eyes can impair the dog's vision. In such circumstances, hair trimming can be performed to keep the eyes clear of fur and keep the main body free of knots. However, some owners prefer breeds, such as the Lhasa, to have long, flowing coats that reach down to the floor and will undertake a greater brushing regime than is required for a dog that has its fur kept shorter.
Stripping.
Stripping or hand-stripping is the process of pulling the dead hair out of the coat of a non-shedding dog, either by using a stripping knife or the fingers. A hard, wiry coat has a cycle where it starts growing and then sheds as it reaches maximum length. Hand-stripping coordinates the shedding and makes room for a new coat to grow. Stripping is the proper grooming method for most terriers, spaniels, and many other breeds. The hair is removed with either a stripping knife or stripping stone, with the top coat removed to reveal the dense, soft undercoat. If done correctly, the procedure is painless. Many dogs are reported to enjoy having their hair stripped, especially when they are introduced to it as puppies.
Nail trimming.
Nail trimming is essential for maintaining good health. If a dog's nails are allowed to grow, they will curl over into a spiral shape; walking will become increasingly painful to the dog as they grow, putting pressure on the dogs toes (a bit like walking in shoes that are too small). Uncut nails may curl so far that they pierce the paw pad, leading to infection and debilitating pain. If one does not trim a dog's nails on a monthly basis the quick will grow along with the nail, making it nearly impossible to cut properly. Owners may choose to trim nails themselves or may opt to take their pet to a groomer or veterinarian.
Nail trimming is done with a nail clipper. There are two main types of nail clippers, the guillotine clipper and the standard scissors nail clipper.
Creative grooming.
Additional options that some groomers provide include services such as colouring dogs' fur and painting dogs' nails. 
While traditional grooming achieves to conform with breed standards set by the official breed associations, creative grooming heads to the opposite direction, creating a unique, sometimes exquisite look.
The lighter version of creative grooming is known as pet tuning and is more owner-oriented, adjusting the pets' visual appearance to their owners' amusement or life style, while the creative grooming is more of an art form, therefore more artist (groomer) oriented.
Other services.
Groomers may also sell products for dogs' fur and other products such as dog clothing.

Ludwig Stickelberger

Ludwig Stickelberger (May 18, 1850 – April 11, 1936) was a Swiss mathematician who made important contributions to linear algebra (theory of elementary divisors) and algebraic number theory (Stickelberger relation in the theory of cyclotomic fields).
Short biography.
Stickelberger was born in Buch in the canton of Schaffhausen into a family of a pastor. He graduated from a gymnasium in 1867 and studied next in the University of Heidelberg. In 1874 he received a doctorate in Berlin under the direction of Karl Weierstrass for his work on transformation of quadratic forms to a diagonal form. In the same year he obtained his Habilitation from Polytechnicum in Zurich (now ETH Zurich). In 1879 he became an extraordinary professor in the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg. From 1896 to 1919 he worked there as a full professor, and from 1919 until his return to Basel in 1924 he held the title of a distinguished professor ("ordentlicher Honorarprofessor"). He was married in 1895, but his wife and son both died in 1918. Stickelberger died on April 11, 1936 and was buried next to his wife and son in Freiburg.
Mathematical contributions.
Stickelberger's obituary lists the total of 14 publications: his thesis (in Latin), 
8 further papers that he authored which appeared during his lifetime, 4 joint papers with Georg Frobenius and a posthumously published paper written circa 1915. Despite this modest output, he is characterized there as "one of the sharpest among the pupils of Weierstrass" and a "mathematician of a high rank". Stickelberger's thesis and several later papers streamline and complete earlier investigations of various authors, in a direct and elegant way.
Linear algebra.
Stickelberger's work on the classification of pairs of bilinear and quadratic forms filled in important gaps in the theory earlier developed by Weierstrass and Darboux. Augmented with the contemporaneous work of Frobenius, it set the theory of elementary divisors upon a rigorous foundation. An important 1878 paper of Stickelberger and Frobenius gave the first complete treatment of the classification of finitely generated abelian groups and sketched the relation with the theory of modules that had just been developed by Dedekind.
Number theory.
Three joint papers with Frobenius deal with the theory of elliptic functions. Today Stickelberger's name is most closely associated with his 1890 paper that established the Stickelberger relation for cyclotomic Gaussian sums. This generalized earlier work of Jacobi and Kummer and was later used by Hilbert in his formulation of the reciprocity laws in algebraic number fields. The Stickelberger relation also yields information about the structure of the class group of a cyclotomic field as a module over its abelian Galois group (cf Iwasawa theory).

Dakshinamurthy Stotram

The Dakshinamurthy Stotram is a hymn to Shiva, explaining metaphysics of this universe,Advaita Vedanta.
Introduction.
The "Dakshinamurthy Stotram" expounds the theory or philosophy of Advaita vedanta. It was written by Adi Shankara.
Dakshinamurthy is an incarnation of Shiva, the supreme god of knowledge. Dakshinamurthy is an aspect of Shiva as a guru of all types of knowledge, and bestower of jnana. This aspect of Shiva is his personification as the supreme or the ultimate awareness, understanding and knowledge. This form represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of yoga, music, and wisdom, and giving exposition on the shastras.
A "Stotra" or "Stotram" ("") is a Sanskrit word, for a hymn addressed to Divinity. It can be a prayer, a description, or a conversation.
Unlike most of the stotras of Hindu gods, which are in the form of description of anthropomorphic forms, or mythological deeds of those gods, Dakshinamurthy stotram takesform of conceptual and philosophical statements. Repeated chanting and/or meditating on the meaning of these verses is expected to help a spiritual practitioner of Advaita vedanta get thoroughly established in an Advaitic experience.
The "Dakshinamurthy stotram" is arguably the most important small verse to be attributed to Adi Shankara. In a compilation of ten stanzas there is a concise and vivid description of the philosophical significance of the form of Siva, giving the very essence of the Indian idea of epistemology. It differs from every other attempt in a very basic sense, in that it is holistic rather than purely reductionist.

How to Make Gravy

How to Make Gravy is a four-track EP by Australian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly and was originally released on 4 November 1996 on White Label Records in Australia. The title track was written by Kelly and earned him a 'Song of the Year' nomination at the 1998 Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) Music Awards. It tells the story of a newly imprisoned man writing a letter to his brother, in which the prisoner laments that he will be missing the family's Christmas celebrations. The same character appears in Kelly's earlier songs, "To Her Door" (1987) and "Love Never Runs on Time" (1994). The gravy recipe is genuine – Kelly learnt it from his first father-in-law. It was covered by James Reyne on the 2003 tribute album, "Stories of Me: A Songwriter's Tribute to Paul Kelly" and on Reyne's 2005 acoustic album "...And the Horse You Rode in On". It has also been covered by David Miles, From Nowhere, Semicolon, Ghostwriters, Karl Broadie and Lawrence Agar. In September 2010, Kelly titled his memoirs, "How to Make Gravy". On 29 September 2012 Kelly performed "How to Make Gravy" and "Leaps and Bounds" at the 2012 AFL Grand Final.
Background.
Paul Kelly's album, "Wanted Man", was released in 1994 and reached No. 11 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart. Kelly also composed music for the 1994 film "Everynight ... Everynight", directed by Alkinos Tsilimidos, it is set in the notorious H division of Victoria's Pentridge Prison. Kelly's next solo releases were "Deeper Water" in 1995 and "Live at the Continental and the Esplanade" in 1996. Between March and May 1995 Kelly undertook a seven-week tour of North America, appearing on several dates with Liz Phair and Joe Jackson. 
By 1996, Paul Kelly Band members were Stephen Hadley (bass guitar, ex-Black Sorrows), Bruce Haymes (keyboards), Peter Luscombe (drums, ex-Black Sorrows) and Shane O'Mara (guitar). Spencer P. Jones (guitar, Beasts of Bourbon) guested on some performances. This line-up issued the CD-EP, "How to Make Gravy", with the title track earning Kelly a 'Song of the Year' nomination at the 1998 Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) Music Awards. In August 1996 Kelly performed the song at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival, with O'Mara on slide guitar, which was included on "Edmonton Folk Festival Compilation Album" (1996). The song was included in 1998 as an extra track on the US release of "Words and Music" by Vanguard Records. That year, "How to Make Gray" was also issued as a US single but with a different cover: it depicts a roasted fowl on a serving tray held by a smiling woman with the words 'Christmas Single' included. Kelly and his nephew Dan Kelly recorded the song as part of Kelly's A – Z Tours from 2004 to 2010, it was issued on the 8× CD album, "The A – Z Recordings" (2010).
Composition.
"How to Make Gravy" is a song with a length of five minutes and ten seconds. The song is set in the key of E major and has a medium tempo with a piano range of B1–E5 and a vocal range of B3–E5. Kelly is credited with both lyrics and music. The lyrics tell the story of a newly imprisoned man writing a letter to his brother, in which the prisoner laments that he will be missing the family's Christmas celebrations. The same character is the protagonist in earlier songs by Kelly, "To Her Door" (1987) and "Love Never Runs on Time" (1994). All three tracks appear on Kelly's live 8× CD boxed set, "The A – Z Recordings" (2010).
In 1996 Kelly was approached by Lindsay Fields, the guitarist and backing vocalist for John Farnham, to perform a Christmas-themed song or carol for a various artists charity record, "The Spirit of Christmas", to raise money for the Salvation Army. Kelly originally selected "Christmas Must Be Tonight" by Robbie Robertson (The Band) however that had already been performed by James Blundell on "The Spirit of Christmas 1994", so he told Fields that he would have a go at writing one instead. Kelly later recalled, "I had a rough tune I'd been kicking around with the band at sound check, but was having trouble getting started on the words. Kelly's inspiration for the lyrics was subsequently drawn from Irving Berlin's "White Christmas", where "Irving intensifies the feeling of Christmas by not being there". He advised Fields, "I have a Christmas song but it doesn't have a chorus and it's set in a prison". Fields was overcome with emotion when he first heard it and convinced the Salvation Army's selection group to accept it for the collection.
The gravy recipe is genuine – Kelly learnt it from his father-in-law: "Just add flour, salt, a little red wine and don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce". In the late 1970s, Kelly met his future wife, Hilary Brown, at one of his early gigs – the relationship is described in the 1992 song, "When I First Met Your Ma", written for their son, Declan (born 1980). In 1984 Brown and Kelly divorced.
Cover versions.
It was covered by James Reyne on the 2003 tribute album, "Stories of Me: A Songwriter's Tribute to Paul Kelly" and on Reyne's 2005 acoustic album "...And the Horse You Rode in On". It has also been covered by David Miles, From Nowhere, Semicolon, Ghostwriters, Karl Broadie and Lawrence Agar. John Butler performed the song at a Kelly tribute show which was recorded on the related triple album, "" (2010).
Reception.
"How to Make Gravy" was nominated as 'Song of the Year' at the 1997 Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) Awards, which was won by Savage Garden's "Truly Madly Deeply". Kelly was also nominated and won 'Best Male Artist' at that year's ARIA Awards on the success of the song. It was also nominated as 'Song of the Year' at the 1998 Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) Music Awards, which was won by Leonardo's Bride's "Even When I’m Sleeping".
Allmusic's Tom Hallet praised the track in his review of the US version of "Words & Music", "cult maestro Kelly draws on a rich tapestry of characters and true to life situations, and has his finger firmly planted on the universal heartbeat with loose, catchy yarns ... one on Christmas in jail".
In 2008 John Butler selected the song as his favourite Australian song of the last 20 years:
On 29 September 2012 Kelly performed "How to Make Gravy" and "Leaps and Bounds" at the 2012 AFL Grand Final although most of the performance was not broadcast on Seven Network's pre-game segment. Nui Te Koha of "Sunday Herald Sun" declared "Kelly, an integral part of Melbourne folklore and its music scene, and a noted footy tragic, deserved his place on the Grand Final stage – which has been long overdue ... broadcaster Seven's refusal to show Kelly's performance, except the last verse of 'Leaps and Bounds', was no laughing matter".

James Grant (Waterloo)

Major-General James Grant C.B. (1778 – 5 April 1852) was the son of James Grant of Dalvey, of the line of the Baronets Grant of Dalvey, Elgin, themselves an offshoot of Grant of Grant. He was born in Middlesex in 1778.
Army career.
He joined the Army in 1797 and served 5 years in India with the 25th Regiment of Foot. He saw action at the Battle of Mallavelly, Siege of Seringapatam and at Doondia. At the storming of the fort of Turnioul, he volunteered and led the assault with fifty dismounted dragoons. Over the course of 3 years, he took part in the capture of more than 15 fortresses. By 1806, he was serving with the 21st Fusiliers during the Sicilian campaign, which concluded the War of the Third Coalition with the Battle of Maida. For 1807-1811, he returned to India with the 17th Light Dragoons. He returned to Europe in 1811 and joined the 18th Hussars, within the army under the Duke of Wellington. He saw action at the Battle of Toulouse and the Battle of Waterloo. He was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, with effect from the date of Waterloo. He married shortly afterwards and spent his time between France and Hillingdon, where he leased nearby Hayes Park House from 1829 to 1843. The extended Grant family appear several times in the autobiography of their neighbour, Anthony Trollope. Grant was promoted to Colonel in 1837 and to Major-General in 1846. He was appointed Governor of Scarborough Castle and was created Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath (C.B.)
Throughout these years, he attended the annual 'Waterloo Banquet', hosted by the Duke of Wellington at Apsley House on the 18 June each year for soldiers who had fought with him at Waterloo. He was present at the 1851 Banquet. He died at his home in Colham Green, Hillingdon, Middlesex on the 5 April 1852, was buried at St Mary's Church, Hayes, and was remembered by his former comrades at the 1852 Waterloo Banquet, shortly ahead of the Duke's own death.
Family.
On 6 October 1817 at St Mary's Church, Hayes, Middlesex, he married:

Gianotti–Crosti syndrome

Gianotti–Crosti syndrome (also known as "Infantile papular acrodermatitis," "Papular acrodermatitis of childhood," and "Papulovesicular acrolocated syndrome") is a reaction of the skin to a viral infection. Hepatitis B and Epstein-Barr virus are the most frequently reported etiologies. Other incriminated viruses are hepatitis A, hepatitis non A-non B, strep, cytomegalovirus, coxsackie, adenovirus, enterovirus, rotavirus, rubella, HIV and parainfluenza.
It is named for Ferdinando Gianotti and Agostino Crosti.
Clinical features.
Gianotti–Crosti syndrome mainly affects infants and young children. Children of age as low as 1.5 months and up to 12 years of age are reported to be affected. It is generally recognized as a papular or papulovesicular skin rash occurring mainly on the face and distal aspects of the four limbs. Purpura is generally not seen but may develop following application of tourniquet. However extensive purpura without any hemorrhagic disorder has been reported. The presence of less florid truncal lesions does not exclude the diagnosis. Lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly are sometimes noted. Raised liver transaminases with no rise in conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin are sometimes detectable, although the absence of such does not exclude the diagnosis. Spontaneous disappearance of the rash usually occurs after 15–60 days.
Diagnosis.
The diagnosis of Gianotti–Crosti syndrome is clinical. A validated diagnostic criteria is as follows:
A patient is diagnosed as having Gianotti–Crosti syndrome if:
The positive clinical features are:
The negative clinical features are:
Differential diagnosis.
The differential diagnoses are: acrodermatitis enteropathica, erythema infectiosum, erythema multiforme, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Kawasaki disease, lichen planus, papular urticaria, papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome, and scabies.
Treatment.
Gianotti-Crosti disease is a harmless and self-limiting condition, so no treatment may be required. Treatment is mainly focused on controlling itching, symptomatic relief and to avoid any further complications. For symptomatic relief from itching, oral antihistamines or any soothing lotions like calamine lotion or zinc oxide may be used. If there are any associated conditions like streptococcal infections, antibiotics may be required.

Universal (Esperantido)

Universal is an Esperantido, a constructed language based on Esperanto. Grammatically, it is one of the more interesting: It has inclusive and exclusive pronouns, uses partial reduplication for the plural ("tablo" "table", "tatablo" "tables"), and inversion for antonyms ("mega" "big", "gema" "little"; "donu" "give", "nodu" "receive"; "tela" "far", "leta" "near"). Inversion can be seen in,
The antonyms are the pronouns "al" "he" and "la" "she", the "ge-" (completive) and "eg-" (inchoative) aspects, the verbs "fin-" "to finish" and "nif-" "to begin", and the verbs "graf-" "to write" and "farg-" "to read".
The "Universal" reduplicated plural and inverted antonyms are reminiscent of the musical language Solresol.
Orthography.
The Latin alphabet is used with IPA values, with four additional IPA letters: The affricates are written . The schwa is used to break up consonant clusters in compound words and the like.
A palatalized consonant is marked with a hacek, a nasalized vowel with a tilde: ã (among other things, nasalization marks the accusative case; a long vowel by a circumflex: â
If stress is not marked, it falls on the last non-schwa vowel preceding the last consonant of the word. Otherwise it is marked by an acute accent: á.
Grammar.
Inflectional morphology.
As in Esperanto, Universal nouns are marked by the suffix "-o," which is elidable in certain cases. "O" by itself is a subordinating conjunction:
As in Japanese, adjectives and verbs are a single part of speech in Universal. They have two forms, an attributive form when they modify a noun like an adjective, and a predicative form when they stand on their own to form a clause like a verb.
The predicative form is marked by the suffix "-u: urbo megu" "(the) city is big", "lampo pendu" "(the) lamp is hanging". On its own before a noun, this "u" is a copula: "formiko u insekto" "(the) ant is an insect". Tenses are optional. (See below.)
As in Esperanto, the attributive form is marked by the suffix "-a: mega urbo" "big city", "penda lampo" "hanging lamp". This "a" on its own is a preposition: "podo a tablo" "leg of a table", "luso a deno" "light of day, daylight". Nouns may instead be converted directly into attributives with the suffix "-j-: denja luso" "daylight".
Personal pronominal roots end in "i," as in Esperanto, but inflect for number and gender as do nouns. (See below.) Possessives take the "-j-" that converts nominals to verbals as well as the attributive "-a: mi" "I", "mija "my, mine"; "vi" "you", "vija" "your, yours"; "al" "he", "alja" "his"; "la" "she", "laja" "her, hers"; "lo" "it", "loja" "its", etc.
Optional inflection.
Plurality and pluractionality may be shown through reduplication, usually partial: "tatablo" (or "tablo-tablo)" "tables", "dendeno" or "dedeno" "days", "kloklora" "of many colours", "marmarʃu" "walk repeatedly".
Tense is also optional, and may be used with verbs or nouns. The affix "e" indicates past tense when prefixed "(ebela" "formerly beautiful", "eʃefo" "ex-boss"), but future tense when suffixed and stressed "(sanéa" "healthy-to-be", "urbéo" "city-to-be"). The imperative is marked by the prefix "ʒ-," which often requires a schwa to break up consonant clusters: "ʒədonu" "give!", "ʒəluso" "let there be light".
Oblique case (direct and indirect objects) may be marked by nasalisation of the final vowel of the noun and also of any attributives: "ʒədonu zeã librõ" "give this book!". This includes the conjunction "o: ʒənifu õ grafu" "start writing!".
Gender is optionally indicated by the prefixes "al-" for masculine "(altigro" "he-tiger", "al-Dʒonson" "Mr Johnson"), and "la-" for feminine "(latigro" "she-tiger", "la-Dʒonson" "Ms Johnso"). In a few words gender is marked by "a," infixed before the last consonant for the masculine "(tigar" or "tigaro" "male tiger"), suffixed and stressed for the feminine "(tigrá" or "tigráo" "tigress"). Even verbs can be marked for gender, with the meaning of performing the action in a masculine or feminine way.
Personal pronouns take gender in "a," and may drop their characteristic "i" ending when they do, just as nouns may drop their "o:"
and similarly with formal "vi, av(i), va(i);"
The latter forms use reduplication for plurality: "alali" "they" (masc.), "lalai" "they" (fem.).
Derivational morphology.
Some of the structure of Universal words is apparent at a glance, but cannot be easily extended to create new vocabulary.
As in the Semitic languages, vocalic ablaut derives roots with related meanings, such as "lina" "long", "lana" "wide", and "lona" "tall", or "valdo" "forest", "veldo" "savannah", and "vildo" "steppe".
Inversion is used to create antonyms, and is so characteristic of Universal that one of its creators jested that the language should be called "Inversal".
As in Esperanto, extensive compounding keeps the number of roots low; cf. "simpatu" "sympathise" and is partial inversion "mispatu" "be hostile". However, a number of frequent compounds are contracted into new roots: "dennedo → dendo" "day and night", "evdeno → evdo" "morning", "evnedo → evno" "evening", "evzaro → evzo" "spring", "evrazo → evro" "autumn".
The personal pronouns have somewhat irregular morphology. The bare roots are all singular:
The plurals are based on Esperanto "ili" "they":
Compounds are used to specify clusivity:

Jackson v. Bishop

Jackson v. Bishop was a case decided in 1968 on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States by then-judge Harry Blackmun. It abolished corporal punishment in the Arkansas prison system.
Issue.
The issue in the case was how to apply the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment to the conditions within a prison.
Background.
Arkansas rules authorized prison officials to beat inmates with a five-foot leather strap known as a "bull hide." An earlier suit had resulted in a decision permitting the use of the strap, provided that "appropriate safeguards" were in place.
Blackmun's writings.
Few precedents had existed for applying the Eighth Amendment to prison conditions. In pre-opinion writings, Blackmun wrote that constitutional standards evolve, as opposed to remaining static; he noted that nearly every state had abandoned corporal punishment in prison. Blackmun supported banning corporal punishment in prisons entirely.
Opinion.
Blackmun held that use of the strap in question is punishment that "runs afoul" of the Eighth Amendment. He wrote that "any so-called safeguard is entirely unworkable" and that the strap "is abhorrent to public opinion."
Reception.
Blackmun's opinion received favorable notice from both the judicial and public community.

Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics

Canada hosted and participated in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. Canada previously hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Canada sent a team of 206 athletes (116 men, 90 women), including participants in all 15 sports, and finished with 14 gold medals and 26 in total (ranking 1st and 3rd respectively), surpassing their previous best medal performance at the 2006 Winter Olympics. The 14 gold medals also set the all-time record for most gold medals at a single Winter Olympics, one more than the previous record of 13 set by the former Soviet Union in 1976 and Norway in 2002. Canada was the first host nation to win the gold medal count at a Winter Olympics since Norway at the 1952 Winter Olympics. 
Brian McKeever became the first Canadian athlete to be named to both Paralympic and Olympic teams, although he did not compete in the Olympic Games.
Preparation.
In May 2009, a motion for the Canadian Olympic team to wear seal skin on their uniforms was unopposed in Canadian parliament. The motion read: "That, in the opinion of the House, the government should take advantage of the opportunity provided by the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games to promote seal products, particularly by studying the possibility of using these products in the making of the Canadian Olympic clothing." The motion was proposed by Raynald Blais of the Bloc Québécois in protest of the European Parliament's passing of a bill to ban the import of seal products. Canadian Olympic Committee chief executive officer Chris Rudge quickly dismissed the idea, saying "It would be inappropriate for us and I think it would be inappropriate to use the athletes as a voice for issues that accrue to other elements to our society."
Own the Podium program.
After Canadians failed to obtain a gold medal in 1976 or 1988, the Canadian Olympic Committee pledged to make Canada the top medal winning nation at 2010. They started the Own the Podium program and the Canadian government invested $120 million into the program.
Hockey uniform controversy.
Since 1994, Canadian national hockey team players have worn uniforms that feature the logo of Hockey Canada, the governing body of the sport in Canada. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not allow the use of national federation logos, but did not strictly enforce the rule until the 2008 Summer Olympics. Canadian hockey teams used the Hockey Canada logo at the 1998, 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympics, because the IOC does allow an exemption if the nation's National Olympic Committee approves. The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) chose not to support an exemption. Chris Rudge, the COCs chief executive officer, said "Canada is discontent is that we're not going the extra mile to go for an exemption for ... but it's not our fight, it's the IOC's rule, and Hockey Canada knew this was coming. [... We got directives on the summer uniforms two years ago, and we shared it then with the winter sports. We told them we didn't have the directives for winter sports at that time, but they had to know it was coming. … We let them know it would be a harder issue than before." Hockey Canada executives, concerned that they would lose money through apparel sales, unsuccessfully protested the decision. Bob Nicholson, president of Hockey Canada, said "The COC is supposed to lead Canada into the Olympics and hopefully this isn't the way the COC is going to lead us over the next 13 months. [...] I just wish they would support us at the IOC level and they did not do that and I don't like that type of teammate." A new design was unveiled on August 17, 2009. According to Nicholson, the new jerseys will only be used in the 2010 tournament, and players will use the old version at other international tournaments.
Alpine skiing.
The Canadian alpine skiing team is guaranteed 14 athletes, which is down from the original 22 (the maximum number a NOC may enter). The International Ski Federation (FIS) announced that the number of overall alpine skiers would be limited to 320, and that some of the guaranteed spots would go to smaller nations, so that there will be a more international field. Canada was originally guaranteed 14 skiers, although the number was later raised to 18, and can still enter a full team of 22 if other athletes meet the qualification standards. Gary Allan, president of Alpine Canada, feels that Canada should be allowed 22, arguing that television coverage and crowd reception will be better. Canada was allowed a team of 19 skiers, which was announced on January 27, 2010. That number was later increased to 22 when other nations were unable to fill their quotas.
Prior to the announcement of the team, several athletes thought to be medal contenders were injured severely enough to keep them out of the Olympics, including 2009 Alpine World downhill champion John Kucera, Kelly VanderBeek, François Bourque and Jean-Philippe Roy.
Biathlon.
Canada sent eight biathletes to Vancouver. Canada had four individual entries in women's events but only one individual entry in men's events. However, as the host nation Canada was allowed to send a men's relay team. The men's team comprised Jean Philippe Leguellec, Marc-André Bédard, Brendan Green and Robin Clegg. The women's team, meanwhile, comprised Zina Kocher, Megan Imrie, Megan Tandy and Rosanna Crawford.
Bobsleigh.
As the host nation, Canada was guaranteed an entry in all three events (two-man, two-woman and four-man). Canada's full 12 athlete team was announced on January 27, 2010.
Cross-country skiing.
The 11 athlete team was announced on January 22, 2010. The team consisted of Ivan Babikov, George Grey, Alex Harvey, Devon Kershaw, Stefan Kuhn, Brian McKeever, 2006 gold medalist Chandra Crawford, Daria Gaiazova, Perianne Jones, 2006 silver medalist Sara Renner and Madeleine Williams. Brian McKeever, who is legally blind, competed at the 2002 and 2006 Winter Paralympics in both cross-country skiing and biathlon. He won four gold medals (two at each Games) in cross-country skiing as well as a silver and a bronze in biathlon. He would have been the first athlete in Olympic history ever to compete in the Winter Olympics after participating in the Paralympics. Four more cross-country skiers were announced on January 27, 2010: Drew Goldsack, Brent McMurtry, Gordon Jewett and Brittany Webster.
Curling.
Canada qualified both a men's and women's team. The representatives were decided at the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, held December 6–13, 2009, in Edmonton. Brad Gushue and his team, the gold medalists in the men's tournament in 2006, were unable to qualify for the trials, and did not get the chance to defend their gold medal. In the men's tournament, Canada was represented by the team of Kevin Martin, John Morris, Marc Kennedy and Ben Hebert. This was the second Olympic tournament for Martin, who won a silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics. In the women's tournament, the team of Cheryl Bernard, Susan O'Connor, Carolyn Darbyshire and Cori Bartel participated.
Freestyle skiing.
The full 18 athlete freestyle skiing team was announced on January 24, 2010. Dave Duncan was originally named to the men's ski cross team, but he broke his collarbone during a training run at the Olympics and was unable to compete. Brady Leman was named his replacement. However, Leman aggravated a broken tibia he suffered in 2009, and also did not compete. Replacing both of them was Davey Barr.
Figure skating.
Canada qualified two athletes or pairs in each of the four events for a total of 12 athletes. Participants were decided at the 2010 Canadian Figure Skating Championships.
Ice hockey.
National teams are co-ordinated by Hockey Canada and players are chosen by the team's management staff. The men's and women's national teams both qualified for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
With Vancouver being home to the Canucks, the 2010 Winter Olympics were the first to take place in an NHL market since the league started allowing its players to compete in the games in 1998 in Nagano, Japan.
Men's tournament.
A group of about 45 players were invited to an orientation camp in August 2009 (although players not invited could also have been named to the team) and the final 23 man roster was announced on December 30, 2009. The team was coached by Mike Babcock and included assistant coaches Ken Hitchcock, Lindy Ruff and Jacques Lemaire.
Group play.
Canada played in Group A.
All times are local (UTC-8).
Women's tournament.
In March 2009, the national team staff named 22 players to the 2009 World Championship team, as well as four additional players who would not compete in 2009 but could potentially be included in the Olympic roster. The final roster of 21 players was announced on 21 December 2009. Brianne Jenner, Jocelyne Larocque, Delaney Collins, Jennifer Wakefield and Gillian Ferrari were included in the centralized roster, but were cut before the Olympics. The team, which includes 14 Olympic veterans and seven players making their Olympic debut, is coached by Melody Davidson.
Group play.
Canada will play in Group A.
All times are local (UTC-8).
Luge.
Canada's Olympic luge team, announced on December 19, 2009, in Whistler, British Columbia, consisted of ten athletes: six individual competitors and two teams for the doubles event. The women's team consisted of Alex Gough, Regan Lauscher and Meaghan Simister. The men's singles team will comprise Sam Edney, Jeff Christie and Ian Cockerline. For the men's doubles event, two teams participated: Chris & Mike Moffat; and Tristan Walker & Justin Snith. The Fast Track Group, the title sponsor of the team, announced that they would give $1 million (which would be split between the athlete and Canadian Luge Federation) to any athlete that won a gold medal. The company also offered $50,000 for a silver and $5,000 for a bronze.
Nordic combined.
Canada sent a single athlete, Jason Myslicki, to compete in the Nordic combined.
Note: 'Deficit' refers to the amount of time behind the leader a competitor began the cross-country portion of the event. Italicized numbers show the final deficit from the winner's finishing time.
Short track speed skating.
As the host nation, Canada can send a full team of five men and five women for short track speed skating. Charles Hamelin finished third overall at the 2009 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships and was guaranteed a spot in the 2010 team by Speed Skating Canada. At the Canadian short-track speedskating trials, Jessica Gregg, Marianne St-Gelais, Kalyna Roberge and Tania Vicent earned spots on the women's team and Olivier Jean and Guillaume Bastille earned spots on the men's team with their performances. Valérie Maltais and François Hamelin were added to the women's and men's teams respectively as discretionary picks by the coaches. François-Louis Tremblay was unable to participate in the trials due to an ankle injury, but was given a bye and was named to the team. The number of skaters that will participate in each event will be determined by the team's performances at the first three World Cup events for the 2009/2010 season.
Skeleton.
Canada's full six athlete team was announced on January 27, 2010.
Ski jumping.
Canada's ski jumping team comprised Stefan Read, MacKenzie Boyd-Clowes, Trevor Morrice and Eric Mitchell. None of them reached the final.

2008 Toronto International Film Festival

The 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, (TIFF) was held in Toronto, Canada. This 33rd annual festival was from September 4 to September 13, 2008. The opening night gala was the World War I romantic epic "Passchendaele" from Canadian director Paul Gross.
About the 2008 Festival.
Festival is heavy on Canadian fare as well as featuring prominent indie films and worldwide and/or North American debuts including: "Adoration" directed by Canada's own Atom Egoyan, "Appaloosa" the second film from Ed Harris (who directed "Pollock"), "Blindness" from screenwriter-director, Fernando Meirelles, Iraq war thriller "The Hurt Locker" directed by Kathryn Bigelow, and veteran filmmaker Barbet Schroeder's "Inju, la bete dans l'ombre". Scheduled is "The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond" (directed by Jodie Markell), based on a "rediscovered" Tennessee Williams screenplay. TIFF screened 312 films from 64 countries. These include 249 features, most of which were North American and/or world premieres.
Neil Burger (director of "The Illusionist") world premiered "The Lucky Ones" a character study of U.S. soldiers on an unplanned road trip, starring Tim Robbins.
Also featured was "Me and Orson Welles" helmed by American "slacker" Richard Linklater, the Spike Lee-directed World War II film, "Miracle at St. Anna" as well as the Jonathan Demme directed film "Rachel Getting Married". Other festival highlights are screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's first film, "Synecdoche, New York", a slice of experimental filmmaker James Benning's Americana "RR" was featured in the "Wavelengths" avant-garde showcase, the four-hour-long Steven Soderbergh epic "Che" (playing in two parts), as well as "The Wrestler" lensed by Darren Aronofsky. The Brits are also well represented with "Happy-Go-Lucky" directed by Mike Leigh and "Slumdog Millionaire" directed by Danny Boyle.
Despite showing fewer films than last year, among the 249 features, 116 are premieres and 61 are first features. Films from as many as 64 countries were screened, with more than 340,000 admissions expected.
"Canadian Open Vault", which always highlights a restored Canadian film, focused on Quebec filmmaker François Girard's "32 Short Films About Glenn Gould" made in 1993.
Actors Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Benicio del Toro, Ethan Hawke, Laura Linney and film directors Julian Schnabel, Kathryn Bigelow and Steven Soderbergh are among the celebs the festival has invited on its 500-plus guest list, thus completing its lineup.
The festival closed on September 13, 2008 with the North American premiere of "Stone of Destiny" written and directed by Charles Martin Smith, the true story of four Glasgow university students who try to restore the 300-pound Stone of Scone to its rightful Scottish home.
With the film "Fifty Dead Men Walking", Rose McGowan expressed support for the cause of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), with the reports of her comments being released into the media on September 11, 2008. After starring in "Fifty Dead Men Walking", she was quoted as saying "I imagine had I grown up in Belfast, I would 100% have been in the IRA. My heart just broke for the cause. Violence is not to be played out daily and provide an answer to problems, but I understand it." Her comments were attacked by the original author Martin McCartlend. McCartland had general objections against the film, but approved of an out of court settlement, believed to be in the region of £20.000 (35.000 USD in summer 2008).

Aariya language

Aariya is an apparently spurious language of Madhya Pradesh, India. 
According to a submission made in 2007 to the ISO 639-3 Registration Authority which resulted in having language code withdrawn, the only reference for the language was a 1970 work entitled "A bibliographical Index of the Lesser Known Languages and Dialects of India and Nepal" by Richard Hugoniot, which relied on information provided by the Madhya Pradesh Department of Tribal Welfare from 1964 and indicated the presence of the Aariya as a scheduled tribe. 
Nothing is known of the language. Recent studies have failed to reveal either any speakers of the language or anyone with knowledge of the language. Whether this means the language never existed or if the population that spoke it was wiped out is not clear.

Mes Fantaisies

Mes fantaisies is the first album by French singer Shy'm. It was released in November 2006 and achieved much success in France, where it reached number six and was certified Platinum. It provided five singles, three of which were released physically. It yielded two top 5 singles in France—"Femme de couleur" and "Victoire"—and a further top 15—"Oublie-moi". The album is composed primarily of midtempo R&B, and contains a cover of Gilbert Montagné's 1984 song, "Le Blues de toi".
Commercial performance.
Released in November 2006, the album could only manage a debut of number 38 and by the start of December was as low as number 70. However, it gradually rose up the charts due to the impending release of "Victoire" and in January 2007 reached its peak of number six, which it stayed at for two weeks. The album remained a consistent presence in the French album chart due to its successful singles run and went on to spend 86 weeks in the French albums top 200, earning a Platinum certification for sales of 100,000.
Singles.
The first single taken from "Mes fantaisies" was "Femme de couleur", released on the 15 September 2006. A midtempo, summery R&B song, "Femme de couleur" was a successful debut single, entering the French singles chart at number six, before reaching its peak of number five. The song went on to spend thirteen weeks in the French top 200.
The second single from the album was "Victoire", which became the album's biggest hit. Released on the 16th of February 2007, the single entered the French chart at number four, outpeaking "Femme de couleur" by once place. It went on to spend 23 weeks in the French top 200, and ended 2007 as the 25th best selling single of the year in France.
The third single was "T'es parti", which was never released as a CD and thus never charted in France as at the time digital sales did not count towards the chart. However, the fourth single, "Oublie-moi" was released on CD, and was thus able to chart. It only managed a peak of #14 in the French chart, becoming Shy'm's first physically released single to miss the top 10. However, it spent 21 weeks in the French top 200, outlasting "Femme de couleur" and only just coming short of the length of time "Victoire" spent top 200.
The fifth and final single from the album was "Rêves d'enfants", which also was not released on CD. It became Shy'm's second single not to officially chart.

North Central Conference (IHSAA)

The North Central Conference is an IHSAA-sanctioned athletic conference consisting of eight large high schools in Cass, Delaware, Grant, Henry, Howard, Huntington, Madison, and Wayne Counties across East Central and North Central Indiana. Most of these schools are in 35,000+ population towns like Anderson, Marion, Kokomo, Muncie, and Richmond. Several of the nation's largest gymnasiums belong to members of this conference.
History.
The Conference was formed in 1926 by 10 schools in the Central third of Indiana. The original teams were Anderson, Arsenal Tech of Indianapolis, Frankfort, Kokomo, Lebanon, Logansport, Muncie Central, New Castle, Richmond, and Rochester. With a couple of minor changes in the first decade (Lafayette Jeff replacing Rochester in 1931, and Marion replacing Lebanon in 1933), the conference membership remained unchanged, while the conference added more sports to its umbrella.
This changed in 1960, and Arsenal Tech was forced to join the IPS Conference, and Frankfort left to co-found the Sagamore Conference in 1967. The conference would continue on with the same eight members for the next 36 years while changes were happening in the communities outside the schools. Anderson, Kokomo, and Muncie would open up second and third city high schools, while consolidations in the rural areas outside of Lafayette would give Jeff two similar-sized local rivals. However, the economic crisis and industrial decline in the late 1970s and early 1980's hit many of these cities hard, as populations dwindled without anything replacing the lost manufacturing jobs. Anderson and Kokomo are now down to one high school each, and Muncie may drop from two to one within coming years.
In the face of these population shifts, Lafayette Jeff joined the Hoosier Crossroads Conference in 2003, joining local rivals Harrison and McCutcheon, as well as the growing suburban schools outside of Indianapolis. Huntington North was brought in from the Olympic Conference as a replacement, where it had previously had conference rivals located in Muncie and Anderson.
