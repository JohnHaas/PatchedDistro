Culture of the United States

The culture of the United States is primarily Western, but is influenced by Native American, African, Asian, Polynesian, and Latin American cultures. A strand of what may be described as American culture started its formation over 10,000 years ago with the migration of Paleo-Indians from Asia, as well as from Oceania and Europe, into the region that is today the continental United States. The United States of America has its own unique social and cultural characteristics such as dialect, music, arts, social habits, cuisine, and folklore. The United States of America is an ethnically and racially diverse country as a result of large-scale migration from many ethnically and racially different countries throughout its history as well as differing birth and death rates among natives, settlers, and immigrants.
Its chief early European influences came from English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish settlers of colonial America during British rule. British culture, due to colonial ties with Britain that spread the English language, legal system and other cultural inheritances, had a formative influence. Other important influences came from other parts of Europe, especially Germany, France, and Italy.
Original elements also play a strong role, such as Jeffersonian democracy. Thomas Jefferson's "Notes on the State of Virginia" was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and a reactionary piece to the prevailing European consensus that America's domestic originality was degenerate. Prevalent ideas and ideals that evolved domestically, such as national holidays, uniquely American sports, military tradition, and innovations in the arts and entertainment give a strong sense of national pride among the population as a whole.
American culture includes both conservative and liberal elements, scientific and religious competitiveness, political structures, risk taking and free expression, materialist and moral elements. Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. individualism, egalitarianism, and faith in freedom and democracy), American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity. The flexibility of U.S. culture and its highly symbolic nature lead some researchers to categorize American culture as a "mythic" identity; others see it as American exceptionalism .
It also includes elements that evolved from Indigenous Americans, and other ethnic cultures—most prominently the culture of African Americans, cultures from Latin America, and Asian American cultures. Many American cultural elements, especially from popular culture, have spread across the globe through modern mass media.
The United States has traditionally been thought of as a melting pot, however beginning in the 1960s and continuing on in the present day, the country trends towards cultural diversity, pluralism and the image of a salad bowl instead. Due to the extent of American culture, there are many integrated but unique social subcultures within the United States. The cultural affiliations an individual in the United States may have commonly depend on social class, political orientation and a multitude of demographic characteristics such as religious background, occupation and ethnic group membership.
Regional variations.
Semi-distinct cultural regions of the United States include New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, the Southern United States, the Midwestern United States and the Western United States—an area that can be further subdivided, on the basis of the local culture into the Pacific States and the Mountain States.
The western coast of the continental United States consisting of California, Oregon, and the state of Washington is also sometimes referred to as the Left Coast, indicating its left-leaning political orientation and tendency towards social liberalism.
Southern United States are informally called "the Bible Belt" due to socially conservative evangelical Protestantism, which is a significant part of the region's culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher there than the nation's average. This region is usually contrasted with the mainline Protestantism and Catholicism of the northeastern United States, the religiously diverse Midwest and Great Lakes, the Mormon Corridor in Utah and southern Idaho, and the relatively secular western United States. The percentage of non-religious people is the highest in the northeastern state of Vermont at 34%, compared to the Bible Belt state of Alabama, where it is 6%.
Strong cultural differences have a long history in the U.S. with the southern slave society in the antebellum period serving as a prime example. Not only social, but also economic tensions between the Northern and Southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the South to declare itself an independent nation, the Confederate States of America; thus initiating the American Civil War.
Fischer's theory.
David Hackett Fischer theorizes that the United States is made up today of four distinct regional cultures. The book's focus is on the folkways of four groups of settlers from the British Isles that emigrated from distinct regions of Britain and Ireland to the British American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries. Fischer's thesis is that the culture and folkways of each of these groups persisted, albeit with some modification over time, providing the basis for the four modern regional cultures of the United States.
According to Fischer, the foundation of American culture was formed from four mass migrations from four different regions of the British Isles by four distinct socio-religious groups. New England's earliest settlement period occurred between 1629 and 1640 when Puritans, mostly from East Anglia in England, settled there, forming the New England regional culture. The next mass migration was of southern English cavaliers and their Irish and Scottish domestic servants to the Chesapeake Bay region between 1640 and 1675. This facilitated the development of the Southern American culture.
Then (between 1675 and 1725), thousands of Irish, English and German Quakers, led by William Penn, settled in the Delaware Valley. This settlement resulted in the formation of what is today considered the "General American" culture, although, according to Fischer, it is really just a regional American culture, even if it does today encompass most of the U.S. from the mid-Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast. Finally, Scotch-Irish, English and Scottish settlers from the borderlands of Britain and Ireland migrated to Appalachia between 1717 and 1775. They formed the regional culture of the Upland South, which has since spread west to such areas as West Texas and parts of the U.S. Southwest.
Fischer suggests that the U.S. today is not a country with one General American culture and three or more regional sub-cultures. He asserts that the country is composed of just regional cultures, and that understanding that helps one to understand many things about modern American life. Fischer also makes the point that the development of these regional cultures derived not only from where exactly the settlers first came, but when they came. Fischer asserts that during different periods of time, a population of people will have very distinct beliefs, fears, hopes and prejudices, and that various groups of settlers brought these feelings to the New World where they more or less froze in time in America, even if they eventually changed in their place of origin.
Woodard's Theory.
Continuing the work of Fischer, Colin Woodard, in his book American Nations, claims an existence of eleven rival regional cultures in North America, based on the cultural characteristics of the original settlers of these regions. These regions are: Yankeedom, New Netherland, The Midlands, Tidewater, Greater Appalachia, The Deep South, New France, El Norte, The Left Coast, The Far West and First Nation (a region in parts of northern Canada and Alaska, and Greenland).
According to Woodard, these regions cross and disregard formal state or even country borders. For example, he compares the Mexican border with the Berlin wall, saying that "El Norte in some ways resembles Germany during the Cold War: two peoples with a common culture separated by a large wall."
Language.
Although the United States has no official language at the federal level, 28 states have passed legislation making English the official language and it is considered to be the "de facto" national language. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 97% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home. More than 300 languages besides English have native speakers in the United States—some of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples (about 150 living languages) and others imported by immigrants.
Spanish has official status in the commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the state of New Mexico; Spanish is the primary spoken language in Puerto Rico and various smaller linguistic enclaves. According to the 2000 census, there are nearly 30 million native speakers of Spanish in the United States. Bilingual speakers may use both English and Spanish reasonably well but code-switch according to their dialog partner or context. Some refer to this phenomenon as Spanglish.
Indigenous languages of the United States include the Native American languages, which are spoken on the country’s numerous Indian reservations and Native American cultural events such as pow wows; Hawaiian, which has official status in the state of Hawaii; Chamorro, which has official status in the commonwealths of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands; Carolinian, which has official status in the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and Samoan, which has official status in the commonwealth of American Samoa. American Sign Language, used mainly by the deaf, is also native to the country.
The national dialect is known as American English, which itself consists of numerous regional dialects but has some shared unifying features that distinguish it from other national varieties of English. There are four large dialect regions in the United States—the North, the Midland, the South, and the West—and several smaller dialect regions such as those of New York City and Boston. A standard dialect called "General American" (analogous in some respects to the received pronunciation elsewhere in the English-speaking world), lacking the distinctive noticeable features of any particular region, is believed by some to exist as well; it is sometimes regionally associated with the vaguely-defined "Midwest".
Native language statistics for the United States.
The following information is an estimation as actual statistics constantly vary.
According to the CIA, the following is the percentage of total population's native languages in the United States:
Literature.
The right to freedom of expression in the American constitution can be traced to German immigrant John Peter Zenger and his legal fight to make truthful publications in the Colonies a protected legal right, ultimately paving the way for the protected rights of American authors.
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition.
America's first internationally popular writers were James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving in the early nineteenth century. They painted an American literary landscape full of humor and adventure. These were followed by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Henry David Thoreau who established a distinctive American literary voice in the middle of the nineteenth century.
Mark Twain, Henry James, and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, would be recognized as America's other essential poet. Eleven U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, including John Steinbeck, William Faulkner, Eugene O'Neill, Pearl S. Buck, T. S. Eliot and Sinclair Lewis. Ernest Hemingway, the 1954 Nobel laureate, is often named as one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century.
A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick" (1851), Twain's "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" (1885), and F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" (1925)—may be dubbed the "Great American Novel". Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction were developed in the United States.
Fine arts.
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American artists primarily painted landscapes and portraits in a realistic style. A parallel development taking shape in rural America was the American craft movement, which began as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution. Developments in modern art in Europe came to America from exhibitions in New York City such as the Armory Show in 1913. After World War II, New York emerged as a center of the art world. Painting in the United States today covers a vast range of styles. American painting includes works by Jackson Pollock, John Singer Sargent, and Norman Rockwell, among many others.
Architecture.
Architecture in the United States is regionally diverse and has been shaped by many external forces, not only English. U.S. architecture can therefore be said to be eclectic, something unsurprising in such a multicultural society. In the absence of a single large-scale architectural influence from indigenous peoples such as those in Mexico or Peru, generations of designers have incorporated influences from around the world. Currently, the overriding theme of American Architecture is modernity, as manifest in the skyscrapers of the 20th century.
Early Neoclassicism accompanied the Founding Father's idealization of European Enlightenment, making it the predominant architectural style for public buildings and large manors. However, in recent years, suburbanization and mass migration to the Sun Belt has allowed architecture to reflect a Mediterranean style as well.##
Theater.
Theater of the United States is based in the Western tradition and did not take on a unique dramatic identity until the emergence of Eugene O'Neill in the early twentieth century, now considered by many to be the father of American drama. O'Neill is a four-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the only American playwright to win the Nobel Prize for literature. After O'Neill, American drama came of age and flourished with the likes of Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Lillian Hellman, William Inge, and Clifford Odets during the first half of the twentieth century. After this fertile period, American theater broke new ground, artistically, with the absurdist forms of Edward Albee in the 1960s.
Social commentary has also been a preoccupation of American theater, often addressing issues not discussed in the mainstream. Writers such as Lorraine Hansbury, August Wilson, David Mamet and Tony Kushner have all won Pulitzer Prizes for their polemical plays on American society. The United States is also the home and largest exporter of modern musical theater, producing such musical talents as Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein, George and Ira Gershwin, Kander and Ebb, and Stephen Sondheim. Broadway is one of the largest theater communities in the world and is the epicenter of American commercial theater.
Dance.
The United States is represented by various genres of dance, from ballet to hip-hop.
Music.
American music styles and influences (such as country, jazz, rock and roll, rock, hip-hop, rap) and music based on them can be heard all over the world. Music in the U.S. is diverse. It includes African-American influence in the 20th century. The first half of this century is famous for jazz, introduced by African-Americans in the south. In the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, rock was prevalent.
Cinema.
The cinema of the United States, often generally referred to as Hollywood, has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early twentieth century. Its history can be separated into four main periods: the silent film era, classical Hollywood cinema, New Hollywood, and the contemporary period. While the Lumiere Brothers are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema, it is American cinema that has emerged as the most dominant force in the industry.
American independent cinema was revitalized in the late 1980s and early 1990s when another new generation of moviemakers, including Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh, Kevin Smith, and Quentin Tarantino made movies like, respectively: "Do the Right Thing"; "Sex, Lies, and Videotape"; "Clerks"; and "Reservoir Dogs". In terms of directing, screenwriting, editing, and other elements, these movies were innovative and often irreverent, playing with and contradicting the conventions of Hollywood movies. Furthermore, their considerable financial successes and crossover into popular culture reestablished the commercial viability of independent film. Since then, the independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more influential in American cinema. Many of the major studios have capitalized on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar films; for example Fox Searchlight Pictures.
To a lesser degree in the early 21st century, film types that were previously considered to have only a minor presence in the mainstream movie market began to arise as more potent American box office draws. These include foreign-language films such as "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Hero" and documentary films such as "Super Size Me", "March of the Penguins", and Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" and "Fahrenheit 9/11".
Science and technology.
There is a regard for scientific advancement and technological innovation in American culture, resulting in the flow of many modern innovations. The great American inventors include Robert Fulton (the steamboat); Samuel Morse (the telegraph); Eli Whitney (the cotton gin, interchangeable parts); Cyrus McCormick (the reaper); and Thomas Edison (with more than a thousand inventions credited to his name). Most of the new technological innovations over the 20th and 21st centuries were either first invented in the United States and/or first widely adopted by Americans. Examples include the lightbulb, the airplane, the transistor, the atomic bomb, nuclear power, the personal computer, the iPod, video games and online shopping, as well as the development of the Internet.
This propensity for application of scientific ideas continued throughout the 20th century with innovations that held strong international benefits. The twentieth century saw the arrival of the Space Age, the Information Age, and a renaissance in the health sciences. This culminated in cultural milestones such as the Apollo moon landings, the creation of the Personal Computer, and the sequencing effort called the Human Genome Project.
Throughout its history, American culture has made significant gains through the open immigration of accomplished scientists. Accomplished scientists include: Scottish-American scientist Alexander Graham Bell, who developed and patented the telephone and other devices; German scientist Charles Steinmetz, who developed new alternating-current electrical systems in 1889; Russian scientist Vladimir Zworykin, who invented the motion camera in 1919; Serb scientist Nikola Tesla who patented a brushless electrical induction motor based on rotating magnetic fields in 1888. With the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, a large number of Jewish scientists fled Germany and immigrated to the country, one of them being a Jewish theoretical physicist Albert Einstein in the year 1933.
In the years during and following WWII, several innovative scientists immigrated to the U.S. from Europe, such as Enrico Fermi, who came from Italy in 1938 and led the work that produced the world's first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Post-war Europe saw many of its scientists, such as rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, recruited by the United States as part of Operation Paperclip.
Education.
Education in the United States is and has historically been provided mainly by government, with control and funding coming from three levels: federal, state, and local. School attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels (often known outside the United States as the primary and secondary levels).
Students have the options of having their education held in public schools, private schools, or home school. In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: elementary school, junior high school (also often called middle school), and high school. In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into grades. Post-secondary education, better known as "college" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system.
In the year 2000, there were 76.6 million students enrolled in schools from kindergarten through graduate schools. Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically "on track" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade level). Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2 million (10.4 percent) were attending private schools. Among the country's adult population, over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a bachelor's degree or higher.
Religion.
Among developed countries, the U.S. is one of the most religious in terms of its demographics. According to a 2002 study by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, the U.S. was the only developed nation in the survey where a majority of citizens reported that religion played a "very important" role in their lives, an opinion similar to that found in Latin America. Today, governments at the national, state, and local levels are a secular institution, with what is often called the "separation of church and state". But like federal politics, the topic of religion in the United States can cause an emotionally heated debate over moral, ethical and legal issues affecting Americans of all faiths in everyday life, such as polarizing issues of abortion, gay marriage and obscenity.
Although participation in organized religion has been diminishing, the public life and popular culture of the United States incorporates many Christian ideals specifically about redemption, salvation, conscience, and morality. Examples are popular culture obsessions with confession and forgiveness, which extends from reality television to twelve-step meetings. Americans expect public figures to confess and have public penitence for any sins, or moral wrongdoings they may have caused. According to "Salon", examples of inadequate public penitence may include the scandals and fallout regarding Tiger Woods, Alex Rodriguez, Mel Gibson, Larry Craig, and Lance Armstrong.
Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by English and Irish settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination or persecution: Pennsylvania was established by Quakers, Maryland by Roman Catholics, and the Massachusetts Bay Colony by Puritans. Separatist Congregationalists (Pilgrim Fathers) founded Plymouth Colony in 1620. They were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God. They and the other Protestant groups applied the representative democratic organisation of their congregations also to the administration of their communities in wordly matters. Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania added religious freedom to their democratic constitutions, becoming safe havens for persecuted religious minorities. The first Bible printed in a European language in the Colonies was by German immigrant Christopher Sauer. Nine of the thirteen colonies had official public religions. By the time of the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, the United States became one of the first countries in the world to codify freedom of religion into law, although this originally applied only to the federal government, and not to state governments or their political subdivisions.
Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the framers of the United States Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the central government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion, or prohibiting its free exercise. In following decades, the animating spirit behind the constitution's Establishment Clause led to the disestablishment of the official religions within the member states. The framers were mainly influenced by secular, Enlightenment ideals, but they also considered the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups who did not want to be under the power or influence of a state religion that did not represent them. Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence said: "The priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot."
Statistics.
The following information is an estimation as actual statistics constantly vary. According to the CIA, the following is the percentage of followers of different religions in the United States:
National holidays.
The United States observes holidays derived from events in American history, Christian traditions, and national patriarchs.
Thanksgiving is the principal traditionally American holiday. It evolved from the English Pilgrim's custom of giving thanks for one's welfare. Thanksgiving is generally celebrated as a family reunion with a large afternoon feast. Christmas Day, celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, is widely celebrated and a federal holiday, though a fair amount of its current cultural importance is due to secular reasons. European colonization has led to some other Christian holidays such as Easter, Lent and St. Patrick’s Day to be observed, though with varying degrees of religious fidelity.
Independence Day (also known as the Fourth of July) celebrates the anniversary of the country’s Declaration of Independence from Great Britain. It is generally observed by parades throughout the day and the shooting of fireworks at night.
Halloween is thought to have evolved from the ancient Celtic/Gaelic festival of Samhain, which was introduced in the American colonies by Irish settlers. It has become a holiday that is celebrated by children and teens who traditionally dress up in costumes and go door to door trick-or-treating for candy. It also brings about an emphasis on eerie and frightening urban legends and movies.
Additionally, Mardi Gras, which evolved from the Catholic tradition of Carnival, is observed notably in New Orleans, St. Louis, and Mobile, Alabama as well as numerous other towns.
Federally recognized holidays are as follows:
Fashion and dress.
Fashion in the United States is eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, particularly those of recent immigrants, cowboy hats and boots and leather motorcycle jackets are emblematic of specifically American styles.
Blue jeans were popularized as work clothes in the 1850s by merchant Levi Strauss, a German-Jewish immigrant in San Francisco, and adopted by many American teenagers a century later. They are worn in every state by people of all ages and social classes. Along with mass-marketed informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably one of US culture's primary contributions to global fashion.
Though informal dress is more common, certain professionals, such as bankers and lawyers, traditionally dress formally for work, and some occasions, such as weddings, funerals, dances, and some parties, typically call for formal wear.
Sports.
Baseball is the oldest of the major American team sports. Professional baseball dates from 1869 and had no close rivals in popularity until the 1960s. Though baseball is no longer the most popular sport, it is still referred to as "the national sport". Also unlike the professional levels of the other popular spectator sports in the U.S., Major League Baseball teams play almost every day. The Major League Baseball regular season consists of each of the 30 teams playing 162 games from April to September. The season ends with the postseason and World Series in October.
American football, known in the United States as simply "football", now attracts more television viewers than any other sport and is considered to be the most popular sport in the United States. The 32-team National Football League (NFL) is the most popular professional American football league.
The National Football League differs from the other three major pro sports leagues in that each of its 32 teams plays one game a week over 17 weeks, for a total of 16 games with one bye week for each team. The NFL season lasts from September to December, ending with the playoffs and Super Bowl in January and February.
Its championship game, the Super Bowl, has often been the highest rated television show, with an audience of over 100 million viewers annually.
College football also attracts audiences of millions. Some communities, particularly in rural areas, place great emphasis on their local high school football team. American football games usually include cheerleaders and marching bands, which aim to raise school spirit and entertain the crowd at half-time.
Basketball is another major sport, represented professionally by the National Basketball Association. It was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1891, by Canadian-born physical education teacher James Naismith. College basketball is also popular, due in large part to the NCAA men's Division I basketball tournament in March, also known as March Madness.
Ice hockey is the fourth leading professional team sport. Always a mainstay of Great Lakes and New England-area culture, the sport gained tenuous footholds in regions like the American South since the early 1990s, as the National Hockey League pursued a policy of expansion.
Lacrosse is a team sport of American and Canadian Native American origin, it's the fastest growing sport in the United States. Lacrosse is most popular in the East Coast area. NLL and MLL are the national box and outdoor lacrosse leagues, respectively, and have increased their following in recent years. Also, many of the top Division I college lacrosse teams draw upwards of 7–10,000 for a game, especially in the Mid-Atlantic and New England areas.
The sport called "football" in many countries is typically called soccer in the United States. A nineteen-team professional league, Major League Soccer, plays from March to October, but its television audience and overall popularity lag behind other American professional sports. However, soccer is very popular as a participation sport, particularly among youths, and the US national soccer teams are competitive internationally.
Boxing and horse racing were once the most watched individual sports, but they have been eclipsed by golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR. Other popular sports are tennis, softball, rodeo, swimming, water polo, fencing, shooting sports, hunting, volleyball, skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding, cycling, MMA, wrestling, weightlifting and rugby.
The United States is unusually competitive in women's sports, a fact usually attributed to the Title IX antidiscrimination law, which requires most American colleges to give equal funding to men's and women's sports. Despite that, however, women's sports are not nearly as popular among spectators as men's sports.
The United States enjoys a great deal of success both in the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, constantly being ranked in the top rankings.
Sports and community culture.
Homecoming is an annual tradition of the United States. People, towns, high schools and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back former residents and alumni. It is built around a central event, such as a banquet, a parade, and most often, a game of American football, or, on occasion, basketball, wrestling or ice hockey. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary. However, they usually consist of a football game, played on the school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a parade featuring the school's marching band and sports teams, and the coronation of a Homecoming Queen.
American high schools commonly field football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer, golf, swimming, track and field, and cross-country teams as well.
Cuisine.
The cuisine of the United States is extremely diverse, owing to the vastness of the continent, the relatively large population (1/3 of a billion people) and the number of native and immigrant influences. Mainstream American culinary arts are similar to those in other Western countries. Wheat and corn are the primary cereal grains. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as turkey, white-tailed deer venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup, indigenous foods employed by American Indians and early European settlers. Slow-cooked pork and beef barbecue, crab cakes, potato chips, cotton candy and chocolate chip cookies are distinctively American styles.
The types of food served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the family's own cultural heritage. Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin, and Americanized versions of these cultural foods, such as American Chinese cuisine, Tex-Mex (Mexican-American cuisine) or Italian-American cuisine often eventually appear; an example is Vietnamese cuisine, Korean cuisine and Thai cuisine. German cuisine has a profound impact on American cuisine, especially mid-western cuisine, with potatoes, noodles, roasts, stews and cakes/pastries being the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines. Dishes such as the hamburger, pot roast, baked ham and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived from German cuisine.
Different regions of the United States have their own cuisine and styles of cooking. The state of Louisiana, for example, is known for its Cajun and Creole cooking. Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French, Acadian, and Haitian cooking, although the dishes themselves are original and unique. Examples include Crawfish Etouffee, Red Beans and Rice, Seafood or Chicken Gumbo, Jambalaya, and Boudin. Italian, German, Hungarian and Chinese influences, traditional Native American, Caribbean, Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire. It is not uncommon for a "middle-class" family from "middle America" to eat, for example, restaurant pizza, home-made pizza, enchiladas con carne, chicken paprikas, beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week.
Soul food, developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere. Syncretic cuisines such as Louisiana creole, Cajun, Pennsylvania Dutch, and Tex-Mex are regionally important. Iconic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants and domestic innovations. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are consumed.
Americans generally prefer coffee to tea, with more than half the adult population drinking at least one cup a day. Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk (now often fat-reduced) ubiquitous breakfast beverages. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%; frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what health officials call the American "obesity epidemic." Highly sweetened soft drinks are popular; sugared beverages account for 9% of the average American's daily caloric intake.
Hamburgers and fries, as well as doughnuts are considered American foods.
Some representative American foods
Family structure.
Family arrangements in the United States reflect the nature of contemporary American society, as they always have. Although the nuclear family concept (two-married adults with biological children) holds a special place in the mindset of Americans, it is single-parent families, childless/childfree couples, and fused families which now constitute the majority of families. A person may grow up in a single-parent family, go on to marry and live in childless couple arrangement, then get divorced, live as a single for a couple of years, re-marry, have children and live in a nuclear family arrangement.
"The nuclear family... is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of "family..." The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). Thus has arisen the term "postmodern family", which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and child-free couples."- Brian K. Williams, Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom, "Marriages, Families & Intinamte Relationships", 2005.
Single-parent households are households consisting of a single adult (most often a woman) and one or more children. In the single-parent household, one parent typically raises the children with little to no help from the other. This parent is the sole "breadwinner" of the family and thus these households are particularly vulnerable economically. They have higher rates of poverty, and children of these households are more likely to have educational problems.
Youth Dependence.
Other changes to the landscape of American family arrangements include dual-income earner households and delayed independence among American youths. Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income earner, most commonly the husband, the vast majority of family households now have two-income earners.
Another change is the increasing age at which young Americans leave their parental home. Traditionally, a person past "college age" who lived with their parent(s) was viewed negatively, but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid-twenties. This trend can be mostly attributed to rising living costs that far exceed those in decades past. Thus, many young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid-20s. This topic was a cover article of TIME magazine in 2005.
Exceptions to the custom of leaving home in one's mid-20s can occur especially among Italian and Hispanic Americans, and in expensive urban real estate markets such as New York City, California, and Honolulu, where monthly rents commonly exceed $1000 a month.
Housing.
Historically, Americans mainly lived rural lives, with a few important cities of moderate size. Following World War II, however, Americans began living in increasing numbers in the suburbs, belts around major cities with higher density than rural areas, but much lower than urban areas. This move has been attributed to many factors such as the automobile, the availability of large tracts of land, the convenience of more and longer paved roads, increasing violence in urban centers (see white flight), and the lower expense of housing.
These new single-family houses were usually one or two stories tall, and often were part of large contracts of homes built by a single developer and often with little variation (sometimes referred to as cookie cutter houses or homes). Houses were separated. The resulting low-density development was given the pejorative label urban sprawl.
This has changed; white flight has reversed, with Yuppies and upper-middle-class, empty nest Baby Boomers returning to urban living, usually in condominia, such as in New York City's Lower East Side, Chicago's South Loop and Miami's Brickell Neighborhood. The result has been the displacement of many poorer, inner-city residents.
American cities with housing prices near the national median have also been losing the middle income neighborhoods, those with median income between 80% and 120% of the metropolitan area's median household income. Here, the more affluent members of the middle class, who are also often referred to as being professional or upper middle class, have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs. This trend is largely attributed to the "Middle-class squeeze", which has caused a starker distinction between the statistical middle class and the more privileged members of the middle class. In more expensive areas such as California, however, another trend has been taking place where an influx of more affluent middle-class households has displaced those in the actual middle of society and converted former middle-middle-class neighborhoods into upper-middle-class neighborhoods.
The population of rural areas has been declining over time as more and more people migrate to cities for work and entertainment. The great exodus from the farms came in the 1940s; in recent years fewer than 2% of the population lives on farms (though others live in the countryside and commute to work). Electricity and telephone, and sometimes cable and Internet services are available to all but the most remote regions.
About half of Americans now live in what is known as the suburbs. The suburban nuclear family has been identified as part of the "American Dream": a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs. This archetype is reinforced by mass media, religious practices, and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo-Saxon cultures. One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living is the housing occupied by the families. The suburbs are filled with single-family homes separated from retail districts, industrial areas, and sometimes even public schools. However, many American suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales, attracting more people to these communities.
Housing in urban areas may include more apartments and semi-attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns. Aside from housing, the major difference from suburban living is the density and diversity of many different subcultures, as well as retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing in urban areas.
Automobiles and commuting.
Due to the low overall population density as well as urban sprawl, the United States is one of the few developed nations where most people commute by car.
The rise of suburbs and the need for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularization of automobiles. In 2001, 90% of Americans drove to work in cars. Lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large, powerful cars. The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with motels and drive-in restaurants. Americans tend to view obtaining a driver's license as a rite of passage. Outside of relatively few urban areas, it is considered a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars. New York City is the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car.
Social class and work.
Though most Americans in the 21st century identify themselves as middle class, American society and its culture are considerably fragmented. Social class, generally described as a combination of educational attainment, income and occupational prestige, is one of the greatest cultural influences in America. Nearly all cultural aspects of mundane interactions and consumer behavior in the U.S. are guided by a person's location within the country's social structure.
Distinct lifestyles, consumption patterns and values are associated with different classes. Early sociologist-economist Thorstein Veblen, for example, noted that those at the very top of the social ladder engage in conspicuous leisure as well as conspicuous consumption. Upper-middle-class persons commonly identify education and being cultured as prime values. Persons in this particular social class tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority, knowledge and thus credibility. They often tend to engage in the consumption of so-called mass luxuries, such as designer label clothing. A strong preference for natural materials and organic foods as well as a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the upper middle class. American middle-class individuals in general value expanding one's horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels. Working-class individuals take great pride in doing what they consider to be "real work," and keep very close-knit kin networks that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability.
Working-class Americans as well as many of those in the middle class may also face occupation alienation. In contrast to upper-middle-class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize, supervise and share their thoughts, many Americans have little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace. As a result white collar professionals tend to be significantly more satisfied with their work. More recently those in the center of the income strata, who may still identify as middle class, have faced increasing economic insecurity, supporting the idea of a working-class majority.
Political behavior is affected by class; more affluent individuals are more likely to vote, and education and income affect whether individuals tend to vote for the Democratic or Republican party. Income also had a significant impact on health as those with higher incomes had better access to health care facilities, higher life expectancy, lower infant mortality rate and increased health consciousness. This is particularly noticeable with black voters who are often socially conservative, yet overwhelmingly vote Democratic.
In the United States occupation is one of the prime factors of social class and is closely linked to an individual’s identity. The average work week in the U.S. for those employed full-time was 42.9 hours long with 30% of the population working more than 40 hours a week. The Average American worker earned $16.64 an hour in the first two quarters of 2006. Overall Americans worked more than their counterparts in other developed post-industrial nations. While the average worker in Denmark enjoyed 30 days of vacation annually, the average American had 16 annual vacation days.
In 2000 the average American worked 1,978 hours per year, 500 hours more than the average German, yet 100 hours less than the average Czech. Overall the U.S. labor force is one of the most productive in the world, largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post-industrial country (excluding South Korea). Americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard; being busy and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem.
Race and ancestry.
Race in the United States is based on physical characteristics and skin color and has played an essential part in shaping American society even before the nation's conception. Until the civil rights movement of the 1960s, racial minorities in the United States faced institutionalized discrimination and social as well as economic marginalization. Today the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census recognizes four races, Native American or American Indian, African American, Asian and White (European American). According to the U.S. government, Hispanic Americans do not constitute a race, but rather an ethnic group. During the 2000 U.S. Census Whites made up 75.1% of the population with those being Hispanic or Latino constituting the nation's prevalent minority with 12.5% of the population. African Americans made up 12.3% of the total population, 3.6% were Asian American and 0.7% were Native American.
The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution—ratified on Dec 6, 1865—abolished slavery in the United States. The northern states had outlawed slavery in their territory in the late 18th and early 19th century, though their industrial economies relied on raw materials produced by slaves. Following the Reconstruction period in the 1870s, an apartheid regulation emerged in the Southern states named the Jim Crow laws that provided for legal segregation. Lynching was practiced throughout the U.S., including in the Northern states, until the 1930s, while continuing well into the civil rights movement in the South.
Chinese Americans were earlier marginalized as well during a significant proportion of U.S. history. Between 1882 and 1943 the United States instituted the Chinese Exclusion Act barring Chinese immigrants from entering the U.S. During the second world war roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans, 62% of whom were U.S. citizens, were imprisoned in Japanese internment camps by the U.S. government following the attacks on Pearl Harbor, an American Military Base, by Japanese troops.
Due to exclusion from or marginalization by earlier mainstream society, there emerged a unique sub-culture among the racial minorities in the United States. During the 1920s, Harlem, New York became home to the Harlem Renaissance. Music styles such as Jazz, Blues, Rap, Rock and roll as well as numerous folk-songs such as Blue Tail Fly (Jimmy Crack Corn) originated within the realms of African American culture, and was later on adopted by the mainstream. Chinatowns can be found in many cities across the country and Asian cuisine has become a common staple in mainstream America. The Hispanic community has also had a dramatic impact on American culture. Today, Catholics are the largest religious denomination in the United States and out-number Protestants in the South-west and California. Mariachi music and Mexican cuisine are commonly found throughout the Southwest, with some Latin dishes, such as burritos and tacos, found anywhere in the nation.
Economic variance and substantive segregation, is commonplace in the United States. Asian Americans have median household income and educational attainment exceeding that of other races. African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans have considerably lower income and education than do White Americans or Asian Americans. In 2005 the median household income of Whites was 62.5% higher than that of African American, nearly one-quarter of whom live below the poverty line. 46.9% of homicide victims in the United States are African American.
After the attacks by Muslim terrorists on September 11, 2001, discrimination against Arabs and Muslims in the U.S. rose significantly. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) reported an increase in hate speech, cases of airline discrimination, hate crimes, police misconduct as well as racial profiling.
Death and funerals.
It is customary for Americans to hold a wake in a funeral home within a couple days of the death of a loved one. The body of the deceased may be embalmed and dressed in fine clothing if there will be an open-casket viewing. Traditional Jewish and Muslim practice include a ritual bath and no embalming. Friends, relatives and acquaintances gather, often from distant parts of the country, to "pay their last respects" to the deceased. Flowers are brought to the coffin and sometimes eulogies, elegies, personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited. Otherwise, the attendees sit, stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer. Kissing the corpse on the forehead is typical among Italian Americans and others. Condolences are also offered to the widow or widower and other close relatives.
A funeral may be held immediately afterwards or the next day. The funeral ceremony varies according to religion and culture. American Catholics typically hold a funeral mass in a church, which sometimes takes the form of a Requiem mass. Jewish Americans may hold a service in a synagogue or temple. Pallbearers carry the coffin of the deceased to the hearse, which then proceeds in a procession to the place of final repose, usually a cemetery. The unique Jazz funeral of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession.
Mount Auburn Cemetery (founded in 1831) is known as "America's first garden cemetery." American cemeteries created since are distinctive for their park-like setting. Rows of graves are covered by lawns and are interspersed with trees and flowers. Headstones, mausoleums, statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves. Cremation is another common practice in the United States, though it is frowned upon by various religions. The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an urn, which may be kept in a private house, or they are interred. Sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere. The "sprinkling" or "scattering" of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony, often taking place at a scenic natural feature (a cliff, lake or mountain) that was favored by the deceased.
A so-called death industry has developed in the United States that has replaced earlier, more informal traditions. Before the popularity of funeral homes, people usually held wakes in the Parlour rooms of private houses.
Sociological issues.
Marriage and divorce.
Marriage laws are established by individual states. The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister, priest, or rabbi, depending upon the faith of the couple. In traditional Christian ceremonies, the bride's father will "give away" (hand off) the bride to the groom. Secular weddings are also common, often presided over by a judge, Justice of the Peace, or other municipal official. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in several states; others offer domestic partnerships. Polygamy is universally banned.
Divorce is the province of state governments, so divorce law varies from state to state. Prior to the 1970s, divorcing spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or sin like abandonment or adultery; when spouses simply could not get along, lawyers were forced to manufacture "uncontested" divorces. The no-fault divorce revolution began in 1969 in California; New York and South Dakota were the last states to begin allowing no-fault divorce. No-fault divorce on the grounds of "irreconcilable differences" is now available in all states. However, many states have recently required separation periods prior to a formal divorce decree.
State law provides for child support where children are involved, and sometimes for alimony. "Married adults now divorce two-and-a-half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and four times as often as they did 50 years ago... between 40% and 60% of "new" marriages will eventually end in divorce. The probability within... the first five years is 20%, and the probability of its ending within the first 10 years is 33%... Perhaps 25% of children ages 16 and under live with a stepparent." The median length for a marriage in the U.S. today is 11 years with 90% of all divorces being settled out of court.
Race relations.
White Americans (non-Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino) are the racial majority, with a 72% share of the U.S. population, according to the 2010 US Census. Hispanic and Latino Americans comprise 15% of the population, making up the largest ethnic minority. Black Americans are the largest racial minority, comprising nearly 13% of the population. The White, non-Hispanic or Latino population comprises 63% of the nation's total.
Throughout most of the country's history following independence from Great Britain, the majority race in the United States has been Caucasian, and the largest racial minority has been African-Americans. This relationship has historically been the most important one since the founding of the United States. Currently, most African-Americans are descendants of African slaves imported to the United States, though some are more recent immigrants or their descendants. Slavery existed in the United States at the time of the country's formation in the 1770s. The U.S. banned importation of slaves in 1808. Slavery was partially abolished by the Emancipation Proclamation issued by president Abraham Lincoln in 1862 for slaves in the Southeastern United States during the Civil War. Slavery was rendered illegal by the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Jim Crow Laws prevented full use of African American citizenship until the 20th century. The Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed official or legal segregation in public places or limited access to minorities.
Relations between white Americans and other racial or ethnic groups have been a source of tension at various times in U.S. history. With the advent of European colonization, and continuing into the early years of the republic, relations between whites and Native American was a significant issue. In 1882, in response to Chinese immigration due to the Gold Rush and the labor needed for the Transcontinental Railroad, the U.S. signed into law the Chinese Exclusion Act which banned immigration by Chinese people into the U.S. In the late 20th century, the growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S., fueled largely by Mexican immigration, generated debate over policies such as English as the official language and reform to immigration policies.
A huge majority of Americans of all races disapprove of racism. Nevertheless, some Americans continue to hold negative racial/ethnic stereotypes about various racial and ethnic groups. Professor Imani Perry, of Princeton University, has argued that contemporary racism in the United States "is frequently unintentional or unacknowledged on the part of the actor”, believing that racism mostly stems unconsciously from below the level of cognition.
Drugs and alcohol.
American attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country's history. In the 19th century, alcohol was readily available and consumed, and no laws restricted the use of other drugs. Attitudes on drug addiction started to change, resulting in the Harrison Act, which eventually became proscriptive.
A movement to ban alcoholic beverages, called the Temperance movement, emerged in the late 19th century. Several American Protestant religious groups, as well as women's groups such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union, supported the movement. In 1919, Prohibitionists succeeded in amending the Constitution to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall, banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs that trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition was repealed in 1933. States and localities retained the right to remain "dry", and to this day, a handful still do.
During the Vietnam War era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an 18-year-old could be drafted to war but could not buy a beer.
Since 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was the first state to enact tough drunk-driving laws in 1980; since then all other states have followed suit. All states have also banned the purchase of alcoholic beverages by individuals under 21.
A "Just Say No to Drugs" movement replaced the more liberal ethos of the 1960s. This led to stricter drug laws and greater police latitude in drug cases. Drugs are, however, widely available, and 16% of Americans 12 and older used an illicit drug in 2012.
Since the 1990s, marijuana use has become increasingly tolerated in America, with a number of states allowing the use of marijuana for medical purposes. In most states marijuana is still illegal without medical prescription. In the 2012 general election, voters in the states of Colorado and Washington approved the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. Marijuana is classified as illegal under federal law.
Group affiliations.
As the United States is a diverse nation, there are numerous organizations and social groups, and individuals may derive their group affiliated identity from a variety of sources. Many Americans, especially white collar professionals belong to professional organizations such as the APA, ASA or ATFLC, although books like Bowling Alone indicate that Americans affiliate with these sorts of groups less often than they did in the 1950s and 1960s. Today, Americans derive a great deal of their identity through their work and professional affiliation, especially among individuals higher on the economic ladder. Recently professional identification has led to many clerical and low-level employees giving their occupations new, more respectable titles, such as "Sanitation service engineer" instead of "Janitor."
Additionally many Americans belong to non-profit organizations and religious establishments and may volunteer their services to such organizations. Rotary International, the Knights of Columbus or even the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are examples of such non-profit and mostly volunteer-run organizations. Ethnicity plays another important role in providing some Americans with group identity, especially among those who recently immigrated.
Many American cities are home to ethnic enclaves such as a Chinatown and Little Italies. Local patriotism may be also provide group identity. For example, a person may be particularly proud to be from California or New York City, and may display clothing from local sports team.
Political lobbies such as the AARP, ADL, NAACP, NOW and GLAAD (examples being civil rights activist organizations) not only provide individuals with a sentiment of intra-group allegiance but also increase their political representation in the nation's political system. Combined, profession, ethnicity, religious, and other group affiliations have provided Americans with a multitude of options to derive group based identity from.
Volunteerism.
De Tocqueville first noted, in 1835, the American attitude towards helping others in need. A 2011 Charities Aid Foundation study found that Americans were the first most willing to help a stranger and donate time and money in the world at 60%. Many low-level crimes are punished by assigning hours of "community service", a requirement that the offender perform volunteer work; some high schools also require community service to graduate. Since US citizens are required to attend jury duty, they can be jurors in legal proceedings.
Military culture.
From the time of its inception the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged out of the victorious First Barbary War and Second Barbary War, as well as the War of 1812. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the onset of the Cold War, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.
The U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel. It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid volunteers; although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972. As of 2011, the United States spends about $550 billion annually to fund its military forces, and appropriates approximately $160 billion to fund Overseas Contingency Operations. Put together, the United States constitutes roughly 43 percent of the world's military expenditures. The U.S. armed forces as a whole possess large quantities of advanced and powerful equipment, along with widespread placement of forces around the world, giving them significant capabilities in both defense and power projection.
There is and has been a strong military culture among those on active duty, those not on active duty, as well as veterans.
Gun culture.
In sharp contrast to most other developed nations, firearms laws in the United States are permissive and private gun ownership is common, with just under half of American households containing at least one firearm. In fact, there are more privately owned firearms in the United States than in any other country, both "per capita" and in total. Rates of gun ownership vary significantly by region and by state, with gun ownership most common in Alaska, the Frontier Strip, the Mountain States and the South, and least prevalent in Hawaii, the island territories, California, the Northeast megalopolis. Gun ownership tends to be more common in rural than in urban areas.
Hunting, plinking and target shooting are popular pastimes, although ownership of firearms for purely utilitarian purposes such as personal protection is common as well. In fact, personal protection was the most common reason given for gun ownership in a 2013 Gallup poll of gun owners, at 60%. Ownership of handguns, while not uncommon, is less common than ownership of long guns. Gun ownership is considerably more prevalent among men than among women, with men being approximately four times more likely than women to report owning guns.
Other aspects.
In the federal government of the United States, responsibilities that are usually in a cultural minister's portfolio elsewhere are divided among the Federal Communications Commission, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the U.S. Department of State, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the National Gallery of Art. However, many state and city governments have a department dedicated to cultural affairs.
Influence.
The Hollywood cinema industry has been very influential on American culture, and to some extent in global culture through transmission of American movies overseas and as other film cultures like Bollywood have striven to emulate the American model.
The United States has influenced the cultures of many other countries, but as countries around the world become more inter-connected and inter-dependent, the general cultural trends (of the US and other countries) head towards multiculturalism and sociocultural globalization.

Imageboard

An imageboard or image board is a type of Internet forum which operates mostly via posting images. The first imageboards were created in Japan, and many English language imageboards today are centered on Japanese culture. They are based on the textboard concept.
Characteristics.
Imageboards, similar to bulletin board systems, are used for discussions of a variety of topics. The primary focus of imageboards, however, is directed away from text posts, and is instead placed on picture posts. The two share many of the same structures, including separate forums for separate topics, as well as similar audiences. Imageboards are much more transitory with content—on some boards (especially highly trafficked ones), the thread deletion time can be as little as 10 minutes. The most popular English language imageboard 4chan tends to revolve around Japanese culture such as CG artwork or anime. In Japan, where imageboards are more common, topics vary widely, ranging from trains to current news.
Imageboards are also different from online galleries in that most of the works posted are not made by the poster, but instead are taken from other online sources: galleries, other imageboards, and edited pictures.
Tripcodes.
Most imageboards and 2channel-style discussion boards allow (and encourage) anonymous posting and use a system of tripcodes instead of registration. A tripcode is the hashed result of a password that allows one's identity to be recognized without storing any data about users. Entering a particular password will let one 'sign' one's posts with the tripcode generated from that password, while trying to take another user's tripcode and compute their password from it (for instance, to make posts that appear to come from a particular person) is computationally difficult. Anonymity is considered to be one of the advantages of an imageboard. Some boards have from time to time removed the ability to post with a name altogether (known as 'forced anonymous/anonymity'). However, using a tripcode on some boards, such as 4chan, is generally discouraged by the community, who prefer to remain anonymous.
"Saging".
On many imageboards, if a user wants to reply to a thread but not bump it, they can put the word "sage" (correctly pronounced though often confused as , akin to the homographic English word; Japanese: 下げ, short for 下げる "sageru", "to lower") in the e-mail field. ""Age"ing" can refer to either bumping a post or putting the word "age" (Japanese: 上げ, from 上げる "ageru", "to raise") into the e-mail field. Sage is used by some board users generally to signify a bad thread.
Software.
There are two primary types of imageboard software packages in widespread use: linearly directed imageboards modeled closely after Futaba Channel (in which content is posted through hierarchical subsections of topical interest, usually denoted by a forward slash such as "/f" for female), and nonlinear imageboards modeled after Danbooru (usually indicated by the usage of controlled folksonomic vocabulary for topical tagging and search).
Futaba Channel clones.
There are currently several Futaba-based imageboard software packages in widespread use: "Futallaby", "Wakaba", "Kusaba X".
"Futallaby" is a PHP script based on the Futaba script from Futaba Channel. Although the Futallaby source is still freely available at 1chan, it is no longer in development, and the download page recommends using Wakaba instead, stating that "Wakaba can do everything Futallaby does and so much more." Futallaby started as a translation of Futaba, later retooled to support XHTML and customizable CSS styles. It is mostly notable for being the first open source English imageboard script.
"Wakaba" is a Perl imageboard script with a SQL backend to store thread information. It is designed to be more efficient and cleanly written than other scripts that are available, while preserving the same kind of functionality. Wakaba is one of most popular western imageboard software scripts, used most notably by iichan ("Wakachan"). Because of its focus on bare-bones functionality, Wakaba lacks many of the modern amenities provided by 4chan's Yotsuba, and newer imageboard scripts such as Tinyboard. A few users have attempted to remedy this by forking the original project and adding in features they consider beneficial. Two FOSS examples of this are frankusr's Wakaba fork, and the user experience focused "Glaukaba".
"kusaba" was a modular imageboard software written in PHP, which used MySQL. The creator has discontinued the project, however, and recommends TinyIB instead.
"Kusaba X" is a continuation of kusaba. Like Kusaba, Kusaba X is written in PHP, and is designed with modularity in mind. It requires a MySQL or SQLite database to run. kusaba and its derivatives were at one time some of the most popular imageboard solutions. Kusaba X is still in development and the developers state that version 1.0.0 is to be released soon.
Danbooru-style boards.
Unlike Futaba-inspired imageboard software packages, Danbooru and derivatives aim for a non-hierarchical semantic structure in which users are able to post content and add tags, annotations, translations, and comments.
There exists a number of different Danbooru-style imageboards, both those who have shared source code and those who are not released for others to use.
Imageboards.
Futaba Channel.
"Futaba Channel" (ふたば☆ちゃんねる), or "Futaba" for short, is a popular, anonymous BBS and imageboard system based in Japan. Its boards usually do not distinguish between "not safe for work" and "clean" content, but there is a strict barrier between two-dimensional (drawn) and three-dimensional (computer graphics (CG) and photographic) pictures that is heavily enforced and debated.
4chan.
"4chan" is an English language imageboard based on the Japanese imageboard Futaba Channel. This imageboard is based primarily upon the posting of pictures (generally related to anime, manga, and popular culture) and their discussion. The Guardian describes it as "at once brilliant, ridiculous and alarming."
The site and its userbase have received attention from the media for a number of reasons, including attacks against Hal Turner on his Internet shows, distributed denial-of-service attacks against eBaum's World, taking part in Project Chanology, and multiple cases of anti-animal abuse reports.
Many Internet memes have originated there, including lolcats, rickrolling and Pedobear.

Simon Cross (rugby union)

Simon Terriss Cross (born 3 February 1981 in Mauritius) is a Scottish rugby union player. He currently plays in the back row as a flanker for Edinburgh Rugby, who compete in the Magners League and Heineken Cup. Cross was educated at Sedbergh School.
Club career.
Cross joined Edinburgh Rugby in 2003 after starting his professional career with London Wasps where he captained the Under-21 side for three years.
During the 2006–07 season, Cross was loaned by Edinburgh to English National Division One club Waterloo for a period of one month.
Cross was appointed Club Captain at the start of the 2007–08 season alongside Allister Hogg as First Team Captain. Cross will retain the club captaincy for the 2008–09 season, this time with Mike Blair as First Team Captain.
In April 2008, Cross signed a new two-year contract with Edinburgh.
As part of the draft of all players from the Scottish pro-teams (Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors) to the Scottish Premier One rugby clubs, Cross was selected by Selkirk and will be available to play for them during the 2008–09 season when not required by Edinburgh or any of the national teams.
Cross will retire from professional rugby at the end of the 2009/2010 season due to persistent knee problems.
International career.
Cross represented Scotland Under-19 in the 2000 IRB/FIRA Junior World Cup.
In 2002, Cross turned down the opportunity to play with the England Under-21 team and in 2003 joined the Scottish national training squad pending a ruling from the IRB on his qualification to play for Scotland.
Cross, who has always considered himself to be Scottish, was born in a British military hospital in Mauritius. His mother, Fiona, was also born in a British military hospital in Germany, and his father, Peter, is English. Cross's maternal grandfather and great-grandfather were aso born in military hospitals, both in India. His great-great-grandfather was born in Scotland.
On 21 January 2004, the IRB Regulations Committee ruled that he was free to play for Scotland having demonstrated a "close, credible and established national link with the country" and accepted that "certain rights flow from birth in a British military hospital".
The Committee's statement went on to say that "if the player, his mother and/or grandfather had not been on military service and therefore born in British military hospitals, the strong likelihood is that given the historical circumstances and family lineage at least one of them would have been born in Scotland."
"The committee also took the view that close links to Scotland were further demonstrated by the fact that the player, who was eligible to play for other unions, refrained from representing such other unions."
"In particular he turned down opportunities to play with the England national representative under 21s team in 2002."
Despite having been selected for national training squads by both the current Scotland coach, Frank Hadden, and his predecessor, Matt Williams, and even being named among the replacements, Cross has yet to receive a full international cap.
In 2007, Cross represented Scotland during the final four rounds of the 2006-07 IRB Sevens World Series in Hong Kong, Adelaide, London and the inaugural Edinburgh Sevens at Murrayfield.
Coaching.
In addition to his playing duties for Edinburgh, Cross will be the first team coach for Murrayfield Wanderers from the 2008–09 season. He has appointed his Edinburgh team mate, Andrew Easson as backs coach.
Cross previously coached Penicuik for five years.

SS City of Boston

The SS City of Boston was a British iron-hulled single-screw passenger steamship of the Inman Line which disappeared in the North Atlantic Ocean en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool in January 1870. 
Description.
The "City of Boston" was built by shipbuilders Tod & Macgregor of Partick, Glasgow and launched on 15 November 1864. Her maiden voyage, on 8 February 1865, was from Liverpool to New York via Queenstown.
Disappearance.
The "City of Boston" sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia for Liverpool on 28 January 1870 commanded by Captain Halcrow. She had 191 people on board: 55 cabin passengers, 52 steerage passengers and a crew of 84. A number of the passengers were prominent businessmen and military officers from Halifax. She never reached her destination and no trace of her was ever found.
A violent gale and snowstorm took place two days after her departure which may have contributed to her loss. Collision with an iceberg was another explanation suggested at the time.
"City of Boston" had been fitted with a two-blade propeller to replace her original three-blade propeller which had been broken during her previous voyage, and Captain Brooks of the SS "City of Brooklyn" expressed the opinion that the new propeller would not be strong enough to let her make headway against the adverse weather.
Rumors of the "Dynamite Fiend".
On 11 December 1875 the mystery of the "City of Boston" took a brief turn, that looked like it might give a solution, albeit a melodramatic one. On that day the German seaport of Bremerhaven was the scene of a dynamite explosion that killed eighty people. It turned out that a barrel being stored on board a ship had been a specially made dynamite bomb with a remarkable timer. It was to explode and sink the ship and kill most (if not all the passengers) out at sea (where no trace of the vessel wold be likely to be found). The purpose was to collect insurance on the cargo. The premature explosion of the barrel caused the man responsible (one "William Thompson") to shoot himself. He became known in the period as the "Dynamite Fiend". In time Thompson was revealed to be one "Alexander Keith, Jr." a Canadian from Halifax, Nova Scotia. In the wake of the discovery of his scheme and crime, police departments around the world were wondering if Thompson/Keith had been involved in the disappearance of other ships. 
Thompson had been in New York City in the winter of 1870, and it was wondered if he had any hand in the disappearance of the "City of Boston". At the time he had sent two large money transfers to his wife from New York, and that looked like a possible pay-off by some partners in the scheme. As he came from Halifax, and the "City of Boston" was headed for Halifax, it looked like there could be a connection, especially as part of the cargo included a shipment of furs by one "James Thompson" of Halifax. However, further investigation found that Mr. James Thompson was a real merchant, who lost a valuable shipment of furs on the "City of Boston", and (ironically) was unable to get the shipment insured. After that the possibility of a link between Thompson/Keith and the disappearance of the "City of Boston" diminished.

Basin (chanson de geste)

Basin is a "chanson de geste" about Charlemagne's childhood. While the Old French epic poem has been lost, the story has come down to us via a 13th-century Norse prose version in the "Karlamagnús saga".
Plot.
At the death of his father, an angel warns the young Charlemagne to take to the Ardennes and join up with the notorious thief Basin. During their adventures, Charlemagne learns of a plot to kill him and, in the end, the traitors are discovered, Charlemagne is crowned and Basin the thief is rewarded.
Historical sources.
The traitors in the story (Rainfroi and Helpri) are most likely based on Chilperic and Ragenfrid who were defeated by Charles Martel in 717 CE. It is unknown if the author was acquainted with an 11th-century version of these events called "Passio Agilolfi".
Influence.
The names of the traitors in Basin were passed on to two other "chansons de geste" about Charlemagne's youth: "Mainet" and "Berthe aus grans piés".

<doc id="18985419" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18985419" title="Lord Gordon-Gordon">
Lord Gordon-Gordon

Lord Gordon-Gordon, also known as Lord Gordon Gordon, Lord Glencairn and The Hon. Mr. Herbert Hamilton (c1840–1874) was a British fraud and impostor, responsible for one of the greatest swindles in the 19th century United States. He swindled $1 million from Jay Gould, who was fighting for control of the Erie Railroad, and then fled to Canada. A failed kidnapping attempt by Gould and associates ended in their arrest and almost caused a military confrontation between the United States and Canada.
Life in Britain.
Little is known about the early life of Lord Gordon-Gordon. His real name is unknown, and it was rumoured that he was the illegitimate son of a North Country clergyman and his family maid.
The first major incident involving Gordon-Gordon was in 1868, when under the name of "Lord Glencairn", he swindled London jewellers Marshall & Son for £25,000. In March 1870, he left Britain and travelled to the United States.
Career in North America.
Glencairn took the name "Lord Gordon-Gordon" as his alias, claiming to be a cousin of the Campbells, a descendant of Lochinvar and of the ancient kings of the Scottish Highlands. He arrived in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and became involved with the Northern Pacific Railway. He told them that he was in America so that he could buy large tracts of land, upon which he could settle tenants from his overpopulated estates in Scotland.
Gordon-Gordon's next major incident came three months later, when he moved to New York, claiming he was going to transfer his funds from Scotland in order to finance his purchase. With him, he carried a letter of introduction from Gould, who was then trying to gain control of the Erie Railroad in the Erie War. Gordon-Gordon told Gould that with the help of several Europeans who had stock in the company, he could help Gould gain control of the railroad. Gould agreed to help him, on the condition that he gave Gordon-Gordon $1 million in negotiable stock in what he called, "a pooling of interests": i.e. a bribe. However, as soon as Gordon-Gordon had taken the stock he put it on the market, swindling Gould.
Gould sued Gordon-Gordon, with Gordon-Gordon put on trial in March 1873. Gordon-Gordon gave the names of his European personages in court, whom he claimed to represent, and was granted bail while the references were checked. Gordon-Gordon took this opportunity to flee to Canada, where he convinced authorities that the allegations brought against him were false. Gordon-Gordon then offered to buy large parts of Manitoba; an investment which would bring prosperity to Canada.
After failing to convince or force Canadian authorities to hand over Gordon-Gordon, Gould and his associates, who included two future Governors of Minnesota and three future Members of Congress, attempted to kidnap him. The group was successful, but were stopped and arrested by the North-West Mounted Police before they could return to the United States. The kidnappers were put in prison and refused bail. This led to an international incident between the United States and Canada. Upon learning that the kidnappers were not given bail, Governor Horace Austin of Minnesota demanded their return and put the local militia on a state of full readiness. Thousands of Minnesotans volunteered for a full military invasion of Canada. However, after negotiations, the Canadian authorities released the kidnappers on bail.
Gordon-Gordon believed himself safe, as at that time, grand larceny and embezzlement were not crimes serious enough to warrant extradition. However, the news surrounding Gordon-Gordon reached Europe. The firm Marshall & Son, the jewellers Gordon-Gordon had robbed some years ago, sent a representative to Canada who identified Gordon-Gordon as Lord Glencairn. Gordon-Gordon claimed that it was a smear campaign created by Gould and his associates, but the Canadian authorities considered the charges serious enough to sentence him to deportation. Before his deportation, Gordon-Gordon held a farewell party in his hotel room, where he gave expensive presents to his guests. After the party, he committed suicide by shooting himself on August 1, 1874.

Diablo (video game)

Diablo is an action role-playing hack and slash video game developed by Blizzard North and released by Blizzard Entertainment on December 31, 1996.
Set in the fictional Kingdom of Khanduras, located in the world of Sanctuary, "Diablo" has the player take control of a lone hero battling to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Beneath the town of Tristram, the player journeys through sixteen dungeon levels, ultimately entering Hell itself in order to face Diablo.
An expansion pack, entitled "", was released in , although it was not created by Blizzard Entertainment. In 1998 Blizzard released Diablo for the PlayStation. This version featured direct control of the main character using the PlayStation controller and was developed by Climax. This was followed by a sequel, "Diablo II", in , and a third game, "Diablo III", was released on May 15, 2012.
Gameplay.
"Diablo" is an action role-playing hack and slash video game. The player moves and interacts with the environment primarily by way of a mouse. Other actions, such as casting a spell, are performed in response to keyboard inputs. The player can acquire items, learn abilities, defeat enemies, and interact with NPCs throughout the entire game.
Classes.
"Diablo" has three character classes: the warrior, the rogue, and the sorcerer. Each class has a different set of assigned attributes along with a unique skill. Although each class is capable of using almost all of the same items and spells, class defined skills and attributes reward play that utilizes them efficiently.
In the expansion set, "", the Monk was added. Two other characters, the Bard and Barbarian', were hidden characters in "Diablo: Hellfire".
Items.
Many items have attribute minimums to be used effectively. White-colored items are normal items, blue-colored items are magic items and gold-colored items are unique items. Any items that are not white in color must be identified to make use of their magical effects, however, characters can use unidentified items as they would the base item. Items wear down through use and only have a certain amount of durability. When an item's durability is zero, it is destroyed. The sword is typically one-handed, though two-handed varieties also exist. Axes are all two handed, and are for those who are willing to sacrifice defense for power. Maces and clubs add a 50% damage bonus against the undead. Bows are the ranged weapon of the game, best used by rogues. Staves, while capable of physical attacks, are mainly used for the spell charges they contain. The spell on the staff can only be used a certain number of times before they require a recharge. There are three classifications of armor: light, medium and heavy, and is available for the head and torso. Shields allow for blocking of attacks. Characters are allowed to wear two rings and one amulet. Books contain spell formulas. Spell books cannot be used more than once, but multiple books of the same spell will increase the spell level, up to a maximum of 15. Scrolls allow use of both spells not yet learned, and spells not available in book form. They vanish after one use. Many potions are available for use, including health and mana restoration, and elixirs that increase statistics.
Multiplayer.
Multiplayer can be done with up to four players. Multiplayer characters' states are saved periodically. Players can either be aggressive towards, or play co-operatively with, other players. Players can connect by one of the following: direct connection, modem connection, Battle.net connection or IPX network connection. The game lacks the stronger anti-cheating methods of Blizzard's later games and as a result, many characters online have been altered in various ways by common third-party programs known as trainers and/or game editing programs such as Cheat Engine.
Plot.
Setting.
The setting of "Diablo" includes the world of Sanctuary, as well as Heaven and Hell. After eons of war between angels and demons, the ascension of man prompted the three Lords of Hell (including Diablo himself) to seek victory through influence, prompting their exile into the mortal realm. There, they sowed chaos, distrust, and hatred among the humans of Sanctuary until a group of magi trapped them in soulstones. Diablo's soulstone was buried deep in the earth and a monastery was built over the site.
Generations passed and the purpose of the monastery was forgotten. A small town named Tristram sprang up next to the monastery's ruins. When King Leoric rebuilt the monastery as a cathedral, Diablo manipulated its archbishop, Lazarus, to destroy his soulstone prison. Diablo subsequently possessed the king, sending out his knights and priests to battle against peaceful kingdoms, and then possessed the king's son, Prince Albrecht, filling the caves and catacombs beneath the cathedral with creatures formed from the young boy's nightmares.
Tristram became a town of fear and horror, where people were abducted in the night. With no king, no law, and no army left to defend them, many villagers fled.
Plot.
The game starts when the player's character arrives in Tristram. The labyrinth under the Cathedral descends from a simple dungeon to catacombs to the dark caves and finally the fiery pits of Hell itself, each full of the undead, monsters, and demons. Leoric has been re-animated as the Skeleton King, and the hero must kill him so he can be released from his curse. The hero must also kill Archbishop Lazarus, and eventually fight Diablo himself.
At the end of the game the hero kills Diablo's mortal form, leaving Diablo trapped in a soulstone once again. The hero then drives the soulstone into his own skull in an attempt to contain the Lord of Terror. "Diablo II" continues the story, with Diablo having possessed the warrior hero who killed him.
Release.
"Diablo" normally requires the original CD to play, however also included on the disk is a shareware version of the software that could be played without the CD called "Diablo" Spawn. This version of the game allows access to only the first two areas of the dungeon, and locks out two of the three playable classes and many of the NPC townsfolk. It is playable in both single- and multi-player with those restrictions. You could also download the demo online, but it was a huge download for its time - 50 megabytes.
In 1998, a PlayStation version of Diablo was published by Electronic Arts. The game lacked online play, but featured a two-player cooperative mode. It also featured an option to learn the story through a narrator without having to find the books in the game. This version was infamous because of its need for 10 blocks free on a PlayStation memory card [http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/197112-diablo/50178668][http://www.epinions.com/review/game-Software-All-Playstation-Diablo/game-review-6DB2-172DCB1B-388A9FC0-prod3]; the standard size of memory cards for the platform was 15 blocks.
The only official expansion pack made for "Diablo" was "" in 1997. The expansion was produced by Sierra Entertainment rather than an in-house Blizzard North development team. The multiplayer feature of the expansion pack was disabled with version 1.01. The added content included two additional dungeon segments located within a new side storyline, several new unique items and magical item properties, new spells, and a fourth class, the Monk. There were also two possibly unfinished "test" classes (the Bard and Barbarian) and two quests which could be accessed only through a configuration file modification.
The original game was later re-released alongside "Hellfire" in a 1998 bundle, called "Diablo + Hellfire". 1998's "Blizzard's Game of the Year Collection" contained copies of "Diablo", "StarCraft" and '. The "Blizzard Anthology" (2000) contained "Diablo", "StarCraft", ' and "WarCraft II: Battle.net Edition". The "Diablo Gift Pack" (2000) contained "Diablo" and "Diablo II", but no expansions. The "Diablo: Battle Chest" (2001) contained "Diablo", "Diablo II" and "Diablo IIs expansion, '. Later releases of the "Diablo: Battle Chest" also have a strategy guide for "Diablo II and LoD", though subsequent releases do not include the original game, instead featuring "Diablo II", its expansion, and their respective strategy guides.
Music.
The music of "Diablo" was composed by Matt Uelmen. The soundtrack consisted of six tracks, it was released after 15 years, in 2011. It is called the "Diablo 15th Anniversary Music" CD.
Reception.
The game has received critical acclaim. With an average rating of 94 on Metacritic, with many awarding the game near-perfect or perfect scores on their respective grading systems. Most praised the game's addictive gameplay, immense replayability, dark atmosphere, superior graphics, moody musical score, and its great variety of possible magic items, enemies, levels, and quests. This last aspect was praised by GameSpot editor Trent Ward in his review of "Diablo": "Similarly, although a set number of monsters is included, only a few will be seen during each full game. This means that players going back for their second or third shot at the game will very likely fight opponents they haven't seen before. Talk about replay value." 
Reviewers commonly cited the online multiplayer aspect as one of the strongest points of the game, with it being described as greatly extending its replay value. "Computer Games Magazine"s Cindy Yans said that "weapons, armor and items are so numerous that you're "always" acquiring something new to try…not to "mention" the game’s multiplayer universe"; she went on to say that "for anyone who enjoys a good multiplayer dungeon crawl, "Diablo" can’t be beat". The most common complaint about the game was the length of its single-player aspect, which many felt was too short. Cindy Yans finished her review, "Despite the rather pale storyline, [...] watered-down quests and a fair amount of necessary repetition, "Diablo" is a must for anyone interested in 'just plain fun.'" On GameSpot's main page for Diablo, the subtext used to describe the game when it came out simply states: "Diablo is the best game to come out in the past year, and you should own a copy. Period."
Awards.
"Diablo" was awarded GameSpot's Game of the Year Award for 1996. As of January 7, 2013, "Diablo" has GameSpot's #1 spot of all PC games, with a score of 9.6 out of 10.
Sales.
As of August 29, 2001, "Diablo" had sold 2.5 million copies worldwide.

Joe Carter (guitarist)

Joe Carter (November 6, 1927 – June 15, 2001) was an American blues guitarist and singer, formerly active on the Chicago blues scene.
Biography.
Born Joseph J. Carter in Midland, Georgia, he was taught to play guitar by Lee Willis as a youngster in Georgia. He moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1952, where he met Muddy Waters. He formed his first band with Otis "Big Smokey" Smothers on guitar and Lester Davenport on harmonica, though he never recorded with this band. He was offered a recording contract with Cobra Records, but turned it down because he made more money with his club gigs. In the 1950s he performed frequently at the 708 Club, one of the premier blues clubs on Chicago's south side, often billed as Joe "Elmore James, Jr." Carter because of his mastery of the Elmore James slide guitar style.
Carter worked at the Hormel Meat Packing plant for many years when he was inactive as a musician.
Carter did not begin recording until 1976, when his debut album was issued on Barrelhouse Records. In the late 1980s he performed occasionally at the Lilly's nightclub on Chicago's north side, backed by the band The Ice Cream Men. By the early 1990s he had developed throat cancer and was forced to curtail his career.
Carter died in June 2001 in Chicago.

Eyring Science Center

The Eyring Science Center (ESC) is one of the science buildings on Brigham Young University campus. It was built in 1950 and named after Carl F. Eyring in 1954.
The Eyring Science Center houses the Departments of Physics and Astronomy, Geology, and Food Science and Nutrition. The Department of Chemistry has in the past been located at the Eyring Science Center but is not currently headquartered there.
In 1968 an underground physics research lab was added to the north end of the building. Research on plasma, atomic processes, lasers, high-pressure physics, nan-technology, acoustics, and cold fusion has been conducted here. It is the home of two modern TEMs. 
Also in the building is the Royden G. Derrick Planetarium. This 119 seat facility with a acoustically treated dome was built in 2005 to replace the smaller, outdated Sarah Berrett Summerhays Planetarium. The building also has several acoustics labs including two anechoic chambers and a reverberation chamber for performing acoustics research.
The 5th and 6th floors of the Eyring Science Center constitute the Orson Pratt Observatory, named after Orson Pratt. 
In the early years of the ESC James A. Jensen's dinosaur displays were often in the lobby. However since the building of the BYU Earth Science Museum there are not often dinosaur displays.
The main lobby of the building is noted for its Focault pendulum. It also is the home to a student-run restaurant, the Pendulum Court.
The Eyring Science Center was the first BYU building to have an elevator.
In the summer of 2006 a new dome was installed on the Eyring Science Center's observatory to better allow for astronomical study on campus.

Jerónimo Manrique de Lara

Jerónimo Manrique de Lara ( before 1538 – d. 1 September 1595) was a church leader in Spain, a General Inquisitor.
Grand son of famous Rodrigo Manrique, (1406 – Ocaña, 1476), first count of Paredes de Nava, one of the pretenders to be recognized as "Maestre" of the military Order of Santiago, a nephew – grand son also of Bishop and Archbishop Iñigo Manrique de Lara, (deceased 1585).
He was an illegitimate offspring, "barragán" in Spanish for a father being a priest, of Bishop, Archbishop, Cardinal and General Inquisitor Alfonso Manrique de Lara, ( ???? – Bishop of Badajoz, circa 1499 – Bishop of Córdoba 1516 – Archbishop of Seville 1523 – Cardinal 1531 – September 1538), becoming a Bishop of Cartagena, (1583–1591), and later Bishop of Ávila, (1591–1595).
There is not much to be said of his time as a General Inquisitor because of his death barely 10 months later.
It is known however that Flemish – German born Johannes Bartholomeus Avontroot, (nacido 1556), resident in the Spanish Canary Islands was some sort of administrator of a sugar manufacturer in Tazacorte and Argual also Flemish, Paulus Vandale. One of Paulus daughters, María Vandale, had been married to a Melchor de Monteverde. She married Avontroot as a widower from Don Melchor but the step children of Avontroot declared to the local inquisitors their new step father ate meat on certain days fast on meat dishes was compulsory for Catholics and suggested laziness about the step father attending Sunday masses. Just before 1595 the Canary Islands Inquisition had already, apparently, a thick dossier on neglectful Avontroot. Whether these documents were sent to the General Inquisitor in Toledo is not known but could be possible.

Will Hill

Will Bill Hill III (born March 7, 1990) is an American football safety for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Florida, and was a member of a BCS National Championship team. The Giants signed Hill as an undrafted free agent in 2011.
Early years.
Hill was born in East Orange, New Jersey and raised in West Orange, New Jersey. He attended St. Peter's Preparatory School in Jersey City, New Jersey. In his junior year he played receiver, quarterback, running back, and safety. He ran for 682 yards from both running back and quarterback positions and threw for 758 yards. He had three interceptions and 68 tackles playing free safety and had 444 yards receiving. As a senior Hill had 947 yards passing and seven touchdowns, he rushed for 960 yards and 19 touchdowns and had 43 tackles, four interceptions and three pass breakups on defense. He was a first team all-state selection. He was 2007 New Jersey Offensive Player of the Year.

ESPN rated him as the second overall football prospect and the top-ranked overall athlete in the nation. Rivals rated Hill tenth and Scout rated him sixth among all college football recruits.
College career.
Hill accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida, where he played for coach Urban Meyer's Florida Gators football team from 2008 to 2010.

As a collegiate player, Hill demonstrated flashes of the athleticism that lead to him being a highly touted recruit coming out of high school, however, he was regarded as an average player, never realizing the early expectations. During his 3 seasons at the University of Florida, his play was overshadowed by the superior contributions of teammates Major Wright and All-American Ahmad Black. Hill never recorded more than two interceptions in a season, finishing his career with four, and never finished a season higher than sixth on the team in tackles.
Professional career.
After entering the 2011 NFL Draft, Hill was not selected. Hill was later signed by the Arizona Rattlers.
On May 14, 2012, Hill was signed by the New York Giants. On October 8, 2012, the NFL suspended Hill for using Adderall. He was able to return to the Giants active roster on November 5, the day after the Giants played the Pittsburgh Steelers. Hill was eventually activated to the active roster. Hill was suspended a second time for the first four games of the 2013 season for violating the NFL's policy on substances of abuse. His ban ended on Sept. 30.
On December 21, 2013, Hill was arrested in New Jersey on a warrant for outstanding child support payments. Despite the arrest, Hill still played that Sunday against the Detroit Lions. During the game he intercepted a pass thrown by Matthew Stafford in the fourth quarter and scored on a 38 yard touchdown to tie the game and force overtime. In overtime, the Giants would go on to win the game 23-20.

William Kenrick (writer)

William Kenrick (1725? – 10 June 1779) was an English novelist, playwright, translator and satirist, who spent much of his career libelling and lampooning his fellow writers.
Life and career.
Kenrick was born at Watford, Hertfordshire, son of a stay-maker. He apparently obtained a doctorate at Leiden University (although other sources maintain he went to a Scottish university) and appeared for the first time as a pamphletist in 1751 where he wrote, under the name of "Ontologos", "The Grand Question debated; or an Essay to prove that the Soul of Man is not, neither can it be Immortal." In typical fashion, Kenrick forthwith provided an answer to this question proving the reverse, a tactic he often used in order to publicize his productions.
One of his first targets was the vulnerable Christopher Smart whose poem "Night Piece" he attacked in the London monthly journal "The Kapelion; or Poetical Ordinary, consisting of Great Variety of Dishes in Prose and Verse, recommended to all who have a Good Taste or Keen Appetite" in 1750 under the "nom de plume" Whimsey Banter.
In 1752 Kenrick publicly mocked Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett in his entertainment "Fun: a Parodi-tragi-comical Satire", a parody of "Macbeth" in which the weird sisters circle about their cauldron, throwing in contemporary novels, periodicals and pamphlets. The play was banned by the Lord Mayor however "as it was to have been perform’d at the Castle-Tavern, Pater-noster-Row, on Thursday, February 13, 1752, but Suppressed, by a Special Order from the Lord-Mayor and Court of Aldermen." (see the Paper War of 1752-1753).
James Boswell records a meeting with Kenrick on Friday, 3 April 1772:
In the evening came a company of literati invited for me: Dr. Jeffries, Dr. Gilbert Stuart, a Mr. Leeson, and Kenrick, now Dr. Kenrick, who once wrote an 18d. pamphlet against me, but principally against Mr. Johnson, though it was entitled "A Letter to James Boswell, Esq." Kenrick was quite a different man from what I expected to see. His "Epistles, Philosophical and Moral" promised seriousness or rather profound gravity; and many of his other writings promised acrimony to a high degree. But I found him a bluff, hearty little man, full of spirits and cheerfulness. He said devotion was not natural; that is to say, the devotion of the heart; that fear made people use ceremonies but did not inspire true devotion. He said he had a pronouncing dictionary almost ready, by which he hoped to fix a standard, as the varieties of pronunciation among people in genteel life were very few. He said he taught a man from Aberdeen to speak good English in six weeks. He said his great difficulty was to get him to speak at all. He told him, "Sir, you don't speak at all. You sing."
Success.
Kenrick's most successful work, reprinted in over 20 editions, was a courtesy book published in 1753 under the title "The Whole Duty of a Woman; or, A Guide to the Female Sex, from the Age of Sixteen to Sixty, &c.", but the author was simply listed as “A Lady.” Kenrick here assumed the persona of a fallen woman, now reformed, who wants to persuade other women to live a life of virtue. The irony of Kenrick's presuming to improve the moral tone of feminine England has not gone unnoticed: he has been described as "one of London’s most despised, drunken, and morally degenerate hack writers in the later eighteenth century."
In 1758 appeared his versified "Epistles, Philosophical and Moral", an "avowed defence of infidelity" which afford the best specimens of his poetry.
In November 1759, Kenrick (the "superlative scoundrel") succeeded Oliver Goldsmith as editor of "The Monthly Review". He signalled his advent by writing an outrageous attack upon Goldsmith's "Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe". His vilification was so unjustified that Ralph Griffiths (the publisher) made an indirect apology for his successor by a favourable though brief review (in June, 1762) of "The Citizen of the World".
Publications and works.
James Boswell reported that: Johnson was virulently attacked by Mr. William Kenrick, who obtained the degree of LL.D. from a Scotch University, and wrote for the booksellers in a great variety of branches. Though he certainly was not without considerable merit, he wrote with so little regard to decency and principles, and decorum, and in so hasty a manner, that his reputation was neither extensive nor lasting. I remember one evening, when some of his works were mentioned, Dr. Goldsmith said, he had never heard of them; upon which Dr. Johnson observed, "Sir, he is one of the many who have made themselves publick, without making themselves known.". 
Kenrick complained: "One species of our predecessor's merit, however, I presume myself at least entitled to, that of perserverance; it being now fifteen years since I first engaged in this undertaking, which I have since pursued with almost unremitted assiduity, and that not only at considerable waste of time and expense, but under the constant mortification of hearing it equally ridiculed by those who do know, and by those who do not know, anything of the matter."
Ending career.
The General Biographical Dictionary of 1815 describes Kenrick's end and sums up his career: "In his latter days, his constitution was so much injured by inebriety, that he generally wrote with a bottle of brandy by his elbow, which at length terminated his career June 10, 1779, less lamented than perhaps any person known in the literary world, yet possessed of talents which, under a steady and virtuous direction, might have procured him an honourable place among the authors of his time."
Indeed, Kenrick wrote revealingly of himself:

Stanford String Quartet

The Stanford String Quartet was formed in 1984 as a special project of the Stanford University Department of Music. 
Personnel.
Faculty member and violinist Andor Toth became the first violinist. He was joined by Stanford faculty members Bernard Zaslov, viola and Stephen Harrison, cello. Alternating as second violinists were Zoya Lebin and Susan Frier.
1987-89 Season.
The Quartet's 1987-88 season included the world premiere of Bathsheba and Her Suitors, a composition by Jose Bowen commissioned by jazz flutist Hubert Laws and the Stanford String Quartet.
1989-90 Season.
The 1989-90 season was built around two compositions commissioned by the Quartet, String Quartet no. 9 by Ben Johnston, and the Tenth String Quartet by Stanford alumni William Bolcom, a faculty member at the University of Michigan. The Quartet also programmed these works on a national tour commemorating the 100th anniversary of the founding of Stanford University. The tour included performances at the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and at Alice Tully Hall, New York City. The Quartet's New York City concert at Alice Tully Hall was reviewed on February 4, 1989 by John Rockwell, music critic for the New York Times. Rockwell said this of the Quartet: ". . . their playing epitomizes central European musicianship at its best: sensible, comfortable, unassuming . . ."[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DB1631F937A35751C0A96F948260&scp=1&sq=stanford+string+quartet&st=nyt]
Signature Recording.
The Johnston and Bolcom quartets were recorded in 1991 by Laurel Records in Los Angeles, California, at Paramount Hall and Skywalker Hall. Also on this initial signature CD is the String Quartet by Marc Neikrug, "Stars the Mirror." This CD gave all three compositions their world premiere recording.
New personnel.
After the retirement of Andor Toth in 1989, the members of the Quartet were Phillip Levy and Susan Freier, violins; Bernard Zaslov, viola; and Stephen Harrison, cello. This quartet recorded a CD in 1993 that was released in 1994 on the Music & Arts label. The CD included compositions by Darius Milhaud, Frank Bridge, and Gabriel Fauré.

Andrew J M Sykes was Professor of Sociology at the University of Strathclyde from 1967 - 1989. According to a biographical note: 'He received his doctorate in industrial sociology from Glasgow University. He taught Management Studies at Scottish College of Commerce for three years and then joined the staff at the University of Strathclyde in 1963. Professor Sykes has conducted research into social relations and attitude changes in printing, civil engineering, clerical employment, motor car assembling, social change in Ireland, industrial training and shipping.'
In 1974 Sykes was a member of a Study Group set up by the Institute for the Study of Conflict which published a report in February of that year titled 'Sources of conflict in British Industry'. Other members of the Study Group were Ken Watkins, Brian Crozier, Prof. A. R. Hersic of Bedford College, University of London and Prof. Raymond Thomas of the University of Bath. According to Richard Cockett 'the report claimed to be a comprehensive exposure of those politically motivated Trotskist of Communist-linked trade unionists within the trade union movement, who, under cover of legitimate industrial action, sought to create a revolutionary situation. the ISC thus drew some grave conclusions about the threat to democracy in Britain:
As Cockett notes: 'Not surprisingly, given that this Report appeared at the time of the 1974 miners' strike, it attracted widespread publicity and the Observer, for instance, published Section 8 of the Report on 'Militant extremism and political subversion' in full.

Shiva (actor)

Shiva is an Indian film actor who has featured in Tamil language films, and had previously been a radio jockey with Radio Mirchi. Acting mainly in comedy films, he rose to fame following his performances in the Venkat Prabhu directorials "Chennai 600028" and "Saroja", before also featuring in "Thamizh Padam".
Film career.
Mirchi Shiva's first film role was a cameo in the 2001 film "12B". He debuted as a lead actor in Venkat Prabhu's 2007 sports comedy "Chennai 600028" alongside ten other debut actors. His next role, again under Venkat's direction, was the thriller "Saroja". Both films were box-office hits.
Mirchi Shiva then starred in "Thamizh Padam", a full-length parody of contemporary Tamil cinema, and his performance earned rave reviews. His 2010 comedy "Va Quarter Cutting" was an average grosser. His first 2011 release became the long-delayed romantic drama "Pathinaaru", which was his first non-comedy venture.
In 2012, he featured alongside Vimal in Sundar C's comedy film, "Kalakalappu", which won positive reviews and performed well commercially. Portraying the role of a small time crook, Raghu, critics noted that Shiva was the film's "scene-stealer" and "carries the first half with his quips". The success of the film fetched the actor more scripts and Shiva went on to feature in four comedies in 2013. His first release "Thillu Mullu", a remake of the 1981 Rajinikanth starrer, featured him alongside Isha Talwar and Prakash Raj and also fared well commercially. The actor also won positive portrayal of a conman with a critic noting "Shiva has taken the entire film in his shoulders and has given his best. His comic timing is perfect and the one-liners are hilarious." His second release of the year, "Sonna Puriyathu", where he played a dubbing artist, also won good reviews. Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu praised the actor's performance noting "Nobody makes silly jokes work with a straight face like Shiva does", noting he is the "funny man pretending to be important." The next release, "Ya Ya" featuring him alongside Santhanam in the lead role, was poorly received with a reviewer from Rediff.com claimed Shiva "fails to make any impact", with the film also faring poorly at the box office. Shiva was next seen in Kiruthiga Udhayanidhi's directorial debut "Vanakkam Chennai", a romantic musical opposite Priya Anand. The film received positive to mixed reviews, but was a commercial success. 
Personal life.
Mirchi Shiva got married to his long-time Girlfriend Priya on November 15, 2012.

Michael Wynn, 7th Baron Newborough

Robert Charles Michael Vaughan Wynn, 7th Baron Newborough DSC (24 April 1917 – 11 October 1998, Istanbul) was a British Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve officer who played a decisive role during the St. Nazaire Raid in 1942 where he commanded a motor torpedo boat. Captured after his boat had to be abandoned, he was sent to Colditz after an escape attempt. He was repatriated after feigning illness.
Military career.
British Army.
Born the eldest son of Sir Robert Vaughan Wynn, 6th Baron Newborough and Ruby Irene Severne, he was educated at Oundle School. In 1935 Wynn was commissioned into the 9th Lancers, then joined the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards and the 16/5th Lancers. He was invalided out of the British Army in 1940. In May 1940, now a civilian, he was given command of a yacht acting as the Air Sea Rescue boat for the Naval air station at Lee-on-Solent. While British forces were being evacuated from northern France he sailed to Dunkirk, and made five successful trips before being hit by shellfire just making Ramsgate. Wynn then took command of a Norfolk fishing boat and went to beaches south of Calais where it was thought the Guards were hiding in the sand dunes. Wearing naval uniform in case he was taken for a spy he searched for but never found the Guards. The Royal Navy recognising his abilities gave him a commission in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in July 1941.
Royal Navy.
Stationed at , a Coastal Forces shore base in Gosport, he was involved with a plan to attack the German battleships and . The plan involved a motor torpedo boat specially modified during construction by Vosper Thornycroft, the "MTB 74", which was specially built to house torpedo tubes on its foredeck instead of midships. The mission would be to fire the modified torpedoes over the anti-submarine net in Brest harbour where they would sink to the sea-bed and explode after a time delay. The weapons were nicknamed 'Wynns weapons'. The MTB entered service in December 1941. However while this experiment was being trialled, the ships made a daring escape from Brest to the Baltic, nicknamed the "Channel Dash". Left without a mission, "MTB 74" was instead re-tasked to the St. Nazaire raid where it was proposed she could torpedo the inner caisson of the Normandy Dock or a lockgate to the Submarine Basin. Further tests were carried out prior to the raid on St Nazaire and adjustments made to the delayed-action mechanism of the torpedoes which were fired by "MTB 74".
St Nazaire.
On 28 March 1942, Sub-Lieutenant Wynn was to play a decisive part in the raid on St. Nazaire, the only port on the Atlantic seaboard in which the newly completed German battleship could be docked. The plan, code-named "Operation Chariot", entailed a former US Navy destroyer, , carrying 24 time-fused Amatol explosive charges, ramming the gates of St. Nazaire harbour. The ship was to also carry commandos who were tasked with destroying shore-based installations. The charges in "Campbeltown" would later explode and hopefully destroy the dock caisson. If this was not successful, "MTB 74" commanded by Sub-Lieutenant Micky Wynn, was to be armed with two delayed-action torpedoes to be fired at the dock caisson. Also deployed to the raid were two destroyers, a motor gun boat and 16 motor launches.
The Chariot force sailed from Falmouth with "MTB 74" towed by "Campbeltown". The MTB was equipped with three Packard engines capable of almost 40 knots (74 km/h) and two Ford V8s which were designed for maneuvering at . Too fast with one combination of engines and too slow with the other, the MTB was put onto tow until the convoy reached St. Nazaire. The ships crossed of open sea and were three miles (5 km) up the Loire estuary before the Germans opened fire. "Campbeltown", which was flying the German ensign, immediately replied in German by Morse and Aldis lamp, and the enemy batteries held their fire, allowing "Campbeltown" to move closer to the docks. At 1.27am and closing on the gate, "Campbeltown" replaced the German flag and hauled up the British ensign. Under intense fire "Campbeltown" cut through the torpedo net and rammed the dock gates at 1.34. Wynn, who had been cast off from "Campbeltown", was ordered to fire his two torpedoes at his secondary target, the gate at the old entrance. Wynn reported to Commander Ryder and was congratulated on his success with a swift drink from a flask.
Having picked up survivors from "Campbeltown" and an MTB, Wynn was ordered to return to England. He turned his craft and ran his full speed of 40 knots (74 km/h). Wynn spotted two men on a Carley float directly ahead of him. He had to make a snap decision, either to stop—which could be done quickly—or to drive on, which would have meant that the men would be washed off their float and probably drowned. He later recorded, "it was an awful decision . . . I decided to stop the vessel and we pulled up right alongside them. My crew had got hold of them, but unfortunately at that very moment the German shore batteries found their mark and two shells went straight through us." Wynn was blown from the bridge down to the bilges. He was saved by the chief motor mechanic, Chief Petty Officer Lovegrove, who decided to search that area before jumping overboard. He held the severely injured Wynn and joined other survivors on a Carley float. When the Germans found them 12 hours later only three men were left out of 36.
That morning, whilst the "Campbeltown" was being inspected by Germans, five tonnes of explosive blew up rendering the dock completely useless until after the war. Two days later Wynn's two torpedoes exploded and destroyed the gates of the old entrance. Wynn, now a Prisoner of War and blinded in one eye, heard the explosion. Five Victoria Crosses were awarded for the raid with Wynn awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.
Colditz.
Wynn now sporting a glass eye courtesy of his captors was moved to Marlag Nord POW camp near Bremen. After escaping he was sent to Colditz in January 1943 and was repatriated on medical grounds in January 1945. Hearing that Lovegrove was held in a German naval camp he volunteered to join the relieving force and met again with the man who had saved his life at St. Nazaire.
Post War.
After the war he returned to farming, and in 1963 became High Sheriff of Merionethshire. In 1965 he succeeded his father as Lord Newborough and inherited in North Wales. In 1971 to meet the increasing cost of taxation he was forced to sell Bardsey Island to the Bardsey Island Trust. 
In 1976 he was called before the magistrates for allegedly firing a cannon ball across the Menai Strait from Fort Belan, which had been built by a relative. The shot went through the sail of a passing yacht and he was charged with causing criminal damage. Even though it was his mother-in-law's birthday, he denied the charge, protesting that it must have been someone else. He was found guilty and fined. He died in Istanbul in 1998 and his ashes were shot out of an 18th-century cannon.

Carl F. Eyring

Carl Ferdinand Eyring (August 30, 1889–January 3, 1951) was an acoustic physicist. He served for nearly 30 years as dean of Brigham Young University's College of Arts and Sciences.
Eyring was born in Colonia Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico to Henry Eyring and Deseret Fawcett.
Eyring was also a leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served as the first president of the New England Mission from 1937–1939. While president of the New England mission Eyring exerted efforts to keep Latter-day Saint students at Harvard University, MIT and other Boston area institutions of higher learning active in the church.
Eyring was the uncle of the noted chemist Henry Eyring, who was father of President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency of the LDS Church. Carl Eyring was married to Fern Chipman, a daughter of Stephen L. Chipman. She was the sister of Lorena Chipman, who was the wife of Harvey Fletcher. 
From 1924 until 1951, except for his time as mission president, Eyring served as the dean of the college of Arts and Sciences at Brigham Young University.
Eyring was a popular professor; in the words of a BYU student of the time, Spencer W. Kimball, he was "The swellest professor on the whole faculty". However since this is a quote from a letter Spencer wrote to Eyring's niece Camilla (who Kimball would soon marry) it may not represent the views of a large portion of the students.
Eyring personally supervised the building of a new science building on BYU campus in the late 1940s. When the cement was laid for the Eyring Science Center, Eyring sprayed it with a special house to help it cure better. It is said that this cement never cracked. Shortly after the building was dedicated, Eyring died from cancer which had afflicted him for many years. In 1954 it was renamed the Carl F. Eyring Science Center in his honor.
Among those who studied under Eyring was Loren C. Dunn.

Environmental impact of wind power

[[File:Wb deichh drei kuhs.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Livestock and a wind turbine.]]
Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of (onshore) wind power is relatively minor, slightly higher than the environmental impact of hydro power on a life-cycle basis. Unlike electricity derived from fossil fuel and nuclear power plants, wind power consumes no fuel and, unlike fossil fuel power plants, emits no air pollution in operation.
While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.
There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances. Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of peat bogs, affect the siting and operation of wind turbines.
There are anecdotal reports of negative effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines. Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims.
Net energy gain.
Modern wind turbine systems have a net energy gain, in other words during their service life they produce significantly more energy than is used to build the system. Any practical large-scale energy source must produce more energy than is used in its construction. The energy return on investment (EROI) for wind energy is equal to the cumulative electricity generated divided by the cumulative primary energy required to build and maintain a turbine. According to a meta study, in which all existing studies from 1977 to
2007 were reviewed, the EROI for wind ranges from 5 to 35, with an average of around 18. EROI is strongly proportional to turbine size, and larger late-generation turbines are at the high end of this range, at or above 35. Since energy produced is several times energy consumed in construction, there is a net energy gain.
Carbon dioxide emissions and pollution.
Wind power consumes no fuel and no water for continuing operation, and has no emissions directly related to electricity production. Wind turbines produce no carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, mercury, radioactive waste, particulates, or any other type of air pollution, unlike fossil fuel sources and nuclear power plant fuel production. Wind turbine manufacturer Vestas claims that initial energy "pay back" is within about 8.6 months of operation for a V80-2.0MW wind power plant under low wind conditions.
A 2006 study of 3 installations in the US Midwest found the emissions of wind power ranged from per GWh of energy produced. Most of the emission came from producing the concrete for wind-turbine foundations.
A study by the Irish national grid stated that "Producing electricity from wind reduces the consumption of fossil fuels and therefore leads to emissions savings", and found reductions in emissions ranging from of per MWh.
The 2006 UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) study focused on the intermittent nature of the output of some renewable energy sources, concluded that intermittency is not a major obstacle to the integration of renewable sources of electricity supply.
The production of permanent magnets used in some wind turbines makes use of neodymium. Primarily exported by China, pollution concerns associated with the extraction of this rare-earth element have prompted government action in recent years, and international research attempts to refine the extraction process. Research is underway on turbine and generator designs which reduce the need for neodymium, or eliminate the use of rare-earth metals altogether. Additionally, the large wind turbine manufacturer Enercon GmbH chose very early not to use permanent magnets for its direct drive turbines, in order to avoid responsibility for the adverse environmental impact of rare earth mining.
Ecology.
Land use.
Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing. The vegetation clearing and ground disturbance required for wind farms is minimal compared with coal mines and coal-fired power stations. If wind farms are decommissioned, the landscape can be returned to its previous condition.
Farmers and graziers often lease land to companies building wind farms. In the U.S., farmers may receive annual lease payments of two thousand to five thousand dollars per turbine, and wind farms may also provide additional community payments "...to reward residents who have made no financial gains from wind energy development, but whose views of... [the landscape now include a panorama of turbines".
The land can still be used for farming and cattle grazing. Livestock are unaffected by the presence of wind farms. International experience shows that livestock will "graze right up to the base of wind turbines and often use them as rubbing posts or for shade".
Wind-energy advocates contend that less than 1% of the land would be used for foundations and access roads, the other 99% could still be used for farming. A wind turbine needs about 200–400 m² for the foundation. A (small) 500-kW-turbine with an annual production of 1.4 GWh produces 11,7 MWh/m², which is comparable with coal-fired plants (about 15-20 MWh/m²), coal-mining not included. With increasing size of the wind turbine the relative size of the fundation decreases. Critics point out that on some locations in forests the clearing of trees around tower bases may be necessary for installation sites on mountain ridges, such as in the northeastern U.S. This usually takes the clearing of 5,000 m² per wind turbine.
Turbines are not generally installed in urban areas. Buildings interfere with wind, turbines must be sited a safe distance ("setback") from residences in case of failure, and the value of land is high. There are a few notable exceptions to this. The WindShare ExPlace wind turbine was erected in December 2002, on the grounds of Exhibition Place, in Toronto, Canada. It was the first wind turbine installed in a major North American urban city centre. Steel Winds also has a 20 MW urban project south of Buffalo, New York. Both of these projects are in urban locations, but benefit from being on uninhabited lake shore property.
In the UK there has also been concern about the damage caused to peat bogs, with one Scottish MEP campaigning for a moratorium on wind developments on peatlands saying that "Damaging the peat causes the release of more carbon dioxide than wind farms save".
Impact on wildlife.
Environmental assessments are routinely carried out for wind farm proposals, and potential impacts on the local environment (e.g. plants, animals, soils) are evaluated. Turbine locations and operations are often modified as part of the approval process to avoid or minimise impacts on threatened species and their habitats. Any unavoidable impacts can be offset with conservation improvements of similar ecosystems which are unaffected by the proposal.
A research agenda from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, suggests modeling the spatiotemporal patterns of migratory and residential wildlife with respect to geographic features and weather, to provide a basis for science-based decisions about where to site new wind projects. More specifically, it suggests:
Birds.
Projects such as the Black Law Wind Farm have received wide recognition for its contribution to environmental objectives, including praise from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, who describe the scheme as both improving the landscape of a derelict opencast mining site and also benefiting a range of wildlife in the area, with an extensive habitat management projects covering over 14 square kilometres.
The meta-analysis on avian mortality by Benjamin K. Sovacool led him to suggest that there were a number of deficiencies in other researchers' methodologies. Among them, he stated were a focus on bird deaths, but not on the reductions in bird births: for example, mining activities for fossil fuels and pollution from fossil fuel plants have led to significant toxic deposits and acid rain that have damaged or poisoned many nesting and feeding grounds, leading to reductions in births. The large cumulated footprint of wind turbines, which reduces the area available to wildlife or agriculture, is also missing from all studies including Sovacool's. Many of the studies also made no mention of avian deaths per unit of electricity produced, which excluded meaningful comparisons between different energy sources. More importantly, it concluded, the most visible impacts of a technology, as measured by media exposure, are not necessarily the most flagrant ones.
The Sovacool study did a broad assessment of anthropogenic causes of avian mortality and brought together many studies on deaths due to wind energy, fossil fuel energy and nuclear energy. He arrived at a figure for bird deaths due to wind power of 0.269 fatalities per per gigawatt-hour (GWh), by which he extrapolated a total of 7193 US bird fatalities in 2006. He concluded that wind farms and nuclear power stations are responsible each for between 0.3 and 0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while fossil-fueled power stations are responsible for about 5.2 fatalities per GWh. Of the bird deaths Sovacool attributed to fossil-fuel power plants, 96 percent were due to the effects of climate change. While the study did not assess bat mortality due to various forms of energy, he considered it not unreasonable to assume a similar ratio of mortality. The Sovacool study has provoked controversy because of its treatment of data. In a series of replies, Sovacool acknowledged a number of large errors, practically those that relate to his resulting 0.4 fatalities per GWh overestimate for the number of bird deaths per GWh of nuclear power and cautioned that "the study already tells you the numbers are very rough estimates that need to be improved."
Sovacool estimated that in the United States wind turbines kill between 20,000 and 573,000 birds per year, but either figure is minimal compared to bird deaths from other causes. Fossil-fueled power plants, which wind turbines generally require to make up for their weather dependent intermittency, kill almost 20 times as many birds per gigawatt hour (GWh) of electricity. Bird deaths due to other human activities and cats total between 797 million and 5.29 billion per year in the U.S. (see "Causes of avian mortality" table). Additionally, while many studies concentrate on the analysis of bird deaths, few have been conducted on the reductions of bird births, which are the additional consequences of the various pollution sources that wind power partially mitigates.
Bird mortality at wind energy facilities can vary greatly depending on the facility's location, with some facilities reporting nearly zero bird fatalities, and others as high as four birds per turbine per year. An article in the journal "Nature" stated that each wind turbine in the U.S. kills an average of 0.03 birds per year, and recommends that more research needs to be done.
Environmental impact analysis conducted for proposed wind energy facilities in the U.S. have warned that some facilities sited in important bird areas could kill thousands of birds and bats per year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.
Wind facilities have attracted the most attention for impacts on iconic raptor species, including golden eagles. The Pine Tree Wind energy project near Tehachapi, California has one of the highest raptor mortality rates in the country; by 2012 at least eight golden eagles had been killed according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Biologists have noted that it is more important to avoid losses of large birds as they have lower breeding rates and can be more severely impacted by wind turbines in certain areas.
In 2009 a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service scientist estimated that wind turbines kill 440,000 birds per year in the U.S., with future mortality expected to increase significantly as wind power generation expands by 2030 to levels about 12 times higher than 2009 levels. This estimate was disputed by several organizations, with the USFWS later pointing out that it was only an 'estimate' by one of many scientists and was not officially supported by the agency. By comparison approximately 80,000 birds are killed by aircraft in the U.S., and a 2013 report by scientists from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and the USFWS estimated that cats kill as many as 3.7 billion birds yearly in the same country. An earlier report by the American Bird Conservancy had estimated bird predation by U.S. cats at 500 million yearly.
Large numbers of bird deaths are also attributed to collisions with buildings. An estimated 1 to 9 million birds are killed every year by tall buildings in Toronto, Canada alone, according to the wildlife conservation organization Fatal Light Awareness Program. Other studies have stated that 57 million are killed by cars, and 97.5 million killed by collisions with plate glass in the United States alone. Promotional event lightbeams as well as ceilometers used at airport weather offices can be particularly deadly for birds, as birds become caught in their lightbeams and suffer exhaustion and collisions with other birds. In the worst recorded ceilometer lightbeam kill-off during one night in 1954, approximately 50,000 birds from 53 different species died at the Warner Robins Air Force Base in the United States.
In the United Kingdom, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) concluded that "The available evidence suggests that appropriately positioned wind farms do not pose a significant hazard for birds." It notes that climate change poses a much more significant threat to wildlife, and therefore supports wind farms and other forms of renewable energy. In 2009 the RSPB warned that "numbers of several breeding birds of high conservation concern are reduced close to wind turbines" probably because "birds may use areas close to the turbines less often than would be expected, potentially reducing the wildlife carrying capacity of an area. The RSPB also state that the absolute number of bird deaths due to activities such as cat preying require a context, concluding that the birds cat's likely manage to catch are mostly the small weak and sickly members of non-endangered species and therefore cause no detrimental change to their global survival rate, the birds that are most endangered are rarely encountered by cats.
Concerns have been expressed that wind turbines at Smøla, Norway are having a deleterious effect on the population of White-tailed Eagles, Europe's largest bird of prey. They have been the subject of an extensive re-introduction programme in Scotland, which could be jeopardised by the expansion of wind turbines.
The Peñascal Wind Power Project in Texas is located in the middle of a major bird migration route, and the wind farm uses avian radar originally developed for NASA and the United States Air Force to detect birds as far as away. If the system determines that the birds are in danger of running into the rotating blades, the turbines shut down and are restarted when the birds have passed. A 2005 Danish study used surveillance radar to track migrating birds traveling around and through an offshore wind farm. Less than 1% of migrating birds passing through an offshore wind farm in Rønde, Denmark, got close enough to be at risk of collision, though the site was studied only during low-wind conditions. The study suggests that migrating birds may avoid large turbines, at least in the low-wind conditions the research was conducted in.
In 2012, researchers reported that, based on their four-year radar tracking study of birds after construction of an offshore wind farm near Lincolnshire, that pink-footed geese migrating to the U.K. to overwinter altered their flight path to avoid the turbines.
At the Altamont Pass Wind Farm in California, a settlement between the Audubon Society, Californians for Renewable Energy and NextEra Energy Resources who operate some 5,000 turbines in the area requires the latter to replace nearly half of the smaller turbines with newer, more bird-friendly models by 2015 and provide $2.5 million for raptor habitat restoration. The proposed Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind project in Wyoming, however, is expected to kill nearly 5,400 birds each year, including over 150 raptors, according to a Bureau of Land Management environmental analysis.
Bats.
Bats may be injured by direct impact with turbine blades, towers, or transmission lines. Recent research shows that bats may also be killed when suddenly passing through a low air pressure region surrounding the turbine blade tips.
The numbers of bats killed by existing onshore and near-shore facilities have troubled bat enthusiasts.
In April 2009 the Bats and Wind Energy Cooperative released initial study results showing a 73% drop in bat fatalities when wind farm operations are stopped during low wind conditions, when bats are most active. Bats avoid radar transmitters, and placing microwave transmitters on wind turbine towers may reduce the number of bat collisions.
A 2013 study produced an estimate that wind turbines killed more than 600,000 bats in the U.S. the previous year, with the greatest mortality occurring in the Appalachian Mountains. Some earlier studies had produced estimates of between 33,000 and 888,000 bat deaths per year.
Weather and climate change.
Wind farms may affect weather in their immediate vicinity. Spinning wind turbine rotors generate a lot of turbulence in their wakes like the wake of a boat. This turbulence increases vertical mixing of heat and water vapor that affects the meteorological conditions downwind. Overall, wind farms lead to a slight warming at night and a slight cooling during the day time. This effect can be reduced by using more efficient rotors or placing wind farms in regions with high natural turbulence. Warming at night could "benefit agriculture by decreasing frost damage and extending the growing season. Many farmers already do this with air circulators".
A number of studies have used climate models to study the effect of extremely large wind farms. One study reports simulations that show detectable changes in global climate for very high wind farm usage, on the order of 10% of the world's land area. Wind power has a negligible effect on global mean surface temperature, and it would deliver "enormous global benefits by reducing emissions of and air pollutants". Another peer-reviewed study suggested that using wind turbines to meet 10 percent of global energy demand in 2100 could actually have a warming effect, causing temperatures to rise by in the regions on land where the wind farms are installed, including a smaller increase in areas beyond those regions. This is due to the effect of wind turbines on both horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulation. Whilst turbines installed in water would have a cooling effect, the net impact on global surface temperatures would be an increase of . Author Ron Prinn cautioned against interpreting the study "as an argument against wind power, urging that it be used to guide future research". "We’re not pessimistic about wind," he said. "We haven’t absolutely proven this effect, and we’d rather see that people do further research".
Impacts on people.
Safety.
Operation of any utility-scale energy conversion system presents safety hazards.
If a turbine's brake fails, the turbine can spin freely until it disintegrates or catches fire. This is rare and the odds of a major turbine fire or disintegration is in the order of 0.001% over the 20-25 year lifespan of a modern wind turbine. Some turbine nacelle fires cannot be extinguished because of their height, and are sometimes left to burn themselves out. In such cases they generate toxic fumes and can cause secondary fires below. However, newer wind turbines are built with automatic fire extinguishing systems similar to those provided for jet aircraft engines. These autonomous systems, which can be retrofitted to older wind turbines, automatically detect a fire, order the shut down of the turbine unit and immediately extinguish the fires completely.
During winter ice may form on turbine blades and subsequently be thrown off during operation. This is a potential safety hazard, and has led to localised shut-downs of turbines.
Modern turbines can detect ice formation and excess vibration during operations, and are shut down automatically. Electronic controllers and safety sub-systems monitor many different aspects of the turbine, generator, tower, and environment to determine if the turbine is operating in a safe manner within prescribed limits. These systems can temporarily shut down the turbine due to high wind, ice, electrical load imbalance, vibration, and other problems. Recurring or significant problems cause a system lockout and notify an engineer for inspection and repair. In addition, most systems include multiple passive safety systems that stop operation even if the electronic controller fails.
Aesthetics.
Newer wind farms have larger, more widely spaced turbines, and have a less cluttered appearance than older installations. Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing and they coexist easily with other land uses (e.g. grazing, crops). They have a smaller footprint than other forms of energy generation such as coal and gas plants. Wind farms may be close to scenic or otherwise undeveloped areas, and aesthetic issues are important for onshore and near-shore locations.
Aesthetic issues are subjective and some people find wind farms pleasant and optimistic, or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity. While some tourism officials predict wind farms will damage tourism, some wind farms have themselves become tourist attractions, with several having visitor centers at ground level or even observation decks atop turbine towers.
Residents near turbines may complain of "shadow flicker" on nearby residences caused by rotating turbine blades, when the sun passes behind the turbine. This can easily be avoided by locating the wind farm to avoid unacceptable shadow flicker, or by turning the turbine off for the time of the day when the sun is at the angle that causes flicker. If a turbine is poorly sited and adjacent to many homes, the duration of shadow flicker on a neighborhood can last hours.
The location of a wind farm is critical to its overall power-generation. Each turbine depends on “micro-sitting,” or the exact position of the turbine, because a difference of 30 m can sometimes double a turbine’s output. Coastal and areas of higher altitude are considered prime for wind farms, due to the constant wind speeds. Hills or ridges cause the wind to accelerate as it is forced over the higher altitude, increasing wind speed. A historical rule of thumb suggests that a site is not ideal for wind-farm usage unless it exhibits average wind speeds of 10 mph or higher. Both locations tend to be areas of high tourism and aesthetic pleasure, causing many local communities to protest the development of wind farms. Coastal regions, however, tend to be highly populated, thus requiring more energy. While small wind farms can connect to the local electricity distribution grid, locating large wind farms in rural areas increases the cost and complexity of transferring generated power to population centers. Both the proximity to densely populated areas and the necessary wind speeds make these locations ideal for wind farms.
Wind towers require aircraft warning lights, which may create light pollution. Complaints about these lights have caused the FAA to consider allowing fewer lights per turbine in certain areas.
Noise annoyance.
In 2011, the "British Acoustics Bulletin" published the 10th independent review of the evidence on wind farms causing annoyance and ill health in people. And for the 10th time it has emphasised that "annoyance has far more to do with social and psychological factors in those complaining than any direct effect from sound or inaudible infrasound emanating from wind turbines". Two factors repeatedly came up. "The first is being able to see wind turbines, which increases annoyance particularly in those who dislike or fear them. The second factor is whether people derive income from hosting turbines, which miraculously appears to be a highly effective antidote to feelings of annoyance and symptoms".
A 2009 expert panel review, sponsored by the Canadian Wind Energy Association and American Wind Energy Association, delved into the possible adverse health effects of those living close to wind turbines. Their 85-page report concluded that wind turbines do not directly make people ill. The study did allow that some people could experience stress or irritation caused by the swishing sounds wind turbines produce. "A small minority of those exposed report annoyance and stress associated with noise perception..." "Annoyance is not a disease." The study group pointed out that similar irritations are produced by local and highway vehicles, as well as from industrial operations and aircraft.
The 2009 study panel members included: Robert Dobie, a doctor and clinical professor at the University of Texas, Geoff Leventhall, a noise vibration and acoustics expert in the United Kingdom, Bo Sondergaard, with Danish Electronics Light and Acoustics, Michael Seilo, a professor of audiology at Western Washington University, and Robert McCunney, a biological engineering scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. McCunney contested statements that infrasounds from wind turbines could create vibrations causing ill health: "It doesn't really have much credence, at least based on the literature out there" he stated The academic and medical experts who conducted the study stated that they reached their conclusions independent of their sponsors. "We were not told to find anything," said panel expert David Colby, a public health officer in Chatham-Kent and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario. "It was completely open ended."
Eighteen research reviews about wind turbines and health, published since 2003, all showed that there was very little evidence that wind turbines were harmful in any direct way. Simon Chapman, professor of public health at Sydney University, said that if wind farms did genuinely make people ill there would by now be a large body of medical literature that would preclude putting them near populated areas. But this is not the case. Sickness being attributed to wind turbines is more likely to be caused by people getting alarmed at the health warnings circulated by activists. Complaints of illness were far more prevalent in communities targeted by anti-wind groups. Chapman's report concludes "that illnesses being blamed on windfarms are more than likely caused by the psychological effect of suggestions that the turbines make people ill, rather than by the turbines themselves".
Nina Pierpont, a New York pediatrician and wife of an anti-wind energy activist, states that noise can be an important disadvantage of wind turbines, especially when building the wind turbines very close to urban environments. The controversy around Pierpont's work centers around her statements made in a self-published, non-peer-reviewed book that ultra-low frequency sounds affect human health, which are based on a very small sample of self-selected subjects with no control group for comparison. She asserts that wind turbines affect the mood of people and may cause physiological problems such as insomnia, headaches, tinnitus, vertigo and nausea. Simon Chapman has said that "wind turbine syndrome" is not recognised by any international disease classification system and does not appear in any title or abstract in the massive US National Library of Medicine's PubMed database. He says that the term appears to be spread by anti-wind farm activist groups. The 2009 expert panel review found that "wind turbine syndrome" symptoms are the same as those seen in the general population due to stresses of daily life, and include headaches, insomnia, anxiety, and dizziness.
A 2007 report by the U.S. National Research Council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so. Low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans. There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans.
In a 2009 report about "Rural Wind Farms", a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach. In July 2010, Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council reported that "there is no published scientific evidence to support adverse effects of wind turbines on health".
In Ontario, Canada, the Ministry of the Environment created noise guidelines to limit wind turbine noise levels 30 metres away from a dwelling or campsite to 40 dB(A). These regulations also set a minimum distance of for a group of up to five relatively quiet dB(A) turbines within a radius, rising to for a group of 11 to 25 noisier (106-107 dB(A)) turbines. Larger facilities and noisier turbines would require a noise study.
A 2008 guest editorial in "Environmental Health Perspectives" published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, stated: "Even seemingly clean sources of energy can have implications on human health. Wind energy will undoubtedly create noise, which increases stress, which in turn increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer."
Modern wind turbines produce significantly less noise than older designs. Turbine designers work to minimise noise, as noise reflects lost energy and output. Noise levels at nearby residences may be managed through the siting of turbines, the approvals process for wind farms, and operational management of the wind farm.
Offshore.
Many offshore wind farms are being built in UK waters. In January 2009, a comprehensive government environmental study of coastal waters in the United Kingdom concluded that there is scope for between 5,000 and 7,000 offshore wind turbines to be installed without an adverse impact on the marine environment. The study – which forms part of the Department of Energy and Climate Change's Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment – is based on more than a year's research. It included analysis of seabed geology, as well as surveys of sea birds and marine mammals.

Tamga (genus)

Tamga hamulifera is a disk-shaped fossil from Precambrian strata of the White Sea area, in Russia.
Description.
The small (3–5 mm in long), disk-shaped fossil has seven hook-like isomers in a star-like arrangement in the clearly expressed peripheral undivided zone. "T. hamulifera" is probably a member of Proarticulata, as it is strongly similar to "Praecambridium sigillum" in the general shape, and the presence of hooklike isomers; "Tamga" is also similar to "Onega stepanovi" in the flattened body with a compact group of ledges-isomers in the central part encircled by an undivided zone.
The fossils of "Tamga" could possibly be sclerites, for example, as sclerites of palaeoscolecids show a similar shape, a disk with a ring or rows of tubercles in the center. But the size of "Tagma"'s fossils is two orders of magnitude less than those of palaeoscolecid sclerites, and no mineralized sclerites of any sort have ever been found or diagnosed in the Vendian–Ediacaran communities.
Etymology.
The generic name is taken from the Turkish word, "tamga", meaning seal or cattle brand. The specific name is a crasis compound word, taken from Latin, of "hamulus" (small hook), and the feminine form of "feros", "to bear." Thus, the scientific name can be translated as a "seal that bears small hooks."

Bridgewater House, Westminster

Bridgewater House is at 14 Cleveland Row, Westminster, London, England. It is a Grade I listed building.
The earliest known house on the site was Berkshire House built in about 1626-27 for Thomas Howard, second son of the Earl of Suffolk and Master of the Horse to Charles I of England when he was Prince of Wales. Howard was later created Earl of Berkshire. After being occupied by Parliamentarian troops in the English Civil War, used for the Portuguese Embassy, and lived in by Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, the house was lived in by Charles II's mistress Barbara Villiers, who was made Duchess of Cleveland in 1670, following which the house was known as Cleveland House. She refaced the old house and added new wings. After being owned for some years by a speculator the house was sold in 1700 to John Egerton, 3rd Earl of Bridgewater, after which it passed by inheritance until 1948.
Cleveland House was re-designed in the Palazzo style by Sir Charles Barry in 1840 and the rebuilding was completed and renamed in 1854 for Lord Ellesmere, heir of the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. It is built in Bath stone with a slate roof in three storeys with a basement. It was famous, in both incarnations, as the site of the Stafford Galley (in Cleveland House) and Bridgewater Gallery (in Bridgewater House), where the collections of paintings of the Duke of Bridgewater and his nephew and heir George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland (whose second son Ellesmere was) were on at least semi-public display. The collection included about 70 paintings from the famous Orleans Collection, some of which are now in the Sutherland Loan to the National Gallery of Scotland. The collection was opened in 1803, and could be visited on Wednesday afternoons over four, later three, months in the summer by "acquaintances" of a member of the family, or artists recommended by a member of the Royal Academy.
The building was damaged in the Second World War and has since been adapted for office use. The painting "Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers", thought lost in the raid, was rediscovered in 2009. In 1981 Bridgewater House was purchased and restored by Greek shipowner Yiannis Latsis, and is still owned by his family.

291 (magazine)

291 was an arts and literary magazine that was published from 1915 to 1916 in New York City. It was created and published by a group of four individuals: photographer/modern art promoter Alfred Stieglitz, artist Marius de Zayas, art collector/socialite/poet Agnes Ernest Meyer and photographer/critic/arts patron Paul Haviland. Initially intended as a way to bring attention to Stieglitz's gallery of the same name (291), it soon became a work of art in itself. The magazine published original art work, essays, poems and commentaries by Francis Picabia, John Marin, Max Jacob, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, de Zayas, Stieglitz and other avant-garde artists and writers of the time, and it is credited with being the publication that introduced visual poetry to the United States.
Background.
Alfred Stieglitz was one of the most active arts promoters in the world in the early 1910s. He was already famous for his own photography, he published the well-known magazine "Camera Work" and he ran the progressive art gallery 291 in New York. After the Armory Show in 1913, a trio of artists and supporters (de Zayas, Meyer and Haviland) gathered around Stieglitz at his gallery, encouraged by his recent interest in promoting other art forms in addition to photography. In January 1915 they proposed the idea of starting a new magazine that would showcase the most avant-garde art of Europe and the U.S., and at the same time bring attention to Stieglitz's gallery. They named the new magazine after the gallery, and with Stieglitz's blessing the four of them began working on the first issue.
Compared with his other publications, Stieglitz was fairly detached from the project. He later said, "I was more or less an onlooker, a conscious one, wishing to see what they would do so far as policy was concerned if left to themselves." Nonetheless, Stieglitz was not one to sit idly aside while something went on around him. He helped set the tone and direction of the magazine, beginning with its design and production.
Wanting to live up to the high standards set in "Camera Work", Stieglitz and his colleagues decided to publish two editions of the magazine: a standard subscription printed on heavy white paper and a deluxe edition, limited to 100 copies, printed on Japanese vellum. Both were published in a large folio format (20" x 12"/50.8 cm x 30.5 cm).
Each issue contained just four to six pages, sometimes hinged together to provide a fold-out spread, and there were no advertisements. Due to its size and cutting edge presentation, it had the look and feel of a work of art itself, not a magazine about art. It has been called a "proto-Dadaist statement" in part because much of the content was in the form of visual poetry, a literary and design format attributed to Picabia's friend the French surrealist Guillaume Apollinaire. The design and layout was inspired by the second series of the magazine "Les Soirées de Paris", edited in France by Apollinaire, and it was de Zayas who brought the concepts from the French magazine and put them into place in the new magazine. Because of these influences art historian William Innes Homer has said "In design and content, there was no periodical in America more advanced than "291".
A regular subscription initially cost ten cents per issue or one dollar a year; the deluxe edition cost five times as much. Little attempt was made to attract subscribers, and no more than one hundred signed up for the regular edition. There were only eight known subscribers to the deluxe edition. 
Stieglitz had 500 extra copies printed of Issue No. 7-8, which featured his photograph "The Steerage". Because it had recently been published for the first time and attracted very positive comments, he anticipated a huge demand for the image. The demand did not materialize, and none of the additional copies was sold. 
Only twelve numbers of "291" were published, but three of them were double numbers so just nine actual issues were printed. It never attracted a wide audience, and the high costs of production became too much to sustain. Stieglitz had hundreds of unsold copies at his gallery when he closed it in 1917; he sold all of them to a rag picker for $5.80.
All issues are highly valued now, and a complete set of the original issues is very rare. One of the complete sets is in the collection of the U.S. Library of Congress in Washington, DC (LC Control No 00204566). A bound reprint edition was published by the Arno Press in 1972 (ISSN 1054-7193) and may be found in large university and public libraries.

The Canary Murder Case (film)

The Canary Murder Case (1929) is a crime/mystery film made by Paramount Pictures, directed by Malcolm St. Clair and Frank Tuttle. The screenplay was written by Willard Huntington Wright (as S.S. Van Dine), Albert S. Le Vino, and Florence Ryerson, based on novel "The Canary Murder Case" by S.S. Van Dine. It was the first film in the series of Philo Vance films adapted from the novels, starring William Powell as Philo Vance, Louise Brooks as the Canary, and Jean Arthur as Alys LaFosse.
Production.
This film was initially made as a silent picture, then reworked as a sound film. Louise Brooks' refusal to cooperate in the sound version had a major impact on her career.
After filming the silent version of "The Canary Murder Case," Brooks left for Germany to make two films for director G. W. Pabst. Her option with Paramount Pictures was up, and since the studio would not give her a raise, she saw no reason to remain in Hollywood. Months later, Paramount decided to re-shoot some scenes of "Canary" with recorded dialogue. The studio cabled Brooks in Berlin, demanding that she return to record her lines. She refused, taking the position that she no longer had an obligation to Paramount. Under the purported threat that she would never work in Hollywood again after such open defiance, she bluntly replied, "Who wants to work in Hollywood?" 
Paramount spent considerable money to hire actress Margaret Livingston (the "Woman from the City" in F.W. Murnau's "") to dub the dialogue for Brooks in "Canary" where possible, as well as to re-shoot some scenes, with Livingston seen only in profile or from behind. The golden age of German cinema soon ended with the rise of Nazism, and Brooks found herself back in Hollywood. She was never able to get good roles there again and soon retired. Though her time as a star was over, her battle with studio moguls helped add to her eventual legend.

Turya River

Turya () is a river in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia. It is a right tributary of the Sosva, and is 128 km long, with a drainage basin of 1,160 km². 
The river has its sources in the boggy regions east of the central Ural Mountains. It flows eastwards through a relatively open and somewhat boggy landscape, and flows into the Sosva some 25 km east of Krasnoturyinsk. The river is 10-40 meters wide. It freezes over in late October, and stays frozen until late April or early May. Along the Turya lie the towns of Krasnoturyinsk and Karpinsk.
In 1943 a dam was built across the river at Krasnoturyinsk. The resulting Bogoslovskoye Reservoir is 18 meters deep, about 0.5 km wide and 8 km long, and stretches to the neighbouring town of Karpinsk. Later, more dams were built upstream.
The river is polluted as a result of nearby industries, like the Bogoslovsky Aluminium Plant, a chicken factory, and a power plant, in addition to runoff from the towns of Krasnoturyinsk and Karpinsk.

Tarot Nouveau

The Tarot Nouveau, French Tarot Nouveau or Bourgeois Tarot deck is a general style of tarot playing card deck. The Tarot Nouveau differs from other styles of tarot deck, such as the Tarot of Marseilles and Rider-Waite decks, in that the Tarot Nouveau is designed solely for playing the various tarot card games for which the 78-card tarot deck was originally devised, such as French Tarot. In the French language, this deck is often called the tarot à jouer or playing tarot. This usage is distinct from cartomancy and other divinatory purposes, for which the tarot is most commonly known outside of Continental Europe.
Origin.
This pattern is said to have originated in the late 19th century with the C.L. Wüst cardmaker of Frankfurt Germany. This earlier edition lacked the corner indices found on the later 20th century version published by French cardmakers such as Grimaud, but the values of trumps changed from Latin numerals common on older decks to Arabic numbers used in modern writing. These numerals were placed in the center of the panels in a Fraktur font similar to cards which were used for the German Tarock game of Cego. In the early 1900s, French cardmakers such as Grimaud appropriated this pattern and would later add the corner indices now found on most modern card decks.
Cards.
The cards bear the French suits of Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs, rather than the Italian suits of Swords, Cups, Coins and Wands (typical in tarot decks used for cartomancy) or the traditional German suits of Hearts, Bells, Acorns and Leaves (commonly seen on Tarock and Skat decks in East Germany, Austria and Hungary). The "pip" and court cards of the Tarot Nouveau (which are called the Minor Arcana in cartomancy) are similar in format to those of the traditional 52-card Anglo-American deck, with the addition of the Knight ("Chevalier") face card. 
The "atouts" or trumps depict genre scenes of whimsical early 19th-century social activities of the well-to-do European "bourgeoisie", hence a common alternate name for this deck, the "Bourgeois Tarot". This is in contrast to the "trionfi" of Italian Tarocco decks and the Major Arcana of "esoteric" decks used for cartomancy, which have allegorical illustrations and, in cartomancy, interpretive meaning.
All cards use corner indices as opposed to the top-center indices of older tarot decks and their "esoteric" descendants used for readings; this allows the cards to be held in a single hand as is required for many card games. They also include reversible art for court and trump cards while traditional and modern reading tarots have full-length character art.
Composition.
The Tarot Nouveau deck, like most (but not all) tarot decks, is composed of 78 cards. 56 are suited in the traditional French suits, with 14 cards per suit; ten "pip" cards with values 1-10 (the Ace bears the number 1 instead of the familiar "A", and usually ranks low), and four court cards: Jack ("Valet"), Knight ("Chevalier" or "Cavalier"), Queen ("Dame") and King ("Roi"). The other 22, shown in the top two rows of the image below, are the 21 "atouts" or trumps and one Fool. The deck is thus primarily different from the 52-card Poker deck in the existence of the separate trump "suit", and the addition of the Knight court card. With these cards removed the deck is identical to the Anglo-American deck for playing purposes. The Fool, though similar in appearance and function to the Joker card of poker decks, has differing origins (see Joker for more information).
Trumps.
The 21 trumps in a "Tarot Nouveau" deck each have two scenes taking up the graphic portion of the card, in a roughly reversible fashion (one scene is always face-up), but unlike the court cards which have similar reversible art, most of the cards' scenes are not rotationally symmetrical. Instead, one scene shows an "urban" representation of a particular trait or idea (listed below), while the other side depicts a more "rural" interpretation. The scenes depicted are as follows:

Medbourne railway station

Medbourne railway station was a station in Medbourne, Leicestershire, on the Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway.
History.
The railway was opened in 1879 and the station in 1883 when the Great Northern began running between Leicester Belgrave Road and Peterborough North. This service was taken off and Medbourne station closed as a war economy in 1916, the track having by this time been singled. Shortly after the station closed, it was accidentally burned down. After 1916, the track was only used for goods, but survived until 1964.
Medbourne was also served by Ashley and Weston railway station on the London and North Western Railway. This station was known as Medbourne Bridge until 1879.

The Mind Research Network

The Mind Research Network (MRN) was founded in 1998 as a result of the vision of United States Senator Pete Domenici to establish a leading brain research facility to be based in New Mexico. MRN’s initial plan called for the research and development of state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalogram neuroimaging systems in the studies of mental illness and brain disorders. This important task was carried out by MRN and its collaborators at Harvard University, MIT, the University of Minnesota, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of New Mexico.
While still referred to as the MIND (Mental Illness and Neuroscience Discovery) Institute, the organization moved to their current location in the Pete & Nancy Domenici Hall on the University of New Mexico campus in 2004. Their name change to MRN was completed in the fall of 2007.
Headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico, MRN consists of an interdisciplinary association of scientists located at universities, national laboratories and research centers around the world and is focused on imaging technology and its emergence as an integral element of neuroscience investigation.
MRN is 501(c)3 non-profit funded through major grants from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, private foundations, collaborative partners and individual donors.
Mission statement.
The Mind Research Network is dedicated to the discovery and advancement of clinical solutions for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of mental illness and brain disorders.
Research.
Since 1998, MRN has evolved into a multi-million dollar organization whose research mission has expanded to include addiction, autism, psychopathy, creativity, dementia, traumatic brain injury, and schizophrenia. A sampling of MRN’s research is described below.
Schizophrenia: 
MRN is addressing this severe mental illness through the following separate, but interconnected research programs:
Psychopathy: 
Understanding the mental processes behind illegal behavior is the first step in providing better therapy for inmates, which will help reduce recidivism rates and decrease the cost of criminal behavior to society. This research utilizes MRN’s one-of-a-kind mobile MRI unit, which is driven from site to site and located inside the grounds of adult correctional facilities and juvenile detention centers.
Traumatic Brain Injury: 
TBI has been described as a “hallmark injury” of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Diagnosis of traumatic brain injury is complicated by the lack of truly objective criteria. Current clinical tools lack the sensitivity to accurately diagnose these injuries. However, MRN’s research is currently utilizing newer neuroimaging techniques to investigate the neuropathalogy of acute mild to moderate TBI and the subsequent recovery of function in this population.
Positive Neuroscience: 
The positive neuroscience initiative was created to bring to light individual differences in aspects of human behavior that provide positive benefits to society, as related to:
Neurodevelopment: 
The neurodevelopment initiative was developed to optimize the use of the unique babySQUID MEG system in order to develop sensitive measures of brain dysfunction early in life and to provide appropriate and early intervention. It is currently being used to identify:

The Scarifyers

The Scarifyers is an audio adventure and comic book series produced by Bafflegab Productions and based on stories written by Simon Barnard and Paul Morris. Set in 1936 and 1937, it originally followed the exploits of DI Lionheart and ghost-story writer Professor Edward Dunning, as played by Nicholas Courtney and Terry Molloy (it may be no coincidence that 'Edward Dunning' is the name of the protagonist of M R James' ghost story, 'Casting the Runes', a man knowledegable about the occult).
Each adventure is a self-contained story and is released on CD and direct download. The first two stories, "The Nazad Conspiracy" and "The Devil of Denge Marsh", were broadcast on BBC7 in 2007. A third story, "For King and Country", guest-starring Gabriel Woolf, was released in early 2008 and broadcast in 2009. The fourth story "The Curse of the Black Comet", guest-starring Brian Blessed, was released in 2009 and broadcast in 2010. The fifth story, "The Secret Weapon of Doom", guest-starring Leslie Phillips and Nigel Havers, was released in 2010 and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in early 2012.
In 2011, after the death of actor Nicholas Courtney, it was announced that David Warner would be joining the series. His first Scarifyers story, "The Magic Circle", centred around the disappearance of Lionheart, and introduced new lead character Harry Crow, Lionheart's former police colleague. It was released in November 2011 and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2012. The seventh Scarifyers story, "The Horror of Loch Ness", was released in June 2012 and features the final performance of Philip Madoc. An eighth adventure, 'The Thirteen Hallows' featuring "Torchwood"s Gareth David-Lloyd was released in December 2012.

Tian Chengsi (田承嗣) (705 – March 4, 779), formally the Prince of Yanmen (雁門王), was a general of the Chinese rebel state Yan, who later submitted to and became a general of Tang Dynasty, from which Yan had rebelled. As was in the case of several other Yan generals who submitted to Tang but who had substantial army and territorial holdings, Tian was allowed to retain his command and territory, semi-independent of the Tang imperial government structure, and among these generals, he was particularly defiant of the Tang imperial government.
Background.
Tian Chengsi was born in 705, during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang. His family was from Ping Prefecture (平州, roughly modern Qinhuangdao, Hebei), and his ancestors, for several generations, had served in the military. His grandfather Tian Jing (田璟) and father Tian Shouyi (田守義) both had reputations for upholding justice in the region. Late in the reign of Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Emperor Xuanzong, Tian Chengsi served as a forward commanding officer under the general An Lushan, the military governor ("jiedushi") of Fanyang Circuit (范陽, headquartered in modern Beijing), and particularly impressed An with his ability to maintain strict military discipline. For his contributions in campaigns against the Khitan and the Xi tribes, he was promoted several times, eventually to be a general under An.
During Anshi Rebellion.
An Lushan rebelled against Emperor Xuanzong's rule in late 755 and, on his campaign south to attack the Tang eastern capital Luoyang, had Tian, along with An Zhongzhi and Zhang Xiaozhong, serve as his forward commanders. An's forces quickly captured Luoyang, and he declared himself the emperor of a new state of Yan there. In 757, after An Lushan had been assassinated and succeeded by his son An Qingxu, Tian continued to serve under An Qingxu and commanded a campaign to capture the key Tang city of Nanyang (南陽, in modern Nanyang, Henan) and then to attack south further, but while he trapped the Tang commander Lu Jiong (魯炅) in Nanyang, he was not able to capture the city quickly, and after Lu eventually fought his way out of the siege and fled to Xiangyang, Tian abandoned the campaign as well and returned to Luoyang.
In fall 757, a joint Tang and Huige army commanded by Li Chu the Prince of Chu (the son of Emperor Xuanzong's son and successor Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an, forcing An Qingxu to flee north of the Yellow River. At that time, Tian was attacking the Tang general Lai Tian (來瑱) at Yingchuan (潁川, in modern Xuchang, Henan), and upon hearing the news, he initially offered to surrender to the Tang general Guo Ziyi, but after Guo did not react immediately, Tian changed his mind and fled north as well with another Yan general, Wu Lingxun (武令珣) to join An Qingxu at Yecheng.
In fall 758, Tang forces closed in on Yecheng. An Qingxu had himself, Tian, and Cui Qianyou (崔乾祐) command the Yan army to fight against the converging Tang forces, but Tang forces defeated them, forcing them to withdraw within the city to defend against the siege. It was only in 759, when Shi Siming, fought an inconclusive battle near Yecheng that forced Tang forces to withdraw that the siege on Yecheng was lifted. Shi then killed An Qingxu and took over the Yan throne himself, and Tian continued to serve under Shi. Shi soon advanced south with Tian as a forward commander and recaptured Luoyang. In winter 760, as part of a campaign to capture Tang territory, Shi sent Tian to the Huaixi region (淮西, i.e., modern southern Henan), but little is known about how successful the campaign was.
Shi Siming was himself assassinated by his son Shi Chaoyi in 761, and Shi Chaoyi took the throne. After a Tang and Huige joint force again recaptured Luoyang in fall 762, Tian withdrew his force and joined Shi Chaoyi at Wei Prefecture (衛州, roughly modern Puyang, Henan) to fight against the Tang forces commanded by Pugu Huai'en, but Pugu defeated them, forcing them to further flee north. Yan generals began to desert Shi Chaoyi en masse, but for some time, Tian did not, and by the time around new year 762, he was under siege in Mo Prefecture (莫州, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) with Shi Chaoyi. He proposed to Shi Chaoyi that Shi Chaoyi head to You Prefecture (幽州, i.e., the headquarters of Fanyang Circuit) to seek reinforcements, and that he would stay and defend Mo Prefecture. Shi Chaoyi agreed, but as soon as Shi Chaoyi left Mo Prefecture, Tian turned against him and surrendered Mo Prefecture to Tang, presenting Shi Chaoyi's empress dowager, empress, and children to Tang. Shi Chaoyi, finding the situation hopeless, committed suicide in flight.
The Tang imperial government was unsure as to what to do with the main Yan generals who surrendered and feared that removing them would lead to another rebellion. At Pugu's suggestion, Li Chu, who had by this point succeeded Emperor Suzong as emperor (as Emperor Daizong), made four key Yan generals — Tian, Xue Song, Li Huaixian, and An Zhongzhi (whose name had been changed to Li Baochen by this point) — military governors and allowed them to keep their armies and posts. In Tian's case, he was given five prefectures, which were made into Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei).
After Anshi Rebellion.
It was said that Tian Chengsi emphasized greatly on military strength, that as soon as he had full control of Weibo Circuit, he imposed heavy taxes and conscripted the men for the army and logistics service — and that within a year, his army was some 100,000 strong. Among this he selected an elite group, known as the "Yabing" (牙兵), to protect himself. The four former Yan generals formed alliances among themselves, as well as with two other military governors, Li Zhengji and Liang Chongyi, hoping to be able to pass their territories to their descendants, semi-independent of the Tang imperial government, retaining their armies and taxes without submitting them to the imperial government. As part of this alliance, Li Baochen's brother Li Baozheng (李寶正) married Tian's daughter.
By 773, Tian was demanding to be given an honorary chancellor title, and he had also built a temple dedicated to the four Yan emperors (An Lushan, An Qingxu, Shi Siming, Shi Chaoyi). Emperor Daizong sent an eunuch messenger, Sun Zhigu (孫知古), to Weibo to persuade Tian to destroy the temple. When Tian did, Emperor Daizong rewarded him with the honorary chancellor title of "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事), and also created him the Prince of Yanmen. In 774, Emperor Daizong also promised to give his daughter Princess Yongle to Tian's son Tian Hua (田華) in marriage, hoping that this will improve the relationship with Tian, but Tian became increasingly arrogant thereafter.
Meanwhile, Tian's alliance with the other generals was disrupted by his actions. Xue Song, who controlled Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in Anyang, Henan) had died in 773 and was initially succeeded by his son Xue Ping, who however yielded then to Xue Song's brother Xue E. In spring 775, however, Tian induced the Zhaoyi officer Pei Zhiqing (裴志清) to expel Xue E and submit to him. Tian thus captured Zhaoyi's capital prefecture Xiang Prefecture easily. He was then able to seize three more of Zhaoyi's six prefectures, while the imperial government retained the two other prefectures and merged it with the nearby Zelu Prefecture (澤潞, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), maintaining the name of Zhaoyi for the merged circuit. Meanwhile, he also looked down at both Li Baochen and Li Zhengji. In or shortly before 775, there was an incident where Li Baozheng and Tian's son Tian Wei (田維) were playing polo at Weibo, when an accidental collision between Li Baozheng's and Tian Wei's horses killed Tian Wei. Tian Chengsi, in anger, imprisoned Li Baozheng and sent a messenger to Li Baochen in protest. Li Baochen, wanting to be conciliatory, sent a cane back with Tian's messenger and allowed Tian to discipline Li Baozheng — but Tian, in anger over his son's death, caned Li Baozheng to death, causing Li Baochen to break off the alliance with Tian. He and Li Zhengji, who also felt slighted by Tian, submitted petitions to the imperial government asking to attack Tian, and Emperor Daizong agreed, launching troops from a number of circuits loyal to the imperial government, in addition to Li Baochen's and Li Zhengji's forces, to attack Tian. Li Baochen, Zhu Tao (whose brother Zhu Ci had killed Zhu Xicai in 772, submitted Lulong to Tang imperial authority, and went to Chang'an to serve as chancellor, leaving Zhu Tao in command of Lulong), and Xue Jianxun (薛兼訓) the military governor of Taiyuan Circuit attacked Tian from the north, while Li Zhengji and Li Zhongchen the military governor of Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) attacked Tian from the south. Initially, these joint forces were successful in their attacks against Tian, seizing Ci Prefecture (磁州, in modern Handan) from Tian, but Tian was subsequently able to persuade Li Zhengji to break off his attack, substantially weakening the joint forces. Meanwhile, Li Baochen was offended when an imperial eunuch, Ma Chengqian (馬承倩), who had visited Li Baochen's army, was so dissatisfied with Li Baochen's gift to him that he threw it on the ground, and Tian was also able to use hoaxes to persuade Li Baochen that if he joined forces with Tian to attack Lulong, he would be successful. Li Baochen thus turned against Zhu Tao, launching a surprise attack on him, but was unable to kill Zhu Tao, effectively ending any hopes of the campaign against Tian and subsequently creating an enmity between the Chengde and Lulong Circuits. Tian subsequent ceded Cang Prefecture (滄州, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) to LI Baochen, cementing the reformed alliance and increasing Li Baochen's holdings to seven prefectures. Meanwhile, though, Tian submitted humble letters of submission to Emperor Daizong, offering to visit the Tang capital Chang'an to pay respect to Emperor Daizong. Emperor Daizong agreed, but as soon as Emperor Daizong pardoned Tian, Tian refused to visit Chang'an, and Emperor Daizong did not press the issue. During the campaign, however, Tian also lost Ying Prefecture (瀛洲, in modern Cangzhou as well) to Zhu Tao.
In 776, when Tian Shenyu (田神玉) the military governor of Biansong Circuit (汴宋, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) died, the Biansong officer Li Lingyao (李靈曜) seized control of Biansong and wanted to become semi-independent as well. When the imperial government subsequently mobilized the circuits around Biansong to attack Li Lingyao, of all of the nearby circuits, Tian Chengsi not only did not attack Li Lingyao, but also allied with Li Lingyao, sending an army commanded by his nephew Tian Yue to aid Li Lingyao. Tian, however, was defeated by two generals loyal to the imperial government, Li Zhongchen and Ma Sui, and Li Lingyao was himself soon captured by another general loyal to the imperial government, Li Mian and executed. Tian Chengsi subsequently submitted another apology to Emperor Daizong, and Emperor Daizong, feeling that he had no strength to attack Tian again, pardoned him again and did not require him to visit Chang'an.
Meanwhile, while Tian Chengsi had 11 sons, he considered Tian Yue to be more capable than his sons, and therefore designated Tian Yue as his heir and had his sons serve as Tian Yue's assistants. When he died in 779, at his request and the urging of Li Baochen's, Emperor Daizong allowed Tian Yue to inherit his post, as the military governor of Weibo.

Ortho-Vanillin

"ortho"-Vanillin ("2-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde") is an organic solid present in the extracts and essential oils of many plants. Its functional groups include aldehyde, ether and phenol. "ortho"-Vanillin, a compound of the formula C8H8O3, is distinctly different from its more prevalent isomer, vanillin. The ""ortho"-" prefix refers the to position of the compound’s hydroxyl moiety, which is found in the "para"-position in vanillin.
"ortho"-Vanillin is a fibrous, light-yellow, crystalline solid. Unlike its better-known analogue, "o"-vanillin does not have the characteristic and intense odor of vanilla. Present in a variety of food products, it is not specifically sought after, and is therefore a less-commonly produced and encountered food additive.
History.
"ortho"-Vanillin was first isolated, in 1876, by renowned German chemist Ferdinand Tiemann. By 1910, methods for its purification had been developed by Francis Noelting, who similarly demonstrated its versatility as a general synthetic precursor for a diverse array of compounds, such as the coumarins.
By 1920, the compound began to show use as a dye for hides.
Biological properties.
"ortho"-Vanillin is harmful if ingested, irritating to eyes, skin and respiratory system, but has an unmistakable high of 1330 mg/kg in mice.
It is a weak inhibitor of tyrosinase, and displays both antimutagenic and comutagenic properties in Escherichia coli. However, its net effect makes it a “potent comutagen.”
"ortho"-Vanillin possesses moderate antifungal and antibacterial properties.
Uses.
Today, most "ortho"-vanillin is used in the study of mutagenesis and as a synthetic precursor for pharmaceuticals.

USNS Shearwater (T-AG-177)

USNS "Shearwater" (T-AG-177) was a "Shearwater"-class miscellaneous auxiliary built during the final months of World War II for the US Army as "FS-411" (Design 381 coastal freighter). "FS-411" was Coast Guard manned operating in the Central and Western Pacific, including Hawaii, Saipan, TInian, Guam, during the closing days of the war.
She was placed into service by the U.S. Navy from 1964 to 1969 as USNS "Shearwater" (T-AG-177). After this service, she was transferred back to the U.S. Army.
Operational history as T-AG-177.
"Shearwater" began her naval service as a "survey support ship" with the Military Sea Transportation Service in May 1964. Operated by a Civil Service crew, she operated in the Atlantic Ocean until mid-February 1969, when she was transferred back to the U.S. Army.

Madame Butterfly (1915 film)

Madame Butterfly is a 1915 silent film directed by Sidney Olcott. The film is based upon a John Luther Long novel and the opera "Madama Butterfly".
Production.
Reportedly, leading actress Mary Pickford fought constantly with Sidney Olcott about the character. Olcott wanted Pickford to be more reserved and thought she was "too Americanized to play a Japanese".
Plot.
The film takes place in Japan in 1904. Lieutenant Pinkerton (Marshall Neilan) marries Cho-Cho-San 'Butterfly' (Mary Pickford), a 15-year-old Japanese geisha. Cho-Cho-San is lucky with her new husband and takes the marriage very seriously. Pinkterton, however, regards it as entertainment. He is not in love with her and plans to break off the wedding in a month. The American Consul (William T. Carleton) begs him to break off the wedding as soon as possible, to avoid hurting her feelings. The lieutenant laughs him off.
After Pinkerton forces Cho-Cho-San to end their wedding reception early, her disapproving family disowns her. When Pinkerton is ordered to return to America, he promises Cho-Cho-San he will return before he leaves. Three years go by. Cho-Cho-San, now a mother, still believes Pinkerton will return someday, while he is engaged to an American woman. He sends her a letter to announce he will marry another woman, but Cho-Cho-San can't read.
Meanwhile, The Prince of Japan (David Burton) takes interest in Cho-Cho-San, but she refuses his company and claims she is still waiting for her husband. Sometime later, Pinkerton returns to Japan but he hands the American Consul some money as compensation for Cho-Cho-San and leaves again. When Cho-Cho-San comes to ask about her husband, she runs into Pinkerton's new American wife. The American woman asks Cho-Cho-San to give them her child, as he will be given better opportunities and prosperity under their parenting. Cho-Cho-San is crushed but complies and hands over her child. She kills herself in the final scene by walking into a river and drowning.

Feature Films for Families

Feature Films for Families (FFFF) is a privately owned company that sends out videos that its website, named Family TV, calls "family movies with family values". The company, its owner, and related companies have been the subject of several government and phone company lawsuits concerning deceptive practices and illegal telemarketing, including calling people again who had told the companies to stop calling, and targeting "parents and grandparents" with false "fundraiser" claims after the victims received DVDs and a survey.
History.
Feature Films for Families was based out of Murray, Utah. It initially distributed films that were in the public domain such as "It's a Wonderful Life". It then moved to buying distribution rights. The first film it produced that won an award was "Seasons of the Heart".
Produced and distributed movies.
Feature Films for Families has made several direct-to-video movies. Included are titles such as "The ButterCream Gang", "Rigoletto", "The Velveteen Rabbit", "Picture Perfect", "On Our Own" and "The Retrievers".
Telemarketing and fraud charges.
In 2009, Feature Films for Families and the Dove Foundation together paid $70,000 to Missouri's Merchandising Practices Revolving Fund after using the Dove Foundation to solicit on behalf of the for-profit Feature Films for Families to attempt to evade the Missouri No Call law. Feature Films for Families had created an alliance with the Dove Foundation, a non-profit foundation which is known for its activities of rating, reviewing, and endorsing films. The two companies worked together via telemarketing, but because Feature Films for Families is a for-profit corporation, this allegiance violated Missouri's No Call law.
In 2010, Verizon Wireless filed suit against Feature Films for Families after the company allegedly placed nearly 500,000 illegal automated telemarketing calls in ten days to the mobile phones on Verizon's network. The calls were recorded advertisements for the FFFF film "The Velveteen Rabbit".
In a related suit in May 2011, the Justice Department, acting for the Federal Trade Commission, filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Florida charging Feature Films for Families, Inc., its owner Forrest S. Baker III, and two other companies owned by Baker — named "Corporations for Character, L.C." and "Family Films of Utah" — with "waging deceptive and illegal telemarketing campaigns pitching movies and soliciting for donations, including calls to more than 16 million phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry." The complaint seeks "a court order to permanently bar the defendants from violating the FTC Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, as well as civil penalties, and disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains." Among the behavior described by the complaint:

Joe Bryere

Joseph Bryere (Apr 1859 - 1941), known as Joe Bryere or J.O.A., was a guide in the Adirondacks and a noted woodworking artist whose style played a significant role in creating the rustic, “Adirondack look” we know today. Along with Ernest Stowe, Seth Pierce, George Wilson and other master craftsmen, Joe Bryere helped create the rustic aura so desired in the Adirondack great camps of the late 19th century and early 20th century.
Joe Bryere was born in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, a small community in Quebec Province, Canada. According to the Drouin Collection, the spelling of the Bryere name was interchangeable from Briere to Bryère. Little is currently known of his upbringing, and his family has yet to be definitively established. At least one author has suggested that Joe Bryere's father left the family when Joe was young to seek his fortune in gold-mining, never to return. 
In the early 1880s, Joe Bryere made his way into the United States and eventually to Raquette Lake, located in Hamilton County, New York, in the central Adirondacks. He worked for a few years on Camp Fairview, owned by Charles Durant, cousin of William West Durant. From early on he was known then for his enterprising ability and physical strength. At that time, the Adirondacks were not heavily populated, and many frontiersmen made their claim to land by squatting for long periods of time, in stark distinction from many of the railroad magnates who could own tens of thousands of acres of land in the Adirondacks. 
After moving to the Adirondacks, Joe Bryere met Mary Agnes Gooley, and they were married in 1884 at Ed Bennett's Inn, Under the Hemlocks. They were the first couple known to be married at Raquette Lake. Together they built Brightside on Raquette log by log, living in tents, shacks and eventually in the original hotel they had built together. Brightside was opened in 1891.
Joe became known for his work over the course of his lifetime by crafting numerous pieces of furniture, which he sold or used to furnish Brightside. As Adirondack furniture became more and more popular through the 20th century, the style of his work was duplicated by large numbers of craftsmen. Today, a large collection of his work is on display at the Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake, New York.

Gigolo

A gigolo is a male escort or social companion who is supported by a woman in a continuing relationship, often living in her residence or having to be present at her beck and call. The gigolo is expected to provide companionship, to serve as a consistent escort with good manners and social skills, and often, to serve as a dancing partner as required by the woman in exchange for the support (which is contrary to typical norms). Many gifts such as expensive clothing and an automobile to drive may be lavished upon him. The relationship may include sexual services as well, when he also would be referred to as "a kept man". 
The term "gigolo" usually implies a man who adopts a lifestyle consisting of a number of such relationships serially, rather than having other means of support.
The word "gigolo" may be traced to a first use as a neologism during the 1920s as a back formation from a French word, "gigolette", a woman hired as a dancing partner.

Bridgewater House, Manchester

Bridgewater House, Manchester is a packing and shipping warehouse at 58–60 Whitworth Street, Manchester, England. It is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. 
Bridgewater House was built as a shipping warehouse in 1912 to a design by Harry S. Fairhurst. It is built around a steel frame with a cladding of sandstone ashlar and white glazed terracotta in a large rectangular plan, with a loading bay at the rear. The building has eight storeys and a basement and 19 bays. The lower two floors are of stone, and the upper floors are of terracotta. Above the doorways are profile medallions of the Duke of Bridgewater. According to the architectural historian Clare Hartwell, Fairhurst's huge buildings are "steel-framed and built to high-quality fireproof specifications". The authors of the "Buildings of England" series state that "Fairhurst's design revolutionized the business of loading and unloading goods and twenty-six lorries could be dealt with simultaneously using a drive-through system".
The building was constructed for Lloyd's Packing Warehouses Limited and, like many warehouses, was built to a common design with steps to a raised ground floor with showroom and offices. The first floor contained more offices, waiting rooms for clients, and sample and pattern rooms all decorated to impress customers. The working areas above were plain with large windows to allow in natural light. Orders were packed there and sent to the basement on hoists powered by Manchester's hydraulic power system, and packed into bales using hydraulic presses before dispatch. The warehouse was lighted by gas.
As of 2012 the building, converted to offices, is owned by Bruntwood.

Richard Bergenheim

Richard Bergenheim (1948 – July 20, 2008) was the former editor of The Christian Science Monitor, and President of The First Church of Christ, Scientist.
Career.
After receiving a master's degree in English at the University of Birmingham in England, Bergenheim taught English at the Daycroft School, quitting after two years quitting to become a Christian Science practitioner in 1974. In 1982, he became a Christian Science teacher.
Bergenheim was editor of the Monitor during the kidnapping of correspondent Jill Carroll in Baghdad, Iraq by insurgents in January 2006. Bergenheim, who served as editor for three years, worked with FBI agents and other officials for Carroll's release. She was held for almost three months, and her Iraqi interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, was killed during her abduction.
Carroll had been a freelancer at the time of her capture. Bergenheim immediately placed her on staff so she would be eligible for financial compensation for the kidnapping. When Carroll returned to the United States in April 2006, Bergenheim was one of the first to greet her with a hug at Logan Airport.
Bergenheim, who was a member of the church's Board of Directors from 1992 to 1994, came from a publishing family. His father, Robert C. Bergenheim, founded the Boston Business Journal and was publisher of the Boston Herald American. The elder Bergenheim had covered Boston City Hall for the Monitor in the 1950s and was later manager of the Christian Science Publishing Society.

Alpha generation platform

An alpha generation platform is a technology solution used in algorithmic trading to develop quantitative financial models, or trading strategies, that generate consistent alpha, or absolute returns. The process of alpha generation refers to generating excess returns. Alpha generation platforms are tools used by hedge funds, banks, CTAs and other financial institutions to help develop and test quantitative trading strategies. Alpha generation platforms support quants in the creation of efficient and productive quantitative trading strategies.
Traditionally, quants have used tools such as MATLAB, R, C++ and other computer programming languages to create complex trading strategies that help them perform high-frequency trading. However, as market data volumes increase and more traders create financial models that deal with multi-asset class data, news sentiment data and more, quants must spend a large amount of time programming models, debugging code, and integrating multiple market data sources. This is why some firms have begun adding alpha generation platforms to their quant infrastructures.
These platforms are often seen as a complement to traditional quantitative tools as they can help quantitative analysts process huge volumes of market data. With many of these platforms, users can write out models in English, program models using the platform's supported computer languages, or import strategies written in MATLAB, C++, R and other languages. Alpha generation platforms also often include data integration and storage capabilities through built-in database solutions that capture, standardize and store massive volumes of financial tick data.
Methodology.
Alpha generation platforms are used to locate excess return in the capital market. They enable the development of mathematical and statistical models that help determine whether or not a specific investment may be profitable. In some quant-driven funds, these models make the final decision on whether to buy or sell an investment.
These systems cannot be fully trusted and require qualified quantitative analysts to try to prevent massive drawdowns. The dangers of relying upon a "platform" as illustrated in the paper by Andrew Lo.
The average quantitative strategy may take from 10 weeks to seven months to develop, code, test and launch. It is important to note that alpha generation platforms differ from low latency algorithmic trading systems. Alpha generation platforms focus solely on quantitative investment research rather than the rapid trading of investments. While some of these platforms do allow analysts to take their strategies to market, others focus solely on the research and development of these highly complex mathematical and statistical models.

Niklas Eklund

Niklas Eklund (born 1969) is a Swedish trumpeter. He was born in Göteborg (Gothenburg) into a musical family; his father, Bengt, was a noted trumpeter and conductor. Eklund studied with his father, as well as at the School of Music and Musicology of Göteborg University.
Further studies took place under the tutelage of Edward H. Tarr at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. After five years as solo trumpeter with the Basel Radio Symphony Orchestra, Eklund left the orchestra in the autumn of 1996 to pursue a solo career. Since then he has appeared with many leading musicians and conductors, including Cecilia Bartoli, Zubin Mehta, John Eliot Gardiner, Heinz Holliger, Andras Schiff, Ivan Fisher and Gustav Leonhardt.
In 1996, Eklund won first prize at the first Altenburg International Baroque Trumpet competition, held in Bad Säckingen, Germany.
As a specialist on the notoriously difficult baroque trumpet, he demonstrates exceptional interpretive skill coupled with a high degree of control and precision. Christopher Martin, Principal Trumpet of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, says: "Niklas Eklund's Art of the Baroque Trumpet series Naxos, is the most lyrically gorgeous trumpet playing you'll ever hear." 
Eklund has played an extensive part in the "Bach Pilgrimage" series of performances and recordings directed by Sir John Eliot Gardiner (available on Deutsche Grammophon Archiv CDs), beginning in the year 2000. Besides giving concerts in Sweden and Europe, Eklund has appeared as a guest performer and teacher in the USA, Australia, the Ukraine, Russia and New Zealand (condensed from the artist's website).

Leon &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Whittaker

Leon "Pee Wee" Whittaker (1906 – July 22, 1993) was an African American musician from the Mississippi River delta country of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas who was particularly known as a trombonist of jazz, blues, and rock music. From 1919 until his death, Whittaker performed with minstrel shows, carnival bands, swing orchestras, and rhythm-and-blues groups. He played alongside Louis Armstrong, Louis Jordan, and Jerry Lee Lewis.
Born in Newellton in northern Tensas Parish in northeastern Louisiana, he was the only child of Tom and Kizzie Whittaker. His parents separated, and Kizzie, herself a talented musician, took Pee Wee on a musical tour until he could enter school. While he was in elementary school, Pee Wee lived with his maternal grandfather, who played the violin. He also studied under a Professor Smith from Alcorn State University (then Alcorn State College) near Lorman, Mississippi. He learned how to read music and to master the clarinet, guitar, string bass, and mandolin, as well as the trombone.
Between 1917 and 1918, the Whittakers moved north to Lake Village in southeastern Arkansas. His mother left her musical career when she was called to the Missionary Baptist ministry. After he graduated from high school, Whittaker joined the family band as the mandolin player. A friend and school mate, Louis Jordan, in time became a successful saxophone player, singer, songwriter, and band leader. 
The Whittakers moved thereafter to Greenville, the seat of Washington County in western Mississippi. He played string bass in a band led by trombonist Tullus Washington. About 1925, the Washington family moved to Chicago, and the band dissolved. In 1927, Whittaker joined the Harry Walker band and was away from home for some eight years. In 1935, Whittaker left the Walker band and hitchhiked to Monroe, the seat of Ouachita Parish in northeastern Louisiana. There he and Jordan joined F.S. Wolcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels and toured along the Mississippi River from 1935 to 1950.
In the early 1950s, as a result of volatility in the music industry, Whittaker settled in El Dorado in southern Arkansas. There he formed a band that played small circuits. In 1954, Whittaker and his whole band moved to Ferriday in Concordia Parish. From 1955 to 1963, Whittaker played with Doc Morris and his band, who were associated with a small circus based in Michigan. They traveled into Canada and Great Britain. Whittaker retired from the circuit in 1963 and spent his last years in Ferriday, a majority African American community, where he performed with the Natchez blues band, Hezekiah and the Houserockers. He also played on a Ferriday radio station and at the club known as Haney's Big House. 
In 1982, Whittaker was inducted into the Hall of Master Folk Artists at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches. In 1990, he received the first "Delta Folklife Festival Living Tradition Award", an honor given to a resident who has contributed to the cultural heritage of the Louisiana Delta region. In March 2002, Whittaker was posthumously inducted, along with the Ferriday cousins Jerry Lee Lewis, Jimmy Swaggart, and Mickey Gilley, as the first entries in the Delta Music Museum in the downtown historic district of Ferriday. Whittaker was married and had one son. Whittaker donated a trombone displayed on a wall in the museum.

Recreate 68

Recreate 68 was an umbrella group of leftist American political groups that protested at the August 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado and 2008 Republican National Convention.
Origin.
The group was co-founded and organized by Mark Cohen, Glenn Spagnuolo, and others.
Intentions.
The group stated it would "make the 1968 Democratic National conventions protests look small in comparison". In March 2008, the group lost a lottery drawing for a permit to stage protests in the Civic Center, and the spokesman for the group, Glenn Spagnuolo, stated he would not "give up Civic Center to the Democrats", and that the city was creating a "dangerous situation."
Groups involved or supporting.
Leslie Cagan, who heads the anti-war group United for Peace and Justice, has endorsed the planned demonstrations in Denver. Code Pink stated it would participate in the rallies, hoping to pressure Democratic majorities in the U. S. Congress to do more to end the then ongoing war in Iraq.
Reaction.
Denver city officials met with the groups leaders in late June 2008, hoping to minimize conflict, and considered a resolution created by the group, guaranteeing their first amendment rights during the convention week.
Some left wing political pundits criticized the group and its planned activities, saying that the events they wished to recreate were not beneficial for either the anti-war movement or Democratic Party in the United States. The group rejected allegations that they intend to re-create the violence of the 1968 convention riots, stating "We don’t call ourselves ‘Re-create Chicago ’68,'"

Tubby's

Tubby's is the name of an American restaurant chain based in Clinton Township, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. Founded in 1968 in nearby St. Clair Shores, the chain operates more than 70 stores throughout Michigan, primarily in the Detroit metropolitan area. The chain primarily serves submarine sandwiches and salads, along with soft drinks, french fries and soup, and is known for its grilled subs.
History.
Tubby's was founded in 1968 in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. Founder Richard Paganes, who was 21 at the time, had previously worked at another local sub shop called Super Sub Shop, and decided to open his own sub shop. The site of the first Tubby's was chosen after Paganes found himself stopped with a flat tire in front of a building that was for rent. By early 1968, the first Tubby's was opened. It sold twenty-five different varieties of sandwich, most grilled. He soon opened three more locations nearby, and eventually enlisted the help of his brother Robert. By 1977, the chain had grown to ten locations, and was incorporated as Tubby's Sub Shops, Inc. The first franchised location opened in Madison Heights, and several other locations began offering dine-in as well as carry-out; the Westland location was the first to feature a drive-thru window.
By 1986, with fifty locations at the time, the company had gone public. Shortly afterward, the chain acquired a local restaurant called Ricky's Dairy Bar and Luxury Grill. This concept was franchised as well. Tubby's merged with New Jersey-based Stuff Yer Face, Inc., and was renamed as Tubby's, Inc. Paganes then became chairman and CEO of Tubby's, Inc., although he was replaced one year later by Alexander Bardy as CEO.
1990s and 2000s.
In 1994, Tubby's also started a concept called Tubby's Café Express, which operated inside five local Sears department stores, including the ones at Fairlane Town Center in Dearborn and Oakland Mall in Troy. They also proposed another prototype, drive-thru-only location, and opened locations on the campuses of Wayne State University in Detroit and Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, as well as one located inside a Detroit hospital.
Later in 1994, however, Bardy was ousted and replaced with Paganes as CEO, and the Café Express concept was abandoned. Locations were also opened in Florida and Ohio, and the chain began opening locations inside gas stations as well. Their first location outside the United States opened in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1997, followed by outlets in Indiana and Missouri a year later.
After a failed merger with Florida-based Interfoods of America, Tubby's returned to private ownership in 1999. That same year, the chain expanded into Arizona as well. All of the locations outside Michigan were eventually shuttered, however, as the chain chose to focus more on the Detroit area, to compete with national chains such as Quiznos and Subway. A prototype store, the 100th in the chain, opened in Macomb Township in 2001. This was also the first location in the chain to serve pizza.
Menu.
Tubby's offers more than twenty different types of submarine sandwiches, most of which are served grilled. In addition, the chain serves several sides, including french fries, onion rings, potato chips, cheese sticks, and soft drinks.

Boris Kamensky

Boris Sergeevich Kamensky (15 November 1870 – 21 September 1949) was an Imperial Russian violinist.
Born in Nikolaev, Ukraine, son of a Director of a Commercial Bank, Kamensky made his first appearance in concerts at the age of nine. He was noticed as a talented violinist by Eugène Ysaÿe and he started taking lessons with him. He went on to study at the Saint Petersburg State Conservatory (now the Rimsky-Korsakov Saint Petersburg State Conservatory) with Leopold Auer, and he had ensemble classes with Anton Rubinstein; and then he studied with Joseph Joachim in Berlin.
Kamensky was appointed as Concertmaster in the orchestra of the St Petersburg Imperial Russian Musical Society and he became first violin of Tzar Nicholas II. He was one of the founding members of the St Petersburg String Quartet, which was maintained by Helena Pavlovna’s grandson, Duke George Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whilst appearing as soloist at the concerts of the Russian Musical Society in various cities in Russia. The Quartet played old Italian instruments made by the Guarneri family which had taken years for the Duke to find. Despite the exceptional qualities of the instruments, it took over 500 rehearsals before the artists successfully achieved exactly the right equilibrium of tone. The Quartet initially played at the Duke’s palace, where only select society was able to attend. The Duke was encouraged to let the Quartet give public concerts and as a result, it made its début in 1897 in St Petersburg. The Quartet became very famous in Russia and then started touring around Europe.
Kamensky married Maria Apakidze and they had a daughter, Irina in 1907. He was so passionate about his violin that on the eve of the Russian Revolution, when he was forced to leave the country and faced with the choice between taking his wife or his violin, he chose his Stradivarius. He fled to Paris and became a Professor at the Russian Conservatory (now the Rachmaninov Conservatory) and he gave private lessons (pupils included Michèle Auclair, Hansheinz Schneeberger, Nejiko Suwa and Jean Fournier). He subsequently married Ksenia Vladimirovna. Kamensky is buried at the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery in Paris.
Selected performance reviews.
NIZHNY NOVGOROD
"The ensemble of the four artists is simply wonderful. It is impossible to explain in words the perfection of their masterful playing, one must hear them to understand the power and brilliance of their interpretation of the pure quartette music.
They represent one whole, one soul. It seems like one instrument in the hands of a maestro, in whose power it is to easily transmit the musical beauties, enrapturing the audience with the purity of tone, either dying away to the hardly audible pianissimo, or growing to the greatest forte.
Many years work were required to create such a perfect musical ensemble. The execution of the artists merits the highest praise, acquainting the Russian public with the works of the great composers."
POLTAWA
"Nothing surpasses their playing as regard to the ensemble, transparency and artistic interpretation. The four artists play like one person. They master their instruments exquisitely and achieve even a still greater mastery of themselves."
KISHINEFF
"Although their playing sounds like one great instrument, it is nevertheless not a bit mechanical, for each artist retains his own individuality."
OREL
"The concert was of such deep interest, both on account of the serious programme and also on account of the popularity of the artists, that we can note it as one of the most important events in our musical life."
SARATOFF
"I heard the celebrated Quartet for the first time and the impression received excelled by far my expectation. One can hardly imagine a greater harmony of interpretation. Listening to the Quartet I had the impression that I heard a small, wonderfully harmonious orchestra, an orchestra, where every musician is a great and thorough artist.
In forte, the orchestra surprises you with its strength and power and in piano it charms your ear with tenderness of tone and the finest achievement. During the whole performance here is the impression of great nobility and deep reverence for the authors.
There is not the slightest wish of any of the artists to exhibit himself, not the least striving for cheap effects.
Strange as it may seem, this is so seldom found in music."

Back Alley John

Back Alley John (born John Carl David Wilson), (February 10, 1955 – June 22, 2006) was a Canadian blues singer, songwriter and harmonica player.
Beginnings, 1969-1971: Ottawa to Venice, California.
Born into a strict military family in Ottawa, Ontario, the young John Wilson rebelled and ran away from home, travelling to Venice Beach, California at the age of 14 in a stolen truck. He stayed in Venice for approximately two years, making a living as a busking harmonica player, and it was in Venice that he acquired the name "Back Alley John". As his brother, Peter Wilson, recalls, "When he got (to Venice), he needed money and he had been playing harmonica since he was little, so he started busking. The street people there kind of took him under their wing and they said 'Listen John, you can't busk on the street 'cause you'll get arrested. You've gotta busk in the back alleys.' So he busked in the back alleys of Venice for a couple of years and that's how he was named Back Alley John."
1971-1988: Venice to Ottawa and The Back Alley John Revue.
Deported back to Canada, Back Alley John continued to develop his harmonica and singing skills in the Ottawa area. In 1980 together with guitarist Drew Nelson and drummer Sandy Smith a.k.a. "SandyBone", the Back Alley John Revue was formed. They initially played in clubs in Ottawa and nearby towns and often busked on the streets of Ottawa during the early 1980s, particularly on Saturday afternoons in Ottawa's Byward Market, playing blues for passersby in front of the historic Chateau Lafayette House tavern sometimes gathering crowds numbering in the hundreds. Back Alley John's early reputation was enhanced in 1982 when he won the harmonica competition at the Ottawa Bluesfest, where the jury included Kim Wilson and John Hammond. He later performed with Kim Wilson and Hammond at Ottawa's National Arts Centre John identified his influences as including Robert Johnson, Lead Belly, Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Carrie Bell, Johnny Winter, John Hammond, Norm Clark and Dutch Mason.
The popularity of The Back Alley John Revue grew beyond Ottawa. The group toured Canada on several occasions, but did not release an album. In 1987 the band reformed under the name "The Blue Lights" including Sandy Smith back on drums with Drew Nelson and Sue Foley on guitars landing a house gig in Hull, Quebec that was highly frequented by local musicians and many who were on tour. The likes of Jeff Healey, Tom Lavin and "The Maestro" of Koko Taylor's band were among those who showed up to play. It was at this time that The Blue Lights recorded a 45rpm with Greg Labelle's "Lowertown Records" featuring Back Alley's song "Mr. Postman" on the A side and Sue Foley Singing "All By Myself" (credited to Big Bill Broonzy) on the B side.
1988-2006: Calgary.
The Back Alley John Revue ended when Back Alley John fell seriously ill and in 1988 decided to relocate to Calgary, Alberta, to be near his brother Peter.
It was in Calgary that Back Alley John developed his recording career, releasing four independently-distributed albums, and where he continued to develop his reputation as a blues performance artist. His recordings were subject to significant critical acclaim. By 1998, he was considered to have become one of the finest blues recording artists in North America. In 1999, he was a "Canadian Real Blues Award" winner, cited by Real Blues Magazine as the Best Canadian Unsigned Talent. In 2002, Calgary country and blues singer Ralph Boyd Johnson included the original song "(Hard Act to Follow) Back Alley John", referencing rougher elements of Back Alley John's life, on Johnson's debut album, "Dyin' to Go".
Back Alley John remained based in Calgary for nearly twenty years, until his death. During this period, Back Alley John was noted for his generosity in sharing his talent with others.
Illness and death.
Back Alley John's career was cut short by respiratory disease, which resulted in him being in continuous third party care for the last two years of his life. Notwithstanding his physical challenges, which included hepatitis and severe oxygen deprivation, necessitating a wheelchair and constant use of an oxygen tank, Back Alley John literally played the blues until his last breath. He continued to record and to contribute to the recordings of others. Two months before his death, having "flatlined in an ambulance, he somehow made his way to (Calgary's) Ambassador Motor Inn, where he got onstage for a final performance. 'He was so close to the end, really bad off, and I couldn't believe he could play,' (his brother) Peter said. 'It wasn't the John I knew, but he still sounded good. It was impressive, but it was heartwrenching, too.'" As the late Mick Joy, John's last steady bass player, close friend and roommate for seven years recalled, "In the final days, he wasn't getting enough oxygen, but it was amazing. He could barely breathe, but he could always pick up harp and blow the harp fine. It was like a mini-miracle every time."
He died in Calgary, Alberta in June 2006.
Tributes: 2006 and 2008.
On Canada Day, 2006, a memorial concert was held in Calgary in honour of Back Alley John.
In February, 2008, Back Alley John was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame of the Calgary Blues Music Association.
Postscripts.
Back Alley John's music continues to receive national radio play. Holger Petersen, founder and owner of Stony Plain Records, has been particularly supportive, through his Saturday Night Blues program on CBC Radio.

Spinney Hills, East Quogue

Spinney Hills is in East Quogue, New York on the eastern end of Long Island's Pine Barrens region. It is often used as a hiking, hunting, and off-roading area for dirt bikers, quadders, paintballers, and four-wheelers that includes miles of trails with near beach sand consistency. Spinney hills gets its name because of Spinney Road, which used to connect the East Quogue side of the hills to Sears Bellows County Park and Flanders (home of the Big Duck) to the north prior to the construction of the Sunrise Highway New York State Route 27. This region was created by glacial deposits of rock and sand during the last ice age. The sandy soil also absorbs most rainfall so there are few ponds or rivers in the area. There is a shallow glacial well in Spinney Hills known as an aquifer, which is where most of the rainfall in the region is stored. These hills are the continuation of a long east west ridge of hills known as the Ronkonkoma Moraine, which form the 'backbone' of Long Island. Much of this region is undeveloped other than a sand mine to the west and Southampton Pines to the east. There have been large scale legal battles between private real estate companies and the Town of Southampton over the future of the area, being it is one of the last expanses of wilderness left on Long Island. There is a very large native population of white-tailed deer in the region due to lack of natural predators. In the higher elevations small sections of the hills have an almost alpine-desert look, with sandy open plateaus and extremely dwarfed vegetation . The Dwarf Pitch Pine which dominate the region grow not much taller than twenty feet in height due to dry, nutrient-poor soil. There is a desert effect in the Pine Barrens, with relatively higher daytime temperatures and cooler nighttime temperatures than the coast, only a few miles away. There are spectacular views of the Atlantic Ocean and Peconic Bay from certain peaks in this region if one knows where to hike. The consistent ocean breeze at the higher elevations passing through the long brushy needles of the Dwarf Pitch Pines creates a gentle whisping sound, or white noise, adding a peaceful ambience to the big skies and expansiveness one feels in this region.

Anthropomorpha

Anthropomorpha is a defunct taxon which contained the manlike, or anthropoid, apes. 
The order was established by Carl Linnaeus in the first edition of his book Systema Naturae (1735) for genera "Homo" (humans), "Simia" (monkeys and apes in general) and "Bradypus" (sloths). In the 1758 edition of the same book, Linnaeus discarded this name and began to use the word Primates, which has replaced Anthropomorpha completely.
The name is no longer considered valid, as the animals that were included within Anthropomorpha are now believed to belong to multiple clades. For example, two-toed sloths were included within Anthropomorpha, but are now considered to be in the family Megalonychidae, which is not closely related to the primates. The taxon Anthropomorpha was originally proposed by Carolus Linnaeus, although Linnaeus' archenemy, the Comte de Buffon, correctly rejected the combination of sloths and humans within the same order.

The Ehrenfest model (or dog-flea model) of diffusion was proposed by Tatiana and Paul Ehrenfest to explain the second law of thermodynamics. The model considers "N" particles in two containers. Particles independently change container at a rate "λ". If "X"(t) = "i" is defined to be the number of particles in one container at time t, then it is a birth-death process with transition rates
and equilibrium distribution formula_3.
Mark Kac proved in 1947 that if the initial system state is not equilibrium, then the entropy, given by

<doc id="18986584" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18986584" title="Boxing in China">
Boxing in China

Boxing in China began as a street sport in the 1920s, mainly in the port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, where foreign sailors were pitted against local fighters in the ring. The sport grew rapidly and unsupervised by the Chinese government. Chinese boxing style is similar to Western boxing style, with influences from traditional Chinese martial arts.
1950s.
In 1953, at a big competition in the northern city of Tianjin, a boxer died after a bout. Sports authorities were unnerved, and in 1959, as China organized its first National Games, it dropped boxing from the lineup. Mao Zedong was driving the country further into isolation. Fan Hong, a scholar who specializes in China's athletic history, commented, "People believed that boxing was very brutal, very ruthless, and those were said to be the characteristics of capitalism. So it was banned."
1960s and 1970s.
When the Cultural Revolution occurred in China, in 1966, the Communist Party banned competitive sports. After the Cultural Revolution subsided, in 1969, China used Ping Pong matches to reconnect with the world. It was not until the late 1970s that Deng Xiaoping decided that competition might be as good for athletics as it was for the economy. In December 1979, Deng invited Muhammad Ali to the compound housing China's top leaders. The champion boxer hugged Deng. They sat and talked. Later, the word went out and Deng sent the message out that "If we want to win friends, if we want to win respect, we have to win medals".
1980s and 1990s.
In the 1980s, Chinese boxers began training again, after a fashion. Athletes had no bags or gloves. Sandbags were traditionally used instead. Liu Gang was one of the earliest recruits and is now China's biggest promoter.China first competed in boxing at the 1992 Summer Olympics, in Barcelona, where competitors were delighted to face off against Chinese opponents as China had been weak in that sport. The best that their coaches hoped for was that each fighter might stay on his feet a bit longer than the one before him.
2000s.
It was until the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens that Zou Shiming claimed China's first boxing medal. He eventually made it into the semifinals and won a bronze. This achievement was greeted with rapturous applause and Chinese reporters nicknamed him the "Dark Horse" at first because of his underdog status. Later, they tried the "Knight of Lightning" or the "Fox" or, sometimes, the "Pirate", all celebrating his knack for snatching points and peeling away from his opponents' reach. That strategy was helping him win international matches. In Athens, Zou made it to the semifinals, eventually winning a bronze, China’s first in boxing. It was another year before Zou won his first gold medal, at the 2005 World Amateur Boxing Championships, held in the western Chinese city of Mianyang. He was the nation's first amateur boxing champion, and China celebrated.
China's boxing performance improved dramatically at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Zou Shiming won the gold medal in the Light Flyweight (-48 kg) event, and Zhang Xiaoping won the gold medal in the Light Heavyweight (81 kg) event.
On the 24th of November 2012 Xiong Zhao Zhong became the first male boxer from China to win a major pro world boxing title. The fight was well received with many of China's major media organisations hailing the event as a huge success. Due to the overwhelming positive reaction boxing promoters have promised to accelerate the growth of boxing throughout China.

George W. and Nancy B. Van Dusen House

The George W. and Nancy B. Van Dusen House is a mansion in the Stevens Square neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The owner, George Washington Van Dusen, was an entrepreneur who founded Minnesota's first and most prosperous grain processing and distribution firm in 1883. In 1891 he hired the firm of Orff and Joralemon to build a mansion on what was then the southwestern edge of Minneapolis. His house reflects the prosperity achieved by business owners who were making money in the flourishing grain, railroad, and lumber industries in the late 19th century. The mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.
The exterior is built of pink Sioux quartzite quarried near Luverne, Minnesota. The roof and turrets are covered with Maine slate. The mansion is generally within the Richardsonian Romanesque form, but it also has French Renaissance design elements, such as steep roofs, and a soaring, slender turret topped with a copper finial. The interior mixes elements of French, Gothic, Tudor, Romanesque, and Elizabethan styles. It contains ten fireplaces, a grand staircase, large skylights, carved woodwork, parquet floors, and a tile mosaic in the entryway.
George Van Dusen was born on July 10, 1826. He married Nancy Barden, his third wife, on November 29, 1860. He started the G.W. Van Dusen & Co. grain company in Rochester, Minnesota, which merged by 1889 with a Minneapolis company to become Van Dusen-Harrington. This eventually became part of the Peavey Company, acquired by ConAgra in 1982. Van Dusen is credited with naming Byron, Minnesota after the town of Port Byron, New York, where he once lived, though it should also be noted that his father Laurence had been born in Byron Center, Genesee County, New York.
The Van Dusens are said to have survived a tornado that destroyed a previous home and as a result the mansion has some unique features including I-beam construction that supposedly made the home tornado proof. Additionally, tunnels radiated from the building into the yard which may have been for emergency use.
Non-residential use.
After its initial residential use, several non-residential conversions altered the mansion. In 1961 a large modern addition was added to the mansion. Organizations that operated from the mansion over the years include the Hamline University Law School, U.S. Communications, and Horst International Education Center, a predecessor of the Aveda Corporation.
Vacant period and decline.
After the Horsts sold the home for approximately $400,000 it sat vacant from 1987 through 1994. The new owners never raised the capital needed for restoration. During this time some of the woodwork deteriorated, some internal fixtures were pilfered, and attempts were made to remove tiles from fireplaces. Philip Maise, who was restoring another home one street over, tempted to purchase the property after the Stevens Square Community Organization dedicated $300,000 from its Neighborhood Revitalization Program to assist a new owner with restoration. Maise attempted to negotiate an agreeable sale price, and when that failed attempted to purchase the mortgage from underneath the owners. At the last moment, the owners purchased the mortgage themselves and stymied Maise's hostile takeover. It was a few months later that much of the remaining original fixtures were stolen from the home and Maise broke off further attempts to take over the property.
Restoration by Bob Poehling.
In December 1994 Bob Poehling, purchased the property for $210,000. This was reportedly just two weeks before it would have been demolished. After purchasing, Poehling and project architect David Sabaka, oversaw an extensive restoration. This included restoring the exterior finishes, replacing windows, a new heating system, and repairing external and internal doors. Local craftspeople and artisans repaired and refinish woodwork, and a California carpenter replaced staircase balusters and bead molding. The carriage house and grand parlor were modernized to house meetings and events.
Mansion's use in Ponzi scheme.
In April 2008 Poehling sold the mansion for $2.6 million to Trevor Cook. Cook, then a 37-year-old Minneapolis investment adviser, had a trail of regulatory sanctions and lawsuits pending. A week later the property was flipped for the same price into account of Oxford Global Advisors. This was a firm managed by Bo Beckman. Beckman, who claimed to be among the nation's top money managers, steered investors into programs run by Cook in exchange for "rebates." However, lawsuits between parties claims this transfer was fraudulent. 
The odd ownership arrangements and disputes was only a hint that strange dealings were going on. Cook's and Beckman's real intent appears to have been to utilize the prestige of the Van Dusen mansion to entice prospective investors in periodic seminars held at the mansion to promote investing in "The Oxford Group". In reality it was nothing more than one elaborate Ponzi scheme. After pleading guilty in 2010 Cook began serving a 25 year federal prison sentence. Beckman was charged with raising about $47.3 million of the $194 million gathered in the overall fraud and was convicted in June 2012 on fraud and tax charges.

Rock Art Show

The Rock Art Show is a traveling art show, now based in Philadelphia, presented by local radio stations, with art of and by rock musicians. The show features over 150 framed drawings, paintings, lyrics, photographs, animation cels, gold records, concert posters, album art and other art forms. It is curated by Scott Segelbaum.
Formation/Early Days (1992–1996).
The idea for the first Rock Art Show was the brainchild of Scott Segelbaum during his time working at KLSX, a radio station based in Los Angeles, California. The promotion was an annual one week event, usually held at the Directors Guild Building on Sunset Boulevard. During its five-year run, the art show was visited by many high profile guests including : Elton John, Brian Wilson, Stevie Nicks, Mick Fleetwood, Brian Setzer, Graham Nash, Joe Walsh, Peter Frampton, Jon Anderson, and Robbie Krieger. 100% of the art sales went to several AIDS related charities; raising over one million dollars during the show's time in Los Angeles. In 1994, the Rock Art Show was awarded the prestigious 'Best of the Best' Public Service Promotions honor in the 1994 National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Convention. Around the same time, Segelbaum was hired as a consultant for the book "Musicians as Artists" (Journey 1994) a book that showcased works of art by famous musicians.
Greater Media Philadelphia Era (1999–2004).
In 1999, Scott relocated to Philadelphia after being offered a job as marketing director for the classic rock oriented station WMGK, and rock station WMMR. Thus, bringing the Rock Art Show with him. Like the previous shows in Los Angeles, the Rock Art Show in Philadelphia proved to be a tremendous success. The show was able to generate press coverage, as well as raising money for charitable organizations. In 2001, the auction raised more than $60,000.
The Rock Art Show was also awarded the Achievement in Radio (AIR) award in 2001, for “Best Radio Sponsored Community Event of the Year”.
Recent (2004–present ).
In 2004, Scott decided to pursue forming his own business, making the Rock Art Show a national event. That same year, he co-founded Right Brain Revenue, Inc. with business partner Sam Milkman. Currently, Right Brain Revenue, Inc. holds an average of 30-40 of these events a year around the country with various radio stations. Featured in the show are photographs from renowned rock photographer, Baron Wolman, the first chief photographer for Rolling Stone Magazine, as well as famous poster designer, Bob Masse, who has created famous concert posters for various bands from the 60's to the present. The Rock Art Show also features original pop art paintings by Beatle's animator Ron Campbell (Animator). Other artwork displayed are original hand drawn artwork and lyrics, gold records, concert posters, and paintings. The prices of the art carried by the show range from five dollars, to five thousand dollars. 10% of each show's profit goes to a different charity.
Though Scott currently works alone, he recently employed an intern, LJ Furman, who is majoring in the History of Rock 'n' Roll at Indiana University. Dylan Segelbaum and Jake Segelbaum, sons of Scott, occasionally assist Scott with local shows. Scott also hosts a short weekly podcast about Beatles news, which can be subscribed to on iTunes, and can be heard on the Beatles internet radio station, Beatles-A-Rama.

Archaeolemur

Archaeolemur is an extinct genus of lemurs that includes two species, "Archaeolemur edwardsi" and "A. majori". 
The genus was widespread throughout Madagascar through much of the Holocene epoch, and its remains are often abundant at fossil sites across the island. Jungers estimated their body weight to be between 15 and 35 kg. The wide geographical and temporal range of the genus may be attributed its generalist nature. "Archaeolemur" was a semiterrestrial quadruped that spent much of its time on the ground, although it was also well suited to arboreal locomotion. Despite its tendency for a mostly terrestrial lifestyle, it was not as well suited for cursorial locomotion as macaques or baboons, the extant primates the genus is often compared to. When compared to highly terrestrial baboons, "Archaeolemur" had shorter, more robust limbs, smaller digits, and a wider trunk. Its diet is thought to have encompassed a wide range of foods including seeds and savanna plants. The incisors of "Archaeolemur" were enlarged and adapted to remove hard shells and rinds from seeds and fruit. The eurytopic adaptation of "Archaeolemur" may explain why it was one of the last of the subfossil lemurs to have gone extinct. It disappeared from Madagascar around 1047–1280 CE.

He is one of the longest-serving BYU faculty and the longest-serving member of the Church History Department ever. 
Biography.
Cowan was raised in Los Angeles. He is legally blind and has had retinitis pigmentosa since birth, and by 2000 he had lost nearly all vision.
Between his undergraduate and graduate degrees, Cowan served a mission for the LDS Church in the Spanish-American mission, among the Mexican immigrants in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona from 1953 to 1956. On his mission he met Dawn Houghton, and they later married and had six children. 
Education.
Cowan received his Bachelor of Arts in political science at Occidental College in 1958. He received an M.A. in 1959 and a Ph.D. in 1961 in American History, both from Stanford University. In 1959 he received an award from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, selected as one of four visually handicapped students in the United States.
Career.
Since 1961 Cowan has been a professor of Church History and Doctrine at BYU. Cowan received BYU's professor of the year award in 1965. He has taught at the BYU Jerusalem Center and in the spring of 2007 was a visiting professor at BYU-Hawaii. 
Writings.
Cowan helped write the LDS Church's Sunday School manual for 1978–80, on the Doctrine and Covenants and LDS history.
In 1972 the LDS Church planned a new sixteen-volume sesquicentennial history to be published in 1980, and Cowan was commissioned to write about the 20th century. These contracts were all canceled in 1981 but Cowan still completed and published his volume, as "The Church in the Twentieth Century" in 1985.
From 1981-1993 Cowan served as the chair of the committee in charge of preparing gospel doctrine lessons for the LDS Church. Among his books are "Temples to Dot the Earth" (1997), "California Saints, A 150-year Legacy in the Golden State"; "The Church in the Twentieth Century" (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1985); "The Latter-day Saint Century" which covered about the same topic but was written 15 years later. He also co-wrote a book about the international church with Donald Q. Cannon. Cowan, along with Cannon and Arnold K. Garr was one of the editors of the "Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History". He wrote the article on the history of the Church from 1945 until 1990 (or basically as recent as he could at the time) for the "Encyclopedia of Mormonism". He also wrote the articles for History of Temples, Missionary Training Centers, Branch, and Branch President.

William Floyd (mathematician)

William J. Floyd is an American mathematician specializing in topology. He is currently a professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. 
Floyd received a PhD in Mathematics from Princeton University 1978 under the direction of William Thurston.
Mathematical contributions.
Most of Floyd's research is in the areas of geometric topology and geometric group theory.
Floyd and Allen Hatcher classified all the incompressible surfaces in punctured-torus bundles over the circle.
In a 1980 paper Floyd introduced a way to compactify a finitely generated group by adding to it a boundary which came to be called the Floyd boundary.
Floyd also wrote a number of joint papers with J. W. Cannon and W. R. Parry exploring a combinatorial approach to the Cannon conjecture using finite subdivision rules. This represents one of the few plausible lines of attack of the conjecture.

Maurice Isserman

Maurice Isserman (born March 12, 1951) is James L. Ferguson Professor of History at Hamilton College and an important contributor to the “new history of American communism” which reinterpreted the role of the Communist Party USA during the Popular Front period of the 1930s and 1940s. His books have also traced the emergence of the New Left and the decade of the 1960s. He co-authored a biography of Dorothy Healey and wrote an award-winning biography of American socialist leader Michael Harrington. Recently he refocused his work on the history of mountaineering in the Himalayas and the United States. He has contributed editorials and book reviews to "The New York Times", "The Boston Globe", "Newsday", the "Los Angeles Times", "The Nation", and "The American Alpine Review".
Early life.
Isserman was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1951, into a family that would have significant influence on his political and intellectual future. His mother, born Flora Huffman, was the daughter and sister of Quaker ministers and graduated from a Quaker college. She was a social worker for the state of Connecticut. His father, Jacob (Jack) Isserman, was born in Antwerp and came with his family to the US in 1906 at age four, and was later naturalized as a US citizen. He was a machinist who worked at the Pratt and Whitney aircraft factory in East Hartford, Connecticut. 
The Issermans were Jewish; Maurice’s uncle Ferdinand Isserman was a prominent rabbi in St. Louis, Missouri. Another uncle, lawyer Abraham Isserman, was a founding member of the National Lawyers Guild, an active member of the American Civil Liberties Union, and one of the lawyers in the first Smith Act trial in 1949, during which he was cited for contempt, imprisoned afterwards, and disbarred. He also argued for the plaintiff in "Dennis v. United States". After his father's death in 1963, Maurice became close to his uncle Abraham, who took him to one of his first demonstrations, the 1967 March on the Pentagon. 
Isserman’s parents had divorced in 1959, and his mother remarried Walter Snow, a local newspaper reporter, who had been a Communist in the 1930s, and a minor figure on the literary Left (John Reed Club member, and editor of ‘’The Anvil,’’ a midwestern radical literary magazine). They lived in the small town of Coventry, Connecticut, and Isserman graduated from Coventry High School in 1968.
Education.
In fall 1968 Isserman enrolled in Reed College in Portland, Oregon, where he joined the campus chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, and took part in anti-war protests and other New Left activism. In spring 1970, following the U.S. invasion of Cambodia and the Kent State University strike, he dropped out of Reed and joined the Portland Revolutionary Youth Movement (PRYM) collective. PRYM members were involved in anti-war activities, in a local underground newspaper "The Willamette Bridge", and in the local food co-op. After a couple years PRYM disbanded, and Isserman returned to Reed to finish his undergraduate degree, writing a senior thesis on the history of radical American writers in the 1930s. He also worked on another underground newspaper, "The Portland Scribe". He graduated with a BA in history in 1973, and stayed on another year working evenings as a proofreader for "The Oregonian" and days (unpaid) for "The Portland Scribe."
In August 1974 Isserman began graduate work in history at the University of Rochester, working closely with Eugene Genovese and Christopher Lasch. He received his MA in American history in 1976 and his Ph.D. in 1979. His dissertation was a history of American Communism during the Second World War, which became his first published book, "Which Side Were You On?" in 1982.
Academic career.
After completing his dissertation, Isserman began the itinerant career of the young scholar. His first job was a replacement position for a semester at Oberlin College in fall 1979, followed by replacement positions at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, then back to Oberlin. He settled into Smith College from 1982 to 1988, followed by temporary positions at Mount Holyoke College and Williams College. 
During this period a debate broke out over the character of American Communism, and Isserman’s book was one of several criticized by Theodore Draper's two-part attack on the "new history of American Communism" in "The New York Review of Books". As the debate heated up, Isserman criticized books by Draper’s protégé, Harvey Klehr. Isserman returned to the theme with a chapter on the history of the CPUSA's "destalinization crisis" in his second book on the emergence of the New Left, "If I Had a Hammer" in 1987, and in his co-authored work with Dorothy Healey, "Dorothy Healey Remembers," in 1990 (reissued in paperback as "California Red").
Isserman secured a tenure-track position at Hamilton College in 1990, and has remained there since, currently as the James L. Ferguson Professor of History. After the debate over American Communism, Isserman shifted his focus to the history of conflicts between Left and Right during the 1960s in his book with Michael Kazin, "America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s", now in its third edition. He wrote a prize-winning biography of America’s best known socialist of his time, Michael Harrington, leader of the Democratic Socialists of America. Acknowledging the archival revelations following the fall of the Soviet Union, Isserman has credited Klehr and his coauthors with adding an important chapter on espionage to the history of the Communist Party USA. Isserman has also criticized the new Students for a Democratic Society for romanticizing the leadership of the Weatherman faction of the old SDS. In recent years, Isserman has turned to his love of mountaineering to find a fresh focus for his work, authoring "Fallen Giants: The History of Himalayan Mountaineering" with Stewart Weaver, acclaimed as the "authoritative history" of the subject, and a forthcoming book on mountaineering in the United States. He is also writing a history of Hamilton College for its bicentennial in 2012.
Isserman has participated in an exchange at the University of Sussex in fall 1985, a Mellon fellowship at Harvard University, 1992–1993, a Fulbright Distinguished Professorship at the University of Moscow, spring 1997, and an exchange at Pembroke College, Oxford University, fall 2001. He is married and has two children.

Halifax Slasher

The Halifax Slasher was the supposed attacker in an incident of mass hysteria that occurred in the town of Halifax, England, in November 1938 following a series of reported attacks on local people, mostly women.
The incident.
The week-long scare began after Mary Gledhill and Gertrude Watts claimed to have been attacked by a mysterious man with a mallet and "bright buckles" on his shoes. Five days later, Mary Sutcliffe reported an attack on herself. Reports of attacks by a 'mysterious man' with a knife or a razor continued, and the nickname "the Halifax Slasher" stuck. The situation became so serious the Scotland Yard was called in to assist the Halifax police. Vigilante groups were set up on the streets, and several people, mistakenly assumed to have been the attacker, were beaten up; business in the town was all but shut down. Rewards for the capture of the attacker were promised; reports came of more attacks in nearby cities.
In the evening of November 29, Percy Waddington, who had reported an attack, admitted that he had inflicted the damage upon himself. Others soon made similar admissions, and the Scotland Yard investigation concluded there were no "Slasher" attacks. Five local people were subsequently charged with public mischief offences and four were sent to prison.
On 2 December, the "Halifax Courier" ran this story:

Monsters Unleashed

Monsters Unleashed was a black-and-white magazine published by Curtis Magazines (an imprint of Marvel Comics) from 1973-1975. The focus of "Monsters Unleashed" was on Marvel's own monsters: Man-Thing, Werewolf by Night, and Frankenstein's monster. (Each issue featured Frankenstein in the upper left corner, reading a book with the title "Marvel Monster Group.")
The title was an attempt by Marvel to compete with Warren Publishing's successful monster magazine "Famous Monsters of Filmland" ("FMOF"), but with the addition of comics. Simultaneously they were publishing "Monsters of the Movies", which also emulated "FMOF" but did not include comics — only articles and photo features. 
Typically, each issue of "Monsters Unleashed" featured a Man-Thing story, a handful of original horror tales, some pre-Comics Code horror reprints, and possibly an article about monster movies and television shows. The comics were dominant, but each issue provided a more-or-less complete monster-fan experience.
"Monsters Unleashed" was edited by Roy Thomas for the first six issues, succeeded by Tony Isabella, and then Don McGregor for the last two issues. The painted covers were illustrated by the likes of Gray Morrow, Boris Vallejo, Neal Adams, Frank Brunner, Bob Larkin, Richard Hescox, Earl Norem, and Jose Antonio Domingo. The title lasted eleven issues, with one annual.

List of chemical elements naming controversies

The currently accepted names and symbols of the chemical elements are determined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), usually following recommendations by the recognized discoverers of each element. However the names of several elements have been the subject of controversies until IUPAC established an official name. In most cases the controversy was due to a priority dispute as to who first found conclusive evidence for the existence of an element, or as to what evidence was in fact conclusive. This article provides a brief history of these controversies, in order of the atomic number of the elements concerned.
Element 23.
Vanadium (named after Vanadis, another name for Freyja, the Scandinavian goddess of fertility) was originally discovered by Andrés Manuel del Río (a Spanish-born Mexican mineralogist) in Mexico City in 1801. He discovered the element after being sent a sample of "brown lead" ore ("plomo pardo de Zimapán", now named vanadinite). Through experimentation, he found it to form salts with a wide variety of colors, so he named the element panchromium (Greek: all colors). He later renamed this substance erythronium, since most of the salts turned red when heated. The French chemist Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils incorrectly declared that del Río's new element was only impure chromium. Del Río thought himself to be mistaken and accepted the statement of the French chemist that was also backed by del Río's friend Alexander von Humboldt.
In 1831, Sefström of Sweden rediscovered vanadium in a new oxide he found while working with some iron ores. He chose to call the element vanadium after the Old Norse "Vanadís", another name for the Norse Vanr goddess Freyja, whose facets include connections to beauty and fertility, because of the many beautifully colored chemical compounds it produces. Later that same year Friedrich Wöhler confirmed del Río's earlier work. Later, 
George William Featherstonhaugh, one of the first US geologists, suggested that the element should be named "rionium" after del Río, but this never happened.
Elements 41 and 74.
Charles Hatchett named element 41 columbium in 1801 (Cb), but after the publication of the identity of columbium with tantalum by William Hyde Wollaston in 1802 the claims of discovery of Hattchet were refused.
In 1846 Heinrich Rose discovered that tantalite contained an element similar to tantalum and named it niobium.
IUPAC officially adopted niobium in 1950 after 100 years of controversy.
This was a compromise of sorts, the IUPAC accepted tungsten instead of wolfram (in deference to North American usage) and niobium instead of columbium (in deference to European usage).
Elements 70 and 71.
Gadolinite, a mineral (from Ytterby, a village in Sweden), consists of several compounds (oxides or earths): yttria, erbia (sub-component as ytterbia) and terbia. 
In 1878 Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac assumed that ytterbia consisted of a new element he called ytterbium (but actually there were two new elements).
In 1907 Georges Urbain isolated element 70 and element 71 from ytterbia. He called element 70 neoytterbia ("new ytterbium") and called element 71 lutecia. 
At about the same time, Carl Auer von Welsbach also independently isolated these and proposed the names aldebaranium (Ad), after the star Aldebaran (in the constellation of Taurus), for element 70 (ytterbium), and cassiopium (Cp), after the constellation Cassiopeia, for element 71 (lutetium), but both proposals were rejected. 
Neoytterbia (element 70) was eventually reverted to ytterbium (following Marignac) and in 1949 the spelling of lutecia (element 71) was changed to lutetium; although some German chemists still use cassiopium instead of lutetium. 
Elements 103–109.
At the time of their discovery, there was an element naming controversy as to what (particularly) the elements from 103 to 105 were to be called. 
At last, a committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) resolved the dispute and adopted one name. They also adopted a temporary systematic element name. 
IUPAC ratified the name lawrencium (Lr) during a meeting in Geneva; the name was preferred by the American Chemical Society. 
The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (then U.S.S.R., today Russia) named element 104 kurchatovium (Ku) in honor of Igor Kurchatov. But the University of California, Berkeley, U.S.A. named element 104 rutherfordium (Rf) in honor of Ernest Rutherford. 
In 1997 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 104 be named rutherfordium.
The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna named element 105 nielsbohrium (Ns) after Niels Bohr. 
But the University of California, Berkeley named element 105 hahnium (Ha) in honor of Otto Hahn. 
IUPAC recommended that element 105 be named dubnium, after Dubna.
Some suggested the name nielsbohrium (Ns), named in honor of Niels Bohr, others believed this name should be given to element 105 (dubnium), the name being too similar to element 107 (bohrium, Bh). 
IUPAC adopted unnilseptium (Uns) as a temporary systematic element name. 
In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named bohrium. 
While this conforms to the names of other elements honoring individuals where only the surname is taken, it was opposed by many who were concerned that it could be confused with boron. 
Despite this, the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997.
The element was discovered almost simultaneously by two different laboratories. In June 1974, a Soviet team led by G. N. Flyorov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna reported producing an isotope 259106, and in September 1974, an American research team led by Albert Ghiorso at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley reported creating an isotope 263106. 
Because their work was independently confirmed first, the Americans suggested the name seaborgium (Sg) in honor of Glenn T. Seaborg, an American chemist. But this name was extremely controversial because Seaborg was still alive. 
An international committee decided in 1992 that the Berkeley and Dubna laboratories should share credit for the discovery. 
An element naming controversy erupted and as a result IUPAC adopted unnilhexium (Unh) as a temporary, systematic element name. 
In 1994 a committee of IUPAC adopted a rule that no element can be named after a living person. This ruling was fiercely objected to by the American Chemical Society. 
Critics pointed out that a precedent had been set in the naming of einsteinium (Es), element 99, during Albert Einstein's life. In 1997, as part of a compromise involving elements 104 to 108, the name seaborgium for element 106 was recognized internationally.
IUPAC adopted unniloctium (Uno) as a temporary, systematic element name.
In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named hassium (Hs), 
and the name was adopted internationally in 1997.
Post-controversial namings.
While "meitnerium" was discussed in the naming controversy, "meitnerium" was the only proposal and thus never disputed. Elements 110 (Ds, darmstadtium), 111 (Rg, roentgenium), 112 (Cn, copernicium), 114 (Fl, flerovium), and 116 (Lv, livermorium) were named after the end of the controversy.
IUPAC adopted unnilennium (Une) as a temporary, systematic element name. 
In 1997 a committee of IUPAC resolved the dispute and adopted the name meitnerium (Mt).

San Japan

San Japan is a Japanese culture and anime convention held annually in San Antonio, Texas. The event, which debuted in 2008, is San Antonio's first major anime convention and has developed into the largest fan-oriented convention in the city.
History.
The San Japan group was formed in Fall 2005 devoted to bringing Japanese animation & cultural awareness to San Antonio. It was originally intended to debut as a 3-day convention in July 2007 but the event had to be postponed for one additional year due to issues with the original host location. To make up for the postponement, a one-day event called "San Japan : Zero Day Anime" was held at Our Lady of the Lake University, in San Antonio, Texas on November 10, 2007. After a successful one-day convention, San Japan focused on its debut 3-day convention located at the El Tropicano Hotel and San Antonio Municipal Auditorium which was called "San Japan 1.5". It received rave reviews & accolades in its debut.
Next, San Japan sponsored a second one-day convention called "Mizuumi-Con", which was created after the success of "Zero Day Anime" as it happened on March 21, 2009. As of Feb. 2010, the Mizuumi Anime Club has taken over Mizuumi-Con and allowed it to be run entirely by themselves at Our Lady of the Lake University without the assistance of San Japan. Mizuumi-Con is now the second largest anime-focused fan convention in San Antonio with over 2500 people in 2013.
San Japan stayed at the El Tropicano and Municipal Auditorium for a second year in 2009. In Fall 2009, San Japan announced that they moved to a new location over to the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter Hotel which is attached to the Rivercenter Mall. It is located at the heart of the San Antonio River Walk. It stayed in this location for 2 years before having to move after the conclusion of its 2011 convention due to attendance growth. Starting in August 2012, San Japan moved to the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center along with the Grand Hyatt San Antonio Hotel as its permanent location. It has announced its dates up to 2015.
Since its inception, San Japan has a unique way of naming each of conventions to stray from the conventional manner of using a numbering system to identify each year. They announce a unique theme for that convention year. Below is a list of its 3-day convention names and announced themes.
Mascot.
The main female mascot for San Japan is Sana. The 'chibi' mascots names are Hinode (Armadillo), Dios (Bat), & Suzaku (Longhorn).

<doc id="18987141" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18987141" title="Incense in China">
Incense in China

Incense in China is traditionally used in a wide range of Chinese cultural activities including, religious ceremonies, ancestor veneration, traditional medicine, and in daily life. Known as "xiang" (), incense was used by the Chinese cultures starting from Neolithic times with it coming to greater prominence starting from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties.
One study shows that during the Han Dynasty (206 BC – AD 220 ) there was increased trade and acquisitions of more fragrant foreign incense materials when local incense materials were considered "poor man's incense".
It reached its height during the Song Dynasty with its nobility enjoying incense as a popular cultural pastime, to the extent of building rooms specifically for the use of incense ceremonies.
Besides meaning "incense", the Chinese word "xiang" () also means "fragrance; scent; aroma; perfume; spice". The sinologist and historian Edward H. Schafer said that in medieval China:
Chinese censers.
Words meaning "censer; incense burner" are compounds of "lu" ( or ) "brazier; stove; furnace", which was a category of ancient Chinese bronzes. "Xianglu" (香爐, with "incense") means "incense burner; censer" in general. "Xunlu" (熏爐, with "smoke; fumigate; cure (food) with smoke", or 薰爐, with "fragrance (of plants); an aromatic grass, "Eupatorium fortunei"") means "small censer, esp. for fumigating or scenting clothing". "Shoulu" (手爐, with "hand") means "hand-held censer; handwarmer; portable charcoal stove".
The "boshanlu" (博山爐 "universal mountain censer"), which became popular during the era of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141 - 87 BC), displayed a microcosmic sacred mountain (esp. Mount Kunlun or Mount Penglai). These elaborate censers were designed with apertures that made rising incense smoke appear like clouds or mist swirling around a mountain peak.
Uses.
Medicine.
Similar ingredients and processing techniques are involved in production of both incense and Traditional Chinese medicines. For example, take "jiu" (灸 "moxibustion"). Incense is believed to have physiological and psychological benefits. For instance, according to the "Bencao Gangmu" pharmacopoeia, "camphor cured evil vapors in heart and belly, and was especially recommended for eye troubles, including cataract."
Time-keeping.
Along with the introduction of Buddhism in China came calibrated incense sticks and incense clocks ("xiangzhong" 香鐘 "incense clock" or "xiangyin" 香印 "incense seal"). The poet Yu Jianwu (庾肩吾, 487-551) first recorded them: "By burning incense we know the o'clock of the night, With graduated candles we confirm the tally of the watches." The use of these incense timekeeping devices spread from Buddhist monasteries into secular society.
Religion.
"Xiangbang" (香棒, with "stick; club") means "incense stick; joss stick". Two "incense" synonyms specifying religious offerings to ancestors or deities are "gāoxiāng" (高香, ""high incense"") and "gōngxiāng" (供香, ""offering incense"").
The Sunni Muslim Hui Gedimu and the Yihewani burned incense during worship. This was viewed as Daoist or Buddhist influence. The Hui, also known as "White-capped HuiHui", used incense during worship, while the Salar, also known as "black-capped HuiHui" considered this to be a heathen ritual and denounced it.
As an art form.
The Chinese developed a sophisticated art form with incense burning like with tea and calligraphy called xiangdao (稥道). It involves various paraphernalia and utensils in various ceramic containers utilised to burn incense. Examples include tongs, spatulas, special moulds to create ideograms with incense powder, etc. all placed on a special small table. It is most often used as an enhancement to a personal space to accompany other arts such as tea drinking and guqin playing.
Production.
Bamboo processing.
Bamboo species with good burning characteristics are harvested and dried. The most common type of bamboo used for producing the sticks is "Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. pubescens" (茅竹,江南竹) since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick. Other types of bamboos such as "Phyllostachys edulis" (毛竹) may be used, however due to their fiberous surfaces or relatively thin wood producing good bamboo sticks is more difficult. Longer incense stick are produced using cao bamboo(草竹).
The dried bamboo poles of around 10 cm in diameter are first manually trimmed to length, soak, peeled, and then continuously split in halves until thin sticks of bamboo with square cross sections of less than 3mm width have been produced. This process has largely been replaced by machines in modern incense production.
Incense materials.
Chinese incense is made from diverse ingredients with much overlap into the traditional Chinese herbal pharmacopoeia. Of all the incense ingredients some of the most commonly used include:
The dried powdered bark of "Persea nanmu"(楠木皮) is used extensively for its mucilaginous qualities, which helps to bind the other powdered ingredients together.
Processes.
Incense powder is formed into the final product through various methods.
Lin-xiang.
Incense powder is tossed over wet sticks
Nuo-xiang.
Incense paste is kneaded around sticks.
Sculpting.
For large incense pillars, incense paste is piled around a single bamboo stick and sculpted to shape
Winding.
Incense paste is extruded and wound to produce spiral incense

Rattlesnake Island (New Hampshire)

Rattlesnake Island is a large island in Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. There are conflicting accounts of where it got its name, because its shape looks somewhat like a snake, but some say it is named for a rattlesnake population that lived there. 
The island is located within the town of Alton.
Topography and physical features.
Rattlesnake Island is about long, and approximately around its shore. The topography varies greatly. Some sections of the island are quite steep, with the land rising dramatically from the shore (and affording spectacular views), while other sections, particularly on the "peninsula", which protrudes from the southerly side of the island, rise gradually. Rattlesnake Island is the highest (in elevation) island on Lake Winnipesaukee. The top of so-called "Mount Rattlesnake" (the top of Rattlesnake Island is not officially named) is high - rising above the mean lake level.
Due to its great height, the island affords wonderful views of the lake. There are hiking trails interconnecting all parts of the island, and these are used frequently by island residents.
Rattlesnake Island Association.
Island property owners are required to join the Rattlesnake Island Association, including payment of modest yearly association dues. In addition to owning land on the island itself, the Rattlesnake Island Association owns a mainland area to the east of Smith Point in Glidden Cove which includes short-term docking, a boat launching ramp, and two large parking areas for residents and guests. There is also an area for the parking of boat trailers.
Electric power and wired telephone service is available to all parts of the island. However, as of 2011 no other land-based services such as cable TV are available.
Conservation land.
At one time, interior lots were to be sold for development. However, this did not occur, and the interior of the island is now set aside as a conservation area. The easterly half (more or less) of the island's interior is owned by the Lakes Region Conservation Trust, while the westerly portion of the interior is owned by the Rattlesnake Island Association. The Lakes Region Conservation Trust maintains a dock at the far southeastern end of the island, and Conservation Trust members are permitted to dock there and access the hiking trails.

Phantasmagoria in Two

"Phantasmagoria in Two" is a song that was composed by Tim Buckley, as opposed to the Larry Beckett/Tim Buckley collaboration that was more commonly credited during Buckley's earlier years, and released (with Once I Was) as the third and final single from his second studio album, Goodbye and Hello. The song - which is dominated by hauntingly psychedelic intertwining guitar and piano sequences - is lyrically much like the majority of the other Buckley solo compositions of the time (such as Pleasant Street, Once I Was and Wings), with less of a specifically metaphoric and more of a purely ambiguous approach to the topic in question. However, despite these lyrical similarities, musically, it is perhaps the most deeply psychedelic of Buckley's published recordings.
Indeed, when recorded in June 1967, it was the height of the psychedelic era and yet despite being very much of its time, the single failed to reach anything like a significant chart position.
A slower, live version of the song was performed during his 1968 concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, England, released in 1990 as . This performance was also included on the 2001 compilation album .
Covers.
The song was covered by the British musician Neil Halstead on the 2000 tribute album "" which was contributed to by a series of other artists.
It was also covered by the American musical duo Arborea on their 2011 album "Red planet".

Berliner-Joyce OJ

The Berliner-Joyce OJ was a U.S. observation aircraft built by Berliner-Joyce Aircraft.
Development and design.
The OJ was a two-seat twin-float biplane with a fabric covered fuselage and staggered wings. The prototype designated XOJ-1 first flew in May 1931. It was designed to meet a United States Navy requirement, BuAer Design No. 86, for a lightweight observation biplane that could be used from catapults on light cruisers. The other design built to this same plan was the Keystone XOK-1, the sole prototype serialled "A-8357". It first flew on 5 January 1931, but was destroyed in a crash 15 April 1931, during a demonstration before naval officials when a piece of its NACA-style engine cowling detached itself, smashed into the wings and tailplane, causing the airframe to break up in flight. Although the test piloted successfully bailed out, with the Berliner-Joyce XOJ-1 and Vought XO4U-1 (built to a slightly different specification) nearly ready for trials, BuAer decided to discontinue XOK-1 development.
After winning the competition against Keystone, an order for 18 aircraft production aircraft designated OJ-2 was placed with Berliner-Joyce by the Navy in March 1932. Two follow on orders were placed, one in May 1933 for nine aircraft and a further 12 aircraft in December 1933 for use by reserve units. A request for a modified version designated XOJ-3 which was to have a partially closed canopy and other improvements was abandoned.
Operational history.
The OJ entered service with VS-5B and VS-6B in 1933 mainly for use on "Omaha" class light cruisers. Some OJs were used by reserve units with the first being VN-6R which were based near Washington to train reserve pilots and to enable staff officers to maintain their flying categories. By 1936 all the remaining aircraft were operated by reserve units and at the outbreak of the Second World War 29 aircraft were still in service. The Navy stopped the overhaul program for the aircraft and by the middle of 1941 all of them had been struck of charge. 
Unusually for its generation, only four aircraft were lost in accidents without any loss of life.

A wet-bar is a small bar used for mixing alcoholic beverages, which differs from a regular bar in that it includes a sink with running water. A wet-bar can increase the rate at which drinks are served because of the sink, which allows for glasses to be cleaned immediately. The sink may also be used for adding water to drinks.
Wet-bars are found in homes for entertainment purposes. A finished basement is a typical location for a wet bar. Wet-bars are relatively simple to build, and, thus, many homeowners have turned the wet-bar into a do-it-yourself project. Recently, hotels have been incorporating wet-bars into rooms, in which case the customer must pay to use the wet bar per drink. Including a refrigerator beneath the bar or cabinet is a popular option. This is useful for making chilled drinks and preserving previously made mixtures.

Pauline Chan Bo-Lin

Pauline Chan Bo-Lin (; May 23, 1973 – July 31, 2002) was a Chinese actress who aroused significant attraction and controversies in the Greater China Area during her active years in the 1990s.
Career.
Born in Shanghai, Chan's parents divorced when she was very young and she immigrated to Hong Kong with her mother at the age of 12. She started to work as a part-time fashion model at the age of 15 and contested in the 1990 Miss Asia Pageant. Chan did not win any title in this contest but her buxom figure, 175-centimeter length and mature look drew the attention of local pornographic film industry. She entered this industry in 1991 at only 18-year-old, mainly for her mother's expectations to finance their family. Until 1997, Chan showed up in more than 25 Hong Kong Category III films and gained widespread attraction for her bold performance, becoming a prominent sex symbol in the Greater China Area at that time.
Downfall.
In 1997 Chan began a relationship with the playboy Taiwanese investment tycoon and celebrity Huang Jen-chung (黃任中, also credited as Wong Yam-Chung in Cantonese) whom she met in 1993, and was 33 years older than she was. She moved to Taipei to cohabit with Huang until they broke up in early 1999. After her death, in a media interview Huang revealed that Chan had been involved in drug abuse and sorcery since 1998; Chan did so in anticipation to soothe herself and win his heart back during their emotional low tides.
Between 1998 and 2001 Chan was involved in a chain of negative news. She attempted suicide during a TV interview, repeatedly attacked people, undressed in public, tried to enter foreign countries without valid travel documents and was deported as a result, set fire to her residence, and was frequently hospitalized for drug abuse. In December 1999 she was briefly imprisoned in the United Kingdom for beating an unrelated person in public. This behavior practically ended her acting career.
Death.
Chan hit rock bottom and secluded herself in Shanghai. Her final stage appearance was a bit role in a Taiwanese TV series in March 2002. She gave birth to a baby boy in early July 2002 out of wedlock. Around PM 5:30 on July 31, 2002 Chan jumped out of her 24th-floor apartment window to her death: in her suicide note she cited her postpartum depression as a reason for suicide, and besides expressing her deepest sorrow and blessing to Huang Jen-chung, she also asked everybody to seek her son's father, a Chinese American disk jockey in Taipei. Her funeral was a high-profile Buddhist ceremony on August 3, 2002 and her body was cremated.
Chan was portrayed posthumously by Chinese actress Crystal Sun (孫亞莉), who ever played a bit role in the 1996 movie "", in the 2002 biopic "Pauline's Life". Sun later also committed suicide in 2009 in part due to her debts.

Greetings from the Shore

Greetings From The Shore is a 2007 American coming-of-age romantic comedy film directed by Greg Chwerchak. The movie has played over 60 festivals, winning over 20 awards. It had its American theatrical release on September 12, 2008, on a limited basis.
The film is set (and was shot) on the New Jersey shore, mainly in Lavallette.
Plot.
Still reeling from the death of her father, a young girl spends one last summer at the Jersey Shore before heading off to college. But when her plans fall apart, the girl stumbles into a mysterious world of Russian sailors, high-stakes gambling, and unexpected love.
Reception.
Critical response.
When the film was released Neil Genzlinger, the film critic of "The New York Times", was critical of the actors experience, writing, "The problem with having a big-name actor in your small film is that he tends to underscore the inexperience of some of your other stars. That’s the effect Paul Sorvino has in "Greetings From the Shore," a watchable-enough summer-at-the-beach tale billed as Gabrielle Berberich’s first feature as writer and producer...until Mr. Sorvino, a real actor and a good one, shows up. He plays a down-on-his-luck fisherman who takes the girl under his wing, and he makes Ms. Shaw and some of the other cast members look like amateurs. The director, Greg Chwerchak (who also gets a writing credit), doesn’t help; he allows several secondary characters to become thudding clichés, trampling the delicate story."
Film critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of the web based "Spirituality & Practice", discussed the basic theme of the film, "Jenny's summer teaches her to go with the flow when her life plan is upset. She also learns that the universe is set up in such a felicitous way that when a door closes, a window opens."
Critic David Hiltbrand liked the film, writing, "It's a formulaic and familiar plot, the Jersey girl version of "The Flamingo Kid". But it unfolds smoothly, thanks to Greg Chwerchak's focused direction. And the water down on Barnegat Inlet Island looks oddly idyllic on film. "Greetings From the Shore" is well-acted, including by newcomer Shaw, who has an appealing, wide-eyed innocence reminiscent of a young Meg Ryan. This is a two-hankie weeper that doesn't really earn its tears. But it's a sweet little movie nonetheless."

Symphyotrichum sericeum

Symphyotrichum sericeum is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by several common names, including western silver aster and silky aster. It is native to the central plains of North America. 
Distribution.
"Symphyotrichum sericeum" is an aster of rocky prairies, wood glades, and gravel hill prairies. It ranges from the eastern tall grass prairies and west in the short grass Great Plains to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains of the from Texas and New Mexico into the central grasslands in Canada. Its occurrence is rare in the northeast part of its range. It is seldom found outside its preferred habitat. 
Description.
The "Symphyotrichum sericeum" plant is distinctive in the wild due to the silky texture; no other American aster is sericeous throughout. This is a perennial herb growing from rhizomes. The stem is erect, sometimes branching. It is sericeous (silky) throughout, giving the stem a silvery-grey appearance. Basal leaves are oblanceolate in shape and have petioles. Cauline leaves, those growing along the stem, are ovate to ovate-lanceolate in shape, with alternate attachment to stem, sessile, acuminate at the base, acute at the tip. Leaf margins are entire, or smooth and lacking teeth or serration. Leaf texture is sericeous adaxally (above) and abaxally (below), giving the leaves a silvery-grey appearance. 
Compared to other American asters, the flowers appear disproportionately large for the plant's size. The inflorescence is terminal, occurring at the top of the stem, and consists of a single head. The involucre is ovate to lanceolate in shape and sericeous. Ray flowers are blue and fertile. Disc flowers are white, with stamens yellow to brown. The fruit is an achene.
Conservation.
"Symphyotrichum sericeum" is listed as a rare species in Indiana, and as a threatened species in Michigan.

List of French submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film

France has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since the conception of the award in 1956. France has been one of the most successful countries in the world in this category, and more than half of their Oscar submissions have achieved Oscar nominations. As of 2012, France has submitted 56 films for consideration. Of these, 35 have achieved Oscar nominations and nine have won the award, not including Honorary Awards.
The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.
The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was not created until 1956; however, between 1947 and 1955, the Academy presented Honorary Awards to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These awards were not competitive, as there were no nominees but simply a winner every year that was voted on by the Board of Governors of the Academy. Three French films received Honorary Awards during this period. For the 1956 Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.
The French submission is decided annually by the Centre national de la cinématographie, affiliated with the French Ministry of Culture.
Submissions.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Before the award was created, the Board of Governors of the Academy voted on a film every year that was considered the best foreign language film released in the United States, and there were no submissions.
France is the only country that has submitted a film every year since the creation of the award in 1956 and also the only country which has been nominated at more than half of the occasions where the award was given.
Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by France for review by the Academy. All submissions were primarily in French, with the notable exception of the Portuguese language "Black Orpheus" in 1959, which was a co-production with Brazil.

Bears in Anchorage, Alaska

There are many grizzly and black bears in Anchorage, Alaska. 
Bear population.
There are between 200 and 300 black bears living in the city, according to a rough estimate given by State of Alaska wildlife biologist Rick Sinnott. DNA studies based on collected hair samples have shown that the city is also home to at least 36 grizzly bears. (That figure, however, is likely an underestimate: hair was collected from only seven of eleven grizzly bears that had been radio-collared in a separate study.) Anecdotal accounts suggest that bear sightings are increasing in frequency, but biologists are skeptical that this increase in observations is indicative of a population increase.
Spawning salmon in Campbell Creek attract many bears to the city from the Chugach Mountains.
Human–bear encounters and management issues.
Though bear populations may not be increasing, human–bear encounters are on the rise. As Anchorage's population has increased and urbanization has removed forest, bears have become easier to spot.
In the late 1990s, Anchorage residents responding to a survey indicated that they wanted more animals, including bears, in the city. It is unclear whether attitudes have remained the same, with some people growing uncomfortable with increasing bear encounters.
Recent laws have made it illegal to put out garbage before the morning of trash day, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has lobbied the city to enforce the law by ticketing. The ADFG has also undertaken a bear education campaign, including sending employees door to door to discourage Anchorage residents from leaving food and garbage out.
In 1995, two runners were killed by a bear just south of the city on the McHugh Creek trail. Two maulings in July and August 2008 were the first maulings in the city proper in modern times.

Christopher Jones (biologist)

Christopher Jones is an American naturalist with a strong interest in health economics, particularly as it applies to improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. In early 2003, he presented a report, first to then-British Chancellor Gordon Brown and then in the House of Commons, that led to policy changes to the maximum allowable number of transferred embryos during the course of a woman's in vitro fertilisation treatment. "The Times" in London reported that Jones' report induced immediate action by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority but divided fertility doctors: half viewed this as a good policy from a public health vantage point, the other half viewed the move as over-regulation in personal affairs. Regardless, Jones showed in a co-authored letter that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine that twins are six-times more likely to occur following in vitro fertilisation, compared with natural conceptions, even when only one embryo was implanted. This led to cost-reductions to the National Health Services of GBP 60 million per year that would otherwise have been spent on ineffective treatments or neonatal intensive care due to excessive numbers of multiple births. He was appointed director of bilateral collaborations at the Center for Study of Multiple Birth, a non-profit devoted entirely to research into the health of multiples. Although few had heard of such a trend in 2003, Jones predicted and found that medical tourism and more particularly reproductive tourism away from the United Kingdom, along with an epidemic of multiple births, would be the likely results of fertility regulation.
Biography.
Jones earned a bachelor's degree with distinction in biology from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1999, where he studied genetics and chronic disease under the supervision of James V. Neel and evolution in classes taught by Richard D. Alexander. 
From 1999, Jones matriculated in Christ Church, Oxford University earning two post-graduate degrees, starting with a Master's in Human Biology. While at Christ Church, he was elected variously to Social Secretary of the Graduate Common Room and Master of the Hawks in the Hood and Bell Club. From 2002 to 2005 he was president of Oxford's controversial banking forum. This forum brought international financial services leaders from around the world to discuss frank academic issues. Attendees included Nobel Laureate Robert Mundell, inventor of the currency known as the Euro. During the Oxford years, Jones won a fellowship from the Bertarelli Foundation in Switzerland, created by Ernesto Bertarelli and Donna Bertarelli Spaeth, to develop a cost-effective framework of fertility treatment that would preserve the dignity of human life. After earning his doctorate in health economics/medical sciences from Oxford, he became a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health.
Patron of the arts.
Jones has taken sabbaticals from time to time to raise funds for his friends in the scientific and bohemian communities, to launch projects of profound scientific and intellectual merit. In 2000, with co-inventors Erik Westerman and Ozzie Johnston (son of The Beach Boys legend Bruce Johnston), Jones invented BUYTV the first mechanism to allow cable viewers to purchase goods and services through their television set, using a set top box. In 2008 Jones assisted his Motown friends to market the Martin Luther King Feature Film in the Gulf, starting in Dubai. Jones led Motown legend Mark Davis, producer of Let's Get It On and the soundtrack to the film "Animal House" to a meeting with His Royal Highness Sheikh Saud of Ras El Khaimeh. In 2009 Jones led a British television delegation to visit His Royal Highness Sheikh Abdulla bin Hamad in the Kingdom of Bahrain.
In Turkey, Jones befriended Grammy-award winning trumpet legend Chris Botti and DJ Filth, an award winning artist from Ireland, whose real name is Phillip, with an award winning Pink Panther sound track. The latter he flew in to France to play at his wedding at Chateau du bas-Miniac, his wife's childhood country home.
Inventor.
With another inventor and colleague, Jones owns a United States Patent for a novel way of freezing specimens, particularly mammalian embryos, and he continues to invent and license products to medical and conservation initiatives. He once joked with Edward DeBono that his cryogenic invention could create a market for "Faberge Embryos".
Predictive modeling.
In 2010, Jones and his team of researchers published a paper describing a virtual tool to predict infertile women's chances of taking home a healthy baby, to an accuracy of 80%. Whereas previously researchers could only provide chances of pregnancy, this take-home baby calculator presents results in terms of a healthy baby who survives 27 days of life. By creating this software, Jones essentially created a novel business model, namely the translation of esoteric population-based data into meaningful recommendations to individual, data-savvy beneficiaries.
Translator of population-based statistics.
Jones was one of the early researchers to link reproductive biology to economics, arriving in 1999 at something called health economics which had been in development for nearly twenty years but which as a field of natural science, remains in its infancy. He made headlines in investor news with the launch of his online take-home baby calculator called For My Odds.
Media.
Jones was in the news following his efforts to promote awareness of medical tourism, a trend whereby individuals from developed countries seek superior or bargain medical treatments outside of their home country, and in locations that are either more affordable or more equipped with specialised care.
Diplomacy.
Jones has remained non-political but rather diplomatic, viewing global harmony as one of the most important challenges of the next century. While he was born in Washington D.C. and has contributed funds to campaigns from New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to President Barack Obama, he has spent half of his life overseas, and has "half mind in Europe". This has led him to bring to the U.S. certain aspects of health economics that work in international settings, and advocate for a renewed foreign policy towards global harmony; that is, improving the health and wellbeing of people and families around the globe so that they can thrive with dignity and economic opportunities. In Paris, he was asked to be co-Founder of the UNESCO sponsored World Academy for New Thinking, an initiative founded in Malta by Edward DeBono. His love for connecting individuals who share unusual interests has led to the creation of several well known brands. His banking forum established a new form of academic-industry-government collaboration, leading to inter alia what is now called CapitOx.
Teacher.
Dr. Jones has joined the faculty of the University of Vermont College of Medicine where he will teach Health Economics from January 2012. 
Father.
A European traveler and avid horseman, Dr. Jones resides in Vermont with his wife Victoria Brassart-Jones and their daughter, Johanna Sanctine-Tabor Marie.

<doc id="18987454" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18987454" title="Vala, or The Four Zoas">
Vala, or The Four Zoas

Vala, or The Four Zoas refers to one of the uncompleted prophetic books by the English poet William Blake, begun in 1797. The titular main characters of the book are the Four Zoas (Urthona, Urizen, Luvah and Tharmas), who were created by the fall of Albion in Blake's mythology. It consists of nine books, referred to as "nights". These outline the interactions of the Zoas, their fallen forms and their Emanations. Blake intended the book to be a summation of his mythic universe but, dissatisfied, he abandoned the effort in 1807, leaving it unfinished and unengraved.
Background.
Blake began working on "Vala, or The Death and Judgement of the Eternal Man: A Dream of Nine Nights" while he was working on an illustrated edition of Edward Young's "Night Thoughts" after 1795. He continued to work on it throughout the decade but slowly lost confidence that he could complete the work as he was suffering from a deep state of depression. After 1800, he was able to work on it again. The poem was later renamed "The Four Zoas: The torments of Love & Jealousy in The death and Judgment of Albion the Ancient Man" in 1807, and this name is used to describe a second version of the poem with the first completed between 1796 and 1802. The actual manuscript of the poem was written on proof engravings of "Night Thoughts". The lines were surrounded by large designs and there was around 2,000 lines in the original edition of the poem and 4,000 in the second edition. Of Blake's revision to the work, he primarily changed the last two "nights".
"Vala" was much larger than any of his previous works. "Europe a Prophecy" was 265 lines and was printed on copperplates that measured 23 x 17 cm. The plates used to print "Vala" were 41 x 32 cm. The work also took far longer than his previous works; most of Blake's designs were completed within a year, but "Vala" took ten years for the whole process to be completed. A notebook was probably used to draft the poem or the designs of the work, but none survived. One of the manuscript sheets was originally used to create a history of England that was abandoned by Blake in 1793. The work was never put into etching, and the manuscript was given to John Linnell. Portions of the work were later used in his "Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion".
Poem.
The poem is divided into nine "nights". The original edition begins:
In the second "night", the theme of women ruling is discussed but there is an emphasis on how the ability to create constricts them. Humanity is imprisoned by creation, and experience causes great pain:
The final "night" describes Los witnessing a vision of Christ's crucifixion at the hands of Urizen. In response:
"Vala" concludes:
Themes.
Like many of Blake's works, designs in "Vala" depict sexual activity or the genitals of the individual. Blake used these images as part of a general celebration of sex and sexuality. This emphasis on free sexuality occurs in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell", "Visions of the Daughters of Albion", and Blake's designs based on the Book of Enoch. Blake's beliefs emphasised the need for sexual openness in relationships and the lack of jealousy. In "Vala", the idea of jealousy is a central theme and one of the bases for the story.
Between the various editions, the concept of the poem changes. The later edition was on a smaller conceptual scale, and it emphasises the concept of imprisonment found in the "Book of Urizen". The early version emphasised the nature of intelligence and spiritual problems. The later edition placed an emphasis on the idea of renovation being found within Christianity. As Blake revised the poem, he added more concrete images and connected the plot to the histories of the Druids and of the Christians along with adding various locations connected to them. In both editions of the poem, Blake changed his mythological system in the "Book of Urizen" from a dualistic struggle between two divine powers to a struggle of four aspects split from Eternity. These aspects are Blake's Four Zoas, which represent four aspects of the Almighty God and "Vala" is the first work to mention them. In particular, Blake's God/Man union is broken down into the bodily components of Urizen (head), Urthona (loins), Luvah (heart), and Tharmas (unity of the body) with paired Emanations being Ahania (wisdom, from the head), Vala (nature, from the heart), Enitharmon (what can't be attained in nature, from the loins), and Enion (earth mother, from the separation of unity). As connected to Blake's understanding of the divine, the Zoas are the God the Father (Tharmas, sense), the Son of God (Luvah, love), the Holy Ghost (Urthona, imagination), and Satan who was originally of the divine substance (Urizen, reason) and their Emanations represent Sexual Urges (Enion), Nature (Vala), Inspiration (Enitharmon), and Pleasure (Ahania).
Blake believed that each person had a twofold identity with one half being good and the other evil. In "Vala", both the character Orc and The Eternal Man discuss their selves as divided. By the time he was working on his later works, including "Vala", Blake felt that he was able to overcome his inner battle but he was concerned about losing his artistic abilities. These thoughts carried over into "Vala" as the character Los (imagination) is connected to the image of Christ, and he added a Christian element to his mythic world. In the revised version of "Vala", Blake added Christian and Hebrew images and describes how Los experiences a vision of the Lamb of God that regenerates Los's spirit. In opposition to Christ is Urizen and the Synagogue of Satan, who later crucifies Christ. It is from them that Deism is born.
Critical response.
In 1945, Northrop Frye claimed: "There is nothing like the colossal explosion of creative power in the Ninth Night of "The Four Zoas" anywhere else in English poetry." G. E. Bentley, Jr., in 2003, believed that Blake's "most extraordinary achievement" between the "prodigious years" of 1795 and 1800 was "Vala" in addition to claiming that "The poem provides a profound analysis of man's limitations but no hint of escape from the prison".

Television in Thailand

Thailand television broadcasting started broadcasting on 24 June 1955. Color telecasts (PAL, system B 625 lines) were started in 1969. Full-time colour transmissions were launched in 1975. There are currently 6 free-to-air television stations in Thailand.
Television providers.
Subscription providers are available, with differences in the number of channels, capabilities such as the programme guide (EPG), video on demand (VOD), high-definition (HD), interactive television via the red button, and coverage across Thailand. Set-top boxes are generally used to receive these services. Households viewing TV from the internet are not tracked by the Thai government.
Analogue terrestrial television.
This is currently the traditional way of receiving television in Thailand, however it has now largely been supplanted by digital providers. There are 6 channels; three of them are government public-owned by MCOT the 2 television channels terrestrial free-to-air Modernine TV and TV3; TV5, BBTV CH7 are owned by Royal Thai Army; NBT and Thai PBS are fully government-owned. Analogue terrestrial transmissions were scheduled to be switched off in phases as part of the digital switchover, expected to be completed in 2020 as a recommendation from ASEAN, however, it does not come to effect.
Provincial television has been discontinued since 1988, replacing by NBT, which has two hours of local programming in each provinces.
Digital terrestrial television.
In 2005, the Ministry of Information and Culture announced their plan to digitalise nationwide free-to-air TV broadcasts led by MCOT. Trial broadcasts were undertaken, involving one thousand households in Bangkok from December 2000 till May 2001.
In December 2013, NBTC set up series of auction for DTTV. Four types of licenses are offered as followed: HD TV license, SD TV license, News TV license and Children TV license. All the major operators and content owners in the industry won the bid for new licenses e.g. Bangkok Entertainment, Bangkok Radio and TV, Grammy, ThaiRath Group, Nation Group, TRUE Corp etc. According to the license condition, DTTV services will be launched in 2014.
Satellite television.
Thailand's sole satellite television operator, Thaicom launched the TrueVisions service in 1998. It currently holds exclusive rights from the Thai government to offer satellite television broadcasting services in the country through the year 2017. The rights was extended to 2022 recently. Now, big ugly dishes are still found in Thailand.
There are also laws preventing too many advertisements from being aired on both radio and television, similar to the United Kingdom.

Fred Crane (actor)

Fred Crane, Herman Frederick Crane, (March 22, 1918 – August 21, 2008) was an American film and television actor and radio announcer. He is probably best known for his role as Brent Tarleton in the 1939 film, "Gone with the Wind", speaking the opening lines in the movie during the opening scene with Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and Stuart Tarleton (George Reeves).
Biography.
Crane was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1918. Along with his brothers John and Harry, he grew up on General Pershing St. and went to the MacDonough #13 and Alsace Fortier schools. His father was a dentist, whose father and grandfather also were dentists. Fred was to break the trend, getting into acting and football at both Loyola and Tulane Universities. His first job in his teens was working in his spare time for an ice delivery service, back before electric refrigerators had caught on.
Around the time he was 20, his mother gave him that legendary "$50 and a suitcase" to come out to Hollywood and get into motion pictures, impressed that a neighbor's daughter had signed a movie contract, but also knowing that her son had the mettle to perform (on stage at college, and later in film, television and radio).
At first he stayed with relatives as well as taking a job at the local zoo to pay the rent, after which at night he would read books to a relative whose vision was deteriorating. It wasn't too long before he was invited on that fateful trip to Selznick International Pictures, where his cousin, Leatrice Joy Gilbert, (daughter of Leatrice Joy) was going to audition for the part of Suellen in the movie, "Gone With the Wind." He was taking in all the sights and sounds of the studio, when during a discussion, his authentic Southern accent combined with striking good looks landed him a meeting with "Gone With The Wind" first director George Cukor and producer David O. Selznick, which led to a script reading with Vivien Leigh, who had been chosen to play Scarlett O'Hara. Selznick was impressed, and signed Crane to a 13-week contract at $50 a week.
Even though he had not intended to try out for a job that day, Fred's many years of study and immersion into the arts gave him remarkable abilities as a renaissance raconteur, able to recite verse on the spur of the moment, or launch into any one of thousands of songs from the spark of a conversation... and his voice and quick wit helped him meet the challenges of many opportunities, whether acting or as a craftsman.
Fred played the part of Brent Tarleton, one of Scarlett's suitors, and spoke the opening lines in the film. One of the lasting Trivial Pursuit questions was initiated for all time, when an error in the credits listed his name as Stuart, who was actually played by George Reeves, who among his many roles, is also fondly remembered as Superman in the TV series. It was deemed too costly to fix this, so it endures this way, but when watching and listening to the dialogue, it is clear who George and Fred play in the movie. Brent speaks the opening lines of the movie, "What do we care if we were expelled from college, Miss Scarlett? The war's going to start soon, so we would have left college anyhow."
He did not attend the film's 1939 premiere in Atlanta, although he attended the premiere in Los Angeles with his good friend and "twin," George Bessolo Reeves, at Carthay Circle Theatre. In later years (June 1998), he was one of the special guests at the celebrity-studded premiere screening of the restored version of "Gone With The Wind" hosted by Ted Turner in Atlanta.
In 1940, he married his first wife, Marcelle Dudley, and later went on to marry another four times. As he began a family, World War II limited his options as acting work was difficult to come by, and so he began tutoring at Crossroads of the World, one of his film students being Gene L. Coon (well known for his work on the first season of ""), and also working in a munitions factory until the war came to a close.
Shortly afterward in 1946, he interviewed with Errett Lobban Cord, owner of Cord Automobile company, and also of KFAC classical music radio in Los Angeles, and was hired on part-time, (a second vocation attributed to his vocal prowess) for his exquisite speaking voice and extensive familiarity with musical compositions. He had done and continued to do other radio programs simultaneously, such as staff voice actor on "The Jack Benny Program" (on NBC Radio), and other announcing roles. He had mastered a remarkable talent for not only the retention of information, performances and musical acuity in general, but classical music in particular (and the capable pronunciation of all the languages and dialects that entails), partly from his college studies, but also a great deal from being a very dedicated follower of the Walter Damrosch radio program for many of his younger years.
He continued to dabble in film, working on a Cisco Kid film with Leo Carrillo ("The Gay Amigo", 1949), and eventually several TV shows, including guest roles and staff roles on shows such as "Lost in Space", "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea", "Twilight Zone", "Peyton Place", "Lawman", "Hawaiian Eye", and "77 Sunset Strip". He also appeared on "General Hospital" later in the 1970s, and continued taking on occasional jobs in narration.
His family continued to grow, leading him to explore other, more dependable work options as well, as many struggling actors would attest. He spent several years working at a pharmacy, several more years as a fine tools machinist and inspector, and several years in housing construction partnership, all the while working part-time at KFAC until a full-time position opened up in the 1960s.
About a decade later, he was promoted to AM Program Director (Carl Princi was the FM Director) in addition to the duties of performing his 6 hour morning show live ("Hark, the Glad Sounds"), and recording voice tracks and commercials for the all-night show ("Music Out of the Night") for several hours each weekday after his show completed at noon. His show was frequently in the top 5 of drive-time popularity, ranked by polls in the "Los Angeles Herald-Examiner" during that time.
Fred continued with the radio station after it moved from Prudential Square (near Wilshire and La Brea) to new quarters on Yucca St. in Hollywood, until the day when most of the older staff were dismissed without notice in 1987. Those who were fired eventually won their case against this issue in an age discrimination suit. Fred continued to work in radio for several years after that, at KKGO, which was partly jazz, partly classical programming at that time.
He semi-retired in the 1990s, beginning a tour of several years of appearances for fans and special events, as well as cruise ship lectures and continuing on charity fundraisers for PBS station KCET.
The new millennium took him full circle back to the Southern states, where he and his fifth wife, Terry Lynn, bought an antebellum mansion in Barnesville, Georgia and turned it into Tarleton Oaks, a bed-and-breakfast with a "Gone With The Wind" museum, where guests could view artifacts from the film. Tarleton Oaks was sold at an auction in 2007 due to Crane's failing health, and as a part of the experience attendees were treated to a few hours of fond recollections from his early days in the film industry.
Around 2003, Fred had developed difficulties with diabetes, which he unfortunately acquired shortly after his second heart surgery. He'd had successful surgery to repair a vein in his leg, which had limited circulation due to the combination of diabetes and a previous heart operation in which the vein had been removed for heart bypass surgery. Unfortunately, infection had escalated in the leg, prolonging the hospital stay, and he contracted a pulmonary embolism a few days later, passing away at 12:10 p.m. Eastern Time on August 21, 2008.
He was the last male surviving actor who played an adult role in the film, leaving the two remaining males Mickey Kuhn, who played Beau Wilkes as a child, and Patrick Curtis, who was one of several infants who played Melanie's baby in "GWTW".

SLOB

The SLOB (Simple List Of Blocks) allocator is one of three available memory allocators in the Linux kernel. (The other two are SLAB and SLUB). The SLOB allocator is designed to be a small and efficient allocation framework for use in small systems such as embedded systems. Unfortunately, a major limitation of the SLOB allocator is that it suffers greatly from internal fragmentation.
SLOB currently uses a first-fit algorithm, which uses the first available space for memory. Recently a reply from Linus Torvalds on a Linux mailing list was made where he suggested the use of a best-fit algorithm, which tries to find a memory block which suits needs best. Best fit finds the smallest space which fits the required amount available, avoiding loss of performance, both by fragmentation and consolidation of memory.
By default, Linux kernel used a SLAB Allocation system until version 2.6.23, when SLUB allocation became the default. When the CONFIG_SLAB flag is disabled, the kernel falls back to using the 'SLOB' allocator. The SLOB allocator was used in DSLinux on Nintendo DS handheld console.

WNBA Playoffs

The WNBA Playoffs is a best-of-three elimination tournament between eight teams in the Eastern Conference and Western Conference of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), ultimately deciding the final two teams who will play in the WNBA Finals.
Current format.
Following the WNBA regular season, four teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs and are seeded one to four.
Regular season records determine the seedings of the teams in each conference. The team with the best record receives seed one, the team with the next best record receives seed two, and so on.
These seedings are used to create a bracket that determines the match-ups throughout the playoffs. The first round of the playoffs, or Conference Semi-Finals, consists of two match-ups in each conference based on the seedings (1-4 and 2-3). The two winners advance to the second round, or Conference Finals, with a match-up between the 1-4 and 2-3 winners. At the conclusion of the Conference Finals, the winners of these series advance to the WNBA Finals.
The Conference Semi-Finals and the Conference Finals are each best-of-three series. Series are played in a 1-1-1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage (better record) hosts games 1 and 3, while their opponent hosts game 2. The WNBA Finals are a best-of-five series played in a 2-2-1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, and 5 while their opponent hosts games 3 and 4.

USS San Carlos (AVP-51)

USS "San Carlos" (AVP-51) was a built for the United States Navy during World War II. "San Carlos", named after San Carlos Bay, Florida, was in commissioned from 1944 to 1947 and earned three battle stars for service in the Pacific during World War II. After eleven years in reserve, "San Carlos" was converted to oceanographic research ship USNS "Josiah Willard Gibbs" (T-AGOR-1)—named after American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs—and placed in service as a non-commissioned ship of the Military Sea Transportation Service from 1958 to 1971. In December 1971, the ship was transferred to the Hellenic Navy as "Hephaistos" (A413), a motor torpedo boat tender. "Hephaistos" was struck from the rolls of the Hellenic Navy in April 1976.
World War II: Seaplane tender.
"San Carlos" was laid down on 17 September 1942 by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington. She was launched on 20 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Henry D. Batterton, and commissioned on 21 March 1944 with Lieutenant Commander De Long Mills in command.
After shakedown, "San Carlos" departed Southern California on 1 June 1944. Arriving at Green Island on 25 June 1944, she engaged in air-sea rescue operations in the northern Solomon Islands from 26 June 1944 to 3 September 1944, and at Morotai Island, shortly after its capture from the Japanese, from 18 September 1944 to 30 September 1944.
Arriving off Leyte in the Philippine Islands on 18 October 1944 at the beginning of the Philippines campaign, "San Carlos" fueled battleship and cruiser observation floatplanes. She shot down one Japanese plane on 21 October 1944. Arriving at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 24 October 1944, she tended seaplanes there and downed another Japanese plane on 27 October 1944. 
Departing on 4 November 1944, she made a cargo trip to Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, returning to San Pedro Bay on 18 November 1944. Arriving at San Juanico Strait on 22 November 1944, she shot down another Japanese plane on 26 November 1944 and tended seaplanes there until 22 January 1945. After duty at Mindoro Island in February 1945, she tended seaplanes near Cavite, on Luzon, from March 1945 until 11 August 1945.
"San Carlos" arrived at Bremerton, Washington, on 3 September 1945. After overhaul there, she operated out of Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, from December 1945 through May 1946, and out of San Juan, Puerto Rico, from July 1946 to March 1947. Decommissioned on 30 June 1947 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, "San Carlos" was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. "San Carlos" received three battle stars for her World War II service.
Oceanographic research ship.
After eleven years of inactivity, "San Carlos" was taken out of reserve on 11 July 1958 and assigned to the U.S. Navys Military Sea Transportation Service for conversion to an oceanographic research ship by Mobile Ship Repair Company of Mobile, Alabama. Alterations to her original design included the installation of six laboratories, a machine shop, a darkroom, a superstructure deck locker for experimental stowage or work, and a deep-sea winch capable of handling up to 40,000 feet (12,192 meters) of wire rope and 20 long tons (22.4 short tons; 20.3 metric tons) of equipment. In her modified form, she required a crew of 48 and could accommodate a scientific staff of 24.
On 15 December 1958, the ship was renamed USNS "Josiah Willard Gibbs", in honor of American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs and re-designated as an oceanographic research ship, T-AGOR-1. On 18 December 1958, she was placed in non-commissioned service as a United States Naval Ship under control of the Military Sea Transportation Service.
"Josiah Willard Gibbs" became the principal research vessel of the Hudson Laboratories of Columbia University, under contract to the Office of Naval Research. For thirteen years she provided transportation, accommodations, and working spaces for American scientists and technicians investigating physical, chemical, and biological properties of the ocean. She was dedicated primarily to research in the physics of the ocean, particularly the propagation of sound, as part of efforts by the Office of Naval Research to improve the U.S. Navy's submarine and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. Her relatively large size allowed her to handle heavier weights at greater depths and provide greater stability for delicate scientific measurements than any other oceanographic research vessel then in use. Her large deep-sea winch and auxiliary propeller gave her the capability to investigate even the deep ocean trenches scattered throughout the world.
In July 1968, "Josiah Willard Gibbs" surveyed a large fracture zone crossing the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at . This fracture zone was known at the time as Charlie Fracture Zone, after the United States Coast Guards Ocean Weather Station Charlie at . It was proposed that the fracture zone be renamed Gibbs Fracture Zone after the ship, since fracture zones are generally named for research vessels. Currently this fracture zone is referred to as Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone. At in the Caribbean there is a seamount named Gibbs Seamount after the ship.
"Josiah Willard Gibbs" was taken out of service on 7 December 1971 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day.
Hellenic Navy career.
"Josiah Willard Gibbs" was transferred to the Greek Navy on 15 December 1971. She then became the Greek motor torpedo boat tender "Hephaistos" (A413). She was stricken by the Greek Navy in April 1976.

According to twelfth century sources, after the death of Glywys the kingdom was divided into three cantrefi, Gwynllwg, Penychen and Gorfynydd, by his sons Gwynllyw father of Cadoc, Pawl and Merchwyn respectively, though Glwysing still existed and would later become Glamorgan. Gwynllyw gave his name to Newport Cathedral and also to Wentlooge, while Pawl may have been mixed up with Paul Aurelian. 
Glywys' name may be a back-formation from the name of the kingdom and Glywysing's name may continue that of the Romano-British *Glevenses, the territory and citizens of "Glevum", or Gloucester. Such invented founding kings are not uncommon in British genealogy. "Gloucester" ("Glowancestre", 1282) derives from the Old English "ceaster", "fort", preceded by the Roman stem Glev- (pronounced glaiw). In Old Welsh, the city was known as "Caerloyw", "caer" = castle, and "loyw" from "gloyw" = glowing/bright. Hence Gloucester has been given a similar founder, Gloyw: genealogies of Vortigern make him a descendant of Gloyw through his father Vitalus and his grandfather Vitalinus, while a lineage in the "Bonedd y Saint" makes saint Mechyll fab Echwys the grandson of Gwyn Glohoyw and the great-grandson of Gloyw Wallt-Lydan. In the Mabinogi, similarly, Pryderi marries Cigfa, "daughter of Gwyn Glohoyw, son of Gloyw Wallt-Lydan, son of Casnar Wledig". 
Nevertheless Glywys is believed to have become a hermit in his later life and travelled to Cornwall where he founded the church of Penryn. He is sometimes referred to as the Cornish Glywys, "Glywys Cernyw".

History.
Alcovy High School opened to grades 9-12 in the 2006-2007 school year. The school was built to relieve the population of Newton High School and Eastside High School. The school was built with 82 classrooms, and it has room to accommodate up to 2,500 students. The class schedule originally was six periods. In 2009, the Newton County School System changed all high schools to a four-block schedule. In 2011, it changed all high schools to a six-period schedule, which changed graduation credit requirements starting with the graduating Class of 2012. In 2008, the school updated, adding classrooms and a Ninth Grade Academy, which opened in Fall 2010. The graduating Class of 2014 was the first to use it. In 2010, the school was rezoned and students from Newton High School were transferred to Alcovy so that the school system could change Newton into a housing for STEM students going to the career academy in 2013 and onther building was built for newton high school. Alcovy's first graduating class was the Class of 2007. In 2009, Alcovy High served as a filming location for Rob Zombie's "Halloween II", as the exterior of a hospital.

<doc id="18987986" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18987986" title="Serbian identity card">
Serbian identity card

Serbian identity card (Serbian: Лична карта / "Lična karta") is the national identification card used in Serbia. Though the ID card is a primary photo ID, Serbian passport and national Drivers license are used as valid photo IDs for various purposes. It is issued to all Serbian citizens residing in the country above 10 years of age, while it's compulsory for those over the age of 16.
Appearance.
ID card has the same shape and size as many other ID cards, as specified by the ISO/IEC 7810 standard. It features a light red and blue background, colors of the Serbian flag. Obverse background has a picture of a statue on the top of the Serbian government building in Belgrade, while the reverse has the small Serbian coat of arms.
In the chipped card, language used on the form is Serbian (in Cyrillic script) and English, however, personal data is printed only in Serbian Cyrillic. This has caused some controversy, since obviously national ID card will be difficult to use as a valid ID document abroad, except in those countries which also use Cyrillic script. Nevertheless, the chip-less version of the ID card uses Latin and Cyrillic scripts and has the holder's name printed in Latin script. This was done probably due to the fact that the name of the ID card holder is stored in Latin script inside the chip of a chipped card.
Serbian citizens who are members of a national minority have the option to have the form of their ID card printed in Serbian, English and their native language (or Serbian Latin), while personal data will be entered in native language (for example, for Serbian Hungarians, in Latin script Hungarian alphabet, instead of the Serbian Cyrillic). Citizens whose native language is Serbian can opt to have their personal data entered in Serbian Latin, instead of Cyrillic script; however, ID card form will still be in Serbian Cyrillic and English only, as Serbian Latin and Serbian Cyrillic are not considered different languages.
ID card includes the following data:
Bearers signature and fingerprint of the right index finger are also printed on the ID card.
Validity of the document is ten years from the date of handing in the application, while processing time is up to 15 days.
Announced changes.
On July 1, 2013, Serbian Ministry of the Interior announced that there will be certain changes in the design and features of the ID in 2014. Among other things, there is a plan to improve the quality of the holder's photo. All new IDs will contain contact chip (until now there was a possibility of opt out for the chip) and there will also be a RFID chip incorporated in the design. The ID will be readable by passport readers and it could be programmed to contain holder's electronic signature, health insurance data, public transport subscription information, as well as, information usually contained in a driving licence. E-government portals will be made compatible with the new ID design.
Machine readable zone.
The data of the machine readable zone consist of three lines of 30 characters each. The only characters used are those of Serbian Latin alphabet, except for letters with diacritics (ŠĐĆČŽ - they are replaced by the appropriate letter without a diacritical mark), 0-9 and the filler character <.
The format of the first row is:
The format of the second row is:
The format of the third row is:
Chip.
After a long public debate, it has been decided that people will have an option to choose whether to have an ID card with or without the chip, containing the data already printed on the ID card. Those opting for the chip card do not have their place of residence (home address) printed, but it is stored in the chip. The police has provided the public with freeware software to download the data from any ID card to a computer (except for the scanned signature and the fingerprint) using a standard smart card reader. Serbian ID does not feature contactless RFID chip , so it is not fully ICAO9303 compliant biometric travel document. About two thirds of citizens applying for the ID card opt for the chipped version.
Requirements.
To acquire the biometric ID card for the first time, a citizen must present a birth certificate and a proof of citizenship, as well as the expired old style Lična karta. In case of a renewal, only taxes should be paid and new photo will be taken at the police station.
International travel using Serbian biometric ID.
Serbian identity card can be used instead of a passport for travel to some neighboring countries (and territories) of Serbia that have signed special agreements(†) with the Serbian Government:

Copper Inuit

Copper Inuit (or Kitlinermiut) are a Canadian Inuit group who live north of the tree line, in Nunavut's Kitikmeot Region and the Northwest Territories's Inuvik Region. Most historically lived in the area around Coronation Gulf, on Victoria Island, and southern Banks Island.
Their western boundary was Wise Point, near Dolphin and Union Strait. Their northwest territory was the southeast coast of Banks Island. Their southern boundary was the eastern shore of Great Bear Lake, Contwoyto Lake and Lake Beechey on the Back River. To the east, the Copper Inuit and the Netsilingmiut were separated by Perry River in Queen Maud Gulf. While Copper Inuit traveled throughout Victoria Island, to the west, they concentrated south of Walker Bay, while to the east, they were concentrated south of Denmark Bay.
As the people have no collective name for n themselves, they have adopted the English term, "Copper Inuit". It represents those westernmost Central Inuit who used and relied on native copper gathered along the lower Coppermine River and the Coronation Gulf.
According to Rasmussen (1932), other Inuit referred to Copper Inuit as "Kitlinermiut", as "Kitlineq" was an Inuit language name for Victoria Island.
History.
Early millennia.
Copper Inuit are descendants of Thule culture. Changes in the local environment may have resulted in the transition from prehistoric Thule culture to Copper Inuit culture, a modern people.
For approximately three millennia Copper Inuit were hunter-gatherer nomads. Their settlement and acculturation to some of European-Canadian ways has occurred only during the last 50–60 years, and they have also continued the hunting and gathering lifestyle.
They lived in communal snowhouses during the winter and engaged in breathing-hole ("mauliqtoq") seal hunting. In the summer, they spread out in smaller, family groups for inland caribou hunting and fishing.
The people made copper arrows, spear heads, "ulu" blades, chisels, harpoons, and knives for both personal use and for trade amongst other Inuit. In addition to the copper products, Copper Inuit soapstone products were highly regarded in the Bering Strait trade network. Other trade partners included Inuvialuit from Avvaq and Caribou Inuit to the south. Many Copper Inuit gathered in the Cambridge Bay area in the summertime because of plentiful game.
Post-Euro-Canadian contact.
In 1771, Samuel Hearne was the first European to explore the Coppermine River region. It was here that Hearne's Chipewyan Dene companions massacred a Copper Inuit group at Bloody Falls. Further exploration did not take place until the period of 1820-1853, which included the Sir John Franklin expeditions of 1821 and 1825. John Rae encountered Copper Inuit at Rae River in 1847, and at Cape Flinders and Stromness Bay in 1851. Robert McClure abandoned his ship, "HMS Investigator", at Mercy Bay on Banks Island in 1853 during his search for Franklin's lost expedition. It provided extensive amounts of wood, copper, and iron which the Copper Inuit used for years. Richard Collinson explored the area in 1850-1855.
20th century.
Believing that the Copper Inuit had migrated to Hudson Bay for trading at various outposts, the Canadian government's 1906 map marked Victoria Island as "uninhabited". It was not until the early years of the 20th century that trading ships returned to Copper Inuit territory. They followed Vilhjalmur Stefansson's discovery and report of the so-called Blond Eskimos amongst Copper Inuit from his Arctic exploration trip of 1908-1912. During the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913-1918, Canadian ethnographer Diamond Jenness spent two years living with and documenting the lives of Copper Inuit. He sent thousands of artifacts of their material culture to the Geological Survey of Canada.
Along with trade, European contact brought influenza and typhoid. These newly introduced infectious diseases likely weakened resistance of the natives. Between 1929 and 1931, one in five Copper Inuit died from a tuberculosis epidemic. Around the same time, the whaling industry deteriorated. Alaskan Inupiat and Mackenzie Delta Inuvialuit came into the Coronation Gulf area to co-exist with the Copper Inuit. The first Holman-area (Ulukhaktok) trading post was established in 1923 at Alaervik, on the north shore of Prince Albert Sound, but it closed five years later. The post relocated to Fort Collinson on Walker Bay, north of Minto Inlet. Two other stores opened in Walker Bay but closed by 1939, in the years of the Great Depression.
Settlement.
In 1960, the federal government shipped three housing units to Holman, and another four in 1961. In the years to follow, some families moved to Holman permanently, while others lived there seasonally. Some Copper Inuit moved to the communities of Coppermine (Kugluktuk) or Cambridge Bay. Still others gravitated to outposts along Bathurst Inlet, Contwoyto Lake, Coronation Gulf, and on Victoria Island.
The Copper Inuit have gradually adopted snowmobiles, satellite dish television service, and Christian churches. Many young people now speak English rather than Inuinnaqtun. Together, these introductions have created social change among the Copper Inuit.
Culture.
Language.
Copper Inuit traditionally speak Inuinnaqtun and Western Canadian Inuktitut (also referred to as Inuvialuktun).
Habitat and diet.
Historically, Copper Inuit lived amongst tundra, rocky hills, outcrops, with some forested areas towards the southern and southwestern range. Here they hunted Arctic ground squirrel, Arctic Hare, caribou (barren ground and Peary's herds), grizzly bear, mink, moose, muskox, muskrat, wolf, and wolverine. They fished in the extensive network of ponds, lakes, and rivers, including the Coppermine, Rae, and Richardson Rivers, which sustained large populations of fresh water arctic char (also found in the ocean), grayling, lake trout, and whitefish. The marine waters supported codfish, bearded seal, and ringed seal. Ducks, geese, guillemots, gulls, hawks, longspurs, loons, plovers, ptarmigans, and snow buntings were also part of the Copper Inuit diet. They liked raw but not boiled eggs. They used and cooked food and products from the sea, but kept them separate from those of the land.
Clothing.
Copper Inuit wore short-waisted inner parkas accented with long, narrow back tails, and sleeves that came short of the wrist. In severe weather, they added a heavy outer parka. Women's parkas were distinguished by elongated hoods, and exaggerated, pointed shoulders. Boots extended up the leg to button at the waistline. They made the soles from feathers or bird skins. Copper Inuit used different napkins for different meals: ptarmigan skins when eating caribou, and gull skins when eating seal.
Contemporary clothing and boots may be made of a variety of skins, including:
Religion.
Copper Inuit had an animistic spiritual system, which included belief that animal spirits could be offended through taboo violations. They believed that dwarfs, giants, "caribou people", and the sea-goddess, Arnapkapfaaluk or "big bad woman" inhabit the world. Their conception of the "tupilaq" was similar to the Christian devil.
Shamans ("angatkut") could be male or female. They warded off evil spirits, functioned as intermediaries between people and the spirit world, healed illness or taboo violations, and controlled weather.
Subgroups.
Copper Inuit lived within geographically defined subgroups well documented by Stefansson, Franz Boas, and others:

Observational method (geotechnics)

In geotechnical engineering, during the construction of earth structures (dams and tunnels, for example) the observational method is a continuous, managed and integrated process of design, construction control, monitoring and review enabling appropriate, previously-defined modifications to be incorporated during (or after) construction. All these aspects must be demonstrably robust. The objective is to achieve greater overall economy, without compromising safety.
Overview.
The observational method was proposed by Karl Terzaghi and discussed in a paper by Ralph B. Peck (1969) in an effort to reduce the costs during construction incurred by designing earth structures based on the most-unfavorable assumptions (in other words, geological conditions, soil engineering properties and so on). Instead, the design is based on the most-probable conditions rather than the most-unfavorable. Gaps in the available information are filled by observations: geotechnical-instrumentation measurements (for example, inclinometers and piezometers) and geotechnical site investigation (for example, borehole drilling and a CPT). These observations aid in assessing the behavior of the structure during construction, which can then be modified in accordance with the findings. The method may be described as "learn-as-you-go".
The observational method may be described as follows:
The observational method is suitable for construction which has already begun when an unexpected development occurs, or when a failure or accident threatens or has already occurred. The method is not suitable for projects whose design cannot be altered during construction.
The most serious blunder in applying the observational method is failing to select (in advance) an appropriate course of action for all foreseeable deviations (disclosed by observation) from those assumed in the design. The engineer must devise solutions to all problems which could arise under the least-favorable conditions. If he or she cannot solve these hypothetical problems (even if the probability of their occurrence is very low), he or she must revert to a design based on the least-favorable conditions.

George Elliot (1813–1901)

Admiral Sir George Augustus Elliot, KCB (25 September 1813 – 13 December 1901) was a British Royal Navy flag officer and politician.
Naval career.
He was born in Calcutta, the son of Admiral Sir George Elliot. He entered the navy in November 1827, and was made lieutenant on 12 November 1834. Until 1837 he served aboard HMS "Astraea" along with Lord Edward Russell, also later to become a Member of Parliament. On 15 January 1838 he was made captain of the brig "Columbine" at the Cape and South Africa stations, under the direct command of his father, capturing six slavers in the two years he served in this position. In February 1840 he went to China with his father, and on 3 June was given command of HMS "Volage" after the death of its previous captain, returning to England in 1841 with his invalided father on board as a passenger.
From 1843 to 1846 Elliot commanded the frigate HMS "Eurydice", designed by his father, on the North American station, and in December 1849 he was appointed to the frigate HMS "Phaeton". She was removed from active duty in 1853, and in January 1854 Elliot commissioned the HMS "James Watt", one of the first screw battleships, which he commanded in the Baltic campaigns of 1854 and 1855, despite the poor performance of the ship, and the dissatisfaction of Vice-Admiral Charles John Napier. On 24 February 1858 Elliot became rear-admiral, and was then captain of the fleet to Sir Charles Fremantle, commanding the Channel Fleet. 
Between 1859 and 1863 he was a member of the royal commission on national defences and signed a report which concluded that the Royal Navy would be unable to defend the British Isles in the event of an invasion. In 1861 he was considered for the post of controller of the navy, which was given to Robert Spencer Robinson. Between 1863 and 1865 he was superintendent of HMNB Portsmouth. On 12 September 1865 he became vice-admiral, and then was repeatedly on royal commissions on naval issues. In a dissenting report appended to the 1871 committee on designs, Elliot and Alfred Ryder, who believed that the ram was the primary weapon of naval combat, pressed for increased freeboard, the retention of sailing rig, and the concentration of armour. The direct result of this report was the construction of the battleship HMS "Temeraire".
In 1870 Elliot reached the rank of admiral, and in 1874 he was elected Conservative MP for Chatham; but he resigned his seat in 1875, on being appointed Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. On 2 June 1877 he was nominated a KCB, and the following year, on 26 September, he was placed on the retired list. He continued to occupy himself with the study of naval questions after retirement, and published in 1885 "A Treatise on Future Naval Battles and how to Fight them". He was an active member of the Royal United Services Institute
He died in London on 13 December 1901, after a brief illness.
Family.
On 1 August 1842 he married Hersey Susan Sidney Wauchope, daughter of Colonel Wauchope, with whom he had several children. Their daughter Elizabeth Georgina Frances Elliot married George Carnegie, 9th Earl of Northesk.

Southern Illinois chowder

Southern Illinois Chowder is a thick stew or soup, very different from the New England and Manhattan chowders. The term "chowder" is of French-Indian origin. In Edwards County, Illinois, it refers to both the food and to the social gathering at which it is prepared and served. It is believed to have been brought to the area by the earliest settlers, or "backwoodsmen". Traditionally, the "chowder time" season commences when the first tomatoes ripen and closes with the first heavy frost.
Chowder is usually cooked outside in large black kettles or cauldrons, ranging in size from 20 to 70 gallons. Invariably prepared according to secret recipes, the ingredients are added to boiling water according to their cooking time, so that all are cooked and ready at the same time. The main ingredients are beef, chicken, tomatoes, cabbage, lima beans, and green beans. Traditionally, squirrel meat was a common addition. Chowder is usually considered ready when the ingredients have amalgamated into a fairly thick soup, usually taking four or more hours. The kettles must be stirred almost continuously so that the chowder does not "catch" on the base and scorch. This is accomplished using a wooden blade known as a "paddle". Measuring between eighteen to twenty-four inches long and six to eight inches wide, a paddle has had several bored holes through the blade and a handle attached at right angles. One cook will paddle the chowder - causing the bones to rise - and another cook, called "the bone picker," will use tongs to pick out bones as they separate from the meat.
In 1958, the County Commissioners of Edwards County, Illinois, proclaimed their county the "Chowder Capital of the World."

Bhutanatha group of temples, Badami

The Bhutanatha group of temples is a cluster of sandstone shrines dedicated to the deity Bhutanatha, in Badami town of Karnataka state, India. There are two major temples here. Temple No.1, on the east side of the lake, called the Bhutanatha temple has a superstructure that resembles early South Indian style or North Indian style with its open mantapa (hall or Veranda) extending into the lake, while the smaller Temple No.2 on the north-east side of the lake, sometimes called Mallikarjuna group of temples, has a stepped superstructure, commonly found in Kalyani Chalukya constructions. The inner shrine and mantapa (hall) of Temple No.1 were constructed in the late 7th century during the reign of the Badami Chalukyas while the outer "mantapa", facing the Badami tank, was completed during the rule of the Kalyani Chalukyas of the 11th century. Hence the Bhutanatha temples contain architectural forms from different periods. Studies show that these Kalyani Chalukya architects could have belonged to the same early phase workshop that later built the nearby Yellamma temple and the Mallikarjuna temple group.
Temple plan.
In the inner hall of the Bhutanatha temple, a heavy architrave above the columns divides the hall into a central nave and two aisles. The pillars are massive and the bays in the ceiling of the nave is decorated with lotus rosette. Perforated windows bring dim light into the inner mantapa. On either side of the foot of the shrine doorway is an image, that of goddess Ganga on her vehicle, the "makara", on the right, and on the left, that of goddesses Yamuna riding the tortoise. There is no dedicatory block upon the lintel to indicate to which deity the initial dedication was for. The Shiva "linga" in the shrine appears to be a later addition after the original deity in the sanctum was removed.
The temple is unfinished and at the base of the superstructure ("Sikhara") are vestiges of Jain architecture. The image niches on the wall of the shrine and the hall are now empty though some decorative elements like "makharas" (mythical beast) with long tails still remain. To the north of the hall is a small shrine which was originally consecrated for Vishnu. Following later Jain modifications, the temple was eventually taken over by the followers of Lingayatism who built an outer hall and installed a Nandi (vehicle of Shiva), and a Shiva "linga" inside the sanctum.
The Mallikarjuna group exhibits topological features popularised by the Kalyani Chalukya architects, including plain walls, angled eaves over the open "mantapa" (hall) and pyramid shaped superstructures made of closely spaced horizontal tiers.

Eduardo Mac Entyre

Eduardo Mac Entyre (born in 20 February 1929) is an Argentine artist known for his geometric paintings.
Born in Buenos Aires to a Scottish father and Belgian mother, Mac Entyre began pursuing his talent for sketches at the age of twenty. Studying standards like Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein and Rembrandt, he later began exploring impressionist and cubist influences and his work was first displayed in 1954 at Buenos Aires' Comte Art Gallery.
Calling the attention of local arts patron Ignacio Pirovano and Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art Director Rafael Squirru following a 1959 show at the renowned Peuser Art Gallery, Mac Entyre's work soon earned him a following among several of the city's other accomplished abstract artists, resulting in a genre they themselves described as Generative art, a movement later expanded on by world-renown computer artists like Benoît Mandelbrot.
Sketched until relatively recently by hand following a series of random algorithms, Mac Entyre's work is reminiscent of Leonardo Fibonacci's 13th-century nautilus designsthough Mac Entyre's are more complex owing to their randomness, as each work forms a helix alike in no two sketches. 
A prolific and innovative Pop artist, Mac Entyre has also created a body of more traditional Abstract, Cubist and Figurative art. He was honored by the Organization of American States in 1986 for his contribution to Modern art in Latin America and, still active, his work is widely displayed in Argentina and elsewhere.
