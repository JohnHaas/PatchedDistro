Superpriority

In United States bankruptcy law, the term superpriority confers the status of a claim being superior to that of other claims. Ultrapriority (summapriority) claims will take precedence over superpriority claims. Superpriority claims can be either secured or unsecured.
Lenders and other creditors that extend credit or provide financing to a debtor during the course of a chapter 11 case do so with the expectation that their claims will be entitled to elevated priority of payment. Even though such claims are generally entitled to certain priority status as "administrative claims," creditors seeking more elevated priorities must ensure that they comply with the Bankruptcy Code’s requirements for obtaining this status, so that their claims cannot be undermined due to later developments in the bankruptcy. 
Chapter 7 administrative expenses are entitled to priority over Chapter 11 claims granted superpriority status under (b).

Relief of Ladysmith

When the Second Boer War broke out on 11 October 1899, the Boers had a numeric superiority within Southern Africa. They quickly invaded the British territory and laid siege to Ladysmith, Kimberley and Mafeking. Britain meanwhile transported thousands of troops both from the United Kingdom itself and from elsewhere in the Empire and by the time the siege of Ladysmith had been lifted, had a huge numeric superiority.
Geography of the area.
The Colony of Natal was bisected from east to west by the Tugela River which rose in the Drakensberg (to the west) and flowed into the Indian Ocean to the east. The colony was bisected from north to south by the railway line that linked Durban and Johannesburg (completed 1895). The railway line crossed the river at Colenso. Downstream from Colenso the Tugela entered a gorge while upstream from Colenso the hills that overlooked the river continued on the northern bank of the river only – the southern bank was a relatively flat plain many kilometres wide.
Ladysmith lies on the Durban-Johannesburg railway line in a hollow on the Klip River some 20 km north of Colenso (as the crow flies).
The early campaign.
When the Second Boer War broke out the Boer forces had 21,000 men under the command of General Piet Joubert ready to invade the Colony of Natal. Ranged against them, the British had 13,000 men under the command of Lieutenant General Sir George White. 
The Boers crossed the border into the Colony and after battles at Talana Hill, Elandalaagte and the surrender of a large number of British troops at Nicholsons Nek, White set about defending his position at Ladysmith, some 20 km north of the Tugela river. Churchill asserts that the British Government plan, to which he became privy in later life, was for White to fall back to a position south of the Tugela River. 
After the ensuing Battle of Ladysmith on 28 October, the Boers succeeding in entrapping White and some 8,000 British regulars in Ladysmith. The remaining British forces withdrew south of the Tugela and Estcourt, 30 km south of Colenso effectively became the British front and Joubert, in spite of advice to the contrary from Botha failed to push home his advantage and take the port city of Durban.
Crossing the Tugela.
On the day that the encirclement of Ladysmith was completed, reinforcements headed by General Sir Redevers Buller arrived in Cape Town en route to Natal. Buller remained in Cape Town for three weeks before pressing on to Pietermaritzburg. 
On 15 November a raiding party ambushed an armoured train at Frere, 11 km south of Colenso taking 70 prisoners including Winston Churchill. After another raiding party was surprised on 23 November at Willow Grange,
During these operations Joubert fell from his horse and sustained injuries from which he was to die on 28 March 1900 – four weeks after the relief of Ladysmith. He effectively relinquished control of the Boer forces to Louis Botha, but remained nominally in command of the forces until his death.
The Battle of Colenso (15 December 1899).
By the middle of December, British and Empire troops were pouring into the Colony and Buller, now heading an army of 20,000 men moved his headquarters northwards to Frere.
Buller's first attempt at crossing the river was the Battle of Colenso. From the British point of view, the battle was a fiasco. On the western flank the British forces suffered considerable losses when the Irish Brigade were trapped in a loop in the river 3 km upstream from Colenso. In the centre they lost six guns while on the eastern flank, Buller ordered his men to retreat even though the Boers had abandoned Hlangwane hill. Six Victoria Crosses were awarded for gallantry during the battle.
The Battle of Spion Kop (20–24 January 1900).
Reinforcements continued to pour into Natal and with the arrival of sir Charles Warren's division, Buller had 30,000 men under his command.
Some 20  west of Colenso, Spion Kop, a hill that rose 430 m above the plains dominated Trichardt's Drift, one of the Tugela River crossing points. Buller resolved to capture the hill and so ensure an entry to Ladysmith from the west. The main attack was entrusted to Warren and simultaneously a diversionary attack under Major General Edward Woodgate was launched at Potgieter's Drift, 4 km to the east. From their position on the hills, the Boers were able to watch the British force moving upstream on the south bank of the river and built appropriate defences. On 18 January the British built a pontoon bridge across the river and started to cross. On the night of 23 January in heavy mist the British launched an attack on what they thought was Spion Kop, but in turned out to be a smaller mound some 500 m from the main peak. The following day there was bloody fighting as the British tried to force their way to the top of the main peak. By nightfall both sides thought that the other had taken the hill, so they abandoned their positions and it was only once a Boer scout realised the situation that the Boers retook the hill and the British withdrew back across the Tugela.
The Battle of Vaal Krantz (5–7 February 1900).
Vaal Krantz was a ridge of "kopjes" (small hills) a few kilometres east of Spion Kop. Buller tried to force a bridgehead across the Tugela River. After three days of skirmishing, the British general found that his position was so cramped that there was no room to drag his superior artillery up to support the British infantry attacks. Buller called a council of war and "All his generals agreed that there was nothing for it except to try a new attempt elsewhere."
The Battle of the Tugela Heights (14–27 February 1900).
Even though the Tugela Heights are located on the north bank of the Tugela River a few kilometres downstream from Colenso, the battle itself covered the taking of a number of hills on both sides of the Tugela.
In the first phase of the engagement, the British took the hills of Monte Cristo, some five kilometres to the west of Colenso on the South Bank thereby outflanking the Boers on Hlangwane hill. The Boers, under heavy bombardment abandoned Hlangwane and withdrew north of the Tugela. 
On 21 February a pontoon bridge was built which enabled the British to take Railway Hill and Wynnes Hill, but failed to capture Harts Hill and Wynnes Hill. On 25 February the British moved the pontoon bridge downstream to the mouth of the Tugela gorge where they could cross the river unseen and outflank the Boer positions. On 27 February the British took both Pieters Hill and Harts Hill, after which the Boer resistance crumbled.
The Relief of Ladysmith (1 March 1900) and its aftermath.
On 28 February the Boer commanders ordered their troops to withdraw to the Biggarsberg, some 45 km to the north of Ladysmith. There was little organisation in the withdrawal, but the British forces were instructed not go in pursuit. The British forces led by Lord Dundonald with Churchill by his side entered Ladysmith on the afternoon of 1 March 1900.
The Boers meanwhile established a line of defence along the Biggarsberg, but apart from the odd patrol, there was little movement by either side for two months – Buller was regrouping his forces while Botha, who took over as General Commander of the Boer forces after Joubert's death handed control in Natal to Lukas Meyer. The Boer forces in Natal had meanwhile shrunk to between 4500 and 6000. In the second half of May, Buller resumed the offensive and before the end of the month had taken the North Natal towns of Dundee, Glencoe and Newcastle. 
Events in Natal were soon overtaken by events elsewhere in South Africa. On 15 February, before the siege of Ladysmith had been raised, Roberts had raised the siege of Kimberley and on the day that the British broke through the Tugela Heights, General Cronjé surrendered to Lord Roberts with 4000 men at Paardeberg. On 13 March Roberts captured Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange Free State Republic and of 5 July 1900 he took Pretoria, the capital of the South African Republic.
Meanwhile, in Natal, Buller had yet to secure the mountain passes between the colony and the Orange Free State – an objective that he achieved on 11 June 1900, effetively ending the Natal phase of the war.

Zhejiang Provincial College of Medicine

Zhejiang Provincial College of Medicine (Traditional Chinese: 浙江省立醫學院; Simplified Chinese: 浙江省立医学院), was a defunct medical college for higher education in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. It was one of main roots for the current School of Medicine, Zhejiang University (浙江大學醫學院/浙江大学医学院).
Brief history.
The college was founded as Zhejiang Medical School (浙江医学专门学校) in June 1911. July 1913, the Zhejiang Medical School was renamed as the Zhejiang Public School of Medicine (浙江公立医药专门学校). August 1931, it was renamed as Zhejiang Provincial College of Medicine (浙江省立医学院).
1949, after the Chinese Civial War, the college was taken over by the Hangzhou Civic Military Control Committee (杭州市军管会).
During 1952-1953, the Adjustment for University Colleges and Departments (中國高校院系調整 / 中国高校院系调整) started, Zhejiang University was dissociated, and its medical school, merged with the Zhejiang Provincial College of Medicine, formed the Zhejiang Medical College (浙江医学院).
1960, Zhejiang Medical College was promoted to Zhejiang Medical University (浙江医科大学).
1998, the reunification of Zhejiang University was approved, and Zhejiang Medical University became the School of Medicine, Zhejiang University.

Hang (computing)

In computing, a hang or freeze occurs when either a single computer program or the whole system ceases to respond to inputs. In the most commonly encountered scenario, a workstation with a graphical user interface, all windows belonging to the frozen program become static, and though the mouse cursor still moves on the screen, neither typing on the keyboard nor clicking the mouse produces any effect in the program's windows. The mouse cursor may also be stuck in a form indicating that it is waiting for some operation to complete, such as an hourglass or a spinning wait cursor. 
Many modern operating systems provide the user with a means to terminate a hung program without rebooting or logging out. In more severe hangs affecting the whole system, no window belonging to any program will respond to keyboard or mouse input, and often the mouse cursor will freeze in place on the screen. Almost always, the only way to recover from a system freeze is to reboot the machine, usually by power cycling with an on/off or reset button. 
On Windows systems, if clicked on, a hanging program will gain "Not Responding" in parentheses on its top bar.
A hang differs from a crash, in which a program exits abnormally or the operating system shuts down.
Hangs are not limited to client personal computers with a graphical user interface, as in the example above. Servers can hang as well. In those cases, the server ceases to respond to requests. These sorts of hangs are typically addressed by a solution far more complex than an on/off or reset button.
Pre-emptive multitasking operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7, Apple Computer's Mac OS X and Linux, hang less often as the multi-tasking system is not affected by non-terminating loops and further does not require tasks to yield control to the operating system. If a
task does hang, the scheduler may switch to another group of interdependent tasks so that all processes will not hang.
Causes.
Hardware can cause a computer to hang, either because it is intermittent or because it is mismatched with other hardware in the computer (this can occur when one makes an upgrade). Hardware can also become defective over time due to dirt or heat damage.
A hang can also occur due to the fact that the programmer has incorrect termination conditions for a loop, or, in a co-operative multitasking operating system, forgetting to yield to other tasks. Said differently, many software-related hangs are caused by threads waiting for an event to occur which will never occur. This is also known as an infinite loop.
Another cause of hangs is a race condition in communication between processes. One process may send a signal to a second process then stop execution until it receives a response. If the second process is busy the signal will be forced to wait until the process can get to it. However, if the second process was busy sending a signal to the first process then both processes would wait forever for the other to respond to signals and never see the other’s signal (this event is known as a deadlock). If the processes are uninterruptible they will hang and have to be shut down. If at least one of the processes is a critical kernel process the whole system may hang and have to be restarted.
A computer may seem to hang when in fact it is simply processing very slowly. This can be caused by too many programs running at once, not enough memory (RAM), or memory fragmentation, slow hardware access (especially to remote devices), slow system APIs, etc. It can also be caused by hidden programs which were installed surreptitiously, such as spyware.
Solutions.
In many cases programs may appear to be hung, but are making slow progress, and waiting a few minutes will allow the task to complete.
Usually, in systems with a modern operating system, the user is able to terminate the programs running (for instance, with the kill command, or through the "end task" button on the task list in recent versions of Microsoft Windows), and, if they wish, restart it in the hope that the anomalous condition that caused the hang does not recur. Older systems, such as those using MS-DOS or Windows 3.1x, often needed to be completely restarted in the event of a hang.
A watchdog timer can reboot the computer in the event of a hang (this is commonly used in embedded devices).

Lazybones (film)

Lazybones is a 1935 British film directed by Michael Powell. It was made as a Quota quickie.
Plot.
Sir Reginald Ford (Ian Hunter), known as "Lazybones", is an idle baronet. He hasn't a care in the world, although he doesn't have any money either. His brother and sister introduce him to Kitty McCarthy (Claire Luce), an American heiress, in the hope that he'll marry her and so gain access to her fortune which will help out his family.
Kitty's cousin Mike (Bernard Nedell) and brings Kitty the bad news that she's lost her fortune. Mike is hoping to grab the maps for some Arabian oil fields that are being kept in the house. They are being guarded by two detectives and everybody chasing everybody else whilst trying to get the plans makes an amusing sub-plot.
Back in the main story line, Reginald has discovered that he loves Kitty for herself and doesn't care about her not having a fortune. So they get married, despite the warnings from a pessimistic passer-by who they call in as a witness. Neither of them are broke, but it takes a lot to run the old family pile. Kitty has bought a pub and Reginald and Kitty have some fun serving the regulars there.
Back at the family seat Reginald has found a way to make money from all the other idle members of the English aristocracy. He sets up a "Home for the Idle Wealthy" and they come to stay (for a fee) and act as butler, gardener, chauffeur etc. 
Production.
This was made at a time when the studios used to work through the night and the leading actors were both in plays in London. So after their evening performance they would come out to Twickenham to shoot their parts. And the film was about someone who's meant to be idle!

Jennie C. Van Ness

Jennie Carolyn (Sullivan) Van Ness (August 27, 1879 – September 15, 1967) was a leader in the women's suffrage and Prohibition movements in New Jersey. She was one of the first two women to serve in the New Jersey Legislature, elected in 1920 as a Republican.
Early life and career.
Jennie Carolyn Sullivan was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1879, the daughter of John and Caroline Sullivan. She married Frank W. Van Ness, a businessman, and they settled in East Orange, New Jersey, where they raised three daughters.
Van Ness worked as a substitute teacher at East Orange High School and was an active local civic organizer. She also joined the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association (NJWSA), a group founded by Lucy Stone and other New Jersey suffragists in 1867. Van Ness ran the NJWSA's citizenship schools, which sought to educate women throughout the state in government and politics. In April 1920, when the NJWSA was reorganized as the New Jersey League of Women Voters, she was made a regional director and also chaired a board to draw up a state program on legislative issues.
Legislative tenure.
In September 1920, Van Ness was one of two women, along with Margaret B. Laird, designated by the Essex County Republican Party to run on the twelve-person slate for the New Jersey General Assembly. On announcing her candidacy, she was quoted by the "Newark Evening News" as saying, 
Van Ness and Laird won and became the first two women to serve in the state legislature. Also elected on the Essex County slate was Walter G. Alexander, the first African American to serve in the legislature.
During her single term in the Assembly, Van Ness served on the standing committees for Education and for Unfinished Business, and on the joint committees for the Industrial School for Girls, the School for Feeble Minded Children, and the State Library. She supported Republican legislation granting women equal privileges in government employment, as well as equal representation on party committees.
Van Ness was best known for her sponsorship of a prohibition enforcement bill, known as the Van Ness Act. Attorneys with the Anti-Saloon League helped to draw up the legislation, which was intended to reinforce the federal Volstead Act. The Van Ness Act assessed severe penalties on the sale and manufacture of alcoholic beverages and provided for the trial of offenders before a magistrate without jury:
Introduced in early 1921, the act passed the Republican-controlled legislature over the veto of Governor Edward I. Edwards and became law. In the 1921 legislative election, "wet" (anti-Prohibition) candidates strenuously opposed the Van Ness Act as a violation of constitutional and personal liberties. Anti-Prohibition forces also made a special drive to defeat Van Ness in her Essex County race. She was the only Republican candidate on the Essex County slate to fail to be reelected in November 1921.
The Van Ness Act was on the books for less than a year, as the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals ruled it unconstitutional in February 1922.
Later life.
After her defeat Van Ness continued to be active in the New Jersey Women's Republican Club, serving as the club's legislative chair in 1926. In 1927, she looked back on the first wave of suffragists to seek political office:
According to "Past and Promise: Lives of New Jersey Women", "after 1931 no reference to Van Ness appears in the public record." She died on September 15, 1967 in Wilmington, North Carolina.

Jagged Edge (Gary Numan album)

Jagged Edge is a 2-disc album of alternate versions and remixes of songs from the album "Jagged". When Numan started recording the album "Jagged" he was to use Andy Gray as the producer, who previously worked on the 2-disc compilation album "Hybrid". A version of "Jagged" and work on a track called "Does God Bleed?" (which eventually became "Halo") were the only outcomes from these session with Gray, and he eventually had to leave the project. Numan went back to "Pure" producers Sulpher to work on the album, and again there were delays caused by the birth of Numan's second daughter and record label politics. Because of these events, only six tracks were completed. These tracks were used for "Jagged Edge" along with new reworkings remixed and produced by the original album co-producer, Ade Fenton. The album was not offered on General release and available through Nuworld the Official Gary Numan website only, and due to this, Jagged Edge becomes the least selling album to date.

Mike Vasas

Michael Robert Vasas (born February 17, 1982 in Dearborn, Michigan, United States) is an American singer, multi-instrumentalist, composer, and music educator. He is the founder of the musical collective Grammy Hall Records, and a member of the free improvisation group; The Early Minor Quintet.
Early career.
A singer, piano player and guitarist, Vasas attended Edsel Ford High School in Dearborn, MI. His first songwriting and recording was with high school friend and guitarist Matt Mepham. They released an EP and a full length under the band name Pendulum. The duo also scored a theatrical production of Lewis Carroll’s "Alice in Wonderland" in 1999.
After high school, Vasas attended Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo, Michigan studying music. His first solo record, "The Lessons We Have Learned", was released in 2001 and featured mostly folk-oriented pop songs. That year, Vasas also composed music for a college production of Tom Stoppard’s "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" and reunited with Mepham, releasing "451"—a progressive rock record based on Ray Bradbury’s book "Fahrenheit 451". Additionally, Vasas released "July Songs", a collection of electropop instrumentals recorded during a week of mixing of the 451 album.
In 2002, he formed the musical-comedy duo with David Poytinger, releasing a live 2-disc set in May of that year. Mike and Dave attracted fans because of its original music, short films, and strange advertisements, which included then-president James F. Jones being rescued by the duo in the president's office during a staged heart attack.
Vasas remained busy—independently releasing a live rock record and four more solo records up until 2004. Typically diverse in style, the genres of these records included folk-rock ("Bad Luck"), folk ("Collection on Desktops"), rock ("The City") and baroque pop ("Grace Monica").
In 2004, Vasas began work on his Masters degree in music education at Michigan State University. In 2005, he released an ambient instrumental record and two of his songs were featured in a Los Angeles performance piece "Epiphany". It was then he began work with The Beasts of Burden.
Mike Vasas and The Beasts of Burden.
The original 2005 group consisted of Vasas and current MSU students. The band's name was meant to reference songwriter-led acts [http://www.lansinglowdown.com/index.php/article/458] like Elvis Costello and The Attractions, Johnny Cash and The Tennessee Three, and Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. With members graduating, the original group folded quickly after the end of the school year.
In May 2005, Vasas reformed the group with Ryan Malinich (drums), Brian Richard (bass), and Brian Slagle (guitar, keyboards) playing its first gig at the Ann Arbor Art Fair. Keyboardist, harmonica and mandolin player Eric Bredin joined the group soon afterwards. Vasas released the Rescue Team/Makeshift EP in October 2005, and also co-organized a Neil Young Tribute show that benefitted both The Bridge School and a local domestic abuse shelter in Lansing, Michigan. In February 2006, Vasas celebrated his 24th birthday, performing with The Beasts of Burden, and sharing the bill with Chicago's new-wave act, the Detholz! and Detroit's powerpop trio, The Singles.
In July 2006, "Mike Vasas and The Beasts of Burden" was released to positive national acclaim and the band lightly performed in support of the record. Line up changes led to Mepham taking over guitar duties and the current band remains a four-piece.
In March 2008, Vasas and The Beasts performed at The Palace of Auburn Hills with Creedence Clearwater Revisited and have since been focusing on recording a follow up to their 2006 release. On his website, Vasas described the new record as sounding like “rock-oriented pop songs, built with our own brand of goofy misperceptions and sonic shenanigans."
The Early Minor Quintet.
Vasas is also a member of the free improvisation multi-instrumentalist ensemble, The Early Minor Quintet. Named after sessions from Miles Davis’s "In a Silent Way", the group's Myspace page describes them as;
"musique concrète du jazz..." We freely improvise rock, jazz, funk, noise, and "classical" sounds and reconstitute the music through editing and splicing. Some of the record consists of segments of improvisation unedited. No need to tell you which is which.
The group includes Vasas, Nate Bliton, David Menzo, Max Monson, and Dustin Stoner. Although an album's worth of material is supposedly recorded, and the Myspace band page states “Record Coming Soon on Grammy Hall Records, there is some question as to whether the group is active or not. The ensemble has done a few live performances, but little activity has occurred, and the Myspace page shows the last login as April 2007.
Grammy Hall Records.
Vasas formed Grammy Hall Records to be a record music collective rather than a true business venture. It was involved with the original EP of indie-folk group Frontier Ruckus, whom later signed to Quite Scientific Records. According to the Grammy Hall Records website, the label:
“releases music that is best described as 'I don't know, just music' rather than specific genres. When you buy a record with the GRHL number, it has been supported through the artistic process to be what it wants rather than what it should be. For the listener, this translates to a "diversity" in releases unified only by the collective's commitment to quality. We are a listener's label.”
The Found Sound Series.
In 2008, Vasas began releasing records under the Found Sound Series name. The music is unlike most of Vasas's previous releases, having much in common with composers like Iannis Xenakis and Karlheinz Stockhausen, focusing on electroacoustic music manipulation of samples. Additionally, the releases are composed/performed in a modular recording environment called Bidule. The first five records were released on Vasas's website for free, each offering the chance to donate money if the listener so chooses.
Typical of the series, one recording focuses on the manipulation of four source recordings of street musicians in Germany, recorded by ex-Beasts’ guitarist Brian Slagle. The four tracks each only feature a single short corresponding source recording.
Personal.
Vasas lives with his wife, Amanda, in Lansing, Michigan. He is a music teacher in Battle Creek, Michigan where he teaches middle school and kindergarten general music and choir.

Cyberstalking

Cyberstalking is the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual, a group of individuals, or an organization. It may include the making of false accusations or statements of fact (as in defamation), monitoring, making threats, identity theft, damage to data or equipment, the solicitation of minors for sex, or gathering information that may be used to harass. The definition of "harassment" must meet the criterion that a reasonable person, in possession of the same information, would regard it as sufficient to cause another reasonable person distress. Cyberstalking is different from spatial or offline stalking in that it occurs through the use of electronic communications technology such as the internet. However, it sometimes leads to it, or is accompanied by it. Both are criminal offenses. Cyberstalking shares important characteristics with offline stalking; many stalkers – online or off – are motivated by a desire to control their victims.
A cyberstalker may be an online stranger or a person whom the target knows. A cyberstalker may be anonymous and may solicit involvement of other people online who do not even know the target.
Cyberstalking is a criminal offense that comes into play under state anti-stalking laws, slander laws, and harassment laws. A cyberstalking conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or even criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail.
Definitions.
Stalking is a continuous process, consisting of a series of actions, each of which may be entirely legal in itself. Technology ethics professor Lambèr Royakkers writes that:
CyberAngels has written about how to identify cyberstalking:
When identifying cyberstalking "in the field," and particularly when considering whether to report it to any kind of legal authority, the following features or combination of features can be considered to characterize a true stalking situation: malice, premeditation, repetition, distress, obsession, vendetta, no legitimate purpose, personally directed, disregarded warnings to stop, harassment, and threats.
A number of key factors have been identified:
Cyberstalking is a form of cyberbullying.
Motives.
Mental profiling of digital criminals has identified psychological and social factors that motivate stalkers as: envy; pathological obsession (professional or sexual); unemployment or failure with own job or life; intention to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior; the stalker is delusional and believes he/she "knows" the target; the stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify his/her status; belief they can get away with it (anonymity); intimidation for financial advantage or business competition; revenge over perceived or imagined rejection.
Types.
Of women.
Harassment and stalking of women online is common, and can include rape threats, and other threats of violence, as well as the posting of women's personal information. It is blamed for limiting victims' activities online or driving them offline entirely, thereby impeding their participation in online life and undermining their autonomy, dignity, identity, and opportunities.
Of intimate partners.
Cyberstalking of intimate partners is the online harassment of a current or former romantic partner. It is a form of domestic violence, and experts say its purpose is to control the victim in order to encourage social isolation and create dependency. Harassers may send repeated insulting or threatening e-mails to their victims, monitor or disrupt their victims' e-mail use, and use the victim's account to send e-mails to others posing as the victim or to purchase goods or services the victim does not want. They may also use the Internet to research and compile personal information about the victim, to use in order to harass him or her.
Of celebrities and public persons.
Profiling of stalkers shows that almost always they stalk someone they know or, via delusion, think they know, as is the case with stalkers of celebrities or public persons in which the stalkers feel they know the celebrity even though the celebrity does not know them. As part of the risk they take for being in the public eye, celebrities and public figures are often targets of lies or made-up stories in tabloids as well as by stalkers, some even seeming to be fans. In one noted case in 2011, actress Patricia Arquette quit Facebook after alleged cyberstalking. In her last post, Arquette explained that her security guys chewed her out and warned her Facebook friends to never accept friend requests from people they do not actually know. Arquette stressed the importance of differentiating that just because people were on her page or seemed to be friends or fans did not really mean they were safe. "I'm going to say it again because it is important", the actress wrote about persons on her page, "it doesn't mean they are safe". The media issued a statement that Arquette planned to communicate with fans exclusively through her Twitter account in the future.
By anonymous online mobs.
Web 2.0 technologies have enabled online groups of anonymous people to self-organize to target individuals with online defamation, threats of violence and technology-based attacks. These include publishing lies and doctored photographs, threats of rape and other violence, posting sensitive personal information about victims, e-mailing damaging statements about victims to their employers, and manipulating search engines to make damaging material about the victim more prominent. Victims are often women and minorities. They frequently respond by adopting pseudonyms or going offline entirely. A notable example of online mob harassment was the experience of American software developer and blogger Kathy Sierra. In 2007 a group of anonymous individuals attacked Sierra, threatening her with rape and strangulation, publishing her home address and Social Security number, and posting doctored photographs of her. Frightened, Sierra cancelled her speaking engagements and shut down her blog, writing "I will never feel the same. I will never be the same."
Experts attribute the destructive nature of anonymous online mobs to group dynamics, saying that groups with homogeneous views tend to become more extreme as members reinforce each other's beliefs, they fail to see themselves as individuals, so they lose a sense of personal responsibility for their destructive acts, they dehumanize their victims, which makes them more willing to behave destructively, and they become more aggressive when they believe they are supported by authority figures. Internet service providers and website owners are sometimes blamed for not speaking out against this type of harassment.
Corporate cyberstalking.
Corporate cyberstalking is when a company harasses an individual online, or an individual or group of individuals harasses an organization. Motives for corporate cyberstalking are ideological, or include a desire for financial gain or revenge.
Perpetrators.
Profile.
Preliminary work by Leroy McFarlane and Paul Bocij has identified four types of cyberstalkers: the vindictive cyberstalkers noted for the ferocity of their attacks; the composed cyberstalker whose motive is to annoy; the intimate cyberstalker who attempts to form a relationship with the victim but turns on them if rebuffed; and collective cyberstalkers, groups with a motive. According to Antonio Chacón Medina, author of "Una nueva cara de Internet, El acoso" ("A new face of the Internet: stalking"), the general profile of the harasser is cold, with little or no respect for others. The stalker is a predator who can wait patiently until vulnerable victims appear, such as women or children, or may enjoy pursuing a particular person, whether personally familiar to them or unknown. The harasser enjoys and demonstrates their power to pursue and psychologically damage the victim.
Behaviors.
Cyberstalkers find their victims by using search engines, online forums, bulletin and discussion boards, chat rooms, and more recently, through social networking sites, such as MySpace, Facebook, Bebo, Friendster, Twitter, and Indymedia, a media outlet known for self-publishing. They may engage in live chat harassment or flaming or they may send electronic viruses and unsolicited e-mails. Cyberstalkers may research individuals to feed their obsessions and curiosity. Conversely, the acts of cyberstalkers may become more intense, such as repeatedly instant messaging their targets.
More commonly they will post defamatory or derogatory statements about their stalking target on web pages, message boards, and in guest books designed to get a reaction or response from their victim, thereby initiating contact. In some cases, they have been known to create fake blogs in the name of the victim containing defamatory or pornographic content.
When prosecuted, many stalkers have unsuccessfully attempted to justify their behavior based on their use of public forums, as opposed to direct contact. Once they get a reaction from the victim, they will typically attempt to track or follow the victim's internet activity. Classic cyberstalking behavior includes the tracing of the victim's IP address in an attempt to verify their home or place of employment.
Some cyberstalking situations do evolve into physical stalking, and a victim may experience abusive and excessive phone calls, vandalism, threatening or obscene mail, trespassing, and physical assault. Moreover, many physical stalkers will use cyberstalking as another method of harassing their victims.
A 2007 study led by Paige Padgett from the University of Texas Health Science Center found that there was a false degree of safety assumed by women looking for love online.
Cyberstalking legislation.
United States.
The current US Federal Anti-Cyber-Stalking law is found at .
The first U.S. cyberstalking law went into effect in 1999 in California. Other states include prohibition against cyberstalking in their harassment or stalking legislation. In Florida, HB 479 was introduced in 2003 to ban cyberstalking. This was signed into law on October 2003.
While some laws only address online harassment of children, there are laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims. While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws offer help to victims of all ages.
Some states in the U.S. have begun to address the issue of cyberstalking:
Samantha Kelly; rape; suicide; cyberstalked; Michigan.
Amanda Todd; suicide; cyberstalked; Canada.
Alexis Pilkington; suicide; cyberstalked; Long Island, NY.
In thousands of other cases, unlike the Missouri case of Megan Meier, charges either weren't brought for the cyber harassment or were unsuccessful in obtaining convictions. In the case of Samantha Kelly for instance, after her suicide, they dropped all charges against the man who allegedly raped her, saying that their only witness was dead. Still, because Samantha Kelly was underage, fourteen years old, which was quite provable, the man, who admitted having sex with her could have been charged with statutory rape. In another case of milder cyberstalking - of a man - the outcome was very different: Tyler Clementi's fellow student Dharun Ravi had used a webcam to record him kissing another man. Ravi was convicted in of bias intimidation and invasion of privacy and was sentenced to 30 days in jail, more than $11,000 in restitution and three years of probation. The judge ruled that he believes Ravi acted out of "colossal insensitivity, not hatred Tyler Clementi." 
As in all legal instances, much depends on public sympathy towards the victim, the quality of legal representation and other factors that can greatly influence the outcome of the crime – even if it will be considered a crime. In Samantha Kelly's case, she came from a working class family, lived in a mobile home with her other three siblings and didn't seem to have a lawyer, at least none publicly spoke in her behalf, only her mother and her friends spoke up for her.
Cyberstalking has also been addressed in recent U.S. federal law. For example, the Violence Against Women Act, passed in 2000, made cyberstalking a part of the federal interstate stalking statute. Still, there remains a lack of legislation at the federal level to specifically address cyberstalking, leaving the majority of legislative prohibitions against cyberstalking at the state level.
Most stalking laws require that the perpetrator make a credible threat of violence against the victim; others include threats against the victim's immediate family; and still others require the alleged stalker's course of conduct constitute an implied threat. While some conduct involving annoying or menacing behavior might fall short of illegal stalking, such behavior may be a prelude to stalking and violence and should be treated seriously.
Online identity stealth blurs the line on infringement of the rights of would-be victims to identify their perpetrators. There is a debate on how internet use can be traced without infringing on protected civil liberties.
Australia.
In Australia, the Stalking Amendment Act (1999) includes the use of any form of technology to harass a target as forms of "criminal stalking."
United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, the Malicious Communications Act (1998) classified cyberstalking as a criminal offense.
Spain.
In Spain, it is possible to provide information about cyber-crime in an anonymous way to four safety bodies:
It is also possible to provide information to an Non-governmental organization.
Poland.
Stalking, including cyberstalking, was made a criminal offence under the Polish Criminal Code on 6 June 2011.

The sun position in aerial combat is the pilot's ability to position the aircraft relative to the sun in relationship to the position of the enemy aircraft.
The sun position has had different application to different generations of aircraft. During the period when the dogfight dominated air combat, it was used to make visibility and acquisition of own aircraft difficult for the enemy if the sun was "behind" own aircraft. With the introduction of infrared homing air-to-air missiles, the use of the sun by the pilot was used to confuse the missile guidance system.
The advantages of the sun position were realised early in the history of aerial warfare and is included in the first rule of the "Dicta Boelcke".

Gustav Maass

Gustav Friedrich Hermann Maass (December 2, 1830 – April 28, 1901) was a German botanist who was a native of Brandenburg an der Havel.
In 1848 he became an assistant to agriculturalist Hermann von Nathusius (1809–1879), and from late 1849 spent twelve-plus years in the military as an artilleryman in the 3rd Brandenburg Artillery Brigade, a "Brigadeschule" instructor at Magdeburg and as an assistant to the brigade staff in Berlin. In 1862 he became a manager in the "Magdeburgischen Land-Feuer-Societät" in Altenhausen, a position he maintained until his death in 1901.
In 1866 Maass was co-founder of the Walbeck "Aller Association", and was its chairman from 1874 to 1896. Within this association he performed extensive studies of flora in areas surrounding the Ohre and Aller Rivers. With Paul Ascherson (1834–1913) and Ludwig Schneider (1809–1889), he took part in extended botanical excursions. Results from these field studies were incorporated into Schneider's book "Flora von Magdeburg".
Maass is credited with discovering several new species of blackberry, and provided assistance to Wilhelm Olbers Focke (1834–1922) with the latter's 1877 treatise "Synopsis Ruborum Germaniae". Also, the botanical species "Rubus maassii" is named in Maass' honor.
Increasingly, from the mid-1880s, he combined his botanical trips with historical research, in particular investigations of megaliths and other prehistoric monuments, as well as studies of ancient villages and forts.

Failure

Failure is the state or condition of not meeting a desirable or intended objective, and may be viewed as the opposite of success. Product failure ranges from failure to sell the product to fracture of the product, in the worst cases leading to personal injury, the province of forensic engineering.
In science.
Thomas J. Watson is attributed with saying "If you want to succeed, double your failure rate". "Wired Magazine" editor Kevin Kelly likewise explains that a great deal can be learned from things going unexpectedly, and that part of science's success comes from keeping blunders "small, manageable, constant, and trackable". He uses the example of engineers and programmers who push systems to their limits, breaking them to learn about them. Kelly also warns against creating a culture (e.g. school system) that punishes failure harshly, because this inhibits a creative process, and risks teaching people not to communicate important failures with others (e.g. Null results).
Criteria.
The criteria for failure are heavily dependent on context of use, and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system. A situation considered to be a failure by one might be considered a success by another, particularly in cases of direct competition or a zero-sum game. Similarly, the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants, such that a situation that one considers to be a failure, another might consider to be a success, a qualified success or a neutral situation.
It may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for failure or success due to ambiguous or ill-defined definition of those criteria. Finding useful and effective criteria, or heuristics, to judge the success or failure of a situation may itself be a significant task.
Types.
Failure can be differentially perceived from the viewpoints of the evaluators. A person who is only interested in the final outcome of an activity would consider it to be an "Outcome Failure" if the core issue has not been resolved or a core need is not met. A failure can also be a "process failure" whereby although the activity is completed successfully, a person may still feel dissatisfied if the underlying process is perceived to be below expected standard or benchmark.
Loser is a derogatory term for a person who is (according to the standards of the observer) generally unsuccessful or undesirable.
Commercial failures.
A commercial failure is a product that does not reach expectations of success.
Most of the items listed below had high expectations, significant financial investments, and/or widespread publicity, but fell far short of success. Due to the subjective nature of "success" and "meeting expectations," there can be disagreement about what constitutes a "major flop."
Internet memes.
"Fail" is the name of a popular Internet meme where users superimpose a caption, often the word "fail" or "epic fail", onto photos or short videos depicting unsuccessful events or people falling short of expectations. In July 2003, a contributor to Urban Dictionary wrote that the term, "fail," could be used as an interjection, "when one disapproves of something," citing the example: "You actually bought that? FAIL." This most likely originated as a shortened form of "You fail" or, more fully, "You fail it," the taunting "game over" message in the 1998 Japanese video game "Blazing Star", notorious for its fractured English. There is an entire Internet site dedicated to "fails" called Fail Blog. The #fail hash tag is used on the microblogging site Twitter to indicate contempt or displeasure, and the image that accompanies the message that the site is overloaded is referred to as the "fail whale".
Failboat or consignment of fail is a popular macro series, featuring images of cargo vessels tipping over or shedding cargo, with captions such as 'the failboat has arrived', or 'all aboard the failboat'. The original vessel whose image was used was the MV Cougar Ace, although the Ital Florida, the MV Napoli and even the SS Normandy, sunk at her berth in New York harbour, have appeared.
The term "miserable failure" has also been popularized as a result of a widely known "Google bombing," which caused Google searches for the term to turn up the White House biography of George W. Bush.

King Nga'ara

Nga‘ara (reigned from the death of his father, Kai Mako‘i ca. 1835 to his own death just before 1860) was the last great "‘ariki," or paramount chief, of Easter Island, and the last master of rongorongo, the Easter Island script.
Before becoming king, Nga‘ara ran a "hare rongorongo" (rongorongo school) at ‘Anakena Bay. Generally fathers would teach their sons and any other boys who were interested, and Nga‘ara was the most famous teacher on the island. Boys would study three to five months to learn rongorongo. 
At the time he became ‘ariki, the real power on the island lay in the Birdman priests of ‘Orongo. One of the sacred responsibilities of the "tuhunga tā" (scribes and reciters of rongorongo) seems to have been the recitation or chanting of rongorongo tablets at ‘Orongo during the annual Birdman ceremonies. That quarter of the village was off limits to everyone else during the ceremonies. Nga‘ara sent students, but did not himself attend. 
Rongorongo was considered to contain "mana" (sacred power). For example, chanting a "timo" (vengeance) tablet could release supernatural powers to kill a murderer. A woman would carry a "pure" (fertility) tablet while the scribes chanted it to increase her fertility. Tablets were used to increase crops or a catch of fish. Katherine Routledge was told that one of Nga‘ara's tablets, called "Kouhau ‘o te Ranga" and thought to be Rongorongo text C, was one of a kind and had the power to "give conquest in war" and enslave the conquered. 
In order to take control of the island from the Birdman priests of ‘Orongo, Nga‘ara established an annual rongorongo festival at ‘Anakena. Rather than using the tablets for specific ends, it was a festival for the tablets themselves, and it became the most important assembly in pre-missionary times: 
Hundreds attended these festivals. "Heuheu" staves were brought by all and stuck in the ground where the attendee stood. The tablets were recited from dawn to dusk, with a break for dinner. Nga‘ara presented the reciters with "veri" tapa cloths. Since the "mana" of the tablets went through him at this festival, Nga‘ara was able to assert spiritual primacy over the island. 
When Nga‘ara died, his son Kai Mako‘i ‘Iti (Kai Mako‘i Jr) took over the festival at ‘Anakena for three years, until he was captured in the great Peruvian slaving raid of 1862. Although the slaves were freed the next year, Kai Mako‘i did not survive to return.

<doc id="19005858" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19005858" title="M-80 (explosive)">
M-80 (explosive)

M-80s are a class of large firecrackers, sometimes called salutes. The Simulator, Artillery, M80, was originally made in the early 20th century by the U.S. military to simulate explosives or artillery fire; Later, M-80s were manufactured as fireworks. Traditionally, M-80s were made from a small cardboard tube, often red, approximately long and inside diameter, with a fuse or wick coming out of the side; this type fuse is commonly known as cannon fuse or Visco fuse, after a company responsible for standardizing the product. The tubes often hold approximately 2½–3 grams of pyrotechnic flash powder; one source states that an M-80 has at least 3 grams of powder. Some contain up to 5 grams or more.
Legality.
Canada.
M-80s are not authorized under the law, thus making importation, possession, transportation, storage or manufacturing illegal in Canada.
Germany.
In Germany there is a military hand grenade simulator called "DM22" containing about 5g of flash powder. It is the successor to the "DM12" which contained ~16g flash powder but was considered too dangerous years ago (bangers available for the general public in Germany are not allowed to contain flash powder, only black powder). For comparison, the Quarter stick contains ~35 grams of powder.
United States.
Due to property damages and bodily harm caused by M-80s, Class C fireworks—now known as Consumer Fireworks (class 1.4G), as opposed to Display Fireworks (which were Class B, and are now 1.3G)— civilians are no longer allowed to carry a pyrotechnic device containing more than 50 milligrams of pyrotechnic flash powder. In 1966, M-80s and cherry bombs were banned by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Child Protection Act of 1966. Furthermore, they were then made illegal by the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) in the 1970s. In 1975, U.S. federal regulations were passed to limit all consumer-grade fireworks in the United States to a maximum of 50 milligrams flash powder, down from a previous maximum of 200 milligrams (though firecrackers mounted onto a rocket stick, or other aerial firework devices, such as Rockets, Roman Candles, and Cakes, may have up to 130 mg).
M-80s can still be legally manufactured in the United States by those holding a federal explosives license. Federal and state officials sometimes distribute them to farmers to scare away wildlife encroaching on their crops.
While there are currently many firecrackers sold legally in the United States today to consumers under names such as "M-80 Firecracker", "M-8000", or "M-"##"" (where "##" is a number), none of these contain more than 50 mg of flash powder, and the name is just a lure to make consumers think they are more powerful than they are. These firecrackers most commonly have a small capsule with up to 50 mg of powder and a fuse in it. Surrounding the capsule is plaster or a similar material, and finally a red tube and two plastic endcaps. Because of the size of these firecrackers, buyers are occasionally deceived into thinking that the entire tube is full. Also the fuse, at times, protrudes from the ends of these firecrackers, as opposed to the middle of the tube in real M-80s. Genuine M-80s have paper endcaps, and contain 50–60 times more powder. (Contrary to urban legend, an M-80 that contains 3,000 mg of powder is not equivalent to a quarter-stick of dynamite. Dynamite generally contains a stable nitroglycerin based high explosive, whereas M-80s or any other kind of firecracker contains a low explosive powder, like flash powder or black powder.) Some illicits, however, contain(ed), or were reported to contain, small amounts of picric acid (similar to TNT), for greater effect.
M-80s containing the full original explosive charge continue to be manufactured, bought, and used illegally in the United States. However, in many other countries where regulations are less stringent, large firecrackers such as the M-80 and its equivalents continue to be legally produced, sold, and used. Note that despite their destructive potential, the M-80 being classified as an explosive is debatable. They produce varying strengths of shock waves. As a result, several governments have classified such large salutes as explosive devices.
Accidents.
Numerous injuries accompanied M-80 use during the 1950s and 1960s, and still occur, as M-80s are still produced and sold. Despite instructions to only ignite the product on the ground (many M-80s even have the words "do not hold in hand" written on the tube), many users attempt to light an M-80 while holding it, intending to throw it before it explodes. Others attempt to relight a device that went out. Due to their illicit nature, M-80s may also contain unstable compositions, such as picric acid, nitroglycerin or chlorate/sulfur mixtures, which adds to the possibility of injury. There have been documented cases of users losing their fingers or hands. Peter Criss, the drummer for the rock band Kiss, was a victim of an M-80 during a 1976 Richmond Coliseum concert when a fan threw an M-80 onto the stage, nearly knocking him off his drum riser and leaving him with partial hearing loss for the remainder of the night.

Feral child

A feral child (also, colloquially, wild child) is a human child who has lived isolated from human contact from a very young age, and has no (or little) experience of human care, loving or social behavior, and crucially, of human language. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child abandonment was due to the parents’ rejection of a child’s severe intellectual or physical impairment. Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away. Feral children are sometimes the subjects of folklore and legends, typically portrayed as having been brought up by animals.
Legends.
Myths, legends, and fictional stories have depicted feral children reared by wild animals such as wolves, apes, and bears. Famous examples include Ibn Tufail’s Hayy, Ibn al-Nafis’ Kamil, Rudyard Kipling’s Mowgli, Edgar Rice Burroughs’s Tarzan, and the legends of Atalanta, Enkidu and Romulus and Remus.
Legendary and fictional feral children are often depicted as growing up with relatively normal human intelligence and skills and an innate sense of culture or civilization, coupled with a healthy dose of survival instincts; their integration into human society is made to seem relatively easy. One notable exception is Mowgli, for whom living with humans proved to be extremely difficult.
The mythical children are often depicted as having superior strength, intelligence and morals compared to “normal” humans, the implication being that because of their upbringing they represent humanity in a pure and uncorrupted state: similar to the noble savage.
The subject is treated with a certain amount of realism in François Truffaut’s 1970 film "L’Enfant Sauvage" (UK: "The Wild Boy", US: "The Wild Child"), where a scientist’s efforts in trying to rehabilitate a feral boy meet with great difficulty.
Reality.
Feral children lack the basic social skills that are normally learned in the process of enculturation. For example, they may be unable to learn to use a toilet, have trouble learning to walk upright after walking on fours all their life, and display a complete lack of interest in the human activity around them. They often seem mentally impaired and have almost insurmountable trouble learning a human language. The impaired ability to learn a formal language after having been isolated for so many years is often attributed to the existence of a critical period for language learning, and taken as evidence in favor of the critical period hypothesis.
There is little scientific knowledge about feral children. One of the best-known examples, the “detailed diaries” of Reverend Singh, who claimed to have discovered Amala and Kamala (two girls who had been “brought up from birth by wolves”) in a forest in India, has been proven a fraud to obtain funds for his orphanage. Child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim states that Amala and Kamala were born mentally and physically disabled.
Ancient reports.
The historian Herodotus wrote that Egyptian pharaoh Psammetichus I (Psamtik) sought to discover the origin of language by conducting an experiment with two children. Allegedly, he gave two newborn babies to a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. The hypothesis was that the first word would be uttered in the root language of all people. When one of the children cried “"becos"” (a sound quite similar to the bleating of sheep) with outstretched arms the shepherd concluded that the word was Phrygian because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for bread. Thus, they concluded that the Phrygians were an older people than the Egyptians.
Roman legend has it that Romulus and Remus, twin sons of Rhea Silvia and Mars, were raised by wolves. Rhea Silvia was a priestess, and when it was found that she had been pregnant and had children, King Amulius, who had usurped her father’s throne, ordered her to be buried alive and for the children to be killed. The servant who was given the order set them in a basket on the Tiber river instead, and the children were taken by Tiberinus, the river god, to the shore where a she-wolf found them and raised them until they were discovered as toddlers by a shepherd named Faustulus. He and his wife Acca Larentia, who had always wanted a child but never had one, raised the twins, who would later feature prominently in the events leading up to the founding of Rome (named after Romulus, who eventually killed Remus in a fight over whether the city should be founded on the Palatine Hill or the Aventine Hill).
Controversy and criticism.
Following the 2008 disclosure by Belgian newspaper "Le Soir" that the bestselling book "" and movie "Survivre avec les loups" (“"Surviving with Wolves”") was a media hoax, the French media debated the credulity with which numerous cases of feral children have been blindly accepted. Although there are numerous books on these children, almost none of them have been based on archives; the authors instead have used dubious second- or third-hand printed information. According to the French surgeon Serge Aroles, who wrote a general study of feral children based on archives ("L’Enigme des Enfants-loups" or "The Enigma of Wolf-children", 2007), many alleged cases are totally fictitious stories.

Archibald Seton

Archibald Seton (1758- 30 March 1818) was a Scottish East India Company colonial administrator, Resident and Civil servant.
Bengal Service.
Seton was the son of Hugh Smith who, on marrying Elizabeth Seton of Touch in 1745, had taken his wife's surname and by doing so inherited her estate. In 1780 Seton went to work for the East India Company's administration in Bengal, India.
After passing through the routine of early service in India with much credit to himself, Mr. Seton was successively entrusted with the charge of the collection of the Revenue, and the administration of Civil and Criminal Justice, in the Districts of Bhangolpore and Behar. He was then promoted to a seat in the Provincial Court of Justice in the Province of Behar ; and on the occasion of the cession of a portion of the dominions of the Nabob Vizier to the East India Company, in 1801, be was removed to the same station in the ceded provinces, and was one of the Gentlemen selected by Marquis Wellesley to assist Sir Henry Wellesley in the discharge of the trust of the office of Lieutenant governor of those Provinces.
Seton, Fitzroy And The Seyud of Bareilly, 1804.
During the first few months of Britain's governance at Bareilly in 1804, a magistrate, Fitzroy, in a dispute concerning a garden, struck a Sayud and a cry went up, "A Seyud has been insulted and struck; our houses are about to be demolished..." Archibold Seton, the Governor-General's agent at Bareilly fearing an uprising would overcome the small British occupying force made his way to the Mosque of the popular and respected Moftee Mahomed Ewuz. Seton was first barred entry as he removed his shoes to enter the mosque but was subsequently let go as he said to the guards, "Do you not see, my friends, that I am prepared to approach a sacred place, and meet a holy man."
The Court At Delhi, 1806-1811.
In 1806, Seton was appointed to the office of President at the Court of Shah Alam II, at Delhi, and after Alam's death to that of his successor, Akbar Shah II. During Seton's time in Delhi the East India Company consolidated their rule of parts of the disintegrating Mughal Empire eventually dispensing with the illusion of ruling in the name of the Mughal monarch and removed his name from the Persian texts that appeared on the coins struck by the company in the areas under their control. The East India Company exiled Akbar Shah II's preferred choice of heir, Mirza Jahangir, after he attacked their Seton with a rifle in the Red Fort.
Governor of the Prince of Wales' Island, 1811.
In 9 May 1811, Seton was appointed Governor of Prince of Wales's Island (present day Penang). Seton was barely in the colony when he joined the invasion of Java leaving his eventual successor William Petrie as acting Governor.
Supreme Council, Fort William, Bengal 1812.
From Lieutenant-Governor of the Prince of Wales' Island, he was promoted, in 1812, by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, as the reward of his long services, to a seat in the Supreme Council at Fort William in Bengal, which he filled with much credit for five years, and was on his return to his native country in 1818, at the period of his death.
Death.
Archibald Seton died on 30 March 1818 whilst aboard the East India Company ship "William Pitt" on the passage from St. Helena to England, aged 60.
Epilogue.
During the long period of Mr. Seton's services, he had the happiness to possess in succession, and in the fullest extent, the well-merited confidence of every Government under which he served — that of Marquis Cornwallis, Lord Teignmouth, Marquis Wellesley, Sir George Barlow, and the Earl of Minto : and the friend by whom this faint tribute is paid to his memory, and by whom his virtues will ever, be revered, can assert, from an intimate knowledge for a period of nearly forty years, that his desire to promote the happiness of others was uniformly enthusiastic, and that the virtues of his heart were pure, and unmixed with any tincture of alloy.

It is well remembered by those who saw it on U.S. television in the 1970s and early 1980s (in particular, KTLA developed a tradition of airing it around Halloween each year) because of its surreal sequences. Some sources say it is a version of "Jack and the Beanstalk", perhaps confusing it with the 1974 anime film of that title, which also features both a protagonist named Jack and a witch, but no real similarities to that story are evident.
Plot.
The film opens with a retelling of "Beowulf", narrated over pans of paintings imitative of stained glass, then cuts to Jack, a boy who lives with his animal friends Barnaby Bear, Dinah Dog, Squeeker Mouse and Phineas Fox and drives a car resembling a Ford Model T, even inside the house. One day while out driving Jack sees a girl named Allegra in a flying machine and challenges her to race. After he loses Allegra offers him a ride and he accepts, along with Squeeker Mouse who sneaks aboard. Allegra is actually a witch, and takes Jack to the castle of the evil queen Auriana, who changes children into harpies to be her slaves. Squeeker is sucked into a machine that changes him into a harpy but Jack escapes. When Allegra and another harpy named Harvey Harpy pursue Jack he leads them away from the castle. Harvey Harpy ends up lassoing Jack's animal friends and they get tangled together in the rope. Barnaby Bear starts laughing at the predicament, and soon all are laughing. They take Harvey Harpy back to the house, where they sing and dance together. Spying on them through a window Allegra seems to soften a little as she watches the fun. However, when Jack returns to the house she tries to capture him with a magic rope that has a claw on the end, but the animals drive her away by pelting her with dishes. In some fan copies of the English version about 8 minutes is cut out here, including scenes where Allegra returns to the castle and a battle between Allegra and Jack where she pulls his house off the ground and drops it into a lake. Allegra is injured when she crash lands her flying machine, and Jack takes her back to his house to let her recover. When she comes to she sees Jack, and smiles for a moment, but then flees back to the castle, knocking Jack over as she goes. Jack and friends go back to the castle to rescue Squeeker Mouse, and they encounter Allegra again. She promises to help them since they were so kind to her when she was injured, but instead she leads them into a trap that drops them into a land where the plants try to eat everybody. At the end giant mushrooms drop Jack and friends into a pit with the machine that changes children into harpies. The wind starts to suck Jack into the machine, while the Harpies chant 'Into the Machine!'. Barnaby Bear remembers that a giant windmill powers the machine, so he runs off and stops it. With the windmill immobilized other harpies jump into the pit to take Jack prisoner, but Barnaby Bear finally lets go of the windmill and the harpies are sucked into the machine, which overloads and explodes, with Jack and friends escaping. Queen Auriana punishes Allegra for her failure to capture Jack by exiling her to the ice caves beneath the castle. Harvey Harpy is sad to see Allegra punished, even opposing the queen for her harshness, so when he runs into Jack he explains what happened to Allegra, and leads him to the ice caves to rescue her. Meanwhile, Barnaby Bear, Phineas Fox and Dinah Dog are captured by the queen, who imprisons them in magic bottles and leaves them to watch what happens to Jack in a crystal ball. When Jack rescues Allegra from the ice caves, the queen transports them back to the pit, where she battles them with a golden chain she uses as a whip. When Squeeker Mouse tries to cover up the crystal ball with his cape so no one can see what is happening to Jack he knocks the crystal ball to the ground and it cracks. This breaks the spell imprisoning the animals, and they realize that the crystal is the source of the queen's power. Barnaby Bear throws the crystal ball out the window, and when it shatters the queen loses her powers and is transformed into a large goblin-like creature. Jack and friends pursue the queen, who has a large air-ship ready for her escape. She sets a time bomb to explode after she leaves, but Harvey Harpy ties the bomb to her air-ship as it takes off. As the queen tries to remove the bomb she crashes into the castle and explodes. This destroys the castle and breaks the spell cast by the evil queen, and one by one all the harpies turn back into children, including Allegra and Harvey, who celebrate with Jack.
Availability.
Jack and the Witch is currently available in a region 2 DVD from Tōei Video. The audio is Japanese only, without English subtitles. Fan copies of the English version can sometimes be found on eBay or on fan sites. However, the English version was most recently screened nationwide on the Digital over-the-air THIS TV network on Saturday October 30, 2010.

Waggonfabrik Fuchs

Waggonfabrik Fuchs ('Fuchs Coach Factory') was a German coach and wagon builders based in Heidelberg in the state of Baden-Württemberg in southwestern Germany. They built railway wagons and tramways from 1862 to 1957.
The firm was founded in 1844 by Johann Schäfer in Heidelberg and was sold after his death in 1861 to Heinrich Fuchs, who formed the Waggonfabrik Heinrich Fuchs in 1862. Fuchs moved the factory from the district of Weststadt in Heidelberg to the neighbouring district of Rohrbach (completed in 1902).
In addition to railway wagons, in its early days the firm also built bridges and other facilities for the railways. Major customers for its wagons and coaches in the early years were the Baden State Railways.
From about 1901 the production of tramways began. Customers included the "Elektrische Straßenbahn Heidelberg–Wiesloch", "Heidelberger Straßen- und Bergbahn AG" ("HSB"), "Oberrheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft" ("OEG"), "Rhein-Haardtbahn" ("RHB"). Even U-Bahn trains were supplied for the Berlin U-Bahn and the glass train ("Gläserne Zug").
Fuchs survived the two world, but only with heavy losses. Production had to be stopped or almost all its employees had to be made redundant on several occasions. Attempts were made to diversify to other products such as tractors or diggers, but with little success.
The company was taken over in 1930 by the "Vereinigung Westdeutscher Waggonfabriken" ("Westwaggon") and the majority of shares sold in 1940 to the "Dillinger Hütte" that, due to its location in the Saargebiet, sold its share of Fuchs in 1957 to the International Harvester Company, who switched its production to combine harvesters.
In memory of Heinrich Fuchs, a street in the Heidelberg district of Rohrbach is named Heinrich-Fuchs-Straße.
Today the site of the former Waggonfabrik Fuchs factory is a modern housing estate "Quartier am Turm" ('tower district') and one of the largest property developments in the city. The architecture of the new district preserved the historical identity of the coach and wagon factory by making use of the existing characteristic structures.

Native American use of fire

In addition to simple cooking, Pre-Columbian Native Americans used fire in many and significant ways, ranging from protecting an area from fire to landscape-altering clearing of prairie.
Human-shaped landscape.
Many people believe that North America, before the coming of the Spanish explorers, missionaries, and settlers, was a totally pristine, natural, wilderness world with ancient forests covering the landscapes. This ideal world was populated by millions of Indian people who, somewhat amazingly, “were transparent in the landscape, living as natural elements of the ecosphere. Their world, the New World of Columbus, was a world of barely perceptible human disturbance.” This peaceful, mythic, magical ideal — sometimes referred to as tabula rasa — has symbolized the thinking behind much of the modern environmental movement. However these impressions of a "benign people treading lightly on the land" is wrong in its view of an entirely natural landscape: natives played a large role in maintaining the diversity of their ecosystems.
Fire scientists and ecologists often find old fire scars in trees going back hundreds of years. Geographers studying lake sediments often find evidence of charcoal layers going back thousands of years, attributing the data to prehistoric fires caused by climatic warming and drying conditions. Since the trees and sediments cannot document how the fires started, lightning becomes the easiest “natural” explanation. Early researchers thought that no large burning was carried out by natives, but research during the latter half of the 20th century has shown that many or most of the presettlement fires were intentionally caused.
Keeping large areas of forest and mountains free of undergrowth and small trees was just one of many reasons for using fire in ecosystems. Intentional burning has greatly modified landscapes across the continent in many subtle ways that have often been interpreted as natural by the early explorers, trappers, and settlers. Many research scientists who study presettlement forest and savanna fire evidence tend to attribute most prehistoric fires as being caused by lightning (natural) rather than by humans. This problem arises because there was no systematic record keeping of these fire events. Thus the interaction of people and ecosystems is down played or ignored, which often leads to the conclusion that people are a problem in "natural" ecosystems rather than the primary force in their development.
Romantic and primitivist writers such as William Henry Hudson, Longfellow, Francis Parkman, and Thoreau were major inventors of the The Pristine Myth, which became part of American heritage. Influenced by Western prejudice against primitivism and hunter-gatherer societies, many people still believe that Native Americans lived in complete harmony with the environment and neither disturbed nor destroyed but took only what was absolutely needed for survival. One of the powerful technologies which Native Americans had was fire, and they clearly changed the landscape with it. Sometimes to clear the woods, sometimes to create a berry patch, the changes spread across the continents.
Role of fire by natives.
Although there are no written documents describing the intentional, controlled burning of forests, it is believed by some that the cumulative impact of burning by Native Americans profoundly altered the landscape. When first encountered by Europeans, many ecosystems were the result of repeated fires every one to three years, resulting in the replacement of forests with grassland or savanna, or opening up the forest by removing undergrowth. More forest exists today in some parts of North America than when the Europeans first arrived. In South America, the cerrado of South America have been coexisting with fire since ancient times; initially as natural fires caused by lightning or volcanic activity, and later caused by man. Terra preta soils, created by slow burning, are found mainly in Amazonia, where estimates of the area covered range from 0.1 to 0.3%, or 6,300 to 18,900 km² of low forested Amazonia to 1.0% or more (twice the surface of Great-Britain).
There is some argument about the effect of human-caused burning when compared to lightning in western North America. There is agreement that natives played a significant role across the eastern part of that continent. As Emily Russell (1983) has
pointed out, “There is no strong evidence that Indians purposely burned large areas...The presence of Indians did, however, undoubt- edly increase the frequency of fires above the low numbers caused by lightning.” As might be expected, Indian fire use had its greatest impact “in local areas near Indian
habitations.”
Generally, the American Indians burned parts of the ecosystems in which they lived to promote a diversity of habitats, especially increasing the "edge effect," which gave the Indians greater security and stability to their lives. 
Most primary or secondary accounts relate to the purposeful burning to establish or keep "mosaics, resource diversity, environmental stability, predictability, and the maintenance of ecotones." These purposeful fires by almost every Native American tribe differ from natural fires by the seasonality of burning, frequency of burning certain areas, and the intensity of the fire. Indians tended to burn differently depending on the resources being managed. Hardly ever did the various tribes purposely burn when the forests were most vulnerable to catastrophic wildfire. Indeed, for some Indians, saving the forest from fire was crucial for survival. Those Indian tribes that used fire in moist ecosystems tended to burn in the late spring just before new growth appears, while in areas that are drier fires tended to be set during the late summer or early fall since the main growth of plants and grasses occurs in the winter. For the most part, tribes set fires that did not destroy entire forests or ecosystems, were relatively easy to control, and stimulated new plant growth. Indians burned selected areas yearly, every other year, or intervals as long as five years.
Arrival of the Europeans.
Fires indicated the presence of humans to many European explorers and settlers. In San Pedro Bay in 1542, chaparral fires provided that signal to Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, and later to others across all of what would be named California.
By the 17th century, as most European explorers, fur traders, and settlers began to arrive in North America, native populations were on the verge of collapse because of new diseases (such as smallpox) and widespread epidemics (influenza) against which the Indians had no immunity. In addition, warfare (with old enemies and new immigrants), new technologies (horse, iron, and firearms), change of economy (to fur trading and sheep grazing), different food sources (European-style farming and imperial handouts), and treaties (restricting or removing Indians from traditional lands) all had significant consequences— mainly negative—on native cultures and populations.
By the 19th century, many native languages and tribes were becoming extinct and knowledge of the old ways was dying. Only a handful of ethnographers and anthropologists (many employed by the Smithsonian Institution and/or the American Bureau of Ethnology) felt the need to record the Indian languages and lifestyles before the last of many tribes disappeared. Even fewer of these researchers asked questions about the native peoples deliberately changing ecosystems.
Settlers and the Rich Prairies.
Early explorers and fur trappers often observed huge burned-over or prairie/barren areas with many dead trees "littering" the landscape, without knowledge of whether the fires were natural or caused by Indians. Written accounts by early settlers remain incomplete, although many noted that there was evidence of burned or scorched trees and open prairies or savannas with tall grasses in every river basin. There are many other accounts of travelers in forest areas commenting on the ability to see long distances through the forest, which was lacking in shrubs, brush, and small trees. The abundance of open prairie areas, which could be millions of acres large, was often incorrectly thought to be the result of poor soils that would not support trees or even crops.
However, a number of settlers/farmers saw that the prairies were potentially rich land (besides that fact that it was "ready for the plow" without having to clear the land). This grass-covered prairie land was one of the primary reasons for settlers to head west to the Oregon Territory and California, and later to homestead the Great Plains. In the late 19th century until today, the Great Plains of the U.S. and Canadian Prairies were to become the farming “breadbasket” for the two nations.
Through the turn of the 20th century, settlers often used fire to clear the land of brush and trees in order to make new farm land for crops and new pastures for grazing animals – the North American variation of slash and burn technology – while others deliberately burned to reduce the threat of major fires – the so‑called "light burning" technique. Since the uplands were still in government ownership (public domain), many settlers adjacent to the hills often either deliberately set fires and/or allowed fires to "run free." Also, sheep and cattle owners, as well as shepherds and cowboys, often set the alpine meadows and prairies on fire at the end of the grazing season to burn the dried grasses, reduce brush, and kill young trees, as well as encourage the growth of new grasses for the following summer and fall grazing season.
Reasons for burning.
Henry T. Lewis, who has authored more books and articles on this subject than anyone else, concluded that there were at least 70 different reasons for the Indians firing the vegetation. Other writers have listed fewer number of reasons, using different categories. In summary, there are eleven major reasons for American Indian ecosystem burning:

Hot! Live and Otherwise is a combination live and in-studio album by American singer Dionne Warwick, released in 1981 on Arista Records. The LP was originally issued as number A2L 8605 in the Arista Catalog.
An extended version of this album is available having been issued on CD in 2007.
History.
The live portion of the albums was recorded over several dates at Harrah's Casino in Reno, NV in the spring of 1981. The original 2-LP release featured three sides of live recordings, plus a fourth side of studio recordings, including the pop and AC hit "Some Changes Are For Good". Three of those studio recordings were produced by Michael Masser and the other two were produced by Steve Buckingham.
The album was reissued on CD in 2007 with new liner notes from David Nathan, a slightly amended track listing (missing the live track "We Never Said Goodbye" and one of the studio tracks "Dedicate This Heart"), and added two previously unissued studio bonus cuts, "When The Good Times Come Again" and "Right Back." The former song was written by Richard Kerr (songwriter) and Will Jennings – the same writing team that provided Warwick with her gold-selling comeback hit, "I'll Never Love This Way Again" in 1979.

Pendent party jurisdiction

In the United States federal courts, pendent party jurisdiction refers to a court's power to adjudicate a claim against a party who would otherwise not be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts, because the claim arose from a common nucleus of operative fact.
One well-known example of this is when a federal court adjudicates a state law claim asserted against a third party which is part of a case brought to it under its federal question jurisdiction. This was the situation in "Finley v. United States", , in which the Supreme Court found that a grant of jurisdiction over a claim involving certain parties did not extend to additional claims involving different parties. "Finley" was superseded by "Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services", 545 U.S. 546, in which the Supreme Court noted that Congress overturned the result in "Finley" by enacting 28 U.S.C. § 1367. 
Pendent party jurisdiction is a form of supplemental jurisdiction covered by . Subsection (b) prohibits parties from being joined in a federal case brought under the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts (where diversity is the sole basis of federal court jurisdiction), if joining such parties would eliminate complete diversity.

__NOTOC__
The Edifício Copan ("Copan Building") is a 140-metre, 38-story residential building in São Paulo, Brazil. Construction began in 1957 and, following some interruptions, was completed in 1966. It is one of the largest buildings in Brazil and has the largest floor area of any residential building in the world. 
The building was not named after the ancient Mayan city in Honduras; the name is an acronym for its original developer, Companhia Pan-Americana de Hotéis e Turismo (Panamerican Company for Hotels and Tourism). The building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer`s office in São Paulo, he himself being responsible for the famous sinuous facade design. In its final version, the building had 1,160 apartments and 5,000 residents. Due to the large number of residents, the São Paulo City Hall gave the building its own postal code (CEP: 01046-925). The current condominium has over 100 employees to serve residents and to conduct maintenance. The ground floor is home to 70 businesses and establishments including (since the 1990s) a church, a travel agency, a bookstore, and 4 restaurants. Its site has 10572.80 square meters.
The Copan Building has inspired writers, filmmakers, photographers, and other artists from all over the world. A short story collection entitled "Arca sem Noé - Histórias do Edifício Copan", by Brazilian author Regina Rheda, was published in Portuguese in 1994 and won the 1995 Jabuti prize in Brazil. "Arca sem Noé" is also published in English as "Stories From the Copan Building", within the volume "First World Third Class and Other Tales of the Global Mix" (University of Texas Press).
It is also currently a "ploppable" building in SimCity (2013).

Archdiocese of Santa Severina

The archdiocese of Santa Severina was a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical territory in Calabria, southern Italy, that existed until 1986. In that year it was united into the diocese of Crotone, forming the Archdiocese of Crotone-Santa Severina.
History.
Santa Severina, built on a rocky precipice on the site of the ancient Siberena, became an important fortress of the Byzantines in their struggles with the Saracens. It is not known whether it was an episcopal see from the beginning of the Byzantine domination; When it became an archbishopric, probably in the tenth century, its suffragan sees were the diocese of Orea, the diocese of Acerenza, the diocese of Gallipoli, the diocese of Alessano and the diocese of Castro. 
The Greek Rite disappeared from the diocese under the Normans, but was retained in the cathedral during a great part of the thirteenth century. The earliest known bishop was one Giovanni, but his date is uncertain. From 1096, when the name of Bishop Stefano is recorded, the list of prelates is uninterrupted. Among them were: 
In 1818 the territories of the suppressed diocese of Belcastro and diocese of S. Leone were united to Santa Severina. Belcastro, considered by some authorities to be the ancient Chonia, had bishops from 1122; noted was Jacopo di Giacomelli (1542), present at the Council of Trent. Bishops of S. Leone are known from 1322 till 1571, when the diocese was united to that of Santa Severina. Other suppressions in that year, united to Santa Severina, were the diocese of Cerenzia, diocese of Isola, diocese of Strongoli, Diocese of Umbriatico. Another later holder was Carmelo Pujia from 1905 to 1925.
The archdiocese became reduced to one suffragan see, the diocese of Caritati.

The Five Gold Bands

The Five Gold Bands is an early science fiction novel by Jack Vance, first published in the November 1950 issue of " Startling Stories " magazine. It was published in 1953 as a separate book under the title The Space Pirate, and in 1963 it was paired with Vance's Hugo Award-winning novella "The Dragon Masters" in the form of an Ace Double.
Plot summary.
Picaresque Irish adventurer Paddy Blackthorn is caught attempting to steal an interstellar space drive and is sentenced to death by the ruling council of mutant humans. The mutants' creator bequeathed them the secret of the drive, and with it a monopoly on space travel, which allows them to dominate normal humans. 
During his escape, Paddy discovers that the knowledge of how to manufacture the engines has been stored in five gold rings, one for each mutant race. The rings are hidden in five secret locations for safekeeping. With the help of a beautiful human secret agent, Fay Bursill, Paddy searches the home planets of each of the mutant species, in the hope that Earthfolk will be able to resume their rightful place in space.
Major themes.
Although one of Vance's earliest efforts, "The Five Gold Bands" exhibits many of the stylistic elements that would come to characterize many of his later works: a colorful protagonist who unintentionally achieves the greater good in a frantic and desperate attempt to save his own life (and fortune), numerous exotic locales populated by equally exotic sentient species, and the theme of a treasure hunt. It also introduces another frequent theme of Vance’s work – that the environment of an alien planet will change any human colonists within a few generations to the extent that they will scarcely be recognizable as human.

Tokyo Chiyoda District.
Akira Kongō (Kongō Banchō).
The main character is a large man with an even larger heart. He remains calm and only loses his cool when his friends are hurt. When he speaks most people can't help but feel overwhelmed and see the error of their ways. He saved Hinako from Kiryu Touya and became the banchō of Chiyoda district. He helps the little guy and doesn't care about being powerful or rich. Besides his desire to destroy the District Plan he seems happy just enjoying the simple things. He goes to Raimei Senior High School, and follows what he calls simple logic (someone hurts your friend, you hurt them back). Besides his fighting knowledge and schoolwork Akira isn't very knowledgeable of technology. His strength and massive build makes delicate work hard for him. Besides taking down other banchō, Akira also helps those in his district with their problems.
Hinako and Tsukimi Sakura.
Sisters who are Akira's friends, Hinako is the older of the two she keeps an unusual memo picture collection on her phone to show her sister when she picks her up from kindergarten, she is in the same class as Akira. When Akira first told her about the District Plan she laughed and reported to a cop, said cop was in on the plan and captured her after which Akira beat Kiryu Touya who was holding her. Tsukimi is the kid sister she likes being with Hinako and Akira who she calls "big brother". Akira treats her like a father would his daughter. Akira took down a whole yakuza group just to get one of them to apologize for ripping Tsukimi's drawing.
Oyanana Hikaru.
He is the son of the school's chairman. Because of his father's status Hikaru got away with everything from eating during class to openly undressing girls and still have the entry to the best universities. He gets everyone to do what he wants by promising them recommendations. He tried to get Akira to be his bodyguard and after Akira refused and embarrassed him he tried to get the Takeshi to beat up Akira. After all failed and Akira giving him advice about not depending on others power he has taken a turn for the better.
Ouda Takeshi.
The school's boxing champ and apparently the only member of the boxing club. His left straight punch is said to have 900 kg of power, when Akira took his punch without any defence, Takeshi saw the kind of person Akira was and admitted defeat.
Karaburi Mitsunobu.
He doesn't go to Akira's school, he seems slightly crazy. He wears an umpire's mask and wields a steel bat with spikes hidden in the tip. He was sent to get rid of Akira after Hinako was captured, however when he fought Akira, Mitsunobu said he couldn't use his hands or feet in his Home-run game (pretty much telling Akira to stand still and let him hit the tar out of him). Instead, Akira responded by doing just one knock out head-butt.
Kiryu Touya (Iai Banchō).
The Chiyoda District Banchō normally known as Iai Banchō, he is what some would call a bishōnen and seems very cultured and calm. He is defeated by Akira, and since the battle was taped Akira has taken Touya's place as the district's banchō. He later returned with a group of other banchō (all of whom were defeated by Akira) to assist Akira against the Five Dark Vows—his reason is that all those in the world are just talk, whereas Akira could back up his. When he and the others were enrolled in Akira's class, it is shown that he can't take girls dressing in short skirts (his school required girls to wear hakama) he is also very pure-hearted and follows bushido. This is also his biggest weakness since he can't take scantily clad women, seeing this causes him to have large nosebleeds. Touya fully believes that Akira has what it takes to be the winner of the District Project and is willing to die to help Akira succeed. During his battle against the Five Dark Vows, he cuts across his eyes to prevent being distracted, temporarily blinding himself, but later regains his sight.
Sumida District.
Master Raionji (Nenbutsu Banchō).
The banchō of the Sumida District. He is known as the Nenbutsu (Buddhist Prayer) Banchō. Acting like a Buddha, he brainwashed all the students in Kouji Senior High to be his acolytes in his cult. He also seems greedy and somewhat narcissistic since he had his followers buy and sell lots of merchandise with his image on it, like keychains and t-shirts. He seems to have the power to blast anyone and move while sitting with some kind of psychic force, but it is shown to be a trick when Akira sees Raionji use it underwater. His power is his abnormally large sized diaphragm that he keeps covered with his coat. Akira defeats him, he loses his followers (who believe Akira to be the reincarnation of Acala) and then has to pay for all the merchandise with his face on it. He later returns with a group of banchō (all defeated by Akira) to assist him against the Five Dark Vows—his reason is since Akira took on his 1000 followers to avenge just one friend, he now truly believes in Buddha, and he fully believes that Akira is the reincarnation of Acala. He is now enrolled in Akira's school where he acts like a real priest saying that the joining of the former banchō was an act of Buddha, but there are times when his former greedy self appears trying to sell his merchandise. He is shown to be more cowardly in battles but will fight bravely nonetheless. He gets very annoyed when people call him bald. He victory phase is "The afterlife is always open for business."
Seitaka and Kongara.
Raionji's two underlings Seitaka is a wall-sized man and Kongara is extremely flexible and has a steel hard garb. Both of them fight be Kangara bending himself into a ball and Seitaka throwing him. Both are defeated by just one of Akira's punches. When Raionji is defeated they give him the bill for all his merchandises.
Minato District.
Shirayukinomiya Kobushi.
She is the Gouriki (Herculean Strength) Banchō. She appears to be a sweet young tomboyish looking girl and attends St. Veronica Academy she comes from a very rich family, despite her petit size she can eat an entire Chanko Nabe by herself this is due to her body's Hyperion Constitution (a rare medical condition that makes her muscle a dozen times denser, more flexible and her organs can keep up with it, with the drawback being a super increased metabolism). She fancies herself a warrior of justice and went around destroying areas of her district that she considered evil or that were used be those who are evil (she destroyed an entire street since a biker gang used it frequently which was disrupting the peace). She tried to destroy a chemical plant since it was polluting the air without thinking about the hazardous chemicals she could release onto the surrounding area. Akira stopped her also during their fight, showing her that she was acting without any forethought. When defeated she says she's not fit to be a banchō, but Akira disagreed and called her a splendid banchō since she was willing to risk her life for her underling. She later returns part of the group of banchō that support Akira. 
Gokurou.
The family butler and Kobushi's private cook who supports her completely. He is a very fast cook able to make a Chanko Nabe in seconds and also he is protective of Kobushi as a father would be. He also seems to have extreme combat ability, able to defeat several of Machine Banchou's robot underlings easily, something that interests Akira.
During World War II he was a chosen member of the Yatagarasu project. He was a comrade of Homura Kongou, whom he refused to kill to become the final participant of the project. He and Homura were saved from execution by intervetion of General Shirayuki Nomiya, the grandfather of Shirayukinomiya Kobushi. He subsequently became the Shirayuki family butler in an attempt to repay his debt.
Onji Kairiki.
He is Kobushi's underling and went to request that Akira stop her from destroying more areas in they district. He is twice as big as Akira but lacks the superhuman strength. He admires Kobushi to the point of someone confusing it for love.
Kita District.
Harito Takaradzuka.
He is the Shirobara (White Rose) Banchō. He is a narcissistic bishōnen who wants to fill the world with things he deems beautiful. When he first meet Akira he had his underlings spread white rose petals all over the street while he requested a fair duel with Akira (he was tricked into believing that Akira was gravely wounded so he would have had an advantage). Akira defeated him with one normal punch and told him not to litter the streets. Later back at his base his underlings betrayed him because they were tricked by the Hikyou Bancho, the same man who told him the lie about Akira's wound. He was forced to withdraw when his elderly parents were threatened. He later returned, interrupting the fight Yuu and Akira where he used one of Yuu's little brothers as a shield. There he revealed Yuu's past and tried to get them to kill each other. This backfires with both of them attacking him.
Itabashi District.
Yuu Akiyama.
The Hikyou (Cowardly) Banchō. His catch phase is "let's fight in a fair, cowardly way." Hikyou Banchō will use any means necessary to win; he has no compunction about resorting to lies, sneak attacks, kidnapping, etc. He attacks Akira with a series of traps, but was defeated when he tried to use a wrecking ball on Akira, which Akira managed to send back at him. Akira was ready to deliver the final blow when Yuu's underling Kouta intervened, stopping Akira. Shirobara Banchō appears and uses Kouta as shield, telling Yuu to stab Akira. Yuu does so, then pretends to stab himself trying to save Kouta. In the end, Akira saved both of them since the knife had no effect on him. His reason for helping Akira is so that Akira will be indebted to help him when needed and he plans to backstab Akira when he wins control over all the districts (the real reasons is most likely that Yuu is thankful to Akira, who helped save Yuu's family even if he tried to kill him). He grew up in an orphanage where he has 13 little brothers and sisters (no blood relation) to support the orphanage (after the owners lost they money to gambling debts) he would do any dirty job for money (blackmail, fraud, stealing, etc.) He wears a burglar mask and cap when he fights so others don't know what he looks like, so they don't set traps for him and also so his family won't be put in danger, he states "if it's for the sake of my precious brothers and sisters I'll be as cowardly as it takes".
Kouta.
Yuu's little brother, he tried to attack Aikra to save his big brother. He is one of 13 little brothers and sisters (not by blood) he knows of Yuu's misdeeds but is still proud of him for what he does to protect and provide for his family.

The first generation leader, who took her in as a mentor, was Kongou Takeshi's (Akira'a Brother) wife and mother to Kongou Rai (Takeshi's son and Akira's nephew). Ever since her death, Sasori Banchou has taken in Rai as some sort of adoptive son for her and has sworn to get revenge on Kongou Takeshi. Due to the similarity between Akira and Takeshi, she mistakes the former for the latter and mercilessly goes after him. The way she puts it, a woman's grudge is worse than the depths of hell and her lethal fighting style and strength seem to support that a big deal. During her fight with Akira she was shown that she was attacking the wrong guy and now she and Akira agreed to share information in order to find Takeshi. Her ponytail curves upward and has a tip making it look like a scorpion's tail. She returns to help fight against Gaugau Banchou. She appears to have a crush on Yuu Akayama, whom she doesn't know is Hikyou Banchou.
Kongou Rai.
Takeshi's son who looks like a mini version of him. He is friends with Tsukimi and acts like Akira. He uses Takeshi's phase "Don't sweat the small stuff". Rai can also use the Double Hammer but his is far weaker than Akira's since he is still a kindergartener.

Bunkyou District.
AT-KM-100.
The Machine Banchou. He was created as an intelligent weapon to singlehandedly stop armed conflicts and military crisises.

Nakano District.
Dokusen Banchou.
The Dokusen (Monopoly) Banchou.

Yoruko and Asako.
The both of them are the Doukke (Clown) Bancho. The two sisters were raised as heirs to the best magician known to the world. Before they could talk they were trained to perform magic tricks and at the age of 3 they had already mastered more than one hundred. Doukke Banchou's greatest skill is diversion. They are such a great trickster that few people even notice they are dealing with two people in the disguise of one. Doukke Banchou also is skilled in the use of bladed weapons of all sorts and have the trained bodies of a martial artist or acrobat. They are pretty opportunistic, however not to the point that they would use any means available. They just like to perform magic tricks and fool around with people, not even hesitating to use their own attractive features to confuse the enemy. They controlled 200 underlings.
Taitou District.
Kasuga Sora.
The Nenchaku (Adhesion) Banchou. He is a freak of nature having the body of a child hidden under thick layers of a slimy, sticky mucus that is covering every little bit of him, he is still far from normal even if he gets rid of that slimy shell. His tongue is extremely long and super sticky while being sharp enough to cut like a knife. His philosophy is "Eat bugs even to survive" meaning he believes in endurance and being persistent about life. Before his defeat he had 100 underlings.
Katsushika District.

The Kabuki Banchou. He wears kabuki make up and wants everything he does to appear "flashy" and with style. He is the son of the president of the Kaburagi, his favorite food is mitarashi dango with roosted green tea. He does everything using kabuki poses and stances referring to what he does as performances he hates cowards and cowardly moves which is ironic since his fighting style revolves around using hidden puppet-like arms to attack and keep his enemy at bay rather than fight himself. His loathing of cowards made him single out Hikyou Banchou as his opponent, the arena he picked was the simplest since it didn't give Hikyou Banchou any cover to set up any kind of trap or counterattack, He was beating Hikyou Banchou when his stomach started acting up which made him realize the 10 dangos he had before the battle were given to him by Hikyou Banchou (he didn't know since only a very few people know what Hikyou Banchou looks like outside of his banchou clothes) were laced with a very powerful laxative making him abandon the fight to rush to the bathroom which to his horror didn't have any toilet paper (which might have also been planned by Hikyou Banchou). After he tried to kill Akira's group and his own he tried to escape when he found a taxi and asked the driver to take him home when the driver offered him roasted green tea he happily accepted, only after he hearing the driver say it was his favorite he became afraid and realised it was Hikyou Banchou driving the taxi and had drugged his tea. Afterwards he never left home again and is now afraid of his favorite food. He had 300 underlings.
Adachi District.
Komori Shizuka.
The Kangoku (Prisoner) Banchou. He is a very large and muscular man who wears a small circular cage around his head. His biggest concern is the shortage of housing in Japan to which he says that when he is in control of Japan he would give everyone portable homes much like his steel box (which would require everyone to learn Sahaslare Mudra) which would settle the housing problem since the homes/boxes can be stacked or lined up creating in his words "a fashionable and innovated lifestyle". He is furious about the fact that Shirayukinomiya Kobushi's (Gouriki Banchou) family mansion is four time the size of tokyo dome leading him to say she douesn't the pain of Japan's poor housing situation. He had 400 underlings
Koutou District.
Homuraya Ryougen.
The Bakunetsu (Heat Burst) Banchou. His motto is "anyone whose not hot-blooded should die!" Due to him always being hot-blooded he is always yelling when he speaks, due to his weapon of choice he has quite a bit of heat resistance. He is a man that never backs down and can only 'explode' into battle, since backing down to him means defeat and those who are defeated aren't hot-blooded. To him hot-blooded means "To live life facing your goals with unwavering effort and bursting forward with fighting spirit" since many people in Japan look back they are not hot-blooded to him and to him have no value. He fought Akira on Mt Fugi, while an JSDF artillery unit was practice firing. During the fight he became overwhelmed by Akira's power and swallowed a bomb trying to commit suicide and take the others with him. Akira forced him to regurgitate the bomb and threw it away.

Dark Student Council.
A group of banchous that have already won their respective district war in the different sections of Japan and are the ones that are supposed to lead Japan when the project is completed. They are highly recognizable because they wear white banchou uniforms instead of the normal black ones. They are proceeding with the Damocles Project (destruction and rebirth of Japan) which is the next step of the district wars even after the Tokyo district project was cancelled.
Takaeshi Kongou.
The Nippon (All Japan) Banchou. Takeshi is Akira's older brother and has been a competitor in the 23 Districts Project his father established from the very start. However, he has only recently shown to become active after Akira had interfered with the plans of the project and managed to 'conquer' half of Tokyo's districts on his own. Despite Akiras claims to go and defeat both his father and brother, Takeshi has always been the stronger of the two brothers and moved up the ladder of success at an astonishing rate. After the efforts of the 23 Districts Project were crippled by Akira and forced to a standstill, Takeshi founded the Dark Student Council and changed the Organisations plans to a nation-wide battle. Each Banchou that manages to gain control over one of the remaining 46 prefectures outside of Tokyo is automatically appointed a seat in the Dark Student Council. Members wear white banchou uniforms and their plan is to destroy the civilisation in Japan under Takeshi's lead and the rebuild and restructure the country according to his will.
Kamitsu.
The Bungaku (Literature) Banchou. Kamitsu is Kongou Takeshi's private secretary. She is also one of the 4 Emperors which stand at the top of the Dark Student Council and all have exceptionally high stats, exceeding those of any other Banchou. Being extremely sharp minded, talented, strong and perceptive, as well as an advanced shapeshifter, she is the perfect person for coordinating all of Nippon Banchou's plans. 
Isaki Akira.
He is the Kenpei (Military Police) Banchou. Isaki is the executioner among the Four Emperors and he commands over most other, lower Banchous of the Dark Student Council. He is a psychotic yet very level-headed fighter who is obsessed with making his custom-made sword, Canaria, 'sing' in battle by cutting, smashing and gouging his opponents to death. He is quickly disappointed by weak opponents because they can't satisfy his blade and his own hunger for power. He and Iai Banchou once attended the same swordmanship dojo under Isaki Kenji's father, who was the master at that time. Kenpei Banchou killed his own master and father as he saw that he had surpassed him in terms of skill and power even in his teens.
Mudou Gou.
He is the Gedou (Heretic) Banchou. His codename is also his testament to the world; he can best be described as a ruthless coward who did all things from bullying and blackmailing as he grew up to now fighting dirty (but effectively) and taking hostages. He is in that aspect very similar to Hikyou Banchou however unlike Hikyou Banchou who fights for his siblings, Mudou fights for himself and truly is an evil coward. Mudou apparently is also prominent within the Dark Student Council for leading some sort of martial arts division. As one of the Four Emperors, he is right at the top of the Council and a very dangerous man who doesn't hesitate to exploit any weakness of his opponents. His arsenal includes explosives, lethal poisons, spikes hidden in his shoulders, and ceramic armor implanted under his skin.
Ryuuzenji Kounosuke.
He is the Ousama (Majesty) Banchou. He was originally a scientist who worked for the secret government organization Yatakarasu under whose project also Gokurou and Kongou Hamura participated to train to become the perfect supersoldier for Japan during World War II. Obsessed with the idea of creating a warrior that exceeds the limitations of the Kongou genes, Ousama Banchou did and still does cruel genetic experiments. Originally being small, feisty and weak, he even experimented on himself causing his torso and general body size to alter as he infused himself with the Kongou genes.
Gau Gau Banchou.
The Gau Gau (Chomp Chomp) Banchou.
Tsuchiya Mahori.
He is the Drill Banchou. One of the strongest fighters within the Dark Student Council, Drill Banchou is a fairly well-rounded Banchou with a unique set of tools and skills.

Despite working for the Dark Student Council, Drill Banchou is a very honorable, friendly, and relaxed person who likes children. After being defeated, he reforms saving Hikyo Banchou's family from Gedou Banchou. He has a crush on Sasori Banchou.
Unabara Banchou.
The Unabara (Sea) Banchou looks like a giant, prehistorical shark wearing a Japanese boys' school uniform, easily the largest Banchou seen in the series so far. He had a group of followers which were swordfish.
Gisou Banchou.
The Gisou (Disguise) Banchou. He originally looks like a very tall and slim man, but turns out to be a short man using prosthetic arms and legs to change his appearance. His abilities are based around Ninja in popular culture, such as spreading gunpowder dust in the air, and using whistling to hypnotize people. He is defeated by Nenbutsu Banchou.
Hakai Banchou.
He is the Hakai (Destruction) Banchou. Destruction Banchou was created during the Pacific War as the ultimate supersoldier and secret weapon to defeat the Americans. He is created with genes of the Kongou lingeage, thus inheriting all their physical traits and more such as extreme durability, hardened skin and regeneration. Kongou Homura's father sacrificed his life to seal this dangerous weapon deep within the Earth, binding and wrapping his body around Hakai Banchou. Hakai Banchou was supposed to be dropped in America and destroy the country. Due to him being man-made he has the power of regeneration, he doesn't feel fatigue or pain, and does not require food, water or air (he was sealed in tightly-packed earth for more than 60 years) and he does not age. He is destroyed by Kongo Banchou.

Manchurochelys

Manchurochelys is an extinct genus of turtle in the order Paracryptodira. It existed during the early Cretaceous of what is now northeast China. It has been found in the Jianshangou Bed of West Liaoning's Yixian Formation. However, it is a rarely found fossil.
"Manchurochelys" was first named by Endo and Shikama in 1942, and contains the single species, "M. manchoukuoensis" (sometimes misspelled "M. manchouensis"). A second species, "M. liaoxensis", was named in 1995 but was later shown to be a species of "Ordosemys". "Manchurochelys" was a relative of the modern-day snapping turtle.

Gerry Clark

Gerald Stanley Clark MBE (9 May 1927 – June 1999) was a New Zealand sailor, writer and ornithologist. He is notable for his ornithological research work on subantarctic islands and for his circumnavigation of Antarctica in his self-built yacht "Totorore".
Early years.
Clark was born in Colchester, England, and educated at boarding school and later at the Thames Nautical Training College, then known as HMS "Worcester". In 1944, unable to join the Royal Navy because of a visual defect, he joined the British Merchant Navy, serving with the Union-Castle Line on the Liberty ship "Samflora", and completing his cadet training during a two-year cruise without home leave. Upon discharge from the "Samflora" he joined the Straits Steamship Company, based in Singapore, as a junior officer on small ships trading through the islands of South East Asia.
In 1951 Clark returned to England to attend the Warsash Maritime Centre at Southampton to sit for his Master’s Certificate. While he was there he married Marjorie Ellen Bates who later joined him in Singapore where the couple had four daughters. There Clark was promoted first to Captain and then to Assistant Marine Superintendent of a fleet of fifty vessels.
New Zealand.
In 1958 Clark and his family moved to Kerikeri in New Zealand where he bought the Homelands Orchard. Although they struggled at first, eventually they successfully pioneered the organic farming of citrus and sub-tropical fruits in the area.
Clark also attended evening classes in boat building, building his first yacht, the 7 m "Ketiga" in 1968, in which he took part in the first Single-handed Trans-Tasman Yacht Race in 1970. In 1973 he sailed around New Zealand, including the Chatham, Auckland and Campbell Islands.
The Totorore expedition.
The Totorore expedition was conceived as a circum-Antarctic voyage to study the seabirds of the Southern Ocean in order to further their conservation. Clark spent seven years building the 10 m yacht "Totorore" (the Maori name for the Antarctic Prion) of Kauri timber, completing and launching her in 1982.
The "Totorore" left Kerikeri on 26 February 1983, eventually returning on 6 November 1986, 3 years, 8 months and 16 days later, having travelled some 71,000 km eastwards, around and about the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic Peninsula, visiting numerous islands to survey and count seabirds. The most significant ornithological work was carried out in southern Chile where new colonies of several species were discovered, and in South Georgia where comprehensive and accurate counts were made of Wandering Albatrosses and King Penguins along the long coastline. During much of the expedition Clark was accompanied and aided by one or two companions, but sometimes, as on a late leg of the voyage between Marion Island and Fremantle, Australia, he was alone and frequently imperilled by rough seas and equipment failure.
Following his return, honours received by Clark included:
For the next twelve years Clark continued his interest in seabird conservation and New Zealand’s subantarctic islands by making numerous trips in the "Totorore" to assist researchers from the Department of Conservation to count, map and study seabirds. It was in the course of one of these expeditions, to recover satellite transmitters used to track albatrosses breeding on the Antipodes Islands, that the "Totorore" disappeared on about 12 June 1999 off the south coast of Antipodes Island, along with Clark and his companion Roger Sale.[http://www.ranui.co.nz/totorore.html]
Publications.
Clark wrote a book, based upon extracts from his diary, about the Totorore expedition “The Totorore Voyage’’ first published in 1988 by Century Hutchinson, Auckland. He also produced reports and published papers in various journals and bulletins on his research, including:

<doc id="19006537" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19006537" title="Malibu Hydro">
Malibu Hydro

Malibu Hydro System was designed to provide electricity to the Malibu Club in Canada. This hydro system starts from a high alpine lake where water is diverted from the lake through a steel penstock to a power house nearly below near the shore of Jervis Inlet. The flow of water turns a pelton wheel which is attached to a generator to create electricity. The electricity is then transmitted to camp by a submarine cable running under Jervis Inlet at a high enough voltage to ensure little loss. Power is then distributed throughout camp on the existing and upgraded electrical system.
Source.
The hydro turbine is feed by a yearlong creek called McCannel Creek which is directly across the Jervis Inlet to Malibu which is about two miles (3 km). The source of the creek is a lake called McCannel Lake which is at an elevation of . At the outlet, a dam was built to maintain the lake level and control the flow of the creek
Weir (Item A).
A small dam was built at the lake outlet to aid in maintaining the water at a higher level by limiting the discharge into the creek. The weir has a large pipe and valve in its base to pass the minimum required required to maintain the creek. This is in addition to the water which will be spilled to create power.
Intake (Item B).
Water regulated at the lake will flow down the creek from the level to the level. Here a weir was built across the creek that forms a large deep pool from which the penstock draws water at a rate of up to .
Power House (Item C & D).
The power house is a building that houses the turbine, generator, and the necessary equipment to control and distribute the electricity for Malibu. It is located a short distance above the beach. The following diagram and table explains what happens once the water flow reaches the Power house (read the diagram right to left)
Power Line (Item E).
The electrical power is transmitted via an underwater power line consisting of three parallel conductors. Transformers at the hydro generator will raise the generator voltage from 600 to 15,000. Transmission voltage will be at 15,000 volts. Another transformer at camp will step the line voltage down to 120 and 208 volts for use at camp.

Kronos Digital Entertainment

Kronos Digital Entertainment was a U.S.–based video game developer founded by Stan Liu in 1992. They first garnered attention for their contract work for Sierra On-Line, most notably the groundbreaking intro sequence they created for "King's Quest VI". They eventually began to develop original properties, beginning with their visually appealing early 3D fighting games, Criticom, Dark Rift and Cardinal Syn (referred to as the "Trilogy of Terror" by one gaming journalist). The organization later gained greater critical and commercial success for the Fear Effect series with Eidos, although Kronos retains all rights to the franchise. Kronos was busy developing the third installment in that series, "Fear Effect Inferno", when publisher Eidos discontinued funding for the project following a major restructuring of their budget. The developer then shopped it around to other publishers but were unable to secure another deal to get the game finished. The company disbanded soon after, with "" being their final released game.

PRR D4

The Pennsylvania Railroad's steam locomotive class D4 (formerly Class C (anthracite), pre-1895) comprised thirty-seven anthracite-burning 4-4-0 locomotives intended for general passenger and freight service on the PRR's New Jersey lines, constructed at the railroad's own Altoona Works during 1873–1890.
They shared many parts with other standard classes.
This design differed from the Class C (later D3) mainly in its longer firebox to burn slower-burning anthracite coal. Like all the early standardized 4-4-0s on the PRR, the Class C (Anthracite) had a wagon-top boiler with steam dome and a firebox between the two driving axles.
In 1875, fifteen locomotives were either built or converted (sources differ) with drivers for fast passenger service on the New Jersey lines. These were classified Class CA (Anthracite) or later D4a, and handled this traffic until 1881, when they were replaced by heavier power.

Maschinenfabrik Esslingen

Maschinenfabrik Esslingen (ME), was a German engineering firm that manufactured locomotives, tramways, railway wagons, roll-blocks, technical equipment for the railways, (turntables and traversers), bridges, steel structures, pumps and boilers.
Founding.
It was founded by Emil Kessler on 11 March 1846 in Stuttgart, as a result of an initiative of the Kingdom of Württemberg to create a railway industry that was not dependent on foreign manufacturers. Emil Kessler brought vital experience from his time with the engineering works in Karlsruhe, where he had been a member of the board since 1837 and the sole director since 1842.
The foundation stone of the new factory was laid at Esslingen am Neckar on 4 May 1846. One year later, in October 1847, the first locomotive ordered by the Royal Württemberg State Railways ("Königlich Württembergische Staats-Eisenbahnen") or "K.W.St. E." was delivered.
History.
After the death of Emil Kessler in 1867 his 26-year old son, Emil Kessler, took over the factory. He ran it until his death in 1895. From 1907 another Kessler took the helm of the engineering works: Emil Kessler's youngest son, Ludwig Kessler. 
The one thousandth locomotive delivered in 1870 was given the name "KESSLER" to commemorate the founder of the factory. The engineering works worked closely with the Royal Württemberg State Railways so that almost all new engines for the railway company were built at Esslingen.
The firm earned a very good reputation, initially at home, then increasingly abroad. Several takeovers of other companies ("Maschinenfabrik Gebr. Decker & Co." in 1881, "Maschinen- & Kesselfabrik G. Kuhn" in 1902), the formation of "Costruzioni Meccaniche Saronno" (Italy) in 1887 and in 1913 the construction of a new factory at Mettingen demonstrated its success. One phase was the construction of ships for inland waters at Ulm and Friedrichshafen, begun in 1852 and stopped by 1858, that saw it through the time of economic crisis after 1848. 50 boats for the river Danube, two steamships for the river Neckar, two steamers and two tugs for Lake Constance and were the result of this thoroughly successful venture. Longer-lived was the firms involvement in steel structures and bridging, that it continued with until the end. 
By the 1960s Maschinenfabrik Esslingen had delivered several thousand steam and diesel locomotives worldwide, including numerous special designs. It had a particular reputation for the construction of cog locomotives in many variations, including locomotives for Riggenbach, Abt and Strub rack railways. It was one of these engines that was the last steam locomotive to be made in Esslingen: on 21 October 1966 the last cog locomotive left the factory bound for Indonesia. 
The company was also involved in the production of electric locomotives, for example, in 1912 for the Wendelsteinbahn. After 1920 a batch of accumulator cars was produced, mainly for coal mines and industrial railways.
In addition, internal combustion engined locomotives were built, such as the small diesel locomotive, the "Köf", and the Esslingen railbus. 
Between 1956 and 1965, over 350 Class SSB GT4 trams were built in Esslingen for the Stuttgart tramways, which were still in operation at the end of 2007. Even the cable car vehicles in Stuttgart were made at Esslingen.
Demise of Locomotive Construction.
Finally the ME became a subsidiary of the "Gutehoffnungshütte". In 1965 Daimler-Benz AG bought the company in order to use it factory facilities for its production and the construction of railway vehicles ceased. Today (2007) the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen AG still exists, but is just a real estate leasing company.
Preservation of Locomotives.
Today, old locomotives are rebuilt by the "Verein zur Erhaltung der Lokomotiven der ME" (Society for the Preservation of ME Locomotives) and handed over to museum railways for everyday operations. This society has its base in the old board rooms of the engineering works in Emil-Kessler-Straße in Mettingen on the factory site of Daimler AG.

Putcher fishing

Putcher fishing is a type of fishing (usually of salmon) which employs a large number of putcher baskets, set in a fixed wooden frame, against the tide in a river estuary, notably on the River Severn, in England and South East Wales.
History.
The trapping of fish is probably one of the oldest known forms of fishing. The exact origin of putcher fishing along the River Severn is not known, but a memorial song recorded in 1663 mentions two fixed engines operating “between the Hill and the Pile” – undoubtedly references to Hill Farm and the Pill Reen or “Monksditch” at Goldcliff. Evidence for the use of putchers in medieval times has recently been revealed during construction of the Second Severn Crossing 
A salmon fishery of some kind was probably in operation at the time of the Priory at Goldcliff and then passed, at the time of the Dissolution, to Eton College. In the 1920s there were ranks holding some 2,400 baskets. The revenue from this enterprise provided an endowment to the Church of the Blessed Virgin at Eton. In addition, fresh salmon were provided for the breakfast of the scholars at the college. The fishery was owned for much of the later part of the twentieth century by Mr John Williams who employed one full-time fisherman Mr Wyndham Howells. The lease for the fishery was subsequently taken over by a Newport fishmonger. The fishery at Porton was acquired in 1902 by the Pontypool Park Estate and was for many years run during the fishing season run by Mr Keyte, a member of a long-established family of Goldcliff farmers.
Fish traps in Wales.
During the later half of the twentieth century numerous fixed weirs, installed in rivers and shores throughout Wales for the purpose of catching fish, fell into disuse. In addition to fixed traps, however, Wales had a large number of removable traps, also known as “hecks”, “crucks”, “cribs” and “inscale”. The basket traps used at Goldcliff and Porton in the Severn Estuary were known as “putchers”.
Fishing for salmon using many of these devices was forbidden in England and Wales by the Salmon Fishery Acts of 1861 and 1865, except under grant or charter, or by the right of “immemorial usage”. Indeed, Special Constables were appointed by the Act of 1865 to enquire into the legality of all “fixed engines” being used to catch salmon. Only if proven legal would the constables then issue a certificate of legality. In this way the number, size and position of all salmon weirs became fixed for all time.
Goldcliff and Porton.
In South East Wales the baskets at Porton and Goldcliff came under the jurisdiction of the Usk River Authority and were permitted to be used as “privileged fixed engines”. Two others at nearby Undy and Redwick, also on the shoreline of the Severn Estuary, fell out of use on the 1930s. The Wye River Authority operated a weir of 500 baskets at Beachley in Gloucestershire and a number of other weirs were operated by the Severn River Authority on both sides of the River Severn.
From 1913 to 1950 fisherman George Whittaker was employed at the Goldcliff Fishery, first by Mr Fennell and later by Mr Burge. Whittaker was to become a notable source of information about putcher fishing there. The Putchers at Goldcliff were traditionally open in weave, being constructed from hazel rods and withy saplings cut in the autumn from a withy plantation at Llanwern. The baskets were made and repaired by the fishermen themselves during the closed season between August 14 and May 1. The wooden putcher was gradually superseded, from 1942, by galvanised steel wire baskets and then later by baskets of aluminium wire, both of which were more seawater resistant. After 1952 the baskets at Goldcliff and Porton were exclusively aluminium, although the traditional measurements were strictly adhered to by the modern manufacturers. The galvanised putchers with square mesh were supplied flat and wired into shape by the fishermen. The aluminium putchers, with a diamond mesh, were supplied ready-formed, although at Goldcliff they were strengthened with additional wire bands. All-wire putchers were fixed to the wooden ranks by means of the two staples hammered into the wooden rails on the ranks.
Somerset.
Since the 18th century salmon fisheries were associated with the Clifford estate at Yearsey and Black Rock at West Stretcholt. By the mid 19th century the de Mauley family claimed three sites in the River Parrett near Pawlett, Cannington, and Black Rock where four men had 1,000 putchers, also called "butts". Between 1868 and 1873 the number of licensed butts fell from 1,360 to 450. Salmon putchers remained in the river in 1920 and were sold with the de Mauley estate.
Putcher construction.
In 1970 a few dozen of the traditional willow baskets were made and installed by the fishermen at Goldcliff. To make a putcher by hand, a low bench was used approximately high and square into which 9 holes were made, in a circle in diameter. Green withy or hazel rods were then split into three using an oak cleaver held in the maker’s hand. The split lengths were then inserted into the holes to make a conical shape and a withy ring was plaited round them close to the surface of the bench. Nine shorter rods, either complete or in thirds, were then inserted into the ring, with two more rings being plaited around to secure them, one halfway up and another near the top. A nose ring was then plaited. The putcher was then pulled out of the bench, the nose ring attached and a spiral `worm' was added from the narrow end to the middle. A base ring was woven at the end of the basket. Any longer rods could then be trimmed and the basket was ready for use. The basket was expected to last for two fishing seasons, possibly also for a third following repair.
Ranks.
A strong timber frame or “rank” was required to hold the rows of putchers, built across the main tidal flow of the river. The fish, with fins trapped by the weave and unable to easily swim backwards, were then trapped in the conical baskets. The very high difference between high and low tide in the Severn Estuary enabled the ranks to be long and thus economically productive. Goldcliff originally had three ranks – the “Flood”, the “Ebb” and the “Putt”, able to carry a total of 2,327 baskets. A number of smaller baskets were especially constructed to fill any smaller spaces in the rank. Although there was no great advantage to be had from trapping smaller fish, the lack of any holes in the rank presented a more complete “wall of traps” through which it was more difficult for any fish to pass. The single putcher rank at Porton could carry some 600 baskets. Although the fishermen’s intimate knowledge of the seasonal height of the tides meant wasted that un-submerged baskets were not set, once fixed the baskets were typically removed only if the fish could not be released, or to allow repairs. 
The uprights of the ranks were generally made of green larch or green elm, some long and from 8 to in diameter and sunk into the foreshore by between 6 and . Green timber was preferred as the salt seawater would preserve it and allow use for perhaps up to ten years. Elm tended to be more durable then larch, although all would eventually start to rot from the top and would need to be replaced. Some poles at Goldcliff, probably those at the seaward ends of the ranks, were reported to have lasted for forty years. The post holes were bored using a rock auger and bar, with the debris removed using a long-handle implement called a “spoon”. The uprights were then beaten into the ground, in pairs, five feet apart, using an iron lined yew beetle.
Between each pair of upstream and downstream uprights a space of six feet was left for laying the baskets, with each pair braced with diagonals and transverse beams top and bottom. To the outside of this structure horizontal rails were then nailed, the first some from the ground, and then at regular two foot intervals above Two or three narrow gaps were left in the lower rails to allow access. Rows of baskets were then stapled to the rails, at a downward angle of about 20 degrees. All the baskets in a rank would point the same way, with the open end set either against the incoming or outgoing tide. Added strength was given to some ranks by using angled props against the front post of every fourth pair.
Fishing practices.
For reasons of religious observance, until the early years of the nineteenth century, the putchers' open ends had to be closed at least between noon on Saturday until 6 am the following Monday. The practice suggested strongly the origins of the fishery with the Benedictine Priory at Goldcliff.
On normal fishing days, as soon as the tide had exposed the baskets, they needed to be inspected by the fisherman who used a pronged staff to push any trapped fish back towards the basket entrance. Returning along the other side of the rank, the fish were then collected in a sack. At Goldcliff a bicycle, with trays front and back, was used to make collection easier. Running repairs could also be carried out at the same time with hammer and nails.
Fish from the ebb-ranks were by necessity fresher than those taken from the flood-ranks, since on the latter the tide had to both rise and fall before the fishermen could collect the catch.
Since the fisherman would need to work with the tides, inspection and collection needed to occur around the clock and thus the brick workshop was equipped with bed and cooking equipment. A fish store was also required where the freshly collected fish could be stored in tight-lidded lead-lined boxes packed with broken ice. The fish from both Goldcliff and Porton were sent to Billingsgate market in London. The Porton fishery was also equipped with a smokery at one time, using oak shavings, but this venture was apparently not long lasting.
The "kype", a basket similar to the putcher but more elaborate, for catching shrimp and eel, seems also to have been constructed for use at Goldcliff.

Rowe Harding

W. Rowe Harding (10 September 1901 – 10 February 1991) was a Welsh international rugby union wing who played club rugby for Swansea. An intelligent player, Harding played for several teams at club and international level. In 1926 he attended Cambridge University and played for Cambridge in a varsity match. Rowe retired from rugby at the age of 28 when he was called to the bar, and would later become a Circuit Court judge in 1953. Harding spent his later life connected with all manner of sports. He was Welsh Rugby Union vice-president from 1953–56, chairman and president of Glamorgan County Cricket Club, president of Swansea Lawn Tennis and Squash Rackets Club and patron of Cwmgors RFC.
Harding was a published author of the rugby book, "Rugby Reminiscences and Opinions" which is noted for its forthright and blunt viewpoints on the issues affecting Welsh rugby at the time, for example, while addressing the Welsh Rugby Union in 1950 "The Rugby League is only an infant, but it wants strangling."
Club career.
After playing his early career with Loughor, Harding was selected to play for Llanelli and his natural speed was utilised on the right wing. After only eight games he was switched to the left to play outside Albert Jenkins. In his first game in his new position, in a game against Penarth, Harding was given three perfect passes and dropped all three. After this performance he was dropped by Llanelli and transferred to Swansea. On November 8, Harding made his debut for Swansea against Cambridge University.
In 1926, while a student studying Law at Cambridge, he would play for Cambridge in four varsity matches, scoring tries in the 1926 and 1927 match, and captaining the university in 1927.
International rugby career.
Rowe gained his first international cap against England on 20 January 1923, which Wales lost 7-3. He would gain 17 caps in total scoring five tries for his country. In 1924 Rowe missed the home nation matches against England and Scotland after breaking his collar-bone at Christmas; but later in the season, in the match against France at the Stade Colombes, Rowe captained Wales for the first time, an honour he would achieve on another three occasions.
In 1924 Rowe was chosen to represent the British Isles on their Tour of South Africa. Rowe was chosen to play in three tests.
International matches played.

Elizabeth and Rowe Harding Reserve.
Harding has a wildlife reserve named after himself and his wife, after they donated sections of the land to the Wildlife trust for South and South West Wales. The reserve is called the "Elizabeth and Rowe Harding Reserve" and consists of a woodland and quarry face near Ilston village in the Gower. The site is open to the public and is noted for its flora and as a nesting site for kestrels.

Springfield School Karachi

The Springfield School in Karachi, Pakistan was founded on September 1, 1966. Mrs. Agha co-founder of the school died on 25 April 2009.
History.
Springfield School was founded on September 1, 1966 by husband and wife Mirza Nadir Agha and Nusrat Agha in a rented bungalow on the corner of Karsaz Road and Shahra-e-Faisal. O levels were introduced in 1986.
Academics.
Springfield's idea of grooming of its students is based around its motto of Labour, Knowledge and Integrity. Right from its earliest batches, there is an extensive focus on academics and in particular on subjects such as Mathematics, General Science, History and English Literature. Revolutionary ideas are discussed in class and students are often encouraged to participate in discussions pertaining to current issues confronting humanity. A very strong emphasis on discipline has ensured that students tend to focus on their development and consequently, alumni of this institution have a reputation for being very hard working in their professional lives. Equality of all citizens is preached from Grade One, as students are all required to wear identical uniforms (including shoes) on a daily basis. Homework in English Language, Urdu and Mathematics is a practice right from Kindergarten, and is graded on a daily basis to provide feedback and monitor the progress of students. Examinations are conducted twice a year along with 'tests' on at least a bi-weekly basis, for which students are expected to come prepared to school. Declamation and public speaking competitions are a frequent occurrence and students are encouraged to be creative as a group in various items performed in the annual school concert. Recently, there has been talk of making current affairs a separate subject in itself. 
Sexual-education and culinary practices/table-manners should be taught as subjects at the school level and are suggestions for improvement to the current administration. Despite being a Muslim country, it is important Pakistan's young minds are taught the importance of family planning from a very young age and for that sexual-education is a must.
A large percentage of Springfield's alumni proceed to seek higher education at local institutions in Pakistan. Since they usually put roots in Pakistan, Springfield is certainly a significant contributor towards the development of The Pakistani Nation. Alumni from Springfield pursue livelihoods in an entire breadth of careers ranging from Entrepreneurship to Medicine to Engineering and even Civil and Military Services.It is quite a good school and i'm sure it will make progress.
Campus.
There is a field which was mainly used to play cricket but now it is used to play baseball. There is a library, a hall (which is often used for debates), a science laboratory for experiments and science practicals, and a computer lab. The library, despite being small in size, houses an array of books covering almost all subjects, which are of very high quality.
Location.
Springfield School is located in K.D.A., the most prestigious locality of Karachi. In spite of being in a central area it is ideally situated in a secluded corner providing a serene and calm environment to the students. The school has been constructed on a plot measuring 9573 sq. yards with all the three sections, Junior, Middle & Senior, housed side by side functioning in a building specifically designed for this purpose.
School motto.
Labour, Knowledge, Integrity 
Labour: Quaid-e-Azam’s words “Work, work and more work,” provide inspiration for us to follow in his footsteps. 
Knowledge: In today’s world, knowledge and progress are synonyms. Only knowledge can guide and lead us onwards. 
Integrity: Without Integrity both labour and knowledge are blind and stumble along meaninglessly. Integrity alone makes life worthwhile and is its own reward, notwithstanding the fact that it elicits substantial material rewards as well. 
Our motto provides the pillars on which the school and the character of our students is founded.
Founders.
Springfield School was established by Mirza Nadir Agha on the 1st of September, 1966 as an English medium school offering education to classes from Nursery to VIIIth with the additional facility of a boarding school for boys only, while the school itself was coeducational. 
Indeed, it was Sir Mirza’s farsightedness and vision of the future, which was responsible for propelling us in the right direction. Today the school prepares students to sit for the GCE O' Levels examinations from the University of Cambridge, UK. The school enjoys a unique reputation for its academic excellence as well as its character building and discipline.

St Wulfram's Church, Grantham

St Wulfram's Church, Grantham, is a parish church in the Church of England in Grantham in Lincolnshire. The church has been a Grade I listed building, since 8 May 1950.
In his book "England's Thousand Best Churches", Simon Jenkins begins his description of St Wulfram's: "Here is the finest steeple in England".
History.
It is believed that a church stood on the site long before Norman times, but of the original Saxon church probably only a few stones, near the organ loft, remain. The church was totally altered by the Normans and the remains of their church may still be seen in the nave. From its foundation until the 18th century, it was the only church in the town, helping to explain its size in comparison with the churches at nearby Stamford. Although there were a number of religious cells in Grantham, including a Franciscan Friary, the Grey Friars, west of the market place, the wealth of the medieval wool trade was channelled into St Wulfram's Church.
The north aisle arcades, except for the two west bays, date from before 1180. The original Norman church was ruined by fire when it was hit by lightning in 1222. The north aisle was rebuilt in about 1250. In 1280 the church expanded westwards over what was the market-place. The huge piers in the west end of the church have many 13th-century mason's marks, as do the spiral stairs to the belfry. In 1450 the north aisle was extended, and some time after 1496 St Katherine's Chapel was added by the Hall family. In 1550 the south aisle was lengthened and the Lady Chapel was built.
The church was restored in 1866-67 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. Of interest are window frames from different periods, the use of ballflower ornament and the crypt chapel. The north porch was built to house relics of St Wulfram (possibly an arm bone), and the chained library occupies a room over the south porch which was once a priests' living room.
Architecture.
The church is long by feet wide.
Tower and spire.
The design of the church, which is built from local limestone, was probably influenced by Salisbury Cathedral. The church's chief feature is the slender crocketed spire which stands high. The spire is the sixth highest in the country (Salisbury and Norwich Cathedrals' are higher), and fourth highest of any parish church, after the Church of St. Walburge, Preston, St. James Church, Louth, and the St Mary Redcliffe. It is the third highest of any Anglican parish church in the UK, after St. James' Louth and St Mary's, Redcliffe and second highest in Lincolnshire, after St. James', Louth.
Jenkins describes the tower and spire thus:
"The tower now rises free of the roofline of the aisles, with two tiers of blind arcading. Then come two stages of bell openings, one with two windows the next with just one, as if to increase the tension. The tower is carefully tapered, with lines accentuated by angle buttresses. Four pinnacles now effortlessly conceal the shift from square tower into octagonal spire, which rises from its small broaches in a single final thrust. The taper of the spire seems perfectly judged, with its ribs and three tiers of diminishing lucarnes covered in ballflower, as if infested with golden snails. Grantham's tower ranks with any masterpiece of English art. Such was the effect on Ruskin that he (allegedly) swooned on first seeing it."
The tower is not symmetrical as one corner buttress accommodates a narrow 211 step spiral staircase which rises to the bell-ringing chamber and the parapet beyond. While later churches had two, St Wulfram's has only one. The parapet around the tower is waist high and is above the ground. Once a year, during the annual heritage week at the start of September, areas normally kept closed, including the parapet, are open to the public.
The tower's west front has 12 medieval niches or tabernacles containing modern statues. The bottom four statues, the gift of L. F. Catlin unveiled in 1921, are of St Michael, St Wulfram, the Blessed Virgin Mary and St John the Baptist. The upper eight statues, installed in 1956 are of St Luke, St Matthew, St Mark, St John the Evangelist, and below them St Paul, St Aidan, St Augustine and Dr John Hine a former bishop of Grantham with a cat playing with his robe tassel.
In 2013 an appeal was launched to save the spire.
Crypt.
The crypt chapel was probably dedicated to the Holy Trinity and was originally entered from outside. A staircase was built in the 15th century allowing access from the church interior. The crypt door and chests are the only remaining examples of medieval woodwork in the church.
The crypt has been used as a depository for the relic of St Wulfram, as a charnel house when the graveyard became full, and a store-room for church valuables and corporation records. In 1808 the church silver was stolen from the crypt and never recovered. So many pilgrims have visited the crypt that the stone steps have worn down and been inverted. The stone in front of the altar has also been worn away by the knees of pilgrims.
Library.
The church has the first library in England to be endowed under a civic authority, the Borough of Grantham, not in the possession of a cathedral, church, college or school. It may thus be regarded as the country's first "public library", even though kept in a church. In 1598 Francis Trigge, the rector of Welbourn, gave £100 for a small library of books for the clergy and "literate laity" of Grantham. The books were most probably obtained from Cambridge. More than 80 volumes are kept secured by chains. The earliest book, printed in Naples in 1476, is found in no other library. There are 356 separate items and the collection has recently been examined, repaired and catalogued. The library is housed above the south porch, where a squint window allows viewers in the library to see all parts of the church, but to remain almost invisible from the body of the church.
Fixtures and fittings.
An organ from 1640, the gift of Dr Farmery was destroyed in 1643 during the English Civil War.
The present organ by John Harris and John Byfield dates from 1735. It was rebuilt by George Pike England in 1809 and 1833, by Forster and Andrews between 1845 and 1868, by Norman and Beard in 1906 (producing the organ that may be heard today), by Rushworth and Dreaper in 1952, by Cousans of Lincoln in 1972, and by Phillip Wood and Sons of Huddersfield in 1993-94 when a fourth manual was added. The case designed by Sir Walter Tapper RA took eight years to complete. The old organ case now encloses the choir vestry in the north west corner of the church. The specification for the organ, regarded as one of the finest in Lincolnshire, can be found at the National Pipe Organ Register
The reredos, designed by Arthur Blomfield who submitted drawings in 1881, was constructed in 1883/84 by Healey, Butler and Blaine of London and dedicated to Canon G. Body. The work was paid for by subscription. In 1901/02 four of its 19 panels were raised and seven new panels added. It was mounted in a wide elaborately-carved frame and moved forward from the east window onto a green and white marble plinth.
There are 12 bells in the tower (13 counting the "Ting Tang") used for English change ringing and for the clock chimes. Since two trebles were added in 2003, there are two separate rings. The original ring of ten bells was cast in 1946, with a tenor 32 cwt 1 qtr 11 lbs (in note C#), and a light ring of eight bells with a tenor of 10 cwt 1 qtr 11 lbs (in note G#). The oldest bell is the Sanctus bell or Ting Tang, given by Ann, widow of the Reverend Hurst, chaplain to King Charles l in 1674. In 1946 the bells were removed during the rebuilding of the spire and re-cast by Taylor of Loughborough. Two bells, both trebles, cast by Taylor, were added in 2003.
A brass cross on the super-altar was designed by Arthur Blomfield in 1886. The medieval font from about 1496 has an ornate cover shaped like a church spire designed by Sir Walter Tapper in 1899 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The cover's interior is decorated with carvings of Edward the Confessor, St Hugh and St Wulfram. Before the cover was added, the font stood on a low stone plinth but is now raised. Each of the font's eight faces, its shaft and base is covered with carvings which are worn and damaged, but appear to show the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Circumcision of Jesus, the Baptism of Jesus, Christ blessing little children, the Transfiguration, the sacrifice of Isaac and the Three Wise Men. Emblems and devices on the underside of the font include a pelican and a Tudor rose which may suggest the font's donor was Richard Foxe, from Ropsley, who re-founded the King's School, Grantham. Four emblems - an angel, a lion, an ox and an eagle may denote the Four Evangelists. The font shaft has seven figures and an empty eighth space. St. Andrew and his cross are identifiable. The font base has roses, quatrefoils and masks.
Tombs.
Along the south wall are the remains of two 14th-century tombs of wealthy local merchants. Near the east end is the Harrington tomb and nearer the parish clerk's office is the tomb of Richard Saltby. The faces of angels above both tombs have mostly been cut in half, mutilation believed to have occurred during The Reformation or the English Civil War.
Hatchments and arms.
On the south wall are royal coats of arms; and five hatchments commemorating Anne, widow of Sir Richard Cust, Bt., who died 29 December 1779, John Manners, illegitimate son of Lord William Manners, William Richard Middlemore of Somerby Hall, born 1713, died unmarried on 31 May 1772 and buried at St Wulfram's on 2 June 1772.
The royal arms are those of Queen Elizabeth I, with the motto VIVAT REGINA over the arms of the Grantham Borough used between 1405 and 1603 and the Stuart Arms, installed at the Restoration and used until 1701, over the borough arms incorporating an oak leaf as a reference to King Charles II.

Cartoon Network (South Korea)

Cartoon Network South Korea is a cable and satellite television channel created by Turner Broadcasting, a unit of Time Warner which primarily shows animated programming. It was launched on November 11, 2006.
History.
2006–2008: City Era.
On November 11, 2006, the bumpers were replaced with 3-D animations of a 'city' that all the Cartoon Network toons lived in. Show-specific bumpers were replaced with 3-D animations of a well-known scene from the particular show (e.g.: a Dexter's Laboratory bumper would feature Dexter's house, a Powerpuff Girls bumper would feature most likely the PPG household, and so forth). The retro, checker board logo was replaced with the 'CN' city-style logo of today. In 2006, several new Cartoon Network originals premiered, including Robotboy, The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, Camp Lazlo, Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi, My Gym Partner's a Monkey and Squirrel Boy. The "Cartoon Cartoons" moniker previously used for Cartoon Network originals was also dropped in 2006.
2008–2011: New Wave Era.
On August 31, 2008, the format of Cartoon Network's bumpers and commercials changed, and the Cartoon Network Theatre and Fridays Flicks were renamed to Cartoon Network Popcorn. This mimics a similar decision made by Cartoon Network Southeast Asia, with the major visual theme being the recurring 'dynamic line' on the network's official website and also in all the Station IDs, bumpers, etc. During the New Wave Era much of Cartoon Network's comedy/fun-oriented programs (such as Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends and Camp Lazlo), which were popular in the early-mid-2000s, are being shown much less frequently on the network, making way for more anime (such as Kiteretsu Daihyakka and Kaibutsu-kun) and action-oriented shows (such as Ben 10, Ben 10 Alien Force, Secret Saturdays).

El Amor (Azúcar Moreno album)

El Amor is the seventh studio album by Spanish duo Azúcar Moreno, released on Sony International in 1994.
The album saw Azúcar Moreno making their first collaborations with some of the top names in the world of Latin music in the United States, such as former Miami Sound Machine member Emilio Estefan Jr., composer and producer Estéfano, Kike Santander and Juan R. Marquez, the team behind numerous hits for world-renowned artists such as Julio Iglesias, Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada, Shakira and Chayanne. The title track and the biggest hit "El Amor" was featured in the Hollywood movie "The Specialist", starring Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. The extended 12" mix of the song was included on the CD version of "El Amor" and a special edition of the soundtrack album called "The Specialist - The Remixes" featured Tony Moran's twelve minutes forty-two seconds "Multiple Orgasm Mix", and the song managed to cross over to the US dance charts, reaching #50 on "Billboard"'s Hot Dance Club Play listing in early 1995. The follow-up single "No Será Facil", produced by the same team, was written by Gloria Estefan and originally recorded by the Miami Sound Machine on their 1982 album "Rio". Further hits from the album include "No Tendré Piedad" and "Hay Que Saber Perder".
As opposed to Azúcar Moreno's previous albums "Bandido" and "Mambo", "El Amor" did not include any cover versions of songs from the Anglosaxon world of rock and pop but it did see the Salazár sisters interpreting material by some of the Spanish and Latin American music scene's most acknowledged songwriters and artists. Cherito Jimenez' merengue "Nadie Como Tu" was originally recorded by The New York Band in 1989. "Ladrón de Amores" was penned by Spanish singer-songwriter Rosana Arbelo. "Ando Buscando un Amor" was written by one of the Dominican Republic's leading composers and singers, Victor Victor (full name Victor José Victor Rojas) and "De Lo Que Te Has Perdido" is one of legendary Mexican singer Marco Antonio Muñiz' signature tunes. "Desnúdate, Desnúdame" was originally one of Spanish singer-songwriter Miguel Gallardo's biggest hits in the 70's. "A Galope" was a newly composed collaboration between Gallardo and the writers of Azúcar Moreno's breakthrough hit "Bandido", Raúl Orellana and Jaime Stinus.
"El Amor" became Azúcar Moreno's breakthrough on the North American market and won them the prize for Best Group Of The Year at Billboard's Latin Music Awards in 1994.
"El Amor" and "No Será Facil" were both included on Azúcar Moreno's first greatest hits compilation "Mucho Azúcar - Grandes Éxitos" in 1997.

Cavalry division (Soviet Union)

One of the first cavalry divisions in the Red Army was the 1st Cavalry Division (Soviet Union) formed in 1922. In 1938 this formation became the 32nd Cavalry Division.
Organisation 1941.
Regular Red Army cavalry divisions in 1941 had four cavalry regiments, a horse artillery battalion (eight 76mm guns and eight 122mm howitzers), a tank regiment (64 BT-series tanks), an anti-aircraft battalion (eight 76mm anti-aircraft guns and two batteries of AA machine guns), a signals squadron, a field engineer squadron and other rear echelon support units and sections. 
A cavalry regiment, in turn, consisted of four sabre squadrons, a machine-gun squadron (16 heavy machine guns and four 82mm mortars), a regimental artillery battery (four 76mm and four 45mm of instrument), an anti-aircraft battery (three 37mm guns and three quadrupled Maxim machine guns). 
The total authorized strength of a cavalry division included 8,968 personnel and 7,625 horses, the cavalry regiment respectively had 1,428 personnel and 1,506 horses. By 1943, a cavalry division was authorized 6,000 men and often organized into corps of three divisions that were reinforced by artillery, tank, and assault gun elements.
The cavalry corps were of two-divisional composition and approximately corresponded to a motorised division, possessing somewhat less mobility and lesser weight of artillery volley. 
At the commencement of the Second World War there were thirteen cavalry divisions (nine regular and four mountain) in the Red Army, mostly concentrated in four cavalry corps. Their dispositions in June 1941 were:
The rapid destruction of Soviet mechanized forces in the summer and autumn of 1941 resulted in a rapid expansion of cavalry units to provide the Red Army a mobile, if not armored, force. This expansion produced some 87 new cavalry divisions by early 1942, many of which were later disbanded as the Red Army rebuilt its tank and mechanized formations. 17 of the cavalry divisions were granted Guards status and renumbered accordingly.

Macintosh

The Macintosh ( ), marketed as Mac, is a line of personal computers (PCs) designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It was initially targeted mainly at the home, education, and creative professional markets. Since the introduction of the Macintosh, the computer has seen significant evolution now making it one of, if not the most powerful general purpose computers on the market. It now targets the business, science, and law markets as well. 
Steve Jobs introduced the Macintosh 128K on January 24, 1984. This was the first mass-market personal computer featuring a graphical user interface and mouse. The 128 was followed by numerous updated models also based on the Motorola 68000 family processors, producing a family of products in the Macintosh lineup. Although the aggressively priced IBM Personal Computer soon overtook Apple in sales, Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer until 1994 when it was overtaken by Compaq.
In the 1990s, improvements in the rival Wintel platform, notably with the introduction of Windows 3.0, gradually took market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. The performance advantage of 68000-based Macintosh systems was eroded by Intel's Pentium. Despite a transition to the PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in 1994, the falling prices of PC components and the release of Windows 95 saw the Macintosh user base decline. In 1998, Apple consolidated its multiple consumer-level desktop models into the all-in-one iMac G3, which became a commercial success and revitalized the brand. Since their transition to Intel processors in 2006, the complete lineup is entirely based on said processors and associated systems. Its current lineup comprises three desktops (the all-in-one iMac, entry-level Mac mini, and the Mac Pro tower graphics workstation), and three laptops (the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro MacBook Pro With Retina). Its Xserve server was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.
Production of the Mac is based on a vertical integration model. Apple facilitates all aspects of its hardware and creates its own operating system that is pre-installed on all Mac computers, unlike most IBM PC compatibles, where multiple sellers create and integrate hardware intended to run another company's operating software. Apple exclusively produces Mac hardware, choosing internal systems, designs, and prices. Apple also develops the operating system for the Mac, currently OS X version 10.9 "Mavericks". Macs are currently capable of running non-Apple operating systems such as Linux, OpenBSD, and Microsoft Windows with the aid of Boot Camp or third-party software. Apple does not license OS X for use on non-Apple computers, though it did license previous versions of Mac OS through their Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997.
History.
Development and introduction.
The Macintosh project began in 1979 with Jef Raskin, an Apple employee who envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh, but the name had to be changed for legal reasons as it was too close, phonetically, to that of the McIntosh audio equipment manufacturer. Steve Jobs requested a release of the name so that Apple could use it, but was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name. Apple stated the spelling changed after early users misspelled "McIntosh". Raskin was authorized to start hiring for the project in September 1979, and he began to look for an engineer who could put together a prototype. Bill Atkinson, a member of Apple's Lisa team (which was developing a similar higher-end computer,) introduced him to Burrell Smith, a self-taught engineer who worked as a service technician and had been hired earlier that year. Over the years, Raskin assembled a large development team that designed and built the original Macintosh hardware and the original version of the Mac OS operating system that the computer ran. Besides Raskin, Atkinson and Smith, the team included George Crow, Chris Espinosa, Joanna Hoffman, Bruce Horn, Susan Kare, Andy Hertzfeld, Guy Kawasaki, Daniel Kottke, and Jerry Manock.
Smith's first Macintosh board was built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64 kilobytes (kB) of RAM, used the Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of supporting a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display. Bud Tribble, a member of the Mac team, was interested in running the Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa's Motorola 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but increased its speed from 5 MHz to 8 MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64 kB of ROM – far more than most other computers; it had 128 kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64 kilobit (kb) RAM chips soldered to the logicboard. Though there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512 kB by means of soldering sixteen IC sockets to accept 256 kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's screen was a 9-inch, 512x342 pixel monochrome display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.
Burrel's innovative design, which combined the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa's CPU, the Motorola 68K, set off shock waves within Apple, capturing the attention of Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple. Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs' ideas than Raskin's. After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC, Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at Xerox PARC and were combined with the Macintosh group's own ideas. Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the "Snow White" design language; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers. However, Jobs' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last; after an internal power struggle with new CEO John Sculley, Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985. He went on to found NeXT, another computer company targeting the education market, and did not return until 1997, when Apple acquired NeXT. The Macintosh 128K was manufactured at an Apple plant in Fremont, California.
The Macintosh 128K was announced to the press in October 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December. The Macintosh was introduced by the now-famous US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, "1984". It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and is now considered a "watershed event" and a "masterpiece." "1984" used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the "conformity" of IBM's attempts to dominate the computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel, "Nineteen Eighty-Four", which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised "Big Brother."
Two days after "1984" aired, the Macintosh went on sale, and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: MacWrite and MacPaint. It was first demonstrated by Steve Jobs in the first of his famous Mac keynote speeches, and though the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, some labeled it a mere "toy." Because the operating system was designed largely around the GUI, existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten. This was a time-consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake, and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984, Microsoft's MultiPlan migrated over from MS-DOS, with Microsoft Word following in January 1985. In 1985, Lotus Software introduced Lotus Jazz for the Macintosh platform after the success of Lotus 1-2-3 for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop. Apple introduced the Macintosh Office suite the same year with the "Lemmings" ad. Infamous for insulting its own potential customers, the ad was not successful.
Apple spent upwards of $2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special, post-election issue of "Newsweek" Apple also ran a "Test Drive a Macintosh" promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US$1,995 to US$2,495 (about $5,200 when adjusted for inflation in 2010).
Desktop publishing.
In 1985, the combination of the Mac, Apple's LaserWriter printer, and Mac-specific software like Boston Software's MacPublisher and Aldus PageMaker enabled users to design, preview, and print page layouts complete with text and graphics—an activity to become known as desktop publishing. Initially, desktop publishing was unique to the Macintosh, but eventually became available for other platforms. Later, applications such as Macromedia FreeHand, QuarkXPress, and Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator strengthened the Mac's position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging desktop publishing market.
The Macintosh's minimal memory became apparent, even compared with other personal computers in 1984, and could not be expanded easily. It also lacked a hard disk drive or the means to easily attach one. Many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue. Suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to 512 KB or removing the computer's 16 memory chips and replacing them with larger-capacity chips, a tedious operation that was not always successful. In October 1985, Apple introduced the Macintosh 512K, with quadruple the memory of the original, at a price of US$3,195. It also offered an upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing the logicboard. In an attempt to improve connectivity, Apple released the Macintosh Plus on January 10, 1986, for a price of US$2,600. It offered one megabyte of RAM, easily expandable to four megabytes by the use of socketed RAM boards. It also featured a SCSI parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals—such as hard drives and scanners—to be attached to the machine. Its floppy drive was increased to an 800 kB capacity. The Mac Plus was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for just over four years and ten months, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history. In September 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or MPW, an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than cross compiling from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled HyperCard and MultiFinder, which added cooperative multitasking to the Macintosh. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.
Updated Motorola CPUs made a faster machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took advantage of the new Motorola technology and introduced the Macintosh II, powered by a Motorola 68020 processor. The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an open architecture with several NuBus expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud. One third-party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty. Later Macintosh computers had quieter power supplies and hard drives. The Macintosh SE was released at the same time as the Macintosh II, as the first compact Mac with a 20 MB internal hard drive and an expansion slot. The SE's expansion slot was located inside the case along with the CRT, potentially exposing an upgrader to high voltage. For this reason, Apple recommended users bring their SE to an authorized Apple dealer to have upgrades performed. The SE also updated Jerry Manock and Terry Oyama's original design and shared the Macintosh II's "Snow White" design language, as well as the new Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) mouse and keyboard that had first appeared on the Apple IIGS some months earlier.
In 1987, Apple spun off its software business as Claris. It was given the code and rights to several applications that had been written within Apple, most notably MacWrite, MacPaint, and MacProject. In the late 1980s, Claris released a number of revamped software titles; the result was the "Pro" series, including MacDraw Pro, MacWrite Pro, and FileMaker Pro. To provide a complete office suite, Claris purchased the rights to the Informix Wingz spreadsheet program on the Mac, renaming it Claris Resolve, and added the new presentation software Claris Impact. By the early 1990s, Claris applications were shipping with the majority of consumer-level Macintoshes and were extremely popular. In 1991, Claris released ClarisWorks, which soon became their second best-selling application. When Claris was reincorporated back into Apple in 1998, ClarisWorks was renamed AppleWorks beginning with version 5.0.
In 1988, Apple sued Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard on the grounds that they infringed Apple's copyrighted GUI, citing (among other things) the use of rectangular, overlapping, and resizable windows. After four years, the case was decided against Apple, as were later appeals. Apple's actions were criticized by some in the software community, including the Free Software Foundation (FSF), who felt Apple was trying to monopolize on GUIs in general, and boycotted GNU software for the Macintosh platform for seven years.
With the new Motorola 68030 processor came the Macintosh IIx in 1988, which had benefited from internal improvements, including an on-board MMU. It was followed in 1989 by the Macintosh IIcx, a more compact version with fewer slots and a version of the Mac SE powered by the 68030, the Macintosh SE/30. Later that year, the Macintosh IIci, running at , was the first Mac to be "32-bit clean." This allowed it to natively support more than 8 MB of RAM, unlike its predecessors, which had "32-bit dirty" ROMs (8 of the 32 bits available for addressing were used for OS-level flags). System 7 was the first Macintosh operating system to support 32-bit addressing.
The following year, the Macintosh IIfx, starting at US$9,900, was unveiled. Apart from its fast 68030 processor, it had significant internal architectural improvements, including faster memory and two Apple II CPUs (6502s) dedicated to I/O processing.
Decline.
Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990, and according to a common saying at the time "Windows was not as good as Macintosh, but it was good enough for the average user". Though still a graphical wrapper that relied upon MS-DOS, 3.0 was the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the much more expensive Macintosh platform. It also did not help matters that during the previous year Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers. Finally, there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry in 1989, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple's margins.
In response, Apple introduced a range of relatively inexpensive Macs in October 1990. The Macintosh Classic, essentially a less expensive version of the Macintosh SE, was the least expensive Mac offered until early 2001. The 68020-powered Macintosh LC, in its distinctive "pizza box" case, offered color graphics and was accompanied by a new, low-cost 512×384 pixel monitor. The Macintosh IIsi was essentially a IIci with only one expansion slot. All three machines sold well, although Apple's profit margin on them was considerably lower than that on earlier models.
Apple improved Macintosh computers by introducing models equipped with newly available processors from the 68k lineup. The Macintosh Classic II and Macintosh LC II, which used a 68030 CPU, were joined in 1991 by the Macintosh Quadra 700 and 900, the first Macs to employ the faster Motorola 68040 processor.
It wasn't long until Apple released their first portable computers, 
beginning with the Macintosh Portable released in 1990. Although due to considerable design issues, it was soon replaced in 1991 with the first of the PowerBook line: the PowerBook 100, a miniaturized Portable; the 68030 PowerBook 140; and the 68030 PowerBook 170. They were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest and a built-in pointing device (a trackball) in front of the keyboard. The 1993 PowerBook 165c was Apple's first portable computer to feature a color screen, displaying 256 colors with -pixel resolution. The second generation of PowerBooks, the 68040-equipped 500 series, introduced trackpads, integrated stereo speakers, and built-in Ethernet to the laptop form factor in 1994.
As for Mac OS, System 7 was a 32-bit rewrite from Pascal to C++ that introduced virtual memory and improved the handling of color graphics, as well as memory addressing, networking, and co-operative multitasking. Also during this time, the Macintosh began to shed the "Snow White" design language, along with the expensive consulting fees they were paying to Frogdesign. Apple instead brought the design work in-house by establishing the Apple Industrial Design Group, becoming responsible for crafting a new look for all Apple products.
Transition to PowerPC.
Intel had tried unsuccessfully to push Apple to migrate the Macintosh platform to Intel chips. Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. Apple's product design and engineering didn't help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series, several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops hit the market which cost Apple considerable sales. In 1993 Intel rolled out the Pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology. In 1994, Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the RISC PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola. The Power Macintosh line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months. However in the long run, spurning Intel for the PowerPC was a mistake as the commoditization of Intel-architecture chips meant Apple couldn't compete on price against "the Dells of the world".
Despite these technical and commercial successes on the Macintosh, the falling costs of components made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption, over Macintosh systems that remained fairly expensive. A successful price war initiated by Compaq vaulted them from third place to first among PC manufacturers in 1994, overtaking a struggling IBM and relegating Apple to third place.
Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers. At one point, its product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, Performa, and Centris models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names. These models competed against Macintosh clones, hardware manufactured by third-parties that ran Apple's System 7. This succeeded in increasing the Macintosh's market share somewhat, and provided cheaper hardware for consumers, but hurt Apple financially as existing Apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of Apple's higher-margin Macintosh systems, yet Apple still shouldered the burden of developing the Mac OS platform.
Apple's market share further struggled due to the release of the Windows 95 operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of IBM PC compatible computers, and brought the capabilities of Windows to parity with the Mac OS GUI.
When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 following the company's purchase of NeXT, he ordered that the OS that had been previewed as version 7.7 be branded Mac OS 8 (in place of the never-to-appear Copland OS). Since Apple had licensed only System 7 to third-parties, this move effectively ended the clone line. The decision caused significant financial losses for companies like Motorola, who produced the StarMax; Umax, who produced the SuperMac; and Power Computing, who offered several lines Mac clones, including the PowerWave, PowerTower, and PowerTower Pro. These companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own Mac-compatible hardware.
Apple bought out Power Computing's license, but allowed Umax to continue selling Mac clones until their license expired, as they had a sizeable presence in the lower-end segment that Apple did not.
Revival.
In 1998, Apple introduced its new iMac which, like the original 128K Mac, was an all-in-one computer. Its translucent plastic case, originally Bondi blue and later various additional colors, is considered an industrial design landmark of the late 1990s. The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as SCSI and ADB, in favor of two USB ports. It replaced a floppy disk drive with a CD-ROM drive for installing software, but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 139 days. It made the company an annual profit of US$309 million, Apple's first profitable year since Michael Spindler took over as CEO in 1995. This aesthetic was applied to the Power Macintosh and later the iBook, Apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of Apple's "four-square product matrix" ("desktop" and "portable" products for both "consumers" and "professionals"). More than 140,000 pre-orders were placed before it started shipping in September, and by October proved to be a large success.
In early 2001, Apple began shipping computers with CD-RW drives and emphasized the Mac's ability to play DVDs by including DVD-ROM and DVD-RAM drives as standard. Steve Jobs admitted that Apple had been "late to the party" on writable CD technology, but felt that Macs could become a "digital hub" that linked and enabled an "emerging digital lifestyle". Apple would later introduce an update to its iTunes music player software that enabled it to burn CDs, along with a controversial "Rip, Mix, Burn" advertising campaign that some felt encouraged media piracy. This accompanied the release of the iPod, Apple's first successful handheld device. Apple continued to launch products, such as the unsuccessful Power Mac G4 Cube, the education-oriented eMac, and the titanium (and later aluminium) PowerBook G4 laptop for professionals.
The original iMac used a PowerPC G3 processor, but G4 and G5 chips were soon added, both accompanied by complete case redesigns that dropped the array of colors in favor of white plastic. As of 2007, all iMacs use aluminium cases. On January 11, 2005, Apple announced the Mac Mini, priced at US$499, making it the cheapest Mac.
Mac OS continued to evolve up to version 9.2.2, including retrofits such as the addition of a nanokernel and support for Multiprocessing Services 2.0 in Mac OS 8.6, though its dated architecture made replacement necessary. Initially developed in the Pascal programming language, it was substantially rewritten in C++ for System 7. From its beginnings on an 8 MHz machine with 128 KB of RAM, it had grown to support Apple's latest 1 GHz G4-equipped Macs. Since its architecture was laid down, features that were already common on Apple's competition, like preemptive multitasking and protected memory, had become feasible on the kind of hardware Apple manufactured. As such, Apple introduced Mac OS X, a fully overhauled Unix-based successor to Mac OS 9. OS X uses Darwin, XNU, and Mach as foundations, and is based on NeXTSTEP. It was released to the public in September 2000, as the Mac OS X Public Beta, featuring a revamped user interface called "Aqua". At US$29.99, it allowed adventurous Mac users to sample Apple's new operating system and provide feedback for the actual release. The initial version of Mac OS X, 10.0 "Cheetah", was released on March 24, 2001. Older Mac OS applications could still run under early Mac OS X versions, using an environment called "Classic". Subsequent releases of Mac OS X included 10.1 "Puma" (September 25, 2001), 10.2 "Jaguar" (August 24, 2002), 10.3 "Panther" (October 24, 2003) and 10.4 "Tiger" (April 29, 2005).
Transition to Intel x86.
Apple discontinued the use of PowerPC microprocessors in 2006. At WWDC 2005, Steve Jobs announced this transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and PowerPC architectures. All new Macs now use x86 processors made by Intel, and some were renamed as a result. Intel-based Macs running OS X 10.6 and below (support has been discontinued since 10.7) can run pre-existing software developed for PowerPC using an emulator called Rosetta, although at noticeably slower speeds than native programs. The Classic environment is unavailable on the Intel architecture, though. Intel chips introduced the potential to run the Microsoft Windows operating system natively on Apple hardware, without emulation software such as Virtual PC. In March 2006, a group of hackers announced that they were able to run Windows XP on an Intel-based Mac. The group released their software as open source and has posted it for download on their website. On April 5, 2006, Apple announced the availability of the public beta of Boot Camp, software that allows owners of Intel-based Macs to install Windows XP on their machines; later versions added support for Windows Vista and Windows 7. Classic was discontinued in Mac OS X 10.5, and Boot Camp became a standard feature on Intel-based Macs.
Starting in 2006, Apple's industrial design shifted to favor aluminum, which was used in the construction of the first MacBook Pro. Glass was added in 2008 with the introduction of the unibody MacBook Pro. These materials are billed as environmentally friendly. The iMac, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini lines currently all use aluminum enclosures, and are now made of a single unibody. Chief designer Jonathan Ive continues to guide products towards a minimalist and simple feel, including eliminating of replaceable batteries in notebooks. Multi-touch gestures from the iPhone's interface have been applied to the Mac line in the form of touch pads on notebooks and the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad for desktops.
On February 24, 2011, Apple became the first company to bring to market a computer that utilized Intel's new Thunderbolt (codename Light Peak) I/O interface. Using the same physical interface as a Mini DisplayPort, and backwards compatible with that standard, Thunderbolt boasts two-way transfer speeds of 10 Gbit/s.
Hardware.
Apple directly sub-contracts hardware production to Asian original equipment manufacturers such as Asus, maintaining a high degree of control over the end product. By contrast, most other companies (including Microsoft) create software that can be run on hardware produced by a variety of third-parties such as Dell, HP/Compaq, and Lenovo. Consequently, the Macintosh buyer has comparably fewer options.
The current Mac product family uses Intel x86-64 processors. Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), much as it did during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 2 GB of RAM as standard. Current Mac computers use ATI Radeon or nVidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro with Retina Display) ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and FireWire (except for the MacBook Air, which does not include FireWire). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the "Thunderbolt" port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.
Apple was initially reluctant to embrace mice with multiple buttons and scroll wheels. Macs did not natively support pointing devices that featured multiple buttons, even from third parties, until Mac OS X arrived in 2001. Apple continued to offer only single button mice, in both wired and Bluetooth wireless versions, until August 2005, when it introduced the Mighty Mouse. While it looked like a traditional one-button mouse, it actually had four buttons and a scroll ball, capable of independent "x"- and "y"-axis movement. A Bluetooth version followed in July 2006. In October 2009, Apple introduced the Magic Mouse, which uses multi-touch gesture recognition (similar to that of the iPhone) instead of a physical scroll wheel or ball. It is available only in a wireless configuration, but the wired Mighty Mouse (re-branded as "Apple Mouse") is still available as an alternative. Since 2010, Apple has also offered the Magic Trackpad as a means to control Macintosh desktop computers in a way similar to laptops.
Software.
The original Macintosh was the first successful personal computer to use a graphical user interface devoid of a command line. It used a desktop metaphor, depicting real-world objects like documents and a trashcan as icons onscreen. The "System" software was introduced in 1984 with the first Macintosh and renamed "Mac OS" in 1997. It continued to evolve until version 9.2.2. In 2001, Apple introduced Mac OS X, based on Darwin and NEXTSTEP; its new features included the Dock and the Aqua user interface. During the transition, Apple included an emulator known as Classic, allowing users to run Mac OS 9 applications under Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier on PowerPC machines. The most recent version is Mac OS X v10.9 "Mavericks." In addition to Mavericks, all new Macs are bundled with assorted Apple-produced applications, including iLife, the Safari web browser and the iTunes media player. Apple Introduced Mavericks at WWDC 2013 in June, and release it on October 15 of that year for FREE to everyone running SnowLeopard or later and is compatible with most Macs from 2007 and earlier. Mavericks brought a lot of the iOS apps, functions, and feel to the Mac as well as better multi display support, iBooks, Maps, app nap, and other upgrades to improve performance and battery life. Apple introduced Mac OS X 10.8 in February, and it was made available in the summer of 2012. Mountain Lion includes many new features, such as Mission Control, the Mac App Store (available to Mac OS X v10.6.6 "Snow Leopard." users by software update), Launchpad, an application viewer and launcher akin to the iOS Home Screen, and Resume, a feature similar to the hibernate function found in Microsoft Windows.
Historically, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that affect Microsoft Windows users. Mac OS X has a smaller usage share compared to Microsoft Windows (roughly 5% and 92%, respectively), but it also has secure UNIX roots. Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities were noted in February 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware. Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks. Apple releases security updates for its software. In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks, and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions were able to install without user input. Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem. An estimated 100,000 users were affected.
Originally, the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the Mac OS operating system that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system. The most common workaround, used even by Apple for A/UX, was to boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a program that took over the system and acted as a bootloader. This technique was no longer necessary with the introduction of Open Firmware-based PCI Macs, though it was formerly used for convenience on many Old World ROM systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation. Now, Mac hardware boots directly from Open Firmware (most PowerPC-based Macs) or EFI (all Intel-based Macs), and Macs are no longer limited to running just Mac OS X.
Following the release of Intel-based Macs, third-party platform virtualization software such as Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion, and VirtualBox began to emerge. These programs allow users to run Microsoft Windows or previously Windows-only software on Macs at near native speed. Apple also released Boot Camp and Mac-specific Windows drivers that help users to install Windows XP or Vista and natively dual boot between Mac OS X and Windows. Though not condoned by Apple, it is possible to run the Linux operating system using Boot camp or other virtualization workarounds.
Because Mac OS X is a UNIX-like operating system, borrowing heavily from FreeBSD, many applications written for Linux or BSD run on Mac OS X, often using X11. Apple's smaller market share than Microsoft's means that a smaller range of shareware is available, but many popular commercial software applications from large developers, such as Microsoft's Office and Adobe's Photoshop are ported to both Mac OS and Windows. A large amount of open-source software applications, like the Firefox web browser and the OpenOffice.org office suite, are cross-platform, and thereby also run natively on the Mac.
Mr. Macintosh.
Early in the development of Macintosh, Steve Jobs wanted to add "a mysterious character" to the first OS, according to an early developer from the 80's, Andy Hertzfeld. Mr. Macintosh is a mysterious little man who lives inside each Macintosh. He pops up every once in a while, when you least expect it, and then winks at you and disappears again. It will be so quick that you won’t be sure if you saw him or not… One out of every thousand or two times that you pull down a menu, instead of the normal commands, you’ll get Mr. Macintosh, leaning against the wall of the menu. He’ll wave at you, then quickly disappear. You’ll try to get him to come back, but you won’t be able to. Steve was really excited to get this mysterious character in the OS, so he hired Belgian cartoonist Jean-Michel Folon. Mr. Macintosh was intended to mysteriously appear every "One thousand times or so a person used an OS UI element such as the menu bar." Code for Mr. Macintosh is named "MrMacHook" and exists in the first version of Mac OS. Animations were never made for Mr. Macintosh because the character was scrapped from the OS, as the images were too large to fit in the available storage space.
Advertising.
Apple hyped the introduction of the original Mac with their "1984" commercial that aired during that year's Super Bowl. It was supplemented by a number of printed pamphlets and other TV ads demonstrating the new interface and emphasizing the mouse. Many more brochures for new models like the Macintosh Plus and the Performa followed. In the 1990s, Apple started the "What's on your PowerBook?" campaign, with print ads and television commercials featuring celebrities describing how the PowerBook helps them in their businesses and everyday lives. In 1995, Apple responded to the introduction of Windows 95 with several print ads and a television commercial demonstrating its disadvantages and lack of innovation. In 1997, the Think Different campaign introduced Apple's new slogan, and in 2002 the Switch campaign followed. The most recent advertising strategy for the Macintosh by Apple is the Get a Mac campaign, with North American, UK, and Japanese variants. Since 2011, while Apple has concentrated its advertising on the iPhone and iPad, many of these ads show how users can seamlessly sync data between these devices and Macs through iCloud.
Apple introduces new products at "special events" hosted at the Apple Town Hall auditorium, and at keynotes at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. Formerly, it also announced new products at trade shows like the Apple Expo and the Macworld Expo. The events typically draw a large gathering of media representatives and spectators, and are preceded by speculation about possible new products. In the past, special events have been used to unveil Apple's desktop and notebook computers, such as the iMac and MacBook, and other consumer electronic devices like the iPod, Apple TV, and iPhone. The keynotes as well as provide updates on sales and market share statistics. Apple has begun to focus its advertising on its retail stores instead of these trade shows; the company's last Macworld keynote was in 2009.
Market share and user demographics.
Since the introduction of the Macintosh, Apple has struggled to gain a significant share of the personal computer market. At first, the Macintosh 128K suffered from a dearth of available software compared to IBM's PC, resulting in disappointing sales in 1984 and 1985. It took 74 days for 50,000 units to sell. Although the aggressively priced IBM PC soon overtook Apple in sales, Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer until 1994, when it was overtaken by Compaq who had previously held the third place spot during the 1980s and early 1990s.
In recent years, market share of the personal computer market is measured by browser hits, sales and installed base. If using the browser metric, Mac market share has increased substantially in 2007. If measuring market share by installed base, there were more than 20 million Mac users by 1997, compared to an installed base of around 340 million Windows PCs. Statistics from late 2003 indicate that Apple had 2.06 percent of the desktop share in the United States that had increased to 2.88 percent by Q4 2004. As of October 2006, research firms IDC and Gartner reported that Apple's market share in the U.S. had increased to about 6 percent. Figures from December 2006, showing a market share around 6 percent (IDC) and 6.1 percent (Gartner) are based on a more than 30 percent increase in unit sale from 2005 to 2006. The installed base of Mac computers is hard to determine, with numbers ranging from 5% (estimated in 2009) to 16% (estimated in 2005). Mac OS X's share of the OS market increased from 7.31% in December 2007 to 9.63% in December 2008, which is a 32% increase in market share during 2008, compared with a 22% increase during 2007.
By March 2011, OS X market share in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.
In recent years, Apple has seen a significant boost in sales of Macs. This has been attributed, in part, to the success of the iPod and the iPhone, a halo effect whereby satisfied iPod or iPhone owners purchase more Apple products, and Apple has since capitalized on that with the iCloud cloud service that allows users to seamlessly sync data between these devices and Macs. The use of Intel microprocessors has helped Macs more directly compete with their Windows counterparts on price and performance, and by the 2010s Apple was receiving Intel's latest CPUs first before other PC manufacturers. From 2001 to 2008, Mac sales increased continuously on an annual basis. Apple reported worldwide sales of 3.36 million Macs during the 2009 holiday season. As of Mid-2011, the Macintosh continues to enjoy rapid market share increase in the US, growing from 7.3% of all computer shipments in 2010 to 9.3% in 2011. Apple has generally dominates the premium PC market, in 2009 having a 91 percent market share for PCs priced at more than $1,000, according to NPD.
Like other personal computer manufacturers, the Macintosh lines have been hurt by consumer trend towards smartphones and tablet computers (particularly Apple's own iPhone and iPad, respectively) as the computing devices of choice among consumers. However, Apple still managed to ship 2.8 million MacBooks in Q2 2012 (the majority of which are the MacBook Air) compared to 500,000 total Ultrabooks, despite there being dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11-inch and 13-inch models of the Macbook Air. The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States.
While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to "OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction". Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, despite being one of the higher-priced competitors, however many Ultrabooks with better features often held an expensive premium over the MacBook Air.
According to a 2013 Gartner report, which doesn't distinguish between computers, tablet computers, mobile phones and portable music players, Apple devices (Mac & iOS combined) are expected to outsell all Windows devices for the first time in 2013.

The Lacemaker

The Lacemaker () is a 1977 French drama film directed by Claude Goretta and starring Isabelle Huppert. It is based on the 1974 Prix Goncourt winning novel "La Dentellière" by Pascal Lainé. 
Plot.
In Paris, the shy and virginal Béatrice lives with her mother and works in a hairdressing salon, where her only friend is the lively Marylène. Left by her lover, Marylène suggests that the two girls take a holiday by the sea at Cabourg. There Marylène soon goes off with a new man, leaving Béatrice on her own. 
Befriended by the shy student François, the two become lovers and Béatrice moves into his room in Paris. Though he introduces her to his well-off parents and his intellectual friends, she is unable to mix in their worlds. Her deep reserve begins to annoy him and they split up. Losing interest in life, she ends up in a mental hospital. 
Full of remorse, François visits her but she wants nothing: she has found a quiet place that suits her inwardness. In her silent anonymity, she is like the unknown girls in paintings such as the Lacemaker.

Legal certainty

Legal certainty is a principle in national and international law which holds that the law must provide those subject to it with the ability to regulate their conduct. Legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the rule of law.
Definition.
The legal system needs to permit those subject to the law to regulate their conduct with certainty and to protect those subject to the law from arbitrary use of state power. Legal certainty represents a requirement that decisions be made according to legal rules, i.e. be lawful. The concept of legal certainty may be strongly linked to that of individual autonomy in national jurisprudence. The degree to which the concept of legal certainty is incorporated into law varies depending on national jurisprudence. However, legal certainty frequently serves as the central principle for the development of legal methods by which law is made, interpreted and applied.
Legal certainty is an established legal concept both in the civil law legal systems and common law legal systems. In the civil law tradition, legal certainty is defined in terms of maximum predictability of officials' behaviour. In the common law tradition, legal certainty is often explained in terms of citizens' ability to organise their affairs in such a way that does not break the law. In both legal traditions, legal certainty is regarded as grounding value for the legality of legislative and administrative measures taken by public authorities.
Rule of law.
The legal philosopher Gustav Radbruch regarded legal certainty, justice and policy as the three fundamental pillars of law. Today legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the rule of law. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) the concept of the rule of law "first and foremost seeks to emphasize the necessity of establishing a rule-based society in the interest of legal certainty and predictability." At the G8 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Potsdam in 2007, the G8 committed to the rule of law as a core principle entailing adherence to the principle of legal certainty.
Europe.
European nations regard legal certainty as a fundamental quality of the legal system and a guiding requirement for the rule of law. The concept can be traced through English common law and is recognised in all European legal systems. The concept is recognised in Germany as "Rechtssicherheit", in France as "sécurité juridique", in Spain as "seguridad juridica", in Italy as "certezza del diritto", in the Benelux countries as "rechtszekerheid", in Sweden as "Rättssäkerhet", in Poland as "pewność prawa", and in Finland as "oikeusvarmuuden periaate". Legal certainty is now recognised as one of the general principles of European community law and "requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person - if need be, with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail". The principle of legal certainty, and as such the rule of law, requires that:
General principle of European Union law.
The concept of legal certainty has been recognised as one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1960s. It is an important general principle of international law and public law, which predates European Union law. As a general principle in European Union law, it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, especially when applied to financial obligations. The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law.
In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits "Ex post facto" laws, i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The general principle also requires that sufficient information must be made public to enable parties to know what the law is and comply with it. For example in "Opel Austria v Council" ECR II-39 Case T-115/94 The European Court of Justice held that European Council Regulation did not come into effect until it had been published. Opel had brought the action on the basis that the Regulation in question violated the principle of legal certainty, because it legally came into effect before it had been notified and the regulation published. The doctrine of legitimate expectation, which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law.
The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that "those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is, or seems to be, should not be frustrated in their expectations". This means that a European Union institution, once it has induced a party to take a particular course of action, must not renege on its earlier position if doing so would cause that party to suffer loss. The European Court of Justice has considered the legitimate expectation doctrine in cases where violation of the general principle of legal certainty was alleged in numerous cases involving agricultural policy and European Council regulations, with the leading case being "Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij" ECR 2321 Case 120/86.
The misuse of power test is another significant element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. It holds that a lawful power must not be exercised for any other purpose than that for which it was conferred. According to the misuse of power test a decision by a European Union institution is only a misuse of power if "it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been adopted with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving any end other than those stated." A rare instance where the European Court of Justice has held that a European Union institution has misused its powers, and therefore violated the general principle of legal uncertainty, is "Giuffrida v Commission" ECR 1395 Case 105/75. The general principle of legal certainty is particularly stringently applied when European Union law imposes financial burdens on private parties.
European human rights law.
The concept of legal certainty is recognised by the European Court of Human Rights.
US.
In US law the principle of legal certainty is phrased as fair warning and the void for vagueness principle.
However, in the "Calder v. Bull" case it was established that in the U.S. the prohibition of ex post facto laws applies only to criminal cases, not to civil law.

Tinsley, South Yorkshire

Tinsley is a suburb of northeastern Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.
The name "Tinsley" is also associated with the nearby former Tinsley Marshalling Yard and the Tinsley Viaduct, which carries the M1 motorway across the Don valley.
History.
The name of the suburb derives from the Old English "Tingas-Leah", which means 'Field of Council', cognate with "thing (assembly)" and "lea", a dialectal word for "meadow". It is mentioned as 'Tirneslawe' or 'Tineslawe' in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was in the possession of Roger de Busli.
The chapel of St Laurence, Tinsley was built in 1877 on the site of an ancient (possibly of Anglo-Saxon origin) chapel. An annual royal payment was received until 1847 in order that a service for the dead could be held.
Another tradition associated with the settlement required the Lord of the Manor of Tinsley to take a pair of white gloves to the Lord of Tickhill each year at Michaelmas, and receive in return a white dove to keep over winter.
Tinsley Wood lay to the south of the settlement, on land now partly occupied by Sheffield City Airport and High Hazels Park. It may have been the site of the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, where Athelstan of Wessex gained the submission of the Celtic monarchs of Norse-Ireland & around Britain. In the mediaeval period, it was associated with outlaws, one named as "Roger de Presteman, an outlawe of Tyneslawe".
The area became industrialised from 1732, when the River Don Navigation was extended to terminate in the village. A turnpike road was constructed to Sheffield. In 1819, the Sheffield Canal was opened, running from Tinsley to Sheffield. The area became major industrial centre known for its collieries, iron, steel, and wire works.
Companies such as George Cohen, the '600 works', Osbourn Hadfield and Brinsworth Strip Mills were occupants of the landscape near Tinsley and the neighbouring district of Templeborough. Only the BOC plant and Brinsworth Strip Mills remain within the village boundaries. All the remaining works were either demolished or preserved as a museum to what was the heart of Sheffield industry until 1985.
Facilities and attractions.
Replacing the steelworks on Vulcan Road is the Meadowhall shopping centre.
In the centre of Tinsley is the Tinsley Recreation ground (sometimes referred to as "the Rec"). Recently, part of this has been claimed as a community centre called Tinsley Green. It has a new 5-aside football pitch, Tennis court, children's playground, adult rides and a cricket bowling practice area.

Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent

The Church of St Mary Magadalene, Newark-on-Trent is a parish church in the Church of England in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire.
The church is Grade I listed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest.
Buildings.
It is notable for the tower and the octagonal spire (236 ft. high), the highest in Nottinghamshire. The central piers remain from the previous church, dating from the 11th or 12th century. The upper parts of the tower and spire were completed about 1350; the nave dates from between 1384 and 1393, and the chancel from 1489.
The sanctuary is bounded on the south and north by two chantry chapels, the former of which has on one of its panels a remarkable painting from the Dance of Death. There are a few old monuments, and an exceedingly fine brass of the 14th century. There is a hole in the spire which was supposedly made by a musket ball during the Civil War, although there is doubt locally as to the truth of the story. This hole is visible from some parts of the town centre.
It was heavily restored in the mid nineteenth century by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The reredos was added by Sir Ninian Comper.
The Magnus Bequest.
The church is supported by the Magnus Bequest, a charitable foundation created in the early 1530s by Thomas Magnus, who gave farms and lands in south Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire for a fourfold purpose:
Music.
Organ.
At the beginning of the 19th century a new organ by George Pike England of 3 manuals was provided by the trustees of the Magnus, Brown’s and Phyllypott’s charities at a cost of £1300. It was opened on 11 November 1804 by Thomas Spofforth.
It was placed on the west gallery from where the choir sang services. In 1814 the organ was re-located on the chancel screen and the choir returned to the chancel. In the 1850s, the organ was rebuilt by Forster and Andrews of Hull, provided with a new case and again re-located, this time to its present position in the south choir aisle. 
In 1866 the organ was rebuilt and enlarged by Henry Willis. Willis virtually doubled the size of the instrument and its case, creating a large Romantic four-manual organ. The organ was again rebuilt by William Hill & Sons in 1910 at the expense of Mrs Becher Tidd Pratt and family, and subsequently by Hill, Norman and Beard in 1924, 1938, 1964 and 1978 when it was rebuilt and more voices added.
It is now electrically operated by the Ellen Dynamic Transmission system which allows much greater mobility of the organ console, providing more direct contact with the congregation and the choir; it is the first four-manual instrument in the country to be so equipped, enabling a live performance to be electronically recorded and replayed automatically.
The Choir.
The Choral Foundation was set up by Thomas Magnus in 1532 and was said to be the only existing pre-reformation choir outside cathedrals and Oxbridge colleges. Girl choristers were admitted into the main choir from 2008.
, when choral services stopped following the dismissal of the Master of the Song School, the choir comprised two head choristers (one boy and one girl), four senior choristers, several full choristers and a number of probationers, together with adult songmen who sang alto, tenor and bass parts. 
Masters of the Song School.
The organist of the church is still known by the old title Master of the Song School. There have been appointments since at least 1532.

Pertti Jalava

Pertti Jalava (born 1960 in Turku, Finland) composed numerous works for various chamber ensembles choral groups and orchestra, including three symphonies and a piano concerto. He wrote music for jazz and big band line-ups. Stylistically he keeps these genres separate, he does allow influences to travel between the two.
Career.
Jalava studied composition almost entirely on his own. In 1993, having already created an extensive repertoire influenced by jazz and classical music for his jazz ensembles, he studied theatre composition with the American Craig Bohmler on a six-month course run by the Finnish Music Theatre Association. As his final assignment he composed a chamber opera called Paradise. Having completed this course, a turning point in his career, Jalava embarked on an intensive course of private study and attended composition laboratories held by the Turku Philharmonic Orchestra and the University of Turku in 1994, 1996 and 1998.
Pertti Jalava won a number of prizes in Finnish and international composition competitions with works for string orchestra, wind orchestra, chamber ensemble, jazz ensemble and big band. Works by him have been performed by many orchestras and ensembles in Finland and abroad. He has been a full-time composer since 2001.
A Finnish record label Alba released "In The Wind" with four of Jalava's works for string orchestra and soloists (piano and flute) to positive reviews.
Themes.
Jalava lists his primary objectives as emotional and narrative expression. He uses strong contrasts, thereby achieving dramatic effects and aesthetic accents. He uses distorted harmonies, sharp timbres and aggressive rhythms. Rhythm occupies a major role in Jalava's music. It is often motor-like and frequently asymmetric.
Despite drawing mainly on twelve-note techniques, most of Jalava's classical works create a feeling of tonality. In his later compositions he often lets their nature determine the music or employs other methods of his own devising, assigning row technique only a secondary role.

Polina Misailidou

Polina Paraskevi Misailidou () is a Greek singer, who is better known in her own country simply as Polina.
Polina was born and raised in Nea Smyrni, a suburb south of Athens. She started her career in 1977 singing the song "Lives" at the Thessaloniki Song Festival. In 1979, Polina appeared at the Eurovision Song Contest as a backup singer to Elpida as she performed the entry "Sokrati".
However, that would be her only time going to Eurovision. She was picked in the 1986 national selection to represent Greece at Eurovision Song Contest 1986 in Bergen, Norway, but Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi, Greece's national broadcaster, pulled out of the Contest unexpectedly. Polina stated that it was due to political troubles in Greece at the time, but she noted that a Eurovision website had learned that the real reason was that the Contest was to be held the night before Orthodox Easter. Had she performed, she would have appeared eighteenth and she would have performed the song "Wagon-lit".
She is best known for the string of chart successes she had in Greece in the late 1980s, including "Birimpa", "Push-Ups", "Let's Go to the Seychelles", and "Radio, Love Me". She has also collaborated with several well-known composers, particularly Stamatis Kraounakis, with whom she has had a working relationship since the release of her "Birimpa" album in 1986.

Michal Morey

Michal Morey was a woodcutter who lived at Sullens, near Downend on the Isle of Wight. He was executed in Winchester and gibbeted on the Isle of Wight in 1737 for the murder of his orphaned grandson, James Dove, who was in the care of Morey and his wife Beth. It is said that, in order to destroy evidence of Dove's murder, he burnt his cottage. The road is now known as "Burnthouse Lane" and the woods as "Burnthouse Woods".
Death of James Dove.
James Dove, aged 14, went missing shortly after coming into a small legacy and was last seen going to the woods with his grandfather. Michal Morey absconded for several days and a warrant was issued for his arrest.He was apprehended towards the end of July 1736 and held in Winchester awaiting trial.
Three months later, the dismembered and decomposed remains of James Dove were found in the woods. They were in two leather bags, together with a billhook and bloodied gloves. Identification was made from the victim's clothes.
Trial and execution.
Morey was tried at Winchester Assize in March 1737. The evidence was circumstantial. Morey, being inarticulate and taciturn by nature, pleaded not guilty and presented a poor defence. He was sentenced to death and hanged an hour after the trial at Winchester public gallows. His body was then taken to the scene of his crime and hung in chains from a gibbet erected in his home parish of Arreton.
The gibbet was built at a cost of six pounds and five shillings by local wheelwright, John Phillips. It was positioned on a Bronze Age barrow (since known as Michal Morey's Mound, or Hump) near a crossroad at the end of Burnthouse Lane.
Legacy.
The gibbet-post now forms a prominent roof beam, over 22 feet in length, in the original tap room of the nearby Hare and Hounds tavern, with the date 1737 carved on it. Beneath, in a glass box, is exhibited a skull said to have been unearthed in 1933 and formerly supposed to be that of Morey. Research has subsequently identified it as belonging to a Bronze Age woman who died in her late teens, as stated on an accompanying notice. 
The following rhyme was popular with local children for many years and is displayed, along with contemporary accounts painted in black letters, at intervals around the Hare And Hounds.

Wijnand Nuijen

Wijnand Jan Josephus Nuijen (4 March 1813 – 2 June 1839) was a Dutch painter and printmaker who specialised in landscapes, and was greatly influenced by the French Romantics.
Biography.
Born in Den Haag to a baker father who recognised his son's talent, Nuijen was apprenticed at age twelve to Andreas Schelfhout, a local artist. Between 1825 and 1829 he studied at the Den Haag Tekenacademie, under Bartholomeus Johannes van Hove. In his short lifespan Nuijen became a prolific painter of rural and marine landscapes, spending much time on the Normandy and northern French coasts. Here he fell under the spell of painters who were working in France, such as Richard Parkes Bonington (1802–1828) and Eugene Isabey (1803–1886), both of whom painted picturesque villages, Normandy harbours and seascapes, with a spontaneity Nuijen admired and adopted. His preoccupation with ruins is typically Romantic and his use of colour and texture is reminiscent of the watercolours of Turner.
The "Felix Meritis" society of Amsterdam awarded him a medal in 1829 for his watercolour of a forest landscape. On completion of his tuition he travelled to Belgium, France and Germany, at times with his painting companion Antonie Waldorp Nuijen became a member of the Koninklijke Akademie in Amsterdam in 1836, and just before his death he married the daughter of Schelfhout, his former tutor. Nuijen died in Den Haag on 2 June 1839.
Nuijen was unusual among Dutch painters of the period, his theatricality and liberal style contrasting with the near photographic depiction that was then the norm. King William II greatly admired Nuijen's work, and when he bought the ""Shipwreck"" in 1843 he already owned five other Nuijen paintings.

<doc id="19007372" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19007372" title="Laws of Eshnunna">
Laws of Eshnunna

The Laws of Eshnunna (abrv. LE) are inscribed on two cuneiform tablets discovered in Tell Abū Harmal, Baghdad, Iraq. The Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities headed by Taha Baqir unearthed two parallel sets of tablets in 1945 and 1947. The two tablets are separate copies of an older source and date back to ca. 1930 BC. The differences between the Code of Hammurabi and the Laws of Eshnunna significantly contributed to illuminating the development of ancient and cuneiform law. Eshnunna was north of Ur on the Tigris River and became politically important after the fall of the third dynasty of Ur, founded by Ur-Nammu. 
In distinction from the other Mesopotamian collections of law, this one got its name after the city where it had originated – Eshnunna, located on the bank of the Diyala River, tributary to the Tigris. This collection of laws is not a real systemized codex; nearly sixty of its sections are preserved. The Laws are written in Akkadian and consist of two tablets which are marked with A and B. In 1948, Albrecht Goetze of the Yale University had translated and published them. In some sources the Laws of Eshnunna are mentioned as the Laws of Bilalama due to the belief that the Eshnunnian ruler probably was their originator, but Goetze maintained that tablet B was originated under the reign of Dadusha. The text of the prologue is broken at the point where the ruler who promulgated the laws was specified.
Albrecht Goetze has noticed the specific style of expression. The laws were composed in a mode that facilitated memorizing. A distinguished Israeli scientist and one of the foremost experts on this collection of laws, Reuven Yaron of the University of Jerusalem concerning this matter stated: “What matters to me – and might have mattered to those who fashioned them almost 4000 years ago – is the ease of remembering the text.”
The conditional sentence (“If A then B” – as it also is the case with the other Mesopotamian laws) is an attribute of this codification. In 23 paragraphs, it appears in the form šumma awilum – “If a man…” After the disposition, a precise sanction follows, e.g. LU42(A): “If a man bit and severed the nose of a man, one mina silver he shall weigh out.”
The Laws clearly show signs of social stratification, mainly focussing on two different classes: the muškenum and awilum. The audience of the Laws of Eshnunna is more extensive than in the case of the earlier cuneiform codifications: awilum – free men and women (mar awilim and marat awilim), muškenum, wife (aššatum), son (maru), slaves of both sexes – male (wardum) and female (amtum) – which are not only objects of law as in classical slavery, and delicts where the victims were slaves have been sanctioned, and other class designations as ubarum, apþarum, mudum that are not ascertained.
Reuven Yaron has divided the offences of the Laws of Eshnunna into five groups. The articles of the first group had to be collected from all over the Laws and the articles of the other four were roughly ordered one after the other:
1. Theft and related offences,
2. False distraint,
3. Sexual offences,
4. Bodily injuries,
5. Damages caused by a goring ox and comparable cases.
The majority of these offences were penalized with pecuniary fines (an amount of silver), but some serious offences such as burglary, murder, and sexual offences were penalized with death. It seems that the capital punishment was avoidable (in contrast to the Code of Hammurabi), because of the standard formulation: “It is a case of life … he shall die”.

Landscape After the Battle

Landscape After the Battle () is a 1970 drama film directed by Andrzej Wajda and starring Daniel Olbrychski; telling a story of a Nazi German concentration camp survivor soon after liberation, residing in a DP camp somewhere in Germany. It is based on the writings of Holocaust survivor and Polish author Tadeusz Borowski. In most part, the plot revolves around the events depicted in Borowski's short story called "Bitwa pod Grunwaldem" ("The Battle of Grunwald") from his collection "This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen". The film was entered into the 1970 Cannes Film Festival.
Plot.
The "Landscape After the Battle" film tells a story of two young concentration camp survivors. A young Polish poet (Tadeusz) is asked by a pretty Jewish girl (Nina) to go with her to the West. His camp experience, however, prevents him from realizing the depth of her love for him, and he is reluctant to commit. The woman is accidentally shot dead by an American soldier, causing the poet to cry for the first time in years. The shock of her death brings back the world of feelings suppressed by his Nazi captors, and allows for his original creativity to reemerge.

Cathedral High School (Hamilton, Ontario)

Cathedral High School is an inner city public Roman Catholic high school in Hamilton, Ontario, under the jurisdiction of the Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board. Cathedral High School dates back to 1912, when high school classes where offered to the youth of Hamilton by the Hamilton Separate School Board. Classes were held in two rooms at St. Mary’s School, located on Mulberry Street. By 1921, enrollment had increased significantly and the two rooms could no longer hold the amount of people. The boys were soon moved to the upper floor of St. Patrick’s School on East Avenue and Main Street. While the girls remained at St. Mary’s. In 1925, the Separate School Board authorized the building of a new and larger building.
People of Catholic faith were asked to donate money to help build the new school by the Holy Name Men of various parishes. In 1928 Cathedral Boys’ High School was officially opened on Emerald and Main Street, where it still stands today. In the same year the Girls’ School took over the space on the top floor of St. Patrick’s School. The gym and the labs at Cathedral Boys’ had to be shared between the boys and the girls.
In 1951, the memorial Wing was added onto Cathedral Boys’. In 1955, the girls moved into their new building on Main Street two blocks east of the boys’ school. It was not until 1992 that the two separate high schools were amalgamated into one Cathedral High School.
In 1995, the new state-of-the-art facility on Wentworth Street was open, merging both the boys and girls into one school, instead of sharing the old two sites together. The Wentworth Street site is still in use to this day.
The new school brought amalgamation and new progress. Cathedral High School has the Board's French Immersion program, a state of the art ESL program, as well as the Academic, Applied and locally developed courses to meet the needs of all students. Cathedral also has programs in the technologies including Food Services, Communications Technology, Construction Technology, Cosmetology, Automotive Technology, Technological Design and Health Care. Other exciting courses include Art, Drama and Music. The Physical Education program is also extensive, offering many sport-focused courses. Cathedral has one of the largest high school gymnasiums in the country. Cathedral’s tradition of service, caring, compassion and striving for excellence is a source of pride and inspiration for future generations.
Reunions & Anniversaries
In 2003 The school celebrated 75 years with a large gala event hosted at The Wentworth Street location, and was attended by various alumni. School Archive materials were on display, there was live music in the gymnasium, a catered dinner, and an anniversary Mass was celebrated in The Board of Governor's Forum, which was attended by approximately 600 people.
On September 28 and 29, 2012, Cathedral High School celebrated its 100th Year Reunion as the Cathedral tradition dates back to 1912. Visit http://www.cathedral100yearsreunion.ca/ for photos from the event.
Student Clubs
Cathedral offers many clubs that students can join:
Student Council, CHSTV News, Eco Team, Year End video Crew, Glee, Choir, Band, SWAT, Health Action Team, Yo Go Girl, Best Buddies, Board Game Club, Cathedral Works, Reading Club, Breakfast Club, Gael Guides, Culture of Life, Art Club, Stage Crew, Gael Gazette, Diversity Ambassadors, and many more.

Milan Vidmar proposed the major chess tournament that became Bled 1931. His idea was well received in both Ljubljana (his birthplace) and the nearby health resort of Bled. An organizing committee was set up, and at the end of July 1931, following the 4th Chess Olympiad in Prague this committee commissioned Hans Kmoch to conduct the negotiations with the competitors for a double round tournament to be held at Lake Bled. 
José Raúl Capablanca could not be invited due to his disputes with world champion Alexander Alekhine. Fourteen leading chess masters accepted their invitations. The players stayed at the Hotel Toplice and it was here that most of the tournament except Round 19 (held in Ljubljana) took place. Round one started in the large salon on August 23. Alekhine won decisively, not losing a single game and winning the tournament 5½ points ahead of Efim Bogoljubow. His gambit style was humiliating for the other players.

South Atlantic Invasive Species Project

The South Atlantic Invasive Species Project is a three year project (December 2006 - December 2009) funded under the European Union EDF 9. The purpose of the project is to increase the capacity of the UK's South Atlantic Overseas Territories to deal with invasive species issues. The territories involved are Saint Helena, Tristan da Cunha, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, the Falkland Islands and Ascension Island. The project is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) on behalf of the partner governments. In addition to the partner governments, two NGOs: Falklands Conservation and the Saint Helena National Trust are key stakeholders.
Project progress.
The project started with the appointment of two project officers, Andrew Darlow, for Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, and Brian Summers for the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands.
During the course of the project, Dr Phil Lambdon discovered a living example of a type of sedge on Saint Helena, "Bulbostylis neglecta", that had not been seen for over 200 years and was previously feared extinct.
Clare Miller who manages the South Atlantic Invasive Species project said:
Saint Helena’s wildlife has been ravaged by species introduced to the island. Goats, gorse, grasses, and cage birds have all been liberated on the island where they have wreaked havoc with the native species. Saint Helena is a noted extinction hotspot, driven largely by non-native species, and the native birds have suffered more here than many other islands. Of eight species of bird confined to the island, seven have become extinct since the island’s discovery in 1502.

Allerheiligen-Hofkirche

The Allerheiligen-Hofkirche (Court Church of All Saints) is a church in the Munich Residence (the royal palace of the Bavarian monarchs) designed by Leo von Klenze and built between 1826 and 1837. The church was badly damaged from bombing during World War II and for decades remained a ruin before undergoing partial restoration and secularization. It is now used for concerts and events.
History.
The "Allerheiligen-Hofkirche" was commissioned in 1825 by Ludwig I of Bavaria, inspired by the Cappella Palatina, the richly decorated Byzantine royal chapel in Palermo, where he had attended Christmas mass in 1823. The commission marked a reversal of the policy of secularisation, carried out under his father Maximilian I at the beginning of the century. Leo von Klenze (1784-1864) produced various designs between 1826 and 1828, using not only the Capella Palatina, but also St Mark's in Venice as inspiration. Even before a design had been agreed there had been a ceremonial laying of the foundation stone in 1826; and the church was completed and dedicated on October 29, 1837.
On April 25, 1944, bombs destroyed all but the outer walls. The rich interior ornament was almost completely lost. Although other parts of the Residence were restored soon after the war, the ruined church was left to deteriorate for many years. In 1986 the decision was made to restore it. The restoration was completed in 2003, together with the recreation of an enclosed garden, the "Kabinettsgarten", on its north side. No attempt was made to recreate the original ornament in the restored building, which instead in its simplicity shows the architectural qualities of Klenze's design. It is now used for concerts and events, within the limits of respecting its former character as a church.

Awesome Festival

The Awesome Festival (officially the Awesome International Arts Festival for Bright Young Things) is an arts event in Perth, Western Australia held each November since 1995. The participation and interaction of younger visitors is encouraged by street theatre, interactive art, dance workshops, film screenings and musical performances. It is organised and run by Awesome Arts Australia, a not-for-profit company based in Perth. 
The company is involved with separate programs, including a food art program in the remote mining town of Leonora and other school community projects that create works to showcase at the festival. Some of these are sponsored by its commercial partner, the multinational mining company BHP Billiton Nickel West.
The festival has featured international acts including a contemporary dance group from Canada and Architects of Air, a United Kingdom-based group designing large inflatable sculptures; minor acts have performed shows exclusive to Perth from France, Taiwan, New Zealand and around the country. Kismet, the prominent theatre company from Puglia, Italy, performed a dance and acrobatics version Beauty and the Beast in 2002, prior to touring elsewhere in Australia.
The 2003 program included an interactive video by Melbourne arts group Chunky Move, a migration and colonisation performance by Hong Kong's City Contemporary Dance Company and the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, contemporary dance by Canadian group Cas Public. Artists and groups from Belgium, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Slovenia and France also performed or displayed their work. A performance by Slovenian artist Matej Andraž Vogrinčič involved filling a building site with thousands of beach balls, as a tribute to childhood beach games, and Belgian performance artist Caroline Amorous performed her character Rose, an eccentric old lady interacting with people on the street while walking a poster of a dog. Architects of the Air, based on a design by Nottingham and Geneva-based artist Alan Parkinson, exhibited Ixilum following the similar Arcazzar exhibit in 2002. Ixilum was a small inflatable city, inspired by Iranian architecture and formerly displayed at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain.

Areas of Research.
His scientific and clinical work focuses on cardiovascular electrophysiology, particularly on atrial fibrillation. He is best known for his remarkable contributions in the area of atrial fibrillation ablation. He was the first to detect the importance of pulmonary vein triggers and drivers in the genesis of atrial fibrillation. In addition, he was first to propose the technique of pulmonary vein isolation, which underlies current methods used throughout the world for atrial fibrillation cure. He and his colleagues have extended these observations to include ablative lesions between the veins and to the mitral annulus - left atrial isthmus blocks. 
Haïssaguerre has published more than 412 publications in the leading peer-reviewed cardiology journals dealing mainly with radiofrequency current endocardial ablation of tachyarrhythmias.

Tropical Storm Julio (2008)

Tropical Storm Julio was a tropical storm that made landfall on the southern tip of Baja California Sur in August 2008. The tenth named storm of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season, it developed from a tropical wave on August 23 off the coast of Mexico. It moved parallel to the coast, reaching peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) before moving ashore and weakening. On August 26 it dissipated in the Gulf of California. Julio was the third tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Pacific Ocean basin during the season, after Tropical Storm Alma, which struck Nicaragua in May, and Tropical Depression Five-E, which moved ashore along southwestern Mexico in July. The storm brought locally heavy rainfall to southern Baja California, killing one person and leaving several towns isolated. Moisture from Julio reached Arizona, producing thunderstorms, including one which damaged ten small planes in Chandler.
Meteorological history.
On August 20, a tropical wave became discernible about 800 miles (1300 km) off the coast of Mexico, which in the next day developed a large area of convection, or thunderstorms. Initially, conditions were unfavorable for development, due to strong upper-level wind shear. Tracking northwestward parallel to the Mexican coast, the system became better organized on August 22, though later that day its structure deteriorated. On August 23, a strong area of convection developed and persisted near a circulation center, despite strong wind shear. With banding features becoming more prominent, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Eleven-E about 345 miles (555 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.
The tropical depression initially moved northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a ridge over Mexico. Convection continued to develop to the west of the center, and late on August 23, a ship report confirmed the depression intensified Tropical Storm Julio. Initially, the persistent shear left the center partially exposed from the thunderstorm activity, though upper level conditions gradually became more favorable for strengthening. On August 24, Tropical Storm Julio attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) as intense convection developed near the center. Shortly thereafter, the center became difficult to locate, and late on August 24 the storm moved ashore along the southwestern coast of the Baja California Peninsula.
Tropical Storm Julio quickly weakened over land, although it initially maintained strong convection near its center. By early on August 26, however, the low-level and upper-level circulations separated, with the upper-circulation continuing quickly northeastward into mainland Mexico; the low-level circulation slowed as it entered the Gulf of California, after having been separated from its deep convection. Later in the day, the NHC discontinued advisories after the storm failed to maintain enough organized convection to be considered a tropical cyclone.
Preparations and impact.
Shortly before it was named, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch in the state of Baja California Sur, from Santa Fe on the Pacific coast around the peninsula to Buenavista along the Gulf of California. About 24 hours prior to landfall, the watch was replaced with a warning from Santa Fe to San Evaristo, and the tropical storm watch was extended along both sides of the peninsula. Prior to it making landfall, more than 2,500 families in susceptible areas left their homes. Officials opened several shelters in the area where the storm struck.
As Julio made landfall, it produced lightning and locally heavy rainfall, which left more than a dozen communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people. Winds were generally light, although strong enough to damage a few electrical poles and small buildings. In nearby Sinaloa, rainfall from the storm led to an emergency evacuation of 500 residents.
Moisture from Julio developed thunderstorms across Arizona, including one near Chandler which produced winds of 75 mph (120 km/h); the storm damaged ten small planes at Chandler Municipal Airport, as well as a hangar. The damages at the airport were estimated at $1 million (USD). The storms also dropped heavy rainfall, reaching over 1 inch (25 mm) in Gilbert, which caused flooding on Interstate 17.

Mr. Chin's Gourmet Paradise

"Mr. Chin's Gourmet Paradise" is a platformer video game for the Nintendo Game Boy.
The point of the game is to feed Mr. Chin some momos, which are turned into peaches via the Demoe beam. Bricks can be broken inside the games levels to obtain power-ups. Points in the game are actually "calories;" which determine how well-fed Mr. Chin is. There are a pre-determined number of enemies that must be defeated before Mr. Chin can move on to the next level. Being invincible automatically turns all opponents into edible peaches.

Sutherland AFC

Sutherland Australian Football Club are an Australian rules football club based in the Sydney region of the Sutherland Shire.
The Southern Power "(as they are known)" play their games at Gwawley Park in Taren Point. The club competes in the Sydney AFL competition. They have 5 sides, currently their seniors compete in the Sydney AFL Division 1, reserves in Division 3, 3rds in Division 4, Under 18's Division 2 and a women's team.
Formation.
Sutherland Australian Football Club Inc. was originally founded in 1972 in the Sydney Football Association (SFA). Founding members included Kerry and Rob Mowlam "(Rob was the First President)", Ray Jemmeson, Graham Baldock and Bill Free. The club was known as the Southern Sharks until 2008 when, at an Extraordinary General Meeting, the club members voted unanimously to change their name to the Southern Power. Reasons behind the change included a desire for the Senior and Under 18's teams to play under the same team colours and emblem, and also a wish for the team differentiate itself from the many other teams in the region who had the Shark as their emblem.
History.
After the consolidation of the SFA and SFL leagues in Sydney, the club ended up with teams in Division 2, Division 3 and U18s Division 2.
1st Grade Sydney AFL Division 1 (2011–present), Sydney AFL Division 2 (2007-2010)
The team was elevated to Division 1 in 2011 after a long string of success which included 3 Division 2 Grand Final appearances in 2007,2009,2010 and a Premiership in 2010 against UTS Bats. The elevation to Division 1 in 2011 did not slow the club down and again the team made the Grand Final only to fall short of Manly Wolves by 10pts. The team again finished runners up in 2012, before triumphing over UNSW as premiers in 2013, with a Grand Final score of 105 to 20.
2nd Grade Sydney AFL Division 3 (2007–present)
3rd Grade Sydney AFL Division 4 (2010, 2012–present), Sydney AFL Division 5 (2011)
During 2010 the club experienced significant growth and consequently added a 3rd grade team which competed in Division 4. The 3rd graders finished 12th of 14 teams, with 5 wins from 18 games in their debut season. This resulted in the team being relegated to Division 5 in 2011.
However 2011 produced a marked improvement in the team through the addition of extra depth by new players and also another preseason under the belt of the returning fleet. The 3rd grade team finished top of the ladder and became undefeated Division 5 2011 Premiers when they defeated Manly Wolves by 14pts in the Grand Final. This premiership success resulted in the team being promoted back to Division 4 for the 2012 season.
Under 18's Sydney AFL U18's Division 2 (2007–present)
Women's Sydney Women's AFL (2010–present)
Club Colours.
The club's colours represent the southern Sydney region colloquially known as the Shire. The colours are light blue, black and white, with a hand holding a lightning bolts the team emblem. While these colours have morphed over the years, they remain essentially the same as they have since the club's foundation.
Home Grounds.
Present - "Gwawley Park, Taren Point"

B1149 road

The B1149 is the most direct route between the town of Holt and the city of Norwich in the county of Norfolk, England. There is no direct A-road alternative. The road joins the A140 north of Norwich at a traffic island close to Norwich International Airport.
From north to south the road passes through:
History.
The route of the B1149 can be seen clearly on Faden’s large-scale map (at one inch to the mile) of the county of Norfolk of 1779, which shows that this road’s route has changed very little over the years, even after the Parliamentary Enclosure of the early 19th century. On this early map the road is labeled as the Norwich–to–Cley next the Sea road, indicating the road's importance farther back to the 13th century, when Cley was a busy seaport. The road would have been used by the wealthy merchants of Norwich to transport their goods to the port, where a healthy trade was carried out between Norfolk and the Low Countries.
Notable points, northwest to southeast.
Approximately on the left from Holt the road passes Holt Country Park. At Saxthorpe, after , the road now has a bypass to avoid a bridge over the River Bure in Corpusty, which has a 7.5-tonne weight restriction that until recent times meant a large detour for HGVs travelling from Norwich to Holt.
At the roundabout at the northern end of the Corpusty bypass, the road is joined from the west by the B1354 from Thursford. After the road is dissected by the B1145 that connects Kings Lynn to Mundesley on the northeastern coast of Norfolk.
Congestion.
In the morning and evening rush hours the road gets very congested at its southwesterly end, where it converges with the A140 at a roundabout.
Proposed development.
Norwich Northern Distributor road.
The proposed Norwich Northern Distributor Road would link to the A140 road close the its junction with the southern end of B1149 close to Norwich Airport.

Chilton, Oxfordshire

Chilton is a village and civil parish in the Vale of White Horse about southwest of Didcot. The parish was part of Berkshire until the 1974 local government boundary changes transferred the Vale of White Horse to Oxfordshire.
The village is just off the A34 road.

A section of the Grim's Ditch forms part of the southern boundary of the parish. The prehistoric Ridgeway National Trail passes to the south of the village.
The Domesday Book of 1086 lists the parish.
In 1644 the village was the site of a minor incident following the Second Battle of Newbury in which Parliamentarians narrowly escaped being attacked by Royalists.
The Church of England parish church of All Saints dates from the 12th century. Since 1976 the ecclesiatical parish has been united with Harwell.

2009 ATP World Tour

The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour is the elite professional tennis circuit organised by the ATP. The 2009 ATP World Tour calendar comprises the Grand Slam tournaments (supervised by the International Tennis Federation (ITF)), the ATP World Tour Masters 1000, the ATP World Tour 500 series, the ATP World Tour 250 series, the ATP World Team Championship, the Davis Cup (organized by the ITF), and the ATP World Tour Finals. Also included in the 2009 calendar is the Hopman Cup, which does not distribute ranking points, and is organised by the ITF.
2009 is remembered for being the year that saw Pete Sampras' Grand Slam singles record be beaten by Roger Federer, who won his 15th title at Wimbledon. Federer also completed his Career Grand Slam at the French Open.
Tour changes.
The ATP reinstated the word tour to its name as the organisation rebranded itself as the ATP World Tour. ATP World Tour tournaments in 2009 are classified as ATP World Tour Masters 1000, ATP World Tour 500, and ATP World Tour 250. Broadly speaking the Tennis Masters Series tournaments became the new Masters 1000 level and ATP International Series Gold and ATP International Series events became ATP 500 level and 250 level events.
The Masters 1000 includes tournaments at Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome, Madrid, Toronto/Montreal, Cincinnati, Shanghai and Paris. The end-of-year event, the Tour Finals, moved to London. Hamburg has been displaced by the new clay court event at Madrid, which is a new combined men's and women's tournament. From 2011, Rome and Cincinnati will also be combined tournaments. Severe sanctions will be placed on top players skipping the Masters 1000 series events, unless medical proof is presented. Plans to eliminate Monte Carlo and Hamburg as Masters Series events led to controversy and protests from players as well as organisers. Hamburg and Monte Carlo filed lawsuits against the ATP, and as a concession it was decided that Monte Carlo remains a Masters 1000 level event, with more prize money and 1000 ranking points, but it would no longer be a compulsory tournament for top-ranked players. Monte Carlo later dropped its suit. Hamburg was "reserved" to become a 500 level event in the summer. Hamburg did not accept this concession, but later lost its suit.
The 500 level includes tournaments at Rotterdam, Dubai, Acapulco, Memphis, Barcelona, Hamburg, Washington, Beijing, Tokyo, Basel and Valencia.
The ATP & ITF have declared that 2009 Davis Cup World Group and World Group Playoffs award a total of up to 500 points. Players accumulate points over the 4 rounds and the playoffs and these are counted as one of a player's four best results from the 500 level events. An additional 125 points are given to a player who wins all 8 live rubbers and wins the Davis Cup.
Otherwise, the domain name of their website was changed to "www.atpworldtour.com".

The players/nations are sorted by: 1) total number of titles (a doubles title won by two players representing the same nation counts as only one win for the nation); 2) cumulated importance of those titles (one Grand Slam win equalling two Masters 1000 wins, one ATP World Tour Finals win equalling one-and-a-half Masters 1000 win, one Masters 1000 win equalling two 500 events wins, one 500 event win equalling two 250 events wins); 3) a singles > doubles > mixed doubles hierarchy; 4) alphabetical order (by family names for players).

The 2008 year-end rankings include the number of points under the 2008 points system, and doubled, as they were at the end of the year by the ATP, to fit the 2009 points system (the doubles (team) rankings points were not doubled, as they were calculated under the ATP Race points system in 2008). The doubled year-end rankings were never officially published though, as the first rankings of 2009 already counted the drop of the 2008 season openers' points due to a calendar change.

Richard Penn (governor)

Richard Penn, Jr. (27 May 1735 – 27 May 1811, Richmond, Surrey, England) served as the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania from 1771 to 1773, and was later a member of the British Parliament.
Penn, of Laleham in Middlesex, was the second son of Richard Penn, Sr. (1706–1771) and the grandson of the William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. He was educated at Eton College and St John's College, Cambridge before joining the Inner Temple. In 1763 he and his brother John visited Pennsylvania, of which his family were still sole proprietors. He was qualified as a councilor on January 12, 1764. In 1771 he returned to Pennsylvania and was appointed Lieutenant Governor. He soon became Acting Governor when his brother returned to England to attend to the colony's legal interests. He proved popular with the provincials, taking much care over their commercial interests, but less so with his uncle, the Proprietor. After two years he was supplanted by the re-appointment of his brother as governor.
On 21 May 1772, at Christ Church, Philadelphia, he married Mary "Polly" Masters, daughter of the late William Masters of Philadelphia. The bride's mother gave them a splendid city house as a wedding present. Penn entertained members of the Continental Congress at his Philadelphia city house, a Virginia delegate, Colonel George Washington, being among his guests. 
Richard Penn was elected a trustee of the College and Academy of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) in 1772, serving as president of the board in 1773 and 1774. With the coming of the Revolution, he retired and returned to England in the summer of 1775, when the Continental Congress entrusted him with the Olive Branch Petition to the King. George III refused to accept the petition, but Penn gave evidence to the House of Lords on the colonies' attitudes toward independence. 
After the conclusion of the American Revolution, he was allowed compensation by the US government for the loss of his proprietary rights in Pennsylvania, and visited Philadelphia again in 1808. James Boswell (who was a friend of Penn's) records that in 1789 the influential Earl of Lonsdale urged the government to appoint Penn as Britain's first Ambassador to the United States, although nothing came of the idea.
Penn entered Parliament in 1784 as member for Appleby, elected on the Lonsdale interest, and subsequently also represented two other Lonsdale-dominated boroughs, Haslemere and Lancaster. He was a reliable supporter of Pitt's government (breaking with the other Lonsdale-backed members to support Pitt over the Regency crisis in 1788–89), but rarely if ever spoke in the House of Commons. He resigned his seat in 1791, but returned to Parliament at the next general election, in 1796.
Richard and Mary Penn had two sons, William Penn (1776–1845) and Richard Penn, FRS (1784–1863), and two daughters, who died without issue. He died at Richmond-on-Thames in 1811.
President's House.
Penn sold his Philadelphia city house to Robert Morris in 1785. From 1790 to 1800, while Philadelphia was the temporary capital of the United States, it served as the executive mansion for Presidents George Washington and John Adams until the national capital moved to Washington, DC in November 1800.

Rapid transit in Germany

Rapid transit in Germany consists of five U-Bahn systems and thirteen S-Bahn systems. The U-Bahn or Untergrundbahn ("underground railway") are conventional rapid transit systems that run mostly underground, while the S-Bahn or Stadtschnellbahn ("city rapid railway") are hybrids of rapid transit and commuter rail that run underground in the city centers and above ground in the suburbs. There are also eighteen premetro or Stadtbahn systems that are rapid transit in the city center and light rail outside. 
The U-Bahn consists of five systems: in Berlin, Frankfurt (only line U4), Hamburg, Munich and Nuremberg; these are all run by the transit authorities in the city.
The thirteen S-Bahn systems are in Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg, Hanover, Magdeburg, Mitteldeutschland, Munich, Nuremberg, Rhein-Main, Rhein-Neckar, Rhein-Ruhr (parts thereof also trademarked as Rhein-Sieg and/or Cologne), Rostock and Stuttgart. The S-Bahn systems are all franchised to the incumbent train operating company Deutsche Bahn, and have developed from the mainline railways. Normal headway is 20 minutes and use dedicated tracks running alongside mainline routes. Ticketing is governed by the local transport authority (Verkehrsverbund) and connectivity is integrated into the city public transport system.
History.
S-Bahn.
In 1882, the growing number of steam-powered trains around Berlin prompted the Prussian State Railways to construct separate rail tracks for suburban traffic. The "Berliner Stadtbahn" connected Berlin's eight intercity rail stations which were spread throughout the city. A lower rate for the newly founded "Berliner Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn" (Berlin City, Circular and Suburban Rail) was introduced on 1 October 1891. This rate and the growing succession of trains made the short-distance service stand out from other railroads. The second suburban railroad was the "Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn" connecting Hamburg with Altona and Blankenese. The Altona office of the Prussian State Railroad established the steam powered railroad in 1906.
The beginning of the 20th century saw the first electric trains, which operated at 15,000 V on overhead lines. As the steam powered trains came to be nuisances to more and more people, the "Berliner Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn" switched to direct current wagons running on 750 V from a third rail. In 1924, the first electrified route went into service. The third rail was chosen because it made both the modifications of the rail tracks (especially in tunnels and under bridges) and the side-by-side use of electric and steam trains easier. To set it apart from its competitor, the subterranean U-Bahn, the term "S-Bahn" replaced "Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn" in 1930.
The Hamburg service had established an experimental alternating current line in 1907. The whole network still used steam power until 1940, when the old locomotives were replaced by 1200 V DC electric ones. In 1934, the "Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn" was renamed as S-Bahn.
U-Bahn.
The term U-Bahn was created at the beginning of the 20th century in Berlin, where the "Hochbahngesellschaft" ("elevated railway company"), operating elevated and suburban lines, decided they required an equally short and memorable name for their system as the S-Bahn, and chose to called it U-Bahn (with the U standing for "Untergrund", German for "Underground"). The name was soon adopted for Hamburg's city-owned independent mass transit tram lines.
As the post-World War II rebuilding led to wealth and prosperity in West Germany, a modal shift towards travel by car motivated many larger city councils to plan the replacement of the traffic-obstructing tramways with U-Bahn systems and bus routes. Nuremberg and Munich decided on a full U-Bahn (like those in Berlin and Hamburg) independent from their existing tramways. Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Cologne, Bonn, Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Bochum, Essen, Dortmund, Gelsenkirchen, Herne, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Hanover and Bielefeld started to build tunnels for their existing trams, rebuilding tram lines underground. Those systems of tram in tunnels in city centre areas do not meet the criteria of a metro; they are instead light rail systems. Nonetheless, they are usually referred to as U-Bahn. Officially, they are called "Stadtbahn" ("city railways") or "U-Stadtbahn".
During the 1990s, when, according to original planning, the tramways of Nuremberg and Munich were scheduled to disappear, a reorientation process set in. Shortage of money, increased passenger numbers and the insight that larger streets only attract even more cars slowed the building of rapid transit lines and led to a renaissance of the tramways in those cities that had forgotten them. In Nuremberg and Munich, after 30 years new rolling stock was purchased, existing lines were modernised, and new ones were built, leading to new integrated traffic concepts. Today, Berlin, Munich and Nuremberg not only have buses, but also trams, S-Bahn, and U-Bahn systems, each with non-shared tracks and different vehicles.
Ticketing.
Contrary to practice in most countries, rapid transit in Germany is generally uncontrolled by security gates. Rather, plainclothes ticketing-check officers conduct regular inspections and can issue a fine (of 40 EUR by the rule, as per 2014,) to passengers who do not have a paid-for ticket.

Luigi Riccio

Luigi Ginginiello Riccio (born 1957) is a former Italian Camorrista who is now a pentito. While initially a member of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, Riccio switched sides and joined the rival Nuova Famiglia only eight months before his collaboration with the Italian Justice department in 1983. He was one of the eight major pentiti whose testimony dealt a massive blow to the NCO's organizational structure. By the time of his defection, Luigi Riccio had a reputation as one of the bloodiest and most fearsome killers in the NCO, but was also considered to be a fickle individual for his well known propensity of switching sides.
Biography.
Early years.
Not much is known about the early life of Luigi Riccio. The bulk of his profile comes from the tape of Riccio's confession to the instructing judge in charge of the prosecution of the Nuova Famiglia. On January 6, 1979, Riccio was officially inducted into the organization by NCO boss, Raffaele Cutolo himself, with Nicola Nuzzo, a "Capozona" (Capo-area) and Riccio's fellow villager as his godfather. Riccio was 22 years old at the time of his induction, and was immediately put in charge of a gambling house in his native village, Ponticelli. There, Riccio was soon involved in the various beatings that had to be given to gamblers who were unable to pay their gambling debts. Sometimes, the beatings gravitated towards murder, a circumstance that he would later characterize as unintentional: ""They were intended as warnings and if they turned into murders, that was accidental"."
Capozona of Ponticelli.
When Nicola Nuzzo was arrested in 1980, Riccio had succeeded him as the Capozona of Ponticelli. He gathered under him a small but deadly group of associates which included Salvatore Imperatrice, Mario Incarnato, Carmine Argentato, his brother-in-law Vincenzo Duraccio, and Ernesto D'Alessandri. This group soon came to be known for its inclination to resolve any disputes by the authority of their firepower, and with the progress of time, its services became increasingly in demand in other areas under the NCO's control. 
Riccio's resolution for killing had been tested immediately after his induction, when he was personally asked by Raffaele Cutolo to kill the wife of Ciro Nocerino, another member of the NCO. This woman had been found guilty of not having respected her husband's honor while he was in jail and sentenced to death. However, Riccio was hesitant to kill a woman and Nocerino himself had some doubts about the harsh punishment. Eventually, he wrote to Riccio asking him not to kill his wife, but to paralyze her with a shot to the back, in order to condemn her to a wheelchair for the rest of her life. 
Riccio willingly obliged, and together with Carmine Argentato promptly executed the request by shooting her both in the legs and arms while she was lying on her bed. In spite of this, Cutolo was not satisfied and ordered her death again. Meanwhile, Riccio was arrested, fell ill and was transferred to the Poggioreale's infirmary. Upon hearing of this news, Nocerino drank a mixture of ethyl alcohol, cigarette butts and ashes which made him ill and put him in the same infirmary with a 104 degree fever. There he expressed his wish to see his wife suffer a public death on Ponticelli's main square. Riccio was finally convinced to relay this request outside to his group and Salvatore Imperatrice attended to her execution by first shooting her, then strangling her, and finally burning her to ashes.
More murders.
When Riccio was finally released for the expiration period prior to the trial, he went on a murderous mission of catching up on unfinished vendettas. He started by killing a man who had slapped him, Then he shot three NF members in San Giorgio a Cremano. Finally, he killed two men who were guilty of having robbed a gambling house protected by the NCO. Riccio vividly remembered this last episode because the corpses had been buried 50 yards away from his house, but after a while he became anxious and decided to move them to the cemetery of a nearby village. He also precisely remembered the burial ground because Salvatore Imperatrice used to go now and then to urinate on the spot. This act was called ""alla faccia loro"" (on their face) and by doing so, he was offending their honor. In Riccio's recollection of events, he remembered that Imperatrice was always the fall guy. 
For instance, Imperatrice once killed a common acquaintance because, while he was kissing Riccio on the cheek, his hand slipped into the pocket where the latter kept his gun. Imperatrice interpreted this act as an attempt of disarming Riccio. He then fired a round of bullets into the man's body. As a result of these murders, Riccio was able to gather substantial power and the organization slowly came to depend on him for all the violent actions in the Neapolitan hinterland. Riccio was invested with the authority to decide murders, administer beatings, and other violence related business. 
As a branch manager in the NCO, he showed himself competent at handling troublesome subordinates by using an innovative style of approach rarely found in the traditional Camorra underworld. For instance, when Antonio Caldarelli aka '"o Malommo" (The Bad Man) refused to promptly execute Riccio's orders, he was sentenced to one month of suspension from the NCO's payroll, a practise found more among Italian soccer players than gangsters.
Downfall.
Ironically, it would be one of these independent decisions that would cause Riccio's downfall. In 1982, Ciro Fiorentino, one of Riccio's personal godsons, became the lover of crew member, Pasquale Damiano's widow only a few weeks after his murder. Riccio who was serving a minor sentence in prison at the time decided to have Fiorentino killed without consulting Cutolo, and asked Carmine Argentato to perform the hit. When knowledge of the murder became public, Riccio was summoned to Cutolo's cell, where both Cutolo and Pasquale D'Amico strongly objected to the murder. 
For Cutolo, the new relationship was acceptable since Fiorentino had belonged to the organization and he harshly scolded Riccio. Insulted by Cutolo's harsh words, Riccio put up a counterarguement: ""If you die and i become the lover of your girlfriend, what would you think of it?"" This was seen as a multiple insult. Cutolo was highly superstitious and took offense at the discussion of his death as well as the eventual betrayal of his memory. He reacted by angrily leaving the room and slamming the door behind him. 
Aware of the symbolic power of social actions in the prison system, Riccio interpreted this as a death sentence. When he was eventually released from prison, Riccio sensed that he was no longer safer within the NCO and he asked for the protection of the Nuova Famiglia in exchange for his skills as a killer. He subsequently became affiliated with the Giuliano clan from Naples' quarter Forcella, and was allowed to continue operating his business for months.
Becoming a Pentito.
When he was arrested again in 1983, Riccio suffered a nervous breakdown. In late 1983, after the death of his wife which left him with a baby daughter to look after, Luigi Riccio decided to collaborate with the Italian Justice system and became a pentito. He would later go on to testify against the NCO in the three-year long Maxi Trial which began in 1983. He would also testify against the members of the NF, during the Maxi Trials which resulted from that organization's crackdown in 1984. 
The event of Riccio's cooperation was followed by that of his one time close friend, Salvatore Imperatrice. However, Imperatrice's testimony was considered untrustworthy. At various times, he confessed to some crimes only to change his mind and withdraw all accusations. At other times, he simply refused to testify. Imperatrice eventually had a severe psychological breakdown and was hospitalized in an asylum. There he committed suicide on March 1989, leaving a legacy of unresolved and tainted accusations.

Background.
Forest Heights Community School, often referred to as FHCS or Forest Heights, was founded in 1992 as part of an amalgamation due to the closing of Chester High School and New Ross High School located in two nearby communities. Forest Heights is seeded by two middle schools – Chester Area Middle School and New Ross Consolidated School.

Forest Heights is actually in Chester Grant, just past the Chester Basin/Chester Grant road signs.
Enrollment.
Given the rural location of FHCS the student body has historically hovered around the 400 student mark with all students having access to school bus transportation. 272 students were officially enrolled in 2013-14. The staff is made up of 22 teachers, 4 teaching assistants, 2 counselors, 2 administrators, 1 secretary, 3 custodians, 3 cafeteria staff and 1 community coordinator. There is currently no librarian presently working there, due to to budget cuts to Nova Scotia education cuts. 
Academics.

Bulgarian Center for Not-For-Profit Law

The Bulgarian Center for Not-For-Profit Law (BCNL), founded in 2001, is a legal entity based in Sofia, Bulgaria with public benefit purposes to provide legal support for the development of civil society in Bulgaria. BCNL is under the guidance of the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) under an Affiliation Agreement. It is registered in the Central Registry at the Ministry of Justice of Bulgaria. It is also a partner of the European Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ECNL) with its headquarters in Budapest.
The BCNL aims at developing a legal framework for non-profit organizations which they believe is vitally important towards the creation of an independent and more prosperous civil society. It operates across Bulgaria, providing expertise and legal assistance to NGOs. The BCNL revolves around three interlinked priority areas of work. These include creating an enabling environment and improvement of the legal and financial framework for increased financial sustainability of NGOs in Bulgaria, assistance to NGOs to provide the knowledge for legal provisions and regulations and the promotion of an inter-government/NGO partnership. The Bulgaria Center also deals a diversity of legal and tax issues, including the private-sector provision of social and healthcare services.
2002.
The BCNL is supported by USAID and the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law in both Bulgarian and international legal expertise. The program has been of notable importance in drawing together multi-party support of a modern legal framework. A new law was drafted in Bulgaria which permitted not-for-profit organizations to engage in economic and legal activity, curbing the state control over the activities of not-for-profit organizations.
In 2002 the BCNL participated with the Ministry of Finance for drafting amendments to pre existing tax laws related
to NGOs. The BCNL initiated a major e-mail campaign for support of the draft amendments on the NGO taxation. This initiative and lobbying elsewhere resulted in the adoption of new tax concessions for NGOs in Bulgaria in December 2002.
During 2002, BCNL operatatives consulted over 140 organizations to undertake the implementation of the basic NGO Law, labor legislation and taxation and signed a partnership agreement with the American Red Cross which provided the obligation to provide legal assistance to the Bulgarian Red Cross. The BCNL worked with the Bulgaria Pilot Community Fund and Social Enterprise Program also, supporting the foundation of three Community Funds in Chepelare, Gabrovo and Blagoevgrad.
2003.
In 2003, the BCNL and the Open Society Foundation of Sofia continued their campaign for draft amendments of the Not-for-Profit Legal Entities Act. These proposals included the abolition of the dividend tax for public benefit NGOs, the right to withhold 50% of the corporate tax on related economic activity by public benefit NGOs, and th inclusion of public benefit NGOs among the recipients of donations exempted from value added tax. However, although the proposals were supported by the Parliamentary Civil Society Committee, the Ministry of Finance did not approve of the proposals and did not include them in drafting amendments to the tax laws. In 2003 together with the Open Society Foundation and the Program and Analytical Center for European Law, the BCNL started a joint initiative for creating a central guideline for financial sustainability of the NGO sector in Bulgaria. Their objective was to systematize different tools that would aid the financial independence of NGOs in the country and to provide knowledge on legislation to increase their power. The BCNL also initiated the preparation of a NGO Law Textbook, which presented an in-depth analysis on the NGO legal framework in Bulgaria. In 2003, the BCNL completed a project on the “Legal Arrangements on Hospices in the Republic of Bulgaria” and published three books related to the subject. In December, 2003 they initiated a project called ”Social Services in
Bulgaria – new opportunities for development“ which was funded by the PHARE Civil Society Development Program of the European Union. It was conducted for 8 months ending in July 2004 which the objective to develop the system of social services in Bulgaria and facilitating a partnership between NGOs and municipalities in the social sector.
2004.
At the end of 2004, the BCNL helped the municipalities of Pazardzhik, Drianovo and Byala Slatina to organize 7 of the first competitions in Bulgaria for contracting out of social services. The initiation was followed by several other municipalities and social services reform at a local level and established public councils. In 2004 the BCNL signed a partnership with the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP) to facilitate this social reform and provided a cooperation with various other state institutions in this area, aiming at achieving the decentralization of social services in Bulgaria and providing new and modern alternatives to social policy in the country.
2005.
In February 2005, the Bulgarian Center for Not-For-Profit Law conducted a nationwide Survey on the legal problems of
non-profit organizations in Bulgaria. They drew up a concept paper for changes to NGO legislation based on the analysis of the results of this survey. The BCNL organized a campaign for discussing this new Concept Paper which was sent to over 3000 organizations and well publicized in public events and seminars. In the end over 400 Bulgarian organizations supported the documentation and provided the background to new NPO legislation in 2006. In 2005 the BCNL aimed to strengthen informal NPO alliances under the project Strategy for Strengthening the Sustainability of the Non-Profit Sector in Bulgaria, playing a key role in the organisation of meetings and in legislative priorities of the political parties who cooperated. In the social sphere, they formed a partnership with the Bulgarian Association for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (BAPID) to provide mutual support on social projects, training and initiatives, with the BCNL providing legal aid to the BAPID and to further their objectives of social services decentralization. This involved the entity in international conferences held in Lisbon and Brussels. In November 2005 they established the Association of Social Enterprises in Bulgaria in Varna in which 26 organizations formed a social enterprise alliance.
The BCNL also attempted to address problems with VAT law registration in European program financing
Including the PHARE Civil Society Development Program, a meeting was held with the Delegation of the European Commission in Bulgaria with the new Deputy Minister of Finance Georgi Kadiev to discuss reforms but it was eventually upheld. In 2005 they also worked in partnership with the Bulgarian Charities Aid Foundation and the Bulgarian Donors’ Forum and in the October participated in an experts’ group that made further proposals to the Maecenas Law prior to its second parliamentary reading. The BCNL published the book on Social Entrepreneurship and Control on the Social Services in Bulgaria and in the European Union analysing the legal framework of social enterprise in Bulgarian legislation, and controls on social services in Bulgarian and the European Union and to examine the current trend in social reform. They also published the books "What is a Social Enterprise?", a question and answer publication published with financial aid from the European Union and Philanthropy for Cultural Organizations in Bulgaria with the intent to analyse the existing legal regime of cultural organizations and stipulated legal possibilities for philanthropy and sponsorship of cultural and tax initiatives.
2007.
In 2007, the Bulgarian Center for Not-For-Profit Law opposed a new bill for the modification and amendment of the Law on Taxes introduced in Parliament, which attempted to cancel of all types of tax deduction for donors. The BCNL saw the bill as a way in which the Bulgarian government were attempting to counteract the large number of non-profit organizations now running in the country.
However the BCNL has worked with the government and received support on many of its initiatives. On May 16, 2007 the BCNL organized a charity event in the Central Military Club in Sofia to raise funds for the establishment of a crisis centre for homeless people in Veliko Tarnovo. The event which was coordinated under the banner “Let’s help homeless people change their destiny” received support from the Bulgarian Ministry of Labour and Social
Policy and the Municipality of Veliko Tarnovo.
In October 2007 the BCNL attended a conference held by the European Citizen Action Service (ECAS) in Brussels within “The Next Mile of the European Civil Society Infrastructure” Programme. The mission was to provide help to NGOs in the EU with advice on how to lobby, fund raise and protect the rights of European citizens.
Staff.
Luben Panov is the director of the entity. Notable legal consultants working for the BCNL include Marieta Dimitrova, Nadya Shabani, Mila Boyanova, Ralitsa Velichkova, Atanas Slavov and Pavleta Alexieva.

Wrestlers portrayed either a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The event featured wrestlers from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—a storyline division in which WWE employees are assigned to the television program of the same name.
The main rivalry heading into Backlash 2009 pitted Triple H against Randy Orton over the WWE Championship. The feud had started on the February 16 episode of "Raw", when Orton punted Triple H's brother-in-law, Shane McMahon and then performed the RKO on his wife Stephanie McMahon. As a result, Triple H convinced Orton to challenge him for the WWE title at WrestleMania XXV. At WrestleMania on April 5, 2009, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the championship. The following night on "Raw", WWE chairman Vince McMahon announced that a six-man tag team match would take place at Backlash between Triple H, Shane McMahon, and himself against The Legacy (Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) which was later turned into a WWE Championship match by new General Manager of Raw, Vickie Guerrero. That same night, Shane and Triple H were attacked by The Legacy, but were saved by a returning Batista. Vince announced that Batista would be taking his place at Backlash. On the following week's episode of "Raw", after returning to WWE the week before, Batista arrived on the night of the WWE Draft lottery. Batista made clear his desire to face Orton on "Raw" and take revenge for the punt that kept him from the ring for four months. He was later joined in the ring by both Shane McMahon and WWE Champion Triple H, who both wanted to get their hands on Orton for his attacks on Stephanie McMahon and the WWE Chairman himself, Mr. McMahon. As the three argued over who would get first dibs on Orton, they were interrupted by Vickie Guerrero, who announced that only one of them would get the opportunity to face Orton before Backlash, and that they would have to earn it. Guerrero then placed Triple H, Batista and Shane McMahon in a three-on-two Handicap match against The Legacy for later in the night. Whichever one of them would score the pinfall on either Rhodes or DiBiase will have earned themselves a match against Orton on the next "Raw", but if The Legacy prevailed, then none of the three would be able to get their hands on him. Triple H pinned DiBiase. On the last episode of "Raw", Orton defeated Triple H in a No disqualification match despite of their teammates interfering during the match. Then a few days later on "SmackDown", Batista and Shane McMahon defeated DiBiase and Rhodes in a tag team match.
Another rivalry heading into Backlash brought together John Cena and Edge over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's February pay-per-view event, No Way Out on February 15, 2009, Edge attacked Kofi Kingston, who was due to compete in an Elimination Chamber match for Cena's World Heavyweight Championship. As a result, Edge took his spot in the match and won the title by last eliminating Rey Mysterio. At WrestleMania XXV, Cena defeated the defending champion Edge and The Big Show in a Triple Threat match to win the championship back. On the April 6 episode of "Raw", Vickie Guerrero announced that Cena would defend his World Heavyweight Championship against Edge in a Last Man Standing match at Backlash.
Interim General manager Tiffany announced on the April 7 episode of "ECW on Sci Fi" that Jack Swagger would defend his ECW Championship against the winner of the "elimination chase", which commenced on that night and featured Christian, Tommy Dreamer, Finlay, and Mark Henry; the participants in the chase would have a four-way that night. Henry got pinned the same night and was eliminated from contention. The remaining three wrestlers competed in a Triple Threat match on the April 14 episode of "ECW on Sci Fi" with the person being pinned or forced to submit being eliminated from contention; Dreamer was pinned in this contest, leading to a singles match between Finlay and Christian on the April 16 episode of "WWE Superstars", which saw Christian get the victory, thus allowing him to face Swagger for the title at Backlash.
After Matt Hardy betrayed his brother, Jeff, at Royal Rumble — costing the latter the WWE Championship against Edge —the two embarked on a feud that saw Jeff initially reluctant to fight his brother; after much goading, they had a match at WrestleMania XXV, which saw Matt win; however, with Jeff not fully incapacitated after Matt had vowed to "erase Jeff from the WWE", a stretcher match took place between the two, which Matt also won. As a result of their feud, the SmackDown general manager, Theodore Long, announced an "I Quit" match between the two at Backlash.
After the release of the film, "The Wrestler", and the film's actor Mickey Rourke backing out of a challenge that he had earlier issued to Chris Jericho to a match at WrestleMania XXV, Jericho started targeting WWE's legends and Hall of Famers by insulting and beating them over many weeks on "Raw". (These legends included the likes of Ric Flair, Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka and Ricky Steamboat.) At WrestleMania XXV, Jericho defeated Piper, Snuka and Steamboat in a Handicap Elimination match. After winning, Jericho called Rourke out in the ring. During the confrontation between the two, Rourke knocked Jericho down with a punch. Then, on the April 20 episode of "Raw", it was announced that Jericho would face Ricky Steamboat in a singles match at Backlash.
Event.
Before the event began and aired live on pay-per-view, a dark match took place in which Kofi Kingston defeated Dolph Ziggler in a singles match.
Preliminary matches.
The show commenced with ECW Champion, Jack Swagger, defending his title against Christian. Swagger dominated his opponent early in the match, succeeding in grounding him with takedowns, suplexes, and some heavy slams. Christian managed to capitalize after dodging some of Swagger's attacks before the two both went down; leading to both men staggering into opposite corners, removing the padding on the top turnbuckle closest to their respective positions. As Swagger ran to attack his opponent, Christian dodged one last tackle, letting Swagger's head collide with the exposed steel. Christian then grabbed Swagger by the arms and connected with his finishing move, the killswitch, driving his head into the mat and pinning him to win the ECW Championship, his first World Championship in WWE.
The following contest involved Chris Jericho and Ricky Steamboat — the latter competing in his first singles match since 1994. The match centered around the idea of Jericho viciously attacking his adversary only to have Steamboat retaliate and compete with his younger opponent, executing his signature moves: arm drags, chops, and a diving crossbody, only to have Jericho counter the latter with a knee to the face called the Codebreaker. Following the attack, Jericho grabbed Steamboat's legs, and applied his signature submission hold the Walls of Jericho, with Steamboat ultimately submitting. Following his loss, Steamboat was given a standing ovation from the crowd in attendance.
CM Punk wrestled Kane next, with Punk mainly attacking Kane's arm with kicks and arm bars to prevent him from performing his finishing maneuver, the chokeslam, which requires Kane to lift his opponent with one arm. After Punk tried to incapacitate his opponent, Kane managed to get a hold of Punk's leg to execute a leg-trap chokeslam before pinning him.
The fourth match on the show, the "I Quit" match, featured Matt and Jeff Hardy. The two brothers brutally assaulted each other throughout the match, hitting each other with a number of heavy shots and submission holds, with neither man yielding to the other. After Jeff had gained an advantage with Matt incapacitated, he placed him onto a table, then taped his arms and legs together before strapping him onto the table. Jeff then went under the ring, and withdrew a ladder, and set it up in the corner of the ring closest to his prone opponent. When the referee asked Matt if he wanted to quit, he took the opportunity to talk down Jeff, bringing up the case of what his father and late mother would think of this before uttering the phrase, "I quit". Despite Jeff winning the match and coming down from the ladder onto the top turnbuckle, he still vaulted over the ladder, and performed a leg drop on his brother, going through the table.
Santina Marella (really Santino Marella in drag posing as his fictitious twin sister) came down to the ring after the match, and proclaimed her prowess before The Great Khali entered in the hopes of kissing Marella, only to have Marella refuse, claiming to love another man, "SmackDown" commentator, Jim Ross, who sat at ringside with Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole. This led to Beth Phoenix to come to the ring outraged by what is transpiring with Khali's obliviousness; she challenged Marella for her title of "Miss WrestleMania". Before the match started, Khali hit Phoenix, leading to Marella pinning a capsized Phoenix to retain her title.
Main event matches.
The first of two main event matches on the show involved the six-man tag-team match for the WWE Championship pitting Triple H (the champion), Batista, and Shane McMahon against The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes, and Ted DiBiase). The match started out with Triple H and Orton brawling out of the ring to the backstage area while Batista and McMahon would continue to wrestle The Legacy. Once the two contenders fought their way back into the ring, the match centered around Legacy isolating every member of their opponents, preventing any way for them to make a tag. The tides turned once Batista managed to get into the match, and sent the action onto the outside, and Triple H managing to make the tag. Shortly thereafter, the legal man, Orton, applied his signature move, the RKO, and drove him to the mat on his face. He went for the pin, but his opponent kicked out of it; this led to Orton standing up, and running into his downed opponent with his signature punt. This time, Orton pinned him, winning the title for the third time. Following the match, Triple H was taken out on a stretcher.
The main event saw World Heavyweight Champion, John Cena, defending his title against Edge in a Last Man Standing Match. The match started as a heavy brawl between the two, each trying to beat the other down to reach the ten-count fast, only to have each of them get to their feet in time. The match degenerated to the outside with Edge and Cena using the detachable steel steps connected to the ring as a weapon, as they threw each other into it, threw it at each other, and even have Edge tackle Cena with his finishing move, the Spear. The match continued with both men being only able to incapacitate their opponent for a nine-count until they both ended up on the announcers' table, leading to Cena hoisting Edge up onto his shoulders, and throwing him into the crowd with his finishing maneuver, the Attitude Adjustment. After the wrestlers reached to their feet, they fought around the arena, going into the surrounding lobby until they made their way to the stage, leading to an eventual interruption from their other WrestleMania triple threat match opponent, The Big Show, which had him lift up Cena, and chokeslam him through a nearby spotlight that exploded; Cena was unable to make the ten-count, thus having Edge win the title for the fifth time. In a case similar to Triple H, Cena was taken out of the arena on a stretcher, as the event came to a close.
Aftermath.
Following the results of the main event, The Big Show appeared in a match against Batista the following night on "Raw" to determine who would challenge Randy Orton next for the WWE title. During the match, John Cena came down to the ring, distracting the Big Show, which led to Batista winning the match. Vickie Guerrero would subsequently announce The Big Show would wrestle Cena at Judgment Day, when Cena would be medically cleared to compete in the match.
With Edge winning the World Heavyweight title, the title became exclusive to "SmackDown!", with Jeff Hardy becoming the number-one contender to face Edge at Judgment Day by winning a fatal four-way match against Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio, and Kane.
Not satisfied at how he lost the title (due to his collision with a turnbuckle exposed by Christian, which is technically illegal), Jack Swagger would invoke his rematch clause at Judgment Day, and before that match were to take place, he would make sure that no one would receive a title match before he did by interfering in Christian's matches.
Reception.
The show received positive feedback from many viewers. Canadian sportswriter, Matt Bishop, gave the show an overall score of 7/10; most of his praise for the show concentrated on the World Heavyweight title match, which he awarded 9/10. In addition, Dave Meltzer, writer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, called the show solid, and gave the main event a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five.
Writing for "The Sun", The LilsBoys rated the event a 9/10, stating that the event contained "great matches, solid storylines and well-written endings." They praised the match between Matt and Jeff Hardy, saying that "the ending that was truly something special, one of the best we’ve seen in ages." The LilsBoys also praised the World Heavyweight Championship match, touting it as the "match of the night", and stating the final spot with Big Show throwing Cena into the spotlight was "the year’s most memorable moment so far". The Baltimore Sun's writer, Kevin Eck, also praised the World Heavyweight Championship match, calling it a "show-stealer" and praised the Jericho/Steamboat match, stating that "The booking here was well done, as Steamboat showed that he can still go".
