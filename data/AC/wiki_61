Walkerton Capitals

The Walkerton Capitals were a senior hockey team based out of Walkerton, Ontario, Canada. The Capitals played in the Western Ontario Athletic Association Senior Hockey League for four seasons.
2008-09.
Walkerton began their inaugural season in the league on the road with a 6-3 loss to the Shelburne Muskies. The Capitals lost their next two games to fall to 0-3-0 before earning their first victory, a 4-2 win over the Nottawasaga River Rats. Walkerton would finish the season with a 4-14-2 record, earning 10 points, and ninth place in the WOAA North Division, failing to qualify for the "AA" playoffs.
The Capitals opened the "B" playoffs against the Shallow Lake Crushers, and it was the Crushers who struck first, winning the series opener 6-3. Walkerton continued to dig themselves in a hole, losing the second game 7-5, however, the Capitals played a strong game in the third game, defeating Shallow Lake 6-5 to earn their first ever playoff victory, and cut the Crushers series lead to 2-1. Shallow Lake took the fourth game, doubling Walkerton 4-2, pushing the Capitals on the brink of elimination. Walkerton fought off the Crushers in the fifth game, hanging on for a 3-2 win, however, Shallow Lake ended the series in the sixth game, defeating Walkerton 5-3, and ending the Capitals inaugural season.
2009-10.
Walkerton had another long regular season, as they finished the season with a 4-15-1 record, earning nine points and their second straight ninth place finish in the WOAA North Division, failing to qualify for the "AA" playoffs.
The Capitals faced the Goderich Pirates and Drayton Icemen in a "B" round robin series, with each team playing each other twice. Walkerton opened the round robin against the Pirates, and lost a close contest by a 5-3 score. The Capitals then lost the next game against the Icemen 7-5 to fall to 0-2. Walkerton came out on the wrong end of a 9-5 score against Goderich in their third game, followed by a 3-2 loss to Drayton in the final game to finish the round robin with a 0-4 record, and was eliminated from the post-season.
2010-11.
Walkerton made some positive steps in the 2010-11 season, as they doubled their win total from the previous season, as the team went 8-17-1 to earn a club record 17 points. It wasn't enough for the team to clinch a spot in the "AA" playoffs, as they finished in ninth place in the North Division, and will participate in the "B" round-robin playoff.
2011-12.
The Capitals regressed, with a dismal 2-20-2 record to finish 9th and last in the North Division. They were to face the Thedford Dirty Dogs in the "B" final, however the two sides agreed to forgo the series.
2012-13.
The Capitals took a leave of absence with the intention of taking one year off, but they will not ice a team in 2013/14, either.

Levin (guitar company)

Levin is a Swedish manufacturer of musical instruments founded by Herman Carlson Levin, that was active between 1900 and 1978. The company produced over half a million instruments in the 80 years that it was active, mostly guitars but also mandolines, banjos and lutes, which made Levin into the biggest instrument manufacturer in Scandinavia for many years.
The founding of Levin Instruments.
Herman Carlson Levin was born and raised in Åsaka Sweden; at age 18 he attended carpentry school and later got an apprenticeship at a furniture maker in Gothenburg. In August 1887 Levin moved to America and worked briefly as a carpenter before getting a job in 1888 at guitar manufacturer. Three years later he and two partners started a small production of instruments in New York. After a visit back in Sweden 1895 Levin realized the demand for instruments back home was high and that manufacturing of instruments back in Sweden could be profitable. So with 4,000 kroners Levin opened up "Herman Carlssons Instrumentfabrik" at Norra Larmgatan in Gothenburg. 
With a workshop of 70 m² and a crew of two, Levin started manufacturing guitars and mandolins. By the end of 1901 473 instruments had been made and in 1903, with a crew of five, Levin's 1000th instrument was made.
The factory was one of the best in Europe and between 1904 and 1912 Levin received many awards including the gold medal in Madrid for best guitar as well as the exhibition's Grand Prix price. In the mid-1920s the plant had made over 50,000 instruments and in 1925 production of a line of banjos were launched. By 1936 the 100,000th instrument had left the plant and Levin was marketing a successful line of archtop guitars. Shortly before 1940 Levin employed a crew of 45 in facility of a 1000 m². In the 1950s, Levin launched a line of inexpensive guitars intended for schools and novice guitar players. These guitars were of lower quality than the rest of the Levin line up.
Launching Goya guitars.
In 1952 Jerome Hershman a guitar distributor from America noticed a Levin guitar at a trade show in Germany and convinced the Levin company to let him market their guitars in America. However Hershman knew that the brandname Levin would be hard to market in America and suggested the name Goya. Inspired by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya, who was well known for the guitars that he showed in his paintings. The Goya line up proved to be successful due to its high quality finish. The use of nylon strings also gave the guitar a different tone than most other guitars that used steel strings, making it popular among folk musicians. In the late 1950s, a line of steel-stringed flat-tops were launched, with adjustable trussrods and bolted necks. 
In the early 1960s, a line of "folk-guitars" were launched with wide flat fretboards similar to those on nylon strung guitars, but fitted with steelstrings. These were developed partly in cooperation with American folk-singer Oscar Brandt. Two 12-stringed flattops were launched during the same period. In 1967 a contract was signed between the Levin company and Goya Music (former Hershman Music) for no less than 120.000 instruments over a period of 10 years. At this time the Goya export was approximately 70% of the companies total production which was + 30,000 instruments, mostly guitars. 
The contract was broken by Goya Music in 1968, following the acquisition of Goya Music by Avnet Inc, who already at that time owned Guild Guitars. The Goya distribution rights were sold in 1970 to amplifier manufacturer Kustom Electric of Chanute Kansas. In 1972 Kustom went bankrupt and The distribution was taken over by another Chanute company, Dude Inc. It is unclear if Levin ever delivered any instruments to Dude, the sales made by Dude may have been the remaining stock from the Kustom bankruptcy, which were relabelled.
In 1976 Dude sold the Goya brand to CF Martin who already purchased the majority of the Levin Company a few years earlier. CF Martin started import of Japanese and Korean instruments under the Goya name and both the Goya and Levin brands reputation diminished. CF Martin stopped offering Goya instruments during the 1990s and sold the brand name in 1999 to Goya Foods.
In 1973 when Martin bought Levin, it became the headquarters for Martin Guitars and their Japan import brand Sigma Guitars in Europe, as well as actually producing a run of some 200 Martin D-18 acoustic guitars, which were labelled "LD-18 - Made In Gothenburg, Sweden". In fact, some LD 28 Martins, stamped "Made In Gothenburg" have surfaced. In 1981 the last guitar was built in the Gothenburg facility and parts of the inventory and the brand were bought by Svensk Musik AB, who started producing Levin classical guitars in a factory owned by former guitar neck supplier Hans Persson. Hans's son Lennart is still producing guitars for "Svenska Levin AB" in his fathers workshop outside Mariestad Sweden.
Svenska Levin offers also steel string flattops and a line of archtop jazz guitars based on old Levin models, made in Korea.

Diet in Sikhism

In Sikhism, only vegetarian food is served in the Gurdwara (Sikh temple) but Sikhs are not bound to be meat-free. The general consensus is that Sikhs are free to choose whether to adopt a meat diet or not. Sikhs, once they become Amritdhari (baptised) via the Amrit Sanskar (baptism ceremony), are forbidden from eating Kutha or ritually-slaughtered (Halal, Kosher) meat because it transgresses one of the four restrictions in the Sikh Code of Conduct. According to the Akal Takht (Central Body for Sikh Temporal Affairs), Other dietary Sikh practices include Sarbloh Bibek, which translates literally to "all-iron lifestyle", and consists of the use of only iron utensils and strictly eating food prepared by the Khalsa Sikhs.
Disagreement with the ruling.
Some religious sects of Sikhism—Damdami Taksal, Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Namdharis, Guru Nanak Nishkam Sewak Jatha and the 3HO—believe that the Sikh diet should be meat-free.
The Akhand Kirtani Jatha dispute the meaning of the word "kutha", claiming it means all meat. However, in mainstream Sikhism this word has been accepted to mean that which has been prepared according to Muslim rituals.
Guru Granth Sahib.
Sikh intellectuals believe that the issue of meat and vegetarianism is addressed in one section only of the "Guru Granth Sahib":
On the view that eating vegetation would be eating flesh, Guru Nanak states:
On vegetation, the Guru Granth Sahib described it as living and experiencing pain:
The first Sikh Guru—Nanak Dev—said it was pointless to debate the merits of either not eating or eating meat in the context of religion, as maintaining a strict diet does not make one blessed or elevate one to a superior status over another, spiritually or otherwise. Being a member of a religion incorporates not only one's dietary customs, but the entire way in which devotees govern their lifestyle. He advocated a lifestyle consisting of honest, hard work and humility, focus and remembrance of God, and compassion for all of humanity and all of God's creation. These three key principles take precedence over one's dietary habits.
Langar.
Within the gurdwara, the Guru ka Langar (Guru's community kitchen) serves purely lacto-vegetarian food because the Langar is open to all. Since people of many faiths with varying dietary taboos, and since Sikhs accept these restrictions and accommodate people regardless of their faith or culture, the Sikh Gurus adopt vegetarian food for Langar. Meat was included in langar at the time of Guru Angad, but was discontinued to accommodate Vashnavites. The exception to vegetarian langar today is when Nihangs serve meat on the occasion of Holla Mohalla, and call it Maha Prashad.
Reincarnation.
Sikhism argues that the soul can possibly undergo millions of transformations as various forms of life before ultimately becoming human. These life forms could be a rock, vegetation, or an animal. Sikhism does not see a difference between these types of existence, however the human has a privileged position compared to other life forms. In terms of the Sikh view of karma, human life is seen as being most precious, and animal, vegetable, and mineral all viewed as being equally below human life. Therefore Sikhs view eating an animal is the same as eating a plant or mineral.
The Sikh code of conduct on the Sikh diet (Rehat Maryada).
According to the Sikh code of conduct or Rehat Maryada, Sikhs are not bound to be meat-free. The general consensus is that Sikhs are free to choose whether or not to include meat in their diet.
The "Rehat Maryada" states that Sikhs are bound to avoid meat that is killed in a ritualistic manner such as Halal (Muslim) or Kosher (Jewish).
Sikh intellectual views.
I. J. Singh states that throughout Sikh history, there have been many subsects of Sikhism that have espoused vegetarianism. However, this was rejected by the Sikh Gurus. Sikhs consider that vegetarianism and meat-eating are unimportant in the realm of Sikh spirituality. Surinder Singh Kohli links vegetarianism to Vashnavite behaviour. Gopal Singh, commenting on meat being served in the langar during the time of Guru Angad Gyani Sher Singh—who was the head priest at the Darbar Sahib—notes that ahimsa does not fit in with Sikh doctrine. W. Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi comment that if the Sikh Gurus had made an issue on vegetarianism, it would have distracted from the main emphasis of Sikh spirituality. H. S. Singha and Satwant Kaur comment on how ritually-slaughtered meat is considered a sin for initiated Sikhs. G. S. Sidhu also notes that ritually-slaughtered meat is taboo for a Sikh. Gurbakhsh Singh comments on how non-Kutha meat is acceptable for the Sikhs. Surinder Singh Kohli comments on the "fools wrangle over flesh" quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib by noting how Guru Nanak mocked hypocritical vegetarian priests. Gobind Singh Mansukhani states how vegetarianism and meat-eating has been left to the individual Sikh. Devinder Singh Chahal comments on the difficulties of distinguishing between plant and animal in Sikh philosophy. H. S. Singha comments in his book how the Sikh Gurus ate meat. Khushwant Singh also notes that most Sikhs are meat-eaters and decry vegetarians as daal khorey (lentil-eaters).
Historical dietary behaviour of Sikhs.
There are a number of eyewitness accounts from European travelers as to the eating habits of Sikhs. Although there is no prohibition on Sikhs eating beef, it is clear that Sikhs avoided eating it as a mark of respect for their Hindu neighbours. To initiate Muslims into their mysteries, one traveler said the Sikhs would prepare a dish of hog's legs.
According to Dabistan e Mazhib (a contemporary Persian chronology of the Sikh Gurus), Guru Nanak did not eat meat, and Guru Arjan thought that meat eating was not in accordance with Nanak's wishes. This differs from I. J. Singh's research that states that Guru Nanak ate meat on the way to Kurukshetra. According to Persian records, Guru Hargobind (the 6th Guru) ate meat and hunted, and his practice was adopted by most Sikhs.
Bhai Gurdas—a contemporary of the sixth Sikh Guru—wrote vaars (poems or couplets) to describe the behaviour of Sikhs at that time. One of his vaars praises the merits of goat meat:
<poem>
"The proud elephant is inedible and none eats the mighty lion."
"Goat is humble and hence it is respected everywhere."
"On occasions of death, joy, marriage, yajna, etc only its meat is accepted."
"Among the householders its meat is acknowledged as sacred and with its gut stringed instruments are made."
"From its leather the shoes are made to be used by the saints merged in their meditation upon the Lord."
"Drums are mounted by its skin and then in the holy congregation the delight-giving kirtan, eulogy of the Lord, is sung."
"In fact, going to the holy congregation is the same as going to the shelter of the true Guru."
</poem>
Sarbloh Bibek.
Many Sikhs keep Sarbloh Bibek. "Sarbloh" means all-iron and "Bibek" meaning conscious principles. Sikhs who follow this practice eat from iron bowls and iron plates only. According to Sarbloh Bibek, food must be cooked in iron cauldrons or other iron utensils while reciting Gurbani or Simran (meditating). Sikhs traditionally use sand to clean the iron utensils, but today Sikhs speed up the process using a mixture of dishwashing soap, sand, water, and a steel wool soap pad.
Another key aspect to maintaining Sarbloh Bibek is that Sikhs must only eat food prepared by other Amritdhari (baptized) Sikhs. Amritdhari Sikhs are also not to eat Jootha food (previously eaten food) from non-Amritdharis.
Sarbloh was used by Guru Gobind Singh to prepare Amrit during the Khalsa initiation ceremony in 1699. The Khanda (a double edged knife or sword) was also made of Sarbloh. To this day Amrit Sanchar ceremonies are conducted using a bata (bowl) and Khanda (sword) made of sarbloh.

(December 13, 1901 in Parma, Italy – December 17, 1999 in Rome) was a Roman Catholic Jesuit cardinal who led the Pontifical Gregorian University during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII, whom he aided in the preparation of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary. He was confessor to Pope Paul VI and Paul's successor, Pope John Paul I, and was a teacher of Pope John Paul I's successor, Pope John Paul II.
In 1981, after then Superior General Pedro Arrupe suffered a debilitating stroke, Pope John Paul II appointed Dezza and an assistant, then-Father (later Archbishop) Giuseppe Pittau, S.J., to head the Jesuit order. In 1991, Dezza was named a cardinal by Pope John Paul II out of gratitude for his services to the Church in the management of the crisis and for his work as a theologian and university president. Pope John Paul II personally conducted the Mass of Christian Burial for the funeral of Paolo Dezza on December 20, 1999.
Aged seventeen, Dezza entered the Jesuit order on December 2, 1918. He studied both in Madrid, Spain Naples, Italy and Innsbruck, Austria. On March 25, 1928, he was ordained priest. A brilliant scholar, he was named professor of philosophy at the Gregorian University, but had to spent several years in Switzerland because of health complications. In 1935, he was named Provincial for the region Venice and Milan, and in 1941, he was named head of the Gregorian University With Robert Leiber, Augustin Bea, Otto Faller, G. Hentrich and R. G. de Moos he assisted in the preparation of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary. 
In 1945, he baptized Israel Zolli, the Chief Rabbi of Rome and head of the Jewish community, who, in recognition of the interventions of Pope Pius XII for the Jews in Rome during German occupation, took on the name Eugenio Zolli. Eugenio Zolli worked for the rest of his life in the Gregorian University. Dezza was said to be a leading candidate in the election for a new Jesuit General in 1946. From 1951 on he headed as General Secretary the International Federation of Catholic Universities (FIUC). He was confessor to two popes, Paul VI and John Paul I. He arrived at the Vatican every Friday evening at seven P.M. The only words he ever spoke about his long service to Pope Paul VI during his pontificate were, "that this pope is a man of great joy." 
After the death of Pope Paul VI, Dezza was more outspoken, saying that "if Paul VI was not a saint, when he was elected Pope, he became one during his pontificate. I was able to witness not only with what energy and dedication he toiled for Christ and the Church but also and above all, how much he suffered for Christ and the Church. I always admired not only his deep inner resignation but also his constant abandonment to divine providence.".
In 1981, the Jesuit Superior General, Pedro Arrupe, suffered a stroke. The Jesuits nominated its Vicar General, the Rev. Vincent O'Keefe, an American, to run the order until a successor could be found. The Pope, in a highly unusual decision intervened and appointed instead Father Dezza, as a special pontifical delegate to serve as the Jesuits' interim leader. The Pope knew Dezza personally as his teacher. As a student in the Belgian College in Rome after the war, he had attended Dezza's lectures at the Pontifical Gregorian University. In 1983, at its 33rd General Congregation, the Jesuits elected Peter Hans Kolvenbach, a Dutch academic as their new Superior General on the first ballot.
The Pope elevated Father Dezza, aged 90, to cardinal in 1991 as Cardinal-Deacon of "S. Ignazio di Loyola a Campo Marzio". In 1999, the Pope personally celebrated the funeral mass and gave a moving homily of Cardinal Dezza in which he said:
Cardinal Paolo Dezza is buried in the Church of Sant'Ignazio in Rome, near the grave of St. Robert Bellarmine.

The Ga Ga's

The Ga Ga's (often spelled as The*Ga*Ga*s) were a hard rock band formed by Tommy Gleeson in 2002. Following the band's demise in 2006, three of the band's members would go on to form Slaves to Gravity. Throughout the band's career, they supported Velvet Revolver, The Wildhearts, Skid Row, Whitesnake, Andrew WK, spud gun frenzy, The Lee Rodgers Experience, 5ive and The Red Hot Chili Pipers
During an interview with the band in 2005, Gleeson states that: "We’re not the kind of band that if one left, we’d just get another guy in. It’s about us as five guys, our styles and who we are as people, especially Andy Brass who rocks snow wash denim better than any man ever could. There’s no replacement member, that’s how we knew the band was strong." On June 1, 2006 the following appeared on the band's MySpace: In May, when Rob left the band to nosh off Brian May, we had undoubtedly reached a crossroads in our lives. The constant set-backs and let-downs of the last 12 months had left us all feeling exhausted and disillusioned, and we knew that to survive, something had to change. We've looked deep into ourselves and come to the conclusion that now is the time to begin again. We've had 4 amazing years as THE*GA*GA*S, learning a lot about the way things really work in this business, and sharing our music and our lives with you all. None of us would change this experience for the world, and we thank every single one of you who has supported us throughout. We are forever indebted.
In 2005, the band were nominated for a Kerrang! award for 'Best British Newcomer', an award Slaves to Gravity would go on to win in 2008.
In 2013 Willis was banned from pro snooker during a betting scandal, but has since become the face of Ray Gray pork scratchings.

Men's 200 metres world record progression

The following table shows the world record progression in the men's 200 metres, as ratified by the IAAF. The current record of 19.19 seconds was set by Usain Bolt at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics.
The IAAF maintained separate records for 200 m over a straight track and over a curved track. It discarded records for the former after 1976. The IAAF ratified the first record for 200 m (bend) in 1951. "y" denoted times for 220 yards (201.17 m) which were also ratified for the event.
To June 21, 2011, the IAAF has ratified 24 world records in the event.
Records 1951–1976.
(+) plus sign denotes en route time during longer race
John Carlos ran 19.7 seconds (19.92 auto) (1.9 ms wind), at altitude, at the 1968 US Olympic Trials in Echo Summit. The run was not ratified as a world record because Carlos was wearing shoes with 'brush' spikes which did not have sanction as official footwear.
Records post-1977.
Beginning in 1975, the IAAF accepted separate automatically electronically timed records for events up to 400 metres. Starting on January 1, 1977, the IAAF required fully automatic timing to the hundredth of a second for these races. 
Tommie Smith's 1968 Olympic gold medal victory was the fastest recorded fully electronic 200 metre sprint up to that time. 
The best automatic times at low altitude were 20.00 seconds by Borzov at Munich in 1972, then 19.96 (Mennea, 1980), 19.75 (Carl Lewis, 1983) and 19.73 (Mike Marsh, 1992), before Michael Johnson ran 19.66 in 1996.

List of UEFA Intertoto Cup winners

The UEFA Intertoto Cup was a European association football competition, held during the summer for European clubs that have failed to qualify for either the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Cup. It provided "an alternative qualifying route into the UEFA Cup". The tournament did not come under official UEFA sanction until 1995, and was abolished in 2009.
The first tournament provided two winners, both of whom therefore qualified for the UEFA Cup in the 1995–96 season, with Strasbourg and Bordeaux as the winning teams. From the following season to the 2005 contest, three teams were awarded Intertoto Cups, with French teams being the most successful. In 2006, the format was modified to allow eleven clubs to qualify for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup, with the Intertoto Cup being awarded to the team that progressed the farthest in the competition. The competition was originally played over two legs, one at each participating club's stadium.
Hamburg, Villarreal, Schalke 04 and Stuttgart hold the record for the most victories, with each team winning the competition twice. The only teams to retain the UEFA Intertoto Cup are Villarreal and Schalke 04, who both retained the cup in 2004 after winning the previous year. Teams from France have won the competition on the most occasions, with 12 winners coming from the country.
Notes.
A. Newcastle United won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006, after progressing the farthest out of the 11 teams that qualified for the UEFA Cup via the UEFA Intertoto Cup. The match shown represents the final match in the Intertoto Cup.

Mount Bohemia

Mount Bohemia (Coordinates: ) is a ski resort located near Lac La Belle, Michigan, in the northern Keweenaw peninsula. Mount Bohemia operates two chairlifts, and offers the highest vertical drop in the Midwest with 900 feet from the top of the peak to the base of the resort. The resort has 95 runs and first opened for business in 2000.
Mount Bohemia does not operate any snow making equipment and relies on its 250 to 300 inch year average of lake effect snow, the most seen at any resort in the Midwest. Because runs are not groomed, Mount Bohemia is not an appropriate resort for beginners. It offers mostly black diamonds, as well as double and even triple black diamond runs.

Chinese Jia-A League 1994

The 1994 Chinese Jia-A League season is the inaugural season of professional association football and the 33rd top-tier overall league season held in China. The league was expanded to twelve teams and started on April 17, 1994 and ended on November 13 with Dalian Wanda winning the championship.
Overview.
By the start of the 1994 league season the Chinese Football Association had been demanding full professionalism since 1992, this meant that private businesses were allowed to own or sponsor football clubs for the first time. The Chinese FA would also sell the television rights to CCTV for 450,000 Yuan and gain sponsorship for the league from Marlboro. Clubs were awarded with a 700,000 Yuan season appearance fee which saw the average monthly players wages jump up significantly from 100 Dollars to 2000 Dollars. With better wages clubs could now transfer professional foreign players except for Bayi who because they're part of the People's Liberation Army had to have active military members. The league was also expanded to twelve teams compared to eight from the previous season, while the four teams promoted came from the Chinese Jia-A League 1992 league season because there was no promotion or relegation held in the Chinese Jia-A League 1993 league season. By the end of the season Dalian Wanda won their first ever championship while Shenyang Liuyao and Jiangsu Maint were relegated at the end of the season.
Name changes.
With clubs now professional units they were allowed to gain sponsorship and would often change the clubs names to accommodate the sponsor. Below is a list of the dates on when the clubs officially became professional as well as when they gained their first sponsor and changed their name to accommodate this.

Hebert Box

A Hebert Box (pronounced AY-bear, also known as Hebert's Box) is one of two regions of the tropical Atlantic Ocean that are useful as predictors of hurricanes that will strike South Florida, USA. They are named for former National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center forecaster Paul Hebert, who observed in the late 1970s that most strong hurricanes (characterized as those with winds exceeding ) which had struck South Florida since 1900 had also passed through one of these two small 335-mile-by-335-mile (517-km-by-517-km) square geographic regions.
Examples include unnamed hurricanes in 1926, 1928, 1933, and 1935, as well as the major hurricanes Donna and Betsy, all of which came through an Hebert Box. Collectively these storms killed more than 2,000 people in Florida. Conversely, storms such as the major hurricanes Floyd and Gert in 1999, which both were headed for Florida at one point, missed the Hebert Boxes and turned away from Florida at the last minute.
Location.
The first Hebert Box is located east of Puerto Rico over the US Virgin Islands, between 15° and 20° north latitude and 60° to 65° west longitude. This was the first area that Hebert discovered, and provides an indication for the behavior of Cape Verde type storms, which form off of the western coast of Africa near the islands of the same name. This first box is useful for storms that typically form in the early part of the Atlantic hurricane season (June through early September).
The second Hebert Box is located over the Cayman Islands between 15° and 20° north latitude and 80° to 85° west longitude. This was the second discovered, and provides an indication for the behavior of storms that will move north to hit Florida. These are usually late-season storms that form in this region in late September and October, and this box is mostly concerned with them.
As predictors.
The geography of the Hebert Boxes is the key to their use as predictors. The boxes are located such that hurricanes have plenty of space to intensify after passing through them, and the prevailing winds tend to push them towards Florida. Conversely, if they pass outside the box they are either too close to land to intensify much, or are far enough away from land that they are more subject to the influences of steering winds and other atmospheric conditions. These tend to either push the hurricane more westward across the Caribbean Sea towards the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, or into the Gulf of Mexico where they threaten Mexico and the Gulf Coast states, or eastwards causing them to curve outwards over the Atlantic and miss landfall altogether.
While these boxes provide an indication that a hurricane may threaten South Florida, a hurricane does not have to pass through one to strike there, as were the case with the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Andrew, though the latter did skirt the edges of the eastern box. Additionally, a hurricane which does pass through a Hebert Box can very easily miss Florida, or indeed any landfall entirely. Hebert himself acknowledged that the boxes are not a guarantee of hurricane landfall either way, but cautions that if a hurricane passes through one, "really, really pay attention. We worry plenty in August and September when one goes through that box, and we have a certain comfort level when one misses the box."

Before the league started it was dogged by rumours of match fixing when it was discovered that second tier club and promotion hopeful Changchun Yatai had fixed a match on October 6, 2001 against Zhejiang in their favour. When these allegations turned out to be true Changchun Yatai were denied promotion into the league as their punishment, which meant there would only be 15 teams performing within the league. Also before the season started it was decided that because the Chinese national team had qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup there would be no relegation so the players would not be distracted with the fear of demotion.

Chinese Jia-A League 2003

The 2003 Chinese Jia-A League season is the tenth season of professional association football and the 42nd top-tier overall league season in China. The league started on March 15 and ended on November 30, 2003 while in preparation for the rebranded Chinese Super League three teams were relegated at the end of the season. 
Shanghai Shenhua finished as champions, however they were later retrospectively stripped of the title on 19 February 2013 for match-fixing. Runners-up Shanghai International were also surrounded in their own match-fixing controversy, which saw several of their players taking bribes. Despite the club itself not being implicated in these crimes the season's title was not awarded to any club.
Overview.
The 2003 Chinese Jia-A League season was the last season before it was rebranded as the Chinese Super League by the Chinese Football Association and had 15 teams, with one team provided a bye for each round. Three teams were relegated at the end of the season; however, relegation was based on an averaging system using the last seasons and this season's final position.
At the end of the season, Shanghai Shenhua narrowly won the championship against their local neighbours Shanghai International. Critics would dispute the legitimacy of the title win after it was discovered in 2011 that the Shenhua General manager Lou Shifang bribed the head of the Chinese Football Association referee arrangements Zhang Jianqiang and referee Lu Jun 350,000 yuan each to be bias towards Shenhua in a vital match against Shanghai International in a game that Shenhua won 4–1. While all three men were officially charged with match-fixing, the club was spared any disciplinary action and were allowed to keep the title with the reason provided by the Chinese football association for the leniency being that they would be punishing the individuals who put the game in disrepute and not the club, because Lou Shifang was Shenhua's offending participant and had left the club several years before the allegations were confirmed it would have been harsh to punish the club retrospectively. On 18 February 2013, The CFA decided to change its mind on Shenhua and retrospectively decided to punish the club by revoking its 2003 league title, fining the club 1 million yuan and giving a 6-point deduction at the beginning of the 2013 Chinese Super League season after it was discovered that they also fixed another game against Shaanxi Guoli F.C. en route to winning the 2003 league title. Shanghai International, however were not retrospectively awarded the title after it was officially confirmed on June 13, 2012 that the Shanghai International players Shen Si, Qi Hong, Jiang Jin and Li Ming (1975) took a bribe from former Tianjin Teda F.C. general manager Yang Yifeng to lose their November 30, 2003 game, which saw all offending participants fined and jailed for their crimes as well as the Chinese FA deciding that Tianjin should also face a 1 million Yuan and 6-point deduction at the beginning of the 2013 Chinese Super League season. 
Also within the season Chongqing Lifan F.C. were relegated at the end of the campaign; however, they were allowed to remain within the division for next season when they bought Yunnan Hongta's registration and merged the two clubs together. While at the end of the campaign saw the loss of August 1st football club who were relegated and decided to disband at the end of the season. The club who were the sport branch of the People's Liberation Army had been in existence for over fifty years and were one of the most successful clubs in Chinese history during the amateur era; however because all the players had to be active military members and paid accordingly made it impossible for them to compete with the other clubs who were now also paying professional wages to their players, which also saw the club struggle within the professional era and lead to the clubs disbandment.
Relegation.
Chinese Super League qualification was based on the average positioning of the teams from the 2002 and 2003 league standings.

Good-Time Girl

Good-Time Girl is a 1948 British drama film directed by David MacDonald. The film was based on Arthur La Bern's novel "Night Darkens the Street".
Plot.
The film opens with Miss Thorpe, the chairman of the Juvenile court, giving advice to troubled teenager Lyla Lawrence. Miss Thorpe tells Lyla that her life has a similar beginning to that of Gwen Rawlings.
Gwen Rawlings was a teenage girl who continually fell into the wrong crowd. Gwen's first troubles began with her employer who caught her "borrowing" a brooch from his pawnshop. Though Gwen had only borrowed it to use for a dance and had every intention of returning it, she was fired. When she arrived home and informed her father, he beat her. The next day Gwen packed her things and moved into a boarding house. There, she met Jimmy, a sharp-dressed man who immediately took a liking to her.
Jimmy found her a job at the Blue Angel Nightclub where she was employed as a hat-check girl. While working, she met Red, a bandmember for the club who felt the need to look after her well-being. Jimmy attempted to pursue Gwen but was rejected. He grew extremely angry towards the growing relationship between Red and Gwen and later beat her. Max Vine, his employer at the club, discovered Jimmy's crime and fired him. Angry at Gwen, who he felt had lost him his job, Jimmy began to plot to set her up. He stole their landlady's jewellery and told Gwen to pawn it for him. Believing that the jewelry belonged to his mother, Gwen followed his instructions. Later, after learning that Max had been attacked by a gang, Gwen implored Red to allow her to stay the night at his place. Red permitted her a night's stay but insisted that she leave the following day as it was unsuitable for a young girl to live with him.
However, the police soon found Gwen and she was sent to court where she was accused of having stolen jewellery. Miss Thorpe presided over the hearing and decided to sentence her to a reform school for three years. During a school fight, Gwen runs away and finds Max who has opened another club. Max is reluctant to take her back but due to her desperation, he gives her a job. Gwen soon becomes close to Danny Martin, a regular at the club. One drunken night both are out a for a drive when they accidentally hit and kill a police officer. Danny Martin forbids anyone from speaking to the police. However, once Danny is questioned, Gwen flees.
Danny later finds Gwen and beats her. Gwen is found and helped by two American soldiers who are AWOL. They decide to band together and become robbers in London. After becoming too well known in London for their crimes, they decide to head to Manchester. As they flag down a car to steal, Gwen realizes that the driver of the car is Red. When her companions realize the two recognize each other, they shoot Red dead. All three are eventually caught for their crimes and Gwen is currently serving fifteen years in prison.
At the end of the film, Lyla thanks Miss Thorpe and decides to head home.

Anthony Obinna

Anthony Uzodimma Obinna ( – ), born in Umuelem Enyiogugu in Aboh Mbaise, (local government area of Imo State, Owerri) in Nigeria, was the first convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Nigeria.
Obinna's family were followers of a tribal religion but while still young Obinna became a Christian. He became employed as a school teacher.
In 1965, Obinna had a vision in which Jesus Christ showed him rooms in a beautiful building. In 1971, he found an article in "Readers Digest" which had a picture of this building and he discovered it was the Salt Lake Temple of the LDS Church.
He contacted the headquarters of the church and received literature. The church informed him that it had no plans to send missionaries to Nigeria. However, Obinna organized an unofficial congregation of the church while waiting to be baptized a member of the church. In 1978, after the LDS Church lifted its restriction on black people holding the priesthood, Mormon missionaries travelled to Nigeria and baptized Obinna and a number of other converts. Immediately after his baptism, he was ordained a priest and appointed to be the branch president. It is thought that Obinna was the first black person to serve in that office in the church; certainly he was the first black man to serve in such an office in Africa.
After his ordination to the priesthood, Obinna baptized his wife Fidelia. She served as the first black Relief Society president in Africa. Obinna and his wife were sealed in the Logan Utah Temple in 1989.

Ala-Too Square (, ; , ) is the central square in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The square was built in 1984 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Kyrgyz SSR, at which time a massive statue of Lenin was placed in the square's center. The statue of Lenin was moved in 2003 to a smaller square in the city, and a new statue called "Erkindik" (Freedom) was installed in its place.
The square serves as a place for state events and celebrations. In 2008, it was the site of a memorial ceremony for world-renowned Kyrgyz writer Chinghiz Aitmatov.
On March 24, 2005, the square was the site of the largest anti-government protest of Kyrgyzstan's Tulip Revolution. After several weeks of unrest throughout the country, over 15,000 people gathered early in the afternoon to protest the results of the 2005 parliamentary elections. Two people were killed and over 100 wounded when the protesters clashed with government officials. However, the protesters soon took control of the square, and stormed the White House, forcing Askar Akayev, Kyrgyzstan's first president, to flee the country and later resign from office.

1969–70 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1969-70 campaign saw Town crowned as champions of Division 2. They outclassed the rest of the division and finished 7 points clear of 2nd placed Blackpool. Town's team were largely unchanged for most of the season, with 7 members of the team (Dennis Clarke, Roy Ellam, Geoff Hutt, Jimmy McGill, Jimmy Nicholson, Terry Poole and Frank Worthington) played every league match that season. They gained promotion to the 1st Division for the first time since the 1955-56 season.
Review.
Following a successful end to the previous season, many were hoping that Town could possibly mount a serious promotion challenge to Division 1. A good start to the season followed with 3 wins from the first 3 games against Oxford United, Aston Villa and Preston North End. A loss at Leeds Road against Blackburn Rovers would be Town's only home defeat of the season, but following another loss against Queens Park Rangers saw Town stumble slightly, but they then went on a run of 1 loss in 13 matches, which saw Town climb to the summit of the table in November, but an indifferent spell in December saw Town slip to third by the end of the yeay, which then saw Town only lose one more league match during the season.
Amongst the impressive statistics from the season, Town used only 15 players during the league season and 7 of them (Clarke, Ellam, Hutt, McGill, Nicholson, Poole and Worthington) played every match. Town clinched promotion with a 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough, which was followed up by a 2-0 win at Blackburn Rovers, which clinched the title, the first trophy they had won since winning the Division 1 title for the third time, back in 1926. They finished the season 60 points, 7 clear of 2nd placed Blackpool.

Storm Over the Nile

Storm Over the Nile is a 1955 film adaptation of the novel "The Four Feathers", directed by Terence Young. The film not only extensively used footage of the action scenes from the 1939 film version stretched into CinemaScope, but exactly the same screenplay, almost line-for-line also then directed by Zoltan Korda as well as several pieces of music by the original composer Miklos Rozsa. It featured Anthony Steel, Laurence Harvey, James Robertson Justice, Mary Ure, Ian Carmichael, Michael Hordern and Christopher Lee. The film was shot on location in the Sudan.
Plot.
The film depicts Harry Faversham, a sensitive child who is terrified by his father and his Crimean War friends relating tales of cowardice that often ended in suicide. Young Harry follows his father's wishes of being commissioned in the Royal North Surrey Regiment. He also becomes engaged to marry the daughter of his father's friend General Burroughs.
A year after his father's death, the North Surreys are given orders to deploy to the Sudan Campaign to join General Kitchener's forces to avenge General Gordon's death at Khartoum. Disgracefully, Harry resigns his commission on the eve of his regiment's departure, whereupon, as symbols of cowardice, he receives a white feather from each of three fellow officers and from his fiancé as well, comprising the famous four feathers.
Unable to live as a coward, Harry contacts a sympathetic friend of his father's, Dr. Sutton, to obtain his help and contacts to join the campaign in the Sudan. Meeting Dr. Sutton's friend Dr Harraz in Egypt, Harry is disguised as a member of a tribe that had their tongues cut out for their treachery by the supporters of the Mahdi. The tribe is identified with a brand that Harry undergoes as well as dyeing his skin colour. The extreme disguise is done to disguise the fact that he cannot speak Arabic or any other native language.
Following as a native worker, Harry follows his old company who have been sent independently from the main force as a distraction to the enemy. His former comrade and romantic rival Captain Durrance loses his helmet on a reconnaissance patrol. He is unable to retrieve it or move from a position facing the sun as a result of Sudanese searching for him. The hours forced to look at the hot sun destroy the nerves of his eyes, making him blind.
Harry warns the company of the enemy's night assault but he is knocked unconscious. His company is wiped out with Harry's former friends, the subalterns Burroughs and Willoughby captured by the enemy and imprisoned in Omdurman. Harry plays mute with the blind Durrance to take him to British lines, then enters Omdurman to find his old friends.
Subsequent plot pertains to the outcome of the specific four feathers & the heroic parties involved.
Production.
Kenneth More says Alex Korda offered him a lead role in the movie but he turned it down to appear in "The Deep Blue Sea" (1955) instead.

In 1566, Millalemo led the attack on the recently rebuilt Cañete. In 1569, he was a leader under Llanganabal in the Battle of Catirai.
He is said to have died in 1570 and ordered his body to be burned, so that he might rise up into the clouds and keep up the war against the dead Spaniards whom he expected to find there.

Heather Fell

Heather Fell (born 3 March 1983 in Plymouth, England) is a British modern pentathlete. She competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics, winning the silver medal in the women's modern pentathlon event.
Early life.
Fell grew up in Tavistock, Devon, where she was taught to ride and shoot, both disciplines in the pentathlon, by the parents of the 2000 Olympic pentathlon bronze medallist Kate Allenby. Heather has a degree in physiotherapy from Brunel University.
Career.
After initial success at junior level, including two gold and one silver medal in the 2003 World Junior Championships in Athens, Fell nearly gave up the sport in 2006 when, due to a series of shin splint injuries, her funding was cut by UK Sport. She described this as giving her "the kick up the arse I needed", and, forced to stop training at the University of Bath's facilities due to the cost of living in the city, she moved back home with her parents, funding her continued training with three part-time jobs; as a swimming coach, a barmaid and a physiotherapist. Her funding was not restored until she qualified for the Olympics.
2007 brought her first medal success in a World Cup event, with bronze in Moscow. Fell won an individual silver medal at the 2007 European Championships in Riga, reaching the Olympic qualifying standard in doing so. She also won a gold medal as part of the relay team, with Katy Livingston and Georgina Harland.
In 2008 Fell won medals at two events on the World Cup circuit, gold at Millfield and bronze in Kladno. In Kladno she went into the final discipline, the run, in 5th place, but moved up two positions with a personal best, she had also set a PB in the swimming. At the World Championships, in Budapest, she finished just outside of the medals in 4th place in the individual event but picked up silver medals as a member of the squads in team event, with Georgina Harland and Mhairi Spence, and team relay event, with Katy Livingston and Spence. In January 2014 Fell announced her retirement to pursue a career in media. 
2008 Olympic Games.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics, in Beijing, Fell won the silver medal in the women's individual event, behind Lena Schoneborn of Germany. In the first discipline, the air pistol shooting, she scored 185 out of a possible 200, this corresponded to 1156 points and 6th place. Results of 880 points in the fencing, 1328 points in the freestyle swimming, and 1144 points in the show jumping followed, leaving her in 2nd position, with a 19 second deficit on leader Schoneborn, heading into the 3000 m run. Fell completed the run in 10 minutes 19.24 seconds, a time worth 1244 points, giving her a final total of 5752 points. Despite closing the gap on Schoneborn by 9 seconds she was unable to catch her and take victory. She said after the medal ceremony, "It's pretty obvious that I don't regret deciding to stick with it."

9ff GT9

The 9ff GT9 is a sports car based loosely on the Porsche 911, built by German tuning company 9ff, founded by Jan Fatthauer. Based on the Porsche 911 (997) GT3; the cars are extensively rebuilt and fitted with a heavily modified 4.0 litre flat 6 that produces , depending on the configuration. One of the major differences from a normal 911 is the positioning of the engine; whilst every 911 throughout Porsche's history (excluding the Porsche 911 GT1 racer) has been rear-engined, the GT9 is mid-engined for better weight distribution.
It takes the 9ff 3.8 seconds (from a rolling start) or 5.2 seconds (from a standing start) to reach , and 17.6 seconds to reach . The top speed of the original GT9 is . This was faster than the original Bugatti Veyron, but slower than both the SSC Ultimate Aero TT and the Bugatti Veyron SuperSport.
The interior of the car has been stripped out for lightness, and thus were very basic compared to a standard 911 Turbo. All GT9s had blue leather, square patterned trim, with a roll cage for safety.
9ff stated that only 150 GT9s would be produced, and only 20 of those would have the most powerful engine. Prices ranged between £150,000 and £540,000 depending on engine and options, with all of them already sold.

<doc id="18983527" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18983527" title="Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp.">
Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp.

Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp. (), is a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that state anti-usury laws regulating interest rates cannot be enforced against nationally chartered banks based in other states. Justice William Brennan wrote that it was clearly the intent of Congress when it passed the National Banking Act that nationally chartered banks would be subject only to federal regulation by the Comptroller of Currency and the laws of the state in which they were chartered, and that only Congress or the appropriate state legislature could pass the laws regulating them.
The case has been called one of the most important of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer credit cards to anyone in the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to export interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race to the bottom between U.S. states in an effort to attract lending institutions to set up shop in their states. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use of credit cards has vastly increased, and since the mortgage industry soon followed suit, the issuance of subprime mortgages also increased drastically, facilitating the housing bubble that led to the 2008 housing crisis.
Background of the case.
U.S. banking system and anti-usury laws.
During the Civil War, Congress enacted the National Bank Act, which allowed for nationally chartered banks as well as state-chartered ones and encouraged many existing banks to become national ones. It led to the standardization of U.S. currency and created a dual banking system that has existed ever since.
National banks were subject to regulation by the Comptroller of Currency but had to follow the laws of the states in which they were located. Among these statutes were anti-usury laws, which capped the rates at which banks were allowed to lend money, usually between 10 and 20 percent.
In the late 1970s, these created problems for some banks as the high inflation of that period resulted in them borrowing money at higher rates than they could lend it. In response to this asset liability mismatch, libertarians and free-market advocates called for interest rate caps to be increased or repealed entirely as an unreasonable restriction on market forces. Bills to do so were introduced in Congress and some state legislatures. Some succeeded in the former goal, but those that sought to eliminate interest rate caps entirely failed.
Credit cards.
The term "credit card" had been used and proposed by utopian author Edward Bellamy in his 1887 book "Looking Backward". The first realizations of this model came during the Depression with Chargaplate, meant to encourage customers to spend money by introducing an alternative to cash and checks. Diners Club evolved in the early 50s as the first credit card company.
In 1958, Bank of America had introduced BankAmeriCard (today's Visa), the first credit card on a revolving credit model, in which cardholders did not have to pay the full balance each month but merely a minimum payment if they so chose. It, like other banks in those days, tried to promote use of them by mailing cards, unsolicited, to multiple, sometimes randomly chosen, customers in a particular area.
"Fisher v. First of Omaha Service Corp.".
In 1969, one of these unsolicited cards, First National Bank of Omaha, came to Iowa resident Fred Fisher. He filed suit in the Southern District of Iowa against the Omaha bank on September 3, 1971, for exporting Nebraska's higher interest rates to his state. He alleged that since that state's legislature had fixed the usury ceiling at nine percent, First National was breaking the law by charging him twice that for an advance of up to $500.
On February 22, 1972, the court ordered the Fisher case be transferred to the U.S. District Court of Nebraska because the Omaha bank had "not waived its privilege of being sued in the district where it was established." In an opinion filed on June 24, 1975, the Nebraska court ruled that the interest rate which First National may legally charge in Iowa is governed by the usury laws of the state "where the extension of credit occurs" and that since the credit was extended in Omaha where the 18 percent interest rate was not usurious, it was entirely within the legal bounds in Iowa as well.
On November 1, 1974, the Iowa attorney general, Richard C. Turner, filed a petition with the District Court, requesting a permanent injunction enjoining the Omaha bank and a Des Moines bank from assessing or collecting a finance charge in excess of the amount permitted by the Iowa Consumer Credit Code. The court ruled in favor of the defendants. In 1977, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court in the Fisher case, saying that First National's card program should not be restrained or restricted in any way because it "promotes and facilitates, rather than limits or inhibits, interstate trade and commerce.
In Iowa, on August 30, 1978, the Iowa Supreme Court threw out the lower court decisions and ruled in favor of both Fisher and the attorney general. As a result, First National filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court on September 11 and hired Robert H. Bork, to argue its Minnesota case before the justices.
Marquette Bank.
At the same time, some residents of Minnesota were being offered cards by First National of Omaha, at similar terms. Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis, which was chartered in the state and also offering credit cards, confronted First National Bank of Omaha and informed them that what they were doing with the interest rate was illegal, since Minnesota's capped interest rates at 12 percent (without specifying what kind of debt). Marquette threatened to take the Omaha bank to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary if their practice continued. 
Marquette began to lobby for the passage of a state law designed to put a 12 percent ceiling on all bank credit card outstandings. In May 1976, about one month after that measure was signed into law, Marquette filed a suit in Hennepin County court to enjoin First Omaha from offering credit cards at the higher interest rate in Minnesota. It was first removed to federal court, where the judge sent it back to state court, which ruled in favor of Marquette. The Minnesota Supreme Court overturned that ruling on appeal.
Before the Court.
During oral argument, Justice Thurgood Marshall gave his analysis of the case. He asked the Marquette attorney if he was correct in stating that the citizens of Minnesota can go to their bank and get a credit card at 12 percent. The attorney agreed. Justice Marshall again asked the Marquette attorney if he was correct in stating that First National Bank of Omaha is sending mailing solicitations into his territory and signing up a large number of citizens. The attorney agreed. Finally, Justice Marshall asked the Marquette attorney, "You're claiming that the Omaha bank is taking customers away from Marquette?" The attorney agreed. Justice Marshall concluded that the bank does not have a legal problem, but that they have a marketing problem.
Decision.
On December 18, 1978, the high court, fully agreeing with Marshall's analysis, ruled unanimously in First National Bank's favor. The decision maintained that the 115-year-old National Bank Act takes precedence over usury statutes in individual states. Justice William Brennan wrote that the 1863 law permitted a national bank to charge interest at the rate allowed by the regulations of the state in which the lending institution is located.
Brennan rejected Marquette National's argument that just because First National was soliciting credit card customers in Minnesota, it was "located" in that state for purposes of the credit card program. "Minnesota residents were always free to visit Nebraska and receive loans in that state." It hadn't been suggested that Minnesota's laws would apply in that instance, he added. Therefore, they shouldn't be applied just because "the convenience of modern mail" allowed Minnesotans to get credit without having to visit Nebraska. He dismissed another of the plaintiffs' arguments, that the National Banking Act had also intended to preserve "competitive equality", between state and national banks by citing language from the original adoption of the statute and supporting documents to demonstrate that it was always Congress's intent to create a national banking system. The Court itself had taken notice of interstate lending as early as 1839, and the 1863 Congress, Brennan said, was equally aware of such transactions and did not wish to discourage them.
In the closing paragraph, he conceded one of the plaintiffs' arguments, that a ruling in First of Omaha's favor would make it difficult or impossible for states to enforce their anti-usury laws. But, he said, that had been the case since the National Banking Act was passed. "This impairment may in fact be accentuated by the ease with which interstate credit is available by mail through the use of modern credit cards," he allowed. "But the protection of state usury laws is an issue of legislative policy, and any plea to alter law to further that end is better addressed to the wisdom of Congress than to the judgment of this Court."
On July 25, 1979, the Iowa Supreme Court overturned their decision that was made on August 30, 1978.
Aftermath.
The decision attracted little notice at the time. Two years later, the possibilities it opened up became clearer when Citibank, squeezed by interest rate caps, decided to move its credit-card operations out of New York. The company persuaded Bill Janklow, then governor of South Dakota, whose agricultural economy was struggling at the time due to high fuel prices, to persuade that state's legislature to formally invite the bank there, as required by federal law before a national bank can do business from a state. He then successfully lobbied the legislators to pass a bill drafted by the bank that repealed the state's cap on interest rates, something a small group of legislators were already trying to do. Citibank quickly moved the 300 white-collar jobs in its credit-card division to Sioux Falls, where it has been ever since.
South Dakota lured a few more large credit operators, such as Wells Fargo, before corporation-friendly Delaware repealed its anti-usury laws as well. Several other states also repealed their interest-rate caps, more lenders entered the credit-card field and introduced newer products and by 1990 the amount of credit cards in use in the U.S. had more than doubled. Credit cards, once a loss leader for the banks that issued them, became a major profit center as banks aggressively marketed them to "revolvers", customers who carried large balances but rarely paid more than the monthly minimum, resulting in large interest payments to the bank
In the 1990s, Citibank's South Dakota operations would figure in a related Supreme Court case, "Smiley v. Citibank" (). This time state regulations on the late fees charged by credit-card issuers were challenged, and again the court ruled unanimously that they were also pre-empted by the National Banking Act, as interpreted by the Comptroller of Currency.
Criticism.
Critics and defenders of the credit-card industry have agreed that "Marquette Bank" opened the door for vast changes in how it does business. The former have often criticized the Court's ruling in the process.
"e effectively engaged in the single biggest policy change in the credit area, the whole consumer credit area, through an obscure Supreme Court decision interpreting some ambiguous language," Massachusetts senator and former Harvard Law professor Elizabeth Warren, a frequent critic of the consumer-credit industry. "In terms of changing our lives", says Chicago labor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan, "it may be the biggest case of our lifetimes."
"The effect was to gut every state law on usury", he says. The 1863 Congress, Geoghegan complains, couldn't have imagined credit cards when it passed the National Banking Act. He conceded that Brennan's opinion is technically right, but speculates that the justice thought Congress would step into the gap afterwards and enact a national credit-card rate cap, although that was politically unlikely at the time. In 1991 New York Senator Al D'Amato, a harsh critic of the credit-card industry, introduced a bill that would have capped credit card interest rates at 14% in response to a suggestion by President George H.W. Bush. His colleagues passed it overwhelmingly after half an hour of debate; the stock market fell as a result. It was never voted on in the House, and soon Congress focused on studying the industry's lending practices rather than capping interest rates.
Defenders of "Marquette Bank" point to increased competition in the credit card market as a positive result. "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, "Marquette" did not lay a foundation for runaway bank profits and consumer suffering," says George Mason University School of Law professor Todd Zywicki. "Rather, by eliminating archaic and largely ineffective usury restrictions, "Marquette" increased efficiency and competition in the credit card industry, made the market more responsive to consumer demand, and provided large benefits to consumers." Specifically, he cites the shift from retailer-issued credit to third-party bank credit as the biggest component of this change made possible.
On May 22, 2009, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the Credit CARD Act) was signed into law.

Scour Inc.

Scour Inc. was a multimedia search engine on the internet, and provided Scour Exchange, an early peer-to-peer file exchange service.
History.
Scour was founded by five students (Vince Busam, Michael Todd, Dan Rodriques, Jason Droege and Kevin Smilak) from the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in December 1997. By mid-1998 Ilya Haykinson and Travis Kalanick, also Computer Science students at UCLA joined the founding team. It moved into the spotlight a year later when in June of 1998, Scour received its first investment from former Disney president Michael Ovitz and Ron Burkle of Yucaipa companies.
The company's nice early products were an SMB search engine and Scour Media Agent, a Windows application to download files from SMB shares. The search engine would probe IP addresses for publicly shared files and then index them for download by other users.
In 1998, the company developed a web search engine as well, crawling the World Wide Web for links to multimedia audio, video and images.
In 1999 Scour received an investment from Michael Ovitz and the Yucaipa Company, an investment arm of the billionaire Ronald Burkle. Together, the total investment represented a controlling share in the company. After the investment, Scour expanded in terms of product offerings and personnel. The company launched a software product named MyCaster which allowed users to stream audio over the network, optionally mixing microphone input with an MP3 audio file in real time.
Faced with the increasing popularity of Napster, Scour developed a competing peer-to-peer service named Scour Exchange. Unlike Napster, the Scour software supported video and images in addition to just audio files, and integrated all users into one network. The company also tied its web site promotional materials to the Scour Exchange software and attempted to leverage its web and SMB indexes in providing additional search results inside the Scour Exchange application.
In the summer of 2000 the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) brought a lawsuit against Scour, alleging copyright infringement. Despite Scour's declarations of innocence, the company was not able to raise money to continue operations. They laid off most of its staff in September of that year and filed for bankruptcy protection, to protect itself from the lawsuit, shortly afterwards. The company's assets went up for auction and, following a bidding war, all assets were purchased by Centerspan Communications of Portland, Oregon in late December of that year.
Scour metasearch engine.
Scour has since relaunched in early 2008 as a metasearch engine combining the three most used search engines–Google, Yahoo and Live Search–into a single aggregated search page with social concepts. Scour rewards users with a point for each unique search conducted through the Scour Toolbar or at the website, as well as for commenting or rating a result (to a maximum of three points per search). Points can also be acquired through use of its affiliate program, with a matching 25% commission given to the host of the referral. Once users have accumulated a certain amount of points they can be redeemed for a Visa gift card or PayPal money transfer at an implied exchange rate of approximately USD$0.004 (2/5¢) a point. The rate for those not in its target demographic, however, is significantly less–only USD$0.0001 per point. The program was cancelled in the summer of 2009.
Scour redirect virus.
Since as early as 2009 a web browsing virus related to Scour surfaced. This virus hijacks the web browser being used and automatically redirects the user to Scour's search engine. Other websites have been reported to be redirected to as well with Scour being the primary one. The user's browser is redirected to scour.com after clicking a link, usually from Google.

Rustle the Leaf

Rustle the Leaf is an environmental comic strip that was published from November 2004 through July 2007, and is still available online through various environmental and earth science web sites. At the height of its distribution, the weekly comic was featured on over 70 Sierra Club Chapter and Group web sites, on the home pages of the U.S. and Canada Green Party web sites, on several college and university web sites, and on hundreds of environmental, natural products and science web sites around the world. From February 2005 through February 2007 the strip was the weekly comic feature on the web site for "Orion", a publication called "America's finest environmental magazine" by "The Boston Globe".
The strip's characters were created in late 2002 and early 2003 by Dave Ponce, a Central Indiana-based marketing consultant, and were proposed as a comic project to Steve and Melissa Zeitler, founders/owners of Citra-Solv, LLC., a manufacturer of natural, eco-friendly cleaning and personal care products. Ponce provided consulting and creative services to the Zeitlers, and believed their philosophy of sustainable lifestyle practices would resonate with a larger audience if presented in an engaging, humorous, noncommercial, less politically charged context. In January 2003 the Zeitlers agreed to fund the development of "Rustle the Leaf," and to make it available on their web site at www.citra-solv.com. Although Ponce had knowledge and experience writing environmental articles, and was a devoted follower of the comic strip medium, he did not have the art skills to draw Rustle the Leaf, and tapped friend and digital illustrator Corey Wilkinson to bring the characters to the page.
Development.
Early versions of Rustle the Leaf were developed as multi-panel strips that filled an 8.5 x 11 page. The cast of characters included "Rustle," the leaf of a Basswood tree, the title character and its most prominent personality. Rustle's comedic sidekick was "Rooty," an angry, wise-cracking acorn sprout. Also in the cast were 6 other characters: "Dandy" (a persecuted, paranoid Dandelion seed), "Fuego" (a firefly), "Paige" (a water drop), "Dizzy" (a helicoptering Silver Maple seed), "Professor Oakmont" (a sagacious Oak tree), and "Amelia" (an adventurous dragonfly). Wilkinson drew the strips digitally using Adobe Illustrator (vector-based) software. Editorial (character dialog and direction) was provided by Ponce. In this formative stage, the strip was directed toward children, and was therefore too broad and without nuance. It lacked the sharp edge, humor and intellect required to address diverse, complex, often serious environmental issues. Although several monthly strips were published on the Citra-Solv web site, and hundreds were downloaded for use in lesson plans and for other teaching purposes, "Rustle the Leaf" needed a more experienced, more credible creative engine to drive its art and editorial content. By May 2004 it was clear that Rustle the Leaf was not achieving Ponce's creative vision, nor Steve and Melissa Zeitler's distribution goals, and it was suspended until a more clearly defined direction could be established.
Six weeks after "Rustle the Leaf" production was suspended, Ponce contacted his friend Dan Wright, a seasoned, nationally proven comic strip creator, who's strip "Wildwood" was syndicated by King Features from 1998 through 2002. While "Wildwood" was in syndication, critics compared Wright’s comic strip panels—especially his nature scenes—to those of the legendary Walt Kelly. In late June 2004 Wright and Ponce began meeting in Muncie, Indiana several evenings each week to discuss the Rustle the Leaf project, and to develop a new creative direction for the strip.
During these development meetings, Wright's experience creating over 1,500 "Wildwood" strips provided the necessary context for how Rustle the Leaf should be approached. Wright's first priority was to address the "special world" in which the comic strip existed. He was uncomfortable with the mixing of plant and insect life in the cast, and believed the strip would be more successful if the characters were limited to the plant Kingdom—something fairly unique, and which would challenge Ponce and Wright creatively. Over weeks of development and discussion, the strip's cast was paired from 8 characters to 4, and Ponce and Wright began to iron out personality types and relationships among the remaining characters. The new version of "Rustle the Leaf" would include Rustle, Rooty, Dandy and Paige. The characters who would most frequently appear would be Rustle and Rooty. Dandy would appear in about a third of the strips, while Paige appeared only occasionally. Both Wright and Ponce had trouble relating to Paige, a character who's existence was due to a suggestion and sketch made by the Zeitler's pre-teen daughter (of the same name). Ponce (and then Wright) thought it made business sense to include the Paige character, and she appeared from time to time as an intellectual foil for Rustle and a personality foil for Rooty.
Once the cast and their relationships were established, Ponce and Wright began "playing with" their personalities, and Wright began recreating the characters visually. One of the reasons Wright was intrigued by the "Rustle" project was the strangeness of its characters—especially "Rooty," whom Ponce had conceived as an acorn with green "root-feet" appendages, and an oak frond shooting up from under its cap. "I saw that thing and thought: 'Wow--that's just nuts. It's one of the most original comic character ideas I've ever seen.'" Ponce cites a "watershed moment" for his enthusiasm with Wright's creative direction and artistic gifts. In one of his sketch books, Wright had drawn an early version of his interpretation of "Rooty," standing on one root-foot, gesturing with the other as he belted out an eco-conscious version of "Home on the Range." "At that moment," Ponce would later say, "I knew Dan and I were going to take 'Rustle the Leaf' someplace it deserved to go."
In August 2004 Melissa Zeitler met with Ponce and Wright at a Panera Bread location in Muncie, and the creators presented her with new character studies, new character personality profiles, and sample strips. Six days later, Steve and Melissa Zeitler contacted Ponce with the news that they would fund the new version of "Rustle the Leaf," which meant Dan Wright would leave his position at a local ad agency and work on "Rustle the Leaf" full time. Ponce would continue his other employment as a marketing consultant, but would donate 20 hours per week to the co-writing of the strip, research and writing of a monthly "Rustle the Leaf" lesson plan, and to the development and implementation of a new web site to feature the strip.
The Zeitler's formed a new corporation, "GO NATUR'L STUDIOS, LLC." in which they and Ponce owned stock. Following each year of Wright's employment, he would also earn stock in addition to his regular salary and bonuses. On September 1, 2004, GO NATUR'L STUDIOS, LLC. opened a small production studio/office in downtown Anderson, Indiana, on the third floor of the historic Union Building, located at the corner of Meridian and West 11th Street. Ponce drove from his home in Fishers, Indiana to Anderson 3 to 4 times each week, and the pair worked feverishly toward a comic strip and web site launch date of November 1, 2004. The goal was to have a "cushion" of 15 strips written, drawn, inked and colored by the launch date.<
Early Success.
For the two months during which Ponce and Wright worked to write and produce new strips, Ponce worked on creating a new Rustle the Leaf web site, and on researching, writing and producing monthly lesson plans for distribution from the site. In the evenings, Ponce began contacting hundreds of environmental activists, web sites and organizations—one by one—via email. In early October, one of Ponce's emails was forwarded from the owner of an environmental education web site to Ed Paynter, then the Chair of the national Sierra Club's volunteer Information and Technology Committee, who happened to live in nearby Indianapolis. Paynter called Ponce late one evening and asked how he could help get "Rustle the Leaf" to the masses. Paynter, a lifelong environmentalist, also happened to be a lifelong comic strip aficionado, and his enthusiasm and credibility within the greater environmental movement would lead to enormous opportunity. Chief among Paynter's accomplishments on behalf of "Rustle the Leaf" was the facilitating of an agreement between GO NATUR'L STUDIOS, LLC. and the Sierra Club national organization, which allowed all Sierra Club chapter and group web sites, newsletters and publications to use "Rustle the Leaf" comics and editorial content. It was the first agreement of its type between the Sierra Club and a third-party organization that was NOT a nonprofit. Paynter was also instrumental in introducing Ponce, Wright and Rustle to a broader base of environmentally conscious educational organizations and activists. By the November 1, 2004 launch date, dozens of environmental organizations were already linking to the weekly "Rustle the Leaf" comic feed on their web sites.
One of the priorities for the new "Rustle the Leaf" strip was to get print distribution, something the strip was never able to accomplish on a regular basis. Inquiries were made with traditional comic strip syndication groups and with members of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, with little success. One alternative newspaper, The Boulder Weekly, did carry the weekly strips for most of 2006, but little else emerged in the way of print opportunities. However, one highly respected, critically acclaimed publication, "Orion", had been looking for a comic feature for its web site, and Orion's Associate Editor, Peter Stiglin, contacted Ponce in December 2004 to inquire about web publication. In February 2005, Orion and GO NATUR'L STUDIOS reached an agreement through which Orion Online would publish a new Rustle the Leaf strip each week, for which GO NATUR'L STUDIOS would receive payment. Stiglin served as Orion's ongoing contact with Ponce and Wright, and also provided extremely valuable editorial critique and direction for the strip. Ponce said of Stiglin's involvement: "Peter was almost always spot-on with his suggestions for editing content, for--as he called it--'removing the extraneous.' He made 'Rustle the Leaf' a better strip, and challenged Dan and me to be better at what we were doing. If we submitted strips and Peter was enthusiastic, it made our week. If we submitted strips and Peter had insightful suggestions, it made us feel like someone 'had our back.'" Orion Online published "Rustle the Leaf" from March 2005 until August 2006, when the Orion editorial staff changed the mission of the web site. Not long after, Peter Stiglin left Orion to join a leading, New York-based book publishing company.
Rustle Becomes Semi-Famous.
Within 12 months of the re-launch of "Rustle the Leaf," organizations of every shape, size and political stripe were publishing the strip online, and were contacting Ponce and Wright about getting permission to use the strip in nonprofit newsletters, in educational presentations, in sales meetings and more. In October 2005, the online environmental publication "Grist" requested to use a "Rustle" strip, and then requested and published additional submissions from Ponce and Wright over the course of several months. In December 2005 a "Rustle the Leaf" holiday-themed strip was featured in a feature article at treehugger.com, one of the world's most-visited environmental consumer web sites. Visits to the "Rustle" site skyrocketed, and sites from around the globe began linking to "Rustle" content. In January, Ponce and Wright began producing the "Leave It Green Podcast," which featured fairly high production and editorial values, humorous banter between Ponce and Wright, and an interview with some leader or contributor to environmental causes or efforts. By March 2006 the "Leave It Green Podcast" was named "One of the World's 10 Best Environmental Podcasts" by treehugger.com. Monthly "Rustle the Leaf" web site hits grew into the hundreds of thousands; the highest month—March 2006—topped 750,000 hits. In the Spring of 2006 the Zeitlers funded production of 150,000 copies of "Rustle the Leaf's Earth Day Book," a 16-page educational book with comics, puzzles and games, aimed at elementary and middle school students. From their Connecticut offices, the Zeitlers distributed the books free of charge to educational and environmental organizations in the U.S. and Canada. Because news of the publication spread via the World Wide Web, requests for the copies of the book came in from organizations and nations around the world—including requests from the National Army of Pakistan, the Canadian government, a leading luxury hotel chain based in Indonesia, NASA's Langley Research Center, and an EPA regional office, which asked to be supplied with books anonymously for fear of reprisals from the Bush Administration. Sites linking to "Rustle the Leaf" weekly comics and monthly lesson plans continued to grow, but none of the distribution, notoriety or accolades for the strip was translating into capital to keep the venture going. The hope was that, with 150,000 Earth Day Books in the hands (and homes) of children, parents educators and government officials, "Rustle the Leaf" would see a significant boost in web site traffic and public notoriety following Earth Day 2006. Unfortunately, it was not to be, and the "Leave it Green Podcast" was discontinued in April 2006.
Economic Realities.
Much to the surprise (and chagrin) of the Zeitlers, Ponce and Wright, it became clear that—despite all the enthusiasm and acceptance for "Rustle the Leaf" among tens of thousands of readers worldwide—there was little opportunity for the strip to become self-supporting. The Zeitlers were enormously patient and generous in supporting Wright and (for a four months in 2006) also supporting Ponce, but all efforts to find additional sponsors, or a meaningful revenue stream, fell short. From the time the Zeitlers agreed to fund the original version of "Rustle" through the discontinuation of the strip in June 2007, the Zeitlers invested over $200,000 of their own money on the project. Thousands of phone calls, emails and other inquiries were made on "Rustle's" behalf; none of them ever generated a credible revenue stream.
One revenue possibility that was explored (and also funded by the Zeitlers) was the addition of one of the world's leading comic strip licensing experts, Bruce Cantrell, who was the head of licensing for Paws, Incorporated—the corporate entity behind Jim Davis and his record-breaking comic strip and multimedia phenomenon "Garfield." Davis (who had a place in his heart for two comic strip creators who were also from Central Indiana), knew Wright from his "Wildwood" strip, and knew Ponce from a prior "Garfield" licensing deal with one of Ponce's clients. Cantrell approached Davis with the idea of providing guidance and lead generation for licensing "Rustle" intellectual properties, and Davis agreed to let Cantrell "moonlight" for a few hours each month on behalf of the strip. Despite Cantrell's gracious guidance and tireless efforts, no real licensing opportunities ever emerged, and Cantrell's participation ceased after 6 months.
In May 2006 Steve Zeitler had to make what was undoubtedly one of the most difficult phone calls of his life, and informed Ponce that he and Melissa would not be able to continue fully funding "Rustle the Leaf." Wright's funding was partially continued, and Ponce worked with Wright through the end of 2006 to create new strips and to try to find additional revenue or sponsorship. By April 2007 with no real prospects on the horizon, the Zeitlers were unable to continue any funding, and Wright officially stopped working on "Rustle the Leaf" in May 2007. For a few weeks following, Ponce posted some previously unpublished strips on the site, but all new material stopped in July 2007.
What Remains.
Despite cessation of new production, the "Rustle the Leaf" web site still generates thousands of hits and visits each month. A comic viewer still functions, and visitors can read all strips published between November 2004 and July 2007. All lesson plans are still available for download, as is the digital version of "Rustle the Leaf's Earth Day Book." Despite the ups and downs, Ponce and Wright remain friends, and still believe that "Rustle" was a viable creative and business opportunity, but one that was a victim of bad timing. "We launched the new 'Rustle' site the day before the 2004 presidential election," said Ponce. "Following that controversial election—and the fact that there would not be an 'eco-friendly' shift in national policy or a new occupant of the White House—we had to struggle to find support. A year later, only days before we attended the first ever 'Sierra Summit' in San Francisco, Hurricane Katrina ripped the Gulf Coast apart, and environmental organizations of all types lost donations as Americans redirected their giving to rescue and recovery organizations. Everyone who was committed to environmental causes was financially strapped. In 2004-2005, our president still was not acknowledging the existence of Global Warming. There was no 'Inconvenient Truth' to start grass-roots dialogue. By the time that film came along, we were running on fumes economically. I think the whole thing was a matter of timing. It certainly wasn't a lack of investment on behalf of the Zeitlers, nor a lack of talent on behalf of Dan Wright. From every credible forum and authority, "Rustle the Leaf" was considered to be a funny, intelligent, beautifully drawn comic strip. One of California's leading environmental education groups called it 'the Green Calvin and Hobbes.' For us, that was the highest possible praise. For a few exciting, roller-coaster months, Dan and I had the opportunity to do something we loved, and we were fortunate enough to create several thousand fans along the way. Other than the big hole left in Steve and Melissa Zeitler's bank account, I wouldn't change a thing. And I believe their ongoing connection to "Rustle" [through Citra-Solv has provided both direct and indirect economic benefit for them—and will continue to do so into the future."

Hubert Newell

Hubert Michael Newell (February 16, 1904 – September 8, 1987) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Cheyenne from 1951 to 1978.
Biography.
Hubert Newell was born in Denver, Colorado, to Thomas and Ellen (née Taney) Newell; his parents were Irish immigrants from County Galway. A twin himself, he had a total of five siblings, including two sisters and three brothers. Newell studied under the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth before attending Sacred Heart High School and Regis College. After deciding to embark on an ecclesiastical career, he entered St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary and was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop John Tihen on June 15, 1930.
Newell served as assistant pastor at Our Lady of Sorrows Church in Walsenburg and at Immaculate Conception Cathedral in Denver. He was assistant principal of Cathedral High School from 1933 to 1937, whence he entered the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He there obtained a Master's degree in educational administration in 1938, and was named superintendent of parochial schools upon returning to Denver.
On August 2, 1947, Newell was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Titular Bishop of "Zapara" by Pope Pius XII. He received episcopal consecration on the following September 24 from Archbishop Urban Vehr, with Bishops Scannel and Philip Garrigan serving as co-consecrators; he was the first native Denverite to become a Catholic bishop. Among those present at Newell's reception was Senator Joseph O'Mahoney.
Newell succeeded Patrick McGovern as the fifth Bishop of Cheyenne upon the latter's death on November 8, 1951. He established the diocesan newspaper, The Wyoming Catholic Register, in 1952 and the Wyoming Council of Catholic Women in 1953. Newell was also a member of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, where he served on the committee for the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine.
He suffered a minor heart attack in April 1961, and attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965. On January 3, 1978, after twenty-six years of service, he resigned as Cheyenne's ordinary.
Newell later died at age 83.

A Group of Noble Dames

A Group of Noble dames is an 1891 collection of short stories written by Thomas Hardy. It is a frame narrative in which ten members of a club each tell one story about a noble dame in the 17th or 18th century. 
Contents.
Part I—Before Dinner
Part II—After Dinner
Publication.
All ten stories were published in serial magazines before Hardy collected them into book form. "The Duchess of Hamptonshire" and "The Honourable Laura" were written relatively early in Hardy's career, in 1878 and 1881 respectively. "The First Countess of Wessex" and "The Lady Penelope" were written in 1888-89. Hardy revised all four of these stories significantly before adding them to the collection in 1891. The remaining six stories were written in early 1890 and published in bowdlerised form in a special Christmas number of "The Graphic" in December 1890.
Hardy collected all ten stories together for the first time in "A Group of Noble Dames", which was published in England by Osgood, McIlvaine, & Co. and in America by Harper & Brothers in 1891. The critical reception of the book was mixed.
TV and Film Adaptations.
"Barbara of the House of Grebe" was adapted as a television drama by the BBC as part of an anthology series called Wessex Tales. Broadcast 12 December 1973 on BBC2.

Beat the Band

Beat the Band was a musical quiz show heard on NBC radio from 1940 to 1944 in two distinctly different series. The program popularized the show business catch phrase, "Give me a little traveling music," often uttered on TV a decade later by Jackie Gleason. 
In the first series, broadcast on Sundays at 6:30pm from Chicago, emcee Garry Moore read music-related questions submitted by listeners to band members in the 14-piece Ted Weems Orchestra. Originally sponsored by the General Mills cereal Kix, listeners whose questions were used on the air received $10; those who stumped the band received $20 and a case of Kix. Questions were often posed in the form of puns or riddles. such as, "Suppose a small fur-bearing animal gets so angry he explodes. What song title is suggested?" The answer from comedian-violinist Red Ingle, "Pop Goes the Weasel." Band members who answered questions incorrectly had to toss a fifty-cent piece on the bass drum. The musician with the most correctly answered questions at the end of the program took home the bass drum "kitty". Unlike most radio shows of the time, "Beat the Band" did not always originate in Chicago; the program was often broadcast on location from places like Denver, St. Louis, and Milwaukee. 
The program's vocalists were Perry Como, Parker Gibbs and Marvel Maxwell. Other cast members included Country Washburn and Elmo Tanner, the Whistling Troubador. This series aired from January 28, 1940 to February 23, 1941.
Relocating to New York as a summer replacement for Red Skelton's "Raleigh Cigarettes Program", the program began anew on June 15, 1943 with Raleigh Cigarettes as the sponsor (until June 1944). Music was supplied by the Harry Sosnik band. The first host of the second series was Hildegarde. After June 1944, the host was Eddie Mayehoff. The program came to an end on September 6, 1944.
Announcers were Marvin Miller and Tom Shirley. The program's theme music was "Out of the Night," composed by Harry Sosnik; and Walter Hirsch. The first version of this theme was by Weems and Hildegarde. The second version was performed by Sosnik.
Music was the basis for several quiz shows, such as "Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge". In 2001, Soundcraft issued a compact disk of transcripts for some of the 1940 episodes of the show.

The Angel Levine

The Angel Levine is a 1970 U.S. film directed by Jan Kadar and based on a short story by Bernard Malamud about an impoverished New York City tailor (played by Zero Mostel) unable to work due to health problems, creating a financial strain since his wife (Ida Kaminska) is seriously ill. The tailor's faith is challenged when a man calling himself Alexander Levine (Harry Belafonte) comes into his life, claiming to be his guardian angel. The angel is concerned that he must make the tailor believe in his mission, or else he will be unable to earn his angelic wings.
The Angel Levine was poorly received when it was first released, with Roger Greenspun of the "New York Times" stating that "given the reputations of the talents involved, film is a failure of major proportions. I have seen worse movies. But I cannot remember having seen a movie so nervously at odds with itself, so timid in its impulses, and so mistaken in its choices." When the film was released on DVD in 2002, Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk commented: ""The Angel Levine" is one of dozens of interesting movies in the United Artists library that seem to have been created for the purpose of being obscure.”

Francesco Coppola

Francesco Coppola (born: September 27, 1878, Naples, Italy; died 1957, Anacapri, Italy) was prominent Italian journalist and politician in the twentieth century who associated with Italian nationalism and later Italian Fascism. 
From 1904 to 1908 Coppola wrote for "Il Giornale d'Italia", a Rome newspaper in which he was known for expressing anti-democratic and anti-socialist sentiments. In 1908, Coppola moved to writing for the Rome newspaper "La Tribuna" where he began to strongly support Italian nationalism and imperialism. Two years later Coppola became one of the founders of the nationalist political party called the Italian Nationalist Association and with the support of two other prominent nationalists, Enrico Corradini and Luigi Federzoni, he launched the party's official newspaper, "L'Idea Nazionale". Coppola strongly supported Italy's actions in the Italo-Libyan War which resulted in the capture of Libya from the Ottoman Empire.
During World War I, Coppola demanded that Italy join the war. In 1916, Coppola fought on the front in the Italian army. From 1917 to 1918 he undertook various nationalist propaganda missions. Coppola attended the Paris Peace Conference and was enraged with the territorial settlement that Italy received, accusing the Italian government and the Allies of giving Italy a "mutilated victory".
In the aftermath of World War I, Coppola joined Benito Mussolini's Fascist movement in 1919. Coppola by this time was known for advocating racist philosophy within the Fascist movement. In 1923, Coppola participated in influencing the Italian Nationalist Association to join the National Fascist Party. In 1923 and 1925, Coppola served the Fascist government as an Italian delegate to the League of Nations. In 1929 when he was made a professor at the University of Perugia, Mussolini made him a member of the Royal Academy of Italy in 1929.

Sant Pau del Camp

Sant Pau del Camp () (Catalan for "Saint Paul of the countryside" or "in the fields") is a church and former monastery in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. While the monastery now stands within the El Raval district in central Barcelona, it once stood outside the city (before 14th century); its rural location gave the church its name.
History.
There are no sources about the monastery's origins, although it is generally thought that it was founded in the late 9th century, probably by count Wilfred II of Barcelona. The monastery is documented from 977; in 985 it was attacked and nearly destroyed by the Muslim troops of al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir, and abandoned by the monks.
Restorations were begun in 1096 and a new monastic community arrived. The new monastery was again attacked in 1114; three years later it became a priory of the monastery of Sant Cugat, and again restored. It was defended by the city's new line of walls in the 14th century. The monks were driven from the monastery in 1835.
It was declared National Monument in 1879.
Architecture.
The Romanesque monastery has a small cloister, built in the 13th century. It features lobular arcades supported by double columns, whose capitals are decorated by biblical and daily life scenes, animals, monsters and vegetable motifs. The abbots' house was built in the 13th-14th and early 18th century.
The church is on the Greek cross plan, with a single aisle. It has a transept with three apses, and the interior is covered by barrel vaults. The entrance doorway has two columns with ancient marble Visigothic capitals, while in the tympanum is depicted Christ in Majesty with Saints Paul and Peter. 
The chapter house (14th century) houses the tomb of the supposed founder of the monastery, Wilfred II.

Taylor state

In plasma physics, a Taylor state is the minimum energy state of a plasma satisfying the constraint of conserving magnetic helicity.
Derivation.
Consider a closed, simply-connected, flux-conserving, perfectly conducting surface formula_1 surrounding a plasma with negligible thermal energy (formula_2).
Since formula_3 on formula_1. This implies that formula_5. 
As discussed above, the plasma would relax towards a minimum energy state while conserving its magnetic helicity. Since the boundary is perfectly conducting, there cannot be any change in the associated flux. This implies formula_6 and formula_7 on formula_1.
We formulate a variational problem of minimizing the plasma energy formula_9 while conserving magnetic helicity formula_10.
The variational problem is
formula_11.
After some algebra this leads to the following constraint for the minimum energy state
formula_12.

Loble

Loble, also known as Lig-lemu or '"Lillemu",(d. ca. 1565) was the Mapuche vice-toqui of the Moluche north of the Bio-Bio River who led the second Mapuche revolt during the Arauco War.
After a brief fight Loble defeated the troops of captain Francisco de Vaca in the Itata River valley who were coming with reinforcements from Santiago. After Millalelmo ambushed Spanish reinforcements coming from Angol under Juan Perez de Zurita, at a crossing of the Andalién River the Mapuche had cut off the city and garrison of Concepcion from outside aid by land.
Millalelmu and Loble besieged Concepcion with 20,000 warriors in February 1564. The siege lasted until at the end of March two ships arrived bringing food that would permit the siege to continue for a much longer time. On the other side the Mapuche had used up local sources of food and were finding it difficult to maintain their large force. With the harvest season coming and with the news of their defeat in the Battle of Angol they were nervous that their families might starve or their undefended homes might be attacked from Angol or Santiago. They raised their siege on April 1, and dispersed to their homes for the winter.
The governor Pedro de Villagra left Santiago in mid January 1565 with 150 Spaniards and 800 Indian auxiliaries and marched south to the Maule River. During the seven months Villagra was in Santiago, Loble had built a strong pucara on the Perquilauquén River, blocking the road south to Concepcion and in the Second Battle of Reinohuelén Villagra rapidly took it and destroyed the Mapuche army holding it. Soon afterward as Loble was bringing up reinforcements but unaware of the defeat of his army he was ambushed, defeated and captured. In the next few months Villagra brought an end to the Mapuche revolt north of the Bio-Bio.

Angst (American band)

Angst was an American band from San Francisco, California. In mid-1978, brothers Joseph Pope and Jon E. Risk formed their first punk rock group, the Instants, in Boulder, Colorado. The band gigged in the Denver/Boulder area before moving to England in late 1979 where they lasted only a few months. In 1980 Joseph and Jon then settled in San Francisco and formed Angst along with drummer Michael Hursey (later replaced by Andy Kaps). 
Angst played their first show in mid-1981, and by the end of 1982 had contributed songs to Sub Pop (when it was still a cassette magazine) and the Alternative Tentacles/Maximum RocknRoll compilation, "Not So Quiet on the Western Front". From the outset the band gigged regularly in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and sometime in 1982 they played a show with the Middle Class and 100 Flowers in San Francisco. John Talley-Jones (Urinals/100 Flowers) was impressed enough with the group that he offered to release a record for them on his label, Happy Squid Records. Angst traveled to Los Angeles shortly thereafter and recorded seven songs at Radio Tokyo studios (engineered by Ethan James) that would become their debut, eponymous 12”, released in 1983.
Though Angst played many venues with a wide variety of bands, the majority of their shows locally were within the punk/hardcore scene. Their eclectic mix of punk, country, pop, 1960s garage, etc. was not particularly well received by the strict hardcore audiences of early 1980s San Francisco. Angst actively sought out and played with many of Los Angeles based SST Records’ bands (Minutemen, Saccharine Trust, Meat Puppets, Black Flag, et al.), and in 1984 was signed to the label by Joe Carducci, who subsequently produced the first two (of four) LPs that Angst recorded for the label (the latter LPs were produced by Vitus Matare of the Last).
After releasing their debut LP "Lite Life" in 1985, Angst began to play outside of California, and embarked on their first national tour. Over the next four years they toured America and Europe several times, as well as continuing to play regularly in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, though they were never able to gain any kind of following in their own home town. By early 1989 the band had run its course, and broke up after their final European tour.
In later years, Angst would be cited by Black Francis/Frank Black of Pixies fame as a major influence upon his work. He covered “Some Things (I Can’t Get Used To)” on his "Snake Oil" LP, and wrote a tribute song to the band entitled simply “Angst” that appears on the UK-only CD release of “Robert Onion” as well as on the "One More Road For The Hit" collection of B-sides and rarities. When asked by Rolling Stone magazine what band he would like to see reunite, he stated: “Angst. I'm sure there are other bands called Angst, but this is an obscure one from SST in the mid-Eighties. They used to play at the Rathskeller in Boston -- that's where I first heard them. Then I bought all their records. They were a San Francisco trio -- high energy but not punk -- and they were very influential on the Pixies and on me. "Lite Life" is their best album -- good luck finding it”.

Jason Weaver (jockey)

Jason Weaver (9 February 1972-) is a former British flat racing jockey who had much of his major success in the mid-1990s. In total, Weaver rode more than 1,000 winners in a career which spanned fourteen years.
Biography.
Weaver began his career in 1989 with Luca Cumani and became champion apprentice in 1993 with 60 winners.
Later he moved to Middleham to become a stable jockey to Mark Johnston. He is one of only seven Flat jockeys to have ridden 200 winners in one season, which he accomplished in 1994, a fine year of his career in which he also won the 2,000 Guineas on Mister Baileys. However, this was achieved over a full calendar year including all-weather racing in winter, a tabulation not used for the jockeys' title in most other years. He won the 1995 Ascot Gold Cup with the horse Double Trigger and the 1995 Prix de l'Abbaye de Longchamp on Hever Gold Rose. A year later at Royal Ascot, Weaver won the St. James's Palace Stakes with Bijou d'Inde. 
In 2002 Weaver announced his retirement as a jockey at the age of 30, citing problems with keeping his weight down the major issue. However he was keen to stay in the sport, seeing his retirement as a jockey as a way forward in other management and training areas of the sport. He works as a presenter for the television horse racing channel At the Races.
However, in 2006, he announced his comeback, despite a significant weight gain. It would be only for a single race, though.
The match was the Ladbrokes Shergar Cup Duel, an annual prelude to the Shergar Cup at Ascot between two of the world's premier jockeys. The 2006 contest was between Jason Weaver, who represented the Great Britain and Ireland team, and Michael Roberts, who served as the Rest of the World team manager. Riding Pic Up Sticks, the win was secured by Jason Weaver, who said afterwards, "Ascot was a lucky track for me when I was riding so it is great to have ridden a winner on the new course."

Conditional sentence (Canada)

A conditional sentence is a non-custodial punishment for crime. It is one type of criminal sentencing used in Canada.
Description.
Conditional refers to rules the offender must follow in order to remain out of prison, which are similar to when one is on parole. 
These are most often treatment for drug or alcohol abuse, curfews, and community service. Offenders who breach their conditions or re-offend must complete their sentence in prison.
To receive a conditional sentence, the sentencing judge must be satisfied that the offender does not pose a danger to the community. This allows less serious offenders to remain in their communities or at home. The largest percentage of conditional sentences are for property crime. By law, a conditional sentence must be less than two years in duration; they have an average length of eight months., and the offence that the offender was convicted of cannot be punishable by a minimum sentence of imprisonment. 
Conditional sentences were introduced in 1995 as a response to perceived over-incarceration, especially among aboriginal Canadians.
Administration.
Conditional sentences are administered by provincial probation and parole services. The accused must be supervised by a probation officer and regularly attend meetings.
Breach of a Conditional Sentence.
An accused person may be arrested without warrant where a peace officer believes on reasonable grounds that the accused has failed to comply with a condition or by warrant. An accused arrested for an alleged breach will be detained in custody pending a hearing to determine whether a breach occurred. The accused may apply for bail pending the hearing. However, under subsection 515(6) the accused bears the onus. Upon the earliest of the accused being arrested for an alleged breach or upon the issuance of a warrant, the conditional sentence stops running. At a breach hearing the Crown bears the onus to prove a breach on a balance of probabilities. If the court finds that a breach occurred, the accused bears to onus to justify the continuation of the conditional sentence. The court may do one of three things: take no action, order that the accused serve a portion of the conditional sentence in custody, or terminate the conditional sentence and order that the accused serve the remainder of the conditional sentence in custody.
Remission.
A conditional sentence is a carceral sentence. However, the accused is ineligible for remission. Typically accused persons sentenced to custody are given a one day reduction for every two days served, provided the accused is of good behaviour and follows the institutional rules (see sec. 6 of the Prisons and Reformatories Act). This results in the vast majority of accused persons serving two thirds of their sentence. Therefore, where the conditions of the conditional sentence resemble incarceration (e.g. a conditional requiring the accused person to reside in a secure psychiatric hospital), the conditional sentence may actually be more harsh than a carceral sentence (i.e. a two year conditional sentence which is effectively served in an institution is equivalent to a three year prison sentence since a person sentenced to three years would be eligible for mandatory release after two thirds of the sentence).
Controversy.
Conditional sentences are controversial among some Canadians as being too lenient. For example, Mothers Against Drunk Driving have argued that they should not be available to persons convicted of impaired driving. 
Former justice minister Vic Toews, then justice critic for the Conservative Party of Canada, has also criticized them, saying that Canada needs to "get the drug men and the gunmen off the streets and get rid of conditional sentences." In 2008, Stephen Harper noted that in Saskatchewan 39 per cent of criminals sentenced to house arrest were sent back to jail for breaching their conditions. In addition, thousands convicted of crimes of violence, including homicides and sexual assaults have been given conditional sentences. 
Proponents of conditional sentences, however, have noted that the courts must not give a conditional sentence if it believes the offender will endanger the community. Furthermore, only a minority of offenders breach their conditions or reoffend, and that conditional sentencing saves taxpayers over $50,000 per inmate each year.

Philip Saffman

Philip Geoffrey Saffman FRS (March 19, 1931 – August 17, 2008) was an applied mathematician, the Theodore von Kármán Professor of Applied Mathematics and Aeronautics at the California Institute of Technology.
Life, career and honors.
Saffman was born in Leeds, England, and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he received his Ph.D. in 1956.
He joined the Caltech faculty in 1964 and was named the Theodore von Kármán Professor in 1995. He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the Royal Society, and the recipient of the American Physical Society's Otto Laporte Award.
Saffman was survived by his wife (Ruth), three children (Mark, Louise, Emma), and eight grandchildren (Timothy, Gregory, Rae, Jenny, Nadine, Aaron, Miriam, Alexandra and Andre).
Scientific work.
According to Prof. Dan Meiron, Saffman “really was one of the leading figures in fluid mechanics,” and he influenced almost every subfield of that discipline. He is known (with his co-author Geoffrey Ingram Taylor) for the Saffman–Taylor instability in viscous fingering of fluid boundaries, a phenomenon important for its applications in enhanced oil recovery, and for the Saffman–Delbrück model of protein diffusion in membranes which he published with his Caltech colleague and Pasadena neighbor Max Delbrück. He made important contributions to the theory of vorticity arising from the motion of ships and aircraft through water and air; his work on wake turbulence led the airlines to increase the minimum time between takeoffs of airplanes on the same runway. Saffman also studied the flow of spheroidal particles in a fluid, such as bubbles in a carbonated beverage or corpuscles in blood; his work overturned previous assumptions that inertia was an important factor in these particles' motion and showed instead that Non-Newtonian properties of fluids play a significant role.
Along with his many research papers, Saffman wrote a book, "Vortex Dynamics", surveying a field to which he had been a principal contributor. Russel Caflisch writes that “This book should be read by everyone interested in vortex dynamics or fluid dynamics in general.”

Hôpital Temporaire d'Arc-en-Barrois

Hôpital Temporaire d'Arc-en-Barrois was an emergency evacuation hospital serving the French 3rd Army Corps during World War I. It was organised and staffed by British volunteers and served French other ranks.
History.
Hôpital Temporaire d’Arc-en-Barrois was a voluntary civilian British hospital unit established in the Château d'Arc-en-Barrois, Haute-Marne, France, for the aid of wounded French soldiers in the Great War. Founded in January 1915 under approval of the Anglo-French Hospital Committee of the British Red Cross Society, London, the hospital of 110 beds was conducted under military command of the French army's Service de Santé. The hospital's first military casualties arrived on 27 January 1915 from the Argonne Forest battlefront. In February 1915 the regional Service de Santé requested an expansion of hospital services and a convalescent hospital was established in the vacant village hospice building, bringing the total number of beds to 180. 
Located sixty miles or more to the rear of the war's entrenched front lines, Hôpital Temporaire received casualties from battles in the Argonne Forest and Champagne Offensive (1915), Verdun (1916) and the Meuse-Argonne Campaign (1918). Throughout the war wounded soldiers arrived in Haute-Marne via hospital train through Latrecey-Ormoy-sur-Aube, a remote station located 11 miles from Arc-en-Barrois, and were transported to the château aboard Hôpital Temporaire's small motor ambulance fleet. Wounded and sick soldiers were attended in hospital by a staff of female trained nurses, a small contingent of surgeons and medical students and female auxiliary hospital staff provided by the British Red Cross Voluntary Aid Detachment (V.A.D.). Male volunteers authorized by the British Red Cross typically served as hospital orderlies and ambulance drivers. The hospital maintained numerous essential services--operating theatre, anesthesia, radiography, dentistry, apothecary and clinical laboratory--was financially supported by a large international donor base and supplied regularly by voluntary British war supply depots. 
In continuous service until its official demobilization in February 1919, the hospital received a total of 3071 patients; 76 deaths were recorded. More than 400 voluntary and contracted staff served at Hôpital Temporaire, representing the United Kingdom, Canada and Newfoundland, Australia, USA and Denmark. 
The Hospital's Founding: 1914.
In the autumn of 1914 four English sisters, Madeline and Susan Bromley-Martin, Eleanor Martin-Holland and Anora Russell, natives of Worcestershire, heard alarming news from France of the French military's catastrophic shortage of military hospital beds and trained nurses. As were many British civilians eager to supply their French ally with medical supplies and hospital staff, the Bromley-Martin sisters joined the early rush to offer humanitarian aid and skilled personnel. Madeline devised a hospital plan as family and friends gathered financial supporters, collected supplies, recruited hospital volunteers and secured a staff of trained nurses and surgeons. 
British Red Cross and War Office officials made wary of inexpert civilian interference in international military medical affairs, had enacted in late 1914 policies deterring the transfer of voluntary hospitals to France. The Bromley-Martin proposal, however, gained the personal support of Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald and the Hon. Arthur Stanley, M.P., overseers of the powerful British Red Cross Joint War Committee and its temporary Anglo-French Hospital Sub-Committee. The hospital project gained approval in November. Next, French military authorization had to be obtained for a hospital building and for permits granting the British hospital personnel's entry into France. Lacking more suitable alternatives in proximity to the French coastline, the Bromley-Martin hospital slated its installation for an empty château in rural Eastern France. In December the building, the hospital proposal and the British staff were approved for service by French Minister of War Alexandre Millerand and Service de Santé chief, Dr Ange François Troussaint.
Personnel.
Hôpital Temporaire's voluntary hospital personnel included a significant number of writers, poets, artists and illustrators. Kathleen Scott, the Rodin-trained sculptress and widow of the Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott, organized and led the hospital's small auto ambulance service in early 1915. Henry Tonks, painter, Slade Art School Professor and trained physician was among the hospital's founding staff. Tonks served between January–April 1915 as hospital anaesthetist and ward physician. John Masefield, Britain's future Poet Laureate, served a six week term as a volunteer orderly during the spring of 1915. The English poet Laurence Binyon, volunteered as a hospital orderly during 1915 and 1916. His ward experiences among wounded French soldiers inspired his poems, "Fetching the Wounded", "The Distant Guns", "Men of Verdun", and "La Patrie". The English Impressionist painter, Wilfrid de Glehn and his American-born wife, artist Jane Emmet de Glehn, were among Hôpital Temporaire's first volunteers; Wilfrid served as hospital orderly, military interpreter and ambulance driver; Jane supervised laundry and tea service and sketched soldiers' portraits for the benefit of a limb prosthetics fund. British architect Edmund Fisher, son of historian Herbert William Fisher worked as an orderly in 1915, helping with X-ray work. Other notable artists were children's book illustrator Frank Adams; painter William Radford Dakin, a former obstetrician and physician; lithographer Arthur Cadogan Blunt.

Zagreb bypass

Zagreb bypass () is a U-shaped motorway partially encircling Zagreb, Croatia. The largest part by far, between Jankomir and Ivanja Reka interchanges, was built between 1977 and 1979, while the Ivanja Reka – Sveta Helena section was built between 1996 and 1999. The bypass is long, tracing around the city from the northwestern suburb of Zaprešić to Sveta Helena in the northeast. The bypass crosses the Sava River twice and comprises a bridge across the Sava-Odra floodwater overflow canal. As the busiest sections between Jankomir and Buzin interchanges carry traffic volume of approximately 45,000 AADT, it is the most heavily used motorway sector in Croatia.
Zagreb bypass is not designated as a separate motorway with a distinct motorway number, rather it consists of sections of three motorways:
Those motorway sections are concurrent with sections of the D1 and D3 state roads as well as European routes E59, E65, E70 and E71.
The bypass currently comprises four traffic lanes along its entire length, with an emergency lane in each direction. In its current form, the Zagreb bypass has a small number of interchanges spaced widely apart. For example, the current Zaprešić interchange extends a trip from Zaprešić to Zagreb via the bypass by . The last new interchange was built in 2007–2008 at Kosnica in the southeast, to connect the Homeland Bridge and Zagreb via Radnička cesta (Ž1029).
There are two rest areas along the bypass: Lučko rest area is located between Jankomir and Lučko interchanges comprising famous Plitvice Motel, well known for its pedestrian bridge across the bypass, while Sesvete rest area is located between Popovec and Sveta Helena interchanges. A new rest area is planned between Jakuševec and Kosnica interchanges.
Future expansion.
A proposal has been made in 2007 for a new interchange near Zaprešić, one that would reduce traveling time between the cities.
As a part of the A11 motorway Jakuševec interchange - Velika Gorica section construction works, a new interchange is under construction east of current Buzin interchange, which is in turn planned to be abolished, in favor of another new interchange, Sveta Klara, further to the west.
A long-term plan exists to build a new outer bypass road around Zagreb. The outer bypass would be a part of the tolled motorway network thus permitting vehicles not to stop at two toll plazas near Zagreb as they enter and leave the present bypass, decreasing congestion on the inner bypass motorway. 2009-2012 motorway and road construction plan entails funds for development of design documents for the outer bypass motorway and specifies its route: It is to be a long motorway originating from the A2 motorway Luka interchange, connecting the A3 motorway Gradina interchange near Samobor, the A1 motorway Horvati interchange, the A11 motorway Mraclin interchange, once again the A3 motorway Ivanić Grad interchange and finally the A4 motorway Zelina interchange. A total of 14 interchanges are planned on the new bypass, including the ones connecting it to the other motorways already specified, connecting the outer bypass to all major roads intersected.
Because of the Medvednica Mountain north of Zagreb, the present bypass is U-shaped, leaving the city without a northern bypass that would connect the A2 and A4 highways. A northern branch (around 27 km long) of the bypass was planned and designed to bridge the gap. It was planned to connect the Zaprešić interchange with the Popovec interchange. The route would have required a number of long tunnels and viaducts making it expensive. According to the general design alternative in a study executed by the Faculty of Architecture and Institut IGH, the route would comprise 15 tunnels. The tunnels longer than 500 m would be: Ivanec Tunnel (2656 m), Borčec Tunnel (1797 m), Pantovčak Tunnel (1625 m), Dotrščina Tunnel (1050 m), Remete 1 Tunnel (1025 m), Čuguvec Tunnel (550 m) and Novaki Tunnel (502 m). The construction works were planned in stages with an additional 5–10 km long tunnel built subsequently through Medvednica Mountain to connect Zagreb and Hrvatsko zagorje directly. However, as of September 2011, all such plans were cancelled as unfeasible.

Aminohippuric acid

Aminohippuric acid or para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), a derivative of hippuric acid, is a diagnostic agent useful in medical tests involving the kidney used in the measurement of renal plasma flow. It is an amide derivative of the amino acid glycine and para-aminobenzoic acid that is not naturally found in man; it needs to be IV infused before use diagnostically.
Uses.
Diagnostics.
PAH is useful for the measurement of renal plasma flow because it is secreted primarily by the renal tubules; only 20-30% is filtered by the glomerulus. PAH is freely filtered from plasma in the glomerulus and not reabsorbed by the tubules, similar to inulin. PAH differs from inulin in that the fraction of PAH that bypasses the glomerulus and enters the nephron's tubular cells (via the peritubular capillaries) is completely secreted. Thus, through the above two mechanisms, PAH is completely filtered from the plasma reaching the nephron. For this reason, renal clearance of PAH is useful in calculation of renal plasma flow (RPF), which empirically is (1 − hematocrit) × renal blood flow. The clearance of PAH, however, is reflective only of RPF to portions of the kidney that deal with urine formation, and thus underestimates actual RPF by about 10%.
The renal extraction ratio of PAH in a normal individual is approximately 0.92.
Pharmaceuticals.
Aminohippuric acid is often used as the sodium salt sodium para-aminohippurate. During World War II, para-aminohippurate was given along with penicillin in order to prolong the time penicillin circulated in the blood. Because both penicillin and para-aminohippurate compete for the same transporter in the kidney, administering para-aminohippurate with penicillin decreased the clearance of penicillin from the body by the kidney, providing better antibacterial therapy. Transporters found in the kidney eliminate organic anions and cations from the blood by moving substances, in this case, drug metabolites, from blood into urine.
Other.
In vultures, the NSAID diclofenac, which is extraordinarily toxic to vultures, interferes with the renal transport of uric acid via the PAH channel.

Meigan cai (mei-kan tsai; ; or mei cai (mei tsai; ) is a type of dry pickled Chinese mustard of the Hakka people from Huizhou, Guangdong province, China. Meigan cai is also used in the cuisine of Shaoxing (绍兴), Zhejiang province, China.
The pickle consists of a whole head of various varieties of Chinese mustards and cabbages (芥菜、油菜、白菜) that has undergone an elaborate process consisting of drying, steaming, and salting. The vegetables are harvested, trimmed before the Qingming Festival, and sun-dried until limp. It is then salted or brined, kneaded until the juices are exuded, and left to ferment in large clay urns for 15 to 20 days. The vegetable is then repeatedly steamed and dried until reddish brown in colour and highly fragrant.
This pickled vegetable is used to flavor stewed dishes, in particular "Meigan cai cooked with meat" (梅菜扣肉/梅干菜烧肉)) or for "Meigancai baozi" (梅菜菜包). "Meigan cai" was formerly a tribute item to the imperial palace in the Qing Dynasty.

Ceruletide

Ceruletide (INN), also known as cerulein or caerulein, is a ten amino acid oligopeptide that stimulates smooth muscle and increases digestive secretions. Ceruletide is similar in action and composition to cholecystokinin. It stimulates gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretion; and certain smooth muscle. It is used in paralytic ileus and as diagnostic aid in pancreatic malfunction. It is used to induce pancreatitis in experimental animal models.
Ceruletide was discovered and its structure elucidated in 1967 by Australian and Italian scientists from dried skins of the Australian green tree frog ("Litoria caerulea", formerly "Hyla caerulea"). Its amino acid sequence is Pglu-Gln-Asp-Tyr[SO3H]-Thr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2.
Induction of pancreatitis.
Ceruletide upregulates pancreatic acinar cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) proteins through intracellular upregulation of NF-κB. Surface ICAM-1 in turn promotes neutrophil adhesion onto acinar cells enhancing pancreatic inflammation. In addition to promoting the inflammatory cell reaction to acinar cells, ceruletide induces pancreatitis through dysregulation of digestive enzyme production and cytoplasmic vacuolization, leading to acinar cell death and pancreatic edema. Ceruletide also activates NADPH oxidase, a source of reactive oxygen species contributing to inflammation, as well as the Janus kinase/signal transducer, another inflammation inducer.

Bridgewater House, Runcorn

Bridgewater House, Runcorn is located in the Old Coach Road, Runcorn, Cheshire, England. It is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. Originally built for the use of the Duke of Bridgewater, it has since has been used for various purposes and has now been converted into offices.
History.
Bridgewater House was built in 1771, near the lower end of a line of ten locks leading from the Runcorn basin of the Bridgewater Canal to the River Mersey. It was the occasional residence of the Duke of Bridgewater when he was supervising the building and operation of the Runcorn branch of the canal. The canal was opened to the Mersey in 1773 and completed throughout its length in 1776. After the Duke's death in 1803 the house was used as offices by the Bridgewater Trustees, and from 1872 by the Bridgewater Navigation Company. In 1887 the assets of this company, including the house, were bought by the Manchester Ship Canal Company, who used it mainly for the purpose of entertaining. At the outbreak of the Second World War, part of the house was taken over by the Balloon Section of the Royal Air Force. In 1943 the whole house was requisitioned by the Air Ministry. After the war the house returned to the ownership of the Manchester Ship Canal Company and its future became uncertain. In 1998 a fire damaged the roof and many of the rooms.
Architecture.
The house is built in brown brick with a slate roof and stone dressings in Georgian style. Its consists of 2½ storeys with a basement. The entrance front has five bays and the canal front seven bays. Steps lead up to the entrance which has a stone Doric doorcase and the entrance front is rusticated up to the ground floor level. There are stone bands at the first and second sill levels and at the top is a stone cornice with a brick parapet. The roof is hipped. The authors of the "Buildings of England" series describe the house as being "imposing".
Present use.
The house has been repaired and restored and is now owned by Bridgewater Property Management. This company uses it partly for its own purposes and leases the rest of the building as offices for other companies.

Belyllioth

Belyllioth is a fictional demon published by DC Comics. She debuted in "Artemis: Requiem" #1 (June, 1996), and was created by William Messner-Loebs and Ed Benes.
Fictional character biography.
Belyllioth started as a demon General living in the portion of Hell ruled over by the demon Dalkriig-Hath. When Wonder Woman entered this realm looking for her fallen sister Artemis, Belyllioth attempted to capture the intruder. Failing to do so, Dalkriig-Hath saw this as a failure and planned on publicly humiliating her by torture as an example to the other demons who may fail in their tasks. During this time though Dalkriig-Hath's newest bride Artemis and Wonder Woman were watching the public spectacle from a nearby building.
Diana managed to stop the executioner from torturing Belyllioth but was soon made a victim herself by the large number of demons faithful to Dalkriig-Hath. Artemis then joined the fight by freeing Belyllioth from her shackles, allowing her and her loyal Myrmidon demons to take part in the battle also. Grateful to Artemis and Diana for freeing her, Belyllioth held back Dalkriig-Hath's forces until they could safely escape. Following their example, Belyllioth and her minions retreated to safety also.
Opting to bide her time and accumulate more demons to help her gain revenge against Dalkriig-Hath, Belyllioth was surprised to discover that a few months after their escape that Artemis had managed to kill Dalkriig-Hath in the mortal world. She thanked Artemis and quickly tried to assume lordship of the realm. Artemis' only stipulation for not standing in Belyllioth's way from doing so was that Belyllioth release the souls of 5 members of the demon hunting group The Hellenders who had died battling Dalkriig-Hath and the life of a woman who had committed suicide and her daughter. She agreed and they were given life again.
Belyllioth soon discovered though that holding on to her newfound title would be hard to do. The remaining 12 Princes of Hell had also discovered that Dalkriig-Hath had been destroyed and each tried to take over his portion of hell for themselves. This caused a huge war to take place that seemed to be a losing battle.
Realizing that as Dalkriig-Hath's widow Artemis was by rights entitled to become his replacement as ruler, Belyllioth traveled to the mortal realm seeking Artemis' aid. Artemis agreed to help Belyllioth's forces as the Underworld battle caused serious after effects in the mortal world. Telling Belyllioth that she did not want to rule her dead husband's realm, Artemis hatched a plan.
Disguised as Artemis, Belyllioth presented herself before the 12 Princes of Hell demanding that she be allowed rule. They grudgingly accepted and magically gave her all rights to the title of the 13th Prince of Hell. After the ceremony was ended Belyllioth revealed her true form, which angered the 12 other rulers. As they could not refute their established blessing, they were forced to accept Belyllioth as a fellow ruler.
They did promise Artemis though that for her treachery that they would seek revenge against her if she should ever enter Hell again. Fortunately for her, Belyllioth now considers Artemis to be a great ally for helping her get the 13th throne and will help protect her when needed.
Powers and abilities.
Belyllioth is now a high ranking demon lord, commanding 1/13th of the demons of hell. She is also a skilled sorcerer and warrior.

Gravigrada

Gravigrada is the name of a suborder of Mammals established by the French naturalist Henri-Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1839, within the order Quaternates. He included three genera in the suborder: Elephas, Dinotherium and Manatus (Trichechus).
The name is no longer considered valid, as the animals that were included within Gravigrada are now believed to belong to two different orders, Sirenia and Proboscidea.

Black Sun Ensemble is a 1985 psychedelic rock recording by the Black Sun Ensemble. Originally issued privately, it was later reissued, most recently on Camera Obscura Records. Byron Coley writes in the liner notes to the Camera Obscure reissue that "It is difficult to think of a band that has ever produced psychedelic music that sounded even remotely like the original Black Sun's." It was symptomatic of the renewed interest in 1960s psychedelia evidenced by the Paisley Underground, 1980s garage rock revival bands, and Prince.

Moses Mahlangu

Moses Mahlangu (born 1925) was a long-time supporter of the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in South Africa. Mahlangu first found a discarded copy of the Book of Mormon in 1964. At the time. he was a Christian preacher in South African townships. 
The first copy of the Book of Mormon he found had a torn title page, so it was a few years before he learned who had published it. When he did contact the mission president in South Africa, he was given church literature. However, since apartheid laws prohibited blacks and whites from meeting together for religious purposes and because of the LDS Church's restriction on ordaining black men to the priesthood, Mahlangu was told he would have to wait to be baptized.
In 1978, LDS Church President Spencer W. Kimball received a revelation extending the priesthood to all worthy male church members. In 1980, Mahlangu and his family was baptized and he was ordained to the priesthood. Also baptized at the same time were several black people he had introduced to the church since he first found the Book of Mormon.

Skatterman

Stacy Landis, better known by his stage name Skatterman (pronounced Scātterman), is an American rapper from Kansas City, Missouri.
Biography.
Starting as a teen, the syllable spitter knocked out hits with different groups, starting with Southside Rollers in 1999. In high school, Skatterman met rapper Snug Brim, and the two became longtime collaborators. When their 2001 album “Worth a Million” caught the attention of Tech N9ne and his label Strange Music, the duo signed on with Strange for a successful, seven-year run.
After 8 years as Strange Music's self-proclaimed black sheep, 2012 marks the first official studio album for Indie Icon Tech N9ne’s former number one henchman. Skatterman has elevated his game even further since his separation from right hand man Snug Brim to develop a new sound and forge a new direction from a now solitary and more personal point of view.
Fall 2012 Skatterman, will release his epic first solo album "Rise 2 Power"! The new album will feature an assortment of platinum class production and guest appearances from such notables as: Paul Wall, Too $hort, Jim Jones, Bun B, Slim Thug, Ludacris, Tech N9ne and Lil Flip (aka Mr Flip Gates). 
Skatterman calls the project "TRUE." 
"It's about my reality," Skatterman says. "It's for the people who are still in the streets, or have people they love still in the streets." Expect the rapper to pull no punches. Given the freedom to speak entirely for himself, Skatterman plans to immortalize on wax his life experiences from the urban core, and his frustrations with the justice system, false friends and broken homes. The lead single called "Get It In" expresses Skatterman's attempt to distance himself from the drug game but the reminder of his allegiance to the life.
Though the sounds are evolving, Skatterman is still the same person he's always been. Skatterman says. "I have a lot of trust issues -- I don't trust anybody. I'm antisocial, so when I have a show, I arrive solo. I have been an artist on a label and I have been a part of a group. This is finally my opportunity to do ME." 
Trust this: Skatterman's "Street Life" will drop like a sonic blast.
Skatterman and Snug Brim.
Skatterman & Snug Brim is a rap duo from Kansas City, Missouri, best known for their song, Block Party.
After releasing projects separately, Skatterman (born Stacy Dewayne Landisand Snug Brim (born Aaron R. Henderson[1) combined as a group. The duo released their first album, Worth A Million, in 2002 through Below Radar Records. On the cover they were listed as "Skatterman & Snug Brim," but the inside of the case displayed "Skatterman & Snug Brim AKA Yung Gunz." The "Yung Gunz" name was later dropped due to a conflict with another group of the same name, but different spelling. (Young Gunz)
Strange Music.
Travis, an established businessman in the world of furniture, was looking to get into the music industry. He had been a fan of Tech N9ne's and had seen how his career was being handled.
Tech at the time had several commitments and deals pulling him in several directions. He was currently signed to Qwest Records as well as MidwestSide Records, he also had commitments with both QDIII's Soundlab and Sway & King Tech of The Wake Up Show. Travis came into the picture and offered Tech something he never had, his own label. They agreed upon a 50/50 set up, Travis acting as President and Tech as Vice President.
Their first venture was a deal with JCOR Entertainment to release Anghellic, though JCOR mishandled the album. They would then seek another 50/50 deal, this time with Mark Cerami (previously of Priority Records) & Dave Weiner (previously of JCOR Entertainment) who were doing their own joint label at the time, MSC Entertainment. The first album Absolute Power was a success, selling about 250,000 copies.
The label is now independent, no longer joined with MSC Entertainment, instead having a distribution deal through Fontana Distribution. Their first release under the deal with Fontana was Tech N9ne's 2006 effort, Everready (The Religion). While many albums were advertised for 2007 releases in the artwork for that album, only one release was seen in 2007 from Strange Music, Misery Loves Kompany.
In 2002, Skatterman and Snug Brim was the first group to officially sign with Strange Music. They recorded the album, "Urban Legendz" which was released in 2004. The single from the album, "Block Party," charted #24 on "Billboard"'s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales in October of the same year.
"Word on tha Streets" was released August 12, 2008. The follow up to their Urban Legendz album featured the songs: "I'm That Nigga", "Sukka Dukkas" and "Heartbreaker." Featured artists included Tech N9ne, Young Buck, Paul Wall and Rich The Factor.
On February 9, 2009, it was announced on Tech N9ne's official website that Skatterman & Snug Brim had decided to leave the Strange Music label after fulfilling their two-album commitment.
Bigg Shot Music & Films.
After leaving Strange Music in early 2009, The duo revealed that they had started a new Independent Record Label, Bigg Shot Music & Films.
Plans for a new Skatterman & Snug Brim album were also included in this release, indicating that their third album "Perseverance" would be released through the label on September 1 via a two-album distribution deal with RYKO/Warner Bros. However, plans for the album were later dropped due to Snug Brim's decision to go back to school and work towards a 15 month certification in music marketing. 
With "BIGGSHOT Music & Films", Skatterman released the inaugural Mixtape “This is Kansas City; Vol. 1(2010)”Skatterman also moved forward and released "The Cookbook; Recipe One,". and also the highly anticipated follow-up, "The Cook Book:Recipe Two" (2012), the industry veteran, breaks new barriers and provides fans with a little more insight into life away from his previous label base. Now after over 700 shows with Tech N9ne, Mims, Lil Flip and Paul Wall among others, Skatterman has already left his own indelible mark on the music game.

Billy Pearce

Billy Pearce (born 1 February 1951) is an award winning English performer, comedian, actor and entertainer. A regular on UK television in the 1980s and 1990s, Pearce has been described as a "supreme entertainer". His summer shows and pantomimes regularly break box office records.
Early life.
Pearce was born in Leeds in 1951. His father was a pianist and his mother Jean was a respected dance teacher, notably teaching a young Malandra Burrows to perform. He took up ballet as a child, developing a penchant for performing after appearing in amateur productions for Leeds Thespians and operatic companies. Despite this, Pearce had aspirations to be an engineer originally. This changed after he had a serious motorbike accident, which altered his outlook on life. He has explained, "From then on I couldn't settle and I did lots of different jobs. I'd never been out of Leeds and the surgeon who operated on me let me stay at his place on an island in the Adriatic. I was the only British person on the island. All those things changed my life and I couldn't settle after that. I certainly couldn't go back to working in an engineering factory day after day [...] I didn't know what I wanted to do. I just drifted." He moved to Iceland for a period, worked on fish docks, was a dresser for Yorkshire Television and a stage hand at Leeds Grand. Pearce, who had always loved entertaining people, then found employment as a redcoat for the British holiday camp Butlins in 1970, with a friend who had attended his mother’s dancing school; together they formed a musical double act, known as the Stewart Brothers. Stanley Joseph of Leeds City Varieties was impressed by the act and got them a booking playing alternate nights at a cabaret club in Barnsley and the Fiesta club in Sheffield. Pearce then went solo and set his sights on becoming a club-filler.
Career in showbusiness.
Pearce began his career in mainstream showbusiness as a "variety entertainer". He first rose to prominence when he appeared in the televised talent show "New Faces" in 1986, where he reached the final. Due to his success on the show, Pearce began to appear more regularly on stage and television throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He worked with Danny La Rue and was the compere for comedy double act Cannon and Ball. He has also starred in his own "summer spectacular" entitled "The Billy Pearce Laughter Show" at Blackpool's Grand Theatre and at Bournemouth's BIC when he appeared in Summertime Special in August 1988, (televised).
In 1989, Pearce fronted his own BBC television series, "You gotta be joking", and he appeared regularly as a guest on numerous game shows, entertainment and chat shows. He has been invited to appear at the "Royal Variety Performance" (first appearing in 1991), and 'the "Children's Royal Variety Performance", which he had been chosen to host in 1993. As of 2008, Pearce has performed in five children's Royal Variety shows and three Royal Variety shows in total. Successful in the variety entertainment genre, in 1994 he won the "British Comedy Award" for "Top Theatre Variety Performer", beating popular personalities of the time, such as Ken Dodd and Michael Barrymore. That same year he also received the Sir James Carreras Award for "Outstanding New Talent". Prior to this he was voted Club Mirror's solo comedian of the year by fellow professionals in 1988, and followed this with best television comedy newcomer at the London Palladium.
He has been a regular on stage, performing a summer season with acts such as Tommy Trinder at the Spa Pavilion, Felixstowe, and topping the bill at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool in 1993. He completed two summer seasons at the Grand Theatre Blackpool in 2000 and 2001, originally with John Inman and then with Joe Longthorne and Keith Harris, starred at the Pavilion Theatre, Weymouth in 1994, and at the Futurist Theatre, Scarborough, in 1995. He has also headlined in numerous pantomimes, topping the bill and breaking successive box office records at the Alhambra Theatre, Bradford in "Aladdin" (1994–1995), as Buttons in "Cinderella" (1997), alongside Amanda Barrie in "Snow White" (2002–2003), and in "Jack and the Beanstalk" at the Hull New Theatre (2001–2002). From 2003-2004 he appeared once again at Bradford Alhambra in the highest grossing pantomime in its history.
Pearce has acted on television in shows such as ITV's "Heartbeat" in 2001, and in 2004 he turned to musical theatre, appearing in "Boogie Nights" as Roddie O'Neil at Blackpool's Grand Theatre. At the time he commented, "A musical is something I've always wanted to do but people said: ‘No, you're a comic, that's what you do. They said the same thing when I was wanting to try pantomime: ‘You're a club comic.' I just want the opportunity to show people what I can do." He went on to star in the musical, the "Rocky Horror Show" in 2007 as the guest narrator.
2008 saw Billy performing at Bridlington Spa Theatre, Blackpool Tower and Skegness Embassy Theatre in 'Billy Pearce's Big Night Out' along with Neil Hurst and Safire (illusionists)
In 2009 Billy toured theatres in the UK in Comedy Night Out Tour with Jimmy Cricket and Mick Miller and also starred in The Billy Pearce Laughter Show at the North Pier Blackpool which broke box office records and was voted the best show in Blackpool 2009.
In September 2010, appeared in Morley Amateur Operatic Society's production of "Return to the Forbidden Planet" as the newsreader.
2010 saw Billy return to the North Pier alongside Guy Barrett, son of well known Norman Barrett, Neil Hurst and Leanne Fury 
In 2011 Billy moved his Laughter show from North Pier to the Grand Theatre, Blackpool bringing Neil Hurst with him and Emma Gilmour. During this season Billy Pearce celebrated his 1000th performance on stage at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool
Catchphrase.
In many of Billy Pearce's Summer shows and pantomimes, he uses the catchphrase "Hiya Boys and Girls" to much comic effect. He often displays a silly accent or voice to heighten this effect.
He famously uses the word 'Chuffin'
On TV he often used 'I will tell you when!' (For laughing at his jokes and applause etc.)
Charity work.
On 25 February 2012, Pearce became the second patron of Yorkshire Children's Trust, a Yorkshire charity offering grants to families with sick or disabled children.

In addition to the songwriting and produce for the entire album, she also participated in arrangement for the first time, except five songs which were arranged by Takayuki Inoue and featured in the latter half of the LP. 
The final track on "Hunch" became one of fan favorites for years, though none of the contents were released as a single when the album came out. "Fight" later appeared as a double A-Side of a chart topper single "Between the Sky and You", released in 1994 and sold over a million copies. The song which became well-known because of commercial success of a single has been covered several times, interpreted by artists such as Takuro Yoshida, Noriyuki Makihara and Masaharu Fukuyama
"Hunch" debuted at the number-one on the Japanese Oricon and retained the position for 3 weeks, but quickly fell off the chart compared to its predecessors that likewise reached the top.

Schlebusch Commission

The Schlebusch Commission was a parliamentary commission established in 1972 by the South African government of Prime Minister BJ Vorster to investigate four anti-apartheid civil society organizations.
The recommendations of the Schlebusch Commission enabled the promulgation of the Affected Organisations Act (1974), with which the state could declare an organization "affected." An affected organization was denied foreign funding, while its funds and documents were seized. As a result, organizational activities were severely curtailed or effectively halted, as happened, respectively, with the National Union of South African Students on the one hand, and the Christian Institute of Southern Africa and the University Christian Movement on the other. 
History.
Formally called The Commission of Inquiry into Certain Organisations, its colloquial name referred to its chair, Alwyn Schlebusch, National Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Kroonstad in the Orange Free State (1962-80). 
The Schlebusch Commission was set up with the express purpose of investigating the Christian Institute of Southern Africa, the South African Institute of Race Relations, the University Christian Movement and the National Union of South African Students. "There was no charge sheet, witnesses were unaware of other evidence given, and were unable to cross-examine or lead evidence" (Merrett 1995:60). Among the commission's more prominent members was Kobie Coetsee, National Party MP for Bloemfontein and later Minister of Justice.
The influence of the Commission extended for over a decade, with Schlebusch warning the South African Council of Churches not to speak out against security legislation, fund political trials, or support political detainees.
Commission reports and their consequences.
The commission's released its 4th interim report on 12 August 1974, dealing with the National Union of South African Students (Nusas), with particular attention to its Wages Commission. Consequently, Nusas and its affiliates were declared an affected organisation on 13 September, and its foreign funding cut off. 
The commission's 5th interim report declared South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) publications to be propaganda, but the organization was not deemed "affected".
In May 1975 the Christian Institute of Southern Africa (CI) was declared affected. 
Employees who declined to provide evidence to the commission against their organizations were charged in court and some were convicted. Four SAIRR and nine CI officials were charged for refusing to give evidence. Because the state refused to make the commission's findings available to court, proceedings were often delayed.
Other Schlebusch commissions.
In 1980 the state convened the Commission of Inquiry on the Constitution, with Schlebusch as chair.
In 1985 Schlebusch chaired a commission that examined remuneration of various members of government.

Sterkfontein Dam

The Sterkfontein Dam, located just outside the town of Harrismith, in the Free State, province of South Africa, is part of the Tugela-Vaal Water Project, and located on the Nuwejaarspruit, a tributary of the Wilge River in the upper catchment area of the Vaal River.
Characteristics.
The dam receives its water via the Tugela-Vaal Project which is a pumped-storage scheme involving the net transfer of up to 630 million m3 of water from KwaZulu-Natal. This is stored in the Sterkfontein Dam and released to the Vaal Dam via the Wilge River when needed. The Sterkfontein Dam is a highly effective reservoir, since it has the depth to store a large amount of water, with very little loss to evaporation. The Vaal Dam lake (reservoir) by comparison has a large surface area and is relatively shallow, which results in a higher rate of evaporation. The Sterkfontein Dam was originally commissioned in 1977 and comprised 69 m high earthfill embankment 2 290 m long with no spillway. It was subsequently raised in 1980 to its current height of 93 m with a crest length of 3 060 m and a full supply capacity of 2 656 million m3. At full supply, it has a surface area of no more than 70 km2. The extended dam was commissioned in 1980, and has a capacity of , with a surface area of only , the dam wall is high.
The dam wall contains 17 million m3 of material making it the largest dam wall in South Africa with regard to volume, while the reservoir formed by the dam is the third largest in the country.
The dam mainly serves for domestic and industrial use and its hazard potential has been ranked high (3).
The Driekloof Dam next to it, is regarded as a separated dam and reservoir, and is not included in the above figures.
Protected areas.
The Sterkfontein Dam Nature Reserve is a protected area located by the dam.

James Wyley Sessions (11 December 1885 – 21 April 1977) was the first Institute of Religion director in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was sent in 1926 by church president Heber J. Grant to head the Institute of Religion in Moscow, Idaho. Sessions later served as the head of the church's mission home in Salt Lake City, Utah for many years.
In 1921, Sessions became the president of the LDS Church's South African Mission, succeeding Nicholas G. Smith. Sessions continued in this position until 1926, when he returned to Utah and almost immediately was sent to direct the institute in Idaho. Over the next decade, Sessions set up Institutes of Religion at several universities in the western United States. He believed that institutes should offer strong academic classes, social interaction, and be housed in permanent and respectable buildings. In 1935, Sessions was serving as the institute director in Pocatello, Idaho. 
From 1939 to 1947, Sessions was the head of the Division of Religion at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.

Shir shel yom

Shir Shel Yom (שִׁיר שֶׁל יוֹם), meaning "'song' Psalm of day [of the week" consists of one psalm recited daily at the end of the Jewish morning prayer services known as shacharit. Each day of the week possesses a distinct psalm that is referred to by its Hebrew name as the "shir shel yom" and each day's "shir shel yom" is a different paragraph of Psalms.
Although fundamentally similar to the Levite's song that was sung at the Holy Temple in Jerusalem in ancient times, there are some differences between the two.
Rationale.
Each day's "shir shel yom" was chosen for its ties to that day's significance in the week of Creation, as explained by the beraisa that quotes Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Akiva:
Other days.
On holidays, including Chol Hamoed and Rosh Chodesh, the Levites would replace the regular song with one appropriate to the day. However, it is customary to recite only the standard song after Shacharit. Only Rosh Chodesh, most congregations recite the special song (Psalm 104) after the regular shir shel yom. Since in the times of the Temple, the song for the Sabbath would override any other song, many do not recite Psalm 104 if Rosh Chodesh falls out on the Sabbath, although many others do. The Vilna Gaon and others would recite each holiday song at the end of Shacharit, and the song for the weekday earlier in the service.

XHTML

XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) is a family of XML markup languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which web pages are written. 
While HTML (prior to HTML5) was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a very flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. Because XHTML documents need to be well-formed, they can be parsed using standard XML parsers—unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser. 
XHTML 1.0 became a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation on January 26, 2000. XHTML 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. XHTML5 is undergoing development as of September 2009, as part of the HTML5 specification.
Overview.
XHTML 1.0 is "a reformulation of the three HTML 4 document types as applications of XML 1.0". The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) also continues to maintain the HTML 4.01 Recommendation, and the specifications for HTML5 and XHTML5 are being actively developed. In the current XHTML 1.0 Recommendation document, as published and revised to August 2002, the W3C commented that, "The XHTML family is the next step in the evolution of the Internet. By migrating to XHTML today, content developers can enter the XML world with all of its attendant benefits, while still remaining confident in their content's backward and future compatibility."
However, in 2005, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) formed, independently of the W3C, to work on advancing ordinary HTML not based on XHTML. The WHATWG eventually began working on a standard that supported both XML and non-XML serializations, HTML5, in parallel to W3C standards such as XHTML 2. In 2007, the W3C's HTML working group voted to officially recognize HTML5 and work on it as the next-generated HTML standard. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2 Working Group's charter to expire, acknowledging that HTML5 would be the sole next-generation HTML standard, including both XML and non-XML serializations. Of the two serializations, the W3C suggests that most authors use the HTML syntax, rather than the XHTML syntax.
Motivation.
XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and increase interoperability with other data formats. HTML 4 was ostensibly an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML); however the specification for SGML was complex, and neither web browsers nor the HTML 4 Recommendation were fully conformant to it. The XML standard, approved in 1998, provided a simpler data format closer in simplicity to HTML 4. By shifting to an XML format, it was hoped HTML would become compatible with common XML tools; servers and proxies would be able to transform content, as necessary, for constrained devices such as mobile phones.
By using namespaces, XHTML documents could provide extensibility by including fragments from other XML-based languages such as Scalable Vector Graphics and MathML. Finally, the renewed work would provide an opportunity to divide HTML into reusable components (XHTML Modularization) and clean up untidy parts of the language.
Relationship to HTML.
There are various differences between XHTML and HTML. The Document Object Model is a tree structure that represents the page internally in applications, and XHTML and HTML are two different ways of representing that in markup (serializations). Both are less expressive than the DOM (for example, "--" may be placed in comments in the DOM, but cannot be represented in a comment in either XHTML or HTML), and generally XHTML's XML syntax is a little more expressive than HTML (for example, arbitrary namespaces are not allowed in HTML). First off, one source of differences is immediate: XHTML uses an XML syntax, while HTML uses a pseudo-SGML syntax (officially SGML for HTML 4 and under, but never in practice, and standardised away from SGML in HTML5). Secondly however, because the expressible contents of the DOM in syntax are slightly different, there are some changes in actual behavior between the two models.
First, there are some differences in syntax:
Secondly, in contrast to these minor syntactical differences, there are some behavioral differences, mostly arising from the underlying differences in serialization. For example:
Adoption.
The similarities between HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 led many web sites and content management systems to adopt the initial W3C XHTML 1.0 Recommendation. To aid authors in the transition, the W3C provided guidance on how to publish XHTML 1.0 documents in an HTML-compatible manner, and serve them to browsers that were not designed for XHTML.
Such "HTML-compatible" content is sent using the HTML media type (codice_13) rather than the official Internet media type for XHTML (codice_14). When measuring the adoption of XHTML to that of regular HTML, therefore, it is important to distinguish whether it is media type usage or actual document contents that is being compared.
Most web browsers have mature support for all of the possible XHTML media types. The notable exception is Internet Explorer versions 8 and earlier by Microsoft; rather than rendering codice_14 content, a dialog box invites the user to save the content to disk instead. Both Internet Explorer 7 (released in 2006) and Internet Explorer 8 (released in March 2009) exhibit this behavior. Microsoft developer Chris Wilson explained in 2005 that IE7’s priorities were improved browser security and CSS support, and that proper XHTML support would be difficult to graft onto IE’s compatibility-oriented HTML parser; however, Microsoft added support for true XHTML in IE9.
As long as support is not widespread, most web developers avoid using XHTML that is not HTML-compatible, so advantages of XML such as namespaces, faster parsing and smaller-footprint browsers do not benefit the user.
Criticism.
In the early 2000s, some web developers began to question why Web authors ever made the leap into authoring in XHTML. Others countered that the problems ascribed to the use of XHTML could mostly be attributed to two main sources: the production of invalid XHTML documents by some Web authors and the lack of support for XHTML built into Internet Explorer 6. They went on to describe the benefits of XML-based Web documents (i.e. XHTML) regarding searching, indexing and parsing as well as future-proofing the Web itself.
In October 2006, HTML inventor and W3C chair Tim Berners-Lee, introducing a major W3C effort to develop a new HTML specification, posted in his blog that, "The attempt to get the world to switch to XML … all at once didn't work. The large HTML-generating public did not move … Some large communities did shift and are enjoying the fruits of well-formed systems … The plan is to charter a completely new HTML group." The current HTML5 working draft says "special attention has been given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability … while at the same time updating the HTML specifications to address issues raised in the past few years." Ian Hickson, editor of the HTML5 specification criticising the improper use of XHTML in 2002, is a member of the group developing this specification and is listed as one of the co-editors of the current working draft.
Simon Pieters researched the XML-compliance of mobile browsers and concluded “the claim that XHTML would be needed for mobile devices is simply a myth”.
Versions of XHTML.
XHTML 1.0.
December 1998 saw the publication of a W3C Working Draft entitled "Reformulating HTML in XML". This introduced Voyager, the codename for a new markup language based on HTML 4, but adhering to the stricter syntax rules of XML. By February 1999 the name of the specification had changed to "XHTML 1.0: The Extensible HyperText Markup Language", and in January 2000 it was officially adopted as a W3C Recommendation. There are three formal DTDs for XHTML 1.0, corresponding to the three different versions of HTML 4.01:
The second edition of XHTML 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation in August 2002.
Modularization of XHTML.
Modularization provides an abstract collection of components through which XHTML can be subsetted and extended. The feature is intended to help XHTML extend its reach onto emerging platforms, such as mobile devices and Web-enabled televisions. The initial draft of "Modularization of XHTML" became available in April 1999, and reached Recommendation status in April 2001.
The first modular XHTML variants were XHTML 1.1 and XHTML Basic 1.0.
In October 2008 "Modularization of XHTML" was superseded by "XHTML Modularization 1.1", which adds an XML Schema implementation. It was itself superseded by a second edition in July 2010.
XHTML 1.1: Module-based XHTML.
XHTML 1.1 evolved out of the work surrounding the initial "Modularization of XHTML" specification. The W3C released a first draft in September 1999; Recommendation status was reached in May 2001. The modules combined within XHTML 1.1 effectively recreate XHTML 1.0 Strict, with the addition of ruby annotation elements (codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22, codice_23 and codice_24) to better support East-Asian languages. Other changes include removal of the codice_25 attribute from the codice_26 and codice_27 elements, and (in the first edition of the language) removal of the codice_28 attribute in favour of codice_29.
Although XHTML 1.1 is largely compatible with XHTML 1.0 and HTML 4, in August 2002 the Working Group issued a formal Note advising that it should not be transmitted with the HTML media type. With limited browser support for the alternate codice_14 media type, XHTML 1.1 proved unable to gain widespread use. In January 2009 a second edition of the document ("XHTML Media Types - Second Edition") was issued, relaxing this restriction and allowing XHTML 1.1 to be served as codice_13.
A second edition of XHTML 1.1 was issued on 23 November 2010, which addresses various errata and adds an XML Schema implementation not included in the original specification. (It was first released briefly on 7 May 2009 as a "Proposed Edited Recommendation" before being rescinded on 19 May due to unresolved issues.)
Of all the versions of XHTML, XHTML Basic 1.0 provides the fewest features. With XHTML 1.1, it is one of the two first implementations of modular XHTML. In addition to the Core Modules (Structure, Text, Hypertext, and List), it implements the following abstract modules: Base, Basic Forms, Basic Tables, Image, Link, Metainformation, Object, Style Sheet, and Target.
XHTML Basic 1.1 replaces the Basic Forms Module with the Forms Module, and adds the Intrinsic Events, Presentation, and Scripting modules. It also supports additional tags and attributes from other modules. This version became a W3C recommendation on 29 July 2008.
The current version of XHTML Basic is 1.1 Second Edition (23 November 2010), in which the language is re-implemented in the W3C's XML Schema language. This version also supports the codice_28 attribute.
XHTML-Print.
XHTML-Print, which became a W3C Recommendation in September 2006, is a specialized version of XHTML Basic designed for documents printed from information appliances to low-end printers.
XHTML Mobile Profile.
XHTML Mobile Profile (abbreviated XHTML MP or XHTML-MP) is a third-party variant of the W3C's XHTML Basic specification. Like XHTML Basic, XHTML was developed for information appliances with limited system resources.
In October 2001, a limited company called the Wireless Application Protocol Forum began adapting XHTML Basic for WAP 2.0, the second major version of the Wireless Application Protocol. WAP Forum based their DTD on the W3C's Modularization of XHTML, incorporating the same modules the W3C used in XHTML Basic 1.0—except for the Target Module. Starting with this foundation, the WAP Forum replaced the Basic Forms Module with a partial implementation of the Forms Module, added partial support for the Legacy and Presentation modules, and added full support for the Style Attribute Module.
In 2002, the WAP Forum was subsumed into the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), which continued to develop XHTML Mobile Profile as a component of their OMA Browsing Specification.
XHTML Mobile Profile 1.1.
To this version, finalized in 2004, the OMA added partial support for the Scripting Module, and partial support for Intrinsic Events. XHTML MP 1.1 is part of v2.1 of the OMA Browsing Specification (1 November 2002).
XHTML Mobile Profile 1.2.
This version, finalized 27 February 2007, expands the capabilities of XHTML MP 1.1 with full support for the Forms Module and OMA Text Input Modes. XHTML MP 1.2 is part of v2.3 of the OMA Browsing Specification (13 March 2007).
XHTML Mobile Profile 1.3.
XHTML MP 1.3 (finalized on 23 September 2008) uses the XHTML Basic 1.1 document type definition, which includes the Target Module. Events in this version of the specification are updated to DOM Level 3 specifications (i.e., they are platform- and language-neutral).
XHTML 1.2.
The XHTML 2 Working Group considered the creation of a new language based on XHTML 1.1. If XHTML 1.2 was created, it would include WAI-ARIA and codice_33 attributes to better support accessible web applications, and improved Semantic Web support through RDFa. The codice_34 attribute from XHTML Basic 1.1, along with the codice_35 attribute (for specifying frame targets) might also be present. The XHTML2 WG had not been chartered to carry out the development of XHTML1.2. Since the W3C announced that it does not intend to recharter the XHTML2 WG, and closed the WG in December 2010, this means that XHTML 1.2 proposal would not eventuate.
XHTML 2.0.
Between August 2002 and July 2006, the W3C released eight Working Drafts of XHTML 2.0, a new version of XHTML able to make a clean break from the past by discarding the requirement of backward compatibility. This lack of compatibility with XHTML 1.x and HTML 4 caused some early controversy in the web developer community. Some parts of the language (such as the codice_33 and RDFa attributes) were subsequently split out of the specification and worked on as separate modules, partially to help make the transition from XHTML 1.x to XHTML 2.0 smoother. A ninth draft of XHTML 2.0 was expected to appear in 2009, but on July 2, 2009, the W3C decided to let the XHTML2 Working Group charter expire by that year's end, effectively halting any further development of the draft into a standard. Instead, XHTML 2.0 and its related documents were released as W3C Notes.
New features to have been introduced by XHTML 2.0 included:
XHTML5.
HTML5 initially grew independently of the W3C, through a loose group of browser manufacturers and other interested parties calling themselves the WHATWG, or Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. The WHATWG announced the existence of an open mailing list in June 2004, along with a website bearing the strapline “Maintaining and evolving HTML since 2004.” The key motive of the group was to create a platform for dynamic web applications; they considered XHTML 2.0 to be too document-centric, and not suitable for the creation of internet forum sites or online shops.
In April 2007, the Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software joined Apple in requesting that the newly rechartered HTML Working Group of the W3C adopt the work, under the name of HTML5. The group resolved to do this the following month, and the First Public Working Draft of HTML5 was issued by the W3C in January 2008. The most recent W3C Working Draft was published in January 2011.
HTML5 has both a regular codice_13 serialization and an XML serialization, which is known as XHTML5. In addition to the markup language, the specification includes a number of application programming interfaces. The Document Object Model is extended with APIs for editing, drag-and-drop, data storage and network communication.
The language is more compatible with HTML 4 and XHTML 1.x than XHTML 2.0, due to the decision to keep the existing HTML form elements and events model. It adds many new elements not found in XHTML 1.x, however, such as codice_57 and codice_58.
The most recent draft includes WAI-ARIA support.
Semantic content in XHTML.
XHTML+RDFa is an extended version of the XHTML markup language for supporting RDF through a collection of attributes and processing rules in the form of well-formed XML documents. This host language is one of the techniques used to develop Semantic Web content by embedding rich semantic markup.
Valid XHTML documents.
An XHTML document that conforms to an XHTML specification is said to be "valid". Validity assures consistency in document code, which in turn eases processing, but does not necessarily ensure consistent rendering by browsers. A document can be checked for validity with the W3C Markup Validation Service. In practice, many web development programs provide code validation based on the W3C standards.
Root element.
The root element of an XHTML document must be codice_59, and must contain an codice_60 attribute to associate it with the XHTML namespace. The namespace URI for XHTML is codice_61. The example tag below additionally features an codice_29 attribute to identify the document with a natural language:
DOCTYPEs.
In order to validate an XHTML document, a Document Type Declaration, or "DOCTYPE", may be used. A DOCTYPE declares to the browser the Document Type Definition (DTD) to which the document conforms. A Document Type Declaration should be placed before the root element.
The system identifier part of the DOCTYPE, which in these examples is the URL that begins with "http://", need only point to a copy of the DTD to use, if the validator cannot locate one based on the public identifier (the other quoted string). It does not need to be the specific URL that is in these examples; in fact, authors are encouraged to use local copies of the DTD files when possible. The public identifier, however, must be character-for-character the same as in the examples.
XML declaration.
A character encoding may be specified at the beginning of an XHTML document in the XML declaration when the document is served using the codice_14 MIME type. (If an XML document lacks encoding specification, an XML parser assumes that the encoding is UTF-8 or UTF-16, unless the encoding has already been determined by a higher protocol.)
For example:
The declaration may be optionally omitted because it declares as its encoding the default encoding. However, if the document instead makes use of XML 1.1 or another character encoding, a declaration is necessary. Internet Explorer prior to version 7 enters quirks mode, if it encounters an XML declaration in a document served as codice_13.
Common errors.
Some of the most common errors in the usage of XHTML are:
Backward compatibility.
XHTML 1.x documents are mostly backward compatible with HTML 4 user agents when the appropriate guidelines are followed. XHTML 1.1 is essentially compatible, although the elements for ruby annotation are not part of the HTML 4 specification and thus generally ignored by HTML 4 browsers. Later XHTML 1.x modules such as those for the codice_33 attribute, RDFa and WAI-ARIA degrade gracefully in a similar manner.
XHTML 2.0 is significantly less compatible, although this can be mitigated to some degree through the use of scripting. (This can be simple one-liners, such as the use of “codice_96” to register a new HTML element within Internet Explorer, or complete JavaScript frameworks, such as the FormFaces implementation of XForms.)
Examples.
The following are examples of XHTML 1.0 Strict, with both having the same visual output. The former one follows the HTML Compatibility Guidelines of the XHTML Media Types Note while the latter one breaks backward compatibility, but provides cleaner markup.
Example 1.
Example 2.
Notes:
Cross-compatibility of XHTML and HTML.
HTML5 and XHTML5 serializations are largely inter-compatible if adhering to the stricter XHTML5 syntax, but there are some cases in which XHTML will not work as valid HTML5 (e.g., processing instructions are deprecated in , are treated as comments, and close on the first ">", whereas they are fully allowed in XML, are treated as their own type, and close on "codice_1").

Brooke Shields

Brooke Shields (born May 31, 1965) is an American actress, model and former child star. Shields, initially a child model, gained critical acclaim for her leading role in Louis Malle's controversial film "Pretty Baby" (1978), in which she played a child prostitute in New Orleans at the turn of the 20th century. The role garnered Shields widespread notoriety, and she continued to model into her late teenage years and starred in several dramas in the 1980s, including "The Blue Lagoon" (1980), and Franco Zeffirelli's "Endless Love" (1981).
In 1983, Shields abandoned her career as a model to attend Princeton University, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in French literature. In the 1990s, Shields returned to acting, appearing in minor roles in films, and starred in the titular role of the sitcom "Suddenly Susan", which ran for four seasons between 1996 and 2000. Most recently, Shields has made appearances in other television shows, including "That '70s Show" and "Lipstick Jungle".
Early life.
Brooke Christa Shields was born in New York City to Frank (1941-2003) and Teri (née Schmon; 1933-2012) Shields. Through her father's side, she has Italian, French, Irish, and English roots, along with high social position and relations to nobility. According to a research by William Addams Reitwiesner published in 1995, Brooke Shields has ancestral links with a number of noble families from Italy, in particular from Genoa and Rome. These are namely (in chronological order of descent from 1355 to 1965) the Gattilusi-Palaiologos-Savoy; Grimaldi; Imperiali; Carafa; Doria; Doria-Pamphili-Landi; Chigi-Albani; and Torlonia dynasties. Her paternal grandmother was the Italian princess Donna Marina Torlonia (Donna Marina was the daughter of an Italian nobleman and an American socialite). Shields' mother was of German, English, Scots-Irish, and Welsh descent. Shields was raised in the Roman Catholic faith.
When her mother Teri first announced that she was pregnant, her father Frank's family paid her a sum to terminate the pregnancy. Instead, Teri took the money, but gave birth to their daughter Brooke regardless. Frank married Teri, but they were divorced when Brooke was five months old. She has two stepbrothers and three half-sisters.
When Shields was five days old, her mother openly stated she wanted her to be active in show business: "She's the most beautiful child and I'm going to help her with her career."
For her confirmation in the Roman Catholic Church at age 10, she took the name "Camille". While attending high school, she resided in Haworth, New Jersey.
Education.
She attended the New Lincoln School until eighth grade. Shields graduated from The Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, New Jersey, in 1983. She moved to a dorm at Princeton University to pursue her bachelor's degree in French literature, where she graduated in 1987.
At Princeton, she spoke openly about her sexuality and virginity. Shields was a member of the Princeton Triangle Club and the Cap and Gown Club. Her autobiography, "On Your Own", was published in 1985. Her 1987 senior thesis was titled "The Initiation: From Innocence to Experience: The Pre-Adolescent/Adolescent Journey in the Films of Louis Malle, "Pretty Baby" and "Lacombe Lucien"."
On the op-ed page of "The New York Times", her academic record was scrutinized after she had publicized her school records in the July 1987 edition of "Life Magazine" shortly after graduation from Princeton. Shields was criticized for not having taken any courses in history, mathematics, philosophy, economics, world literature or science with laboratory experience.
Career.
Early work.
Shields began her career as a model in 1966, when she was 11 months old. Her first job was for Ivory Soap, shot by Francesco Scavullo. She continued as a successful child model with model agent Eileen Ford, who, in her Lifetime Network biography, stated that she started her children's division just for Shields. In 1978, when she was 12-years-old, Shields played a child prostitute her age in film "Pretty Baby". Eileen Ford, founder of the Ford Modeling Agency, said of Brooke Shields: "She is a professional child and unique. She looks like an adult and thinks like one."
In 1980, the 14-year-old Shields was the youngest fashion model ever to appear on the cover of "Vogue". Later that same year, Shields appeared in controversial print and TV ads for Calvin Klein jeans. The TV ad included her saying the famous tagline, "You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing." Brooke Shields ads would help catapult Klein's career to super-designer status.
From 1981 to 1983, Shields, her mother, photographer Gary Gross, Playboy Press and the New York City Courts were involved in litigation over the rights to some photographs her mother had signed away to the photographer (when dealing with models who are also minors, a parent or legal guardian must sign such a release form while other agreements are subject to negotiation) which were originally intended to appear in a book titled "Sugar and Spice" to be published by Playboy Press. The courts ruled in favor of the photographer, but due to a strange twist in New York law, it would have been otherwise had Brooke Shields been considered a child "performer" rather than a model.
By the age of 16, Shields had become one of the most recognizable faces in the world, because of her dual career as a provocative fashion model and controversial child actress. "Time" magazine reported, in its February 9, 1981, cover story, that her day rate as a model was $10,000. In 1983, Shields appeared on the cover of the September issue of Paris "Vogue", the October and November issues of American "Vogue" and the December edition of Italian "Vogue". During that period Shields became a regular at New York City's nightclub Studio 54. In 2009, a naked picture of Brooke Shields, taken when she was 10, and included in a work by Richard Prince, "Spiritual America", created a row. It was removed from an exhibition at the Tate Modern after a warning from the police.
Film.
Shields' first major film role was an appearance in Louis Malle's "Pretty Baby" (1978), a movie in which she played a child who lived in a brothel (in which there were numerous nude scenes). As she was only 12 years old when the film was released, controversy regarding child pornography arose. This was followed by a slightly less controversial and less notable film, "Wanda Nevada" (1979).
After two decades of movies, her best known films are still arguably "The Blue Lagoon" (1980), which included nude scenes between teenage lovers on a tropical island (Shields later testified before a U.S. Congressional inquiry that older body doubles were used in some of them), and "Endless Love" (1981). The MPAA initially rated "Endless Love" with an X rating. The film was re-edited to earn an R rating. She won the People's Choice Award in the category of Favorite Young Performer in four consecutive years from 1981 to 1984. In 1998, she played a lesbian, Lily, in "The Misadventures of Margaret".
In 2001, Lifetime aired the film "What Makes a Family", starring Brooke Shields and Cherry Jones in a true-to-life story of two married lesbian mothers and a baby versus the adoption laws of Florida.
Television appearances.
Shields has appeared in a number of television shows. In 1980, she was the youngest guest star to ever appear on "The Muppet Show", in which she and the Muppets put on their own version of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". She was also the youngest person to host ABC's "Fridays", a "Saturday Night Live"-like sketch comedy show, in 1981. In one episode of the popular comedy sitcom "Friends", Shields played Joey's stalker. This role led directly to her being cast in the NBC sitcom "Suddenly Susan", in which she starred from 1996 until 2000, and which earned a People's Choice Award in the category of Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series for her, in 1997, and two Golden Globe nominations.
In the early 1980s, she starred in the USPHS PSA sponsored by the American Lung Association as an initiative that VIPs should become examples and advocates of non-smoking. In the mid-1980s, Brooke began her support of the USO by touring with Bob Hope.
Shields made a couple of guest appearances on "That '70s Show". She played Pam Burkhart, Jackie's (Mila Kunis) mother, who later was briefly involved with Donna's (Laura Prepon) father (played by Don Stark). Shields left "That '70s Show" when her character was written out. Shields recorded the narration for the Sony/BMG recording of "The Runaway Bunny", a Concerto for Violin, Orchestra and Reader, by Glen Roven. It was performed by the Royal Philharmonic and Ittai Shapira.
In the late 2000s, Shields guest-starred on shows like FX's "Nip/Tuck" and CBS' "Two and a Half Men". In 2005, Shields appeared in a season-two episode of HBO's "Entourage", entitled "Blue Balls Lagoon." In 2007, she made a guest appearance on Disney's "Hannah Montana", playing Susan Stewart, Miley and Jackson's mother, who died in 2004. In 2008, she returned in the primetime drama "Lipstick Jungle." The series ended a year later.
In 2010 and 2012, she made guest appearances on "The Middle" as the mother of a brood of terror-inducing children and the nemesis of Frankie Heck (played by Patricia Heaton). She also appeared as a featured celebrity in NBC's genealogy documentary reality series, "Who Do You Think You Are?", where it was revealed that, through her father's ancestry, she is the distant cousin (many generations removed) of King Louis XIV of France, and thus a descendant of both Saint Louis and Henry IV of France.
Starting in 2013, Shields has been an occasional guest co-host in the 9:00 hour of "Today" on NBC.
Theatre.
Shields has appeared in several Broadway theatre productions, including the musicals "Grease" (1994 revival) as Betty Rizzo, the 1998 revival of "Cabaret" (in 2001), the 2003 revival of "Wonderful Town" (in 2004-2005) and "Chicago". She also performed in "Chicago" in London's West End. She took over the role of "Morticia" in the Broadway musical "The Addams Family" on June 28, 2011.
Personal life.
In the June 2009 issue of "Health" magazine, Shields related that she lost her virginity at age 22. She said it would have occurred earlier had she had a better self-image.
In the mid-1980s while at Princeton, Shields dated classmate Dean Cain. Shields has also been linked to John F. Kennedy Jr, actor Liam Neeson and singer George Michael. She was also a favorite date of Prince Naruhito of Japan. After a romantic interlude with John Travolta, the 16-year-old Brooke Shields dated 18-year-old Mohammed, son of the arms-dealer billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, in Cannes where they first met. At 18, Brooke Shields met Dodi Fayed and they became friends. Shields was 24 years old when she spent the evening with Dodi Fayed in Paris to celebrate his 33rd birthday.
In the 1990s, Shields promoted physical fitness as an extension of femininity, maintaining that femininity and athletics are compatible. Although she was not the only woman doing so, Shields had what was required to promote women's athletics.
Shields is also a well-known vegan and an animal rights activist. However, despite coming out against the fur industry in 1989, Shields later went on to create her own mink fur coat at Kopenhagen Fur. She came under the scrutiny of animal rights organizations such as PETA for this visit, which prompted media attention.
Shields has been married twice. From April 19, 1997, to April 9, 1999, she was married to professional tennis player Andre Agassi; the couple had been together since 1993. On April 4, 2001, she married television writer Chris Henchy after they met in 1999 through mutual friends. The couple has two daughters. She is a spokeswoman for Tupperware's Chain of Confidence SMART Girls campaign, a program that teaches girls to nurture their mental and physical well-being.
Postpartum depression.
Between April and May 2005, Shields spoke to magazines (such as "Guideposts") and appeared on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" to publicize her battle with postpartum depression, an experience that included depression, thoughts of suicide, an inability to respond to her baby's needs and delayed maternal bonding. The illness may have been triggered by a traumatic childbirth, the death of her father three weeks earlier, stress from in vitro fertilization, a miscarriage and a family history of depression, as well as the hormones and life changes which were brought on by childbirth. Her book, "Down Came the Rain", discusses her experience, contributing to a greater public awareness of postpartum depression.
In May 2005, Tom Cruise, a Scientologist whose beliefs frown upon psychiatry, condemned Brooke, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking in favor of the antidepressant drug Paxil. As Cruise said, "Here is a woman and I care about Brooke Shields, because I think she is an incredibly talented woman, you look at think, where has her career gone?" Shields responded that Cruise's statements about anti-depressants were "irresponsible" and "dangerous." She said that he should "stick to fighting aliens" (a reference to Cruise's starring role in "War of the Worlds" as well as some of the more exotic aspects of Scientology doctrine and teachings), "and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression." The actress responded to a further attack by Cruise in an essay "War of Words" published in "The New York Times" on July 1, 2005, in which she made an individual case for the medication and said, "In a strange way, it was comforting to me when my obstetrician told me that my feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. Once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. With a doctor's care, I have since tapered off the medication but, without it, I wouldn't have become the loving parent I am today." On August 31, 2006, according to USAToday.com, Cruise privately apologized to Shields for the incident and Shields accepted and said that it was "heartfelt." Three months later, she and her husband attended the wedding of Cruise and Katie Holmes, in November 2006.
Relationship with Michael Jackson.
Brooke Shields spoke at the memorial service for Michael Jackson on July 7, 2009. Shields stated in that speech that she first met Michael when she was 13 years old, and the two instantly became friends. Shields said: 
In her eulogy, she shared anecdotes, including an occasion in which she was his date for one of Elizabeth Taylor's weddings, and the pair sneaked into Taylor's room to get the first look at her dress, only to discover Taylor asleep in the bed. Shields gave a tearful speech, referring to the many times she and Michael Jackson shared and briefly joked about his famous sequin glove. She also mentioned Jackson’s favorite song "Smile" by Charlie Chaplin which was later sung in the memorial service by Jermaine Jackson.
"New York Times" columnist Gail Collins wrote that "it was a little peculiar hearing Brooke Shields’s weepy testimony about her deep friendship with Jackson given the fact that she told reporters that the last time she saw him was at Elizabeth Taylor’s eighth wedding in 1991." Jackson stated in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey that he was dating Shields at the time. Shields has stated that Jackson asked her to marry him numerous times and to adopt a child together. 
Jackson said of Shields in a conversation with Rabbi Shmuley Boteach in 2001:

Duberria lutrix

Duberria lutrix, or the common slug eater, is a small, ovoviviparous, molluscivorous, nonvenomous snake, which is endemic to Africa.
Description.
Total length of adults is thirty to forty cm (approximately twelve to sixteen inches). 
The common slug eaters' colours vary, but typically have an olive green to brown or russet back, grey flanks, a yellowish or cream belly, and a black, more or less complete, vertebral stripe.
Geographic range.
This species is found in Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.
Subspecies.
Six subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies.
Diet.
As the name implies, the common slug eater is a specialised predator and feeds on snails and slugs, mostly finding its prey through chemoreception, using its tongue. It swallows its prey quickly before too much defensive mucus is produced, extracting snails from their shells through the shell opening, or by smashing the shell against a rock while grasping the soft body in its jaws.
Breeding.
The common slug eater usually gives birth to litters of three to twelve young. However, broods from large females may consist of as many as 22 newborns, each measuring eight to eleven cm (3⅛-4¼ inches). The total combined weight of the young may exceed the weight of the female after giving birth. Birthing season is January and February (late summer in southern Africa).
Captivity.
The snake is a popular pet, which feeds and breeds readily, and because of the nature of its prey item, it is easy to keep.
Defense.
When alarmed, the snake secretes a noxious substance from glands near the base of the tail and rolls up into a defensive spiral with the head in the middle, leading to the Afrikaans common name "" ("tobacco roll").

Writtle has undergone significant growth in its research areas, such as the Postharvest Technology unit which carries out trails on fruit and vegetables for major supermarkets.
One of the College research staff, Dr Jon Amory, recently won funding from the BBSRC for the ‘Assessment of Dairy Cow Welfare through Predictive Modelling of Individual and Social Behaviour’.
In 2011, QAA (Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education) identified the College’s overarching commitment to student support as a notable feature of best practice, commending its ‘comprehensive student support system and the demonstrable commitment of staff to the support and enhancement of student learning’. Enhancement was also separately commended as a feature of best practice in its own right, the review observing that: ‘The College’s approach to quality enhancement is characterised by a strategic commitment to improve the quality of students’ learning opportunities linked to the College’s own values and vision.’
The College is also committed to improving the quality and currency of its programmes by using a significant proportion of teaching staff who are actively engaged in research and/or professional practice. The report of the 2011 QAA audit again identified this aspect of Writtle provision for praise, noting as best practice ‘the way in which the curriculum is designed, developed and delivered to take advantage of staff research and professional practice.’
In July 2013, the College made its debut on national BBC television programme Countryfile. The focus for this episode was on the College's groundbreaking research which included a piece with presenter Matt Baker (television presenter) carrying out an experiment on the contents of a pig's stomach with Writtle Student Francine Gilman who was one of only five recipients nationally of the National Farmers Union of England and Wales Centenary Award.
Writtle School of Design (WSD).
Writtle College has a design school (WSD), which was voted 4th in the country by the Guardian League Table in 2012.
WSD specialises in areas such as landscape and garden design, landscape architecture, interior design and architecture and contemporary art and design. The landscape based courses offered by WSD are accredited by the Landscape Institute. 
The school has three unique design studios that students use, providing them with their own space to express their ideas and designs.
Recently WSD designed a temporary radio structure at the College and transmitted a set of live art broadcasts.
Annually, WSD holds an end of year exhibition that celebrates the final pieces of third year undergraduate students. Students present their pieces of art to potential employers, family and friends. This event is open to the public and takes place in May.
Facilities.
The college has extensive facilities considering its relatively small size. It has an on-campus library, fully equipped science building and is based on a very large and beautifully landscaped 550 acre estate. These facilities include 2 indoor riding schools - one brand new, an equine Hydrotherapy unit and a therapy barn. The Animal unit – now named the Titchmarsh Centre for Animal Studies after the College Patron - includes various specifically designed areas such as the reptile house and the state of the art Dog Grooming room. The campus farm has recently received a new herd of cattle as well are planning for the arrival of sheep. Lordship Stud has many technologies that are essential to the equine Breeding industry including - 'Brenda' the semen collection dummy mare and a brand new ultrasound scanner with the employees qualified to make sure that students get access to watching the various tasks. Furthermore the college has a Mechanical horse which allows students the ability to perform vital rider position research and allows for the safe teaching and lecturing of students on various hands on tasks. The College also has SpermVision. This state of the art sperm analyser is used in research.
Social and living.
The college has an active Students' Union. The SU provides a varied social scene; major functions include the 'Freshers Ball' in September 'X-mas ball' in December and the 'Summer Ball' in June, the latter being particularly lavish, with a several marquees, fairground rides and semi formal meal. In 2011 the summer ball features DJ's Chase & Status and was reportedly so loud that some local residents complained about the noise levels. The 2012 ball was re-located to an alternative indoor venue on campus as a result. 
The Students' Union also organise the 'Writtle RAG' a long held tradition at the College, the students pick good causes to support, and then raise as much money as possible. This usually involves themed party nights, a BBQ and Moulsham 11 (a pub crawl along Moulsham Street in Chelmsford). The SU has a number of sports teams including; Rugby (men's and women's), football (men's and women's), clay pigeon shooting, hockey (men's, women's and mixed), netball, cricket and climbing. The College owns a number of full size pitches and a recently refurbished fitness centre. International students can attend social events to meet and greet other students. The international team at Writtle also organises tri[s to local sites, including London, making international students feel at ease. In 2013, the Writtle College Students' Union was named the Small and Specialist Students' Union of the Year at the NUS National Union of Students awards ceremony in Manchester. 
The "Baa and Chef", is the on-campus student venue, it is of a modern design, and includes a selection of big-screen televisions, games and an entertainment system which was generously donated to the College by entrepreneurial Writtle graduate Robert Forster in 2005.. The College has thirteen halls of residence: all are small compared to many other universities. All halls are mixed sex accommodation, non-smoking and have either network connections or wireless networks installed. All halls have basic cooking facilities and common rooms. Rooms can be single or double in size and can have a sink or en suite or neither. Catering at the college is provided by a number of small units and the main refectory "The Writz", named by college veteran Geoff Owen following its extension in the early 1990s, however, as of 2011, "The Writz" is now known as "The Garden Room".
The campus is located ten minutes from Hylands Park where the annual V Festival is held.
Awards.
Writtle College is a very active institution and its students have been recognised for the standard of their work. The Writtle Floristry team won the Gold award at the Royal Horticultural Society Hampton Court Palace Flower Show in 2012 for their exhibition entitled "Lady of Shallot" ). The floristry team also won a Silver award for their exhibition "Rock Around the Clock" in 2013 ().
The College's Further Education horticulture students won a Silver award at the Royal Horticultural Society Young Gardeners of the Year competition in 2013 and 2012. They also received the Bronze award in 2011. ().
International.
The College also has a number of international students from around the world – more than 10% of the student body and drawn from 50+ countries. Writtle’s primary international markets include Norway, South Korea and Japan. In recent times, international students have also contained those studying through the Marshal Papworth scholarship scheme. This has included students from Kenya and other developing countries.
Patron.
Titchmarsh is quoted as saying "Writtle has a wonderful reputation. It is one of the very best horticultural colleges in the UK and I hope I will be able to help promote the college in my capacity as patron."
Cinders Trophy.
The Cinders Trophy is a squash series played between Writtle and Writtle College. The teams are referred to simply as "Village" and "College". It is one of the most celebrated rivalries within Essex and dates back to 1974. It is currently played biennially, alternately in the village and college.

<doc id="18984730" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18984730" title="Russian neoclassical revival">
Russian neoclassical revival

Russian neoclassical revival was a trend in Russian culture, mostly pronounced in architecture, that briefly replaced eclecticism and Art Nouveau as the leading architectural style between the Revolution of 1905 and the outbreak of World War I, coexisting with the Silver Age of Russian Poetry. It is characterized by merger of new technologies (steel frame and reinforced concrete) with moderate application of classical order and the legacy of Russian empire style of the first quarter of 19th century. 
Revival school was most active in Saint Petersburg, less in Moscow and other cities. The style was a common choice for luxury country estates, upper-class apartment and office buildings; at the same time it was practically non-existent in church and government architecture. Neoclassical architects born in 1870s, who reached their peak activity in 1905-1914 (Ivan Fomin, Vladimir Shchuko, Ivan Zholtovsky), later became leading figures in stalinist architecture of 1930s and shaped Soviet architectural education system.
Origin of the style.
Background.
In early 20th century, Russian architecture (at least in Moscow) was dominated by "diverse and protean" "Style Moderne", a local adaptation of Art Nouveau. This style peaked in 1900-1904, and manifested itself in denial of classical order, flowing curvilinear shapes, floral ornaments and expensive artwork. High costs and exterior novelty limited this style to upper-class mansions, retail stores and middle-class apartment blocks. Many upper-class clients, especially in Saint Petersburg, rejected "Style Moderne" and insisted on traditional, neoclassical designs fitting their image of old gold. Art Nouveau never reached the "universal" status: the Church relied on Russian Revival tradition, while the charities and majority of homeowners used the economical "red brick" eclecticism. Muscovite Neo-Grec of 1870s-1880s was nearly forgotten, with a single exclusion of Roman Klein's Pushkin Museum (1898–1912). Meanwhile, numerous Empire style cathedrals, public buildings and private mansions of Alexandrine period that shaped central squares of Russian towns remained a nearly omnipresent, impressive statement of classicism, associated with the glorious age of Napoleonic wars and Russian poetry.
In 1902, two years before Bloody Sunday, when Saint Petersburg was preparing to celebrate its bicentennial anniversary. Alexander Benois, vocal anti-modernist activist of Mir Iskusstva group, defended the classical tradition of Saint Petersburg, rejecting both Art Nouveau and "official" Russian Revival, arguing that the classical city must return to its roots. In the same year, Evgeny Baumgarner specifically criticized Otto Wagner: "In leaning toward the utilitarian, he falls into an obvious absurdity. Proposing that the contemporary architect "come to terms" with the statement "nothing that is not practical can be beautiful", he lowers the architectural art, praised with such feeling, to the level of an applied craft... the theory of Professor Wagner proposes aesthetic suicide. The human soul requires architectonic beauty just as human vision requires good illumination.".
Development.
Practicing architects followed Benois; for example, in 1903 Ivan Fomin, a successful 30-year-old enthusiast of Art Nouveau, switched to purely Neoclassical, palladian architecture and returned from Moscow to Saint Petersburg to practice neoclassicism on its own territory; his studies of early 19th century, culminating in a 1911 exhibition of historical architecture, were followed by a wide public interest to classical art in general. The conceptual statement of neoclassicism - and the term itself - were further developed in 1909 in "Apollon" magazine by Benois and Sergei Makovsky. 
The new style took over specific niches, starting with nostalgic country estates and upper-class downtown apartment buildings. By 1914 it also became the preferred choice for schools and colleges. In Moscow, "all" new cinemas of the period were built in neoclassical stylem, continuing the old theatrical tradition. Neoclassicists celebrated victory: "Classical tendencies in architecture have replaced the sinuously agitated, 'temperamental', and riotously 'dashing' modernistic efforts of architects like Kekushev, as well as the simplified structures faced with brilliant walls of yellow brick of architects like Schechtel." This time, the concept shifted from preservationism to shaping a new, wholesome art, opposed to all diverse styles of 19th century. "There was a difference, but not a leap, and here lies the subtlety of understanding the problem of neoclassicism."
Denial of Art Nouveau.
A common concept of Soviet art critics linked neoclassical revival to the social shock of the 1905 revolution; this concept, narrowed to architecture and refined further by W. C. Brumfield, treats neoclassicism in 1905-1914 architecture as a professional reaction against Art Nouveau. The society, shaken up by Russian revolution of 1905 "dismissed Art Nouveau as ephemera of fashion" and settled for moderation in architecture. By the end of hostilities, moderate Neoclassicism emerged as an ethically acceptable alternative to extravagance of the past. Prior to 1905, Saint Petersburg architects completed 30 buildings in Neoclassical Revival (about 5% of extant neoclassical buildings). Five years, 1905–1910, added 140 new buildings. By 1910, Saint Petersburg reached an equilibrium between Neoclassical Revival and Art Nouveau (in terms of new buildings launched and completed). Ivan Fomin specifically praised the universal, easy-to-reproduce set of classical rules, consolidating the profession: "When the style was being formed, all the masters in the capital and the provinces worked toward the same end, not fearing to imitate one another. And in this is the guarantee of strength." 
By 1914, Revivalists clearly won but their victory was not universal. A large share of intellectuals despised Empire style as a symbol of slavery and militarization of Alexandrine period. Ilya Repin publicly condemned it as a lust for luxuries of "the filthy Arakcheyev period, and all the harshness of living suffered by millions, which are now free" ().
Alternative to eclecticism.
Contemporary domestic authors dismiss the concept outlined above as an oversimplification. Reaction against Art Nouveau did exist, but was only a secondary, tangential factor behind neoclassical revival. 1902 and 1909 statements by Benois targeted the ideology of eclecticism in general. Neoclassicism of early 20th century extended far beyond denial of a rival style, pretending to create a wholesome realm of art in all its forms. This viewpoint is indirectly supported by the fact that there was no clear-cut boundary between two styles. Art Nouveau artists, starting with Otto Wagner and Gustav Klimt, relied on Greek heritage. Neoclassical architects followed the same gesamtkunst approach to interior and exterior finishes and relied on the work of the same craftsmen and factories. Architects (Fyodor Schechtel) and painters (Mstislav Dobuzhinsky) created pure examples of both styles. Despite the magazine critique, various forms of Art Nouveau persisted until the Russian Revolution of 1917, which halted all construction altogether.
Neoclassical projects in Saint Peterburg emerged when Art Nouveau was still in its infancy, years before the 1902 magazine campaign. Russian Ethnographic Museum was laid down in 1900, Petrovskaya Embankment in 1901, the Public Library in 1896.
Importance of clients and their tastes, elevated in the traditional concept, is also disputed. Architects were not simple contractors: many were also wealthy property developers, betting their own money (Roman Klein, Nikita Lazarev, Ernst Nirnsee). They were part of a wider movement in arts, led by writers and painters who, unlike architects, were not bound by investors. The artists themselves changed the tastes of general public. 
Contemporaries clearly identified revival of empire style as a part of a larger trend seeking the way out of apparently unsolvable crisis of fin de siècle; Art Nouveau and decadence in general were perceived as the least of threats. As Nikolai Berdyaev stated in 1910, "Modern age joins the ranks of Goethe ... a clear reaction against mounting catastrophes - the catastrophe of Nietzsche and his Übermensch, the catastrophe of Marx and his socialist judgement day, and the catastrophe of falling into abyss of decadence."
Style defined.
Reposession of simplicity.
Depending on the function of the building, purity of the style varied from refined Palladian legacy in luxury mansions to superficial, shallow decorations of utilitarian apartment blocks. All these buildings share one feature: "Repossession of Simplicity. Geometry of basic shapes, clean surfaces... returned the integrity and monumentality that was lost in second half of 19th century" ("Обретение простоты... геометризация объемов, очищение плоскости возвращали архитектуре черты слитности, монументальности, утраченные во второй половине 19 века"). 
Pure revival of Empire style was limited to temporary exhibition projects and suburban and country mansions, where abundant land allowed low but wide symmetrical layouts. Rarely, as in the case of Vtorov's mansion, the same approach was reproduced in downtown residences or in public buildings (Museum of Ethnography in Saint Petersburg). Typical Saint Petersburg construction projects of that period already passed the 5-story mark, unheard of in early 19th century, and needed careful adaptation of neoclassical spirit to the new scale. Early attempts of mechanical, superfluous attacthment of columns and porticos to ordinary apartment blocks failed; by 1912 the problem was resolved, most notably by Vladimir Shchuko. His "Markov Apartments" suggested two ways of handling the scale: either use of giant order, with pilasters running the whole height of the building, or adaptation of earlier palladian motives; both relied on expensive natural stone finishes and modern structural engineering. The result "combined classical elements in a monumental design that is "neither historical nor modern". Shchuko developed a style appropriate for contemporary urban architecture, one that provided material evidence of the classical values."
Fragmentation of the movement.
The new trend, favored by investors, naturally attracted opportunistic practitioners of other styles; the move was simplified by the fact that all graduates of professional schools had formal classical training (more prominent in Imperial Academy of Arts and the Moscow School, lesser in Byzantine-oriented Institute of civil engineering). The growing Neoclassical community spun off separate revivalist groups with their own stylistic codes.
Baroque revival, the earliest of these schools, was popularized by Mir Iskusstva and flourished in Saint Petersburg, notably in the Peter the Great school building designed by Alexander Dmitriev in collaboration with Alexander Benois and Mir Iskusstva artists. This municipal project began in 1902, and the city specifically requested baroque style to commemorate its founder; final drafts were approved only in 1908. In the same year the city held an international exhibition, designed in Petrine baroque. Baroque trend in graphic arts was popularized by Lev Ilyin and Nikolay Lanceray.
Renaissance revival was practiced by Ivan Zholtovsky in Moscow and Marian Lyalevich, Marian Peretiatkovich and Vladimir Shchuko in Saint Petersburg. Their first statements of neo-Renaissance were completed in 1910-1912. Peretiatkovich died prematurely and did not leave a lasting following, while Zholtovsky created his own professional school that persisted from 1918 to his death in 1959. However, in 1905-1914 he completed only a few neo-Renaissance buildings; the bulk of his work of this period belong to pure neoclassicism. On the contrary, amount of neo-Renaissance projects in 1910s Saint Petersburg was large enough to become a lasting trend; works of Schuko and Lyalevich were instantly copied by lesser-known followers. Alexander Benois and Georgy Lukomsky, now disillusioned by superfluous copying of empire style motives, welcomed the "stern tastes of Italian architects."
"Modernized neoclassicism", not related to Russian heritage or its Palladian roots, was exemlified in the new building of Embassy of Germany in Saint Isaac's Square, designed by Peter Behrens in 1911 and completed by Mies van der Rohe in 1912. The red granite building combined heavy-set, simplified shape with 14 giant columns, and was unusually functional, well lit and ventilated inside. Contemporaries detested its style as "Teutonic architecture", but quarter of a century later it perfectly fitted in the concept of both stalinist and nazi architecture. A similar trend, although not as radical, was emerging among Moscow architects.
War, revolution and post-war development.
The last examples of neoclassical revival were laid down shortly before the outbreak of World War I. Independent developers in Moscow started a number of unconnected large housing projects; advent of the elevator allowed them to reach 9-story mark. These buildings, usually called "cloudbreakers" () usually appeared outside of the Garden Ring: the city restricted highrise construction in the historical center, including the ban on Ivan Mashkov's 13-story tower in Tverskaya Square that could become Moscow's first skyscraper. In Saint Petersburg, Ivan Fomin and Fyodor Lidwal started redevelopment of Goloday Island - a residential park spanning over one square kilometer, the largest single project of the period. It materialized only in part; Moscow projects were mostly complete during the war, while some remained unfinished into the 1920s.
After the Russian Revolution of 1917 the movement lost its leaders in literature (Ivan Bunin) and fine arts (Benois, Dobuzhinsky) to emigration. Some of the architects, especially those based in Saint Petersburg or having a foreign citizenship (Fyodor Lidwal, Noy Seligson) emigrated too; some disappeared in the fog of war like Ernst Nirnsee. However, the influential architects who shaped the neoclassical movement (Fomin, Ivan Kuznetsov, Mayat, Schuko, Rerberg, Zholtovsky) remained in Soviet Russia and quickly restored their role as leaders of the profession. Zholtovsky, who was at the helm of VKhuTEMAS architectural school in 1918-1922, temporarily emigrated to Italy after a revolt of modernist students ousted him from his chair; Zholtovsky returned in 1926, and was immediately awarded with a string of new projects - both Renaissance and constructivist. Other neoclassicists of his generation also had to modernize their art to some extent, and had successful practice in the second half of 1920s, producing high-profile buildings (Rerberg's Central Telegraph, Fomin's Dinamo Building in Moscow).
Most of urban neoclassical buildings of 1905-1914 survived the Soviet period quite well - they were, in fact, the most recently constructed pre-revolution buildings, and despite inadequate maintenance their initial quality was high enough to stand unaltered for nearly a century. Many have lost original interiors; in the decade following World War II some of Moscow apartment buildings were built up (adding two or three stories was a common and inexpensive solution to the housing shortage), but their external styling survived. Another wave of reconstruction that started in 1990s and continues to date, have caused numerous facadist rebuilds. Pure, unaltered examples of the style are nevertheless quite common. Nationalized country estates, on the contrary, did not fare just as well. Their new functions (ranging from almshouses to military headquarters) sooner or later called for alteration and expansion; new owners had no incentive to preserve the original buildings. Frequently they were abandoned and left to decay - especially after the World War II depopulated the countryside.

Ivan Ivanovich (Ива́н Иванович) (28 March 1554 – 19 November 1581) of the House of Rurik, was Tsarevich - the heir apparent - of the Tsardom of Russia, being the second son of Ivan the Terrible and Anastasia Romanovna, and elder brother of Feodor.
The young Ivan apparently accompanied his father during the Massacre of Novgorod at the age of 15. For five weeks, he and his father would watch the Oprichniks with enthusiasm, and retire to church for prayer.
Ivan purportedly once saved his father from an assassination attempt. A Livonian prisoner named Bykovski raised a sword against the elder Ivan, only to be rapidly stabbed by the Tsarevich.
In 1566, it was suggested that he marry Virginia Eriksdotter, daughter of King Eric XIV of Sweden, but this did not come about. At the age of 17, Ivan was betrothed to Eudoxia Saburova, one of 12 marriage finalists rejected by his father. Due to her sterility, Ivan's father banished her to a convent. He later married Praskovia Solova, only to have the elder Ivan send her away for the same reason.
At age 27, Ivan was at least as well read as his father, and in his free time, wrote a biography on Antony of Siya. His third wife was Yelena Sheremeteva, who was found to be pregnant on October 1581. His relationship with his father began to deteriorate during the later stages of the Livonian War. Angry with his father for his military failures, Ivan demanded to be given command of some troops to liberate besieged Pskov.
Their relationship further deteriorated when on 15 November, the Tsar, after seeing his pregnant daughter-in-law wearing unconventionally light clothing, physically assaulted her. Hearing her screams, the Tsarevich rushed to his wife's defense, angrily shouting, "You sent my first wife to a convent for no reason, you did the same with my second, and now you strike the third, causing the death of the son she holds in her womb". Yelena subsequently suffered a miscarriage. The Tsarevich confronted his father on the matter, only to have the topic changed to his insubordination regarding Pskov. The elder Ivan accused his son of inciting rebellion, which the younger Ivan denied, but vehemently stuck to the view that Pskov should be liberated. Angered, Ivan's father struck him on the head with his scepter. Boris Godunov, who was present at the scene, tried to intervene, but received blows himself. The younger Ivan fell, barely conscious and with a bleeding wound on his temple. The elder Ivan immediately threw himself at his son, kissing his face and trying to stop the bleeding, whilst repeatedly crying, "May I be damned! I've killed my son! I've killed my son!" The younger Ivan briefly regained consciousness and said "I die as a devoted son and most humble servant". For the next few days, the elder Ivan prayed incessantly for a miracle, but to no avail. The Tsarevich died on 19 November 1581.

Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series

Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series was a series of tours in support of Nine Inch Nails' debut album Pretty Hate Machine. The series took place over much of North America and Europe from 1989 to 1991. During this time, the band's line-up mainly consisted of Trent Reznor on vocals and guitars, Richard Patrick on back-up vocals and guitars, Chris Vrenna on drums, and a hired musician usually to play keyboards. The series consisted of eight tours, spanning Skinny Puppy's VIVIsectVI tour to a tour of Europe for the band.
VIVIsectVI Tour.
Serving as the opening band for industrial icons Skinny Puppy, they played mostly songs from the then-unreleased "Purest Feeling" sessions and the then-upcoming "Pretty Hate Machine" album. This was the band's first official tour.
Pretty Hate Machine promotional tour.
After the band's stint as the opening act for Skinny Puppy, Trent Reznor recruited Richard Patrick to play lead guitar for the band. Former keyboardist Chris Vrenna decided to play live drums for the band after Trent Reznor deemed electronic drum machines not suitable for the band's newer material. Gary Talpas, otherwise known as art director for NIN between 1989 and 1997, replaced Vrenna on keyboards. This short tour was the direct result of Pretty Hate Machine's release and underground following after its release through indie label TVT Records.
Automatic Tour.
Due to the band's success touring smaller clubs, pioneering noise pop band The Jesus & Mary Chain took notice of the band and asked them to be the opening act for their upcoming Automatic Tour. The band accepted, and began as the opening act for the tour. During this time, the band hired Nick Rushe to be the band's full-time keyboardist. It would be the band's first venture off of the eastern coast.
Setlist.
"Something I Can Never Have" & "The Only Time" was played in some shows.
Deep Tour.
Almost immediately after touring with The Jesus & Mary Chain, Peter Murphy, former frontman for Bauhaus, asked the band to be the opening act for his solo tour. The band accepted and went back on tour almost immediately. The band changed keyboardists as well, switching Nick Rushe for David Haymes.
Hate 1990.
After touring as opening acts for various bands and gaining enough of a fan base to embark on a headlining tour, the band went on tour in 1990 to various clubs and auditoriums across the North America, bringing along Dallas, Texas based band "Lesson Seven" as their opening act. This is the first of two North America tours. Lee Mars replaced David Haymes on keyboards for the tour. This began the band's notorious image of aggressive (and often dangerous) concerts in which band members would take out their anger on their instruments and through their music. Nine Inch Nails' fan base grew largely during this time.
Band lineup.
Trent Reznor - lead vocals/Backup Guitar <br>
Richard Patrick - Lead Guitar/Backup Vocals <br>
Chris Vrenna - drums <br>
Lee Mars - keyboards/Programming
Sin Tour.
During the winter of late 1990 and early 1991, the band embarked on the second leg of their tour, entitled the "Sin Tour". The band played more clubs than in the Hate Tour, but continued to headline venues across the country they had been playing in before. This was the band's first tour to take place in Mexico. Lee Mars continued as the keyboardist for the band.
Lollapalooza Tour.
After the moderate success of their Hate and Sin tours, Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction invited the band to join up on the first year of their country-wide Lollapalooza festival. The band accepted, and their popularity skyrocketed due to the band's considerate media exposure on MTV. The song "Now I'm Nothing" was written during this time as the opener to their sets, and often bled into their single "Terrible Lie". Portions of the performances can be found on the documentary Closure. Two songs from the upcoming Broken debuted during this time. On the opening date of the concert in Phoenix, the band's equipment continued to malfunction so they were forced to abandon their set after only playing two songs.
Pretty Hate Machine European Tour.
After their set at Lollapalooza gained them a large fan base, the band went to tour in Europe in a mixture of headlining and opening act concerts, including two shows as a support act for Guns N' Roses. The band played four shows in Germany due to the country's roots in industrial music. This was the band's first venture into Europe. The live band remained unchanged.
Setlist.
The band's setlist at these tours would include the following songs:
From Pretty Hate Machine:
From (yet unrecorded) Broken:

Institut supérieur du commerce de Paris

The Institut Supérieur du Commerce ("ISC Paris Business School") is a French university-level institution (grande école), a business school located in Paris, France. Its programmes consist of a core degree, a Master's degree in management according to the Bologna European higher education standards, and a MBA program offering sixteen different specializations. These courses are available both on a part-time and full-time basis. ISC Paris's degrees are accredited by the French Ministry of Education.
History.
The ISC Paris business school was inaugurated in the autumn of 1962 at 6 avenue Léon Heuzey, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Founded by Paul Icard, director of the Institute of Industrial Sale Psychology, with the goal of training "business executives adapted to the methods of modern business." The ISC Paris was a non-profit association (law 1901) with a Board of Directors. Students were eligible for admission immediately after the earning their baccalaureate; initially the duration of study was two years. The first promotion (promo 64) was composed of thirty-eight male students. Founded in early 1963, the Board of Students of the ISC Paris directed student life and activities at the school. Extracurricular activities were a core part of the professional degrees. In 1969, the Board of Students separated from the school administration and incorporated as a separate, non-profit association. In 1970 the "Junior Enterprise" of the ISC Paris was founded.
On May 19, 1969, ISC Paris was recognized by the State in a ministerial decree. Simultaneously, it moved to new premises at 13 rue Jacques Bingen in the 17th arrondissement. The school had a student body of approximately one hundred students at the time. In 1971 the length of the course of study was increased by a year to three years. Also in 1971, admission to the school was closed to those who had only earned their baccalaureate, requiring an additional year of preparation. The same year admission to the "Institut supérieur du commerce de Paris" was opened to women.
In 1975, ISC Paris moved to its current location at 22 Boulevard du Fort de Vaux, occupying an area of 2200 m2 offering amenities such as a language laboratory, group study rooms, conference rooms, and a computer lab. The entry examination was thereafter opened to parallel admissions to students with 2 to 4-year post-baccalaureate university degrees. In 1976 there were nearly one thousand applicants to the business school. ISC Paris subsequently chose to open examination centers in regional provinces with the support of local chambers of commerce and high schools.
On May 21, 1980, a decree of the Ministry of Education announced that the ISC Paris's degree was guaranteed by the State. In 1981 a Department for Continuing Professional Education was established, offering training solutions to businesses. This was followed by the creation of ISC Master Program for graduate students. The "Institut Superieur du Commerce" was rebranded as the ISC Group. In 1983, the entry examination in first year was opened to applicants with a 2 years degree, in order to increase the pool of applicants. In October 1983, ISC Paris inaugurated new premises close to the Boulevard du Fort de Vaux. The school grounds expanded, eventually covering over 3000 m2.
The number of applicants to the ISC Paris increased as a result of the actions of the School Promotion Committee organizing conferences in preparatory classes across France. In 1992, ISC Paris created a series of examinations with the ESLSCA with identical written tests, but different oral exams for each school. This system lasted until 1999, when the ISC Paris decided to join the Banque Commune d'épreuves (Examination test base for most Business Schools). Meanwhile in 1996, ministry-led reforms increased the duration of preparatory classes from one to two years. The number of candidates reached 1 178 in 1982, 2 281 in 1984 and 3 875 in 1992. In 2010, the number of applicants reached more than 2,900 applicants from HEC preparatory classes and about 2,700 via the parallel admission process in 2011.
In 2006, ISC Paris newly designed its brand and became the ISC Paris School of Management. In March 2007, the ISC Paris was authorized to award Master's degree as part of the LMD Europe-wide Bologna process to its students by the Helfer Committee and joined the Conference of Grandes Ecoles. In 2009, a third building was constructed, the ISC 3, solely to accommodate MBA students. The campus subsequently covered an area of 13,600 m².
On September 8, 2010, Claude Riahi, the institution's Chief Executive Officer, was replaced by Andrès Atenza. However Claude Riahi is still President of the Board of Directors.

First International Bank of Israel

The First International Bank of Israel (known in Hebrew as HaBeinleumi Bank) is the fifth largest bank in Israel. Its commercial base consists primarily of large corporate clients as well as ordinary citizens. 
History.
The bank was founded in 1972 through the merger of several smaller banks. 
Edmond Safra (through distant cousin Jacques Nasser) acquired control of FIBI in the 1980s: after Edmond Safra's death, the Safra Group sold off its business interests in Israel. As of 2010, FIBI's largest current shareholder is the FIBI Holding Company Ltd, whose largest shareholder is the Bino-Liberman Group; in addition, the Israel Discount Bank holds a significant block of shares. 
The bank opened branches in London in 1981, and in Zurich in 1984. In 2006 it acquired a 68% interest in Bank Otsar Ha-Hayal for NIS 702 million. It is notable for being the only major bank in Israel which did not participate in the bank stock scandal in Israel in the 1980s and as such was the only prominent bank in the country not nationalized as result of the crisis. 
For a long time, FIBI was unique among Israeli banks in offering complete paperwork in English even to ordinary customers: as a result, it was patronized by many English-speaking immigrants.
At the end of 2012 First International's core capital ratio was the highest among Israel's major banks – 9.65%.

The Magnificent Seven (neutron stars)

The Magnificent Seven is the informal name of a group of isolated young cooling neutron stars at a distance of 200 to 500 parsecs from Earth. These objects are also known under the names XDINS (X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Stars) and XTINS (X-ray Thermal Neutron Stars).
History.
The first to fit this classification was RX J1856.5-3754, which was discovered by Walter et al. in 1992, and confirmed as a neutron star in 1996. The term "Magnificent Seven" was initially applied to the sources RX J1856.5-3754, RBS1556, RBS1223, RX J0806.4-4132, RX J0720.4-3125, RX J0420.0-5022 and MS 0317.7-6647. However, it was soon shown that MS 0317.7-6647 is, in fact, not a neutron star. Then in 2001 a new object fitting this classification was discovered: 1RXS J214303.7+065419/RBS 1774. Since 2001, no new good candidates have appeared. All seven sources were discovered by the ROSAT satellite.
Characteristics.
All seven are recognized to be relatively close-by (less than a few hundred parsecs), middle-age (several hundred thousand years) isolated neutron stars emitting soft x-rays due to cooling. The cooling is confirmed by the black body shapes of their spectra. Typical temperatures are about 50–100 electronvolts (eV). At least six out of the seven show spin periods in the range of approximately 3 to 12 seconds.
The light curve shapes are quasisinusoidal and single-peaked. However, RX J1308.6+2127 displays a double-peaked light curve, and in RX J0420.0-5022 there is some evidence for a skewness in the pulse profile, with a slower rise and faster decline. Rather counter-intuitively, the spectrum of both RX J0720.4-3125 and RX J1308.6+2127 becomes harder at pulse minimum.
A coherent timing solution has been recently obtained for RX J0720.4-3125 and RX J1308.6+2127. The period derivatives are 7 10−14 s/s and 10−13 s/s, respectively. The derived dipolar field is 2–3 1013 G and the spin-down ages are 2 and 1.5 million years.
For a long time the Seven were considered to be steady sources, to the point that RX J0720.4-3125 was included among the calibration sources for the EPIC and RGS instruments on board the orbital X-ray telescope XMM-Newton. The continuous monitoring revealed however that the source underwent conspicuous changes in the period 2001-2003. In particular, while the total flux stayed more or less constant, the blackbody temperature steadily increased, going from ~86 to over 90 eV. This was accompanied by a change of the pulse profile, with an increase of the pulsed fraction. More recently this trend seems to have reversed. Starting from 2004, the temperature decreased, and there are hints that the overall evolution may be cyclic, with a period of ~10 years.
The Magnificent Seven represent a large class of young neutron stars with many properties different from normal radio pulsars. There are other types of young isolated neutrons stars which are different from standard radio pulsars, such as soft gamma repeaters, anomalous X-ray pulsars, rotating radio transients, and central compact objects in supernova remnants. Some of them can be related to the Magnificent Seven.
Some of the seven have very weak optical counterparts. For the brightest one (RX J1856-3754), the trigonometric parallax and proper motion are known. The distance to the sources is about 161 parsecs. Similar data is obtained for the second brightest object RX J0720.43125. The distance is ~330 parsecs. Projected velocities are ~280 kilometers per second (km/s) and ~115 km/s, respectively. These data allow astronomers to reconstruct the stars' trajectory and so identify the site of their birth. Distance estimates to other sources can be found in Posselt et al. (2007)
Population synthesis studies show that the Magnificent Seven are related to the Gould Belt, a local group of stars with an age of ~30–50 million years formed by massive stars. Reconstruction of trajectories of neutron stars confirmed this conclusion. In the solar vicinity, these neutron stars outnumber radio pulsars of the same age. This means that the Magnificent Seven-like objects may be one of the most typical young neutron stars with a galactic birth rate larger than that of normal radio pulsars.
XMM-Newton's observations made it possible to detect wide absorption features in spectra of several of the Magnificent Seven. Although their origin is not clear yet (see Haber (2006) for references and more detailed description of the results), it is almost certain that the star strong magnetic field plays a fundamental role in their formation. Absorption features may then provide a powerful diagnostics for the strength of the surface field. At present, two main explanations for their origin have been suggested: either proton cyclotron resonances or atomic transitions in light elements. Interestingly, for the two sources in which a spin-down measure is available, the values of B obtained from spin-down assuming magnetodipolar braking are in reasonable agreement with those inferred from the line energy. Once the nature of the lines has been settled and if an independent measurement of the magnetic field is available (e.g. through spin-down), a measure of the gravitational redshift will be possible, paving the way to the simultaneous determination of both the star mass and radius.
Physical characteristics.
Data for the table were partly taken from Kaplan (2008), partly from a yet-unpublished review by R. Turolla, and partly from other sources. Temperature estimates vary slightly in different publications. The source RX J0720.4-3125 is variable in temperature and pulsed fraction.
Research.
The seven objects seem to be the best laboratory to study neutron star atmospheres and, probably, internal structure. The holy grail of neutron star astrophysics is the determination of the equation of state (EOS) of matter at supra-nuclear densities. The most direct way of constraining the EOS is to measure simultaneously the neutron star mass and radius. If a neutron star emits blackbody radiation from its surface of radius formula_1 at homogeneous temperature formula_2, the received flux at distance formula_3 is:
So, if distance formula_3 is known and formula_2 can be determined by spectral analysis, the previous relation immediately yields the star radius. Reality is somewhat more complicated, but this oversimplified analysis catches the essence of what is needed in order to measure the neutron star radius: distance, flux and surface temperature. Observing the star thermal emission is therefore crucial. Among all thermally emitting neutrons stars the Magnificent Seven are the only ones with a purely blackbody spectrum. Their clean thermal emission, unmarred by contamination from magnetospheric activity, a surrounding nebula or supernova remnant, makes these sources ideal targets for such a study: the Magnificent Seven are the perfect neutron stars.
Despite many attempts, no radio emission is detected from these sources. The preliminary results from latest deep search with the GBT telescope are presented by Kondratiev et al. There are claims that some signal was detected at very low frequencies, but these results are not very certain and require confirmation.

Eastern world

The term Eastern world refers very broadly to the various cultures or social structures and philosophical systems of Asia or geographically the Eastern cultures. 
This includes the Far East (comprising Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Mainland China, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan in East Asia, plus Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam in Southeast Asia), West Asia (comprising Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen in Western Asia or the Middle East (aka the Near East), Central Asia (comprising Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), North Asia (aka Siberia), and South Asia (mainly the countries on the Indian subcontinent and below, comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, plus the British Indian Ocean Territory and the island countries of Sri Lanka and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean).
Due to the Mediterranean, or parts of it in both north and south, have formed in Classic times a single cultural and civilizational bloc, and due to the early expansion of the Islamic religion and the Arab language to all of its southern shores, North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Western Sahara, sometimes Mauritania and Sudan), the African part of the Greater Middle East, is often regarded as part of the Eastern world, while geographical Asian nations with a significant historical (pre-modern) or formative imprint of European populations and traditions such as the Philippines, or of those ultimately non-European in culture and origin whose indigenous populations were forced into Europe and its surrounding areas for a long period of time such as Israel, and in less mainstream views of what constitutes the Western world, Armenia, Azerbaijan, East Timor, Georgia, Hong Kong, Japan, Lebanon, Kazakhstan, Macau, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey may be considered as Western at least in part, including being both Western and Eastern, while Cyprus even became part of the European Union in 2004 under its internationally recognised government (the Greek Cypriot government in the south).
Identity Politics.
Asian concepts.
Many critics have pointed out that for generations now Europe and to a lesser extent the Western World have been trying to absorb Asian societies into their own society. This campaign makes it so that many societies when speaking about or thinking of these countries/regions in context of Asia and the eastern world they often withdraw and are reassigned with the Western world instead such as in the cases Turkey, Siberia (Russia), and other areas of Asia that are linked to the Western world. Asian countries that are still believed to a part of Asia such as the countries of East Timor, Hong Kong, Macau, the Philippines, Singapore, and to a lesser extent Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia are even then still less often thought of as such by the Western world and are marginalized in many Western concepts of the Eastern world this belief is so strong that even in Asia itself these places are also marginalized when it comes to Asia's ideas of the Eastern world.
Many Asian countries believe that European influence has been successful in absorbing their countries and regions of Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, North Asia (aka Siberia), and Turkey to the point that even within these societies themselves they rarely ever think of themselves as being a part of Asia, the Asian people, and the Eastern World.
Although the concept of a united Asian people and an Asian race is even more debatable due to the fact that most of the world link the identity of Asian only to the people of East and Southeast Asia and to a lesser extent the people of South Asia and so regions that who even though see themselves as part of the Eastern world such as the Arab nations of Western Asia, Israel, Iran, and the ethnic groups that come along with these countries don't identify as Asian. Another reason why a Pan-Asian identity is a flawed work in progress concept compared to the mass unity found in the continents of Europe and Africa is the fact that Asia is the most racially and ethnically diverse continent in the world that differs very widely among and within its regions with many different cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems whose people have an even further pan-continental belief of nationalistic, cultural, and ethnic individualism many of whom believe came out of the imperialistic colonization of the continent by foreign Western powers back in colonial times and because of this overt sense individualism across the continent once a specific group(s) is labeled something many groups within Asia will have a hard time identifying with the same label. Most of the people of Asia prefer to identify with their individual nations rather than with their continent, region, or each other and these attitudes can be found throughout the continent.
Other than Asia and some parts of Africa, Europe has successfully absorbed almost all of the societies of Oceania, the Americas and the Caribbean into the Western world, but not to the degree that they are considered a part of Europe as is the case with Asia.
The division between 'East' and 'West' is a product of European cultural history, and of the distinction between European Christendom and the cultures beyond it to the East. With the European colonization of the Americas the East/West distinction became global. The concept of an Eastern, "Indian" (Indies) or "Oriental" sphere was emphasized by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such distinctions were articulated by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and Indology. An intriguing fact to be noted is that Orientalism has been the only Western concept that was about a unified Eastern world and not about any specific region(s), but rather all of Asia together.
People from the Eastern world are known by certain regions in the West as "Oriental", while in others, it may still have a racial connotation (such as Brazil, where the more than 2 million Brazilians of East Asian descent are known as "brasileiros orientais" – in contrast to "asiáticos brasileiros", a term that includes all those with recent descent from anywhere in Asia, including the generally white Mizrahi Jews, Macanese, Turks and Arab Brazilians) that became outdated or even offensive in others.
European concepts.
During the Cold War, the term "Eastern world" was sometimes used as an extension of Eastern bloc, connoting the Soviet Union, China and their communist allies, while the term "Western world" often connoted the United States and its NATO allies such as the United Kingdom.
The concept is often another term for the Far East – a region that bears considerable cultural and religious commonality. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of Buddhism and Hindu Yoga is partly responsible for this.
Eastern culture.
Eastern culture has developed many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:

Education in Taoyuan County, Taiwan

Education in Taoyuan County, Republic of China, below tertiary level, is through an established school system that consists of elementary schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools. It is managed by the Education Department of the Taoyuan County Government. The director is Ming-Wen Chang. In the four-year period 2003–2007, 85 billion NT dollars were spent on education.
Profile of schools.
Below is a list of schools in Taoyuan County, listed by level of school.
Specific schools.
Ba-De Junior High School.
Ba-De Junior High School is a Junior High School in Bade City. It educates around 1,750 students in grades 7–9. Bade Junior High is 8 km away from Taoyuan City and 6 km to Yingge District, New Taipei City in the north, 8 km, from Chungli in the south, and 6 km to Dashi in the west. For transportation, there are buses operated by Taoyuan Bus and Yatung Bus running to the school.
In 1961, with the effort of Mr. Chiu Sheng, the Township Mayor, and other local personalities the Bade branch of Dashi Junior High School was granted the admittance to be built, and Mr Wang Huan-chi was appointed as the head.
In September 1963, it was allowed to be renamed as Taoyuan County Bade Middle School School, and Mr Wang Huan-chi, the head of the branch, was appointed as the first principal. In 1968, the government offered 9 years of free education, and the school was renamed as Taoyuan County Bade Junior High School.
The past principals were Mr. Wang Ting-hsun, Mr. Fanchian Wen-cheng, Mr. Li Shen-huo, Mr. Hsu Ching-fa, and Ms. Chen Kuai-yu.
Chu-Wei Junior High School.
This school is located in Dayuan, Taoyuan. The north borders Chuwei Fishing Port, and the south is near to the Taoyuan International Airport.
In 1969, due to the noises made by the airplanes, the idea of moving school was brought up. In 1983, the county magistrate, Mr. Hung,-chih, Hsu inaugurated the construction, which was completed in 1984.
Da-Luen Junior High School.
In 1961 Hsin Ming Junior High School, Da Luen, was first founded. In August 1963 DLJH was formally established. Mr. Kuo-Tung Cheng was appointed as the first principal.In September 1969, Mr. Han-Chiang Tang replaced Mr. Cheng as the second principal, through to Mr. Pang-Chiu Liu who was appointed as the seventh principal in August 2001
Da-Po Junior High School.
This school is located on Lin, Dapo Village, Hsinwu Shiang, Taoyuang County
The people here work mainly in agriculture, both farming and fishing, so the cultural standard here is considered to be not very high. Young people had to go a long way to Hsin-Wu, Fu-Kang and Yung-An for study before 1977, because there was not a school nearby. Then the local people bought a piece of land about 3.171 hectares through the helps from the local government of Taoyuan county and the township administration office of Hsin-Wu village to set up the branch of S.W.J.H.S, with only five classes, here by 1977, headed by Mr. Huang-Cheng-Hsiung as the first director.
Da-Si Junior High School.
This junior high school is located on Mingcheng East Road, Dashi township on a campus of 5.3 hectares.
The school was founded on 17 October 1946 named 'Dasi Junior High School'. The school was renamed 'Taoyuan County Dasi Junior High School' in 1968 when government executed the 9 year national standard education. The name changed to 'Wu Ling National Junior High School' in 1975. Finally, the school was renamed as 'Taoyuan County, Dasi Junior High School' in August 1992. The first location was on the east side of Dasi Town Chung Ching Park; the campus was around 1 hectare. In 1982, to allow the establishment of evening classes, they moved to the present campus in August 1985.
Dong-Sing Junior High School.
This school is located on Guangjhou Rd., Jhongli City, Taoyuan County.
Dong-Sing Junior High School was established in 1985. Due to the growth of the population in the community, the number of the classes has boosted rapidly from 10 to 113. There are currently 84 classes under the advice from the authority.
Hsin-Ming Junior High School.
Hsin-Ming Junior High was established in the summer of 1956, being named as Taoyuan County Yangmei High School Hsin-Ming Division. Principal Fang-chie Chang retained Mr. Shi-Tao Lee as the Division Supervisor. The temporary campus of Hsin-Ming was located in Hsin-Jie Temple, and the first graduates amounted to 880 persons and 16 classes. In 1958, Hsin-Ming bought the present campus from Provincial Law and Commerce College, and it has become the permanent home of Hsin-Ming since then. Hsin-Ming has undertaken several times of name-changing, and it’s illustrated as following.
As permitted, Hsin-Ming was independent in August 1959 as Taoyuan County Hsin-Ming Preliminary High School. The province authority assigned Hsin-Chao Hsieh as the first principal. Da-Luen and Nei-Li Divisions were set in 1961, and each of them was independent two years later. Due to “Nine-year Obligatory Education” announced in 1968, the school title was officially changed as Hsin-Ming Junior High School.
Principal Hsieh resigned in 1975. Director of Social Education Department in Education Bureau, Lin-Long Tsai was assigned as Acting Principal, and he became the principal in 1977. Principal Tsai transferred to Jian-Kuo Junior High School in February 1983. Jin-Chow Tsai took the position of principal and retired in February 1990.
The following principal was Wen-Bin Lee who established Class of Music Talents to foster students with gifts in music. Students amounted to 3500 persons (74 classes) during 1992 to 1994. Because of the re-demarcation of the school district and the establishment of Ping-Hsin Junior High School, Hsin-Ming was shrunk to 1500 persons (45 classes) by years. In 1999, Principal Lin was exchanged with the principal of Long-Gung Junior High School, Fang-Sun Lee.
Principal Lee, in his term during 2002, developed the Experimental Class of English Talents. However, due to the mutation of government policy, this project was abandoned right after the graduation of students. Hsin-Ming Baseball Team won the Championship of National Teen Baseball of Pony League and the third place of Teen Baseball of Asian Pony League. Principal Lee retired in August 2003, and Jin-Ming Dai took the position of Acting Principal until July 2004.
Education Bureau had assigned principal of Hsin-Po Junior High School, Yi-Bin Zheng to be the new principal of Hsin-Ming Junior High School since August 2004. Class for Talented Athletes was established in August 2004 to recruit excellent students who specialized in baseball. Class for Special Education was organized in August 2005. With the ground-breaking success, in 2005, Hsin-Ming Orchestra won the first place of Junior High Group in Taoyuan County, and it was on behalf of Taoyuan County to win the second place of the national competition. In the same year, Hsin-Ming Baseball Team won the Championship of National Baseball Game of Junior High School. This honor has never been earned by a team located more northern than Taichung County. In 2006, Hsin-Ming won the Championship of Taipei International Teenager Baseball Invitation Competition, the first place in qualification and the second place in the final of Taiwan-Japan International Teenager Invitation Competition.
With rich harvest of fifty-year school history of Hsin-Ming Junior High School, Hsin-Ming still needs to foster competitive and cosmopolitan citizens to accomplish the mission of education. From now on, Hsin-Ming is set up for excellent environment for study and inventive techniques of teaching to help students develop multiple abilities and make the success for all.

Data

Data ( or , also ) is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables; restated, data are individual pieces of information. Data in computing (or data processing) are represented in a structure that is often tabular (represented by rows and columns), a tree (a set of nodes with parent-children relationship), or a graph (a set of connected nodes). Data are typically the results of measurements and can be visualised using graphs or images. 
Data as an abstract concept can be viewed as the lowest level of abstraction, from which information and then knowledge are derived. 
"Raw data", i.e., unprocessed data, refers to a collection of numbers, characters and is a relative term; data processing commonly occurs by stages, and the "processed data" from one stage may be considered the "raw data" of the next. Field data refers to raw data that is collected in an uncontrolled in situ environment. Experimental data refers to data that is generated within the context of a scientific investigation by observation and recording.
The word "data" is the traditional plural form of the now-archaic "datum", neuter past participle of the Latin "dare", "to give", hence "something given". In discussions of problems in geometry, mathematics, engineering, and so on, the terms "givens" and "data" are used interchangeably. This usage is the origin of "data" as a concept in computer science or data processing: data are accepted numbers, words, images, etc. 
Data is also increasingly used in humanities (particularly in the growing digital humanities) the highly interpretive nature whereof might oppose the ethos of data as "given". Peter Checkland introduced the term "capta" (from the Latin "capere", “to take”) to distinguish between an immense number of possible data and a sub-set of them, to which attention is oriented. Johanna Drucker has argued that the humanities affirm knowledge production as “situated, partial, and constitutive” and that using "data" may therefore introduce assumptions that are counterproductive, for example that phenomena are discrete or observer-independent. The term "capta", which emphasizes the act of observation as constitutive, is offered as an alternative to "data" for visual representations in the humanities.
Usage in English.
"Datum" means "an item given". In cartography, geography, nuclear magnetic resonance and technical drawing it often refers to a reference datum wherefrom distances to all other data are measured. Any measurement or result is a "datum", though "data point" is now far more common.
In one sense, "datum" is a count noun with the plural "datums" (see usage in datum article) that can be used with cardinal numbers (e.g. "80 datums"); "data" (originally a Latin plural) is not used like a normal count noun with cardinal numbers and can be plural with such plural determiners as "these" and "many" or as a singular abstract mass noun with a verb in the singular form. 
Even when a very small quantity of data is referenced (one number, for example) the phrase "piece of data" is often used, as opposed to "datum". The debate over appropriate usage continues.
The IEEE Computer Society allows usage of "data" as either a mass noun or plural based on author preference. Some professional organizations and style guides require that authors treat "data" as a plural noun. For example, the Air Force Flight Test Center specifically states that the word "data" is always plural, never singular.
"Data" is most often used as a singular mass noun in educated everyday usage. Some major newspapers such as "The New York Times" use it either in the singular or plural. In the "New York Times" the phrases "the survey data are still being analyzed" and "the first year for which data is available" have appeared within one day. The "Wall Street Journal" explicitly allows this usage in its style guide.
The Associated Press style guide classifies "data" as a collective noun that is singular when a unit and plural when referring to individual items ("The data is sound.", and "The data have been carefully collected.").
In scientific writing "data" is often treated as a plural, as in "These data do not support the conclusions", and as a singular mass entity like "information", for instance in computing and related disciplines. British usage now widely accepts treating "data" as singular in standard English, including everyday newspaper usage at least in non-scientific use. UK scientific publishing still prefers treating it as a plural. Some UK university style guides recommend using "data" for both singular and plural use and some recommend treating it only as a singular in connection with computers.
Meaning of data, information and knowledge.
Data, information and knowledge frequently overlap, mainly differing in abstraction. Data is least abstract, information next least, and knowledge most. Data becomes information by interpretation; e.g., the height of Mt. Everest is generally considered as "data", a book on Mt. Everest geological characteristics may be considered as "information", and a report containing practical information on the best way to reach Mt. Everest's peak may be considered as "knowledge".
'Information' bears a diversity of meanings that ranges from everyday to technical. Generally speaking, the concept of information is closely related to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, instruction, knowledge, meaning, mental stimulus, pattern, perception, and representation.
Beynon-Davies uses the concept of a sign to distinguish between data and information; data are symbols while information occurs when the symbols are used to refer to something.
It is people and computers who collect data and impose patterns on it. These patterns are seen as information which can be used to enhance knowledge. These patterns can be interpreted as truth, and are authorized as aesthetic and ethical criteria. Events that leave behind perceivable physical or virtual remains can be traced back through data. Marks are no longer considered data once the link between the mark and observation is broken.
Mechanical computing devices are classified according to the means by which they represent data. An analog computer represents a datum as a voltage, distance, position, or other physical quantity. A digital computer represents a datum as a sequence of symbols drawn from a fixed alphabet. The most common digital computers use a binary alphabet, that is, an alphabet of two characters, typically denoted "0" and "1". More familiar representations, such as numbers or letters, are then constructed from the binary alphabet.
Some special forms of data are distinguished. A computer program is a collection of data, which can be interpreted as instructions. Most computer languages make a distinction between programs and the other data on which programs operate, but in some languages, notably Lisp and similar languages, programs are essentially indistinguishable from other data. It is also useful to distinguish metadata, that is, a description of other data. A similar yet earlier term for metadata is "ancillary data." The prototypical example of metadata is the library catalog, which is a description of the contents of books.

Union Steamship Company of British Columbia

The Union Steamship Company of British Columbia was a pioneer firm on coastal British Columbia. It started in November 1889 by John Darling, a director of the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, and nine local businessmen. It started with the local service on Burrard Inlet near Vancouver, and expanded to the entire British Columbia coast. Initially a cross harbour service with the steamers "Senator" and "Lonsdale", the line was asked to take on more roles, calling in at Howe Sound, Gibsons Landing, and various logging camps and sawmills. The demand outstripped the availability of vessels.
There was an initial capital base of £40,000 allowed for the purchase of three tugboats and seven barges, the foundation of the Union Company fleet. Between 1891 and 1911, the Company went on to build ten additional vessels, all but two from shipyards in Scotland and Ireland. In 1891 three Scottish made ships were assembled in Coal Harbour—the "Capilano", "Coquitlam", and "Cowichan"—and these hulls started the modern company. The fleet expanded over the years with C named steamers: the "Cassiar", "Chehalis", "Cardero", and "Cheslakee". Later the company built a Lady series, "Lady Alexandra", "Lady Celia" for example. The company was a lifeline for loggers, settlers and fish camps in a land without roads or cars. Boat day was a big event for many community as the steamer would bring in families, food and mail.
Between 1891 and 1911, the Company went on to build ten additional vessels, all but two from shipyards in Scotland and Ireland. During this period and beyond, the Company barely survived a number of misfortunes and ill-fated ventures, to eventually emerge as the principal steamship link to the growing resource industries of the central and north coast of the province.
While the period from 1911 to 1920 was for the Company a time of consolidation of its routes and services after a decade of expansion, marine trade was slowed by the outbreak of war in 1914. Economic recovery did not begin until the United States entered the war in 1917, giving a much-needed boost to the coastal lumber industry. But by the fall of 1922, the booming coastal salmon industry’s increasing need for dependable marine transport for its product had convinced the Union Company that an additional ship was required for the northern cannery run. Accordingly, the Scots firm of Napier and Miller at Old Kilpatrick on the River Clyde were engaged to build a large, modern vessel capable of meeting this burgeoning demand. 
The Union Steamship Company was bought out by the Canadian Pacific Steamships in 1948 in a marriage at the Senior Home.
The fire in Toronto forced the Federal Maritime Department to change marine regulations
regarding wooden passenger vessels, while the nature of the BC coastal fleet changed more to freight and a tug and barge operation. The Union Steamships ran until 1956 when a strike finished the fleet.
The assets of the Company were taken over by Northland Navigation in 1962.
The line had a good safety record in an age before satellites and radar. The "Chehalis" sank off Brockton Point in 1913 with a loss of life; the "Cheslakee" capsized on Texada Island; and the "Comox" collided with a ship in fog in Malaspina Strait. It should be remembered that this is over 50 years and a service of dozens of ships.

Vasant Tapu

Vasant Tapu Harji Chavda, usually known as Vasant Tapu (1936-1988) was a Tanzanian cricketer. A left-handed batsman and left-arm fast-medium/left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he played for the Tanzania national cricket team between 1967 and 1974 and also played first-class cricket for East Africa.
Biography.
Born in Tanganyika in 1936, Vasant Tapu began to play international cricket in August 1967 with two matches against India. The first was for Tanzania in Dar es Salaam and the second was a first-class match for East Africa in Kampala. In the first-class match, he scored 55 in the East Africa first innings and took 5/72 in the Indian first innings, his best batting and bowling performances in first-class cricket.
He played in the East African Quadrangular tournament in 1969 and 1970, and again in 1971, 1972 and 1974 when it had become a triangular tournament. He also went on a tour of England with East Africa in 1972. His last match for Tanzania was against Zambia in August 1974, and he had played his second and final first-class match earlier in the year, against the MCC in Nairobi. He died in 1988.

Information

Information, in its most restricted technical sense, is a sequence of symbols that can be interpreted as a message. Information can be recorded as signs, or transmitted as signals. Information is any kind of event that affects the state of a dynamic system that can interpret the information.
Conceptually, information is the message (utterance or expression) being conveyed. Therefore, in a general sense, information is ""Knowledge communicated or received concerning a particular fact or circumstance"", or rather, information is an answer to a question. Information cannot be predicted and resolves uncertainty. The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence and is inversely proportional to that. The more uncertain an event, the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event. The amount of information is measured in bits. Example: information in one "fair" coin ﬂip: log2(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits.
The concept that "information is the message" has different meanings in different contexts. Thus the concept of information becomes closely related to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, instruction, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, representation, and entropy.
Etymology.
The English word was apparently derived from the Latin stem ("information-") of the nominative ("informatio"): this noun is derived from the verb "informare" (to inform) in the sense of "to give form to the mind", "to discipline", "instruct", "teach": "Men so wise should go and inform their kings." (1330) "Inform" itself comes (via French "informer") from the Latin verb "informare", which means to give form, or to form an idea of. Furthermore, Latin itself already contained the word "informatio" meaning concept or idea, but the extent to which this may have influenced the development of the word "information" in English is not clear.
The ancient Greek word for "form" was μορφή ("morphe"; cf. morph) and also εἶδος ("eidos") "kind, idea, shape, set", the latter word was famously used in a technical philosophical sense by Plato (and later Aristotle) to denote the ideal identity or essence of something (see Theory of Forms). "Eidos" can also be associated with thought, proposition, or even concept.
Information theory approach.
From the stance of information theory, "information" is taken as a sequence of symbols from an alphabet, say an input alphabet χ, and an output alphabet ϒ. Information processing consists of an input-output function that maps any input sequence from χ into an output sequence from ϒ. The mapping may be probabilistic or determinate. It may have memory or be memoryless.
As sensory input.
Often information can be viewed as a type of input to an organism or system. Inputs are of two kinds; some inputs are important to the function of the organism (for example, food) or system (energy) by themselves. In his book "Sensory Ecology" Dusenbery called these causal inputs. Other inputs (information) are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of a causal input at a later time (and perhaps another place). Some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input. In practice, information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or system. For example, light is often a causal input to plants but provides information to animals. The colored light reflected from a flower is too weak to do much photosynthetic work but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee's nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower, where the bee often finds nectar or pollen, which are causal inputs, serving a nutritional function.
As representation and complexity.
The cognitive scientist and applied mathematician Ronaldo Vigo argues that information is a concept that involves at least two related entities in order to make quantitative sense. These are, any dimensionally defined category of objects S, and any of its subsets R. R, in essence, is a representation of S, or, in other words, conveys representational (and hence, conceptual) information about S. Vigo then defines the amount of information that R conveys about S as the rate of change in the complexity of S whenever the objects in R are removed from S. Under "Vigo information", pattern, invariance, complexity, representation, and information—five fundamental constructs of universal science—are unified under a novel mathematical framework. Among other things, the framework aims to overcome the limitations of Shannon-Weaver information when attempting to characterize and measure subjective information.
As an influence which leads to a transformation.
Information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns. In this sense, there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive, much less appreciate, the pattern. Consider, for example, DNA. The sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind.
Systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense, assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind, and patterns circulating (due to feedback) in the system can be called information. In other words, it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation, though not created or presented for that purpose. For example, Gregory Bateson defines "information" as a "difference that makes a difference".
If, however, the premise of "influence" implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it, the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge. Complex definitions of both "information" and "knowledge" make such semantic and logical analysis difficult, but the condition of "transformation" is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge, especially in the business discipline of knowledge management. In this practice, tools and processes are used to assist a knowledge worker in performing research and making decisions, including steps such as:
Stewart (2001) argues that the transformation of information into knowledge is a critical one, lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise.
The Danish Dictionary of Information Terms argues that information only provides an answer to a posed question. Whether the answer provides knowledge depends on the informed person. So a generalized definition of the concept should be: "Information" = An answer to a specific question".
When Marshall McLuhan speaks of media and their effects on human cultures, he refers to the structure of artifacts that in turn shape our behaviors and mindsets. Also, pheromones are often said to be "information" in this sense.
As a property in physics.
Information has a well-defined meaning in physics. In 2003 J. D. Bekenstein claimed that a growing trend in physics was to define the physical world as being made up of information itself (and thus information is defined in this way) (see Digital physics). Examples of this include the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, where particles can interact without reference to their separation or the speed of light. Information itself cannot travel faster than light even if the information is transmitted indirectly. This could lead to all attempts at physically observing a particle with an "entangled" relationship to another being slowed down, even though the particles are not connected in any other way other than by the information they carry.
Another link is demonstrated by the Maxwell's demon thought experiment. In this experiment, a direct relationship between information and another physical property, entropy, is demonstrated. A consequence is that it is impossible to destroy information without increasing the entropy of a system; in practical terms this often means generating heat. Another more philosophical outcome is that information could be thought of as interchangeable with energy. Thus, in the study of logic gates, the theoretical lower bound of thermal energy released by an "AND gate" is higher than for the "NOT gate" (because information is destroyed in an "AND gate" and simply converted in a "NOT gate"). Physical information is of particular importance in the theory of quantum computers.
Technologically mediated information.
It is estimated that the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1986 – which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB CD-ROM per person (539 MB per person) – to 295 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent of almost 61 CD-ROM per person in 2007.
The world’s combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007.
The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.
As records.
Records are specialized forms of information. Essentially, records are information produced consciously or as by-products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value. Primarily, their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value. Sound records management ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required.
The international standard on records management, ISO 15489, defines records as "information created, received, and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business". The International Committee on Archives (ICA) Committee on electronic records defined a record as, "a specific piece of recorded information generated, collected or received in the initiation, conduct or completion of an activity and that comprises sufficient content, context and structure to provide proof or evidence of that activity".
Records may be maintained to retain corporate memory of the organization or to meet legal, fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization. Willis (2005) expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered "...six key requirements for good corporate governance...transparency; accountability; due process; compliance; meeting statutory and common law requirements; and security of personal and corporate information."
Information and semiotics.
Beynon-Davies explains the multi-faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal-sign systems. Signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter-dependent levels, layers or branches of semiotics: pragmatics, semantics, syntax, and empirics. These four layers serve to connect the social world on the one hand with the physical or technical world on the other...
Pragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication. Pragmatics links the issue of signs with the context within which signs are used. The focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of living agents underlying communicative behaviour. In other words, pragmatics link language to action.
Semantics is concerned with the meaning of a message conveyed in a communicative act. Semantics considers the content of communication. Semantics is the study of the meaning of signs - the association between signs and behaviour. Semantics can be considered as the study of the link between symbols and their referents or concepts – particularly the way in which signs relate to human behavior.
Syntax is concerned with the formalism used to represent a message. Syntax as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems. Syntax is devoted to the study of the form rather than the content of signs and sign-systems.
Empirics is the study of the signals used to carry a message; the physical characteristics of the medium of communication. Empirics is devoted to the study of communication channels and their characteristics, e.g., sound, light, electronic transmission etc..
Nielsen (2008) discusses the relationship between semiotics and information in relation to dictionaries. The concept of lexicographic information costs is introduced and refers to the efforts users of dictionaries need to make in order to, first, find the data sought and, secondly, understand the data so that they can generate information.
Communication normally exists within the context of some social situation. The social situation sets the context for the intentions conveyed (pragmatics) and the form in which communication takes place. In a communicative situation intentions are expressed through messages which comprise collections of inter-related signs taken from a language which is mutually understood by the agents involved in the communication. Mutual understanding implies that agents involved understand the chosen language in terms of its agreed syntax (syntactics) and semantics. The sender codes the message in the language and sends the message as signals along some communication channel (empirics). The chosen communication channel will have inherent properties which determine outcomes such as the speed with which communication can take place and over what distance.

Karlamagnús saga

The Karlamagnús saga, Karlamagnussaga or Karlamagnus-saga ("saga of Charlemagne") was a late 13th century Norse prose compilation and adaptation, made for Haakon V of Norway, of the Old French "chansons de geste" of the Matter of France dealing with Charlemagne and his paladins. In some cases, the "Karlamagnús saga" remains the only source for otherwise-lost Old French epics.
The vast work is divided into 10 chapters, or "branches". Among its many tales, the work includes the following:
The saga was translated into Swedish verse in the fourteenth century as "Karl Magnus".

Richard Sanderson

Richard Sanderson (born 5 March 1953, Taplow) is an English singer, best known for his hit songs "Reality", "So Many Ways" and "She's a Lady".
Biography.
Born in England to a Scottish drum-playing father and a French accordionist mother, he was instilled with a love of music at a young age, and soon become a musician himself.
He started playing classical music on the piano at five years of age. At fifteen, he studied guitar and two years later became the organ player of a local rock band, Lover's Love. The band released four singles, one of them being "Youth Has Gone (Amour De Papier)", a song that he would revisit years later, "Find a Reason Why". Three years later he became the official pianist of Nancy Hollaway and David Christie. At twenty one he formed his own band and played in hotels all around the world. He then left for the United States and played with different bands while studying harmony and orchestration at the Berklee College of Music.
At twenty five, he returned to England and was hired at the famous Trident recording studio. Under Vogue Records he released his first solo single "Un Vent de Folie" under the name "Richard Lory". Then he released "No Stickers Please" in 1979, his first album. At Trident studio, he met famous film composer Vladimir Cosma and was selected to perform the main theme of the hit movie "La Boum" starring Sophie Marceau. He is the voice of the songs "Reality", "Murky Turkey", and "Go On Forever". The songs appeared on the film soundtrack album and as singles with other songs of the film.
The song "Reality" became a number one hit in fifteen countries, including France, Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland and sold eight million copies all around Europe and Asia. "Reality" is well known in Germany and it has been covered multiple times on DSDS, the German version of "American Idol".
In 1982 Polygram released his new studio album, "I'm in Love". The German version is different in two tracks from the French version ("Not Made for Me" and "Reality"). The single "She's a Lady" became number one in Italy and number four in Europe and Asia, selling more than 3 million copies. The album "Surprise" was released in 1984 with songs from "La Boum 2", sung by him instead of "Cook da Books" or "Freddie Meyer". "Surprise" is now a rare LP.
"Fairy Tale" was released in 1984 as the film score of "L'unique". The album would be released in CD format three years later. In 1987 he released the album "Reality", under "Carrere" label, and "Songs For Lovers" under the label "Blow Up".
At thirty five he began working on film scores and became the official composer of Daniel Costelle, director of many historical documentary films such as "La Victoire en Couleurs", which was nominated for an Emmy award in 1995 for best foreign film.
In 1990 he released his last pop music album, "Anytime at All". The song "When the Night Comes" became number one in Asia, and "So Many Ways" reached the Top Ten in RFA.
He composed for Barbara Hendricks, and produced a few albums of Jewish music. The beauty of these Shabbat songs inspired him to record some of them in English with modern orchestrations. His album "Legend: Visiting The Testament" was released in 1999.
In 2009 he made the album "Re-creátion" where he sings his favourite songs. In 2011 he released "Sings the Classics" ("Re-creátion" under "Sound and Vision" label).
Sanderson has two compilation albums: "The Best of Richard Sanderson", released in 1984 as a two CD album, and "Greatest Hits: The Very Best of Richard Sanderson" another two CD album where the first CD has digital remasterizations of his hits and the second CD has covers of his favourite songs.
He has scored four films: "Resonnances", "Acharnés", "Adam et Ève", "C'est facile et ça peut rapporter... 20 ans" and the TV miniseries "Unknown Images: The Vietnam War".
Richard Sanderson lives today near Paris with his wife and three daughters, Mélody, Ophélia and Angelina.

Sock

A sock is an item of clothing worn on the feet. The foot is among the heaviest producers of sweat in the body, as it is able to produce over of perspiration per day. Socks help to absorb this sweat and draw it to areas where air can evaporate the perspiration. In cold environments, socks decrease the risk of frostbite. The clothing's name is derived from the loose-fitting slipper, called a "soccus" in Latin, worn by Roman comic actors.
Etymology.
The modern English word "sock" is derived from the Old English word "socc", meaning "light slipper". This comes from the Latin "soccus", a term to describe a "light, low-heeled shoe", and deriving from the Ancient Greek word "sykchos".
History.
Socks have evolved over the centuries from the earliest models which were made from animal skins gathered up and tied around the ankles. In the 8th century BC, the Ancient Greeks wore socks from matted animal hair for warmth. The Romans also wrapped their feet with leather or woven fabrics. By the 5th century AD, socks called "puttees" were worn by holy people in Europe to symbolise purity. By 1000 AD, socks became a symbol of wealth among the nobility. From the 16th century onwards, an ornamental design on the ankle or side of a sock has been called a clock.
The invention of a knitting machine in 1589 meant that socks could be knitted six times faster than by hand. Nonetheless, knitting machines and hand knitters worked side by side until 1800.
The next revolution in sock production was the introduction of nylon in 1938. Until then socks were commonly made from silk, cotton and wool. Nylon was the start of blending two or more yarns in the production of socks, a process that still continues.
Fabrication.
Socks can be created from a wide variety of materials. Some of these materials are cotton, wool, nylon, acrylic, polyester, olefins, (such as polypropylene), or spandex. To get an increased level of softness other materials that might be used during the process can be silk, bamboo, linen, cashmere, or mohair. The color variety of sock choices can be any color that the designers intend to make the sock upon its creation. Sock 'coloring' can come in a wide range of colors. Sometimes art is also put onto socks to increase their appearance. Colored socks may be a key part of the uniforms for sports, allowing players teams to be distinguished when only their legs are clearly visible.
The township-level district of Datang in the city of Zhuji in Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China, has become known as Sock City. The town currently produce 8 billion pairs of socks each year, a third of the world's sock production, effectively creating two pairs of socks for every person on the planet on 2011.
Styles.
Socks are manufactured in a variety of lengths. Bare or ankle socks extend to the ankle or lower and are often worn casually or for athletic use. Bare socks are designed to create the look of "bare feet" when worn with shoes. Knee-high socks are sometimes associated with formal dress or as being part of a uniform, such as in sports (like football and baseball) or as part of a school's dress code or youth group uniform. Over-the-knee socks or socks that extend higher (thigh-high socks) are today considered female garments. They were widely worn by children, both boys and girls, during the late-19th and early-20th centuries., although the popularity varied widely from country to country.
A toe sock encases each toe individually the same way a finger is encased in a glove, while other socks have one compartment for the big toe and one for the rest, like a mitten; most notably Japanese tabi. Both of these allow one to wear flip-flops with the socks.
Leg warmers, which are not typically socks, may be replaced with socks in cold climate.
A business sock is a term for a colored sock for conservative appearance and casual foot wear. The term is often used loosely to indicate a term for a conservative office setting. For instance, business socks, business shirts and business shoes are used for office and job. These socks usually have patterns and are known to be a cause for bleach stains in laundry machines due to their colored manufacturing process and dyed attributes.
The Ancient Egyptian style of sock is a blend between modern Western socks and Japanese tabi, both of which it predates. Like tabi, Egyptian socks have one compartment for the big toe and another for the rest, permitting their use with sandals; like Western socks, they fit snugly to the foot and do not use fasteners like tabi.
Sizes.
In the United Kingdom, a sock's size is similar to the person's shoe size; for example, a foot that has a shoe size of 9 would require a sock sized 8-10.
In some other parts of the world socks are sized differently than shoes. In the U.S. numerical sock size is the length of the foot in inches, whereas shoe size is not.
Sock lengths vary, from ankle-high to thigh level.
Sports.
Most sports will require some sort of sock, usually a tube sock to protect one's legs from being scraped while participating in sport activities. In basketball, tube socks are worn, and in lacrosse, mid-calf socks are required. In football, knee socks are used. They are mostly to stop grass burns.
Other uses of the word.
The layer of leather or other material covering the insole of a shoe is also referred to as a sock. When only part of the insole is covered, leaving the forepart visible, this is known as a half-sock.
Footwraps.
Footwraps, pieces of cloth that are worn wrapped around the feet, were worn with boots before socks became widely available. They remained in use by armies in Eastern Europe up until the beginning of the 21st century.
Holiday items.
A sock is also used as a holiday item during Christmas. The sock, or christmas stocking, is usually hung by a nail and filled with small presents which Santa brings while the recipients are asleep.
Other uses of a sock.
In popular culture a (tube) sock is sometimes used by a male on his penis, without any other clothes, e.g. on the cover of The Abbey Road E.P., and in the film 21 & Over.
Missing socks.
Many people have commented on the mystery of why so many socks disappear in the laundry. Below is one such quote.

Lord Farquaad

Lord Farquaad is the main antagonist from the 2001 animated feature film "Shrek". He is voiced by John Lithgow. He doesn't appear in William Steig's picture book of the same name as the film.
Lord Farquaad in the "Shrek" films.
"Shrek".
Lord Farquaad is the comically short-in-stature, ruthless ruler of Duloc. Several times in the film it is commented that, in his capital city Duloc's towering height, Farquaad may be compensating for something. His birthday is April 15th.
In his pursuit of perfection, Farquaad attempts to rid his Kingdom of Fairy Tale creatures, offering a bounty for their capture and then exiling imprisoned creatures to Shrek's swamp. However, because Farquaad is not of royal stock, he cannot become a king until he marries a princess. He decides that Princess Fiona will be the perfect wife and queen, but she first must be rescued from her tower which is guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.
Unwilling to perform the rescue himself, Farquaad holds a tournament to discover the knight who will rescue Princess Fiona. Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc during the journey and become involved. They defeat the knights, so Farquaad decides to send Shrek on the quest. Farquaad agrees to move the Fairy Tale creatures out of Shrek's swamp if he rescues Fiona. Shrek delivers Fiona to Farquaad and Farquaad immediately proposes marriage, unaware that she becomes an ogress at sunset. Shrek disrupts the marriage ceremony, delaying a kiss between Farquaad and Fiona until after sunset. Fiona makes the transition from human to ogress form, upon which Farquaad rejects his new bride, banishing her back to the tower and claiming the title of King. He also sentences Shrek to death at that time. Before Farquaad finishes his claim of becoming the new King, the dragon who had guarded Fiona, and who developed a crush on Donkey while Fiona was being rescued from her castle, crashes through the window in response to a beckoning whistle from Shrek. She eats Farquaad. Moments later the dragon burps and Farquaad's crown comes out. Farquaad was apparently not well-liked in Duloc; when he is eaten, the citizens laugh and cheer.
It is presumed that he is dead when he enters as a ghost in the Shrek 4-D ride at Universal Studios and the 30 min Shrek Special on Nick in which he attempts to murder Shrek and Donkey, and kidnap and kill Fiona so that she can be his ghost queen. Princess Fiona is again rescued when Lord Farquaad is presumably destroyed by the Dragon again.
"Shrek the Third".
Lord Farquaad makes a cameo appearance in "Shrek the Third" during Gingy the Gingerbread Man's flashbacks, in which Farquaad yanks off Gingy's legs and mocks Gingy with them. This is a reference to the first "Shrek" film.
"Shrek Forever After".
He was originally intended to appear in the alternate universe (in which he would still be alive due to Dragon still being evil and not eating him), but the decision was apparently dropped.
Lord Farquaad also makes a cameo during the ending credits of Shrek Forever After.
"Scared Shrekless".
Despite being eaten by Dragon in the first film, Lord Farquaad plays a fairly major role in the made-for-TV Halloween special, "Scared Shrekless". Shrek challenges his friends to spend Halloween night in Farquaad's haunted castle, Duloc. The three little pigs note that Duloc was where Farquaad lived and died. Later on, Shrek also mentions how Donkey played a role in the death of Farquaad.
In other media.
Outside of the film series, Farquaad appears in the Universal Studios Theme Parks ride "Shrek 4-D" and its comic book adaptation by Dark Horse Comics. In the series, Farquaad returns as a ghost, with plans to make Fiona his Queen of the Underworld so that he will be King of the Underworld. However, he is once again defeated, only to reappear in the second issue; this time, he orders a man named Ferret and his hitman Thelonius to kill Shrek, who at the moment is investigating a foul-smelling gingerbread house. Farquaad's appearance here is comparatively minor. He does not appear in the third and final issue, save for a brief mention. Farquaad again appeared as an evil spirit in the Game Boy Advance game "Shrek: Reekin' Havoc", in which he made evil copies of fairy tale characters such as Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf, Peter Pan, and a giant from the world of Jack and the Beanstalk. After these bosses are defeated, he kidnaps Shrek before the final face-off. He also makes a cameo in "Shrek Smash and Crash" as a ghost. He also appears in the iPhone game "Shrek Kart" as a playable character called "Ghost of Lord Farquaad".
In theatre.
In the original Broadway production of Shrek the Musical, the role was played by Tony Award nominee Christopher Sieber. Since Sieber is approximately 6'2", he played the role on his knees, to give the illusion that he is really 4'2". He did, however, walk and stand for the curtain call. He earned his second Tony nomination for this part.
Though the film and musical are similar in many ways, Farquaad in the musical is more flamboyant and fun-loving, less subtle, and even more conceited.
Instead of holding a tournament, a raffle drawing is held to pick the knight to rescue Fiona with an extravagant song and dance number starring Farquaad and the Duloc Dancers called "What's Up Duloc". In one Broadway parody moment in the show, he ascends a tower at the end and imitates the end of Defying Gravity from the musical "Wicked".
In the second act he is seen playing a lampoon of Space Invaders on the Magic Mirror while taking a bubble bath. His past (which was never brought up in the movie) and the reason for his hatred for "that fairy tale trash" is elaborated on in his other song, "The Ballad of Farquaad". It turns out his father was one of Snow White's dwarfs, and his mother was the princess from "The Princess and the Pea", who left her crown behind so she could marry him. Unfortunately, she was so sensitive that she had to sleep on 25 mattresses and "one night she rolled over...and Momma was gone".
Farquaad claims that his father abandoned him in the woods as a child (similar to Shrek and Fiona's tales of being sent away by their own parents as children in the musical); however, when the fairy tale creatures crash his wedding to protest their banishment and bring along his father, it is revealed that he was kicked out because "you were 28 and living in my basement". After his humiliation, Fiona is transformed and the show continues in the same way as the movie with Farquaad proclaiming himself king and then the Dragon smashing throw the window and kills him with her fire breath instead of devouring him.
Sieber played the role for the duration of the Broadway run. The show then embarked on a First National Tour, in which Todd Buonopane was cast as Farquaad. However, he was replaced by David F.M. Vaughn in previews, the night before the tour opened. Nigel Harman played the role in London's West End beginning in May 2011.
The inspiration debate.
There is some speculation that Lord Farquaad's appearance may be inspired by Michael Eisner, the then-CEO of The Walt Disney Company, owing to producer Jeffrey Katzenberg's animosity toward his former employer. Others have noted a resemblance to Richard III of England. The name Farquaad is thought to be a way to get away with saying "fuckwad" in a children's film. Farquaad happens to be similar to the surname of film animator Mark Farquhar.
Reception.
IGN's Orlando Parfitt chose Lord Farquaad as his 14th favourite fantasy villain.

Bombay Dockyard

Bombay Dockyard—also known as Naval Dockyard—is an Indian shipbuilding yard at Mumbai. 
Shipbuilding was an established profession throughout the Indian coastline prior to the advent of the Europeans and it contributed significantly to maritime exploration throughout Indian maritime history. Indian rulers weakened with the advent of the European powers during the middle ages. Indian shipbuilders, however, continued to build ships capable of carrying 800 to 1000 tons. The shipbuilders built ships like HMS "Hindostan" and HMS "Ceylon", inducted into the Royal Navy. Other historical ships made by the Indian shipbuilders included HMS "Asia" (commanded by Edward Codrington during the Battle of Navarino in 1827), HMS "Cornwallis" (on board which the Treaty of Nanking was signed in 1842), and HMS "Minden" (on which Francis Scott Key wrote the poem "The Defence of Fort McHenry", later to become the lyrics to "The Star-Spangled Banner").

Ann Hood

Ann Hood (born 1956) is an American novelist and short story writer; she has also written nonfiction. The author of fifteen books, her essays and short stories have appeared in many journals, magazines, and anthologies, including "The Paris Review, Ploughshares,", and "Tin House." Hood is a regular contributor to The New York Times' Op-Ed page, Home Economics column.
She is a faculty member in the MFA in Creative Writing program at The New School in New York City. Hood was born in West Warwick, Rhode Island, and now lives in Providence with her husband and their children.
Biography.
Early Years.
After Hood earned her BA in English from the University of Rhode Island, she worked for the now-defunct airlines TWA as a flight attendant, living in Boston and Saint Louis and later moving to New York City. She attended graduate school at New York University, studying American Literature.
Hood began writing her first novel" Somewhere Off The Coast Of Maine" in 1983 while working as a flight attendant — and while attending graduate school —writing whenever she could during train rides to JFK airport or in the galleys of the airplane while passengers slept. During a furlough from the airline, she worked at the Spring Street Bookstore in Soho and Tony Roma's while writing "Somewhere Off The Coast Of Maine". Like much of her work, "Somewhere Off The Coast Of Maine" draws upon her own life. Hood says the book began as a series of short stories about three women who went to college together in the 1960s. A year earlier, her older brother, Skip, died in a freak accident and Hood was struggling with how to cope with the loss. At a writer’s conference, Hood was convinced by the writer Nicholas Delbanco that she was really writing a novel, and from there she began to connect the stories.
In 1987 the novel was published by Bantam Books as one of the launch books for their original paperback series, Bantam New Fiction.
Hood’s flight attendant career ended in 1986 when TWA went on strike and the flight attendants found themselves soon “replaced.” With more time to devote to writing, her stories and essays began to appear in "Mademoiselle", "Redbook", "Story", "Self", "Glamour", "New Woman", among others.
Personal life.
Hood lives with her husband, businessman Lorne Adrain, her teenage son Sam and her daughter Annabelle in Providence, Rhode Island.
On April 18, 2002, Hood's five-year-old daughter, Grace, died from a virulent form of strep. For two years Hood found herself unable to write or even read. She took solace in learning to knit and in knitting groups. She gradually made her way back to her craft, writing short essays about Grace and grief. To make sense of her own grief, in fall of 2004 Hood began to write her novel "The Knitting Circle", about a woman whose five-year-old daughter dies from meningitis. The woman joins a knitting group of others also struggling to heal from loss. Hood’s best-selling memoir" Comfort: A Journey Through Grief" chronicles her own struggle after her daughter’s sudden death.
The summer after Grace died, Hood and Adrain thought about having a baby. When Hood had trouble conceiving, they decided to adopt. In March 2005, they traveled to China, where they adopted Annabelle. Hood’s experience adopting in China became the inspiration for her 2010 novel "The Red Thread", which follows a woman struggling with the accidental death of her young daughter. The woman, Maya Lange, begins an adoption agency for Chinese babies.
Work.
Short Stories.
Hood’s short story "Total Cave Darkness," about an alcoholic woman who runs away with a Protestant minister nine years younger than she is, appeared in "The Paris Review" in 2000. It is also the opening story in her collection of stories "An Ornithologist's Guide To Life." The title story appeared in "Glimmer Train" in 2004 about a young girl who slowly discovers her mother is having an affair with their neighbor. Her stories have also appeared in "Tin House", "Ploughshares", "Good Housekeeping", "Story", "Five Points", and others.
Novels.
Hood is the best-selling author of ten novels, most recently "The Obituary Writer", in which she explores the theme of grief and "the remedies that can ease, if never entirely banish" it, and in which she explores gender roles and complications of romantic love. Her previous novel, "The Knitting Circle", also explored the theme of grief.
Non-fiction.
Hood’s best-selling memoir "Comfort: A Journey Through Grief "(W. W. Norton & Company, 2008), chronicling the death of her five-year-old daughter Grace and her subsequent search for healing, was named one of the top ten non-fiction books of 2008 by Entertainment Weekly and was a New York Times Editor's Choice.
"Do Not Go Gentle: My Search For Miracles in a Cynical Time" (Picador, 1999) follows Hood’s travels to Chimayo, New Mexico in search of a miracle cure for her father’s lung cancer. The dirt at El Santuario de Chimayo, a Roman Catholic church, is believed to have healing properties and thousands flock to the site each year. Her father’s tumor did disappear, but he later died from complications from chemotherapy. Hood initially wrote about this experience in an essay for Doubletake magazine. That essay went on to win a Pushcart Prize. Hood’s editor at Picador urged her to turn it into a book.
She is the editor of the anthology "Knitting Yarns: Writers on Knitting "(W. W. Norton & Company", "2013), in" "which her essay "Ten Things I Learned From Knitting" appears.
Teaching.
Hood is a faculty member in the MFA in Creative Writing program at The New School in New York City. She also teaches at New York University. Hood has also taught at the Eckerd College Writers’ Conference, The Maui Writers’ Conference, The Bread Load Writers’ Conference, among others.
Awards.
She is the recipient of the Paul Bowles Prize for Short Fiction, two Pushcart Prizes, and a Best American Spiritual Writing Award.

History of art

The history of art is the history of any activity or product made by humans in a visual form for aesthetical or communicative purposes, expressing ideas, emotions or, in general, a worldview. Over time visual art has been classified in diverse ways, from the medieval distinction between liberal arts and mechanical arts, to the modern distinction between fine arts and applied arts, or to the many contemporary definitions, which define art as a manifestation of human creativity. The subsequent expansion of the list of "principal arts" in the 20th century reached to nine: architecture, dance, sculpture, music, painting, poetry (described broadly as a form of literature with aesthetic purpose or function, which also includes the distinct genres of theatre and narrative), film, photography and comics. At the conceptual overlap of terms between plastic arts and visual arts were added design and graphic arts. In addition to the old forms of artistic expression such as fashion and gastronomy, new modes of expression are being considered as "arts" such as video, computer art, performance, advertising, animation, television and videogames.
The history of art is a multidisciplinary science, seeking an objective examination of art throughout time, classifying cultures, establishing periodizations and observing the distinctive and influential characteristics of art. The study of the history of art was initially developed in the Renaissance, with its limited scope being the artistic production of western civilization. However, as time has passed, it has imposed a broader view of artistic history, seeking a comprehensive overview of all the civilizations and analysis of their artistic production in terms of their own cultural values (cultural relativism), and not just western art history.
Today, art enjoys a wide network of study, dissemination and preservation of all the artistic legacy of mankind throughout history. The 20th century has seen the proliferation of institutions, foundations, art museums and galleries, in both the public and private sectors, dedicated to the analysis and cataloging of works of art as well as exhibitions aimed at a mainstream audience. The rise of media has been crucial in improving the study and dissemination of art. International events and exhibitions like the Whitney Biennial and biennales of Venice and São Paulo or the Documenta of Kassel have helped the development of new styles and trends. Prizes such as the Turner of the Tate Gallery, the Wolf Prize in Arts, the Pritzker Prize of architecture, the Pulitzer of photography and the Oscar of cinema also promote the best creative work on an international level. Institutions like UNESCO, with the establishment of the World Heritage Site lists, also help the conservation of the major monuments of the planet.
Prehistory.
The first tangible artifacts of human art are found from the Stone Age (Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic), periods when the first demonstrations that can be considered art by humans, appear. During the Paleolithic (25 000-8000 BCE), man practiced hunting and lived in caves, where cave painting was developed. After a transitional period (Mesolithic, 8000-6000 BCE), in the Neolithic period (6000-3000 BCE), when man became sedentary and engaged in agriculture, with societies becoming increasingly complex and religion gaining importance, the production of handicrafts commenced. Finally, in the Bronze Age (c. 3000-1000 BCE), the first protohistoric civilizations arise.
Paleolithic.
The Paleolithic had its first artistic manifestation on 25,000 BCE, reaching its peak in the Magdalenian period (±15,000-8000 BCE). The first traces of man-made objects appear in southern Africa, the Western Mediterranean, Central and Eastern Europe (Adriatic Sea), Siberia (Baikal Lake), India and Australia. These first traces are generally worked stone (flint, obsidian), wood or bone tools. To paint in red, iron oxide was used, in black, manganese oxide and in ochre, clay. Surviving art from this period is small carvings in stone or bone and cave painting, this especially from in the Franco-Cantabrian region; there are pictures with magical-religious character and also pictures with a naturalistic sense, which depict animals, notably the caves of Altamira, Trois Frères, Chauvet and Lascaux. Sculpture is represented by the so-called "Venus figurines", feminine figures which were probably used in fertility cults, such as the "Venus of Willendorf". Other representative works of this period are the "Man from Brno" and the "Venus of Brassempouy".
Neolithic.
This period—from c. 8000 BCE in the Near East—was a profound change for the ancient man, who became sedentary and engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, new forms of social coexistence and religion developed. 
The rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin—dated between Mesolithic and Neolithic—contained small, schematic human and figures, with notable examples in El Cogul, Valltorta, Alpera and Minateda. 
This kind of painting was also similar in northern Africa (Atlas, Sahara) and in the area of modern Zimbabwe. 
Neolithic painting was schematic, reduced to basic strokes (man in the form of a cross and woman in a triangular shape). There are equally noteworthy cave paintings in Pinturas River in Argentina, especially the Cueva de las Manos. 
In portable art, the Cardium Pottery was produced, decorated with imprints of seashells. 
New materials were produced like amber, crystal of rock, quartz, jasper, etc. In this period there appear the first traces of urbanistic planimetry, noting the remains in Tell as-Sultan (Jericho), Jarmo (Iraq) and Çatalhöyük (Anatolia).
Metal Age.
The last prehistoric phase is the Metal Age, as the use of elements such as copper, bronze and iron proved to be a great material transformation for these ancient societies. In the Chalcolithic (also called Copper Age) the Megalith emerged, monuments of stone, i.e. the dolmen and menhir or the English cromlech, as in the magnificent complex of Stonehenge. In Spain the Los Millares culture was formed, characterized by the Beaker culture and pictured human figures with big eyes. In Malta, noteworthy are the temple complexes of Mnajdra, Tarxien and Ggantija. In the Balearic Islands notable megalithic cultures developed, with different types of monuments: the "naveta", a tomb shaped like a truncated pyramide, with an elongated burial chamber; the "taula", two large stones, one put vertically and the other horizontally above each other; and the "talaiot", a tower with a covered chamber and a false dome.
In the Iron Age the cultures of Hallstatt (Austria) and La Tene (Switzerland) mark the significant phases in Europe. The first was developed between the 7th and 5th century BCE by the necropoleis with tumular tombs and a wooden burial chamber in the form of a house, often accompanied by a four-wheel cart. The pottery was polychromic, with geometric decorations and applications of metallic ornaments. La Tene was developed between the 5th and 4th century BCE, and is more popularly known as early Celtic art. It produced many iron objects such as swords and spears, which have not survived well, but bronze continued to be used for highly decorated shields, fibulas, and other objects, with different stages of evolution of the style (La Tene I, II and III). Decoration was influenced by Greek, Etruscan and Scythian art. In most of the continent conquest by the Roman Empire brought the style to an end. 
Ancient art.
Art, in the first period of history, began with the invention of writing, founded by the great civilizations of Near East: Egypt and Mesopotamia. This period also differed from others because artistic manifestations occurred in every culture of all the continents. In this period appear the first great cities in the main big rivers: Nile, Tigris and Euphrates, Indus and Yellow River.
One of the great advances of this period was writing, generated primarily by the need to keep records of economical and commercial nature. The first writing code was the cuneiform script, which emerged in Mesopotamia c. 3500 BCE, written on clay tablets. It was based on pictographic and ideographic elements, while later Sumerians developed syllables for writing, reflecting the phonology and syntax of the Sumerian language. In Egypt hieroglyphic writing was developed, with the first sample being the Narmer Palette (3100 BCE). The Hebrew language was one the first languages to utilize the method of writing with an alphabet ("Abjad", c. 1800 BCE), which relates a unique symbol for each phoneme; the Greek and the Latin alphabet derive from it.
Mesopotamia.
Mesopotamian art was developed in the area between Tigris and Euphrates (modern day Syria and Iraq), where from the 4th millennium BCE many different cultures existed such as Sumer, Akkad, Amorite, Chaldea, etc. Mesopotamian architecture was characterized by the use of brick, lintel and the introduction of construction elements like arc and vault. Notable are the ziggurats, large temples with the form of a terraced step pyramid, from which we have practically no traces left except their bases. The tomb was usually a corridor, with a covered chamber and a false dome, as in some examples found in Ur. There were also palaces walled with a terrace in the form of a ziggurat, giving great importance to gardens (the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World).
Sculpture was developed through wood carving and relief and was used in religious, military and hunting scenes, depicting both human and animal figures, whether they were real or mythological. In the Sumerian period there were small statues of angular form, with colored stone, bald head and with hands on the chest. In the Akkadian period there were figures with long hair and beard, noting the stele of Naram-Sin. In the Amorite period (or Neosumerian) notable is the representation of king Gudea of Lagash, with his mantle and a turban on his head and his hands on the chest. During Babylonian rule famous is the stele of Hammurabi. Assyrian sculpture is notable for its anthropomorphism of cattle and the winged genie, which is seen flying in many reliefs depicting war and hunting scenes, as in the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III.
With the advent of writing, arose literature as a means of expressing human creativity. The Sumerian literature is represented by the "Epic of Gilgamesh", written in the 17th century BCE. In it were written thirty myths about the most important Sumerian and Akkadian deities, which are: Innanas descent to hell and the cycle of gods Enki and Tammuz. Another example of relevance is the poem "Lugal ud melambi Nirpal" ("The hardship of Ninurta"), whose content type is moral and didactic. During Akkadian period notable is "Atrahasis", which includes the flood myth. In Babylonian literature notable is the poem "Enûma Eliš", which describes the creation of the world.
The music was developed in this region between 4th and 3rd millennium BCE, used in Sumerian temples, where priests sang hymns and psalms ("ersemma") to the gods. The liturgic chant was composed of "responsories"—song alternated between the priests and choir—and "antiphons"—song alternated between two choirs. They had several instruments like "tigi" (flute), "balag" (drum), "lilis" (predecessor of timpani), "algar" (lyre), "zagsal" (harp) and "adapa" (pandeiro).
Egypt.
In Egypt arose one of the first great civilizations, with elaborate and complex works of art, which assume the professional specialization of the artist/craftsman. Its art was intensely religious and symbolic, with a highly centralized power structure and hierarchy, giving great importance to the religious concept of immortality, especially of the pharaoh, for whom were built great monuments. The Egyptian art spans from 3,000 BCE until the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great. However its influence persisted in the Coptic art and Byzantine art.
The architecture is characterized by its monumentality, achieved by the use of stones in large blocks, lintel and solid columns. Notable are the funerary monuments, with three main types: mastaba, tomb of rectangular form; pyramid, which can be a step pyramid (Saqqarah) or smooth sided (Giza); and the hypogeum, underground tomb (Valley of the Kings). The other great building is the temple, a monumental complex preceded by an avenue of sphinxes and obelisks, which give way to two pylons and trapezoid walls, a hypaethros, a hypostyle hall and a shrine. Notable are the temples of Karnak, Luxor, Philae and Edfu. Another type of temple is the rock temple, which has the form of a hypogeum, like in Abu Simbel and Deir el-Bahari.
Painting was characterized by the juxtaposition of overlapping planes. The images were represented hierarchically, i.e. . the Pharaoh is larger than the subjects or enemies at his side. Egyptians painted the head and limbs in profile, while the shoulders and eyes in front. Applied arts were developed significantly in Egypt, in particular woodwork and metalwork, with superb examples like cedar furniture inlaid with ebony and ivory of the tombs at the Egyptian Museum, or the pieces found in Tutankhamun's tomb, which are of great artistic quality.
Historical development.
The field of "art history" was developed in the West, and originally dealt exclusively with European art history, with the High Renaissance (and its Greek precedent) as the defining standard. Gradually, over the course of the 20th century, a wider vision of art history has developed. This expanded version includes societies from across the globe, and it usually attempts to analyze artifacts in terms of the cultural values in which they were created. Thus, art history is now seen to encompass all visual art, from the megaliths of Western Europe to the paintings of the Tang Dynasty in China.
The history of art is often told as a chronology of masterpieces created in each civilization in the world. It can thus be framed as a story of high culture, epitomized by the Seven Wonders of the World, which is somehow different from vernacular expressions. The latter can, however, be integrated into art historical narratives, in which case they are usually referred to as folk arts or craft. The more closely that an art historian engages with these latter forms of low culture, the more likely it is that they will identify their work as examining visual culture or material culture, or as contributing to fields related to art history, such as anthropology or archeology. In the latter cases art objects may be referred to as archeological artifacts.
Textbook art history.
A useful way to examine how art history is organized is through the major survey textbooks. The most often used textbooks published in English are Ernst Gombrich’s "Story of Art", Marilyn Stokstad’s "Art History", Anthony Janson’s "History of Art", David Wilkins, Bernard Schultz, and Katheryn M. Linduff’s "Art Past, Art Present", Helen Gardner’s "Art Through the Ages", Hugh Honour and John Flemming’s "A World History of Art", and Laurie Schneider Adams’s "Art Across Time".
Western Europe.
Although some of the books listed above attempt a global approach, they are universally strong in western art history. The books use representative examples from each era in order to create a story that blends changing styles with social history. The Western narrative begins with prehistoric art such as Stonehenge, before discussing the ancient world. The latter begins with Mesopotamia, then progresses to the art of Ancient Egypt, which then transitions to Classical antiquity. Classical art includes both Greek and Roman work.
With the decline of the Roman Empire, the narrative shifts to Medieval art, which lasted for a millennium. The high intellectual culture of the Medieval period was Islamic, but the era also included Early Christian art, Byzantine art, Anglo-Saxon art, Viking art, Ottonian art, Romanesque art and Gothic art. The Medieval era ended with the Renaissance, followed by the Baroque and Rococo. Sometimes another period, Mannerism, is inserted between Renaissance and Baroque, which is a visual hybrid.
The 18th and 19th centuries included Neoclassicism, Romantic art, Academic art, and Realism in art. Art historians disagree when Modern art began, but it was either in the mid-18th century with the artist Francisco Goya, the mid-19th century with the industrial revolution or the late 19th century with the advent of Impressionism. The art movements of the late 19th through the early 21st centuries are too numerous to detail here, but can be broadly divided into two categories: Modernism and Contemporary art. The latter is sometimes referred to with another term, which has a subtly different connotation, Postmodern art.
Although textbooks periodize Western art by movements, as described above, they also do so by century. Many art historians give a nod to the historical importance of Italian Renaissance and Baroque art by referring to centuries in which it was prominent with foreign terms. These include trecento for the fourteenth, quattrocento for the fifteenth, cinquecento for the sixteenth, seicento for the seventeenth, and settecento for the eighteenth.
The Americas.
The history of art in the Americas begins in pre-Columbian times with Indigenous cultures. Art historians have focused particularly closely on Mesoamerica during this early era, because a series of stratified cultures arose there that erected grand architecture and produced objects of fine workmanship that are comparable to the arts of western Europe. Perhaps the most-read textbook is Mary Ellen Miller’s "The Art of Mesoamerica".
The art-making tradition of Mesoamerican people begins with the Olmec around 1400 BCE, during the Preclassic era. These people are best known for making colossal heads but also carved jade, erected monumental architecture, made small-scale sculpture, and designed mosaic floors. Two of the most well-studied sites artistically are San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán and La Venta. After the Olmec culture declined, the Maya civilization became prominent in the region. Sometimes a transitional Epi-Olmec period is described, which is a hybrid of Olmec and Maya. A particularly well-studied Epi-Olmec site is La Mojarra, which includes hieroglyphic carvings that have been partially deciphered.
By the Late pre-Classic era, beginning around 400 BCE, the Olmec culture had declined but both Central Mexican and Maya peoples were thriving. Throughout much of the Classic period in Central Mexico the city of Teotihuacan was thriving, as were Xochicalco and El Tajin. These sites boasted both grand sculpture and architecture. Other Central Mexican peoples included the Mixtecs, the Zapotecs, and people in the Valley of Oaxaca. Maya art was at its height during the “Classic” period—a name that mirrors that of Classical European antiquity—and which began around 200 CE. Major Maya sites from this era include Copan where numerous stelae were carved in the round, and Quirigua where the largest stelae of Mesoamerica are located along with zoomorphic altars. A complex writing system was developed, and Maya illuminated manuscripts were produced in large numbers on paper made from tree bark. Although Maya cities have existed to the present day, several sites ”collapsed” around 1000.
At the time of the Spanish conquest of Yucatán during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Maya were still powerful, but many communities were paying tribute to Aztec society. The latter culture was thriving, and it included arts such as sculpture, painting, and feather mosaic. Perhaps the most well-known work of Aztec art is the calendar stone, which has become a national symbol of the state of Mexico. During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire many of these artistic objects were sent to Europe, where they were placed in cabinets of curiosities, and later redistributed to art museums. The Aztec empire was based in the city of Tenochtitlan which was largely destroyed during the colonial era. What remains of it was buried beneath Mexico City. A few buildings, such as the foundation of the Templo Mayor have since been unearthed by archaeologists, but they are in poor condition.
Art in the Americas since the conquest has been a mixture of indigenous and foreign traditions, including European, African, and Asian settlers. Thus, books about the visual arts of the United States, such as Francis Pohl’s "Framing America", start with the conquest and reconstruct manifold traditions. Numerous indigenous traditions thrived after the conquest. For example, the Plains Indians created quillwork, beadwork, winter counts, ledger art, and tipis in the pre-reservation era, and afterwards became assimilated into the world of Modern and Contemporary art through institutions such as the Santa Fe Indian School which encouraged students to develop a unique Native American style. Many paintings from that school, now called the Studio Style, were exhibited at the Philbrook Museum of Art during its Indian annual held from 1946-1979.
Intertwined with this story of indigenous art, are movements of painting, sculpture, and architecture such as the Hudson River School and the Ashcan School of the 19th century, and Pop Art and Abstract Expressionism of the 20th. Some of the most celebrated images were produced by artists of the American West, featuring “Cowboys and Indians,” and some of the most visually complex objects were created by African Americans.
Central/Southern/Eastern Asian.
Eastern civilization broadly includes Asia, and it also includes a complex tradition of art making. One Eastern art history survey textbook is John Laplante’s Asian Art. It divides the field by nation, with units on India, China, and Japan.
African.
The long story of African Art includes both high sculpture, perhaps typified by the brass castings of the Benin people, as well as folk art.
Oceanic.
The Art of Oceania includes the geographic areas of Micronesia, Polynesia, Australia, New Zealand, and Melanesia. Nicholas Thomas’s textbook "Oceanic Art" treats the area thematically, with essays on ancestry, warfare, the body, gender, trade, religion, and tourism.
Art museums.
The experience of art history, as conveyed by art museums, tends to be organized differently from that of textbooks due to the nature of collections and the institutions themselves. Rather than a full march through time, museums employ curators who assemble objects into exhibitions, often with unique commentary that is later reinterpreted by docents. Because they have the responsibility to store objects, museums develop taxonomies for their collections, using conventions of classification authority for the sake of consistency. This may be undertaken with the museum’s archivist. The result is often a strong emphasis on the history of media in conjunction with the history of culture.
Such an emphasis on media is a natural outgrowth of the internal classification systems used in art museums, which usually include departments of painting, sculpture, decorative arts, and works on paper. Painting itself includes several media, such as oil painting, Tempera painting, watercolor. Sculpture can be divided into carving and casting. The decorative arts are perhaps the most diverse, as they include: textiles and needlework, which includes weaving, lace, shibori, and other work with fabric; Murals, of which frescoes are one form; and objects of adornment such as silver, ceramics, lacquerware, stained glass, and furniture. Museums generally cannot collect full buildings, but they may acquire pieces of architectural ornamentation, which also fall under the decorative arts department. Works on paper includes printmaking, photography, and the book arts such as illuminated manuscripts. Museums may also include a department of applied arts, which includes objects of good design along with the graphic art, illustration, and other forms of commercial art.
Art market.
The art market can also be used to understand what “counts” as part of art history. Art dealers and auctioneers organize material for distribution to collectors. Two of the largest, and oldest, art auction houses are Sotheby's and Christie's, and each hold frequent sales of great antiquities and art objects.
In addition to upstanding practices, a black market exists for great art, which is closely tied to art theft and art forgery. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but exposés suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security in many parts of the world is low, a thriving trade in illicit antiquities acquired through looting also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of archeological sites, looted art paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent archaeological looting in Iraq.
Nationalist art history.
Both the making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of national superiority or love of one’s country. Russian art is an especially good example of this, as the Russian avant-garde and later Soviet art were attempts to define that country’s identity.
Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, Vasari's Lives of the Artists is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and Heinrich Wölfflin's writings (especially his monograph on Albrecht Dürer) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.
Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the Louvre, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed have a national gallery, with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own cultural heritage. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the United States, but also owns objects from across the world.
Academic art history.
The study of the history of art is a relatively recent phenomenon; prior to the Renaissance, the modern concept of "art" did not exist. Over time, art historians have changed their views about what art is worthy of scrutiny. For example, during the early Victorian era, the 15th-century Italian artists were considered inferior to those of 16th-century High Renaissance. Such a notion was challenged by the Pre-Raphaelite movement. There has since been a trend, dominant in art history of the 21st century, to treat all cultures and periods neutrally. Thus, Australian Aboriginal art would not be deemed better or worse than Renaissance art—it is just different. Art historical analysis has also evolved into studying the social and political use of art, rather than focusing solely on the aesthetic appreciation of its craftsmanship (beauty). What may once have been viewed simply as a masterpiece is now understood as an economic, social, philosophical, and cultural manifestation of the artist's world-view, philosophy, intentions and background.
Sacred art history.
While secular approaches to art history often emphasize individual creativity, the history of sacred art often emphasizes the ways that beautiful objects are used to convey symbolic meaning in ritual contexts. The ten largest organized religions of the world each have image-making traditions. They are Confucianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Bahá'í, Jainism, and Shinto.
Key objects and concepts.
Medieval Western art.
In Byzantine and Gothic art of the Middle Ages, the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical truths. There was no need to depict the reality of the material world, in which man was born in a "state of sin", especially through the extensive use of gold in paintings, which also presented figures in idealised, patterned (i.e."flat") forms.
Renaissance Western art.
The Renaissance is the return yet again to valuation of the material world, and this paradigm shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of landscape.
Eastern art.
Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan.
Religious Islamic art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometric designs instead. However, there are many Islamic paintings which display religious themes and scenes of stories common among the three main monotheistic faiths of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.
Modern and contemporary art.
The physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe depicted by the 18th-century Enlightenment were shattered not only by new discoveries of relativity by Einstein and of unseen psychology by Sigmund Freud, but also by unprecedented technological development accelerated by the implosion of civilization in two world wars. The history of 20th century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, and other art movements cannot be maintained as significant and culturally germane very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as Pablo Picasso being influenced by Iberian sculpture, African sculpture and Primitivism. Japonism, and Japanese woodcuts (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent artistic developments. The influential example set by Paul Gauguin's interest in Oceanic art and the sudden popularity among the cognescenti in early 20th century Paris of newly discovered African fetish sculptures and other works from non-European cultures were taken up by Picasso, Henri Matisse, and by many of their colleagues. 
Modernism, the idealistic search for truth, and progress, gave way in the latter decades of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. Relativity was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the Postmodern period, where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with irony. Furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than regional cultures.
