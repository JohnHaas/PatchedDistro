Government of Niger

The government of Niger is the apparatus through which authority functions and is exercised: the governing apparatus of Nigerien state. The current system of governance, since the Constitution 18 July 1999, is termed the Fifth Republic of Niger. It is a semi-presidential republic, whereby the President of Niger is head of state and the Prime Minister of Niger head of government. The officials holding these posts are chosen through a representative democratic process of national and local elections, in the context of a competing multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature: its Constitutional Court has jurisdiction over constitutional and electoral matters. 
National government, has, since 1999, been supplemented by locally elected officials, who in turn choose representatives at the Departmental and Regional levels. Prior to 1999, these levels of government had always been appointed by the central government.
Central governance is carried out by professional administrative agencies, directed by the Office of the President and/or the Ministries headed by members of the National Assembly appointed to the post by the President. The remainder of Ministry offices are filled by non-political professional administrators. Local governance is carried out by local, departmental, and regional councils, the Ministry of Territorial Collectivities, officials chosen by these elected bodies, and professional government employees. 
Constitution.
The constitution of December 1992 was revised by national referendum on 12 May 1996 and, again, by referendum, revised to the current version on 18 July 1999. It restored the semi-presidential system of government of the December 1992 constitution (Third Republic) in which the president of the republic, elected by universal suffrage for a five-year term, and a prime minister named by the president share executive power. As a reflection of Niger's increasing population, the unicameral National Assembly was expanded in 2004 to 113 deputies elected for a 5-year term under a majority system of representation. Political parties must attain at least 5% of the vote in order to gain a seat in the legislature.
Executive branch.
The Head of State is the President of Niger. Under the 1999 Constitution, the President has many of the powers found under a Presidential System as Head of Government, although the titular Head of Government is the Prime Minister of Niger.
Niger's 1999 constitution restores the semi-presidential system of government of the December 1992 constitution (Third Republic) in which the President of the Republic is elected by universal suffrage for a five-year term, and a prime minister, named by the president, share executive power. The Prime Minister is subject to recall by the National Assembly through a no confidence vote. The President may not remove the Prime Minister, but may dissolve the National Assembly (although this is limited to once every two years). The President, PM, or Legislature may propose legislation. Legislation is subject to Presidential Veto, which may be overridden by the National Assembly by a vote of 50%+1. 
The Constitution of the Fifth Republic differs from that of the Third by giving greater powers to the President. The Third Republic faced intractable political crisis having found itself in 1995 in a "Cohabitation": a Prime Minister and President of different parties which were unable to forge a working consensus. The Fifth Republic resembles the Semi-Presidential system seen in the French Fifth Republic. 
Ministries of Niger.
Executive power is exercised through Ministerial appointment, made by the President of the Republic and authorised by the National Assembly. Ministers are seated in the Council of Ministers, which meets to advise the President and carry out his policies.
Legislative branch.
The National Assembly ("Assemblée Nationale") has 113 members, elected for a five-year term, 105 members elected in multi-seat constituencies and 8 members elected in single-seat national minority constituencies. The multi-seat constituency members are elected using a party-list ("Scrutin du liste") proportional representation system. For these seats, political parties must attain at least 5% of the vote in order to gain a seat in the legislature. The remaining eight seats are single constituency, elected by a first-past-the-post system. One element of the Judiciary of Niger, the High Court of Justice, is composed of Deputies elected from within the National Assembly.
The National Assembly has oversight of the executive in voting legislation, override of Presidential veto, vote of no-confidence of the Prime Minister, and the reserved right to nominate the Prime Minister. As well, the Assembly has recourse to publicly investigate the executive through Committee Hearings, Hearing in plenary sittings, Commissions of inquiry, formal parliamentary questions, "Question time", and Interpellations. There is no formal parliamentary Ombudsman oversight of government. 
Judicial branch.
Niger's independent judicial system is composed of four higher courts — the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court, the High Court of Justice and the Court of State Security.
Other high government bodies.
The 1999 constitution, as well as law since that date, created a number of government bodies. These are executive bodies, but which answer to both the National Assembly and the Presidency in varying degrees. For instance, the Nigerien National Commission on Human Rights and Fundamental Liberties is constitutionally mandated to be independent of all other bodies, reports to the president, and through later law has each member mandated to be chosen by a different non-governmental body (For instance, Human Rights commissions, Press unions, Legal professional organisations) and then approved by the President. Members tend to serve fixed terms and cannot be dismissed by other government officials. The rules for oversight, term, nomination, and approval of members of these bodies is different for each.
Administrative divisions.
The country is currently divided into eight Regions: Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Tahoua, Tillaberi, Zinder and Niamey ( a capital district of coequal authority to a Region). These Regions are subdivided into 36 Departments. Administrative powers are also distributed among 265 communes. 
Current administrative structure.
The Regions are subdivided into Departments and communes. As of 2005, there were 36 "départements", divided into 265 "communes", 122 "cantons" and 81 "groupements". The latter two categories cover all areas not covered by "Urban Communes" (population over 10000) or "Rural Communes" (population under 10000), and are governed by the Department, whereas Communes have (since 1999) elected councils and mayors. Additional semi-autonomous sub-divisions include "Sultanates", "Provinces" and "Tributaries" ("tribus"). The Nigerien government estimates there are an additional 17000 Villages administered by "Rural Communes", while there are a number of "Quartiers" (boroughs or neighborhoods) administered by "Urban Communes". 
Restructuring.
Prior to the devolution program on 1999-2006, these Regions were styled Departments. Confusingly, the next level down (Arrondissements) were renamed Departments. 
1992 division.
Tillabéri department was created in 1992, when Niamey Region (then called "Niamey department") was split, with the area immediately outside Niamey renamed as the "Niamey Urban Community", operating as co-equal with the other seven Regions of Niger.
Historical evolution.
Prior to independence, Niger was divided into sixteen Cercles as second level administration divisions: Agadez, Birni N'Konni, Dogondoutchi, Dosso, Filingué, Gouré, Madaoua, Magaria, Maradi, N'Guigmi, Niamey, Tahoua, Téra, Tessaoua, Tillabéry, and Zinder. Their capitals had the same names as the cercle.
After independence, the "31 December 1961 Law of territorial organization" created 31 "circonscriptions". The 16 colonial cercles continued to exist, and served as a level of division above these circonscriptions. Four cercles (Dogondoutchi, Filingué, N'Guigmi, and Téra) had only one circonscription. The "Law of August 14 1964" then reorganized the country into seven departments, adopting the French second level administration naming system, in contrast to neighbor Mali, which retained the colonial Cercles and Regions.
Enforcement and force.
The civilian central government of Niger maintains a monopoly on force within its borders. Both the Military of Niger and Law enforcement trace their authority eventually to the President of the Republic, through Ministries and their controlling Minister. The Military and Gendarmerie (Police responsible for enforcement outside urban areas) are commanded through the Minister of Defence of Nigeria. The "Police Nationale" and the Nigerien Internal Security Forces (FNIS) paramilitary police are controlled through the Ministry of the Interior of Niger.The Judicial and Tax police ("Douanes") are controlled through the Ministry of Finance. All ministries ultimately report to the Head of State.
Foreign Affairs.
Foreign relations are carried out by the President, as Head of State, as well as through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Niger. Treaties are subject to consultation by the National Assembly and the Constitutional Court has jurisdiction to rule upon compliance with international treaties and agreements.
International organization participation.
Niger is member of ACCT, ACP, AfDB, CCC, ECA, ECOWAS, Entente, FAO, FZ, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICFTU, ICRM, IDA, IDB, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, Intelsat, Interpol, IOC, ITU, MIPONUH, NAM, OAU, OIC, OPCW, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, UNWTO, UPU, WADB, WAEMU, WCL, WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WTO

Bluebird (Marvel Comics)

Bluebird (Sally Avril), sometimes rendered BlueBird, is a supporting character in Marvel Comics's Spider-Man series. Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, she first appeared in "Amazing Fantasy" #15 (1962).
Publication history.
Sally was a minor member of Flash Thompson's entourage, appearing in only one issue during the Silver Age. Her "Bluebird" career was created by Busiek (scripts) and Olliffe (pencils) in 1996.
Fictional character biography.
Sally Avril was a fellow student of Peter Parker's at Midtown High who turned him down for a date, preferring the more handsome and muscular Flash Thompson.
Thirty years later, writing for "Untold Tales of Spider-Man", Kurt Busiek resurrected the one-note brunette from obscurity and gave her a background. She was an ambitious, thrill-loving girl who took blue ribbons in gymnastics. With fellow popular kid Jason Ionello, she attempted to cash in on a "Daily Bugle" contest offering a thousand dollars to a reader who brought in pictures of Spider-Man. Although their mission was a bust, Sally loved the thrill and became very smitten with the web-slinger when he touched her cheek just before leaving her and Jason with a warning to give it up.
Sally and Jason tailed Spidey again, who was (unwillingly) working for Electro. The flash from Sally's camera roused Spidey from his hypnotic state, and a well-placed kick by the athletic young Sally took Electro by surprise long enough for Spidey to readjust his mask — which Electro had been preparing to remove — and defeat him. Spider-Man posed for a shot with an ecstatic Sally and Jason that the "Bugle" ran.
Suffused with glee, Sally tried to get a permanent gig on the "Bugle", but was told the photographer's job was filled — by Peter Parker. Peter admitted this but asked her not to tell their fellow Midtowners. Sally donned an eccentric blue-and-white costume and decided, with her aerobic skills, to become a superheroine. She asked Peter to take some "Bugle" pics of her doing some stunts, but Peter refused. Angered, she threatened to blackmail him by revealing that he took Spider-Man pictures, but he undercut her by telling them himself.
Bluebird's zeal but lack of experience caused trouble for Spider-Man during fights with Scarlet Beetle and Electro. Her "ether egg" weapons would detonate prematurely or have little effect, once even allowing the villain to escape. Considering her more trouble than she was worth, Spider-Man allowed the Black Knight's men to hurt her quite badly in order to dissuade her from interfering in his fights again, although he later felt remorseful.
Bruised but undaunted, Sally and Jason headed to an area where Spider-Man was fighting the Knight, with Sally's camera. She intended to capture some shots of the fight. However, Sally's zeal ended up costing her her life when she begged Jason to speed in his car, and the two ran a red light. Their car struck an oncoming bus, with Jason incurring mild head trauma, and Sally being killed.
Spider-Man felt horrible about this. ""She'll never laugh again... She'll never toss her head the way she did, instantly dismissing whatever she didn't want to think about in favor of something new. She'll never smile, never capture everyone's attention with a few words, never light up a room with her determination and humor. She could be obnoxious, even pushy, but she was vital and alive and fun to be around and now she's gone.""
Powers and abilities.
Bluebird possessed no superhuman powers and used the following gadgets to fight crime: a retractable rope-line, insulated boots to protect her from electricity, blue paint pellets and ether-filled "Bluebird's Eggs". Avril was also a skilled gymnast.

Nash Buckingham

Theophilus Nash Buckingam (31 May 1880 - 10 March 1971), commonly referred to as Nash Buckingham, was an American author and conservationist from Tennessee. He is perhaps most famous for writing a collection of short stories entitled De Shootinest Gent'man.
Buckingham was considered one of the most widely renowned and best-loved outdoor writers of his time and remains a favorite to many present-day readers of the genre. He wrote nine books and hundreds of articles that regularly appeared in such magazines as "Outdoor Life", "Field & Stream", and "Sports Afield" and "Recreation". His writings were often accompanied by photographs taken by the author himself. 
An avid shotgunner and wing shot, Buckingham was considered an authority on topics relating to waterfowl and upland birds, as well as the methods and tools used to hunt them. Although Buckingham pursued a variety of game in his lifetime, if his own writing is a true indication, it would seem that "Mr. Buck" possessed a special fondness for ducks and quail. He was active in a number of outdoor related activities such as Field Judging and a dedicated and influential participant in a number of worthy causes devoted to the betterment of hunting, sporting literature and the preservation of the American outdoor tradition. As such, Buckingham was given a number of prestigious awards for having used his voice to help the cause of conservation. He spoke out often and eloquently about the necessity of enforcing game laws and was a staunch advocate of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

Richard Rigg (British politician)

Richard Rigg (1877 – 29 August 1942) was a British Liberal Party politician who defected to the Conservatives. 
Born in Kendal, Cumberland, Rigg was elected at the 1900 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Appleby division of Westmorland. Aged only 23, his majority of 11% was a surprise, since Appleby had returned only Conservatives since 1885.
However, Rigg resigned from the Liberal party in November 1904 because he found himself in agreement with the Conservative government on so many key issues. The Liberals then selected Leif Jones as their candidate for the imminent by-election, and although campaigning began before Christmas, there was as yet no vacancy. Rigg claimed that the “ruffianism” of Liberals angry at his defection of the party had made him ill, and he went to an unnamed continental health resort to recover. He returned to England in February 1905, and resigned his seat 11 February 1905 by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead, telling the annual dinner of the Carlisle Conservative Club "I am proud to be one of you now ... I have the satisfaction of feeling that what I have done was conscientious and right." At the resulting by-election on 2 March 1905, Jones held the seat, though with a reduced majority.
Rigg subsequently served as a councillor on Westminster City Council, representing Great Marlborough ward from February 1924 to November 1925, and St Margaret ward from February 1930 until his death. He was elected Mayor of Westminster for 1939–40. He was a member of the Municipal Reform Party, the local government wing of the Conservatives. 
He died at Hove, East Sussex in 1942, aged 65.

The park is approximately one mile up Provo Canyon, and sits at the foot of Mount Timpanogos. Laughing Night, the final event of the festival, is usually performed at the SCERA Shell, an outdoor amphitheater where the audience sits on a large, sloped lawn around a central stage.

Storytellers included Donald Davis, David Holt, Bil Lepp, Carmen Deedy, Charlotte Blake-Alston, Syd Leiberman, Connie Regan-Blake, Barbara McBride Smith, John McCutcheon, Bill Harley, Heather Forest and Angela Lloyd.
Artist James C. Christensen, who created the paintings Tales Beneath Timp (also known as Once Upon a Time) and Tales Beyond Timp, both featuring a character known as "The Storyteller," created a new Storyteller painting for the occasion. He was also available for autographs.
About the Festival.
The largest storytelling festival in the West - the Timpanogos Storytelling Festival - held every year in Orem, Utah at the close of August. Some of the nation's best known storytellers unite with other tellers, both young and old, for two all-day celebrations of music, merriment, but mostly stories. 
In addition to the daytime activities held at Mt. Timpanogos Park in Provo Canyon on Friday and Saturday, there will be public performances in the evenings, such as "Look Who's Talking, "Bedtime Stories," "My Favorite Stories" and "Laughin' Night." Before the main Festival begins, attendees may also attend storytelling workshops held on Thursday morning and afternoon at the Orem Public Library, given by four of the featured storytellers. These workshops are registered separately from other Festival events, but will enhance the listener's understanding and enjoyment of Festival storytelling.
History.
The Idea-In 1989, Karen Ashton, President of the Friends of the Orem Public Library, was looking for projects to promote community involvement in the Library. Mrs. Ashton had been volunteering at the Library for years, presenting Storytime for preschoolers and helping with other Children's Library programs. When she saw an advertisement for a National Storytelling Festival in Tennessee, she decided to attend and gather more ideas for stories and programs for the Orem Library.
She went to the National Festival expecting to find ladies telling stories to children in a library. Instead she found thousands of adults crowding into tents, listening to dynamic performers relating tales of history, culture, folk and family life, as well as magical stories of “what if . . .!” The entire town of Jonesborough (population 3,000) had mobilized to accommodate the 10,000+ people who annually attend the three-day festival.
Mrs. Ashton recognized in the storytelling festival the idea she was searching for. A festival brings people together and increases understanding by allowing them to communicate through stories. It fosters the simple, old community and family values—family members and neighbors talking with each other again, sharing family history and experiences. A storytelling festival is an active experience, not passive entertainment. 
The Beginning-The Friends launched the first Timpanogos Storytelling Festival just eight months after Mrs. Ashton presented the idea. The Ashton family opened their home to the community, set up performance areas on their property, and persuaded neighbors to do the same. Livestock was moved, fields mowed, and tents raised. Three Eastern storytellers of national fame and local talent including James Arrington, Marvin Payne, and Gaye Beeson performed for two incredible days.
News of the Festival spread rapidly. By the second year the Friends had expanded the hours of the Festival, planned an additional evening performance at [http://www.scera.org/contents/view/16/scera_shell.html], borrowed another field for a fourth performance tent, and invited school groups to the Friday morning performances. Five of the best storytellers in the nation were on the program, and auditions had been held to determine the successful regional tellers. Acoustic musicians performed during the intermissions throughout the day, supplementing performances by storytellers on the fiddle, banjo, harmonica, and spoons.
Now-The Timpanogos Storytelling Festival has grown each year—in both audience size and prestige. Attendance at annual Festival events total 26,000 and the Festival is recognized throughout the national storytelling world as a standard setter. The Festival and its organizers have received national media attention and awards. Storytelling event organizers from around the nation attend the Timpanogos Festival for training. The Timpanogos Storytelling Festival has garnered this reputation not only because of the great talent featured, but also because of the scenic setting, the terrific audience, the extraordinary community support, and its excellence in organization.
In 1999, the National Storytelling Network honored Karen Ashton with the Leadership Award in recognition of her exemplary leadership and significant contributions to the community through storytelling. In the same year, the Utah Storytelling Guild (spawned by the Festival and now supporting the Festival) received the National Storytelling Network Service Award. Janet Low, Festival Coordinator, was awarded the Service Award in 2000 and Debi Richan, Festival Vice-President, received this national award in 2004. 
The Festival draws individuals and groups from across the nation and Canada. The Utah Valley Visitors Center provides material on attractions and accommodations in Utah County to ticket-buyers living outside of Utah and Salt Lake Counties. Families spend vacations in Utah, planned around the Timpanogos Festival. The reputation of the area has spread—even the national storytellers bring their families to spend additional time enjoying the scenery and attractions of Utah County. 
The Timpanogos Storytelling Festival has become the “National Festival of the West.” It will preserve through stories, music and art, the memories of Utah and the West while creating a forum to explore cultures beyond the West.
In 2005, the Festival opened at the new Mt. Timpanogos Park in Provo Canyon. Designed by the City of Orem for the annual Festival, the park allows Festival growth to continue with more and larger performance tents. 
The Timpanogos Festival is not a small event. It requires significant donations from businesses and foundations and thousands of volunteer hours from individuals and community groups such as the American Legion, Kiwanis, Golden Kiwanis, youth groups, student clubs, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, and the Utah Storytelling Guild. 
Considering all the work involved with organizing an annual Festival, Karen Ashton commented, "If just one family leaves the Festival and begins to share stories with each other, it will be worth it."

In addition to donations from business' and non-profits the Orem Storytelling Festival will receive $15,000.00 in Federal Stimulus funds in 2010 making it an official federally subsidized event.

Buzluq

Buzluq (also, Bouzloukh, Buzluk, Buzlukh, and Buzuluk - meaning "cold, iced" in Azerbaijani) is a village and municipality in the Goranboy Rayon of Azerbaijan. It has a population of 315. The municipality consists of the villages of Buzluq, Gülüstan, and Başqışlaq.
Prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union, it was populated by Armenians. During the Soviet time the people of Buzluq were engaged mainly in agriculture with considerable achievements due to heavy subsidization policy by the Azerbaijan SSR government. 
With the outbreak of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan people of Buzluq were armed by Armenia. The village served as a base for armed raids against the civilian population of the surrounding Azerbaijani villages of Shafag and Zeyve. Those actions were supported by Soviet forces stationed in the area. But in May 1991 Buzluq itself became a target of Soviet Operation Ring which ordered by Moscow as a punishment for Armenia's boycott of a referendum held on the future status of the Soviet Union. In the fall of 1991, Armenian forces captured the village, which was recaptured together with the whole Shahumyan district by Azerbaijani forces in June 1992.
Buzluq was one of 13 Armenian villages of the former Shahumyan rural district of Azerbaijan, which are now integrated into Goranboy Rayon. 
Other Armenian villages in the former Shahumyan were: Gulistan, Verin Shen, Erkech, Nerkin Shen (the region administrative center), Manashid, Hay Paris, Karachinar, Mnasin Shen, and Kharkhapor. Almost all these villages are now populated by Azerbaijani refugees displaced from Vardenis, Krasnoselsk and other regions of Armenia in 1988.
Historically Azeri populated villages nearby are Todan, Gurzallar, Bashkyshlagh, Shefeg, and Zeyva.
Russian Molokans' village: Rus Paris.
From 17,000 population of region, 85% were Armenians, others were Azeri.

Bell's hinge-back tortoise

Bell's hinge-back tortoise ("Kinixys belliana") is a species of African tortoise, from the family Testudinidae. It has the hinge that characterizes all tortoises in the genus "Kinixys". 
There are several subspecies (some of which may actually be separate species; see below) and the Bell's hinge-back tortoise is subject to wide variation throughout its extensive range.
Etymology.
Both the specific name, "belliana", and the common name are in honor of English zoologist Thomas Bell. 
Description.
Bell's hinge-back tortoise is a medium-sized light brown tortoise. They can grow up to 22 cm. On the back of its shell, the tortoise has a 90 degree hinge which, when closed, can protect its rear legs and tail from predators. This broad band of flexible connective tissue is located between the 4th and 5th costals and the 7th and 8th peripherals in adults. 
The scutes on its slightly domed and elongated shell typically have a radiating pattern of dark patches, though these can fade. Adult males have a concave belly. Most Bell's hinge-backs have five claws on each forefoot except for one of the subspecies, "K. b. nogeuyi".
Distribution and habitat.
In its habitat, Bell's hinge-back tortoise favours tropical and sub-tropical savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa. 
It was traditionally considered to be the most common and widespread hinge-back tortoise, found throughout a large part of sub-Saharan Africa such as in Sudan, Tanzania, DR Congo and down to southern Africa. 
However, a revision of the species advocated by Kindler "et al." (2012) would restrict it only to the central African populations, ranging from Angola to Burundi. 
Diet.
Bell's hinge-back tortoise is an omnivore, with a very varied diet consisting mainly of a range of different plants, but also including insects and other meat. 
It feeds on vegetables, twigs, roots, leaves, fruits, earthworms, snails, tadpoles and other small invertebrates.
Threats and conservation.
In its natural habitat, its predators are leopards, hawks, and eagles. 
Currently it is mainly threatened by widespread collection from the wild for the illegal international trade in the species. It is also collected by local peoples for food and human population growth in the area is putting pressure on the species. Human-induced fire is also a threat.
Subspecies.
Kindler "et al." (2012) raised the subspecies "K. b. zombensis" (which they considered a senior synonym of "K. b. domerguei") and "K. b. nogeuyi" to the ranks of separate species.
Parasites of hinge-back tortoises.
"Kinixys" tortoises play host to a number of ectoparasites (external) and endoparasites (internal) A survey (by Alan Probert & Clive Humphreys) of mixed captive "K. spekii" and "K. belliana" (mostly "K. spekii") in Zimbabwe showed that ticks (Arachnida) and roundworms (Nematoda) of genera "Angusticium", "Atractis" and "Tachygontria" infect these tortoises. This has been reported by others as well. However, some of the tiny roundworms (photographed under SEM) are very likely new species and as yet remain undescribed.

Love Shy (Thinking About You)

"Love Shy (Thinking About You)" (often shortened to Love Shy) is the second single by UK bassline group Platnum. It was released after the success of "What's It Gonna Be" with H "Two" O.
It is a cover version of Danish singer Kristine Blond's 1997 hit "Love Shy", the Club Asylum remix of the track became a UK Garage club classic.
The original version of "Love Shy" had been given a bassline makeover by the respected DJ/producer Shaun 'Banger' Scott at the end of 2007. The remix was well received in the bassline scene, this is possibly the reason that Platnum decided to produce their own version.
Chart.
On October 5, 2008, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at #20 on downloads alone and peaked at #12.

Gilgai

A gilgai is a small, ephemeral lake formed from a depression in the soil surface in expanding clay soils. Additionally, the term "gilgai" is used to refer to the overall micro-relief in such areas, consisting of mounds and depressions, not just the lakes themselves. The name comes from the Australian Aboriginal word meaning small water hole. These pools are commonly a few metres across and less than deep, however in some instances they may be several metres deep and up to across. Gilgais are found worldwide wherever cracking clay soils and pronounced wet and dry seasons are present. Gilgais are also called melonholes, crabholes, hogwallows or puff and shelf formations.
Gilgais are thought to form in vertisols through repeated cycles of swelling of the clay when wet and subsequent shrinkage upon drying. This action, known as argilliturbation, causes the soil to crack when dry and loose soil material then fills these cracks. When the soil swells upon subsequent re-wetting the soil pressure cannot be dispersed into the now-full cracks and the soil is forced sideways causing a mound to form between cracks and a depression to form at the location of the crack. The process is then further exaggerated by the depressions holding water and thus becoming wetter and swelling more than the mounds, causing even greater shrinkage and cracking. In addition, the cracks channel water deeply into the soil causing even greater swelling and subsequent cracking of the depression areas. Each cycle of swelling, shrinkage and cracking becomes more exaggerated and the landscape eventually becomes covered by a repeated pattern of mounds and depressions. The depressions hold surface water during the wet seasons.
Australia has an abundance of cracking clay soils and a large areas dominated by very pronounced wet and dry seasons providing ideal circumstances for the formation of gilgais. Areas outside Australia that also have the necessary conditions for gilgai formation include central Russia and several parts of the United States. Gilgais are structurally similar to the patterned ground of frigid regions, however periglacial soil polygons are formed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles rather than the soil moisture cycles that create gilgai.
Gilgais were an important source of water for Indigenous Australians and enabled people to seasonally forage over areas that lacked permanent water. Similarly, they allowed the stock of early Australian pastoralists to seasonally graze these areas. The introduction of water wells and pumps has reduced the value of gilgais to humans as a source of water. Gilgais are now generally considered a nuisance by farmers. The movement of soil associated with gilgai formation damages infrastructure including building foundations, roads and railway lines and the undulations produced interfere with crop harvesting. The presence of seasonal water in grazing land makes it more difficult to control stock and provides a water supply for vermin such as feral pigs and kangaroos.
Gilgais remain of great ecological significance as a source of water for animal and plant life. Crayfish burrow in the wet basins and ants build up the mounds, magnifying the formations through bioturbation.

Foreign Service Institute (FSI) India is the institute in New Delhi where Indian Foreign Service officers are trained. The Institute functions under the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. The Institute is headed by the Dean of the Foreign Service Institute, who is an officer of the Indian Foreign Service of the rank of Secretary/ Additional Secretary to the Government of India. Other officers deputed to the institute are - two Joint Secretaries, a Deputy Secretary and an Under Secretary; but this composition may change from time to time. The institute, within its premises, also has an hostel and a few flats for the Officer Trainees of the Indian Foreign Service and other officials on deputation to the institute respectively. 
The Foreign Service Institute was established by the Government of India in 1986 primarily to cater to the professional training needs of the trainees of the Indian Foreign Service and use to run from two rooms in Akbar Bhawan. The training programme of the Indian diplomats goes on for about a year, during which they are taught various aspects of India's foreign policy, international relations, Indian history and culture, Indian and the world economic scenario, communication and interpersonal skills, and the like, before they take up posting within the Ministry of External Affairs and sent abroad later.
The FSI's activities were later diversified to include courses of interest to all levels of officers of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and also to other officers of the civil services of India. The Institute also conducts courses for Diplomats of other countries. This course is known as Professional Course For Foreign Diplomats(PCFD). The FSI moved to its new building in 2007 in the old JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University) campus in New Delhi.

South Africa–Turkey relations

South Africa – Turkey relations refers to the current and historical relations between the Republic of South Africa and Republic of Turkey. Formal diplomatic relations were established at consular level in 1991 and consulates-general were opened in Istanbul and Johannesburg respectively. Both consulates were closed following the upgrading of relations to ambassadorial level in October 1992. South Africa has an embassy in Ankara. Turkey has an embassy in Pretoria. From 1998, Turkey has maintained a Consulate General in Cape Town with jurisdiction over the Western, Northern and Eastern Cape Provinces. The post is filled by the current incumbent in an honorary capacity, Adv Glenn Babb.
Historical relations.
The forerunner to Turkey, the Ottoman Empire, established relations with colonial South Africa, which was then part of the British Empire, in 1861 with the appointment of a Mr. de Roubaix to Istanbul. A Mr. Bettelheim was sent from the Ottoman Empire to Cape Town in 1889. Bettelheim remained in the post of consul to South Africa until 1896. The Ottomans also maintained consulates in Durban and Johannesburg. Relations between the Ottoman Empire and South Africa were maintained until the outbreak of World War I, when the Ottomans entered the war on the side of the German Empire, whereas the Union of South Africa entered alongside the British. Prior to the outbreak of the war, a new consular arrived in Cape Town, Mehmet Remzi Bey. He was interned during the war by British authorities and died in 1916. He was buried in Johannesburg.
Religious relations.
In 1863, a qadi, or Islamic judge, was sent by the Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz to teach the Muslim population in Cape Town. The judge was Abu Bakr Effendi and he was credited with introducing the fez for men, as well as reinstating the hijab for women. More importantly, besides his role as teacher he also published the Arabic Afrikaans "Uiteensetting van die godsdiens" ("Bayan ad-Din", or "The Exposition of the Religion") in 1877. He married a British woman and died in South Africa in 1880.
Turkey and the apartheid government.
Turkey stood in consistent opposition to the white minority governments in South Africa. It did not maintain any type of relations until negotiations began between the African National Congress and the government towards democratic elections. Turkey also promoted the independence of Namibia, which was under the occupation of South Africa from World War I until October 1990.
Post-apartheid relations.
South Africa and Turkey normalized relations following the democratic elections of 1994 in South Africa. The government of South Africa maintained a similar position on Kurdish nationalism as the Turkish Republic.

Computer-integrated surgery

Computer-integrated surgery focuses on computer-based techniques, systems, and applications exploiting quantitative information from medical images and sensors to assist clinicians in all phases of treatment, from diagnosis to preoperative planning, execution, and follow-up. It emphasizes the relationship between problem definition, computer-based technology, and clinical application.
Overview.
Russel Taylor has argued that “The impact of Computer-Integrated Surgery (CIS) on medicine in the next 20 years will be as great as that of Computer-Integrated Manufacturing on industrial production over the past 20 years.” One advantage of Computer-Integrated Surgery over normal surgery, is that it is minimally-invasive. These computers combine doctor-created models which are specific to each patient, with an optimal surgical plan. The result is a surgery that is tailored to the specific needs of each patient, as well as safe and minimally invasive. The doctors and computer systems they use combine images and other information about a patient with “atlas” (overall or general) information about human anatomy to help doctors plan how to treat the patient. As the surgery is being performed, the patient-specific plan and model are updated in real-time. The system makes use of a variety of technologies, including robots and “augmented reality” displays to assist the surgeon in carrying out the procedure safely and accurately. Doctors then use the same technology to assist in the patient follow-up. This allows the doctors to use statistics gathered from data from the surgery as a quality control to help improve the overall efficacy and safety of the surgery.
Uses.
Computer-Integrated Surgery is used most commonly for orthopedic surgery, such as knee or hip replacements, which call for a surgery tailored to the unique needs of the individual patient. For these reasons, it is also used for soft-tissue surgery such as the removal of tumors.
Plan of action.
Patient-specific information is gathered. This information can come from a variety of sources including
computed tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) just to name a few. This information about the patient is then taken and combined with current statistical information about human anatomy, its physiology and disease. This information is used to create a computer model of the patient, which is then used to create an optimal surgical plan. 
While in the operating room, this patient model and surgical plan must be "registered" to the patient. Doctors do this by finding anatomical structures or markers on the patient and their corresponding model to create a map of sorts. This is extremely helpful as if the patient's anatomy changes, all that need be done is update their respective model and surgical plan. The procedure is then carried out with the assistance of robots. As the procedure is performed, additional imaging monitors the patient's vitals and the procedure's progress in order to verify that the procedure has been executed correctly. 
After the surgery, further imaging and modeling is done for the patient follow-up and to see if additional
surgery is necessary.
Factors affecting wide-spread use.
There are a number of factors that researchers developing new robotics and techniques, as well as the doctors who implement them need to consider before this technology can become more commonplace. For one, the advantages of this form of surgery are often difficult to measure as the results can take a while to assess and be interpreted.
Advantages.
Quality: Computer-Integrated Surgery can improve the quality of surgical technique used by doctors, thus reducing the need for revision surgery to repair mistakes made in the initial surgery. 
Reduces time and cost: Computer-Integrated Surgery can improve the speed and reduce the cost of some types of surgery. Since the surgery is tailored for each individual patient, it allows doctors to more quickly and efficiently perform the surgery, as well as reducing costs that arise from healing and revision surgery. 
Less invasive: Computer-Integrated Surgery is less invasive as the procedure is so well planned beforehand, is tailored to the needs of the individual patient, and takes advantage of feedback from previous surgeries. Since the procedure is less invasive, it also reduces infection risk, recovery time and cost. 
Safety: Computer-Integrated Surgery reduces the possibility of surgical complications and errors which, again, lowers costs and reduces recovery times.
Disadvantages.
There are some disadvantages to using this new technology.
Poor judgment: As opposed to doctors, robots inherently have poor judgment, being unable to adapt to situations as they arise. 
Limited dexterity: Whereas a human's hands are very dexterous and able to take many different shapes and perform a variety of tasks, robots lack this dexterity and as such make performing very fine movements much more difficult.
Research.
Computer-Integrated Surgery is generally led by the group ERC CISST: Computer Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology. The ERC CISST state their mission as "that of developing surgical systems that integrate novel computer and human/machine interface technologies that will revolutionize surgical procedures, extending the surgeon's abilities to achieve better outcomes at lower costs." 
CISST is currently affiliated with the following companies:
Acoustic MedSystems, Inc.
American Shared Hospital Services
Foster-Miller 
GE Healthcare 
Hologic, Inc.
Intuitive Surgical, Inc. 
Medtronic 
Northern Digital, Inc.
Philips 
Siemens.
Johns Hopkins University, led by Doctor Russel Taylor has been the lead institution for all Computer-Integrated Surgery research and work. 
Some universities are doing research in this area including Johns Hopkins University, MIT and Carnegie Mellon University.

Millennium Wrestling Federation

The Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF) is a New England independent professional wrestling promotion based in Melrose, Massachusetts. Founded in January 2001 by promoters Dan Mirade & Neil Manolian, the MWF is one of the top promotions in the Northeastern United States along with Chaotic Wrestling, New England Championship Wrestling and Yankee Pro Wrestling. 
Among the wrestlers who have appeared in the promotion include independent wrestlers Abyss, A.J. Styles, Kofi Kingston, Joey Mercury, Antonio Thomas, Chris Sabin, Alex Shelley, Rick Fuller, Homicide, and "Hurricane" John Walters.
Due to its close working relationship with World Wrestling Entertainment, the promotion is one of several on the independent circuit to regularly feature a large number of former World Wrestling Federation veterans including "Road Dog" Jesse James Armstrong, Scotty 2 Hotty, Al Snow, Kamala, Demolition (Ax and Smash) and MWF President Paul Bearer. Former WWF World Heavyweight Champion The Iron Sheik served as MWF Lt. Commissioner. Others who have also made appearances include The Missing Link, Bob Orton, Jr. and Ox Baker.
John Cena, Sr., the father of multi-time World Heavyweight Champion John Cena, took control of the promotion in September 2007 after buying out Chairman Neil Manolian's partial stock in the company. Cena became MWF South President after a confrontation with Paul Bearer at Soul Survivor VIII.
History.
The Millennium Wrestling Federation was founded by Dan Mirade & Neil Manolian in January 2001, partly founded in memory of longtime Boston promoter Tony Rumble, and held their first show on September 28 of that year. Based in Melrose, Massachusetts, the promotion regularly began running shows in the greater Boston area for over a year before the debut of its weekly half-hour television program "MWF Xtra" on Labor Day weekend. The show was hosted by Dan Mirade and MWF on-air personalities The Jackal & Dr. Brad Von Johnson as well as special guest Tiger Mulligan, who would later win the promotion's Heavyweight Championship defeating "2Xtreme" John Brooks in the tournament finals of the "Soul Survivor" competition at the "Soul Survivor I" supercard to crown the first MWF Heavyweight Champion and was presented the championship belt by Bobby "The Brain" Heenan.
On October 5, 2002, Gary Michael Cappetta & Superstar Billy Graham appeared at a MWF benefit show at the America Civic Center in Wakefield, Massachusetts. The card also featured Road Dogg and the MWF debuts of "Die Hard" Eddie Edwards & Todd Hanson.
A second show, "MWF ULTRA", was also introduced with its first episode on October 12, 2003 but eventually became a monthly, one hour special in October 2004. Its guests have included Johnny Fabulous, Karl Lauer, Scotty 2 Hotty, Demolition Smash, The Iron Sheik, Percy Pringle and actress Brigitte Nielsen. In addition to its wide use of regional cable TV throughout the New England area, the promotion also began broadcasting its shows via internet broadcast and in-demand in May 2005 and became available in over 60 countries. That same year, the two more championships were created with "Die Hard" Eddie Edwards winning a tournament for the MWF Television Championship and, at "MWF Iron Sheik Appreciation Night", Todd Hanson and Beau Douglas won a Tag Team Royal Rumble eliminating The Islanders for the titles. The MWF Heavyweight Championship, which had since become vacant, was won by Dylan Kage when he defeated Slyck Wagner Brown on the first episode of "MWF ULTRA". 
On November 11, 2005, the "Soul Survivor III" supercard featured MWF Heavyweight Champion Dylan Kage joining forces with Paul Bearer defeating Luis Ortiz, and MWF Television Champion Eddie Edwards defending his title against Fergal Devitt & John Walters in the main event in Lynn, Massachusetts. The show also featured Test, The Sandman, The Missing Link and Ox Baker . NWA Ireland wrestler Fergal Devitt appeared at several MWF events while in New England during his 2005-2006 US tour. Facing Eddie Edwards and John Walters in a triple treat for the MWF TV Title, the match ended after 15 minutes when Edwards pinned Walters for the title. This match, gained considerable attention on the US independent scene.
Involved in fundraising and other community projects, the Millennium Wrestling Federation's on-going "Keep The Kids Off The Streets" Campaign presents live wrestling events in inner city neighborhoods. Its efforts in fundraising activities has raised tens of thousands of dollars for a number of charities and non-profit organizations including the American Red Cross, the Special Olympics and has received extensive press coverage from The Boston Globe, The Howard Stern Show, KISS 108 FM, the Eddie Andelman Show, CN8 Sports Pulse and ESPN Radio. The promotion has also been involved in promoting other non-wrestling events in Boston such as hosting the Boston premiere of "The Condemned" (including a Q&A with "Stone Cold" Steve Austin) and The Iron Sheik's appearance on Toronto's Hi-Fi Network and promoting the Wrestling's Living Legends reunion on the morning of WrestleMania 23 in Windsor, Ontario. The event also featured Demolition (Ax and Smash) in their first appearance in sixteen years. 
In September 2007, MWF Chairman Neil Manolian sold his share of the promotion to John Cena, Sr., giving him majority control of the company, and as a result, was named MWF President three months later, replacing on-air personality The Jackal who had been appointed to the position at the beginning of the year. During the first half of 2008, a number of wrestlers from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling appeared for the promotion. On March 29, the promotion held its first show in Nashua, New Hampshire at "Live Free or Die". 
On June 21, the MWF held the final professional wrestling event at the Good Time Emporium in Somerville, Massachusetts prior to its close at the end of the month. The ""Night of Champions"" supercard included MWF Heavyweight Champion Todd Hanson successfully defending his title against Abyss, Rick Fuller and Executioner Milonas in a Monster's Ball match. in the main event. The undercard featured a lumberjack match between MWF Television Champion Tommaso Ciampa and Jay Lethal, MWF Tag Team Champions The Canadian Superstars against Beau Douglas and a mystery partner. The event also had the debut of Homicide and the return of Chris Sabin. This was followed by a VIP Q&A session and an autograph/photo fanfest with Abyss, Jay Lethal, Homicide, Chris Sabin and Leticia Cline as well as a special appearance by MWF President John Cena, Sr. and the Iron Sheik. The promotion also held a raffle in which the winner would receive a free lunch with the Iron Sheik. The event was originally scheduled to be held on March 29, however the promotion was forced to reschedule the event when Total Nonstop Action Wrestling needed Jay Lethal, Chris Sabin and Homicide for an additional television taping of "TNA Impact!" during WrestleMania weekend in Orlando, Florida.
Controversy.
Iron Sheik.
A regular on the independent circuit since the early 1990s, the Iron Sheik became associated with the MWF soon after its establishment and was later named the MWF Lt. Commissioner. On August 5, 2005, the Iron Sheik, Dan Mirade and MWF Commissioner Dr. Brad Von Johnson were involved in a serious car accident when they were hit head on by a drunk driver following an event, "Iron Sheik Appreciation Night", in Blackstone, Massachusetts. The Iron Sheik caused a disturbance at the event earlier refusing to sign autographs or to actively participate in the show going on a drug induced episode in the parking lot locking himself in a wrestlers car. The three were later treated at a local hospital and the Iron Sheik later claimed he might never wrestle again.
In November 2004, during an MWF Studio Shoot Interview shoot interview with Dan Mirade, the Iron Sheik went on a tirade when asked about his appearance at WrestleMania III with Nikolai Volkoff and their match against The Killer Bees (B. Brian Blair and Jim Brunzell) making several controversial and derogatory statements in reference to Brian Blair. This interview was later released on a three-hour DVD and has since become popular on websites such as YouTube and led to his appearances on Howard Stern. The video has been seen by over one and a half million fans.
In 2008, the MWF conducted another shoot interview with the Iron Sheik. Similarly released on DVD, the Sheik verbally attacked Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior, making remarks about what he'd do to the Warrior's daughter if she was 18. He later made a Christmas challenge to Kramer, footage from the infamous "Iron Sheik Appreciation Night" and a ""drug induced"" telephone interview. The Sheik was attacked by the MWF Stalker, claiming he had gotten alcohol poisoning when an MWF cameraman had given him beer in his hotel room.
Jim Neidhart.
On December 28, 2001, the promotion held its second live event in Revere, Massachusetts which was to raise money for Butch Miller, better known as Bushwhacker Butch of The Bushwhackers, who was hospitalized from an untreated staph infection. Among those who headlined the show included Road Dogg and ECW wrestlers Little Guido, Super Nova and Chris Chetti. "Tough Enough" finalist Christopher Nowinski also made a surprise appearance.
A few weeks prior to the event, Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart contacted the promotion via e-mail offering to appear at the show. Neidhart also said he would donate an official Hart Foundation leather jacket for the raffle being held. In exchange, the promotion agreed to provide transportation. When the company was unable to afford to fly him in from Calgary, which would cost at least $1,200 (more than the cost of the actual fundraiser), Neidhart offered to sell his frequent flyer miles for $500 which the promotion accepted.
The promotion received no contact from Neidhart after that point and, on the day of the fundraiser, Neidhart did not arrive. According to owner Dan Mirade, he was later told that Neidhart had been planning on coming to Boston to spend Christmas week with a "ring rat". When she decided to spend Christmas with her family down south, Neidhart stayed in Calgary and did not return the money he received from the promotion.
Receiving no response to their e-mail and telephone messages, the promotion posted Neidhart's home phone number on the front page of the MWF website. The promotion, which had gotten a number of replies from fans asking for an explanation for Neidhart's absence, explained that they had not received word from Neidhart and suggested fans to confront Neidhart themselves.
Neidhart got in contact with the promotion soon after this and claimed that he had intended to send the money back, but now refused because they had ""upset him"". Neidhart eventually claimed in a later e-mail that he had sent the $500 to Butch Miller, however this was denied by both Butch Miller and longtime tag team partner Luke Williams. Soon after seeing him on the Raw 15th anniversary show, Dan Mirade wrote about the incident on his website and challenged Neidhart for an explanation however Neidhart has not responded.
Criticism of the professional wrestling industry.
In recent years, Mirade has been increasingly outspoken against both the increasing violence of "hardcore wrestling" as well as steroid and drug abuse which has resulted in the deaths of a high number of professional wrestlers. Dan Mirade also criticized certain ethical standards and business practices, particularly after the ring death of independent wrestler Dan Quirk, advocating some sort of system to regulate the professional wrestling industry.
Tony Rumble Memorial Battle Royal.
The Tony Rumble Memorial Battle Royal is the main event held at the semi-annual memorial show for the late Tony Rumble, a wrestler and longtime wrestling promoter in the New England area throughout the 1990s. Todd Hanson won the first on the November 22, 2003 MWF Ultra program.
The next battle royal was held at the MWF's "Soul Survivor II" and won by Bull Montana, a close friend of Tony Rumble, on November 13, 2004. The third show was co-hosted by the MWF and AWA New England which was won by 72-year-old Ox Baker. This was his first wrestling match in several years. On August 4, 2007, Rick Fuller won the 4th annual Tony Rumble Memorial Battle Royal.

Khoo Thean Teik () was one of the most powerful and notorious Hokkien leaders of 19th-century Penang. His name, "Thean Teik", means "Heavenly Virtue". He was the leader of the Tokong or Khian Teik society that was involved in the Penang Riots of 1867 and through its connection with the Hai San, the internecine Larut Wars of 1861 to 1874. He traded through the companies Khoon Ho and Chin Bee. He was a towkay, trading in immigrant labour and had interests in the Opium Farms in Penang and Hong Kong. Thean Teik Estate, a residential neighbourhood in Penang, is named after him.
Towkay, The Protector of Coolies.
Khoo Thean Teik had the monopoly for indentured migrant workers from China. He was paid a thousand or more dollars a year by parties in Shantou to be a Khehtau or Towkay or Protector of Coolies.
Chung Keng Quee and Khoo Thean Teik.
Chung Keng Quee and Khoo Thean Teik were connected both politically and commercially, the politics of the day being commercially motivated in any case. Apart from the monopolies for tobacco, liquor, opium and gambling revenue farming in Perak that these two jointly obtained from Sir Hugh Low, British Resident at Perak in 1889, they were both heads of their respective secret societies which were allied against their common foe, the Ghee Hin. While Chung, Keng Quee was head of the Hai San his ally Khoo, Thean Teik was head of the Tua Pek Kong or Kien Tek Society. Chung, Keng Quee and Khoo Thean Teik together represented the allied Haisan-Khianteik group of Perak Hakkas and Penang Hockiens. 
Both Chung and Khoo were in the business of procuring, supplying or employing coolies. Khoo Thean Teik aided by Koh, Seang Thye on one occasion supplied $60,000 in goods, money and ammunition to Chung, Keng Quee and Tan, Yit Hoon for their mining activities and for their military activities against the Ghee Hin in return for seven-tenths of the percentage of the tin they produced.

Matthew Joseph Minch (1857 – 5 June 1921) was an Irish nationalist politician from County Kildare who sat in the United Kingdom House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Kildare from 1892 to 1903.
Minch was first elected at the 1892 general election as an Anti-Parnellite candidate, unseating the sitting Parnellite MP James Leahy. He was re-elected unopposed in 1895 and also in 1900, on the latter occasion as an Irish Parliamentary Party candidate, since the split in the party had been resolved earlier that year. He resigned his seat on 12 May 1903, by the procedural device of taking the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead.
Minch was also one of the first councillors elected to Kildare County Council, when it was created in 1899.
He died at his residence, Rockfield House, Athy, County Kildare, in 1921.

Wax Poetics

Wax Poetics is a bimonthly American music magazine dedicated to vintage and contemporary jazz, funk, soul, Latin, hip-hop, reggae, blues, and R&B in the crate-digger tradition; the name of the magazine is itself an allusion to vinyl records.
Since the first issue of "Wax Poetics" was published in December 2001, the magazine has expanded its operations to include apparel sales, a record label, a music download site, book publishing and film divisions, and a weekly radio show on New York City's East Village Radio hosted by the magazine's staff.
In November 2008, Wax Poetics, Inc. unveiled "Wax Poetics Japan".
History.
In spring 2001, Editor-In-Chief Andre Torres was living in New York City and conducting preliminary research for a documentary on die-hard record collectors when he realized there were no publications to consult devoted to the culture of beat-digging. He scrapped the documentary and, instead, decided to start his own quarterly to fill what he perceived to be gaps in the landscape of contemporary music magazines.
"No one was even touching jazz, soul, funk, or anything like that", Torres said in a March 2008 interview with Current TV. "What I was trying to do was essentially look at hip-hop through that lens."
Torres enlisted the help of Brian DiGenti, a close friend with editorial experience as a freelance writer. Both Torres and DiGenti had graduated from the University of Florida in 1995—Torres with a degree in painting and DiGenti with a degree in English. Although they had met at school, they didn't begin to develop a friendship until they had both moved to New York City in the late 1990s. There, they often made beats and went mining for vinyl together, further cultivating a common fascination with the crate-digging lifestyle. DiGenti had moved to California about a year before Torres called about the start-up, but agreed to co-found the publication across the country.
For a year, DiGenti and Creative Director Kevin DeBernardi, then a partner in the fledgling quarterly, collaborated to create a mock-up of "Wax Poetics". In December 2001, Torres, DiGenti, and DeBernardi independently published the first issue, which cost $6 USD and featured stories on Bobbito, Scotty Hard, Idris Muhammad, Charles Mingus, and Madlib. The magazine continues to be independently published.
Starting with "Issue 2", Torres began to incorporate a one-page editor's letter to preface the magazine's content.
With "Issue 15", published in February 2006, "Wax Poetics" transitioned from a quarterly to bimonthly magazine.
As of September 2011, forty-eight issues of the magazine have been published. In terms of physical size, the magazine is a 7x10-inch publication in the vein of National Geographic. It has grown from 81 pages in its first issue to 130 pages on average. Aside from regular contributions from editors, the magazine has no staff writers and relies exclusively on freelance work.
According to a 2009 press manual released by Wax Poetics, Inc. readership has also grown exponentially. Today, there are approximately three readers to each issue, making for a total audience of 232,200. About 92% of "Wax Poetics" readership lies within the United States, mostly in Mid-Atlantic and Pacific states. Ninety-seven percent of readers claim to collect their issues, according to a "Wax Poetics" reader survey conducted in June 2008.
Torres' manifesto was not only to shed light on funk, soul, and jazz, but to illuminate the symbiotic and historical relationship between those genres and contemporary hip-hop. "Wax Poetics" regularly features seminal artists like Victor Axelrod or Bob James, unveiling the stories behind the people and music that have provided both a cultural framework for hip-hop to evolve, and the sonic backbone for crucial elements like breakbeat.
"We dibble-dabble in the new and the old", Torres told Current TV. "Young people come to this older music; it's through hip-hop. It's hearing someone sample something and saying, "Oh, yo, I gotta find that record that Primo or Dr. Dre or whoever used on that track. It's like a time-machine. You use hip-hop to travel back and pick up on everything that's happened before."
Since "Issue 4", every issue of the magazine features a "re:Discovery", or a brief article that revisits a noteworthy vintage record. Recent issues include upwards of five re:Discovery blurbs, each accompanied by a full-color photograph of the record itself or its original cover.
Aesthetically, the magazine has been hailed by the New York Times Style Magazine as, "The best and most exquisitely laid-out music bimonthly in America" Starting with "Issue 19", "Wax Poetics" regularly began to feature a different artist on the front and back covers of the magazine; prior to this design change, both covers typically featured artwork or non-specific vintage photographs.
"I wanted to create something that, when you finished reading it, there would be no way that you would ever think about putting it in the trash", Torres told Current TV.
In 2007, Wax Poetics, Inc. expanded to include a book publishing division and a record label.
Wax Poetics Books has since released three coffee table anthologies, including two collections of notable past articles, published in response to demand for back issues. The manifesto of Wax Poetics Records is to reissue rare LPs, 12-inches, and 7-inches.
In summer 2008, the company also launched an online music store—"Wax Poetics Digital"—where customers can purchase performance-quality mp3s of music featured in the magazine.
In 2011, Wax Poetics, Inc. received an Utne Reader Independent Press Award for Arts Coverage.
In 2013, early trailers for the film "Dead Man Down" featured a cover of Pink Floyd's "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" performed by Wax Poetics Records artist Kendra Morris.

Hook gauge evaporimeter

A Hook gauge evaporimeter is a precision instrument used to measure changes in water levels due to evaporation. It is used 
to precisely measure the level of a free water surface as an evaporation pan or a tank. The main users are meteorologists and water engineers, especially in hot, arid countries where water conservation is of vital importance.
Description.
The device consists of a sharp hook suspended from a micrometer cylinder, with the body of the device having arms which rest on the rim of a still well inside the pan. The still well serves to isolate the device from any ripples that might be present in the sample being measured, while allowing the water level to equalize. The measurement is taken by turning the knob to lower the hook through the surface of the water until capillary action causes a small depression to form around the tip of the hook. The knob is then turned slowly until the depression "pops," with the measurement showing on the micrometer scale.
Use.
Evaporation rate is determined by a sequence of measurements over a set time interval, usually every 24 hours.

being rotated off axis instead of in line. In the case of bearings, run-out will cause vibration as well as increased loads on the bearings themselves.
Run-out is dynamic and cannot be compensated. If a rotating component, such as a drill chuck, does not hold the drill centrally then as 
it rotates the rotating drill will turn about a secondary axis.
Run-out has two main forms:
Radial run-out is caused by the tool or component being rotated off centre, i.e. the tool or component axis does not correspond with the main 
axis. Radial run-out will measure the same all along the main axis.
Axial run-out is caused by the tool or component being at an angle to the axis. Axial run-out causes the tip of the tool (or shaft) rotate 
off centre relative to the base. Axial run-out will vary according to how far from the base it is measured.
In addition, irregular run-out is the result of worn or rough bearings which can manifest itself as either axial or radial run-out.
Runout will be present in any rotating system and, depending on the system, the different forms may either combine increasing total runout, or cancel 
reducing total runout. At any point along a tool or shaft it is not possible to determine whether runout is axial or radial, only by 
measuring along the axis can they be differentiated.
Absolute alignment is not possible, a degree of error will always be present.
Radial run-out.
Radial run-out is the result of a rotating component running off centre, such as a ball bearing with an offset centre. This means that the rotating tool or shaft, instead of being centrally aligned, will rotate about a secondary axis. In general, cutting tools are more tolerant of radial 
run-out since the edges are parallel to the line of cutting tending to keep the tool tip aligned. However, a rotating shaft may be 
less tolerant of radial run-out since the centre of gravity is displaced by the amount of run-out.
Axial run-out.
Axial run-out is the result of a rotating component not being parallel with the axis, such as a drill chuck not holding the drill exactly in line with the axis. In general, cutting tools are less 
tolerant of axial run-out since the tool tip tends to dig in and increase run-out. However a shaft may be more tolerant of axial run-out 
since the centre of gravity is displaced less.
Measurement.
Typically run-out is measured using a dial indicator pressed against the rotating component while it is turned. Total indicated run-out 
(TIR) is a technician's term for the measured run-out of any rotating system, including all forms of run-out, at the measured point.

Dávid Gróf

Dávid Gróf (born 17 April 1989) is a Hungarian footballer currently on trial with Clermont, who plays as a goalkeeper. Gróf started his senior career with Scottish club Hibernian, making one appearance during the 2008–09 season before being released from his contract. He subsequently played in England for Notts County, Tamworth, Mansfield Town and Walsall.
Career.
Hibernian.
Gróf started his professional career with Hibernian, making his professional debut in their 4–3 defeat by Greenock Morton in the Scottish League Cup on 26 August 2008.
Later that season, Gróf was convicted of a drink driving offence and was consequently banned from driving for two years. Hibs also disciplined the player, who made a public apology through the club's website. He was relegated to the status of fourth choice goalkeeper at Hibs after the arrival of Grzegorz Szamotulski during January 2009. Gróf went on trial at West Bromwich Albion, but was released by Hibs towards the end of the 2008–09 season, despite having 18 months left on his contract.
Following his release by Hibs, Gróf trained with English League Two side Gillingham, featuring in a reserve team match against Lewes.
Notts County.
Gróf went on trial with League One club Notts County in July 2010. He agreed a deal to sign for the club, subject to medical. On the same day as the deal with Notts County was announced, Gróf played for Tamworth in a friendly match against Aberdeen. He completed the move on 26 July. On 4 August 2010 it was confirmed that Gróf would be joining The Lambs on a one month loan deal in time for the new season. Just six days later Gróf was recalled by his parent club.
Gróf signed on loan with Conference National club Mansfield Town on 31 January 2011. Grof played an integral part in Mansfield's FA Trophy run which saw the Stags lose to Darlington in the final at Wembley on 7 May. Despite not being permitted to play in the final itself, Grof became a hero to the Mansfield fans due to his performances in both the FA Trophy and the Conference National, and appeared before the game against Darlington to a standing ovation from the 6,000-strong travelling Mansfield fans.
Despite rave reviews of his performances at Mansfield, Grof was waived by Notts County at the end of the season alongside defender Graeme Lee..
Walsall.
Following a trial spell, Gróf signed a one year contract with Football League One side Walsall in July 2011. Gróf made his full Walsall debut against Bournemouth, keeping a cleen sheet in a 2-0 win, and then made his home debut the following game—a Football League Trophy first round fixture against Shrewsbury Town, which Walsall won 2-1.. On 17 March 2013, Gróf announced that he was moving to France to pursue a career away from the Saddlers, having fallen down the pecking order at Walsall behind a string of successive loan goalkeepers manager Dean Smith had signed due to his poor early season form.
Clermont.
On 18 March 2013, Gróf began his trial with Clermont, successfully completing the first part of his medical and training with the first team later that day.
Personal life.
Gróf's father Attila also played professionally as a goalkeeper, for Vasas Budapest, Újpesti Dózsa, Videoton, Honvéd and Hungary.
Gróf was convicted of a drink driving offence and banned from driving for two years. He was charged with another drink driving offence in April 2009.

Black Deep

The Black Deep is a channel which forms the most important of the three main permanent shipping routes past the shoals in the North Sea and outer Thames Estuary, the others being the Barrow Deep and Princes Channel.
The Black Deep begins in open sea east of Foulness Point and south of Clacton-on-Sea and is bounded by two substantial sandbanks, the Sunk Sands to the north-west and the Long Sands spread out to the south and east (which have some wind turbines). 
Deep-draught vessels making for the Port of London use it to approach (from the north-east from the position of the Sunk lightship thence into the Knock John channel to enter the Thames Estuary. Bulk carriers also tend to use the channel when entering or exiting the Medway estuary to the south that has a minimum depth of 14 metres as far as Kingsnorth.
Nautical markers.
Deep-draught vessels making for the Port of London from the North Sea use it to approach (from the north-east from the position of the Sunk lightship thence into the Knock John channel to enter the Thames. 
Passing south off the West Knock lightship off Shoeburyness large bulk carriers also tend to use the channel when entering or exiting the Medway estuary that has a minimum depth of 14 metres as far as Kingsnorth. 
History.
The Thames Estuary was historically a difficult area to navigate due to its many sandbanks. One of the earliest references to maritime pilotage dates from 1387 and refers to a pilot "of the Black Deeps" in the estuary. Richard Caundish, the sixteenth-century maker of the oldest known English maritime chart, who had charted the Thames shoals, was assisted by a pilot who had found a new, safer route through the Black Deep.
As a strategically important area, access to the Deep has been restricted in wartime, while during the Second World War naval forts were constructed at Sunk Head and Knock John to deter German minelaying activity. Until 1967 sewage sludge from the City of London was dumped in the Black Deep at a point around below London Bridge; after this time the Barrow Deep was used.
A rumour current in the sixteenth century, repeated by the chroniclers John Rastell and Edward Hall, by a continuer of John Hardyng's chronicle and subsequently by John Speed, suggested that Richard III, aided by the priest of Sir Robert Brackenbury, had disposed of the bodies of the murdered Edward V of England and Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York in the Black Deep, "whereby they should never rise up, or be any more seen".
Through much of the 1980s, Knock John Deep was the anchorage spot for Radio Carolines Ross Revenge ship
The London Array wind farm is sited immediately to the east of the Deep.

Albania–Kosovo relations

Albanian–Kosovan relations are foreign relations between Albania and the Republic of Kosovo. Albania has an embassy in Pristina and the Republic of Kosovo has an embassy in Tirana. There are two million Albanians living in Kosovo (93% of Kosovo's population) and Albanian is the official language of Kosovo.
History of relations before Kosovo's Independence.
In 1992, Albania was the only country which, by a parliament decision, recognized the Republic of Kosova, proclaimed independent one year earlier, in 1991, although official support was limited to such declaration; in addition, in 1994, when the Bosnian conflict escalated Albania made a step back by recognizing Yugoslavia's borders, which were inclusive of Kosovo.
Political relations.
When Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, Albania became one of the first countries to officially announce its recognition of the sovereign Republic of Kosovo, which is recognised today by out of () United Nations (UN) member states. On 18 August 2009, Prime Minister Sali Berisha of Albania was quoted saying that "There should be no customs administration between the two countries. We should by no means allow Albania and Kosovo to view each other as foreign countries", provoking an outrage in Serbia. The Albanian Foreign Ministry in a clarification note to Serbia said: "Albania considers the independent state of Kosova as a factor of peace and stability in the Balkan region, whereas its independence is considered as a clear step serving people, stability and European perspective of the region". The Albanian Foreign Ministry also said that the foreign policy of the Republic of Albania" is based on common objectives of Euro-Atlantic integration of the country, Republic of Kosova and entire region".
Cultural relations.
In October 2011 an agreement was reached between the Ministry of Culture of Kosovo and that of Albania on the common use of embassies and consulary services, whereas in May 2012 a common primer for the 2012-13 academic year of first class students was approved by both governments.
Economic relations.
The Albanian Konfindustria threw first the idea of an Albanian regional market in 2008, whereas the idea about a common economic space between Albania and Kosovo was seminated by Kosovo government officials in 2011. They were reinforced especially by Behgjet Pacolli in some of his speeches in Albania: Pacolli claimed that the economic union would increase competition towards the EU. Pacolli's ideas were endorsed by the Party for Justice, Integration and Unity.

Intersection form (4-manifold)

In mathematics, the intersection form of an oriented compact 4-manifold is a special symmetric bilinear form on the 2nd cohomology group of the 4-manifold. It reflects much of the topology of the 4-manifolds, including information on the existence of a smooth structure.
Definition.
The intersection form
is given by
When the 4-manifold is also smooth, then in de Rham cohomology, if "a" and "b" are represented by 2-forms α and β, then the intersection form can be expressed by the integral
where formula_4 is the wedge product, see exterior algebra.
Poincaré duality.
Poincaré duality allows a geometric definition of the intersection form. If the Poincaré duals of "a" and "b" are represented by surfaces (or 2-cycles) "A" and "B" meeting transversely, then each intersection point has a multipicity +1 or −1 depending on the orientations, and "Q""M"("a", "b") is the sum of these multiplicities.
Thus the intersection form can also be thought of as a pairing on the 2nd homology group. Poincare duality also implies that the form is unimodular (up to torsion).
Properties and applications.
By Wu's formula, a spin 4-manifold must have even intersection form, i.e. "Q"("x","x") is even for every "x". For a simply-connected 4-manifold (or more generally one with no 2-torsion residing in the first homology), the converse holds. 
The signature of the intersection form is an important invariant. A 4-manifold bounds a 5-manifold if and only if it has zero signature. Van der Blij's lemma implies that a spin 4-manifold has signature a multiple of eight. In fact, Rokhlin's theorem implies that a smooth compact spin 4-manifold has signature a multiple of 16.
Michael Freedman used the intersection form to classify simply-connected topological 4-manifolds. Given any unimodular symmetric bilinear form over the integers, "Q", there is a simply-connected closed 4-manifold "M" with intersection form "Q". If "Q" is even, there is only one such manifold. If "Q" is odd, there are two, with at least one (possibly both) having no smooth structure. Thus two simply-connected closed "smooth" 4-manifolds with the same intersection form are homeomorphic. In the odd case, the two manifolds are distinguished by their Kirby–Siebenmann invariant.
Donaldson's theorem states a "smooth" simply-connected 4-manifold with positive definite intersection form has the diagonal (scalar 1) intersection form. So Freedman's classification implies there are many non-smoothable 4-manifolds, for example the E8 manifold.
Non-orientable manifolds.
Just as there is a version of Poincare duality for Z/2Z coefficients, there is also a version of the intersection form with Z/2Z coefficients, taking values in Z/2Z rather than in Z. In this way non-orientable manifolds get an intersection form as well. Of course one does not see any of this in de Rham cohomology.

Gylfi Sigurðsson

Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson (born 8 September 1989) is an Icelandic footballer who currently plays for Tottenham as a midfielder. He is a specialist on set-pieces and possesses great long-range shooting ability. He was voted player of the season for two consecutive seasons for Reading in 2009-10 season and for Hoffenheim in 2010-11
Club career.
Early life.
Born in Hafnarfjörður, Iceland, Gylfi played for hometown side FH before joining Breiðablik and was an Icelandic under-17 international. He had spent time on trial with Preston North End before signing for Reading on an Academy scholarship on 1 October 2005. He spent three years playing for the youth and reserve teams. Prior to the 2007–08 season, he and five other youngsters were given professional contracts.
2008–09.
Ahead of the 2008–09 season, Gylfi was assigned the number 34 shirt for Reading, and he was an unused substitute in the club's 2–1 away win at Dagenham & Redbridge in August 2008. Two weeks later, he made his debut in Reading's League Cup match against Luton Town, coming on as a 59th minute substitute. He scored a penalty in Reading's penalty shoot-out against Stoke City in the League Cup, after coming on as a substitute. In order to gain first-team experience, Gylfi signed for Shrewsbury Town on a one-month loan spell, and he scored on his league debut against Bournemouth in October 2008. He made a total of six appearances during his time at Shrewsbury, scoring one goal. He returned to his parent club and featured in Reading's 2–0 loss to Cardiff City in the FA Cup. In February 2009, Gylfi joined Crewe Alexandra on an emergency loan move, and he made his debut two days later against Brighton away, scoring in the 89th minute in Crewe's 4–0 win. In March 2009, Gylfi's loan was extended until the end of the season. He scored two further goals for Crewe, against Milton Keynes Dons and Cheltenham Town respectively, but could not prevent the club's relegation to League Two.
2009–10.
Gylfi scored his first Reading goal against Burton Albion from 35 yards out in the first round League Cup tie at home on 11 August 2009. He scored his first league goal for Reading in a 3–2 defeat at Peterborough United on 19 September 2009. Gylfi was a huge contributor in Reading's extraordinary 2009–10 FA Cup run which included wins over Premier League sides Liverpool and Burnley and West Bromwich Albion. Perhaps his biggest goal to date came against Liverpool in the third round of the FA Cup on 13 January 2010, when he scored a penalty in injury time to make the score 1–1 and force extra time. Reading went on to win the game 2–1. He scored the winning goal in the 87th minute against Burnley in the fourth round. In the fifth round, he scored the winning goal against West Bromwich Albion for a 3–2 victory in extra time. In April 2010, Gylfi won the Championship Player of the Month Award for March, beating Peter Løvenkrands of Newcastle United, Graham Dorrans of West Brom and Adel Taarabt of QPR, scoring five goals in six games in that month. Gylfi scored against Preston North End in the final game of the season. Before the match, Gylfi was named as the 2009–10 Reading Player of the Season beating Jimmy Kébé and Ryan Bertrand, who finished second and third respectively.
Gylfi finished the season with a fruitful 21 goals in 44 matches in all competitions. His performances and his young age prompted several Premier League clubs to enquire over his availability, but he committed his future to Reading when he signed a three-year deal in May 2010.
2010–11.
Gylfi scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in the first match of the season when he "skipped past two players before smashing in a 25-yard equaliser" against Scunthorpe in a 2–1 home loss. He followed this up on 28 August with a short range chip in the 22nd minute away at Leicester. The evening after the game the Icelandic media reported that Gylfi was to travel to Germany the following Monday to have a medical at 1899 Hoffenheim. Gylfi joined 1899 Hoffenheim on 31 August 2010. Reading reported that the fee exceeded their previous club record sale of £6.5 million recouped from the sale of Kevin Doyle.
1899 Hoffenheim.
Gylfi made his debut for 1899 Hoffenheim on 10 September 2010, coming on with 10 minutes to go in a 2–0 win over Schalke. A week later, he scored his first goal for Hoffenheim in a 2–2 draw with Kaiserslautern after coming on as a 77th minute substitute. He scored with his first touch, a 20 yard free kick that levelled the game. His second goal for the club was another free kick, from 25 yards, against Mainz in a 4–2 away defeat. He added another two goals to his tally in Hoffenheim's home win against Hannover 96, one of which was from the penalty spot.
On 25 May 2011, Gylfi was voted as 1899 Hoffenheim's fans' player of the season, despite only starting 13 games. He finished the season with ten goals and two assists. During the first half of the 2011–12 season, he fell down the pecking order, making just seven league appearances and was linked with a move away from the club.
Swansea City loan.
On 1 January 2012, it was announced that Gylfi would join Premier League club Swansea City on loan for the rest of the season.
He made his Premier League debut for Swansea on 15 January, coming on at half-time and setting up the winning goal in a 3–2 win over Arsenal.
On 4 February, Gylfi scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 win against West Brom. He also created Swansea's other goal game for Danny Graham, taking his tally to three assists in four games. On 3 March, he scored two goals in a 2–0 victory away at Wigan, his second being a free kick. Two weeks later, he scored another brace in a 3-0 away win against Fulham.
He scored his next goal at White Hart Lane in his team's 3–1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 1 April.
As a result of his fine form, Gylfi was named the Premier League Player of the Month for March, the first Icelander to win the award. His next goal came in a 3–0 victory over Blackburn Rovers that put the club on 42 points for the season.
On 28 May, Swansea agreed a £6.8 million fee with Hoffenheim for the permanent transfer of the player, subject to him passing a medical, however, following Brendan Rodgers' move to Liverpool, the deal collapsed despite Huw Jenkins keeping hope in the deal alight. In 18 Premier League games during his loan spell for Swansea, Sigurðsson scored seven goals and added four assists.
Tottenham Hotspur.
On 4 July 2012, it was confirmed that Gylfi had joined Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £8.8 million. He was the first signing for newly appointed Head Coach, André Villas-Boas. He scored his first goal for the club in a friendly against Stevenage, after coming on as a second half substitute. On 31 July, Gylfi scored the winning goal in a friendly against New York Red Bulls. On 26 September, Gylfi scored his first goal for the club in a third round League Cup tie away against Carlisle, closing the scoring in a 3–0 win.
Brian McDermott confirmed that Reading made three unsuccessful bids to bring Gylfi back to his former club during the January 2013 transfer window, including a club record offer on deadline day thought by BBC Sport to be around £10 million. On 25 February, Gylfi scored his first Premier League goal for Tottenham which was the second goal in a 3-2 win against West Ham United. In the following game, a 2-1 win against Arsenal, he provided the assist for Gareth Bale.
In the 2013-14 season, he scored a brace in 2-0 win against Norwich City on September 14, 2013. This win took Spurs up to second in the table. Sigurðsson's momentum in Tottenham's team continued on 28 September 2013, as he scored in a 1–1 home draw against Chelsea.
International career.
Gylfi took part in the 2008 U19 European Championship qualifying, scoring twice in qualification and twice in the elite round, but Iceland lost out to group winners Bulgaria by three points and missed out on the finals. In November 2007, Gylfi made his U21s debut for Iceland, playing half an hour against Germany. He made his first appearance in the 2009 European Under-21 Championship qualifying four days later, coming as an extra-time substitute, and played in the remaining matches. In Iceland's last match, he scored the opener against Slovakia but Miroslav Stoch equalised to make it 1–1. Iceland failed to qualify for the play-offs but made a bright start to the 2011 campaign. He made his campaign debut in October against San Marino and made an immediate impact, scoring a brace within 16 minutes in a 6–0 thrashing. In May 2010, Gylfi made his full Iceland debut in the convincing 4–0 win over Andorra and provided the assist for the second goal from a free kick. Gylfi also helped Iceland's U21 side reach the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, playing in both play-off legs against Scotland U21s as Iceland won 4–2 on aggregate. In the second leg, Gylfi scored two "stunning" second-half goals to ensure Iceland won the match 2–1.
Business interests.
Despite claiming to be "not into fishing", Gylfi became the chairman of a fishing company in Flateyri called 'Lotna ehf' in 2011. Lotna ehf's boats catch lumpfish, cod, wolffish and plaice and Gylfi's chairmanship makes him a prominent member of the Icelandic fishing industry.

Face Off!

Face Off! is an hockey game developed by Mindspan Technologies and published by GameStar on 1989. The game's features include not only the ability to play with your chosen hockey player, but also game plans, team maneuvers and management.
Gameplay.
The game offers play with single player mode, two humans in cooperative mode or in versus mode. The player can control only one hockey player at a time, that can only be changed during interruptions of play. You can choose to play with 1, 3 or 5 players on each team.
The aspects that made this game famous were the change of camera angle if the hockey player shoots and it's close to goalkeeper, and the mini-fightgame scenario during the match that occurs sometimes when a player commits a foul on an opposite team's member.
Reception.
Stephen Bradley of "Amiga Format" called "Face-Off" "a competent, if uninspiring game of three periods". David Slingsby of "CU Amiga" said, "Fans of the sport should stick with old Amiga fave, "Blades of Steel", or buy a Megadrive and play EA's "Ice Hockey" game".

Cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence

The cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence or CAPS method is a technique in molecular biology for the analysis of genetic markers. It is an extension to the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) method, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to more quickly analyse the results.
Like RFLP, CAPS works on the principle that genetic differences between individuals can create or abolish restriction endonuclease restriction sites, and that these differences can be detected in the resulting DNA fragment length after digestion. 
In the CAPS method, PCR amplification is directed across the altered restriction site, and the products digested with the restriction enzyme. When fractionated by agarose or acrylamide gel electrophoresis, the digested PCR products will give readily distinguishable patterns of bands. Alternatively, the amplified segment can by analyzed by Allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes, a process that can often be done by a simple Dot blot.

Nunawading Football Club

Nunawading Football Club is an Australian rules football club located 20 km east of Melbourne in the suburb of Blackburn North, Victoria. Nunawading Football Club colours are Black, White & Steel, with a Titan emblem and black shorts and are affiliated with the Eastern Football League.
Historically the club was known as the lions and had the colours of maroon & gold.
Timeline of the Nunawading Titans Football Club.
"Nunawading Football Club" was first used in 1894, when the Mitcham, Box Hill and Surrey Hills Football Clubs merged to play in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (now the Victorian Amateur Football Association). The three teams were struggling to field sides at that time and joined together for two seasons, before going their separate ways again in 1896. Surrey Hills however, continued to use the Nunawading title until 1907. 
The current Nunawading Football Club was established in 1927 as the Tunstall Football Club. Home games were played at the Nunawading Recreation Reserve in Silver Grove. The club played in the Box Hill Reporter District Football Association before moving to the Ringwood District Football League in 1928 and remaining until 1932. From 1933 until 1961 the club played in the Eastern Suburbs Football League. The first premiership was won in 1938 in B Grade. In 1943, the suburb of Tunstall changed its name to Nunawading and the club soon followed. The second premiership was won in 1955, also in B Grade. 
In 1962 the club affiliated with the newly established Eastern District Football League as a foundation member. By 1974 the club moved to Mahoneys Reserve in Forest Hill, as the Nunawading Recreation centre was being built. Finally, in 1996 the decision was made to move to Koonung Park in Springfield Road, Blackburn North as there were no social facilities at Mahoneys Reserve. During this period the only premiership success were the 1962 (Under 16), 1976 (Under 17) and 1987 (Reserves). 
After a lean period which included five successive wooden spoons, the club recovered somewhat in 2001, to narrowly miss the finals by percentage.
In 2002, the club achieved its first senior premiership in forty seven years, defeating Heathmont by ninety three points in Fourth Division and promotion to Third Division.
Third Division
2003-2008
The club finished seventh in the first two seasons before improving to fifth and missing out on percentage.
2006 saw the Seniors play finals after defeating Waverley Blues in the First Semi lost to the eventual premier South Croydon by twelve points in the Preliminary Final.
The Reserves won the premiership by three points.
2007 the Seniors lost to Upper Ferntree Gully in the First Semi.
2008 the Seniors finished 2nd on the table after home and away but lost both Finals.
The Reserves won the Grand Final defeating Mooroolbark by sixty one points.
Unfortunately on the eve of the 2010 season, Nunawading were forced to request a demotion back to Division Four. This request was granted with Kilsyth taking their place in Division Three.

Independent software verification and validation

ISVV activities are performed by independent engineering teams, not involved in the software development process, to assess the processes and the resulting products. The ISVV team independency is performed at three different levels: financial, managerial and technical.
ISVV goes far beyond “traditional” verification and validation techniques, applied by development teams. While the latter aim to ensure that the software performs well against the nominal requirements, ISVV is focused on non-functional requirements such as robustness and reliability, and on conditions that can lead the software to fail. ISVV results and findings are fed back to the development teams for correction and improvement.
ISVV History.
ISVV derives from the application of IV&V (Independent Verification and Validation) to the software. Early ISVV application (as known today) dates back to the early 1970s when the U.S. Army sponsored the first significant program related to IV&V for the Safeguard Anti-Ballistic Missile System.
By the end of the 1970s IV&V was rapidly becoming popular. The constant increase in complexity, size and importance of the software lead to an increasing demand on IV&V applied to software (ISVV).
Meanwhile IV&V (and ISVV for software systems) gets consolidated and is now widely used by organisations such as the DoD, FAA, NASA and ESA. IV&V is mentioned in [ISO/IEC 12207 and formalised in 1012.
Initially in 2004-2005, a European consortium led by the European Space Agency, and composed by DNV(N), Critical Software SA(P), Terma(DK) and CODA Scisys(UK) created the first version of a guide devoted to ISVV, called "ESA Guide for Independent Verification and Validation" with support from other organizations, e.g. SoftWcare SL (E) (), etc. 
In 2008 the European Space Agency released a second version, being SoftWcare SL was the supporting editor having received inputs from many different European Space ISVV stakeholders. This guide covers the methodologies applicable to all the software engineering phases in what concerns ISVV.
ISVV Methodology.
ISVV is usually composed by five principal phases, these phases can be executed sequentially or as results of a tailoring process.

2011 FIBA Asia Championship

The 2011 FIBA Asia Championship for Men is the intercontinental championship for basketball organized by FIBA Asia that doubles as a qualifying tournament for the men's basketball tournament of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, United Kingdom. The tournament was held in 15–25 September 2011 at Wuhan, Hubei, China. Lebanon was the original host for the event. Team China won the tournament, defeating Jordan 70–69 in the final. It was the first time in the history of FIBA Asia Championship that the title was won by just one single point.
Qualification.
According to the FIBA Asia rules, each zone had two berths, and the host nation China and FIBA Asia Stanković Cup champions Lebanon were automatically qualified. The other four places are allocated to the zones according to performance in the 2010 FIBA Asia Stanković Cup. Therefore, with Lebanon, Japan, Qatar and the Philippines finishing in the top four in that tournament, West Asia, East Asia, the Gulf and Southeast Asia were all given one additional qualifying berth per zone.
Among qualified teams from 2009, Sri Lanka did not qualify in the tournament, while Kazakhstan and Kuwait did not participate. The three returning teams are Bahrain, which qualified in 2009 but withdrew, Syria which did not participate in 2009, and Malaysia which last participated in 2005.
Draw.
The draw was held on July 6 at Wuhan. The four semifinalists of the 2010 FIBA Asia Stanković Cup of the last year were seeded into four different groups, and the draw decided which group each of them will figure. Then one Middle Asia was drawn into Group A, the other Middle Asia into B, Indonesia and United Arab Emirates into C and D. The next four were Malaysia, Chinese Taipei, Syria and Bahrain in order. Finally, hosts China chose Group D, after which Iran, Jordan and Korea were drawn into Group B, C, A, respectively.
The following is the distribution of the pots prior the draw, with teams sorted by their FIBA World Ranking (Bahrain is unranked); teams from each pot cannot be drawn together.
Venues.
Two arenas in Wuhan, Wuhan Gymnasium and Hongshan Gymnasium, were used in the championship. Wuhan Gymnasium was the primary venue.

The Message Trust

The Message Trust is an award-winning Christian charity working to improve the lives of young people in Greater Manchester, UK and beyond through the Eden Network.
Working in schools, in local communities and in prisons, The Message is in contact with around 100,000 young people each year.
The Message was founded by well-known speaker, author and current chief executive, Andy Hawthorne OBE.
History.
The history of The Message is told in Andy Hawthorne’s books, "The Message 20 - Celebrating Two Decades of Changed Lives" and "Diary of a Dangerous Vision" 
Message 88 and 89.
The Message Trust has its roots in a week-long youth event that took place at the Manchester Apollo in 1988, Message '88. 
Founder and current CEO Andy Hawthorne together with his businessman brother Simon felt stirred to present the Christian gospel message relevantly to the young people of Manchester and organised a week of mission gigs at the Apollo. Message ‘88 attracted over 20,000 young people to hear live performances by bands and artists and a presentation of the gospel message.
A repeat run in 1989 attracted similar numbers and led to the brothers being approached by a member of one of the bands involved about forming a full-time youth mission to schools.
‘Message to Schools’ was the result, formed with the express purpose of taking the gospel to young people in schools through hip hop and dance music.
Schools work.
A band was formed to run the schools weeks, dubbed the World Wide Message Tribe, later shortened to simply The Tribe. Demand for the band to play in schools and further afield quickly increased and the Tribe went on to record successful albums which brought international recognition and critical acclaim.
The Tribe disbanded in 2004, but The Message's schools work has multiplied with new bands, LZ7, BlushUK (until 2010), Twelve24 and MaLoKai, and theatre company In Yer Face working in high schools in and around the Greater Manchester area. Several new teams, including a street dance crew, are currently in development.
Eden Network.
Continuing the sharp focus on Manchester, and particularly the toughest areas and estates of the city, Andy Hawthorne and team began to have a vision to see Christians moving into these areas to live and work, supporting local churches particularly to reach young people. This initiative was named Eden, and the first Eden partnership was launched in 1997 in Benchill, Wythenshawe, at that time the most deprived neighbourhood in the UK. Others followed and today there are 23 active partnerships in key areas of urban challenge in Greater Manchester, London, the North East, Yorkshire, the Humber region and Merseyside. The history and philosophy behind Eden is explained in Matt Wilson's books "Eden: Called to the Streets" and "Concrete Faith". In 2009, the Eden Network was formed with the aim of spreading the Eden vision to other urban areas across the UK.
Eden Bus.
An Eden Bus ministry was launched in early 2000, to extend The Message’s reach into local communities. Two mobile youth centres, fully equipped with state-of-the-art technology and staffed by committed volunteers, visit some of Manchester’s most deprived neighbourhoods, working with around 500 young people a week.
Message 2000 and Festival:Manchester.
In the summer of 2000, The Message partnered with another Christian youth charity, Soul Survivor, to run an ambitious city-wide youth mission, Message 2000.
Around 10,000 young Christian volunteers worked in partnership with Greater Manchester churches on social, environmental and crime reduction projects. 
The project was hailed as a success, not least because during the 10 days of work in one estate, Swinton Valley, there were no recorded incidence of crime. Since the summer of 2000, police have reported a sustained reduction in crime.
In the summer of 2003, The Message partnered with the Luis Palau Evangelistic Association, to put on another week-long city-wide venture, Festival:Manchester.
Over 5,000 young people got involved in a total of 317 local community projects, many in association with the Greater Manchester Police.
Around 55,000 people from across Manchester attended the open-air festival that took place in Heaton Park the following weekend, featuring Luis Palau, and performances from The Tribe, Michael Tait and TobyMac.
'Words and action' evangelism.
The model of ‘words and action’ evangelism which characterised both Message 2000 and Festival:Manchester continued in the ‘Big Deal’, ‘Hope 08’ and 'Shine Your Light' initiatives. Supported by police, schools and councillors, Big Deal and Hope 08 brought together local communities to deliver social action and community-building projects in the ten boroughs that make up Greater Manchester. These range from environmental clean-ups, painting, car washes, barbecues, children’s activities, fun days and youth concerts. In 2010, The Message launched a national campaign to spread the model of 'words and action' evangelism further, challenging young people to complete 15 specific acts of kindness in their local communities during the summer of 2010.
Reflex.
Reflex is The Message's ministry in prisons across the North West of England. Originally started as a partnership with Youth For Christ, Reflex works mainly with young offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 but also works with juvenile offenders aged 17 and under.
Their work spans first-contact detached work on the prison wings through to help with resettlement back into the community in conjunction with the Message Enterprise Centre (see below).
Message Academy.
The Message Academy (formerly Genetik) is an annual gap-year programme for young people aged 17 and over who wish to train in Christian mission and youth work. Over 400 young leaders were trained by The Message between 2001 and 2012. The Message Academy course runs over 10 months and involves placements in The Message's community-based Eden projects. Students choose from three specialist 'tracks' – Creative, Urban or Worship – which have attracted guest tutors including Matt Redman.
Urban Hero Awards.
July 2008 saw the first annual Urban Hero Awards at which young people are honoured for notable achievements, often against the odds. The Awards have been repeated each year since, with winners from all over England emerging from Eden projects in Yorkshire to the Message Academy (Genetik) programme in Manchester. The Urban Hero Awards 2012 took place at Old Trafford Cricket Ground with 800 guests including Lord Bob Edmiston and Sir Brian Souter (Stagecoach).
Message Enterprise Centre.
In January 2013, the charity opened the Message Enterprise Centre, a new business and training hub for young people in the region. Building on The Message's track record for mentoring young men and women from disadvantaged communities and those leaving custody, the Centre has created several new businesses which employee ex-offenders. As of February 2013, these include a café, a hair & beauty salon, a cycle recycling shop and property maintenance and development businesses.
Twentieth anniversary in 2012.
In November 2012, The Message Trust celebrated 20 years as a charitable trust with the release of a hardback book and an accompanying CD, documenting the journey so far in words, pictures and music. It also contains 20 of the most striking stories of transformation from the first two decades. New stories are regularly published on the charity's website, every four months in the charity's Flow magazine, and monthly on its "Flow Podcast".
Future plans.
In 2013, The Message announced plans to continue to grow its work among young people in schools, communities and prisons along three main strands: developing existing and adding new creative teams to reach young people in high schools in Greater Manchester and beyond; working with local churches to develop existing and adding new Eden partnerships, bringing life and hope to the more of the toughest communities in the UK and key global cities; and partnering with the Message Enterprise Centre to disciple vulnerable young men and women while in, and once they have left, custody.

Cimbali

Cimbali (with brand name LaCimbali) is an Italian manufacturer of professional espresso and cappuccino equipment.
Overview.
Gruppo Cimbali SpA is based in Binasco, near Milan. It has four production facilities, all located in Italy, which cover a total area of 75,000 m² (800,000 ft²), of which 40,000 m² (430,000 ft²) indoors. With branch offices in France, Spain, the UK and in the United States, the company employs more than 600 people. Today, Cimbali exports roughly 70% of its production through a network of 700 direct sales and service centers to over a hundred countries around the world.
Company history.
Cimbali was established in 1912 by Giuseppe Cimbali in Milan, at Via Caminadella 6. Covering 30 m² to accommodate the owner and his two employees, the first shop ("Cimbali Giuseppe — Copper Plumbing & General Repairs") specialized in the manufacture of copper goods.
In the 1930s, coffee machines produced steam and hot water by burning wood or coal beneath a vertical boiler. They were cylindrical in shape and were therefore called column machines. Cimbali’s first column machine was called the “Rapida”.
The positive post-war atmosphere in Italy brought an increase in the consumption of coffee, thus further driving the development of the company's operations. As a result, the market demanded machines with enhanced productivity. In 1945, Cimbali’s “Albadoro” model featured two independent vertical boilers. Modular in design, the “Albadoro“ was made available in 3 to 6 brew groups. The “Albadoro” was the first machine to feature an integrated cup warmer.
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, boilers powered by electric heating elements began to replace wood and coal heated boilers. Moreover, it was during this period that lever machines radically changed the way of extracting coffee. This new technique forced water through coffee at a pressure of 9 atmospheres, thus obtaining a high-efficiency extraction of the aroma, and ultimately the crema caffè.
In 1955, the company introduced the “Granluce”, the first coffee machine to feature a hydraulic group. Patented by Cimbali in 1956, the hydraulic group signaled a transformation within the professional espresso machine industry. The new hydraulic group and its dosed delivery represented the first important step towards automation. 1959 saw the arrival of a model with the application of a heat exchanger, which was later to become an essential constructional element, ensuring the thermal balance of the machine.
In 1962, with the cooperation of the famous Italian designers, Castiglioni, Cimbali created a product of extraordinary modern design: the “Pitagora”. The “Pitagora” abandoned the redundant shapes typical of the machines of the period and adopted essential, clean lines. Stainless steel was used for the first time, along with color and screen printing. The result was revolutionary, gaining Cimbali a prestigious industrial design award, the Compasso d’Oro.
Designed in 1969 for the foodservice industry, Cimbali’s “Superbar” was cutting edge for completely automated solutions.
At the beginning of the 1970s, product design became characterized by an approach which was more closely linked to an industrial process. The body of the M15, designed by Bonetto, was made of only 6 main structural elements. Alongside the hydraulic and lever groups there was also a direct injection group equipped with an external pump.
In the 1990s, Cimbali integrated a microprocessor to the “Dosatron” in order to better govern the main functions of the machine.
In 1992, Cimbali introduced the “Dolcevita”, a family of fully automatic espresso machines targeting in-cup consistency and beverage quality. Designed by Salvemini, the “Dolcevita” played a significant role in Cimbali’s growth outside Italy in non-conventional markets new to espresso coffee.
In 1995, Cimbali purchased its leading Italian competitor, Faema.
Certifications and social responsibility.
Cimbali has certified its factory production processes according to ISO 9001 standards. Its products are accredited by major international organizations including TUV and UL. Furthermore they comply with the most rigorous international hygiene and sanitation authorities including NSF and ETL. The Cimbali product range is RoHS compliant. Moreover, the company is in process of certifying its environmental management system to ISO 14001 standards.

Abergil crime family

The Abergil crime family () is a crime organization based in Israel, and located around the world, founded by Ya'akov Abergil. The group was headed by Ya'akov Abergil () until his death in 2002, and is now run under the auspices of Itzhak (Itzik) Abergil (), and his brothers Meir Abergil () and Avraham (Ibi) Abergil (). Its illicit activities include drug trafficking, both in Israel and the US, murder, extortion, embezzlement, money laundering, the control of illegal casinos and other crimes. Considered one of the six major organized-crime cells in Israel, and one of the world’s top 40 biggest drug importers to the United States, the Abergils have been arrested and detained multiple times worldwide. 
Avraham Abergil is currently incarcerated on a slew of drug and attempted murder charges.
On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil and three associates were extradited to the United States. In a 77-page 32-count indictment filed on July 13, 2008 at federal court in Los Angeles, the Abergil family is considered one of the most powerful crime families in Israel, deriving that power, in part, “because of its propensity for violence in Israel and around the world.” They were charged with murder, laundering millions of dollars obtained from embezzlement at Israel Trade Bank, extortion of business people, and operating an ecstasy-distribution network for millions of ecstasy pills. The Abergils and their three associates have denied all charges. According to Israeli police sources, their crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after their extradition. 
In August 2011, Meir Abergil returned to Israel after a California court had approved a plea agreement setting him free. In May 2012, Itzhak Abergil was sentenced by a Los Angeles federal court to 10 years in prison with credit for time served, after pleading guilty to being part of a racketeering enterprise that distributed Ecstasy and whose members killed a man for stealing a large drug shipment. He is to serve the remaining eight and a half years time in Israel. 
Operations.
Assets.
According to the Israeli Police, the Abergil crime family, at its height in June 2004, had tens of millions of shekels in assets in Israel. The organization ran 37 companies, owned 48 apartments and 56 cars. 
Money-laundering.
According to the indictment, the crime organization headed by Itzhak and Meir Abergil ran a flourishing money-laundering business in the US from 2002 to 2006, processing tens of millions of dollars of funds embezzled from the Israel Trade Bank, through the “Jerusalem Gang′s” extortion of Ofer Maximov, that led to his sister Etti Alon′s embezzling 250 million shekel. The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the United States, who were later extorted to give up their businesses if they did not pay up. Meir Abergil, described as the person in charge of finances, collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it. Gabi Ben Harosh of the “Jerusalem Gang” who was arrested in Los Angeles in 2004, ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance. Sasson Barashi of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money. Yoram Elal, who has fled to Brazil, was responsible for special-operations. The activities have been documented in hundreds of surveillance reports, photographs and phone calls, which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment.
Drug trafficking.
The US State Department considers the Abergils as one of the world’s top 40 drug importers to the US. US federal prosecutors claim that when the Abergils wished to expand their mob syndicate in the US, they turned for help to an upstart Latino street gang known as the Vineland Boyz. The Boyz' feud with the Mexican Mafia, known as "La Eme", sent the Boyz looking for a new source of drugs, which the Israelis provided. The Abergils, along with Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, are also charged with smuggling cocaine and hashish from Europe to the United States. 
On July 22, 2002, the Los Angeles Police busted a meeting of ecstasy dealers in the midst of a drug and money exchange, confiscating over 400,000 tablets of the drug, valued at more than $5 million. According to the LAPD, Moshe Malul was the person behind the distribution of millions of ecstasy tablets in Southern California and Itzhak Abergil the person responsible for the ecstasy shipments from Belgium and Holland.
In May 2008, a court in Antwerp, Belgium sentenced Itzhak Abergil along with eight other accomplices to a firm 5-year prison term for his involvement in large scale drug trafficking through the city of Antwerp′s port. 
Personal safety.
In June 2002 Yaakov Abergil, the eldest of the brothers was murdered in front of his family. After his death, the leadership passed on to his brother Itzhak, who has accumulated a number of powerful enemies and survived several assassination attempts. In December 2002, one of Abergil's main rivals, underworld kingpin Ze'ev Rosenstein, was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to assassinate both Abergils. In 2007, Police learned that at least two contract killers, believed to be from the Commonwealth of Independent States, had come to Israel at the behest of a rival crime family embroiled in a vendetta with the Abergil crime syndicate. The police believed the two hit men to be hired by the competing Alperon crime family.
Murders and assassinations.
The Abergils have been accused of number of murders and assassinations.
On August 31, 2003, Sami Atias, an Israeli drug dealer who had belonged to an ecstasy ring headed by Abergil and Moshe Malul, was shot at close range and killed in the parking lot of an Encino café as he was getting into his car. Allegedly he had tried to steal 76 kilograms of Ecstasy in 2002. According to the indictment, Moshe Malul and fugitive Vineland Boyz′ member Luis Sandoval, were at the scene when Atias was shot, but another man had pulled the trigger. Itzhak Abergil had offered to help with the slaying during a meeting in Spain, but he did not play a direct role in the killing.
On October 5, 2008, Amir Sanker and Eitan Gerella, two suspected associates of the Abergil crime family, were acquitted of a charge of grievous bodily harm by a Tel Aviv District Court, instead being convicted of lesser crimes, due to police negligence in collecting evidence. The charge sheet had claimed that the suspects had planned to kill Nissim Alperon, brother of crime boss Yaakov Alperon in retaliation for an attack on Itzhak Abergil said to be carried out by the Alperons five months earlier. On November 2008, Yaakov Alperon was killed in a car blast in Tel Aviv.
In 2005, two girls were killed in Ramle by shots fired at a hall where Itzhak Abergil was celebrating. Police believe the slain girls were innocent victims of a mistake by the attacker in identifying his true target.
In August 2008 31 year-old social worker Margarita Lautin (), from Yehud, was killed while dining on the Bat Yam boardwalk with her husband and two young children. The targets of the shooting, attempting to run away from the shooters, had created a clear line of fire on Lautin, who was shot in the chest. The two suspected assassins, Ronen Ben-Adi and Shimon Sabah, members of the Abergil mob, fled the scene on a motorcycle, but were later apprehended by the police. They were convicted in May 2010, Sabah was sentenced to prison for seven years, and Ben Adi to life in prison and required to pay Lautin's daughters NIS 350,000 in compensation. 
The assailants were apparently targeting Rami Amira, who was sitting at a table nearby with Moti Hassin and Simantov Hatayeb, who are all identified with the Abergil group, in an effort to resolve an internal dispute. Amira sustained a slight injury in his cheek as a result of the attack. He was killed on 2 February 2011 in Rishon Letzion, presumably by the Abergil organization which, according to police sources, continued to operate while the two Abergil brothers were extradited and awaiting trial in the United States. 
Arrests and extradition.
In 2004, Gabi Ben Harosh, partner of the Abergil brothers, was arrested in Los Angeles. After two years of house arrest, he signed a plea bargain for minor offenses, connected to bringing in foreign currency without a permit, and was sentenced to community service and judicial supervision for three years. In view of the Abergil brothers extradition to the US, he and his wife were arrested for violating immigration laws. It is believed that American authorities tried to apply pressure to Ben Harosh to incriminate the Abergil brothers but failed. 
Hai Vaknin, called an “Abergil henchman” by the Israeli daily "Haaretz", was arrested in the USA in 2006. In January 2011, he signed a plea bargain, confessing to money laundering and receiving a 57-month jail sentence, which he had already served, and was ordered to serve three years under supervised release. His description of loans and extortion practices was expected to help convict Itzhak and Meir Abergil.
In early August 2008, Itzhak and Meir Abergil were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murder of Margarita Lautin who had died after being mistakenly shot during a failed assassination attempt by members of the Abergil mob.
On August 26, 2008 Itzhak and Meir Abergil along with Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa were brought before a Jerusalem Magistrate′s Court judge for their alleged role in the killing of Israeli drug dealer Sami Atias in Encino in August 2003, as a revenge for his allegedly having stolen money from them. They were remanded in custody together with Sason Barashi as a result of a request by law enforcement in the United States for their extradition. The indictment includes four different crimes that are attributed to Yitzhak Abergil: involvement together with Malul in the murder of Atias in California in 2003, trade in Ecstasy, extortion and violence against businessmen, and money laundering and fraud. The inquiry into the case had lasted for six years, involving the FBI, tax authorities and law enforcement officials in more than ten countries in America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. 
In July 2009, a Jerusalem District Court approved the state’s request to extradite the Abergils, Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa to the US. In December 2010, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the three associates of the Abergil brothers. 
On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil, together with Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, were extradited to the US, arriving in Los Angeles on January 13, aboard an American government airplane. They were being held in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. If convicted, they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under the terms of the extradition agreement, they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, a threatening letter was found under the car of the wife of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition.
Despite evidence, Itzhak Abergil called the allegations “police provocation” during an earlier custody hearing, further stating that he had never been to the United States. In an interview on Israeli Television, Meir Abergil dismissed claims that he and his brother were important criminals, saying: “Who are we? We're peanuts compared to the mafias they have in America [...] Who are we? Nothing, cockroaches.”
After the extradition.
According to Israeli police sources, the Abergil crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after Itzhak Abergil and his brother Meir were arrested. The Israeli Police reportedly believe that Moti Hassin, a reputed senior member of the Abergil group, took the reins of the organization after the Abergil brothers were extradited to the US. In March 2012, Hassin and three alleged accomplices were arrested on suspicion of being responsible for two gangland hits carried out in the Tel Aviv area, the killings of Avi David, who was shot dead at point-blank range by a motorcyclist outside a Bat Yam steakhouse in October 2011, and Itzik Geffen, who died in a hail of gunfire at a gas station in Holon two months later. In February 2013, the police arrested three men suspected of taking part in the murder of Sharon Mizrachi, who was shot to death while sitting in his car in Bat Yam. According to the police, the main motive for the killings was the victim's intention to join a rival crime gang, and were ordered by Hassin partly to establish his position as the new leader of the crime family. 
In early May 2012, five alleged members of the Abergil organization who were suspected of conspiring to commit a crime and possessing deadly weapons were arrested in Jerusalem, after police had found a weapons cache inside a storage room in an apartment building in Jerusalem where one of the suspects's parents live. According to the suspects, they followed the advice of Itzhak Abergil to hide weapons in public buildings in order to deflect suspicion from the organization. At the suspects’ homes police discovered signs of violence, including ceramic bulletproof vests with bullet holes in them. The police suspects that the organization was planning a major attack. According to the suspects, they were planning to take revenge on a Jerusalem resident, who owed the organization money.
Plea agreements.
In August 2011, Meir Abergil was freed and returned to Israel after having served about three years in prison first in Israel and then in the United States. Charged with blackmailing U.S. businessmen to whom the brothers had lent money, he allegedly had played a relatively minor role in the crimes and is thought to have been involved mainly in the extortion of Asi Vaknin, who was arrested in Mexico and brought to the United States in April 2011, but refuses to testify against the Abergils. As a result, U.S. authorities reportedly were not able to built a case against Meir Abergil, leading to a plea agreement approved by a California court in which Abergil confessed to extortion of over a million dollars from another mob figure. In Israel, he faces criminal charges pending against him in the district court in Petah Tikva over allegations regarding his involvement in an Internet gambling business set up about 10 years ago which operated in many locations in Israel, including Internet cafes, convenience stores, soccer lottery outlets and nightclubs functioning as casinos. According to his lawyer, Abergil′s involvement in the alleged activities was marginal.
In May 2012, Itzhak Abergil pleaded guilty in a Los Angeles federal court to being part of a racketeering enterprise that distributed Ecstasy and whose members killed Sami Atias for stealing a large drug shipment. On May 21, 2012 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, including the length of his detention in the US, leaving eight and a half years for him to serve. He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from prison. His lawyers called it "a good deal," according to them, Abergil was facing the risk of getting a life sentence. He is to serve his time in Israel.
Moshe Malul pleaded guilty to a charge of racketeering conspiracy, admitting to conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to import the drug Ecstasy to the U.S. In his plea agreement, he acknowledged that as part of the Abergil crime family, he hired members of the Vineland Boyz street gang based in North Hollywood, to kill Sami Atias in retaliation for stealing Ecstasy that belonged to the Abergil organization. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison on June 21, 2012 with credit for time served. He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison.
Israel Ozifa pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to import Ecstasy pills from Belgium into the United States. He was sentenced to eight years in federal prison on July 18, 2012 with credit for time served. He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison. According to the prosecution, Ozifa was an "important, trusted and, most important, productive member" of the organization, while Ozifa's attorney said his client was "really the running dog" of the Abergil family and only followed orders. 
On January 8, 2013 Sasson Barashy was found guilty of racketeering conspiracy and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with credit for time served. He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison.

Mueller Community

Mueller is a Planned Unit Development (PUD) in the northeast-central portion of the city of Austin, Texas, USA. The project is in the process of long-term development on the former site of the Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, which was closed in 1999 upon the opening of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in southeast Austin, itself a civilian adaptation of Bergstrom Air Force Base after its closure in the early 1990s. Mueller is intended to be a pedestrian-oriented, interactive mixed-use community, and a model for responsible urban planning and development.
The community is being developed by Catellus, whose parent company was ProLogis. Per the developer, the value of the Mueller development upon completion will be $1.3 billion, and will comprise 4.2 million square feet of non-residential development, 650,000 sqaure feet of retail space, 4,600 homes, and 140 acres of open space. An estimated 10,000 permanent jobs within the development will have been created by the time it is complete.
The Mueller Master Plan includes a mix of residential, commercial and retail developments, along with designated parks and green space, with many of the elements completed and many more in the planning stages. On Mueller's northwest edge, bordering I-35, the Mueller Retail Center has been completed, and is anchored by The Home Depot, Best Buy, Old Navy, and PetSmart. Adjacent to it is the Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas, a 32-acre campus with 170 patient beds and a total of 1,400 employees. In keeping with Mueller's best-practices ethos regarding environmentally friendly development, the Center is the first acute-care facility in the world to achieve LEED Platinum certification. Its 30-room Ronald McDonald House serves patients from both within the Dell facility as well as other children's hospitals in the region. The Center was expanded in 2011 to add a new patient wing.
To the Dell Center's immediate north, the 14-acre University of Texas Health Research Campus is under development. Its first building, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute, is already open, and next door a Residence Inn by Marriott is scheduled to open in early 2014. East of the Research Campus is a new Performing Arts Center designed to serve the entire Austin Independent School District. Upon completion in late 2014, it will incorporate a 1,200-seat auditorium as well as a 250-person capacity "black box theater." In Mueller's north-center area, at the intersection of East 51st St. and Berkman Drive, the Mueller Market District made its debut in mid-2013, anchored by a state-of-the-art H-E-B Grocery Store. The 83,000 square foot store was designed to consume a full 80% less electricity than a standard grocery store, as well as 50% less water, and H-E-B officials plan to seek LEED Silver Certification for the project. The store features Cafe Mueller, which includes a stage for band performances; dedicated stations for making guacamole and sushi on-site; two recharging stations for electric vehicles; and the only gas station in Central Austin that sells ethanol-based E85 car fuel.
A number of other facilities have been completed inside Mueller as well. The Austin Children's Museum -- rebranded as The Thinkery -- and Austin Playhouse were among the first tenants of the Mueller Town Center, and a 279-unit AMLI apartment community is under construction next door. It will join two already completed luxury apartment complexes inside Mueller: [http://www.mosaicaustin.com/austin-tx-apartments.asp Mosaic and Elements. Finally, Wildflower Terrace -- an upscale apartment community, with 201 units, for seniors 65 and up -- is open and located at Mueller's southern edge, near the intersection of Berkman Drive and Manor Road.
In December 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded Pecan Street, Inc. $10.4 Million in federal stimulus funds to develop an advanced smart grid demonstration project at Mueller, which included a demonstration house -- known as the Pike Powers Commercialization Lab -- that made its debut in 2013.
Numerous eco-friendly green spaces have debuted in Mueller as well. At the center of it all is Lake Park, a 30-acre landscape featuring a duck-filled lake, hike and bike trails, and Browning Hangar, a historic airport hangar originally constructed in the 1940s and retroconverted into an open-air amphitheater. The Hangar currently houses Mueller's weekly Sunday Farmers' Market, and is periodically used for special events as well. Next door to the Hangar is Mueller Central, a former airport administration building that now houses an information center for Mueller as a whole. A block away from Mueller Central and Lake Park, Mueller's Northwest Greenway meanders its way along the area's border all the way to its termination point at I-35. South of Lake Park is the Southwest Greenway, where native plants and outdoor art installations share space with walking trails and water features. Here, Mueller officials have partnered with the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center on a restoration project for the endangered Blackland Prairie. Finally, Ella Wooten Neighborhood Park is a three-acre green space located roughly in the center of Mueller's residential section. It houses a Junior Olympic-sized swimming pool, open seasonally, as well as a playscape and basketball court.
Builders.
, there were six residential builders participating in the development of the area, David Weekley Homes, Meritage Homes Corporation, Standard Pacific Homes, Streetman Homes, Saldaña Homes, and Muskin Homes. As of 2012, Homes By Avi were added as the shop house builder.
Affordability.
Approximately 25% of the planned residential homes are to be part of the Mueller Affordable Program, available under a shared equity or fixed appreciation scheme (fixed appreciation was implemented during July of 2012 and applies to all affordable housing entered into subsequent to the implementation date). The affordable program has a purchase component which is available to households earning less than 80% of the city's mean family income (MFI), and a rental program available to those earning less than 60% of the Austin MFI. 
Community.
Members of the Mueller community launched the Mueller Neighborhood Association to foment strong ties among neighbors, as well as awareness of new developments in the area. The development also has its own custom social networking site powered by a proprietary system called citiCite (Mueller citiCite Page). Other neighborhood social tools include a closed Mueller Neighbors Facebook group and the POA-sponsored community Web site.
Education.
Residents are zoned to the Austin Independent School District. The first half of the community is zoned to Maplewood Elementary School, Kealing Middle School, and McCallum High School, although Reagan High School is only 1.5 miles away from the development.

France–Kosovo relations

French–Kosovan relations refer to the bilateral relations between France and the Republic of Kosovo. When Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 17 February 2008, France became one of the first countries to announce officially about recognition of sovereign Kosovo. France has an embassy in Pristina. Kosovo has an embassy in Paris.
Political relations.
For many years, France has played an important role in finding a solution to the issue of Kosovo's status. Accordingly, French Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Bernard Kouchner was the first "UN Special Representative of the Secretary General for Kosovo" when the United Nations took over from Serbia in June 1999 in administration of the territory. This involvement, both civilian and military, has continued ever since, promoting democratisation, compliance with the rights of all communities and especially the Serbian community, now very much a minority, and a European rapprochement. France's presence has remained quite considerable within UNMIK and KFOR, with more than 2,000 soldiers out of a total of 16,000 (i.e. the second-largest contingent).
From a political standpoint, as a member of the Contact Group, France has played a key role in the negotiations on Kosovo's status and, within the European Union, to reach a consensus on the deployment of the EULEX mission. Mr. Bernard Kouchner has been very involved in the search for an agreement, relaying the actions of the French President, who had proposed during the G8 summit in July 2008 designating the troika tasked with restarting a final phase of negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina in August 2007. In particular, the minister went to the two parties in July 2007, before receiving his Serbian counterpart and the Kosovan negotiation team (President, Prime Minister and heads of the main parties) in Paris in November, to encourage them to compromise.
Learning a lesson from the impossibility of reaching a negotiated solution, France recognised Kosovo's independence on 18 February.
France intends to pursue its actions promoting stability in the Balkans and the development of Kosovo. The French KFOR contingent, tasked with the country's security, will be maintained. KFOR is led by French General Xavier Bout de Marnhac until September 2008. France will send a large contingent of police officers, judges, judicial experts, and prison and customs staff to the EULEX mission, which will be led by one of its compatriots, Mr. Yves de Kermabon. Finally, France will continue its involvement in the International Steering Group, tasked with watching over the implementation of the provisions of the Ahtisaari plan.
Military.
France participated in the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which resulted in a UN administration of Kosovo and then to eventual independence. France currently has 1,368 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO led Kosovo Force. Originally there was 7,000 French troops in KFOR. Marcel Valentin was the 6th KFOR Commander from 3 October 2001 - 4 October 2002. Yves de Kermabon was the 9th KFOR Commander from 1 September 2004 - 1 September 2005. Also Xavier de Marnhac was the 12th KFOR Commander from 31 August 2007 - 29 August 2008.

Emanuel Gregers

Emanuel Gregers (28 December 1881–22 March 1957) was a Danish actor, screenwriter and film director. Gregers made 36 films during a career which extended during four decades from the Danish golden age of silent film until 1949. Critics often dismissed his work as dependable yet uninspired, however many of his light-hearted comedies achieved great popularity in Denmark. Gregers most notable films were romantic comedies starring his wives Bodil Ipsen and Marguerite Viby.
Career.
Emanuel Gregers was born on 28 December 1881 in Horsens, Denmark. At 16-years-old Gregers debuted at the Horsens summer theater and performed in local theaters for the next 10 years. Around 1909, he moved to Copenhagen and performed in the larger theaters including Norrebros Teater and the Betty Nansen Teatret. Although he quickly shifted to working in film in 1912, Gregers maintained a lifelong attachment to stagework: he owned the Casino theater in Copenhagen and managed it from 1921 to 1931, then continued as a stage director into the 1940s.
In 1912, Gregers debuted on screen with Olaf Fønss in the silent film "Bryggerens datter" ("The Brewer's Daughter") written by Carl Th. Dreyer. The following year he began work with the Filmfabriken studio, where he performed in another Dreyer story "Krigskorrespondenter" ("The War Correspondent"), and became the studio's upcoming star. But by 1914, Gregers interest had shifted to working behind the camera. He directed himself in a couple of smaller films, then moved to Nordisk Film where he devoted his full attention to writing and directing. In the early 1920s, Gregers directed a series of films with his wife at the time Bodil Ipsen in the role. Most notable was the melodramatic crime story "Lavinen", in which Greger's employed an elaborate flash-back structure to relate how the lead character's past leads to a murder. It was also at this time that Gregers was part of Nordisk Film's push for larger films based on literary works. In 1920, Greger's filmed "Den flyvende Hollænder" ("The Flying Dutchman") based on the 1839 novel "The Phantom Ship" and, in 1922, he made "Den sidste af Slægten" ("The Last of the Family Tree") based upon a novel by the later Nazi writer Edvard Nielsen-Stevns. For the later film, Gregers ran into trouble with Danish censors. In the climatic ending the villain, a depraved artist, falls to his death from scaffolding inside a church. The censors objected and removed the ending.
Gregers eventually directed 36 films. The most notable were his folk comedies: the wacky 1937 romantic comedy "Mille, Marie of mig" ("Milly, Maria and Me"), in which his then current wife, Marguerite Viby, and the most popular Danish comedienne of the 30's, played three roles ; 1938's "Bolettes brudeafærd" ("Bolettes Bridal Party"), which starred his former wife Bodil Ipsen as a sharp-tongued spinster; the witty period comedy "Sørensen og Rasmussen" which starred both his former wives, Viby and Ipsen; and the 1941 backstage musical, "Alle gaar rundt og forelsker sig" ("Everyone's Falling in Love") -- in which a small part was played by Greger's next wife, Ruth Saabye.
Gregers directed his final film in 1949. He died 22 March 1957 at the age of 75.
Personal life.
Gregers was married five times, all with actresses with whom he worked. He married the first time in 1907 with Ella Olsen. His second marriage to Bodil Ipsen lasted three years from 1919 to 1923. After divorcing Ipsen, he immediately married Kiss Gregers (born Karen Oda Andersen). His fourth marriage was with the Danish comic actress Marguerite Viby (who also was married five times). Their marriage lasted from 1932 to 1938. His final marriage was with Ruth Egede Saabye who played minor roles in Greger's films in the early 1940s.

Gary David

Gary David (born July 13, 1978) is a Filipino professional basketball player who currently plays for the Meralco Bolts of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He is a three-time All-star and co-holds the longest streak for consecutive games recording 20 points or more. Famously known as El Granada, he is widely hailed by fans, legends, and hall of famers as one of the best scorers of all-time in the PBA.
Collegiate and Amateur career.
David started out as an intramural player at the Lyceum of the Philippines University, the same school he later powered to three runner-up finishes in the NCRAA versus a star-studded St. Francis of Assisi team led by behemoth brothers Yancy and Ranidel de Ocampo.
From Lyceum, he joined the Montaña Pawnshop Jewelers in the Philippine Basketball League, winning an MVP award in 2003.
International career.
After winning the MVP plum in 2003 in the PBL, David was chosen to be part of the Philippine team that would compete in the 2003 Southeast Asian Games, starring alongside college rival Ranidel De Ocampo, University of the East star James Yap, Ateneo de Manila's Rich Alvarez, and PSBA's Marc Pingris. They won the tournament and brought home the gold medal.
David was then chosen to be part of the Smart Gilas Pilipinas 2.0 that would be build to compete for the 2014 World Championships. In August 2012, the national team competed in its first international tournament, the 2012 William Jones Cup. In the team's third assignment, they faced long time rival South Korea. David bailed out the Nationals, who squandered a 14-point lead before trailing by 12, with two clutch baskets in a row to propel the Philippines to a 3-0 start. They then beat Japan in the next game thanks to a rally that was started by David after hitting a three-pointer after being down by nine. After losing to Lebanon, David helped the Nationals beat 3-time defending champions Iran, 77-75 in thrilling fashion. He then lead the Nationals along with LA Tenorio, to win the gold medal in the 2012 Jones Cup after beating the USA select team, 76-75. It was the country’s first championship in the Asian level since the Philippine Centennial Team anchored by coach Tim Cone ruled the 1998 edition of the Jones Cup.
"Correct as of 11 August 2013."
Professional career.
Rookie season.
David entered the 2004 PBA Draft, and was selected as the tenth overall pick by the then-Coca-Cola Tigers. The Tigers, headed by then-coach Chot Reyes, were coming of a banner year in which they finished runner-ups in the first and second conference's and winning the 2003 Reinforced Conference title in which Johnny Abarrientos, Rudy Hatfield and Jeffrey Cariaso was still in the fold. During his rookie season, David found himself coming off the bench with insignificant minutes due to the depth of the team. As the season progressed, David played more minutes as the team's sixth man but was then shipped to the Air21 Express in the middle of the season.
Mr. Pure Energy, Multiple Awards & Injury.
Air21's acquisition of David was considered a major steal in the 2005 mid-season. He immediately played significant amount minutes as he backed up then star Ren-Ren Ritualo. David brought high energy to Air21’s running game and was a major factor of the Express bagging the third place finish in the that season's Fiesta conference. David exploded for 19 points to carry the Express to its first-ever Final Four appearance after upsetting the Darvin Ham-led Talk 'N Text Phone Pals, 117–110, in Game 5 of the quarterfinals on January 20, 2006 in Antipolo City.
Throughout the course of the season, David improved his numbers significantly by averaging 21.3 points per game with 4.1 rebounds and 2.4 assists to go as he took the role of being the team's main man. He then got injured causing Air21's semi-finals bid to go down the drain. Despite improving his numbers and collecting numerous awards along the way, David remained an underrated superstar for most of his early years.
Prior to an unfortunate elbow injury, David was having an impressive season and was on the verge of a probable MVP award, only losing in the voting process to eventual winner Willie Miller. He also earned several awards during the season including the PBA Most Improved Player and belonged to the Mythical First Team and the All-Defensive First Team. Despite several injuries in the past, David took the cudgels as the team's go-to-guy after former franchise player Renren Ritualo was shipped to Talk 'N Text and the energetic Ronald Tubid to Ginebra.
In the 2007-08 PBA season, David played only 2 games during the Philippine Cup with limited minutes due to the fact that he was still recovering from a knee injury he suffered the season before. He then came back to full action during the Fiesta Conference but mostly coming of the bench. During the middle of the conference, however, David regained his starting spot and minutes and quickly became the team's go-to-guy along with Arwind Santos. The two lead the Express to 1st place in the elimnination rounf with an 11-7 win-loss slate. The Express received an automatic semi-final berth then they faced the Magnolia Beverage Masters which they won the series 4-2. The Express barge into the Fiesta Conference Finals against the Barangay Ginebra Kings lead by Best Import Chris Alexander and Best Player of the Conference Jayjay Helterbrand along with the tournament's leading scorer Mark Caguioa. The series went down the wire which the eventually lost in seven games. David led the team in scoring again after the season, despite the injury, averaging 16.3 points per game.
David was 100% healthy and back in full force during the 2008-09 PBA season. The Express had a formidable starting lineup with Arwind Santos, Ranidel de Ocampo, Wynne Arboleda and Homer Se in his side, David immediately led the Air21 Express as one of the contenders to win the title. Unfortunately, after trading fellow star Ranidel de Ocampo to the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters, the team only managed to muster 1 win in the next 4 games without de Ocampo. Before the trade, the Express were holding on a 7-6 win-loss record and the an almost guaranteed quarterfinals seat but then went down to the wildcard phase with an 8-10 record. His team finished at a disappointing 8th spot. They faced the Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants during the first round of the wildcard phase which they convincingly won 94-82. However, they eventually lost to the San Miguel Beermen in the second round, 105-86, and failed to booked a quarterfinals seat. He led his team again in scoring during the Philippine Cup with 19.2 points per game including 4.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists.
During the Fiesta Conference, the newly named Burger King Whoppers finished at the number 4 spot and earned a twice-to-beat advantage entering the wildcard phase. They squandered the Alaska Aces, 96-90, and booked a best-of-3 quarterfinals seat against the Sta. Lucia Realtors which they also won, 2-1 and earned a spot in the final four which they were pitted against the no. 1 team San Miguel Beermen. They lost the series 4-2. David, himself, struggled during the semifinals series in which he even scored 0 in game 4, his first ever zero point performance since his rookie season. The Whoppers won third place honors.
Back to Coca-Cola & Struggles.
Before the start of the 2009-10 PBA season, David's tandem partner Arwind Santos, was traded to the San Miguel Beermen in exchange for power forward Marc Pingris and sophomore Ken Bono plus San Miguel's first round pick in the 2010 Draft. Burger King got the first overall pick in the 2010 Draft in which they used to get the 6-foot-9 forward Japeth Aguilar. But shortly after Japeth's PBA Debut, he was then traded to the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters for him to be able to play for the Smart Gilas Pilipinas National Team. David was yet again left alone. Expected to lead his team all by himself, David started slow during the 2009–10 Philippine Cup by only averaging 14.1 points per game and only winning 5 out of 16 games with the Burger King Whoppers. At that point, he was already asking for a trade. On January 4, 2010, he was then traded to the Coca-Cola Tigers for Alex Cabagnot and Wesley Gonzales. Because of their dismal record before David's arrival, Coca-Cola ended up in the wildcard phase. They faced David's former team Burger King Whoppers in the first round of the wildcard and beat 118-112 but were eventually eliminated by the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters after losing, 84-99. He teamed up with Asi Taulava to form a dangeroud duo.
2010 PBA Fiesta Conference was a blast for David as he led the PBA in scoring with 21.9 points per game along with 3.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. The Tigers started out the conference winning four of their first five assignments but shortly after, they suffered a 6-game losing streak that affected their bid for the automatic quarterfinal berth. And due again to the lack of support, his team again wounded up in the wildcard phase with an 8–10 record. They easily beat the Sta. Lucia Realtors, 100-84, to move on to the second phase of the wildcard stage but were met again by the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters. They were eliminated again by the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters, 98-93, and took the final spot in the Quarterfinals. Despite being the league's leading scorer, a poor finish by the team caused David to lose the Best Player of the Conference Award to San Miguel Beermen's Jay Washington.
Coca-Cola/Powerade Tigers.
2010–11 season.
David started strong in the Philippine Cup, averaging a league best 21.5 points while adding 3.3 rebounds and 3.5 assists. However, his team failed to reach the quarterfinals and was eliminated with a dismal 3–11 record, highlighted by an 8-game losing streak.
With only 9 remaining games to be played in the Commissioner's Cup, David quickly got his game going as he led the league again in scoring with an average of 23.5 points along with 3.0 rebounds and 2.6 assists, highlighted by back-to-back 30-point performances, dropping 36 points against the Brgy. Ginebra Kings and 35 points against the San Miguel Beermen. Unfortunately, the Tigers once again failed to reach the playoffs, as they finished in 9th place with a 2–7 record.
In the Governors Cup, David was only able to play 5 games because of an injury. Still, he still managed to produce 19.6 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists. Despite being tied with Rain or Shine and B-Meg after compiling a 4–4 record, Powerade did not make the playoffs as the quotient system did not favor them.
2011–12 season.
In the 2011–12 PBA Philippine Cup, David led his team to 6 wins and 8 losses during eliminations, as Powerade finished 8th to begin the playoffs. The team pulled off a huge upset as they defeated the 1st seeded B-Meg Llamados twice to advance to the next round. This marked the Tigers' first semi-finals appearance in 7 years, the last being in 2004.
During the playoffs, Gary David scored 30 points or more in almost every game. Impressed by David's string of high-scoring games, veteran PBA statistician Fidel Mangonon commented via Facebook: "Since I worked in the PBA starting in late '91 as a sportswriter, Gary David is the 1st local player to score at least 30 pts in 5 straight games." In their next game, David had another 30-point outing as he extended his streak to 6 consecutive games. He was able to anchor his team past the Rain or Shine in the semifinals.
Powerade battled with the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters in the Finals series. Despite the Tropang Texters beating Powerade in 5 games to become back-to-back Philippine Cup champions, David's sterling performance is still regarded as one of the best in PBA playoff/finals history.
David was named the Best Player of the Conference for the PBA Philippine Cup, beating Petron Blaze Boosters' Arwind Santos, despite the latter leading in statistical points. David became just the third player from the Coca Cola franchise to win the plum after Jeffrey Cariaso and Rudy Hatfield. He also became the first and only player from an eighth-seeded team to receive the award.
David tallied averages of 25 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists and a steal per game in the Philippine Cup.
In the early days of February, it was reported that David will be rewarded accordingly by his team, to be given a three-year contract-extension deal worth P15.1 million. Powerade top official JB Baylon has confirmed that they are giving David the maximum monthly pay of P420,000—allowed under the league’s amended salary cap rule. With David's constant improvement came his wage increases. He received P250,000 a month in 2009, P300,000 in 2010 and P350,000 at present.
On 25 March 2012, he became the 64th and latest member of the PBA 5,000-point club, a plateau he reached with his first of two charities at the 3:43 mark of the third period.
Meralco Bolts.
On October 11, 2013, David was traded to the Meralco Bolts with AJ Mandani in exchange for Chris Ross, Chris Timberlake and Meralco's 2016 and 2017 second round picks He made his debut in a Bolts' uniform on November 17 in a losing effort against the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters, 80-89, scoring 26 points and grabbing 7 rebounds.

Crime in Oman

Crime rate in Oman is low compared to industrialized countries. Incidents of serious crime are rare in the country. Incidents of petty crime including burglary and theft of property of foreign tourists are occasionally reported. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) describes the law and order situation in Oman as "generally good". Incidence of street crime is low. Violent crime occurs, but is extremely low compared to the United States.
Oman is a destination point for men and women mainly from South Asian nations like Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan who migrate willingly, but some of whom become victims of trafficking when subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude as domestic workers and laborers. Mistreatment includes non-payment of wages, restrictions on movement and withholding of passports, threats, and physical or sexual abuse. Oman is also a destination point for women trafficked from Asia, Eastern Europe and North Africa for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of the Government of Australia and the FCO reported there are incidents where individuals presenting themselves as employees of the Ministry of Health have called private houses offering vaccinations against avian influenza (commonly known as Bird flu). But the Ministry of Health does not provide any service like this. Drugs are given to people as "vaccines" to make them unconscious and then they are robbed.
Threat of terrorist attack is a matter of concern. The DFAT advised travelers "to exercise a high degree of caution in Oman because of the high threat of terrorist attack". The United States Department of State expressed concern over possibility of terrorist attacks against citizens of the United States. According to the FCO, "there is an underlying threat from terrorism in Oman. Attacks, although unlikely, could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travelers".
Drug trafficking in general is low. However the amount of seized heroin in 1995 was 6.2 kg which was an increase compared to 1 kg in 1994. Oman has established an Inter ministerial committee for the purpose of overseeing drug framework matters. The country has a well organized Drug Control Unit to deal with drug trafficking. Oman is a party of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971).
According to Interpol data, criminal homicide rate in Oman decreased from 0.94 to 0.91 per 100,000 population between 1995 and 2000. It was a decrease of 3.2%. The rate of rape also decreased by 16.4%. But rate of robbery increased by 108.1%. While the rate of robbery was 1.24 per 100,000 population in 1995, it increased to 2.58 per 100,000 population in 2000. Similarly the rate of aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft increased by 10.7%, 57.7%, 317.8% and 112.2% respectively.

Rotax Max Challenge

The Rotax Max Challenge (RMC) is a kart racing series owned and organized worldwide by BRP-Rotax and its distributors, approved and in compliance with CIK-FIA. Competition takes place on a national, international and continental level which culminates in the Grand Finals once a year.
Concept.
The RMC follows a "one-make-engine" formula: only Rotax Max kart engines are allowed. The success in the competition is mainly up to the skills of the driver and that driver's experience in the set up of the engine and the chassis.
Three race classes are recognized for international competition:
Competition at the national level can include additional classes at the discretion of each national RMC. For example, the US RMC includes the following classes:
Authorised distributors of Rotax kart products offer their customers a national RMC programme according to the “Rotax Sporting and Technical Regulations” defined by BRP-Rotax. This results in a fair competition between kart racers that share the same interests.
National Rotax Max Challenge:
International / Continental Rotax Max Challenge competitions:
Out of all national as well as continental and international series, drivers qualify for the annual RMC Grand Finals, which is an invitational race. BRP-Rotax and its partners supply all engines and karts for the event.
RMC Grand Finals.
The Grand Finals of the RMC is an international CIK event. Drivers can qualify for the RMC Grand Final via the national Challenge of their home country and the international RMC. The season's winners of each class of all national RMCs and of the international RMC participate free of cost.
The basic intention of the RMC Grand Finals is to apply the Olympic spirit to an international semi-professional kart racing series. Every year, competitors from more than 50 countries, from five continents, can qualify for the annual Grand Finals of the Rotax Max Challenge.
History.
The first edition of the Grand Finals took place in 2000 on the island of Puerto Rico with 66 drivers representing 19 countries.
In 2001, finalists were invited to the tropical island of Langkawi in Malaysia. That year, 68 drivers from 29 countries compete for the RMC "world champion" title.
South Africa hosted the Grand Finals in 2002, on a track just outside Pretoria. Drivers from 33 different nations were vying for the gold.
In 2003, the Rotax Max Challenge Grand Finals moved to Egypt. That year, the Junior category was introduced. It was also the company's first time cooperating with a chassis manufacturer in order to supply comparable karts to the competitors. The Junior category raced on a 'single make' chassis supplied by CRG while the seniors raced on their private chassis. This move increased the number of participants to almost 100, representing close to 40 different countries.
The volcanic island of Lanzarote in Spain welcomed the 5th Grand Finals in 2004. That event saw for the first time all competitors racing on supplied 'single make' chassis provided by CRG for the Junior category and by BRP-Rotax for the Senior category. Another milestone was the first use by the senior category of the Rotax RM1 chassis with the new 2-speed shifter engine–the 125 MAX DD2.
The Grand Finals returned to Malaysia in 2005. This time, BRP-Rotax presented an even larger event by running three categories: Junior MAX, Senior MAX and the RM1 shifter (now DD2). The event attracted 140 drivers from 43 nations.
Viana do Castelo in Portugal was the host of the 2006 edition of the RMC Grand Finals and reached a record 186 participants from about 50 countries.
In 2007, the 8th RMC Grand Finals took place at the Al Ain Raceway, a modern and brand new kart racing facility in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates operated by Pro Motorsports / Al Ain Sportplex.
In 2008, the racing event moved to the track of La Conca–Muro Leccese, Italy, with 216 drivers. La Conca is one the best karting facilities on earth, located 80 km south of Brindisi and close to the city of Otranto in the beautiful region of Apulia.
The 2009 edition took place in December on the desert track of Ghibli Raceway Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. For 2010 the event is heading towards the south of Italy again. At this event the first time 252 drivers will participate as a new category the 125 DD2 MASTERS was added, which is a category for the +32 years old.

Pseudopelletierine

Pseudopelletierine is an alkaloid derived from the bark of the pomegranate tree. It is a homolog of tropinone, and can be synthesized in a manner analogous to the classical Robinson tropinone synthesis, using glutaraldehyde (rather than succinaldehyde), acetonedicarboxylic acid, and methylammonium chloride.

<doc id="19057920" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19057920" title="Articular cartilage damage">
Articular cartilage damage

Cartilage structures and functions can be damaged. Such damage can result from a variety of causes, such as a bad fall or traumatic sport-accident, previous knee injuries or wear and tear over time. Immobilization for long periods can also result in cartilage damage.
Articular cartilage damage in the knee may be found on its own but it will more often be found in conjunction with injuries to ligaments and menisci. People with previous surgical interventions face more chances of articular cartilage damage due to altered mechanics of the joint.
Articular cartilage does not usually regenerate (the process of repair by formation of the same type of tissue) after injury or disease leading to loss of tissue and formation of a defect. This fact was first described by William Hunter in 1743. Several surgical techniques have been developed in the effort to repair articular cartilage defects.
Diagnoses.
No non-invasive tests are currently able to diagnose articular cartilage damage. Additionally, symptoms vary considerably from person to person. Or as Dr. Karen Hambly stated:
MRI-scans are becoming more valuable in the analysis of articular cartilage but their use is still expensive and time consuming. X-rays only show bone injuries and are therefore not very helpful in diagnosing cartilage damage, especially not in early stages. The best tool for diagnosing articular damage is the use of arthroscopy.
Measuring cartilage damage.
The International Cartilage Repair Society has set up an arthroscopic grading system by which cartilage defects can be ranked:
Doctors will often also measure the size of each defect. Defects smaller than 2 cm2, for example, are considered to be small. It is also important to remember that although the amount of damage is an important factor, the location of the defect(s) can also influence the symptoms you are getting in terms of pain and function and their repair options available.
In contrast to popular perception, pain is not a good indicator for determining the extent of articular cartilage damage. One person can have severe pain with a single small defect while another person can have very little pain with several large full thickness defects.
Consequences.
Articular cartilage has a very limited capacity for self repair. Small damage does not repair itself and can often get worse over time. As cartilage is aneural and avascular (lack of nerve and blood supply, respectively), shallow damage often does not trigger pain.
When the damage increases and the chondral defect reaches the subchondral bone, the blood supply in the bone starts a healing process in the defect. Scar tissue made up of a type of cartilage called fibrocartilage is then formed. Although fibrocartilage is able to fill in articular cartilage defects its structure is significantly different to that of hyaline cartilage; it is much denser and it doesn't withstand the demands of everyday activities as much as hyaline cartilage. It is therefore at a higher risk of breaking down.
Wang "et al."(2006) found that small articular cartilage defects can progress to osteoarthritis over time if left untreated. An articular cartilage defect that initially may be small still has the potential to have a physical and chemical "domino effect" on the surrounding "normal" articular cartilage.
Treatment.
Though articular cartilage damage is not life threatening, it does strongly affect one's quality of life. Articular cartilage damage is often the cause of severe pain, knee swelling, substantial reduction in mobility and severe restrictions to one's activities. Over the last decades, however, research has focused on regenerating damaged joints.
These regenerative procedures are believed to delay osteoarthritis of injuries on the articular cartilage of the knee, by slowing down the degeneration of the joint compared to untreated damage. According to Mithoefer "et al." (2006), these articular cartilage repair procedures offer the best results when the intervention takes place in the early stages of the cartilage damage.

Don Rutherford

Donald Rutherford OBE (born 22 September 1937) is a former international rugby union player. He was also the first ever Technical Director of the Rugby Football Union at Twickenham, becoming Director of Rugby where he served with distinction from 1969 – 1999.
During his career he played for St Luke's College, RAF, Combined Services, Percy Park, Wasps and Northumberland. However he is most closely associated with Gloucester and Gloucestershire for whom he played from 1964 to 1968.
He won fourteen caps for England, the first in 1960 against Wales, which England won 14–0; and toured Australia and New Zealand with the 1966 British Lions. He appeared for the Barbarians on a number of occasions between 1960 and 1968 including one as captain.
Personal history.
Don Rutherford trained as a physical education teacher at St Luke's College, Exeter. He did his National Service in the RAF. He played for the RAF and Combined Services and while still in the RAF he had his first England trial in 1958, playing for the Whites against the Colours (scrum half for the Colours in that trial was Micky Booth).
He had already joined Percy Park RFC in Northumberland and played for the club until 1963. During that time he won his first four caps for England in the 1960 Five Nations tournament and appeared against South Africa at Twickenham in January 1961. He played an outstanding game for North East Counties against the All Blacks in January 1964.
At the end of the 1963–64 season Don Rutherford joined Gloucester. He made his debut for Gloucestershire in November 1964 and was selected for the first of the 1965 Home Internationals, scoring the winning points in a surprise win against France 9–6.
He was an ever-present for England in the Five Nations in 1964–65 and 1965–66 and was then selected to tour Australia and New Zealand with the British Lions. He played in the first of the two Internationals against Australia but on the New Zealand leg of the tour he broke his arm playing against Manuwatu, which required a metal plate and had to be flown home. He played once more for England against New Zealand in 1967.
Rutherford had a successful season for Gloucester and Gloucestershire in 1967–68. He captained the club, playing with remarkable consistency and scoring over 300 points. He broke his arm again playing for the Barbarians against Newport in April 1968 and he was advised to retire from the game.
While with Gloucester, Don Rutherford introduced a coaching creed that was continued in the successful years that followed under the captaincy of Dick Smith.
Rutherford became Technical Director of the Rugby Union in September 1969 – their first-ever professional appointment. In 30 years at the RFU he initiated coaching and playing programmes, which have been emulated by rugby playing countries across the world. He was made Director of Rugby and built up a nationwide structure, starting with mini-rugby through to the national team, providing a stream of playing talent.
He returned to Kingsholm in October 1973, having assembled an international team to play Gloucester in their centenary game.

Static Rituals

The Static Rituals were a Toledo, Ohio-based band formed in 1996. Starting out in high school, they were quite prolific, but slowed down in later years. The band had well over 40 members in their constantly changing line-up, a la The Fall (band) including Dan Greunke of Glide, Ben Swank of Soledad Brothers and Mayuko Hyachi of Detroit's Cyril Lords. The band still plays shows few and far between. The current line-up as of the Spring of 2012 includes Leara Dallas, Kevin Bodnar, Matthew Wood, William Tuite and founding member Brett R. Jan. Well regarded for their participation on the "Purr Like a Kitten" LP, they were also known for their faux band feuds with fellow Toledo-based bands Stylex, Premonitions of War and others, which toward the end of the 90s, was a distraction of their musical ability leading to a focus more on their drinking and shock aspect. This might have led to the end of their productive run for the 2000s. A final release entitled "The Steadfast Passion Vacuum" is expected for release in some format in 2012.

History 1996 - 2004.
The band formed in Southeast Michigan, but became a staple in Toledo, Ohio in the mid-to-late 1990s at local rock venues such as Frankie's Inner-City and Mickey Finn's Pub. To date, their most well-known release is their contributions to the "Purr Like a Kitten" LP compilation, which featured tracks from other Toledo, Ohio and Detroit area musicians such as Jessica Bailiff and Soledad Brothers, among others. There have been many line-up changes in the 12-year history, and because they have slowed down their pace, their live shows in recent years have been up in the air as to whether or not it is going to be a 2-piece, a 5-piece, a punk show, a cover show, drag show, or any other combination of former, special guest or current members. There have been many falling outs, on-stage and off, break-ups and reunions.
"The Steadfast Passion Vacuum" 2012 - FUTURE.
Members are split between Chicago, IL, Toledo, Ohio and Detroit, MI. The only known future plan was to be the release of their fourth full-length studio album, entitled "The Steadfast Passion Vacuum". A cassette of the album in its entirety recorded by Jan from start to finish on acoustic guitar and vocals has been floating around in the hands of potential album participants, producers, current & ex-members since 2006. Doug Walker (former drummer for Brian Jonestown Massacre* & former leader of legendary Toledo, Ohio space-noise-pop quartet Xebec has agreed to produce. As for what format (EP, split compilation of EP's being referred to as "The 4-EP Project"* with The Zimmerman Twins among others; or as a full-length) the album will hit the record store shelves courtesy of one of two old familiar friends of the band: Edward Shimborske III's revamped Sin Klub Entertainment (who released two Rituals' songs on 2000's Exposed III compilation), or former Rituals' bassist Ben Langlois's upstart Old West End Records.*

Dumitru Pârvulescu

Dumitru Pârvulescu (or, in older spelling, Pîrvulescu; June 14, 1933 in Lugoj, Timiş County — 2006 in Bucharest) was a Romanian Greco-Roman style wrestler and Olympic champion.
Sporting career.
He took up wrestling at a very young age, with the “Vulturii” club in Lugoj. During his career he would also represent the following clubs: “Știința” Bucharest, “Steagul Roșu” Braşov and (for the most part) Steaua Bucharest.
His international debut was in an international tournament in East Berlin (1951) where he finished second. His Olympic debut (Helsinki 1952) was less successful (2 defeats, 9th place). He narrowly missed the podium in the World Championship in Naples, 1953 (4th place, losing only to World champion Ahmet Bilek of Turkey). He also finished 4th in the 1956 Summer Olympic Games in Melbourne,and then 6th in the World Championship in Budapest, 1958. 
Many were sceptic about how he would fare at the 1960 Summer Olympic Games in Rome. However, after victories against wrestlers from the US, Japan and Yugoslavia and a draw against the Soviet representative, Pârvulescu found himself facing one of the hosts’sporting heroes, the deaf wrestler Ignazio Fabbra, one of the undisputed stars of the 52 kg category, in the gold medal bout. The Romanian’s intelligent tactics secured him a narrow points victory and the Olympic title.
Pârvulescu went on to win silver in the World Championship in Yokohama, 1961 and bronze in the 1964 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo. Losing to Gheorghe Berceanu in the Romanian championship finally persuaded him to retire “from the mat” and become a coach.
Coaching career.
Dumitru Pârvulescu coached for Steaua Bucharest and subsequently for L.C. “Vulcan” Bucharest. In addition, he was often commissioned by the Romanian wrestling Federation to select talented youngsters from various parts of the country. Pârvulescu was credited with coaching World champion and Olympic silver medalist Constantin Alexandru and with discovering a young talent who would become 1984 Olympic champion in the 100 kg category Vasile Andrei. He was also a mentor and confident of World and Olympic 48 kg champion Gheorghe Berceanu.
Distinctions.
In 2004, the Romanian Presidency awarded Pârvulescu and other former Olympians the National “Faithful Service” Order, the highest civilian distinction in Romania.

UNICEF Ireland

UNICEF Ireland, also known as the Irish National Committee for UNICEF, is one of 36 UNICEF National Committees based in industrialised countries. 
The National Committees raise funds for the organisation's worldwide emergency and development work. 
UNICEF Ireland advises the Irish Government and other bodies on policies and legislation which support the above programmes and commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
UNICEF is not funded by the UN. Instead, it relies on voluntary donations to fund its work for children worldwide. UNICEF Ireland raises funds for these programmes through donations, the sale of cards and gifts, partnerships with companies and special events. UNICEF Ireland is a registered charity.
UNICEF Ireland Ambassadors.
UNICEF Ireland Ambassadors have the ability to focus the world’s attention on the needs of children, helping them to reach a wider audience, allowing them to further highlight the work they undertake to improve the lives of the most vulnerable children around the world.
All of their ambassadors dedicate time and energy to UNICEF Ireland in a variety of ways; visiting field projects throughout the world, speaking to the media about what they have seen, or lobbying and raising money on their behalf.
UNICEF Ireland Ambassadors include Gabriel Byrne, Donncha O'Callaghan, Rory McIlroy, Stephen Rea, Cathy Kelly, Joe Canning, Dermot Earley, Dustin the Turkey and 
UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Liam Neeson.
Campaigns.
UNICEF Ireland’s first “Euro for Zero” campaign took place from the 24 October 2010 – 7 November 2010.During these two weeks, UNICEF Ireland's goal was to raise over €1,000,000 simply by getting every adult in Ireland to donate €1 each to UNICEF.
Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is a comprehensive human rights treaty which enshrines specific children’s rights in international law. These rights define universal principles and standards for the status and treatment of children worldwide.
The Convention spells out a specific role for UNICEF, in its capacity as the UN body responsible for the rights of children. UNICEF is required to promote the effective implementation of the Convention and to encourage international cooperation for the benefit of children. UNICEF is also entitled to be represented when each country’s implementation of the Convention is considered by the Committee every five years.
UNICEF in Ireland.
In Ireland, UNICEF works to promote the rights of all children living in Ireland, regardless of race, religion or nationality and is a member of the Children's Rights Alliance.
Change the Future Report Series
In 2011, UNICEF Ireland is publishing a series of four reports that present the findings of primary research carried out among Irish teenagers in late 2010. The series of reports entitled “Change the Future” will be released periodically by UNICEF Ireland in 2011 and will come together to paint a holistic picture on teenage well-being in Ireland, in the words of young people themselves.
The First Report focuses on ‘happiness’ and explores general themes around teenage well-being throughout the country.
Corporate partners.
UNICEF is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and the support from corporate partners makes a significant contribution to its work. Companies that currently have a corporate partnership with UNICEF Ireland include Aer Lingus, Fyffes, IKEA, Topaz Energy and Pampers.
Change for Good.
In 2009, Tesco used “Change for Good” as advertising, which is trade marked by UNICEF internationally for charity usage but is not trademarked for commercial or retail use which prompted the agency to say "it is the first time in UNICEF’s history that a commercial entity has purposely set out to capitalise on one of our campaigns and subsequently damage an income stream which several of our programmes for children are dependent on”.They went on to call on the public “who have children’s welfare at heart, to consider carefully who they support when making consumer choices”.
2011 Chief Executive dismissal.
In July 2011, former UNICEF Ireland executive director Melanie Verwoerd said she was “deeply shocked” to have been sacked from the charity because of the publicity surrounding her relationship with Gerry Ryan. Three top Hollywood stars Liam Neeson, Vanessa Redgrave and Roger Moore expressed their sadness over the dismissal. However, all three Goodwill Ambassadors are continuing to support UNICEF.
Peter Power, a former Fianna Fáil minister for Overseas Development, was appointed Executive Director in December 2011. The charity will not reveal how much Power is paid, which is at odds with internationally accepted best practice for the information charities should disclose about their spending.

Walter Clough

Walter Owen Clough (15 September 1846 – 17 April 1922) was a British Liberal Party politician.
Clough was born in Huddersfield Yorkshire on 15 September 1846.
He was elected at the 1892 general election as a Member of Parliament for Portsmouth. Portsmouth's two MPs (one Liberal Unionist and one Conservative) had not stood for re-election, and Clough was one of the two Liberals elected to replace them.
He was re-elected in 1895, but did not serve a full term, and resigned his seat on 23 April 1900 by the technical device of accepting appointment as Steward of the Manor of Northstead, a notional "office of profit under The Crown". The by-election for his seat was held on 3 May 1900, and won by the Liberal candidate Thomas Bramsdon.
In the 1901 Census of London Clough is listed as a 54-year old Chartered Accountant & Auditor Magistrate and D L of the City of London living at Manor House, Upper Richmond Road, Barnes, Surrey with his wife Hannah and two sons.
Clough died in the Kingston Registration district on 17 April 1922.

Whitemans Green

Whiteman's Green is a place in the north of the large village and civil parish of Cuckfield in the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex, England. It is located on the southern slopes of the Weald, two miles (3.2 km) west of Haywards Heath and surrounded on other sides by Cuckfield Rural civil parish. The area was designated a conservation area in 1989. There are five listed buildings, the earliest of which dates back to the 15th century.
History.
In 1822 Gideon Mantell discovered the fossilised remains of the first dinosaur to be found in England in a quarry at Whiteman's Green. In 1944 one of the three V-1 flying bomb to land on England the first night they were used fell at Mizbrooks Farm just to the west.
Facilities.
Whiteman's Green has its own Post Office incorporated into the local shop. There is a petrol station which serves Cuckfield, and traffic heading to the A23 road. Cuckfield Golf Course is located to the west of Whiteman's Green, along with Cuckfield's largest pet store. Whiteman's Green in also home to the "Ship Inn", and a second hand car dealership.
Recreation.
Whiteman's Green has a large recreation ground, home to the local football team, Cuckfield Cosmos, and neighbouring town Haywards Heath's Rugby Team. The ground is also regularly used by kitesurfers due to the strong winds often present. A recent addition to this area is the Skate Park. Parking is limited, and at busy times, namely Saturday mornings, cars park along the main road. Calls for parking restrictions or car park expansion have been made by local residents of Mill Hall. A skate park is now in place on the green itself. The Ship Inn is a notable public house situated in Whiteman's Green, and is the location of the Brook Street Rowing Club's annual dinner.
Mill Hall.
Mill Hall was a school for the deaf, first opened just after the second world war. The first headmistress was Mrs Crosby. 
It closed in the 1990s with the opening of Court Meadow school in Cuckfield. It has since been developed into housing, and until recently was home to Mill Hall School Day Nursery - which closed in 2008.

Uncertain data

In computer science, uncertain data is the notion of data that contains specific uncertainty. Uncertain data is typically found in the area of sensor networks. When representing such data in a database, some indication of the probability of the various values.
There are three main models of uncertain data in databases. In attribute uncertainty, each uncertain attribute in a tuple is subject to its own independent probability distribution. For example, if readings are taken of temperature and wind speed, each would be described by its own probability distribution, as knowing the reading for one measurement would not provide any information about the other.
In correlated uncertainty, multiple attributes may be described by a joint probability distribution. For example, if readings are taken of the position of an object, and the "x"- and "y"-coordinates stored, the probability of different values may depend on the distance from the recorded coordinates. As distance depends on both coordinates, it may be appropriate to use a joint distribution for these coordinates, as they are not independent.
In tuple uncertainty, all the attributes of a tuple are subject to a joint probability distribution. This covers the case of correlated uncertainty, but also includes the case where there is a probability of a tuple not belonging in the relevant relation, which is indicated by all the probabilities not summing to one. For example, assume we have the following tuple from a probabilistic database:
Then, the tuple has 10% chance of not existing in the database.

Politics of Liguria

The Politics of Liguria, Italy takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.
Executive.
The Regional Government ("Giunta Regionale") is presided by the President of the Region ("Presidente della Regione"), who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed by the President and the Ministers ("Assessori"), who are currently 11, including a Vice President.
Legislative branch.
The Regional Council of Liguria ("Consiglio Regionale della Liguria") is composed of 40 members. 32 councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 8 councillors (elected in bloc) come from a "regional list", including the President-elect. One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second. If a coalition wins more than 50% of the total seats in the Council with PR, only 4 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 36. If the winning coalition receives less than 40% of votes special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.
The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the "simul stabunt, simul cadent" prevision introduced in 1999 (literally "they will stand together or they will fall together"), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.
Parties and elections.
In the last regional election, which took place on 28–29 March 2010, Claudio Burlando (Democratic Party) defeated Sandro Biasotti (The People of Freedom).

Nsambya Home Care

Nsambya Home Care (NHC) is one of the departments of Nsambya Hospital, a faith-based hospital in Uganda. The department offers medical and psychosocial support to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). During 2003, 21% (309/1435) PLWHAs were registered as having tuberculosis (TB). These patients were followed up for treatment outcomes. A total of 126 patients were expected to complete treatment by the end of 2003. The treatment default rates were 56%, 50% and approximately 80% among the new, relapse and former defaulter TB patients, respectively. NHC, established in 1987 by Sr. Miriam Duggan, is a department of St. Francis Hospital Nsambya. Since then NHC has been providing care and treatment services to over 15,000 clients cumulatively (to-date). With support from the AIDS Relief program and in collaboration with Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the program started providing ARVs in 2004 and so far close to 2000 active patients are benefiting from treatment. It is headquartered in Nsambya, a section of Kampala, Uganda. A field office of the program is located at Ggaba, a southern suburb of Kampala. NHC has approximately fifty (50) employees, as of December 2007. The Organisation is led by Dr Maria Nannyonga Musoke a consultant paediatrician of Nsambya Hospital.
History.
Nsambya Home Care was initially founded and managed by the Franciscan Sisters, as a response to the AIDS scourge in 1987. There was overcrowding in the Nsambya Hospital wards; hence the opening of a separate department for AIDS patients. Rooms were eventually put up for counselling to ensure confidentiality. The very weak clients who were not getting better were visited in their homes by a doctor, a nurse and a counsellor.
In 1987 a total number of 327 clients were registered. The numbers increased as years went by. Different interventions were put in place to respond to challenges that cropped up. These included the creation of outreach clinics, Behavior Change Programs, Paediatric Counselling, Income Generating Activities, Youth Forum for the youth, Pastoral care services, Education for life programs, AIDS sensitization programs and involvement of client volunteers in the program.
Aids patient Care in areas of high sero-prevalence is becoming a problem, with increasing demand on hospital bed capacity. Various innovative approaches have been tried to provide care, but cost analysis against benefits of these approaches has rarely been done. Nsambya Hospital used inpatient, outpatient and outreach mobile Home Care for AIDS to provide a continuum of care since 1989. Hospital records of AIDS patients cared for and the corresponding costs were analyzed for a rough cost benefit evaluation of this approach.
Chronic illness is a common but very much neglected health problem in sub Saharan Africa. People suffer from longstanding pain and symptoms caused by ‘incurable’ conditions like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, COPD and kidney failure. In the last decade, the numerous AIDS patients have joined this group. Their main and common problem is a longstanding, progressively debilitating condition, which silently undermines their physical and mental health and weakens their socio-economic status.
To date Nsambya Home Care has more than 10,000 active clients involving children. This paper will discuss the interventions put up by a religious based organization in fighting, and caring for AIDS patients without blaming or condemning them.
Activities.
Nsambya Home Care offers services like;
Children sick with HIV/AIDS are ostracized by family members, communities, schools and playmates who fear contracting the disease. They are denied play, stopped from going to school, used by own parents to ascertain own sero-status. Those who opt to take them up demand for blood check ups against the children's will. Children are always told lies about the kind of check up, counselling for Pre-test is always given to care-givers and not the real children, the sero-status is always discussed and known by relatives or care-givers and medical workers but not the children themselves.
The whole situation of counselling and testing children defy the issue of making an "informed decision" for the HIV test and the professional ethics regarding confidentiality. The patient's own consent on whatever is to be done on him or her is broken since the child's care-giver handles the counselling and caring that involves the child. The children's own stories about their feeling and problems they meet regarding HIV/AIDS are tested and counselling shared. The importance of disclosure to the child, confidentiality and information sharing concerning the child's sero-status are analyzed.
"Nsambya Home Care informs people about the spread of HIV/AIDS. Dr. Maria Nannyonga said that AIDS is spread mainly through having unprotected sex with an infected person. Secondly, she said the HIV virus is spread through blood transfusion. This still a big problem because some of the blood donated could contain the AIDS virus, but because it is still in its early stages (the window period), the blood still tests negative and then transfused into a patient.
The virus can also be transmitted from mother to child. This can be before, during or after childbirth. The virus can only be transmitted to an unborn child if there is a damage to the placenta otherwise an infected mother can give birth to a healthy baby. A baby on the other hand can get infected through breast feeding. The infected mother is thus expected to only bottle feed the baby since the breast milk contains HIV. AIDS can also be further spread through un-sterilized instruments like needles, razors, knives. This mainly affects traditionalists who are exposed to such objects especially during circumcision.
There is a general belief that one can be infected during the act of deep kissing. However, according to the doctor at the center, this is only possible if the uninfected person has a sore in the mouth or if that person swallows twenty liters of saliva of the infected person. Normal kissing usually does not carry those risks.
NHC teaches about the signs and symptoms of HIV/AIDS. There are major and minor symptoms. It also teaches about various ways of reducing the transmission of the HIV infection. Dr Erika Vlieghe a physician who previously worked at NHC writes *
"Monday morning, a rural district hospital in Uganda. A ward round through Female Ward. A 40-year-old woman has been brought in with diabetic coma. She is actually recovering while receiving insulin, but how to continue the treatment at the village? Two women in their fifties are recovering from another exacerbation of cardiac failure. For one, it is already her third admission since last summer. They complain of painful ascites and their failure to perform the household tasks. In the same room, three women aged between 25 and 45 are admitted with extensive and very painful breast tumours. They are very embarrassed about the deformities and the smell. The nearest place offering specialist care for cancer patients and radiotherapy is away, through a war-ridden area.
In the next bed, an emaciated old lady has hardly been eating or drinking for the last 6 weeks because of an oesophageal tumour. In the afternoon, a 45-year-old women is found to have a locally spread tumour of the cervix. She thinks she cannot afford to go for radiotherapy, although the smelling vaginal discharge and the pain are really disturbing her. A young man is very uncomfortable with his legs swollen and knobbly because of Kaposi's sarcoma. He does not know he has AIDS. He hopes he can go back to the kraal soon. In the evening, an old man arrives from a place away because of a painful hard swelling in his upper abdomen: a gross liver tumour.
Unfortunately, the needs of those chronically ill are not met by far in most existing health care services. If the illness has a treatable or stabilisable cause (e.g. diabetes, or some types and stages of cancer), often the treatment is not available, not maintained for a long period or not given in an adequate way. Thereby, little or no attention is given to the broader needs in chronic illness: follow-up, counselling, information and education, involvement of the relatives, social or material support, rehabilitation. It seems that in general, chronic illness does not fit in most of the existing services, as they are designed for acute and communicable diseases and for standardisable, short episode illnesses. In most programs and reports on health needs in sub Saharan Africa, chronic illness is not given adequate attention or the priority it deserves. There are several reasons for this lack of priority. Some are true, and difficult to resolve, but many arguments originate from misconceptions, myths and a reluctance to face changing health patterns in developing countries."
Funding.
Nsambya Home Care is funded by a number of organisations like Catholic Relief Services and CAFOD. However, with the completion of the new building project, there is still a shortage of funds to care for the ever increasing number of patients. This is the list of funded programmes in the country by CAFOD, ActionAid, Christian Aid, ICCO and Oxfam.
Future and development.
On December 4, 2007, Nsambya Home Care celebrated twenty (20) years of hard work and dedicated service to communities affected by the HIV pandemic. Celebrations to mark NHC's 20th anniversary coincided with the official opening of the new building complex just opposite Nsambya Hospital main gate and this was the venue for the day. The guest of honour, Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala, laid the foundation stone.

John Buddle

John Buddle (September 15, 1773 – October 10, 1843) was a prominent self-made mining engineer and entrepreneur in North East England. He had a major influence on the development of the Northern Coalfield in the first half of the 19th century, contributing to the safety of mining coal by innovations such as the introduction of the Davy Lamp, the keeping of records of ventilation, and the prevention of flooding. He was also interested in shipping as an owner, and built Seaham Harbour, establishing an important trade dock. He was chairman of the company that built the Tyne Dock at South Shields, and was also involved in the creation of two harbours and the development of a tunnel.
Early life.
Born on September 15, 1773 at West Kyo, near Stanley, County Durham, Buddle was the only son and the fourth of six children born to John Buddle, senior, and Mary Reay. John Buddle senior was a mathematician who worked at a local school before pursuing a career in the mining industry, being responsible for his son's wide education, particularly in maths and science. One of his earliest notebooks resides in the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, containing notes on a wide range of scientific and geographical topics. Buddle's father also gave him a practical education in mining, even as early, John Buddle commented as "six years old". At the age of 19, John Buddle became the underviewer to his father, and in 1801 he was appointed viewer of Benwell Colliery, soon buying a thirteenth share in the colliery worth £2,700, beginning his role as a Director with a salary of £100 a year.
The Wallsend colliery.
John Buddle followed his father into the profession of colliery viewer, a calling which he helped to develop towards the modern concept of a mining engineer. He succeeded his father as manager at Wallsend Colliery in 1806, though his work was not limited to just the local colliery. Buddle was involved with the introduction of the miners safety lamp invented by Humphry Davy being involved in the earliest discussions with Davy in August 1815 and providing "fire-damp" samples for experiments in Davy's London Laboratory.
The moment when Buddle tested the new Davy safety lamp for the first time, for real, in Northeast England, is recorded by him in a report to the Select Committee on Accidents in Mines on the 4 September 1835 "I first tried the lamp in an explosive mixture on the surface; and then took it to the mine; it is impossible for me to express my feelings at the time when I first suspended the lamp in the mine and saw it red hot. I said to those around me: "We have at last subdued this monster [fire-damp]." This is a record of one of the most significant moments in the industrialization of the World.
John Buddle was a member of the Sunderland Society, set up to investigate colliery safety, and in this connection made scientific investigations into mine ventilation and advocated the keeping of proper records. The most important appointment, however, came when Buddle was appointed as General Manager to Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry. Londonderry had married an incredibly wealthy heiress, said to be the wealthiest woman in Britain, Lady Frances Anee Vane Tempest, and thus came to run her Durham collieries . Together, Londonderry and Buddle embarked on a project to develop a Port at Seaham, intending to bypass the Tyne and Wear monopolies. The building of the port began in 1828, and would not be finished until fifteen years later, in which the first shipment of coal was sent out on Buddle's personal ship, Lord Seaham. He even saw through much of the development of the town, his influence being so great that, when his sister Ann died, the ships dressed in black and the shops closed as a matter of respect. He also represented the Marquess on the committee of coalowners who regulated the North East coal trade with London. Although he was mostly active in the Great North Coalfield, the records show Buddle took on work all over Britain, including matters in Portugal, South America, Russia and Nova Scotia. Two of his latest colliery appointments were in 1837 when he became the owner of West Towneley Colliery and also the viewer to the Bishop of Durham- a post previously held by his Father.
In collaboration with William Chapman, Buddle is also considered to have designed the pioneering locomotive "Steam Elephant" for Wallsend Colliery and an eight-wheeled geared engine for the Lambton Waggonway.
Buddle was a coalowner in his own right as well as a viewer and practical manager for many pits in the region of the rivers Tyne and Wear, and his advice was sought on both mining and railways from as far afield as Nova Scotia.
Buddle was an active member of Newcastle society, and held numerous positions in his lifetime. In 1838, he was elected vice-president of the prestigious Literary and Philosophical Society and also became vice- president of the North of England Fine Arts Society. In 1842 he was appointed as Steward for Northumberland at the Newcastle Infirmary, a position which allowed him to appoint physicians to the hospital, and, due to his interest in theatre, he was Chairman of the committee for the new theatre in the 1830s, and he personally designed the heating system for the Theatre Royal. Throughout his life, Buddle donated money to numerous causes, including one to relieve the poverty of seamen employed in the Northern Whale Fishery, the benefit of widows and orphans of mining disasters, and the erection of Penshaw monument in memory of his friend John George Lambton, first Earl of Durham.
Death.
A Unitarian, Buddle died unmarried at his home in Wallsend in 1843, after becoming ill after riding with Lord Londonderry to inspect the collieries. He left a personal fortune of around £150,000 to his nephew, Robert Thomas Atkinson, who died less than two years later. They are both buried at St James' Churchyard, Benwell, along with Robert's Aunt. When Buddle died, his funeral procession was over a mile long and took over three hours to travel from his home in Wallsend to his resting place in Benwell. The number of mourners was so great that, according to one contemporary newspaper report, "so large a concourse of people was perhaps never before assembled in Newcastle on such a mournful occasion". The long list of pall bearers and principal mourners included many of the most rich and powerful men in Newcastle, such as local councillor and wealthy corn merchant William Armstrong and his son, also William, who was just a few years away from setting up his great engineering works on the banks of the Tyne in Elswick.

George Augustus Williams

George Augustus Williams (4 May 1814 - 26 May 1901 ) was an English landscape painter during the Victorian era, and a member of the Williams family of painters.
Biography.
George Augustus Williams was born on May 4, 1814 in London. He was the third son of the painter Edward Williams (1781-1855) and Ann Hildebrandt (c.1780-1851), and a member of the Williams family of painters, who were related to such famous artists as James Ward, R.A. and George Morland. His father was a well-known landscape artist, who taught him how to paint; otherwise he received no formal instruction.
George Augustus painted riverscapes of the Thames, moonlit landscapes, seascapes and views of Kent, Wales and elsewhere. After having four children, George and Caroline moved to Barnes, London, within a stone's throw of the Thames, where they lived for more than fifty years.
George undoubtedly inherited his artistic talent, as did his siblings, from his father. His work, though, is distinct from that of the others in his family. His paintings were mainly exhibited at Suffolk Street as well as at the Royal Academy from 1841 onwards, the British Institution and elsewhere.
George's wife Caroline died sometime before the 1861 U.K. census was taken, after which his daughter, named Caroline also, became his housekeeper, foregoing marriage to take care of her father. He died forth years later at the age of 46 on 26 May 1901 in Barnes, London.
Marriage and children.
George married Caroline Smith (b. 1814), the daughter of Abraham and Charlotte Smith, on 19 February 1835 at St. Pancras Church in Camden, London. They had five children.
The Williams Family.
George Augustus Williams was born into an artist family that is sometimes referred to as the Barnes School. His father and five surviving brothers (listed below) were all noted Victorian landscape painters. Three of the sons of Edward Williams changed their last names to protect the identity of their art.

Wannabe Wicked

Wannabe Wicked is a talent competition conceived for fans of the musical "Wicked". Contestants compete in a series of performances judged by industry professionals, and those who perform successfully move on later rounds. The criteria that must be met in order to succeed is based on vocal quality, performance delivery, vocal accuracy and overall performance. In the end, the winner receives a walk-on role onto the hit musical "Wicked".
Wannabe Wicked Origins.
The concept for Wicked fans to experience a day in a life of a Wicked performer originated in Great Britain in which fans submitted auditions videos singing an excerpt of a song from the musical. From those videos, a select few were chosen to compete in later rounds. The winner of the Wannabe Wicked contest in Great Britain was Louise Henderson. She won a walk-on role and was able to experience the many aspects of the daily routine of the Wicked performers.
For more information of the British version of the competition check out: Wannabe Wicked UK
Wannabe Wicked in North America.
The Wannabe Wicked contest made its way to Los Angeles, California in the summer of 2008. It involved a series of three rounds that the contestants had to contend with, which consisted of the video audition, semi-finals live performance at City Walk at Universal Studios Hollywood, and the finals live performance at City Walk at Universal Studios Hollywood. All of this was part of the Wicked Wednesday summer series at Universal Studios.Universal Studios Hollywood.
Contestants chosen from the video auditions were notified of their day to perform live in the semi-finals. The performances for the semi-finals and finals were to be judged by top industry professionals. There were five days of semi-finals competition each with a total of ten contestants. At the end of each of the semi-final rounds, three contestants were selected to move onto the final round, which was held on August 20, 2008. There were a total of fifteen contestants that performed during the finals, and the talent was fierce. Prior to the finals, a separate contest, which was called the Fan Favorite, was posted online to showcase all the finalists' performances from the semi-finals. Online viewers were given the option to vote for their favorite performer. 
As great as the performances were on the online videos, the finals revealed a more ready, talented and ferocious group of performers, which was not reflective of what was seen online. The contestants all performed ultimately better than what was seen from the semi-finals. Every contestant brought their own personalities to their songs, and performed in front of a massive crowd showing off what they were made to do. One contestant, Kingsley Malang, was noted by the emcee as being the only male of the competition to perform a song written for the part of a female, in which he succeeded. His performance included the actual "blocking" that Elphaba performs from the stage production. 
Local news media was also present at the event capturing all the performances in anticipation of the selected winner. NBC was one of the media presences that took coverage of the event.
Fan Favorite.
Not only was a winner for the walk-on role to be selected but also a fan favorite. The fan favorite was determined by an online site, which showcased the semi-final performances of each of the fifteen contestants and allowed people to vote for their favorite. On August 20, 2008, the fan favorite was announced along with the winner of the walk-on role. Dawn Borroso was the lucky winner of the fan favorite. 
The Contestant Lineup.
The following shows the contestants and the song they performed in no particular order:
Contestants were given the choice of singing the following excerpts from the musical:
The Winner.
Despite the immense talent that was showcased, only "one" winner was to be chosen. There was a panel of five judges consisting of industry professionals during the finals, and they were hard pressed to come to a decision. Ultimately, the crowd waited in suspense as the winner was announced. The winner, Connie Zamora, not only won a walk-on role in the Los Angeles production of Wicked at the Pantages Theater but also won several tickets to bring anyone she chooses to come watch at the time of her performance. The local news media was ready to capture her excitement upon the conclusion and results of the competition.

Colinton Parish Church

Colinton Parish Church is a congregation of the Church of Scotland. The church building is located in Dell Road, Colinton, Edinburgh, Scotland.
A church has stood on the site for approximately 1000 years, but the current building was constructed and reopened in 1908. A new, adjacent church hall was added in the 1990s.
The current church was rebuilt in 1907-8 by the architect Sydney Mitchell. The church incorporates the tower from the old church, which had been designed by David Bryce and built in 1837. The interior has a neo-Byzantine design, with pink sandstone columns.

Appendix J Touring Cars

Appendix J Touring Cars was an Australian motor racing category for modified, production based sedans. It was the premier form of Touring car racing in Australia from 1960 to 1964. 
The category was introduced by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport to take effect from January 1960. Prior to the introduction of Appendix J, there had been no national regulations for touring car racing in Australia with individual race promoters applying differing rules regarding eligibility and modification of the cars being raced. Under Appendix J, eligibility was restricted to closed cars with seating for four persons and at least one hundred examples of the model had to have been produced. Bodywork and interior trim had to remain virtually standard, however engines and suspensions could be modified to improve performance and handling. Modifications were permitted in the areas of carburettors, valves, pistons, camshafts, inlet systems, exhaust systems, springs and shock absorbers. Cars competed in numerous classes based on engine capacity with the regulations allowing an increase in capacity up to the limit of the relevant class. Many highly modified cars which were no longer eligible to compete as Touring Cars found a home in another new CAMS category, Appendix K. This was ostensibly for GT cars but in reality allowed virtually any form of closed vehicle to participate
The Australian Touring Car Championship was run to Appendix J rules from its inception in 1960 up to and including the 1964 title. The inaugural Australian Touring Car Championship race at Gnoo Blas circuit at Orange, New South Wales on 1 February 1960 was in fact the first race to be run under the new Appendix J formula. 
From January 1965, Appendix J was replaced by a new category, Group C for Improved Production Touring Cars.
In 1981 CAMS introduced the Group N Touring Cars category which was intended to recreate the style of racing which had existed under the Appendix J rules. Originally Group N was restricted to cars manufactured before January 1965 however this was later extended to permit models produced up to the end of 1972.

Politics of Marche

The Politics of Marche, Italy, takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of the Region is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Legislative power is vested in the Regional Council, while executive power is exercised by the Regional Government led by the President, who is directly elected by the people. The current Statute has been in force since 2005. 
Although many local authorities of Marche, as all Italy, were ruled the Liberal-conservative coalition that governed the country prior to the rise of Fascism, the region was also one of the regions in which the Italian Socialist Party had a great success. In the 1924 general election, which led Italy to dictatorship, Marche was one of the few regions which did not return an absolute majority to the National Fascist Party during the which led Italy to dictatorship. After World War II Marche became a stronghold of the Italian Communist Party as a member of the "Red Quadrilateral".
Traditionally, Marche gives progressives results during elections, reflecting its agricoltural and rural tradition. The Communists and their successors (the Democratic Party of the Left, the Democrats of the Left and the present-day Democratic Party) always won in the region. Although at the 2013 general election, the anti-political Five Star Movement became the first party in the region.
Executive.
The Regional Government ("Giunta Regionale") is presided by the President of the Region ("Presidente della Regione"), who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed by the President and the Ministers ("Assessori"), who are currently 11, including a Vice President.
Legislative branch.
The Regional Council of Marche ("Consiglio Regionale della Marche") is composed of 40 members. 32 councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 8 councillors (elected in bloc) come from a "regional list", including the President-elect. One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second. If a coalition wins more than 50% of the total seats in the Council with PR, only 4 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 36. If the winning coalition receives less than 40% of votes special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.
The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the "simul stabunt, simul cadent" prevision introduced in 1999 (literally "they will stand together or they will fall together"), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.
Local government.
Provinces.
Marche is divided in five provinces, which were first established in 1861. The centre-left Democratic Party governs four provinces out of five, including Macerata, whose president is a member of the Union of the Centre, and Fermo, whose president is a member of Left Ecology Freedom, a left-wing outfit.
Municipalities.
Marche is also divided in 239 "comuni" (municipalities), which have even more history, having been established in the Middle Ages, when they were the main places of government. The centre-left Democratic Party is widely the strongest party in local government, having the majority of mayors throughout the region.
Parties and elections.
Last regional election.
In the last regional election, which took place on 28–29 March 2010, Gian Mario Spacca of the Democratic Party, supported also by the Union of the Centre and Alliance for Italy, defeated by a comfortable margin his centre-right opponent Erminio Marinelli and, thus, secured a second consecutive term as President.

1973–74 FA Cup

The 1973–74 FA Cup was the 93rd season of the world's oldest football cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup. Liverpool won the competition for only the second time, beating Newcastle United 3–0 in the final at Wembley, London.
Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. Some matches, however, might be rescheduled for other days if there were clashes with games for other competitions or the weather was inclement.In this season matches were allowed to be played on Sundays for the first time. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.
Results.
First Round Proper.
At this stage clubs from the Football League Third and Fourth Divisions joined those non-league clubs having come through the qualifying rounds. Matches were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 24 November 1973. Ten matches were drawn and went to replays.
Second Round Proper.
The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 15 December 1973. Five matches were drawn, with replays taking place later the same week. 
Third Round Proper.
The 44 First and Second Division clubs entered the competition at this stage. The matches were scheduled for the weekend of the 5th/6th January 1974. Thirteen matches were drawn, of which one required a second replay. 
Fourth Round Proper.
The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 26 January 1974. Four matches were, however, played the day after. Eight matches were drawn, of which one, the tie between Portsmouth and Leyton Orient, required a second replay.
Fifth Round Proper.
The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 16 February 1974 with one taking place the day after. Two matches were drawn and went to replays.
Sixth Round Proper.
The four quarter-final ties were played on the 9 March 1974.
Newcastle United riot.
The first Newcastle United–Nottingham Forest game was won 4–3 by Newcastle. However, early in the second half Nottingham Forest went 3–1 up from a penalty awarded by the referee, Gordon Kew. In awarding the penalty, a Newcastle player was sent off. The Newcastle United fans in the Leazes End of the ground (now the Sir John Hall stand) were renowned for their volatility, and invaded the pitch. Two Nottingham Forest players were injured in the debacle, but the referee waited until all players were recovered and received the permission of both managers to continue the tie before restarting it. Newcastle United managed to come back and win in spite of the two-goal and one-player deficit. 23 people were taken to hospital as a result of the pitch invasion, of whom two had fractured skulls. 103 people received treatment at the ground and 39 were arrested. 
Following the riot, a written protest was sent from Nottingham Forest to the FA on the 11 March. In response, the secretary of the FA, Ted Croker, announced that a special four-man subcommittee of the Challenge Cup Committee who oversee the FA Cup competition were to investigate the incident with an eye to disqualifying Newcastle United, stating, "Newcastle could be disqualified. We do not have the power to order a replay as the game was completed." On the 14 March the subcommittee ruled that, in spite of Mr. Croker's comments, the match "was" to be replayed, at a neutral venue on Monday 18 March. If that match was drawn then extra time would be played and, if needed, a second match also at a neutral venue would be played the following Thursday. This decision was unprecedented at the time and the reaction was mixed, with Newcastle defender Frank Clark suggesting that Newcastle's comeback from two goals down and with a player sent off should have allowed them to go through outright. The Nottingham Forest captain stated, "we would have won it fair and square but for the trouble." 
The first replay at Goodison Park was a nervous 0–0 draw and stayed so after extra time. Newcastle finally won the tie through a single Macdonald goal in the second replay at Goodison Park.
Semi-Finals.
The semi-final matches were played on Saturday, 30 March 1974 with the Liverpool–Leicester City game being replayed three days later. Liverpool and Newcastle United won their respective matches to go on to the final at Wembley.
Final.
The final took place on Saturday, 4 May 1974 at Wembley and ended in a victory for Liverpool over Newcastle United by three goals to nil. Two goals were scored by Kevin Keegan and one by Steve Heighway. The attendance was 100,000.

Francis Crane

Sir Francis Crane ("ca." 1579 – "ca." 1636) was the founder of Mortlake Tapestry Works at Mortlake on the south bank of the river Thames in South West London.
Biography.
The tapestry works almost ruined Crane, as it involved him in considerable outlay of capital for an inadequate return, and in 1623 he was forced to appeal to the King, James I for financial help. James I died in 1625 and Crane was given much more favourable terms by the new King, Charles I, whose secretary he had been since 1617. He sat in the Parliaments of 1614 and 1621 as MP for Penryn and that of 1624 for Launceston.
In 1629 the King gave him the Manor of Stoke Bruerne in Northamptonshire, where he built Stoke Park, a fine Palladian house, possibly with assistance from Inigo Jones.
Family.
Crane's brother, Richard Crane, was created a baronet in 1643.

Ann Maddocks

Ann Maddocks (born Thomas, 1704-1727) was a Welsh maid who according to tradition was forced to marry against her wishes and died pining for her true love. She is also known by the poetic name, The Maid of Cefn Ydfa.
Ann Thomas was born in 1704 to William Thomas of Cefn Ydfa, Llangynwyd and his wife Catherine Price of Tynton, Llangeinor, who was sister to Rees Price, the father of philosopher Richard Price. Thomas and Price married in 1703, but her father died in 1706, and tradition tells that he had placed Ann in the wardship of Anthony Maddocks, a lawyer from Cwmrisga. Maddocks decided that Ann would marry his son, also called Anthony, and records show that the two were married on 4 May 1725.
The folklore.
The legend states that Ann had fallen in love not with the wealthy Maddocks, but with the poet and thatcher, Wil Hopcyn (William Hopkin) and when discovered were forbidden to see each other. The couple continued their relationship by sending love letters to each other in secret, but when these communications were uncovered, Ann's mother took away her writing materials. Unable to be together, Hopcyn left the area, and Ann married Anthony Maddocks. Ann is said to have pined so desperately for her lover that she fell seriously ill. On her death bed she asked to see Hopcyn, and when he arrived she died in his arms.
Records show that Ann Maddocks died in 1727 and was buried on 6 June in "Top Llan"'s Church. St Cynwyd's Church, Llangynwyd
Interpretations.
Several interpretations of the legend have been made in many different formats. Welsh antiquarian Griffith John Williams related and discussed the story in his book "Y Llenor" (1928). It was also the subject of a novel by Isaac Hughes.
The story of the "Maid of Cefn Ydfa" is commemorated in the song "Bugeilio'r Gwenith Gwyn' (Tending the white wheat) in an opera by Welsh composer Joseph Parry based on the words attributed to Wil Hopkyn and Dafydd Nicolas.
In 1904, William Haggar released a silent film, "The Maid of Cefn Ydfa" interperating the events, with his family cast as the main characters of the tale.

<doc id="19058389" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19058389" title="Arizona Proposition 102 (2008)">
Arizona Proposition 102 (2008)

Arizona Proposition 102 was an amendment to the constitution of the state of Arizona adopted by a ballot measure held in 2008. It added Article 30 of the Arizona Constitution, which says:"Only a union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state."
Overview.
On August 26, 2008, Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard and Secretary of State Jan Brewer agreed that the ballot description would state that same-sex marriage was already prohibited by statute. Incorporating the same provision into the Arizona Constitution was meant to prevent an Arizona court from ruling that the statute was invalid under the Arizona Constitution.
Along with similar measures in California (California Proposition 8 (2008)) and Florida (Florida Amendment 2 (2008)), Proposition 102 was decided by voters in the general election on November 4, 2008. The amendment passed by a margin of 56% in favor and 44% against.
Proposition 102 had no immediate impact because its the definition of marriage was consistent with the existing statutory defition. As an amendment to the Constitution of Arizona, the definition cannot be changed by the state legislature, and the possibility that a state court might find a state constitutional guarantee of same-sex couples' right to marry is eliminated.
Supporters and opponents.
As of August 27, 2008 three committees related to Proposition 102 were registered with the Secretary of State: YESforMarriage.com supporting Prop 102 was the one committee in support, and the two committees in opposition were No on Prop 102 and Arizona Together Opposed to Prop 102.
Supporters said that Proposition 102 was necessary to prevent judges changing the legal definition of marriage, as was done in Massachusetts, California, Connecticut and Iowa. Opponents said that Proposition 102 was unnecessary because same-sex marriage was already illegal in Arizona, and that there were more pressing issues facing Arizona; also they cited the issue of the separation of church and state.
Miscellaneous.
Proposition 102 was placed on the ballot via referendum rather than through the initiative process on the last day of the legislative session. Presiding State Senator Jack Harper defeated a filibuster on June 27, 2008 to place the proposed Constitutional Amendment on the ballot. Harper faced an ethics investigation over allegedly violating Senate rules by cutting off the microphones of two senators who were attempting to filibuster the bill. Despite the fact that Harper admitted to cutting off the microphones intentionally, a Senate ethics committee consisting of three Republicans and two Democrats voted 3–2, along strict party lines, to dismiss the charges.
State Senators Jack W. Harper, Ronald Gould, Thayer Verschoor, and John Huppenthal stood out as the proponents of the Marriage Amendment to the Arizona State Constitution. The language of Prop 102 was adopted as a strike-everything amendment to Senator Gould's SCR1042.
In 2006, a more restrictive measure, Proposition 107, had been defeated in the general election.

Tribal Gear

Tribal Gear, Tribal Streetwear or simply Tribal was launched in 1989 by Bobby Ruiz and his brother Joey as a Southern California lifestyle inspired clothing brand. The company recently closed their original San Diego based shop in 2012. 
History.
Bobby Ruiz started Tribal Street wear on the 20th of November in 1989 with his brother Joey. When Bobby was looking for sponsors for a graffiti art/benefit show in San Diego, Carl Arellano, who had a silk screening business offered to sponsor the show. "It was at that point when we became friends and started to talk about him getting involved with Tribal", says Bobby.
Bobby had a concept with artwork. Both Joey and Bobby started with blank white T-shirts that they had bought from people on the streets and factories. Joey was designing tattoo graphics and Bobby started designing graphics too which they used to apply on the T-shirts. Inspired by his graffiti background Bobby wanted to use strong graphics that speak for themselves.
Most graphics were Aztec and Mayan influenced. This is how they came up with the name Tribal.
They started working with graffiti artists who made hip hop inspired graphics. Tribal’s start was rough but Bobby and Carl pulled through it and succeeded in making Tribal successful. Tribal expanded from T-shirts to apparel and accessories. Now almost 20 years after its start, Tribal Street wear is still representing the streets internationally.
Influences.
Latino community.
Tribal Street wear is a lifestyle clothing brand that has made an impact from West to East U.S.A. and even overseas. Tribal became popular in countries like Germany and Japan where the interest in Latino culture has paved the way for California designers to sell street wear.
Bobby wanted his clothing to appeal to everyone, not just Hip Hop heads and Latinos. “We never boxed ourselves in by using one thing that we are into”, explains Bobby “We have a skate team, b-boy team, graffiti artist, and ultimate fighters”. Tribal finds inspiration in graffiti, Hip Hop music and the street culture which are characteristic of the South-Californian Latino lifestyle.
Breakdance.

Württemberg AD

The Württemberg AD was a German steam locomotive built for the Royal Württemberg State Railways. It was an express train engine with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement and was built from 1899 by the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen ('Esslingen Engineering Works'). Up to that point the railway only had increasingly elderly locomotives with a 2-4-0 configuration.
The vehicles were equipped with a two-cylinder, compound engine. The most striking feature was the large, horizontal pipe connecting the two steam domes. Ninety eight engines of this class were built by 1907; they initially had flat slide valves, but from 1903 piston valves were installed.
In 1907 two locomotives were tested with two-cylinder, superheated steam engines. This reduced the boiler overpressure to 117.7 N/cm² and generated an improvement in performance of about 20%. As a result, 17 more locomotives were built to this configuration up to 1909 and were designated as Class ADh.
Both classes began to be retired in the early 1920s.

TESEO

Tecnica Empirica Stima Errori Operatori (TESEO) is a technique in the field of Human reliability Assessment (HRA), that evaluates the probability of a human error occurring throughout the completion of a specific task. From such analyses measures can then be taken to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring within a system and therefore lead to an improvement in the overall levels of safety. There exist three primary reasons for conducting an HRA; error identification, error quantification and error reduction. As there exist a number of techniques used for such purposes, they can be split into one of two classifications; first generation techniques and second generation techniques. First generation techniques work on the basis of the simple dichotomy of ‘fits/doesn’t fit’ in the matching of the error situation in context with related error identification and quantification and second generation techniques are more theory based in their assessment and quantification of errors. ‘HRA techniques have been utilised in a range of industries including healthcare, engineering, nuclear, transportation and business sector; each technique has varying uses within different disciplines.
This is a time based model that describes the probability of a system operator’s failure as a multiplicative function of 5 main factors. These factors are as follows:
Using these figures, an overall Human Error Probability (HEP) can be calculated with the formulation provided below:
K1 x K2 x K3 x K4 x K5
The specific value of each of the above functions can be obtained by consulting standard tables that take account of the method in which the HEP is derived.
Background.
Developed in 1980 by Bello and Colombari, TESEO created with the intention of using it for the purpose of conducting HRA of process industries. The methodology is relatively straightforward and is easy to use but is also limited; it is useful for quick overview HRA assessments, as opposed to highly detailed and in-depth assessments. Within the field of HRA, there is a lack of theoretical foundation for the technique, as is widely acknowledged throughout.
TESEO Methodology.
When putting this technique into practice, it is necessary for the designated HRA assessor to thoroughly consider the task requiring assessment and therefore also consider the value for Kn that applies in the context. Once this value has been decided upon, the tables, previously mentioned, are then consulted from which a related value for each of the identified factors is found to allow the HEP to be calculated.
Worked Example.
Provided below is an example of how TESEO methodology can be used in practice; each of the stages of the process described above are worked through in order.
Context.
An operator works on a production transfer line that operates between two tanks. His role is to ensure the correct product is selected for transfer from one tanker to the other by operating remotely located valves. The essential valves must be opened to perform the task.
The operator possesses average experience for this role. The individual is in a control room that has a relatively noisy environment and poor lighting. There is a time window of five minutes for the required task.
Method.
The figures for the HEP calculation, obtained from the relevant tables, are given as follows:
The calculation for the final HEP figure is therefore calculated as:
Result.
Given the result of this calculation, it can be deduced that were the control room notified of the valves’ positions and if the microclimate was better, K5 would be unity, and therefore the HEP would be 0.005, representing an improvement of 1 order of magnitude.
Advantages of TESEO.
The technique of TESEO is typically quick and straightforward in comparison to other HRA tools, not only in producing a final result, but also in sensitivity analysis e.g., it is useful in identifying the effects improvements in human factors have on overall human reliability of a task. It is widely applicable to various control room designs or with procedures with varying characteristics.
Disadvantages of TESEO.
There is limited work published with regards to the theoretical foundations of this technique, in particular relating to the justification of the five factor methodology. Regardless of the situation, it remains to be assumed that these 5 factors are suffice for an accurate assessment of human performance; as no other factors are considered, this suggests that to solely use these 5 factors to adequately describe the full range of error producing conditions fails to be highly realistic. Further to this, the values of K1-5 are unsubstantiated and the suggested multiplicative relationship has no sufficient theoretical or empirical evidence for justification purposes.

The Museum of Innocence

The Museum of Innocence () is a novel by Orhan Pamuk, Nobel-laureate Turkish novelist published on August 29, 2008. The book is an account of love between a wealthy businessman Kemal and a poorer distant relation Füsun during the period 1975 to 1984 in Istanbul. Kemal’s engagement to a pretty girl Sibel is in two months time when he meets shop girl Füsun while buying a handbag for his fiancee. What follows in next month and a half is an intense and secretive physical and emotional relation between them, portrayed beautifully. Kemal’s happiest moment of life comes while making love the day Füsun confesses her deep love for him. Though it is clear that he has also fallen completely for Füsun, Kemal keeps denying this to himself, believing that his marriage with Sibel and secret relationship could continue forever. His reverie is broken when Füsun disappears just after attending his engagement. Now he has to come to terms with his deep attachment and love for Füsun. He goes through a very painful period for around a year, unable to meet Füsun and deriving consolation from objects and place related to his beloved and their lovemaking. His engagement to Sibel breaks and finally Füsun responds to his letter and agrees to meet him. Füsun has got married, living with her husband and parents and pretends to meet Kemal just as a distant relation, with undercurrents of anger. Next eight years Kemal keeps visiting the family for supper and expressing his love for Füsun in various ways, also finding consolation in various objects related to her which he carries away from the house. Finally after her father’s death, circumstances lead to divorce of Füsun and her husband. Füsun and Kemal are to be married after a trip around Europe together, but fate has something else in store altogether and they get separated for life after a night of intense love making. Kemal regards each object related to Füsun and their love, collected over the years, as portraying some discrete moment of happiness and bliss in the passage of those nine years. He decides to convert the Füsun’s house into a museum of innocence, including all these objects and also other memorabilia related to the period.  
Pamuk said he used YouTube to research Turkish music and film while preparing the novel. 
In the writing of this book, Pamuk was influenced by the Bagatti Valsecchi Museum in Milan, Italy, as he noted in the museum's guestbook on June 27, 2007: “It is the third time that I have visited this extraordinary museum. I love this house, the idea and the imagination that hide behind these walls. They influenced me a lot for the novel I am writing, "The Museum of Innocence". I am happy to be here for the third time.”
An excerpt, entitled Distant Relations appeared in The New Yorker on September 7, 2009.
The English translation, by his long-time collaborator Maureen Freely, was released on October 20, 2009 by Alfred A. Knopf.
An actual museum.
Pamuk has established an actual "Museum of Innocence", based on the museum described in the book. It is housed in a building in the Çukurcuma neighbourhood of Beyoğlu, Istanbul, and displays a collection evocative of everyday life and culture of Istanbul during the period in which the novel is set. Originally, the museum was scheduled to be exhibited at Frankfurt’s Schirn Kunsthalle in October 2008, during the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, but the exhibition was cancelled. In 2010, Pamuk still hoped that the museum would be opened in 2011. After much delay, the museum was finally inaugurated in April 2012. Although created later, the museum and the novel were conceived of in tandem, displaying the obsessive romance between two Istanbul families, as well as eternalizing a perspective on upper-class Istanbul in the 1970s. The project was supported by Istanbul 2010 – European Capital of Culture. According to the book, the museum allows free entry to those who bring a copy of the book. A ticket placed in the 83rd chapter of the book will be stamped before ushering the reader in.

Landscape mythology

Landscape mythology and anthropology of landscape ("Landschaftsmythologie", "Landschaftsethnologie") are terms for a field of study advocated since about 1990 by Kurt Derungs (born 1962 in St. Gallen, Switzerland). Derungs describes the field as an interdisciplinary approach to landscape combining archaeology, ethnology and mythology. 
Derungs interprets landscape features in terms of "totemism, shamanism and matriarchal mythology", claiming that his approach qualifies as neither esotericism nor as positivism but as a "sound alternative" to both. His interpretations are strongly influenced by the hypothesis of a matriarchal structure of society and a cult of the Great Goddess in Neolithic Europe, and he associates megalithic monuments and elements of traditional fairy tales with these ideas.
Since 1994, Derungs manages the "edition amalia" publishing house, where his books appear besides publications on related topics (matriarchy, Great Goddess) by other authors. Derungs is popular in German Neopagan circles, but has received little attention in academic literature.

Politics of Umbria

The Politics of Umbria, one of the twenty regions of Italy, takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of the Region is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Legislative power is vested in the Regional Council of Umbria, while executive power is exercised by the Regional Cabinet led by the President, who is directly elected by the people. The current Statute is in force since 2005. 
After World War II Umbria became a stronghold of the Italian Communist Party and of its successors: the Democratic Party of the Left, the Democrats of the Left and finally the Democratic Party.
Legislative branch.
The Regional Council of Umbria ("Consiglio Regionale dell'Umbria") is composed of 30 members. 24 councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 6 councillors (elected in bloc) come from a "regional list", including the President-elect. One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second. If a coalition wins more than 50% of the total seats in the Council with PR, only 3 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 26. If the winning coalition receives less than 40% of votes special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.
The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the "simul stabunt, simul cadent" prevision introduced in 1999 (literally "they will stand together or they will fall together"), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.
Executive branch.
The Regional Government ("Giunta Regionale") is presided by the President of the Region ("Presidente della Regione"), who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed by the President and the members ("Assessori"), who are currently 9, including a Vice President.
Local government.
Provinces.
Umbria is divided in two provinces, which have been a traditional heartland of the left, from the Italian Communist Party to the current Democratic Party.
Municipalities.
Umbria is also divided in 92 "comuni" (municipalities), most of which were established in the Middle Ages. A large majority of them are controlled by the Democratic Party.
Parties and elections.
Last regional election.
In the last regional election, which took place on 28–29 March 2010, Catiuscia Marini (Democratic Party) defeated Fiammetta Modena (The People of Freedom) by a landslide.

HBV RNA encapsidation signal epsilon

The HBV RNA encapsidation signal epsilon (HBV_epsilon) is an element essential for HBV virus replication.
It is an RNA structure situated near the 5' end of the HBV pregenomic RNA. 
The structure consists of a lower stem, a bulge region, an upper stem and a tri-loop.
The structure was determined and refined through enzymatic probing and NMR spectroscopy. 
The closure of the tri-loop was not predicted by RNA structure prediction programs but observed in the NMR structure. 
The regions shown to be critical for encapsidation of the RNA in the viral lifecycle are the bulge, upper stem and tri-loop which interact with the terminal protein domain of the HBV viral polymerase.

Claud Morris

Claud Morris (20 January 1920 – 21 May 2000) was a British newspaper owner who sought to make peace between Arabs and Israelis.
Family and education.
Born at Angwinnick, Ludgvan, near Penzance, Cornwall, he became a junior reporter to "The Cornishman" at the age of nine. He had to leave school after failing the Cornwall Schools examination and went to work at nearby Collurian Farm which sold butter to Harrods. He first saw his wife while having a meal in London in the autumn of 1948. When asked who he would marry he pointed to Patricia Holton, an American writer and broadcaster, who he had never seen before and replied ″That one there″. Morris followed her to America and they married in January 1949.
He died in the cottage he was born in, after a series of strokes and survived by his wife, a son, William and two daughters.
Career.
Leaving Collurian he workded as a porter at Penzance railway station for the Great Western Railway and with the free pass, that was part of his entitlement, he travelled to London to search for a post as a journalist. He landed his first job with "The Dairy Farmer" and later "Farmers Weekly". He travelled to the West Indies in 1939 and Canada where he joined the Canadian Army at the outbreak of World War II, but was invalided out in 1941. Back in Britain, he started as a sub-editor on the "Daily Express", and later as a personal assistant to Manny Shinwell, a Labour MP, writing speeches for members of the party. In 1949 he became political columnist for the "Daily Mirror", and unsuccessfully standing as a Labour party candidate for Bristol West in 1950 and 1951.
In 1952, he bought a small South Wales newspaper, more than doubling its circulation in three years. After an abortive alliance with Roy Thomson to buy "The Times" in 1966, he continued building up his own publishing empire until 1970, when his printing works were firebombed after printing several issues of "Free Palestinian", a newspaper funded by Yasser Arafat. The attack caused Morris to become an advocate of the Arab cause, joining forces with Christopher Mayhew, MP to produce a new magazine "Middle East International". After Mayhew vetoed an article Morris wrote for publication, Morris published it in one of his own newspapers. This led to the resignation of key staff and a boycott by advertisers, causing the collapse of the paper.
Morris founded another newspaper, "Voice of the Arab World" and spent much of the next few decades travelling the Middle East. By the late 1980s, Morris had become convinced of the need to find a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and in 1989 helped establish the Next Century Foundation.
He wrote a two-volume autobiography -"I Bought a Newspaper" (1963) and "The Last Inch: a Middle East Odyssey" (1997).

Sleeper attended grammar, or perhaps high school, at The Old Academy, located on West 2nd Street between Fulton and Franklin Streets in Chester.
Sleeper became well known in Delaware County. In the 1890s, he had at least partial control of a baseball team in Marcus Hook, some three miles southwest of Chester. He brought the team to Chester's 12th Street Park, which was bounded by 12th, Upland and Potter Streets. He eventually passed control of the team to local baseball impresario Jesse Frysinger, and it moved in 1900 to Wilmington, Delaware.
In October 1921, Sleeper bought part of the "Brow O' the Hill" estate at 8 Irving Road, Wallingford, Pennsylvania, from D. Edwin Irving for $4,250. He acquired the rest on March 18, 1930, from Samuel Lloyd Irving and his wife and Jeanette Irving Stull and her husband.
Sleeper died August 20, 1946. His will allowed his sister, Lottie Sleeper Hill, to live in "Brow O’ the Hill" until her death.

The Far-Western Development Region (Nepali: सुदुर पश्चिमाञ्चल विकास क्षेत्र, "Sudur Pashchimānchal Bikās Kshetra") is one of Nepal's five development regions. It is located at the western end of the country with headquarters at Dipayal.
It comprises two zones:
The Far Western Region of Nepal is sometimes called the Doti region, which some believe originated from 'Dovati' meaning land between two rivers. Others believe it originated from the Hindu god Dev, and aatavi, meaning the place of re-creation. The area's history goes back to the 13th century when Niranjan Malldeo founded the Doti Kingdom following the fall of the Katyuri Kings. Dotiyali and Kumauni is spoken in the Far Western Region. Deuda,Jhoda, Chhpeli, Chhaliya, Bhada etc. are traditional dance of the region and Gaura or Gamara is the biggest festival of the region.
History.
doti was an ancient kingdom of uttrakhand of India and far western region of Nepal which was formed after disintegration of Katyuri kingdom of Uttarakhand and far western region of Nepal during 13th century. Doti was one of eight different princely states formed after the kingdom broken and others were 1.Baijnath-Katyuri, 2.Dwarahat, 3. Doti, 4. Baramandal, 5.Askot, 6. Sira, 7. Sora, 8. Sui (Kali kumaon). Kingdom had broken down because of the invasion of. Khas kings Ashoka challa and Krachalla from Karnali Zone (Dullu) of Nepal in 1191 and 1223 respectively'. Later on, the whole land between Ramganga on the west (Uttarakhand) and the Karnali on the east (which divides far western region to other part Nepal) came under Raikas after the origin of Raikas of Katyuris in Doti. "Brahma Dev Mandi" at Kanchanpur District of Mahakali Zone was established by Katyuri king Brahma Dev.
Raikas of Doti.
Niranjan Malla Dev was the founder of Doti Kingdom around 13th century after a fall of Katyuris Kingdom. He was the son of Last Katyuris of united Katyuris kingdom. Kings of Doti were known as Raikas (also known as Rainka Maharaj). Later on Raikas, after overthrow Khas Malla of Karnali Zone, were able to form a strong Raikas Kingdom in Far Western Region and Kumaun which was called Doti. So far, the historical evidence of following Raikas have been discovered;
Niranjan Malla Dev (Founder of Doti Kingdom), Nagi Malla (1238), Ripu Malla (1279), Nirai Pal (1353 may be of Askot and his historical evidence of 1354 AD has been found in Almoda), Nag Malla (1384), Dhir Malla (1400), Ripu Malla (1410), Anand Malla (1430), Balinarayan Malla ("not known"), Sansar Malla (1442), Kalyan Malla (1443), Suratan Malla (1478), Kriti Malla (1482), Prithivi Malla (1488), Medini Jay Malla (1512), Ashok Malla (1517), Raj Malla (1539), Arjun Malla/Sahi (not known but he was ruling Sira as Malla and Doti as Shahi), Bhupati Malla/Shahi (1558), Sagaram Shahi (1567), Hari Malla/Shahi (1581 Last Raikas King of Sira and adjoining part of Nepal), Rudra Shahi (1630), Vikram Shahi (1642), Mandhata Shahi (1671), Raghunath Shahi (1690), Hari Shahi (1720), Krishna Shahi (1760), Deep Shahi (1785), Prithivi pati Shahi (1790, 'he had fought against Nepali Ruler (Gorkhali Ruler) with British in 1814 A.D').
The Historic place of War between Doti Kingdom and Nepal (Gorkha kingdom) during period of Gorkha Expansion at 1790, according to the history of Nepal, is NARI-DANG which is at the bank of Seti River and the Dumrakot was the base of Doti Kingdom for fighting against Gorkhali.
Mogul invasion over Raikas Kingdom.
During a period of Akbar 16th century Moguls had attacked over Raikas of Doti. They invaded Ajemru, capital of Raikas Kingdom. Ajemeru is now at Dadeldhura District of far western region of Nepal. Hussain Khan named army chief of Akbar residing at Lakhnow had led the attack. According to Abd-ul-Qadir Bada'uni (c. 1540 – 1615), Indo-Persian historian during Mughal Empire, Mugal Army chief of lukhnow Hussian Khan, lured by wealth and treasury of the state of the raikas, wanted to plunder sate was the motive behind the assault ; But they did not succeed.
Major cities.
Dhangadhi municipality is in Kailali District of Seti Zone.
Mahendranagar is the headquarters of Kanchanpur District in Mahakali Zone. It is located on the Mahakali River, 6 km north of the India border. Kanchanpur is inhabited by people of various races, including the indigenous Tharu people.

Noted for rolling forests and plateaus, the park has a great variety of vegetation as well as leopard, yellow-throated marten, tahr, Impeyan pheasant, chkor partridge, monal, griffin, red and yellow-billed blue magpie, and kalij pheasant. The park also has a number of butterflies and moths. The Ashram of Khaptad Swami is at the center of this park. Because the park has religious significance, drinking, smoking and violence are prohibited.
Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve is in the Terai, mainly in Kanchanpupr District. There are an estimated 2,000 to 2,500 swamp deer. The reserve is also home to the rare Bengal florican. Reptiles include Marsh muggers, Indian python, monitor lizards, cobras, rat snakes and kraits but these are seldom seen.
Royal Bardia National Park is the largest and most undisturbed wild area of the Terai. Similar to Chitwan but drier and more remote, it encompasses 1,000 square km of riverine grassland and sal forests. Bardia has the country's second largest tiger population, plus blackbuck antelopes, a few wild elephants, Gharial crocodiles, birds and mammals, and some rare Gangetic dolphins in the Karnali River on its western border.
Remains of Ancient culture – The Raute tribe in this region still lives by hunting and gathering, moving from place to place. They say they are owners of the forest, and government should not interfere their wild kingdom. Unique Tharu culture in the Terai, Hindu culture in mid-mountains and Tibetan culture in the northern part of the Far-Western Region can be seen and experienced.
Physical, the far western development region is also divided into 3 physical regions: Terai in the south, the hill in the middle and the mountains in the north. Mountain regions have many high mountain peaks. They are: Mt.Api, Saipal, Nampa, Yokapahad and Lasa.

Jonathan Romain

The Rabbi Dr Jonathan Anidjar Romain MBE (born Hampstead, London, England, 24 August 1954) is a writer and broadcaster and minister of Maidenhead Synagogue in Berkshire, England. He has a Ph.D. in the history of British Jewry. He writes for "The Times," "The Independent","The Guardian" and "The Jewish Chronicle" and appears on radio and television. He chaired the Movement for Reform Judaism's Assembly of Rabbis from 2007 to 2009.
He is chaplain to the Jewish Police Association, a board member of the Three Faiths Forum, a patron of Dignity in Dying, and for several years was one of the judges for both "The Times" Preacher of the Year competition and the BBC’s Frank Gillard Awards for religious programmes. He also chairs the Accord Coalition, which he helped found as an alliance of religious and non-religious groups committed to campaigning against religious discrimination in state-funded faith schools.
Romain's perspective on same-sex marriage is that marriage should be open to all. He argues that "anyone who takes sacred religious texts literally needs to move on with the times... The Bible is not the literal word of God, but the inspiration of God, as perceived by people of that era and subject to the limitations of the period. It therefore has to constantly adapt according to new knowledge and new insights."
In 2013 Romain launched a campaign for recognition of Judaism in China.
Honours.
In 2003, he was appointed MBE for his pioneering work in helping mixed-faith couples nationally, a theme covered in his book "Till Faith Us Do Part" (HarperCollins).
Personal life.
He is married to Sybil Sheridan, Rabbi of Wimbledon and District Synagogue, and they have four children together.

My Zinc Bed (television film)

My Zinc Bed is a 2008 TV Drama directed by Anthony Page and based on the stage play of the same name by David Hare. It was commissioned by the BBC and produced in association with HBO Films.
Plot.
The one-off drama follows Alcoholics Anonymous member Paul Peplow (Paddy Considine) who is sent to interview wealthy businessman Victor Quinn (Jonathan Pryce). Victor's obsession with addiction soon makes sense when Paul meets Victor's beautiful wife Elsa (Uma Thurman) – who reveals that she herself is a recovering alcoholic.
Locations.
The film is shot in many locations across London, including the now-standard "crossing the Thames" introductory shot backdropped by St. Paul's Cathedral and the 30 St Mary Axe Swiss Re office building (commonly referred to as "The Gherkin"). The Quinn's new residence is shown to be in the locale of the real Regent's Park.
Reception.
Critical.
The drama was well received by some critics, mostly overcoming the distraction of its high-powered cast. It was both commended and criticized for its retention of its stage-play roots.
Ratings.
The drama was seen by around 1 million viewers, considered poor ratings, especially given Thurman's involvement.

Porno para Ricardo

Porno para Ricardo () is a Cuban punk rock band founded in 1998. It is considered to be one of the most visible examples of young Cubans disagreement with the Castro's regime.
Their lyrics are mostly about politics and contemporary Cuban society, and are harshly critical of the Cuban government. Their lyrics are frequently very explicit and strongly critical of Castro and the regime itself. 
The band was originally well received by the Cuban cultural scene. However in 2003 Gorki Águila, the leader of the band, was arrested under drugs charges at a music festival in Pinar del Rio. He was imprisoned for 4 years only to be released after serving 2 years in prison. After his release, his lyrics became increasingly political. In March 2004 Gorki was nominated for the British Index on Censorship prize in the category "Music". The critical stance of the group against the regime accelerated only to be prohibited and their website cancelled the same year. 
In August 2008 Águila was arrested by the Cuban police with the charge of dangerousness, which allows them to detain people whom they think they are likely to commit crimes. The charge carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. He was eventually ordered to pay a $30 fine (2 months salary) for the lesser offense of public disorder, after prosecutors dropped the more serious charge following intense international pressure after broad media coverage. This is an unprecedented event in Cuban jurisprudence; the communist government is usually strict about punishment given to independent journalists and other dissident voices.
The group organizes a small recording studio for other prohibited groups that cannot play in Cuba called Paja Recolds.
2011 - Concert in Prague.
In 2011 the group held its first concert abroad at the United Islands Festival in Prague. However, the members of the group were prohibited to travel from Cuba (did not receive exit permit). Only Gorki Águila could participate at the festival due to his temporary stay with his mother in Mexico at the time of invitation. The rest of the band was complemented by Alaverdi, a Prague-based band of Lithuanian origins.

Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction

Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) is a technique used in the field of Human reliability Assessment (HRA), for the purposes of evaluating the probability of a human error occurring throughout the completion of a specific task. From such analyses measures can then be taken to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring within a system and therefore lead to an improvement in the overall levels of safety. There exist three primary reasons for conducting an HRA; error identification, error quantification and error reduction. As there exist a number of techniques used for such purposes, they can be split into one of two classifications; first generation techniques and second generation techniques. First generation techniques work on the basis of the simple dichotomy of ‘fits/doesn’t fit’ in the matching of the error situation in context with related error identification and quantification and second generation techniques are more theory based in their assessment and quantification of errors. ‘HRA techniques have been utilised in a range of industries including healthcare, engineering, nuclear, transportation and business sector; each technique has varying uses within different disciplines.
THERP models Human Error Probabilities (HEPs) using a fault-tree approach, in a similar way to an engineering risk assessment, but also accounts for performance shaping factors (PSFs) that may influence these probabilities. The probabilities for the human reliability analysis event tree (HRAET), which is the primary tool for assessment, are nominally calculated from the database developed by the authors Swain and Guttman; local data e.g. from simulators or accident reports may however be used instead. The resultant tree portrays a step by step account of the stages involved in a task, in a logical order. The technique is known as a total methodology as it simultaneously manages a number of different activities including task analysis, error identification, representation in form of HRAET and HEP quantification.
Background.
The Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) is a first generation methodology, which means that its procedures follow the way conventional reliability analysis models a machine. The technique was developed in the Sandia Laboratories for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission [2. Its primary author is Swain, who developed the THERP methodology gradually over a lengthy period of time. . THERP relies on a large human reliability database that contains HEPs, and is based upon both plant data and expert judgments. The technique was the first approach in HRA to come into broad use and is still widely used in a range of applications even beyond its original nuclear setting.
THERP Methodology.
The methodology for the THERP technique is broken down into 5 main stages:
1. "Define the system failures of interest"
These failures include functions of the system where human error has a greater likelihood of influencing the probability of a fault, and those of interest to the risk assessor; operations in which there may be no interest include those not operationally critical or those for which there already exist safety counter measures.
2. "List and analyse the related human operations, and identify human errors that can occur and relevant human error recovery modes"
This stage of the process necessitates a comprehensive task and human error analysis. The task analysis lists and sequences the discrete elements and information required by task operators. For each step of the task, possible errors are considered by the analyst and precisely defined. The possible errors are then considered by the analyst, for each task step. Such errors can be broken down into the following categories:
The opportunity for error recovery must also be considered as this, if achieved, has the potential to drastically reduce error probability for a task.
The tasks and associated outcomes are input to an HRAET in order to provide a graphical representation of a task’s procedure. The trees’ compatibility with conventional event-tree methodology i.e. including binary decision points at the end of each node, allows it to be evaluated mathematically.
An event tree visually displays all events that occur within a system. It starts off with an initiating event, then branches develop as various consequences of the starting event. These are represented in a number of different paths, each associated with a probability of occurrence. As mentioned previously, the tree works on a binary logic, so each event either succeeds or fails. With the addition of the probabilities for the individual events along each path, i.e., branches, the likelihood of the various outcomes can be found. Below is an example of an event tree that represents a system fire:
Therefore, under the condition that all of a task’s sub-tasks are fully represented within a HRAET, and the failure probability for each sub-task is known, this makes it possible to calculate the final reliability for the task.
3. "Estimate the relevant error probabilities"
HEPs for each sub-task are entered into the tree; it is necessary for all failure branches to have a probability otherwise the system will fail to provide a final answer. HRAETs provide the function of breaking down the primary operator tasks into finer steps, which are represented in the form of successes and failures. This tree indicates the order in which the events occur and also considers likely failures that may occur at each of the represented branches. The degree to which each high level task is broken down into lower level tasks is dependent on the availability of HEPs for the successive individual branches. The HEPs may be derived from a range of sources such as: the THERP database; simulation data; historical accident data; expert judgement. PSFs should be incorporated into these HEP calculations; the primary source of guidance for this is the THERP handbook. However the analyst must use their own discretion when deciding the extent to which each of the factors applies to the task
4. "Estimate the effects of human error on the system failure events"
With the completion of the HRA the human contribution to failure can then be assessed in comparison with the results of the overall reliability analysis. This can be completed by inserting the HEPs into the full system’s fault event tree, which allows human factors to be considered within the context of the full system.
5. "Recommend changes to the system and recalculate the system failure probabilities"
Once the human factor contribution is known, sensitivity analysis can be used to identify how certain risks may be improved in the reduction of HEPs. Error recovery paths may be incorporated into the event tree as this will aid the assessor when considering the possible approaches by which the identified errors can be reduced.
Worked Example.
"Context".
The following example illustrates how the THERP methodology can be used in practise in the calculation of Human Error Probabilities (HEPs). It is used to determine the HEP for establishing air based ventilation using emergency purge ventilation equipment on In-Tank Precipitation (ITP) processing tanks 48 and 49 after failure of the nitrogen purge system following a seismic event
"Assumptions".
In order for the final HEP calculation to be valid, the following assumptions require to be fulfilled:
Method.
An initial task analysis was carried out on the off normal procedure and standard operating procedure. This allowed for the operator to align and then initiate the emergency purge ventilation equipment given the loss of the ventilation system.
Thereafter, each individual task was analysed from which it was then possible to assign error probabilities and error factors to events that represented operator responses.
"HRA event tree for align and start emergency purge ventilation equipment on In-Tank Precipitation Tank 48 or 49 after a seismic event"
The summation of each of the failure path probabilities provided the total failure path probability (FT)
Results.
From the various figures and workings, it can be determined that the HEP for establishing air based ventilation using the emergency purge ventilation equipment on In-tank Precipitation processing tanks 48 and 49 after a failure of the nitrogen purge system following a seismic event is 4.2 E-6. This numerical value is judged to be a median value on the lognormal scale. However, it should be noted that this result is only valid given that all the previously stated assumptions are implemented.

Politics of Molise

The Politics of Molise, Italy takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the president of regional government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the regional government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.
Executive.
The regional government ("Giunta Regionale") is presided by the president of the region ("Presidente della Regione"), who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed by the president and the ministers ("Assessori"), who are currently 8.
Legislative branch.
The Regional Council of Molise ("Consiglio Regionale del Molise") is composed of 30 members. 24 councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 6 councillors (elected in bloc) come from a "regional list", including the president-elect. One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second. If a coalition wins more than 50% of the total seats in the council with PR, only 3 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 26. If the winning coalition receives less than 40% of votes special seats are added to the council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.
The council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the "simul stabunt, simul cadent" prevision introduced in 1999 (literally "they will stand together or they will fall together"), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.

Yalo

Yalo (, also transliterated Yalu) was a Palestinian Arab village located 13 kilometres southeast of Ramla. Identified by Edward Robinson as the ancient Canaanite and Israelite city of Aijalon, after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Jordan formally annexed Yalo along with the rest of the West Bank. Yalo's population increased dramatically owing to an influx of Palestinian refugees from neighbouring towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 war.
During the 1967 war, all the inhabitants of Yalo were expelled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the village was destroyed, and the area was occupied by Israel. Subsequently, with donations from Canadian benefactors, the Jewish National Fund built Canada Park, a recreational space, on the ruins of Yalo and three other neighbouring villages, Dayr Ayyub, Imwas and Bayt Nuba.
History.
In 1596, Yalo was a substantial village of 38 Muslim families.
During his travels in Palestine in 1838, Edward Robinson identified Yalo with Aijalon. Robinson relied upon the works of Jerome and Eusebius, who describe Aijalon as two Roman miles from Nicopolis, the descriptions of Aijalon in the Old Testament, and the philological similarities between the present-day Arabic name and its Canaanite root.
In "Later Biblical Researches in Palestine and Adjacent Regions" (1856), Edward Robinson and Eli Smith situate Yalo between two ravines, overlooking "the beautiful meadow-like tract of Merj Ibn 'Omeir." They note that a fountain from the western ravine served as a water source for the village, that the place has "an old appearance", and that on the cliff beyond the eastern ravine lay a series of large caverns. In these first-hand descriptions garnered from their travels in the region, they also write that, "The village belongs to the family of the Sheikhs Abu Ghaush, who reside at Kuriet al-'Enab. One of the younger of them was now here, and paid us a visit in our tent. The people of Yâlo were well disposed, and treated us respectfully."
1948 war.
In the lead up to the outbreak of 1948 Arab-Israeli war, on the night of 27 December 1947, the Etzioni Brigade of the Hagana blew up three houses in Yalo. This action formed part of a series what Benny Morris describes as "Haganah retaliatory strikes", the operational orders of which "almost invariably contained an order to blow up one or several houses (as well as to kill 'adult males' or 'armed irregulars')."
On 2 November 1950 Palestinian children were targeted by IDF when three Palestinian children were shot, two fatally by IDF troops near Dayr Ayyub in the Latrun salient. Ali Muhammad Ali Alyyan (12) his sister Fakhriyeh Muhammad Ali Alyyan (10) and their cousin Khadijeh Abd al Fattah Muhammad Ali (8) all from Yalo village, "The two children and Fakhriyeh were stood in a wadi bed and a soldier opened fire at them. According to both witnesses only one man fired at them with a sten-gun but none of the detachment attempted to interfere".
1967 war.
Israeli officials state that Yalo, Imwas and Beit Nuba were destroyed in the course of fighting that took place during the 1967 war. In June 1968, the Israeli embassy in Britain said that "these villages suffered heavy damage during the June war and its immediate aftermath, when our troops engaged two Egyptian Army commando units which had established themselves there and continued fighting after the war."
Tom Segev and Jessica Cohen write that, in 1967, Yalo was one of three populated villages in the Latrun area where residents were told to leave their homes and gather in an open area outside the villages, after which they were ordered over loudspeakers to march to Ramallah. Segev and Cohen estimate that about 8,000 people left as a result of that order. They also write that, "In the general order distributed to Central Command soldiers, Imwas and Yalu were associated with the failure to take the area in 1948 and were described as 'terms of disappointment, terms of a long and painful account, which has now been settled to the last cent.'"
Amos Kenan, an Israeli soldier present during the operation, gave a firsthand account of what happened to Yalo and its neighbouring villages. He said that, "The unit commander told us that it had been decided to blow up three villages in our sector; they were Beit Nuba, Imwas and Yalu ... In the houses we found one wounded Egyptian commando officer, and some very old people. At noon the first bulldozers arrived ..." The IDF used bulldozers and explosives to destroy 539 houses in Yalo. In "The Case for Palestine", John B. Quigley writes that, "The IDF blew up entire villages of Emmaus, Yalu, and Beit Nuba—near Jerusalem—and drove the villagers toward Jordan."
Meron Benvenisti explains that a week after their expulsion on June 7, 1967, thousands of refugees from the three villages tried to return home but "encountered army roadblocks that had been put up near the villages. From there they watched as bulldozers demolished their homes and the stones from the ruins were loaded on trucks belonging to Israeli contractors, who had bought them to use in building houses for Jews. The village sites, with their verdant orchards, were turned into a large picnic area and given the name Canada Park."
On June 21, 1967, Knesset member Tawfik Toubi requested that Defense Minister Moshe Dayan allow Yalo inhabitants to return to their village, but his request was denied. Since then, the village's evicted residents have campaigned for their return to and reconstruction of Yalo.
Post-2003 development.
Since 2003, the Israeli NGO Zochrot ('Remember' in Hebrew) has lobbied the Jewish National Fund for permission to post signs designating the Palestinian villages in Canada Park. After petitioning the Israeli High Court, permission was granted. However, subsequently the signs have been stolen or vandalized.
Artistic representations.
Palestinian artist Sliman Mansour made Yalo the subject of one of his paintings. The work, named for the village, was one of a series of four on destroyed Palestinian villages that he produced in 1988; the others being Bayt Dajan, Imwas and Yibna.
Demographics.
In 1922, at the beginning of British Mandate rule in Palestine, Yalo's population was 822. In 1931 the village's population increased to 963 people according to a census by British Mandatory authorities. In Sami Hadawi's 1945 land and population survey, its population was 1,220.

Mittersill castle

Mittersill Castle ("German" Schloss Mittersill) sits on the northern side of the Salzach valley some 140m above the city of Mittersill in the Pinzgau region in the Federal state of Salzburg, Austria.
History.
The area surrounding the castle have been settled since at least the last 4000 years, but the significance of the castle in trans-alpine traffic became especially important between the 10th to 14th centuries. 
The first records known of the castle date to the 12th century while Pinzgau was under the control of the Duchy of Bavaria, when the Counts of Lechsgemünd (subsequently: Mittersill) decided to establish their family seat there. The site had been chosen on the northern side of the Salzach river because of its ideal location in not only being able to control merchant traffic from Pass Thurn but also that exiting from the southern Felber valley. The castle itself was built in a horseshoe-shape, with an opening to the east and a defensive wall to the south. 
In 1228 the fiefdom of Pinzgau came under the control of the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the castle was made the seat of the Archbishops in Upper Pinzgau, and was used as a regional court for almost the next 600 years, including persecutions and witch hunts in Pinzgau, that started in the 16th century and continued into the 18th century. In 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars the Regional Court was transformed into a k. u. k. District Court, and despite the abolition of the Archbishopric of Salzburg in 1806, clergy continued to reside in the castle until as late as 1850. 
During the German German Peasants' War of 1525-1526 the castle was plundered and burnt to the ground. Rebuilding of the castle started in 1537 at a cost of 2500 Guilder to give it the appearance that it bears today, with later rebuilding work in the 16th century made after further smaller fires in 1555 and 1597. Though the castle was rebuilt to incorporate already existing structural elements, it was enhanced by newer defensive technologies and more modern comforts. So it was that the west side was strengthened through addition of its two characteristic turrets. In the southern one, the so-called “Witches’ Tower”, a castle chapel was created on the upper floor. 
In 1880 the castle was auctioned off, for a price of 4000 Guilder to grain merchant Anton Hahn who himself sold the castle two years later to Countess Marie Larisch von Moennich who employed architect Carl Gangolf Kayser in making renovations to the building. Ownership changed several times in the years that followed, the appearance of its interior rooms changing with each passing resident. Mittersill Castle experienced a very glamorous period from 1935-67 under the leadership of Baron Hubert von Pantz. Notable guests during this period include Dutch Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard, the Shah of Persia, Clark Gable, Henry Ford, Bob Hope and Aristotle Onassis.
During this period the castle suffered further fire damage when in 1938 it was struck by lightning. 
During the Nazi period the castle was used as a State Institute think-tank for Inner Asia and as a sub-department of the "Ahnenerbe e.V." (a Nazi German think tank for Intellectual Ancient History). For a short time the castle was used as an outer command base for the Mauthausen Concentration Camp, and some female prisoners were brought here.
Today.
In 1967, Mittersill Castle was purchased by means of several donations, in order to be used as a centre for Christian student conferences by the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students and other Christian groups. 
In 2009, the Castle were bought by two local families, who opened a restaurant in 2010. Plans existing to turn the castle into a hotel, which is than open to the public. First Rooms were rented out in summer/winter 2011.

Marfa Vasilevna Sobakina ("Марфа Васильевна Собакина"; 1552–1571), was Tsaritsa of the Tsardom of Russia and was the third wife of Ivan the Terrible. The daughter of a Novgorod based merchant Vasiliy Sobakin, Marfa was selected by Ivan among 12 marriage finalists. A few days after her selection, Marfa began to succumb to a mysterious ailment. It was rumoured that she was unintentionally poisoned by her mother, who gave her a potion supposedly meant to increase her fertility. Despite rapidly losing weight and barely standing, Marfa was nonetheless married to Ivan on 28 October 1571 in Aleksandrovska Sloboda. Marfa died a few days later. Her death increased her husband's paranoia, because she died in what was meant to be an impregnable fortress filled with loyal subjects. Ivan, remembering the death of his first wife, immediately suspected poison and put to death many of his subjects, including Mikail Temjruk (brother to the Tzar's previous wife) who was impaled.

Klepon

Klepon (pronounced Klê-pon) is a traditional rice cake, popular in Indonesia and Malaysia. It is a boiled rice cake, stuffed with liquid gula jawa (palm sugar), and rolled in grated coconut. Klepon is green because it is flavored with a paste made from the pandan or dracaena plant whose leaves are used widely in South East Asian cooking. In other parts of Indonesia, such as in Sumatra and in neighboring Malaysia, klepon is called as "onde-onde". However, in Java "onde-onde" refers to the Chinese Jin deui, a rice cake ball coated with sesame seeds and filled with sweet greenbean paste. Although popular across Southeast Asia, klepon may have originated in Java.
Klepon, along with getuk and cenil, are often eaten as morning or afternoon snacks. One must take care when consuming klepon, because a freshly boiled one usually contains hot palm sugar liquid.
In the 1950s, klepon was introduced by Indo immigrants to the Netherlands and is readily available in Dutch or Chinese Indonesian restaurants and supermarkets throughout the country.

<doc id="19059158" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19059158" title="San La Muerte">
San La Muerte

San La Muerte (Saint Death) is a skeletal folk saint that is venerated in Paraguay, the Northeast of Argentina (mainly in the province of Corrientes but also in Misiones, Chaco and Formosa) and southern Brazil (specifically in the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul). As the result of internal migration in Argentina since the 1960s the veneration of San La Muerte has been extended to Greater Buenos Aires and the national prison system as well.
Saint Death is depicted as a male skeleton figure usually holding a scythe. Although the Catholic Church in Mexico has attacked the devotion of Saint Death as a tradition that mixes paganism with Christianity and is contrary to the Christian belief of Christ defeating death, many devotees consider the veneration of San La Muerte as being part of their Catholic faith.
Although the rituals connected to and powers ascribed to San La Muerte are very similar, San La Muerte should not be confused with the similar folk saint Santa Muerte that is venerated in Mexico and parts of the US, and is typically depicted as a female skeleton figure.
Origins.
San La Muerte is one of many folk saints venerated in the Guaraní language region that covers parts of Paraguay, north-eastern Argentina and southern Brazil. Others include San Biquicho, San Alejo and Santa Catalina. Other names for San La Muerte include Señor De La Muerte (Lord of Death), Señor De La Buena Muerte (Lord of the Good Death) or - mainly in Paraguay - San Esqueleto (Saint Skeleton). It is believed that San La Muerte was first venerated among the Guaraní Indians following the expulsion of their Jesuit missionaries in 1767, as a mixture of their previous beliefs and the newly imported Catholic faith. Some of the Guarani tribes worshiped the bones of ancestors demanding protection against natural phenomena and adverse spiritual forces, which converged with the Catholic tradition of considering the bones of saints as holy relics. However there is currently no authoritative account of the origins of the San La Muerte cult.
Practice.
To believers, San La Muerte exists within the context of the Catholic faith and is comparable to other purely supernatural beings such as archangels. The San La Muerte devotion involves prayers, rituals, and offerings, which are given directly to the saint in expectation of and tailored to the fulfillment of specific requests. Offerings can include (human) blood, alcoholic drinks, candles and other valuable objects. San La Muerte receives offerings in exchange for favors related to a wide range of personal problems; San La Muerte is said to help to restore love, health and fortune, to protect worshipers from witchcraft, to remove the evil eye and to grant good luck in gambling. In addition to these powers, which are commonly attributed to folk saints in general, San La Muerte is also said to be able to grant a number of requests that are connected to crime and violence. For instance, it is believed that the skeletal saint can bring death upon the enemies of his devotees, can keep people from being sent to prison and shorten prison terms of inmates and can help in the recovery of stolen and misappropriated items.
The San La Muerte devotion is characterized by a moral code that must be obeyed. In the devotion of San La Muerte devotees have numerous obligation towards the saint, which they must honor in exchange for his protection. While followers "request" favors from other saints they "demand" them from San La Muerte. Communication with San La Muerte takes place through prayers that are passed on between believers. The San La Muerte devotion is based on punishment and submission and to be granted a favor the saint sometimes must even be threatened. Commons threats involve hunger or banishment to an uninhabited place until the favor is granted. When graces are granted, the saint will be rewarded and fed but never fully, in order to increase the chances of him soon being willing to grant another grace. 
For most devotees San La Muerte offers personal and non-transferable protection that will only be accessible to others when - after the death of the original owner - he or she has acquired the sculpture. There are also intermediaries such as witch doctors and traditional healers who invoke San La Muerte's power on behalf of their clients, usually concealing the image from sight of their customers. In other cases San La Muerte is kept as a concealed household saint, extending his protection upon all family members with no distinction. A number of public altars that are devoted to San La Muerte can also be found. They are run by devotees acting as guardians of and caretakers for these altars. Some of these altars host public festivities on the 15th of August, San La Muerte's saint's day (Since San La Muerte is not included in the saint's calendar of the Catholic Church the date is somewhat contested and in some cases his saint's day is celebrated on the 13th of August).
Image.
The San La Muerte devotion is based on interactions between worshipers and the Saint Death represented by man-made sculptures. Individual sculptures are addressed as San La Muerte (because of their small size these San La Muerte sculptures may also colloquially be referred to as 'Santito' ('Small Saint'). The representation of San La Muerte varies according to the individual saint maker that has crafted him, however the classic figure is a human skeleton, standing, with simple, minimalistic features. The skeleton usually carries a scythe, in some cases with drops of blood on the edge. The same image can be dressed mostly in black and red cloths. Other representations include a standing skeletons without a scythe, sitting skeletons and skeletons in a coffin.
San La Muerte sculptures can be carved from wood, bones, metal (especially bullets) and usually stand between 3 and 15 centimeters tall. Increased powers are attributed to sculptures which are crafted from materials of significant origin, such as the last phalanx bone of the little finger, a bone from a dead baby, wood taken from a dead person's coffin, or a crucifix that belonged to someone recently deceased. Other more common raw materials include guaiac tree and cedar wood.
According to believers, a San La Muerte sculpture, in order to be able to grant favors, needs to be consecrated by a Catholic priest seven times. If the sculpture is carved out of the bone of a Catholic man it only needs to be consecrated five times (as the bone has already been consecrated twice). To get sculptures of San La Muerte blessed, worshipers resort to subterfuge by concealing a picture of San La Muerte underneath a picture of a conventional saint. When a priest blesses the regular saint picture, it is felt that San La Muerte underneath has also been blessed.
Aside from sculptures that are usually kept on an altar or at a fixed place in the house there are a range of personal forms of the ritual that entail representations of San La Muerte being worn on (in the form of amulets and tattoos) or in the body (in the form of carvings inserted under the skin of the worshiper). San La muerte tattoos, amulets and body insertions are believed to offer special protection from death, bodily harm and imprisonment. Among devotees, fired bullets, preferably those that have wounded or killed a Christian man, are regarded as the most powerful raw material for amulets. Other materials for amulets include (human) bone, silver and gold. Tattoos of San La Muerte exhibit a wide variety of styles. From rudimentary outlines to elaborate depictions of three dimensional figures. Images of San La Muerte are usually accompanied by partial or complete transcriptions of prayers to him.

The CSS "Alabama's" Gulf of Mexico Expeditionary Raid commenced shortly after the "Alabama" left Bermuda and the Atlantic coast and cruised south toward the island of Dominica in the Caribbean Sea near the Gulf of Mexico. The raid lasted from about the middle of November, 1862 to the end of January, 1863.
The primary area of operation during this expeditionary raid, was the southern seaboard of the United States starting from Dominica then ranging up along Cuba and to Galveston, Texas before finally heading south again toward Jamaica.
Raid overview.
The CSS "Alabama" worked its way down the east coast of Florida during the month of November to Martinique to rendezvous with her supply vessel, the CSS "Agrippina", and ran into the USS "San Jacinto", narrowly escaping the Union warship. The CSS "Alabama" then made her way to Texas to help defend the state from invasion from Gen. Banks Expedition, and fought the USS "Hatteras", before escaping to the South Atlantic.
From this raiding area off the coast of New England, the CSS "Alabama" made her way into the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico to continue her unhindered wrecking of enemy commerce along the North American coastline.

Wit and Wisdom of Discworld

The Wit and Wisdom of Discworld is an accessory book to the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. It is a compilation of quotes from all the Discworld novels, amassed and prefaced by Stephen Briggs.
The book consists of the very best quotes, ideas and one-liners from all books in the Discworld series. The book is organised sequentially, beginning with quotes from The Colour of Magic and ending with Making Money, with each book being organised as a chapter. For each novel, a short synopsis (often the blurb from the novel) is provided to 'set the scene'. Many of the quotes are presented in such a way that even a relative Discworld novice could see the humour, although some require some knowledge of the Discworld universe (and the many unique characters that populate it) in order to be understood.
The introduction to the book, written by Stephen Briggs, states:
"In producing this book, I have not tried to extract every single gag and witty exchange from the series. There are too many, and to do that, I might as well have tied a set of the novels up with string and added a tag: 'The Complete Wit of Pratchett'."
The cover of the book is presented as a sort of 'faux book of magic', as borrowed from the Unseen University library, complete with mystical runes, torn edges, and of course, coated in spiderwebs.

He was educated at George Watson's College, the University of Edinburgh, and Balliol College, Oxford, at which he took a second in Classical Moderations in 1902 and a second in Greats in 1904. He joined the Civil Service at the Admiralty in that year, but two years later transferred to the Home Office, serving successively as assistant private secretary to Home Secretary Reginald McKenna, secretary to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, and principal secretary to Permanent Secretary Sir Edward Troup. He also served as joint secretary to the Royal Commission on Mines and the Royal Commission on Metalliferous Mines and Quarries.
In 1917 he was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Ministry of National Service. After the end of the First World War in 1918 he became Secretary to the Ministry of Reconstruction and of the Demobilisation Section of the War Cabinet. In 1919 he was appointed Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, holding the post until 1935 when he was appointed Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, retiring in 1940.
Chrystal was also a writer, publishing a new translation of the "Meditations of Marcus Aurelius", the translation of the "Memoirs of Prince Chlodwig of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst", a translation of Julius Meier Graef's "Development of Modern Art", the "Life of William Robertson Smith", and a volume of Smith's lectures and essays.

Upeet

Upeet is a Tamil (specifically, Madras Bashai) term used by players of tops in Chennai (formerly Madras), Tamil Nadu. It refers to a smooth rope-aided action that transfers the spinning top from the ground to the player's open palm, while continuing to spin. It is considered to be a fairly advanced manoeuvre.
The Move.
The aim of upeet is to transport a spinning top from the ground to the player's open palm. Further, the top is supposed to continue spinning for a while on the palm, with the spinning axis in the vertical position.
The manoeuvre relies on the thread that was used to spin the top. This thread is looped around the top's tip and then tightened appropriately. In a deft move, the players lifts the rope and deposits the spinning top on his/her open palm.
Etymology.
The term is possibly derived, like several words in Madras Bashai, from English. 'Up' and 'it' are the possible constituent words - when said using the accent of the region, the 'i' syllable is frequently pronounced as 'ee' ('catch eet' for 'catch it', for instance). 'Up it' itself might have its origins in street cricket to indicate to a fielder that he/she must catch the ball before it pitches, and consequently get the batsperson out.
Cultural reference.
The term is used in a joke in the theatre drama 'Marriage made in Saloon'. The drama's storyline and script are by Crazy Mohan.

Human error assessment and reduction technique

Human error assessment and reduction technique (HEART) is a technique used in the field of human reliability assessment (HRA), for the purposes of evaluating the probability of a human error occurring throughout the completion of a specific task. From such analyses measures can then be taken to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring within a system and therefore lead to an improvement in the overall levels of safety. There exist three primary reasons for conducting an HRA; error identification, error quantification and error reduction. As there exist a number of techniques used for such purposes, they can be split into one of two classifications; first generation techniques and second generation techniques. First generation techniques work on the basis of the simple dichotomy of ‘fits/doesn’t fit’ in the matching of the error situation in context with related error identification and quantification and second generation techniques are more theory based in their assessment and quantification of errors. ‘HRA techniques have been utilised in a range of industries including healthcare, engineering, nuclear, transportation and business sector; each technique has varying uses within different disciplines.
HEART method is based upon the principle that every time a task is performed there is a possibility of failure and that the probability of this is affected by one or more Error Producing Conditions (EPCs) – for instance: distraction, tiredness, cramped conditions etc. – to varying degrees. Factors which have a significant effect on performance are of greatest interest. These conditions can then be applied to a “best-case-scenario” estimate of the failure probability under ideal conditions to then obtain a final error chance. This figure assists in communication of error chances with the wider risk analysis or safety case. By forcing consideration of the EPCs potentially affecting a given procedure, HEART also has the indirect effect of providing a range of suggestions as to how the reliability may therefore be improved (from an ergonomic standpoint) and hence minimising risk.
Background.
HEART was developed by Williams in 1986. It is a first generation HRA technique, yet it is dissimilar to many of its contemporaries in that it remains to be widely used throughout the UK. The method essentially takes into consideration all factors which may negatively affect performance of a task in which human reliability is considered to be dependent, and each of these factors is then independently quantified to obtain an overall Human Error Probability (HEP), the collective product of the factors.
HEART methodology.
1. The first stage of the process is to identify the full range of sub-tasks that a system operator would be required to complete within a given task. 
2. Once this task description has been constructed a nominal human unreliability score for the particular task is then determined, usually by consulting local experts. Based around this calculated point, a 5th – 95th percentile confidence range is established. 
3. The EPCs, which are apparent in the given situation and highly probable to have a negative effect on the outcome, are then considered and the extent to which each EPC applies to the task in question is discussed and agreed, again with local experts. As an EPC should never be considered beneficial to a task, it is calculated using the following formula: 
4. A final estimate of the HEP is then calculated, in determination of which the identified EPC’s play a large part.
Only those EPC’s which show much evidence with regards to their affect in the contextual situation should be used by the assessor.
Worked example.
Context.
A reliability engineer has the task of assessing the probability of a plant operator failing to carry out the task of isolating a plant bypass route as required by procedure. However, the operator is fairly inexperienced in fulfilling this task and therefore typically does not follow the correct procedure; the individual is therefore unaware of the hazards created when the task is carried out
Assumptions.
There are various assumptions that should be considered in the context of the situation: 
Method.
A representation of this situation using the HEART methodology would be done as follows:
From the relevant tables it can be established that the type of task in this situation is of the type (F) which is defined as ‘Restore or shift a system to original or new state following procedures, with some checking’. This task type has the proposed nominal human unreliability value of 0.003.
Other factors to be included in the calculation are provided in the table below:
Result.
The final calculation for the normal likelihood of failure can therefore be formulated as:

Nantymoel

Nantymoel (Nant-y-moel) (Welsh for "Stream from the bare mountain") is a village and includes the formerly separate village of Pricetown in the county borough of Bridgend, Wales on the River Ogmore, and is one of the constituent villages of the Ogmore Valley. It is bordered by the village of Wyndham to the south and by the Bwlch y Clawdd hill to the north.
As with the rest of the Ogmore Valley, it was mainly a farming community up until the middle of the 19th century when coal mining became widespread across South Wales. The last coal mine (Wyndham/Western Colliery) closed in 1983, resulting in high unemployment at that time. Most residents today now travel to Bridgend or other larger towns for work.
The primary school was one of the few in the whole valley that didn't close in July 2003 and merge with the new Ogmore Primary School. It was refurbished in 2002 to combine with the nursery school that had previously closed.
The A4061 road passes through the village and goes north over Bwlch y Clawdd where it links to Treorchy and the Rhondda Valley to the north and the A4107 that goes west. The Bwlch, and surrounding large hillsides, offers a far-reaching view of the surrounding countryside. On a clear day, it is possible to see South West England over the Bristol Channel to the south, and the Brecon Beacons mountain range to the north.

Gorki Águila

 
Gorki Águila (born November 11, 1968 in Havana) is a Cuban punk rock musician and dissident, who has publicly criticized communism. He is the leader of the Porno para Ricardo band.
Águila lives with his father in a small apartment in Marianao, where he also has been recording his songs with the band since they were forbidden to have concerts. His mother and sister live in Mexico. Águila has a 11-year old daughter, Gabriela.
Initially, his band was well received by the Cuban authorities, being even featured on television, but as his lyrics became bolder, he was banned from performing in public and the songs being put on the internet with help of a friend from abroad.
In 2003, Águila was jailed on drug charges after a policewoman posed as a fan and asked him for amphetamines, after which he gave her two pills. He argues this was entrapment and an attempt to silence him. After serving 4 and a half year in Cuba's 5½ Kilo Prison, Aguila became an even more outspoken critic of the Cuban government, his lyrics growing more political. In an interview with CNN in 2007, Aguila said that "Communism is a failure. A total failure. Please. Leftists of the world -- improve your capitalism." In an interview with exiled Cuban anarchists PPR described anarchism as being "very seductive."
In August 2008, Águila was arrested by the Cuban police with the charge of "dangerousness", which allows them to detain people whom they think they are likely to commit crimes. The charge carries a penalty of one up to four years in prison. Signs of a "dangerousness state" are habitual drunkness and anti-social behaviour. He was eventually ordered to pay a $30 fine for the lesser offence of public disorder, after prosecutors dropped the more serious charge.
In 2007 Gorki featured in the documentary Cuba RebelioN, a film by Alessio Cuomo and Sander de Nooij about Cuban underground rock musicians who rebel against the Castro-regime. It shows the painful reality of musicians who are not allowed to express themselves publicly but are nevertheless willing to put their freedom at risk by playing their music.

Nikon D90

The Nikon D90 is a 12.3 megapixel digital single-lens reflex camera model announced by Nikon on August 27, 2008. It is a prosumer model that replaces the Nikon D80, fitting between the company's entry-level and professional DSLR models. Nikon gives the D90's Estimated Selling Price in the United States as US$899.95 for the body alone and as $1299.99 with the Nikkor AF-S DX 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR, which by itself sells for $399.95. Street prices are generally lower.
The D90 was the first DSLR with video recording capabilities. In May 2009, the D90 won the TIPA European Photo & Imaging Award, in the "Best D-SLR Advanced" category.
Features.
Some of the improvements the D90 offers over the D80 include 12.3 megapixel resolution, extended light sensitivity capabilities, live view and automatic correction of lateral chromatic aberration. The D90 is the first DSLR to offer video recording, with the ability to record HD 720p videos, with mono sound, at 24 frames per second.
Unlike less expensive models such as the D40, D60, D3000 and D5000, the D90 has a built in autofocus motor, which means that all Nikon F-mount autofocus-lenses (except two for the rare Nikon F3AF) can be used in autofocus mode.
The Nikon D90 is the first Nikon camera to include a third firmware module, labeled "L," which provides an updateable lens distance integration database that improves autoexposure functions. Some of its accessories, such as the MB-D80 battery grip and ML-L3 wireless remote, are also compatible with its predecessor the D80. It was the first Nikon DSLR to support Global Positioning System integration for automatic location tagging of photographs, using a GPS receiver sold separately.
Video recording.
The D90 is the first DSLR with video recording capabilities; it can record 720p high-definition video with monaural sound. However, it does not auto-focus while filming video; to keep a subject in focus, the user must manually track subject motion. Soon after the D90's introduction, many new DSLRs from Nikon and other manufacturers began including video recording as a standard feature.
As with other DSLRs, the D90's CMOS sensor captures video frames using a rolling shutter, which may cause skewing artifacts during rapid camera or subject motion. Recorded videos are limited to a 2 GB file size and a duration of 5–20 minutes for each continuous clip, depending on resolution.
The first feature film shot with a D90 was "Reverie". Ray Mist, the film's cinematographer, praised the camera for its dynamic range, its ability to support 35 mm optics offering greater choices of focal length and depth of focus, and large sensor in comparison to standard video cameras within and beyond the D90's price range.
Reception.
The Nikon D90 has been tested by many independent reviewers since its introduction. Most reviews of the D90 have been positive, assessing the D90 as a notable improvement over its predecessor, the Nikon D80. The camera received 4 stars out of 5 in CNET's editor review and Photocrati's Nikon D90 review labeled the D90 a "best value" DSLR. Digital Photography Review also published a highly positive assessment, but noted that the only weakness seemed to be that matrix metering on the D90 is tied too strongly to individual focus points, and therefore allows highlights to be clipped in other areas of an image. In DxOmark's camera sensor RAW image ratings, the D90 achieved a score of 72.6, placing it above its competitors and more expensive cameras such as the Canon EOS 1D Mark III (71), Canon EOS 5D (70.9) and Nikon D300S (69.8). Statistics from Photo-sharing website Flickr also show that the D90 is ranked as the most used Nikon system in terms of picture uploads.
As noted above, one of the most notable features of the Nikon D90 is that it is the first digital SLR camera to include high definition video capabilities. While most reviewers gave the D90's HD video high marks, Nikon expert Thom Hogan noted that the HD video capability, while novel, was not yet refined, providing only mono sound, and being subject to video flaws such as apparent distorted motion of stationary objects when panning.

Marie Castello

Marie Castello (May 25, 1915 – June 27, 2008), who was known as Madam Marie, was an American fortune teller and psychic reader who worked on the Asbury Park, New Jersey, boardwalk from 1932 until 2008. Madam Marie was the longest running tenant on the Asbury Park boardwalk.
Castello was a fixture in Asbury Park for decades, telling fortunes on and off at her tiny booth on the boardwalk which is nicknamed The Temple of Knowledge. She read the fortunes of celebrities ranging from Judy Garland to Bruce Springsteen. According to accounts, Castello reportedly told Springsteen that he would be a huge success. Springsteen later jokes that she told all her musician clients the same thing.
Springsteen mentioned Castello in his 1973 song, "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)", which earned her a certain amount of fame among his fans. Springsteen wrote in the song's lyrics of Castello, "Did you hear the cops finally busted Madam Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do." Castello was never arrested during her career, according to Asbury Park deputy mayor Jim Bruno. Bruno added that, "...Springsteen turned her into an icon." Also in his song Brilliant Disguise, in writing about his failing first marriage he sings, "As we stood at the altar the gypsy swore our future was bright, but come the wee-wee hours maybe baby the gypsy lied". Springsteen reportedly never forgot Madam Marie and often visited her when he was back in Asbury Park. "He always comes by to say hello...He knows where he came from," Castello told the "Asbury Park Press" in a May 2008 interview with reporter Bill Handleman.
Biography.
Personal life.
Marie Castello was born in Neptune City, New Jersey, on May 25, 1915. Her Irish father made a living building "things" (in an exact quote from Castello), including pots, hand fans and baskets. Her mother was from Canada, while her maternal grandfather was originally from Australia. "Quite a combination, ain't it?" said Castello in a May 2008 interview while referring to her ethnic heritage.
Castello and her husband, Walter Castello, a car salesman, were married for over seventy years. The Castellos, who "married young," had four children and fourteen grandchildren. Walter Castello died in the late 1990s. Castello claimed that her family surname, "Castello", was the name given to her late husband's grandfather by American immigration officials when he passed through New York's Ellis Island from the Russian Empire during the 19th century. Castello was not sure what her family's name originally was.
Madam Marie.
Madam Marie began telling fortunes at her small, twelve square feet booth called the Temple of Knowledge in 1932. She, and her small stand, would remain a popular Asbury Park fixture on the city's boardwalk for much of the next seven decades. According to Castello, when she opened her business in the 1930s the Asbury Park boardwalk was a much more formal place than it became in later decades, "You couldn't walk on the boardwalk without shoes. You couldn't go on the boardwalk in a bathing suit. And there was never any drinking." At the time, many of her customers wore dresses, evening gowns and tuxedos to walk the boardwalk.
During the 1960s, Madam Marie became popularly known as "the gypsy queen of the boardwalk." Castello did not know why people began calling her gypsy, but reportedly did not mind the nickname as she felt that mystery was good for a fortunetelling business. The nickname became especially popular with locals, especially teens who worked in the area, such as a young Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen began visiting Madam Marie, as Castello was known on the boardwalk, around the age of 17, and often played his guitar outside of her booth. According to stories told by Springsteen, Castello predicted that he would be famous. She would later be immortalized in his 1973 song, "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)".
Castello gained a following among celebrities who often stopped at Asbury Park to perform at the nearby Asbury Park Convention Hall during her long career on the boardwalk, especially during the 1960s. Her famous clients included Ray Charles, Woody Allen, Perry Como, Diane Keaton, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, Elliott Gould, Gorilla Monsoon, Vic Damone and Diahann Carroll.
Castello continued to work on the boardwalk despite the decline of Asbury Park during the 1970s. She became one of the few businesses who remained on the boardwalk during the 1970s and 1980s as tourism in Asbury Park declined. She did not talk about the decline of Asbury Park during the 1970s stating, "It's something I want to forget," in a May 2008 interview.
Castello closed down her regular daily business on the boardwalk in 1997, which coincided with a decline in business in Asbury Park. She continued to read fortunes in nearby Ocean Township, New Jersey.
Return to Asbury Park.
Madam Marie returned to fortunetelling at her Temple of Knowledge in Asbury Park on July 4, 2004, after a seven year hiatus from the boardwalk, her longest absence since the 1930s. Her return coincided with renewed investment and a boom in new businesses in Asbury Park. She resumed giving fortune readings to customers on weekends only, charging between $5 and $35 for her predictions. Other family members worked the stand at other times, including her granddaughter, Sabrina.
Castello continued to work as a fortuneteller at her booth in Asbury Park until her death in 2008. She suffered from arthritis during her later years, which sometimes kept her away from her business. However, she remained mentally sharp throughout her life.
Death.
Marie Castello died unexpectedly on June 27, 2008, at the age of 93. According to Castello's great-granddaughter, Sally Castello, "She really wasn't sick. She just wasn't feeling well. She was very, very strong until the day she died." The American flag at the Convention Hall-Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park was lowered to half staff in her honor.
Bruce Springsteen dedicated the July 4, 2008 performance of "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" to Castello and subsequently issued memories and condolences on his website:
"Back in the day when I was a fixture on the Asbury Park boardwalk, I'd often stop and talk to Madam Marie as she sat on her folding chair outside the Temple of Knowledge. I'd sit across from her on the metal guard rail bordering the beach, and watched as she led the day trippers into the small back room where she would unlock a few of the mysteries of their future. She always told me mine looked pretty good — she was right. The world has lost enough mystery as it is — we need our fortunetellers. We send our condolences out to her family who've carried on her tradition. Over here on E Street, we will miss her."
Castello's family continues to give readings from Castello's booth on the Asbury Park boardwalk.
