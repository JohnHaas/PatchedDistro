Honda Civic (fourth generation)

For 1987, the Honda Civic was significantly redesigned with a global release in 1988. The suspension had a radical re-configuration with what Honda called "double-wishbone suspension" on all four corners, wheelbase was increased to 98.4 inches (250 cm), and the body was redesigned with a lower hood line and more glass, giving less drag. Rear suspension however is more accurately described as multi-link trailing arm suspension since the upper control arm only has a single anchor and there is toe control used on the main trailing arm.
Japan.
The base model of the fourth generation Civic had a 1.2 L SOHC, this single carbureted engine was not available for the Japanese and American markets. In Japan the base version received a 1.3 L SOHC single carbureted engine, thus equipped it was called either 23L or 23U.
The 1.5 L SOHC engine came in a wide variety of models, dual-point injection, single carbureted and dual carbureted. Those engines were available in the Japanese-market 25X and 25XT. The Japanese version of the sporting Si, initially the top version, featured a (ZC) D16A8/A9 1.6 L 16V DOHC engine.
But there was more to come, and in late 1989 the new top model of the hatchback was the new SiR, fitted with the 1.6-litre, at 7,600 rpm "B16A" DOHC VTEC engine. This, the first B engine, marked the introduction of Honda's variable valve timing and electronic lift control technology, or VTEC. By providing two different camshaft profiles—one for fuel economy, one for performance—the VTEC engines set a high-revving, naturally aspirated precedent for future performance variants of the Honda Civic. With its light weight, independent suspension and powerful engine, the car was well-received globally, receiving “Golden Steering Wheel Award” from the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, and ranking first in France’s "l’Automobile" magazine 1989 survey on car quality and reliability. The European model, badged as a "1.6i-VT", used a slightly less powerful B16A1 engine, which had an 8,200 rpm redline and made , although it made the same of torque as the Japanese market B16. In Japan, automatic-equipped SiR Civics also received the lower-powered engine.
The wagon, known in Japan as the Civic Shuttle, continued but the commercial-use "Shuttle Pro" was replaced by a dedicated commercial delivery van called the Honda Partner starting with model year 1996.
North America.
All United States vehicles were fuel injected.
In 1989 the Civic had a light facelift. Some things that changed were the front bumper design, the front corner lights no longer had the two screws on the outside, the gauge cluster cover shape slightly changed, tail light units design changed, side moldings became thinner, and most American Civics received automatic seat belts due to changes in federal highway safety law. The sedan and wagon featured powered automatic shoulder belts that retracted from the b-pillar to a position halfway down the a-pillar when the door was open, while the hatchback received a standard style shoulder and lap belt mechanism that was attached to the door and was intended to remain buckled at all times. While this setup did satisfy the federal regulations, the front doors had to be opened very wide to allow access between the belt and the seat. Many Civic owners used the door mounted belts just as they would pillar mounted belts, buckling and unbuckling as necessary.
Models Available.
STD.
The base model with the lowest price and lowest standard (vinyl seats) interior, instrumentation, engine output and transmission. It was only available as a Hatchback. Engine was D15B1 16V SOHC, with dual port throttle body injection, with restrictor on the tandem valve, and catalytic converter integrated into the exhaust manifold. Manual transmissions were 4-speed with cable operated clutch (5-speed in Canada). Automatic 4-speed transmission was also available.
DX.
Available as Hatchback, Sedan and Wagon, this had cloth seats, optional power steering, optional rear wash/wiper, optional clock, optional passenger door mirror and optional wheel covers. Engines were D15B2 16V SOHC with slightly higher output due to an improved profile on the inlet side of the Single Overhead Cam and unrestricted tandem valve. Manual transmissions came as 5-speed with cable operated clutch. Automatic transmission was available as an option.
LX.
Available only as a Sedan, this had a higher level interior with tachometer instrumentation, electric windows, electric door locks, electric door mirrors, clock and wheel covers as standard. Engines were D15B2 16V SOHC, same as the DX, with 5-speed cable clutch transmission. 4- speed automatic transmission was optional.
EX.
Available only as a Sedan for 1990 and 1991 model years, this was the top of the Civic line with the LX features,and a D16A6 16V SOHC engine with 4-point injection. It also had upgraded brakes on the front with 10.3" disks vs. the 9.5" on the STD, DX, LX and SI models. The 1991 had a higher geared steering rack - 3.1 turns lock to lock vs 4 for other and prior models.
SI.
Initially, the Civic Si hatchback was absent from the lineup, with only the CRX Si offered for the 1988 model year. That changed, however, for 1989, and the Civic Si hatchback was reintroduced, along with a 3-hp upgrade for the D16 engine across all Si trims (making 108 hp, 1988 CR-X Si 105 hp). This was the sportiest US market Civic, only available as a hatchback. The engine fitted was the D16A6 16-valve SOHC with 4-point injection and output of . It weighed in at , achieving a factory 0–60 mph of 8.1 seconds; and a quarter-mile time of 16.2 at .
The main standard features of the Si trim were the power sun roof/moon roof, tachometer, passenger door mirror, color matched bumpers, dash clock, larger exhaust, front and rear anti-roll bars, 14" steel wheels with covers, and slightly deeper bucket sport seats. There was no power steering and no automatic transmission available (except in Canada). Additional options were air conditioning and fog lights, as well as the different Honda Genuine Accessory alloy wheels. In other markets, more powerful D16A8 and D16A9 engines were used instead, which made and respectively.
Compared to the previous generation, the Civic Si saw an improvement in handling, in part due to the double-wishbone suspension at all four corners and lower wind drag due to the sleeker body shape. As with all other trims, the Civic Si received a slight visual upgrade in 1990, featuring revised bumpers and tail lights.
Due to the difference in engine output and modification potential between the American and JDM models, the second-generation Si sparked a popular trend of engine swapping, where tuners would replace the D-series power plant with a more powerful B-series motor.
Wagon.
This was available as FWD and RealTime4WD. The RT4WD versions featured the MPFI D16A6 engine paired with either a 6-speed manual (with a super-low gear left of first) or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The FWD versions featured the DPFI D15B2 engine paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. RT4WD wagons had white steel wheels with matching center caps. This bodystyle remained in production until February 21, 1996, when it was replaced by the Honda Orthia and professional use Honda Partner, sold only in Japan.
USDM Weights.
All weights listed in this table are in lbs. Air Conditioning added . Cargo capacity was an additional hatchback, sedan.
Europe.
For Europe the base model was the 1.3 L model, which was not available in the USA and Japan.. Next was a 1.4 L SOHC straight-four dual carbureted engine that was available only in 1988 and 1989; 1.5i GL and GLX models followed in 1990.
The European 1.6i GT and 1.6i-16 (depends on country) had a ZC like 1.6 L DOHC engine and produced 124 hp (D16Z5) or 130 hp (D16A9). In Europe the SiR was called 1.6i-VT and had a similar B16A1 engine. These top models were equipped with the VTEC system.
South Africa.
In South Africa, it was sold under the Honda Ballade branding.
Popularity.
Despite its sometime image as an economical vehicle, the fourth-generation hatchback has become very popular in near stock SCCA autocross competition. The EF chassis nearly dominates the Street touring category, attempting to compete with the Mazda MX-5 Miata. Fourth-generation Civic hatchbacks have also become nothing short of notorious among Honda Civic enthusiasts due to their lightweight design and formidable suspension layout which outperforms later generations.

Minion (cannon)

The minion (from the French word for cute) was a type of small cannon used during the Tudor period and into the late 17th century. The minion was of a small bore typically 3-inch (76.2mm) and fired a 5-pound cannonball. It saw action in the English Civil War as an antipersonnel weapon and was known as a Minion Drake, derived from either the Latin word for dragon or from the famous seafarer Sir Francis Drake. <br>
The minion constituted the main armament of the faster and more maneuverable Elizabethan galleons such as Drake's Golden Hind, along with the falconet. The supply ships that accompanied the Armada had similar guns, but the Spanish treasure fleet bringing gold back from the new world carried heavier armaments such as the demi-culverin and demi-cannon and relied on their size and weight in battle as they were purpose-built warships rather than merchant ships pressed into service. <br>
The Pilgrim Fathers brought a minion with them on the Mayflower, along with a saker and several smaller cannons. They later installed these in the fortified meeting-house Myles Standish built to defend the town from the French and Spanish. <br>
During the Age of Sail minions were used to repel boarding parties although larger caliber guns such as the carronade were becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to disable enemy vessels. Minions remained in service as man-of-war quarterdeck guns until 1716 when George I appointed Albert Bogard to redesign the Royal Navy's artillery.

In the New Old-Fashioned Way

In the New Old-Fashioned Way was the highly anticipated second album from Spongebath Records artists Fluid Ounces. The album was recorded in a marathon two week session with producer Richard Dortch in Jackson, Mississippi. All tracks were recorded live, with minimal overdubs. The album has a distinctive sound from other releases in the Ounces canon, and features mixing credits by Matt Mahaffey. The title of the album is the same as the last line of the chorus in the 1958 Brenda Lee song "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree".
Due to Spongebath's long delay in releasing the album, the band decided in the interim to release the "Vegetable Kingdom" EP, a five song teaser of new material and B-sides. The B-sides included the songs "Stick in the Mud," "Sitting Beside Myself," and "Sucker." The song "Vegetable Kingdom" became a minor radio hit regionally. The EP proved to be the perfect teaser for INOFW, showcasing the band's evolving sound and dense, distinctive arrangements.
Although the album sold poorly (largely due to limited distribution channels and limited pressings), it was received very well critically and is often considered one of the finest Tennessee rock albums of the 1990s. It was re-released by Avex Trax in Japan in May 2001.

<doc id="18957071" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18957071" title="Honda Civic (fifth generation)">
Honda Civic (fifth generation)

The fifth generation of the Honda Civic debuted in Japan on September 10, 1991. The new Civic was larger than its predecessor, had a more aerodynamic body and the wheelbase was increased to 257 cm (101.3 inches) for the three-door hatchback and 262 cm (103.2 inches) for the four-door sedan. The wagon was also dropped for overseas markets, while the previous generation station wagon ("Shuttle") continued in Japan. 
At its introduction in 1991, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award for the second time.
This generation of Civic used lightweight materials to create a fuel efficient economy car. Compared to the previous generation, the cowl was raised, which allowed for more suspension travel. Along with that change the ride became softer than that of the previous generation, which provided a more compliant ride at expense of crisper handling.
In addition, vehicles with the 1.6 L SOHC VTEC engines such as the Si hatchback and EX coupé models found in the United States, provoked popularity of the (relatively) high-performance 1.6 L inline-four segment. In South Africa a unique model with the B18B3 from the Acura Integra RS was specially built to fill the gap left by the absence of the DOHC B16A VTEC engine in the range.
Body styles.
Most Civic models are known to have certain rust spots. Most common ones for this generation are around the rear quarter panels, over the wheel wells. Other common rust spots include the front of the hood by the Honda logo, at the bottom of door frames, and on the chassis underneath the door frames. Rust spots are easy to fix, and improve the life of the body of the car. 
Coupé.
Trims available in the two-door coupé body style, introduced for 1993, were the DX (EJ2), EX, and EX-S (EJ1), for the United States Domestic Market (USDM), and the DX, DX "Special Edition" (EJ2), and Si (EJ1) for the Canadian Domestic Market (CDM). The coupé, built in both Canada and the United States, was also exported to European and Japanese markets. A left-hand drive version of the Civic Coupe was released as a limited edition in Japan, imported from the United States, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the "Honda Primo" dealer network in 1994.
DX: The DX was the base model equipped with all-manual features, driver's side door mirror, rear defroster and power brakes. The 1995 Canadian-only DX "Special Edition" added an AM/FM cassette player, wheelcovers, center armrest console, clock, power steering and dual manual mirrors.
EX/Si: The USDM EX/CDM Si included an AM/FM cassette player and upgraded sound system, cruise control, wheelcovers on wheels, clock, 9K tachometer with 7.2K RPM redline, moonroof with tilt feature, power steering, and dual body-coloured power mirrors and door handles. The USDM EX also received power locks and windows. Dual air bags and optional ABS with rear disc brakes distinguished the USDM 1993-only EX-S model.
Hatchback.
Introduced in 1992, trims available in the hatchback body style in the U.S. and Canada were the CX, DX, VX (EH2) and Si (EH3), however the VX and Si models were discontinued in Canada after model year 1993. With a total interior room (passenger and luggage) of 90 cu.ft., the hatchback was classified by EPA of U.S. as subcompact.
CX: The economical CX was the base model equipped with all-manual features, and power brakes. In the U.S., it came with the 8-valve 70 hp 1.5L D15B8 engine and manual transmission. With 42/48 miles per gallon (mpg) (city/hwy) ["revised to 2008 EPA rating: 35/43 mpg city/hwy"] or 40/47 mpg (city/hwy) ["revised to 2008 EPA rating: 33/42 mpg city/hwy"], the CX was the second most fuel-efficient Civic model of the fifth generation, after the VX. CX models in Canada came with the same 16-valve 102 hp 1.5L D15B7 engine as in the DX model, but could also be ordered with automatic transmission which also came with power steering. The 1995 CDM CX models (colloquially and/or unofficially known as the "CX-Plus") included from the factory a rear wiper, and could be ordered with side mouldings and manual passenger-side mirror.
VX: Fitted with the same manual transmission as the USDM CX, the VX was identical to the base model CX except that it gained improved fuel efficiency through a 92 hp 1.5 L (d15z1) VTEC-E engine yielding 48/55 mpg (city/hwy) ["revised to 2008 EPA rating: 39/49 mpg city/hwy"] or 44/51 mpg (city/hwy) ["revised to 2008 EPA rating: 36/46 mpg city/hwy"]. In Canada, it was rated by Transport Canada fuel consumption estimate: 4.7L/100 km city and 4.3L/100 km hwy. Other added features were an 8K tachometer with redline at 6K RPM, lightweight aluminum alloy wheels, as well as additional front & rear under-body trim additions to improve aerodynamic flow. The VX was also equipped with an aluminum alternator bracket, an aluminum front driver side engine mount, and a lightweight crank pulley. In addition, the instrument cluster featured a shift indicator light that would notify the driver when to shift upwards in order to achieve optimum mileage. To this day, the CX & VX models are lauded as one of the only gasoline-powered cars that rival the fuel economy of today's hybrids and diesels. In the March 2010 issue of "Car & Driver" for example, it mentions its long-term test car, a 2009 VW TDI Jetta with 6-speed dual-clutch auto transmission, got worse fuel mileage (38 mpg) than their 1992 Honda Civic VX test car (which got 41 mpg) and 2000 Honda Insight hybrid (48 mpg).
DX: The more powerful DX (pictured), with a 1.5 L D15B7 engine, manual passenger side mirror (after '92), tilt steering, intermittent wipers, side mouldings, rear wiper/washer, and rear cargo shelf as standard equipment. Despite the higher hp powerplant, the DX returns real-world mileage of 38 city / 45 hwy.
Si: The Si model replaced rear drum brakes with discs, added a power moonroof with tilt, cruise control, a dashboard clock, a 9K tachometer with a 7,200 rpm redline, plastic wheelcovers on 14 inch wheels, power side mirrors (body coloured, beginning in 1993), body-coloured door handles, and a 1.6 L single-overhead cam D16Z6 VTEC engine with manual transmission. It enabled the car to hit 0–60 in 7.5 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 16.3 at 86 mph. VTEC activated on the intake side and not the exhaust side, which was the result of the spark plug blocking the area where the cam follower would be. In 1994, rear speakers and optional ABS (the VIN# sequence will have "EH339", as opposed to the regular Si designation of "EH338") were also added.
In other markets (Japan, Peru) the Si received the 1.6 D16A9 DOHC non-VTEC engine, with . At this time, however, the Si was not the most powerful variant of the Civic sold elsewhere: In Europe, Honda also offered the Civic VTi, which featured a B16A2 engine, and the JDM SiR, SiR-II, and SiR-S carried an even more powerful B16A engine, which made . Japan also received a VTi model with a 1.5 litre engine similar to the D16Z6, with .
In European markets the trims available were the DX (EG3/1.3 L; 75 PS), LSi (EG4/1.5 L 90 PS), VEi (EG4/1.5 L SOHC VTEC-E 92 PS), ESi (EG5/1.6 L SOHC VTEC 125 PS), and VTi (EG6/1.6 L DOHC VTEC 160 PS)
Sedan.
Trims available in the USDM sedan body style were the DX, LX (EG8) and EX (EH9), while the CDM models were branded slightly differently as the LX, LX "Special Edition" (1994–95), EX (EG8) and the EX-V (1992–93) (EH9). In Japan, a four-door sedan was introduced called Honda Civic Ferio, sold at "Honda Primo" dealerships, while a more upscale version was called the Honda Domani sold at "Honda Clio". In Japan, the "Ferio" name was used from 1992 until 2006 on all sedans, regardless of trim packages installed.
The USDM DX/CDM LX was the base model, and equipped with all-manual features and power brakes. The Canadian-only LX "Special Edition" added an AM/FM cassette player, wheelcovers, center armrest console, clock, power steering, dual power mirrors and air conditioning. The USDM LX/CDM EX included an AM/FM cassette player, cruise control, center armrest console, clock, tachometer, power steering, and power windows, locks and mirrors. For 1994-95, the USDM LX had wheelcovers on wheels with 175/65 sized tires; in 1992-93, the wheels were with 175/70 tires. On the USDM EX/CDM EX-V, Honda added the VTEC engine, a power sunroof, body coloured mirrors (beginning 1993), rear sway bar, ABS, upgraded stereo and deluxe wheelcovers.
The four-door wagon was not updated for this generation platform, and continued to use the previous generation internationally until February 21, 1996, when it was replaced by the Honda Orthia and Honda Partner sold only in Japan.
Specifications.
North America.
All DX and LX models used the "D15B7" a 16-valve SOHC engine rated at and of torque. DX and LX models were aimed towards the economy conscious market. The USDM CX models had the "D15B8" which is an eight-valve non-VTEC engine rated at while the CDM models came with the D15B7. The VX had the "D15Z1" ("VTEC-E engine") capable of . The USDM EX, CDM EX-V, and the Si had the "D16Z6" SOHC VTEC engine (125 hp (93 kW)).
USDM Curb Weights.
All weights listed in this table are in lbs.
Other markets.
In Europe the DX has the D13B2 (hatchback EG3), the LSI has the D15B2 (hatchback EG4, sedan EG8) and D15B7 (coupé EJ2), the VEi has the D15Z1 VTEC-E (hatchback EG4 and sedan), the ESi has the D16Z6 (hatchback EG5 and sedan), and the VTi had the B16A2 (EG6/EG9).
In Japan, as well as a few other export locations, the VTi was offered with two different motors: the B16A2/3 (160 PS DOHC VTEC) and the D15B (130 PS SOHC VTEC). The D15B shares the same head as the US Civic Si (D16Z6) but features a unique block, crank, and rods. the car shared the 1.5 L displacement of the other D15 blocks, but the rods were the same length as the D16's (137mm) and a better rod to stroke ratio (1.63) rather than the normal D15's ratio of 1.59. Despite this, the crank and bearing sizes were not the same.
In the Middle East the EX has the D16Z9 (sedan EH5) and the VTi (hatchback & coupé, EJ2) has the B16A2\3 engine.

Joachim Jungius

Joachim Jungius (22 October 1587 – 23 September 1657) was a German mathematician, logician and philosopher of sciences.
Life.
He was a native of Lübeck. He studied metaphysics at the Universities of Rostock and Giessen, where he earned in 1608 his degree. 
Beginning in 1609, he was a professor of mathematics at the University of Giessen, and in 1614–15, with Wolfgang Ratke (1571–1635) and Christoph Helvig (1581–1617), he took part in studies of educational reform. In 1616, he returned to Rostock in order to study medicine, later obtaining his medical doctorate from the University of Padua (1619). From 1619 to 1623, he practiced medicine in Lübeck. In 1622 at Rostock, he founded an early scientific society known as "Societas Ereunetica sive Zetetica" 
From 1624 to 1628, Jungius worked as a professor of mathematics at Rostock, his service here being briefly interrupted in 1625, when he spent time as professor of medicine at the University of Helmstedt. From 1629 until 1657, he was professor of natural sciences at the "Akademisches Gymnasium", a secondary school in Hamburg. Jungius believed that science was based on mathematics, and at Hamburg stressed the importance of critical thinking to his students. He also felt that mathematics and logic served as a remedy to metaphysical and mystical speculation.
Works.
Jungius was an important figure of 17th century atomism, and was an advocate of a "corpuscular chemistry" that assumed the conservation of mass. He also demonstrated that a catenary was not a parabola.
In 1638 he published the textbook "Logica Hamburgensis", which presented late medieval theories and techniques of logic. Here he demonstrated oblique cases of arguments that did not adhere to simpler forms of inference; An example being: "The square of an even number is even; 6 is even; therefore, the square of 6 is even". His double position as connected to scholastic logic, but also to innovations, earns him the classification Semi-Ramist.

Albert III, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst

Albert III, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst (died ca. 1 August 1359) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst.
He was the eldest son of Albert II, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his second wife Beatrix, daughter of Rudolf I, Elector of Saxony and Duke of Saxe-Wittemberg.
Life.
During the life of his father, Albert was made co-ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst; at the same time, his uncle Waldemar I was also co-ruler with his residence at Dessau.
His reign apparently lasted only a few months, and he predeceased his father and uncle. His next brother Rudolf was ordained a priest, thus his father's heir and eventual successor was his youngest brother John II.

Media of Egypt

The media of Egypt is highly influential in Egypt and in the Arab World, attributed to its large audience and increasing freedom from governmental control. Freedom of the media is guaranteed in the constitution, and the government is increasingly respecting this, however many laws still remain that restrict this right. After the Egyptian presidential election of 2005, Ahmed Selim, office director for Information Minister Anas al-Fiqi, declared the era of a "free, transparent and independent Egyptian media".
History of the printing press.
The printing press was first introduced to Egypt by Napoleon Bonaparte during his French Campaign in Egypt and Syria.
The press.
The written press is very diverse in Egypt, with over 600 newspapers, journals, and magazines. However these are owned mostly or in some way by the government, the opposition or other political parties. Several journalists from private newspapers have been arrested and jailed for breaching laws that prohibit criticism of the President, state institutions and foreign leaders, or "putting out false news harming the reputation and interests of the country". However, unlike many of Egypt's regional counterparts, criticism of the government in general does take place, after amendments to existing press laws in 2006 which however still criminalise libel.
In 2009 an Egyptian court revoked the publishing license for "Ibdaa" ("creativity"), a small-circulation literary magazine, for publishing a "blasphemous" poem by Hilmi Salem called “On the balcony of Leila Murad" in which God is likened to an Egyptian peasant who farms and milks cows. It came to the attention of authorities at Al-Azhar University, described as “the government’s highest authority on religion”, who then petitioned the courts, who ruled that "Freedom of the press...should be used responsibly and not touch on the basic foundations of Egyptian society, and family, religion and morals". Over the past two decades, Al-Azhar University censored more than 196 texts.
Television.
There are two state broadcasters and an increasing number of private broadcasters. Figures from the CIA World Factbook state more than 98 television channels in 1995, and 57 AM and 14 FM radio channels in 1999. Pan-Arab channels such as Al-Jazeera are also very popular among viewers, especially for news, as private broadcasters are forbidden to broadcast their own news, instead only focusing on entertainment or music. The Ministry of Information controls content in the state-owned broadcast media. Egypt was the first Arab nation to have its own satellite, Nilesat 101 which allows the Egyptian TV and film industry to supply much of the Arab-speaking world with shows from its Media Production City. The previously tight controls on state TV and radio gave way to even and fair coverage of all political parties involved in the Egyptian presidential election of 2005, a first for Egyptian media. However in 2006 several journalists working for the Cairo branch of the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera were detained for investigating subjects such as police brutality and "harming the country's reputation".
Radio.
Egyptian radio broadcasting (as in both FM and AM bands) began to serve in Egypt in the 1920s as locally owned radios. They began airing radio as The Egyptian State Radio on the 31 May 1934 in agreement with the Marconi Company. In 1947 the contract with the Marconi Company was canceled and was radio broadcasting was nationalized by the Egyptian government.
By the early 1990s, Egypt had only four FM stations, but the number increased to six by the end of the decade. In 2000 stations moving from the AM band and the introduction of private stations raised the number to ten stations as of 2006.
Internet.
The government has actively encouraged internet usage, quadrupling over the last few years with around 17 million regular users in 2010, around 21 percent of the population. The internet is often used for political opposition, blogging, and lively debate amongst the public and by the media which can publish stories that are prohibited in the print media. The Egyptian government does not widely censor the internet, though the state-run Supreme Administrative Court allowed the Ministry of Information and Ministry of Communication to close down or block websites that are a "threat to national security". However, several people have been detained for insulting Islam, state institutions and President Hosni Mubarak during pro-democracy protests, as well as government officials in cases of abuse by the security services. On 10 April 2011, Egyptian blogger Maikel Nabil was sentenced to three years in prison by a military court on charges of insulting the armed forces and publishing false information after he published an article on 28 March titled "The people and the army were never one hand" in which he detailed cases of abuse by the military and criticized the Supreme Council of Armed Forces for undermining the revolution.
Freedoms.
Following the peace talks over the Middle East conflict at the Sharm al-Sheikh in Egypt, "Al-Ahram" was caught doctoring a photo that had showed U.S. president Barack Obama in the front to show Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak walking in the lead on a red carpet ahead of Binyamin Netanyahu, Mahmoud Abbas, and Jordan's King Abdullah II. Egyptian bloggers said the photo was "unprofessional" and said it an example of deception towards the people of Egypt; others said the photo was an attempt to distract attention from Egypt's waning role in the. However, Osama Saraya, the editor-in chief, defended the decision saying "The expressionist photo is...a brief, live and true expression of the prominent stance of President Mubarak in the Palestinian issue, his unique role in leading it before Washington or any other."

Batch Enhancer

BATCH ENHANCER (or BE) (or BE.EXE,) is an applet or free-standing utility packaged with Norton Utilities (NU) to graphically enhance the presentation of batch files (Batch files are like a script, a series of commands executed at once, automatically by the computer itself). Batch Enhancer allows the use of colours, square graphics, delays, beeps, a little more complex decision parameters than the usual batch file programming, easier to create user-choice menus, and other functions. 
BE is unusual in Norton's suite of utilities in that it was not designed to primarily be launched by NU itself, but be used like another (DOS) command/function to simplify the writing of executable BATCH files, or make them more powerful, such as for creating colorful and animated DOS screens that were typically just plain blue & cyan.
For examples, usage syntaxes and examples from BE itself: 
So if the line: "BE DELAY 18" was run from inside a BATCH (.BAT) file, it would pause for one second before moving to the next instruction. At modern (2013) computer speeds, many batch files run so fast they are invisible, this delay would allow the user to see the DOS window and that it ran. BE.EXE from Norton Utilities 4.50 is 22,426 bytes in size, dated 10-16-88.

Honda Civic (sixth generation)

The sixth-generation Honda Civic was introduced in 1995. It retained its class-leading handling as it, along with the fourth and fifth generations, had front double wishbone suspension, the advanced independent suspension inspired by Honda's racing research. However, the sixth iteration of Civic did not have the high power-to-weight ratio as its two predecessors had. Two wagons were also made on the platform; the JDM Orthia, based on the Civic sedan, and a Domani-based model, sold as Civic Aerodeck, in Europe. Neither were offered in North America. A Domani based five-door liftback was also offered for sale in Europe alongside the regular Civic model from 1995 to 2001.
At its introduction in 1993, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award for the third time.
Trims and equipment (US).
Coupe: Trims available in the coupe body style were the EJ6 (US DX, Canadian DX and DX-V), EJ7 (US HX), EJ8 (US EX, Canadian Si) and EM1 (only 1999 and 2000; US Si, Canadian SiR).
Hatchback: Trims available in the hatchback body style were the EJ6 (US CX and DX, Canadian CX/CX-G/DX/SE), EJ9 (1.4L SOHC model), EK1 (1.5L SOHC VTEC-E model), EK2 (1.3L model), EK3 (1.5L SOHC VTEC-E model), EK4 (Japanese SiR, European SiR and/or VTi), EK6 (Japanese 1.6L SOHC model), EK7 (Japanese 1.6L SOHC model) and the EK9 (Japanese Type R).
Sedan: Trims available in the sedan body style were the EJ6 (US DX/LX/VP, Canadian EX/LX), EJ8 (US EX), EJ9 (1.4L SOHC model), EK1 (1.5L SOHC VTEC-E model), EK2 (1.3L model), EK3 (1.5L SOHC model), EK4 (Japanese SiR, European SiR and/or VTi), EK5 (Japanese 1.6L SOHC 4WD model), EK8 (Japanese 1.6L SOHC model) and EN1 (US GX).
CX: The base trim, available as a hatchback only. Appointed very sparingly (no standard radio or power steering), it came equipped with 13-inch wheels, 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, dual airbags, tinted windows, split/folding rear seat, and seating for five people. In 1997, the CX added 14-inch wheels as standard equipment. In 2000, the CX added tilt steering as standard equipment.
DX: Available as a hatchback, coupé, or sedan. It included all standard equipment from CX plus tilt steering and am/fm radio. Power steering was standard on all sedans, and on the coupes when ordered with automatic transmission. For 1997, the DX added 14-inch wheels as standard equipment.
LX: Available as a four-door only. It included all standard equipment from DX plus 14-inch wheels, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, power steering, front stabilizer bar, front center armrest with storage compartment, cargo area light, cruise control, and tachometer. For 1997, the LX added air conditioning as standard equipment.
EX: Available as a coupé or sedan. It included all standard equipment from LX plus a higher-horsepower SOHC VTEC engine, power sunroof, air conditioning, remote entry system, plus body-colored side mirrors and side molding. ABS was standard on sedan only. For 1999, the EX added a cd player as standard equipment.
HX: Available as coupé only, this trim was specially tooled for higher fuel efficiency. It was the only model available with a CVT (continuously variable transmission), though customers could also choose a 5-speed manual transmission. It included all standard equipment from DX, plus a slightly higher horsepower VTEC-E engine, alloy wheels, power windows, power locks, power steering, and tachometer.
GX: Introduced in 1997 and available as a sedan for fleet-purchase only, this trim was specially designed to run on natural gas. See Honda Civic GX for detail and references.
VP: Introduced in 1998 and available as a sedan only, this trim was designed as a “Value Package” above the DX. It included all standard equipment from DX plus automatic transmission, power locks, cd player, air conditioning, keyless entry, and special paint.
Most models had a standard AM/FM radio in the center dashboard with a backlit LCD display (except CX had no radio) but a slave cassette player or CD player was available through dealer-installed options and was installed in the forward portion of the console and was hidden from view when the cupholder was open. EX models had the slave cassette player standard. Dealers also offered AM/FM cassette and AM/FM CD decks to replace the stock radio. All vehicles were equipped with four speakers (except for the EX which included two extra tweeters located on the front doors), radio wiring (prep), and an antenna regardless of whether or not they had a radio.
Si.
After a brief hiatus, the Civic Si reappeared in 1998, available as a coupé only. With the adoption of the VTi badge in Europe and the SiR and Type R badges in Japan for the sports variants of Civics, the Si became primarily a US-specific badge, a branding trend that would continue in subsequent Civic generations. Going from 0-60 in 7.1 seconds, the 1999 Civic Si trim featured a 1.6-litre B16A2 engine that made at 8,000 rpm and 111 ft-lbs of torque at 7,000 rpm. While similar to the powerplant in the Del Sol VTEC, the Civic Si saw some notable differences, which include a larger throttle body, improved intake manifold, strengthened connecting rods, low-friction/high-silicon pistons, a fully counterweighted crankshaft, and an exhaust system with larger piping diameter. Due to its good fuel economy (27/31 city/hwy MPG), independent suspension at all four corners, and a more popular coupe form, the trim garnered a dedicated following in spite of its short production cycle.
Changes from the standard Civic included stiffer, progressive-rate springs, stiffer front and rear anti-roll bars, and a tower brace, which contributed to a flatter-cornering ride. It was available with a five-speed manual transmission only, standard equipment also including disc brakes all around. Aesthetic exterior changes from the LX/EX models were minimal, with the Si trim featuring a lower-profile and wider 15-inch wheel/tire package, a subtle chin-spoiler, painted side sills, and Si badging. There are power locks, power windows, a cd-player, cruise control, air conditioning, power sunroof, and tilt steering. For the interior, the sixth generation Si also had tilt adjustment for the bottom cushion, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote keyless entry, and red-faced instrumentation with Si branding.
Paint colors.
Colors available in the US were as follows:
1996: Cyclone Blue Metallic (sedan), Cypress Green Pearl (coupe and sedan), Midori Green Pearl (hatch), Granada Black Pearl, Frost White (coupe and sedan), New Vogue Silver Metallic, Milano Red (coupe), Island Coral Pearl (coupe and sedan) and Roma Red (hatch).
1997: Cyclone Blue Metallic (sedan), Cypress Green Pearl (coupe and sedan), Granada Black Pearl, Frost White (coupe and sedan), New Vogue Silver Metallic, Dark Amethyst Pearl (hatch), Milano Red (coupe), Island Coral Pearl (coupe), Inza Red Pearl (coupe and sedan) and Roma Red (hatch).
1998: Cyclone Blue Metallic (sedan), Cypress Green Pearl (coupe and sedan), Taffeta White (coupe and sedan), New Vogue Silver Metallic, Flamenco Black Pearl, Dark Amethyst Pearl (hatch), Milano Red (coupe) and Roma Red (hatch).
1999: Electron Blue Pearl (Si coupe), Iced Teal Pearl (sedan), Clover Green Pearl (coupe and sedan), Taffeta White (coupe and sedan), New Vogue Silver Metallic, Flamenco Black Pearl, Dark Amethyst Pearl (hatch), Milano Red (coupe) and Roma Red (hatch).
2000: Electron Blue Pearl (Si coupe), Iced Teal Pearl (sedan), Clover Green Pearl (coupe and sedan), Taffeta White (coupe and sedan), New Vogue Silver Metallic, Flamenco Black Pearl, Milano Red (coupe), Roma Red (hatch), Vintage Plum Pearl (sedan) and Titanium Metallic (sedan).
Facelift.
In 1998 for the 1999 model year, the Civic had some updates for both the interior and exterior. These redesigns could vary according to the country of origin for the car. For example, in some European countries there was no redesign to the climate control area or to the rear of the sedan models.
The updated cars received a face lift which included a new grille, new headlights, and a new front bumper, fenders and hood and redesigned taillights. The coupe and sedans models also received a slight redesign to the bottom of the rear bumper. On the pre-facelift sedans, the stop lights were on top of the reverse and turn lights; for the facelift version, the reverse and turn lights were on top of the stop lights. For the coupe and hatchback the layouts remained as before; however, the rear turn signal lenses became clear/white instead of amber to match the reverse lights (the turn light bulbs themselves now were amber).
Inside, the center console had a makeover. The sliding air system controls were replaced by rotary ones, which freed up space to accommodate an enlarged radio, which included the cassette player or CD player. Previously, the large size of the ventilation controls reduced the size of the radio, necessitating a slave cassette player or CD player at the bottom of the console.
Engines.
In Japan, the cheapest model was the EL (and also a short-lived special EL-II model), powered by a 1,343 cc D13B engine with at 6,300 rpm. As for most of the sixth generation Civics, it has a single overhead camshaft and four valves per cylinder.
All US model CX, DX, Value Package, and LX models used the "D16Y7" I4. It produced at 6,200 rpm, of torque at 4,600 rpm, with a compression ratio of 9.6:1. Fuel injection was multi-point, with SOHC (single overhead camshaft) and four valves per cylinder.
The US model HX had the "D16Y5". It produced at 6,300 rpm, of torque at 5,400 rpm, with a compression ratio of 9.4:1. Fuel injection was multi-point, with SOHC, four valves per cylinder, and VTEC-E (electronically controlled variable valve timing, tuned for economy).
The US model EX and Canadian Si had the "D16Y8". It produced at 6600 rpm, of torque at 5500 rpm, with a compression ratio of 9.6:1. Fuel injection was multi-point, with SOHC, 4 valves per cylinder, and VTEC (electronically controlled variable valve timing, tuned for power).
The US model Si and Canadian SiR used the "B16A2". It produced at 7600 rpm, of torque at 7000 rpm, with a compression ratio of 10.2:1. Fuel injection was multi-point, with DOHC (dual overhead camshafts), 4 valves per cylinder, and VTEC.
In the UK, Europe, South Africa and the Philippines, there were a number of sedans and aerodecks between 1996 and 2000 produced with the B16A1, B16A2, B18B and even B18C motors.
The GX sedan was a trim available only in the United States. These cars were produced in fairly limited numbers and were sold to government agencies. The D16B5 which powered the GX was a compressed natural gas engine.
In Japan, the Civic Ferio Si used the second generation B16A engine while the other models used D15B, D16A or D13B engines.
In the Middle East market, the Civic came with a D15Z4 engine for LXi and EXi models.
in Australia, most models came with the D16Y4 engine; the VTI sedan model had the "D16Y5", the VTI coupe the "D16Y8" and the VTI-R Hatchback and Coupe had the B16A engine.
Transmissions.
Most models (DX, LX, EX, Si) were available with a standard 5-speed manual transmission with a hydraulic clutch, or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission. Various gear sets and final drives were used between models, resulting here are 4 different manual transmission combinations:
CX/HX/DX/LX hatchback: Tall gearing and tallest final drive
DX/LX coupe/sedan: Same tall gearing as CX/HX/DX/LX hatchback with a shorter final drive than CS/HX/DX/LX hatchback
EX hatchback: Short gearing, same final drive as the DX/LX coupes and sedans
EX coupe/sedan: same gearing as EX hatchback, with shorter final drive
The HX model was offered with the 5-speed manual or a "CVT" Continuously Variable Transmission which offered three driving ranges, D (standard transmission ratios for normal driving), S (secondary ratios for spirited driving with higher engine speeds), and L (lowest ratios to provide maximum engine braking and peak power). The conventional 4-speed automatic was not available on the HX model.
A JDM variant called the civic RTi was also produced and it featured either manual and automatic transmissions coupled to a Honda real-time all-wheel-drive layout.
Weights.
All weights listed in this table are in lbs.
Worldwide.
The JDM Civic Sedan (known as the Civic Ferio Si) featured a DOHC VTEC B16A engine, rear headrests, an Integra Type-R style shift knob, unique seating fabric and the same 15" alloy wheels that also appeared on the 1999-2000 US market Civic Si Coupé. Other JDM Ferio models included a model with the RealTime 4wheel drive and a rear wiper in the back window of the sedan, which was not seen in other markets.
Canada.
Canadian models were mostly similar to US models, though with different designations. Canadian Civic sedans came in LX and EX, which roughly correspond to the American DX and LX; there was no Honda-branded Canadian equivalent to the American EX sedan - the Canadian-market only Acura EL filled this spot. Canadian Civic coupes came in DX, Si, and SiR, the equivalent of the DX, EX, and Si in the United States. Only the EX sedan, Si coupe and SiR coupe had power locks and power windows, the Si and SiR coupes were the only Canadian Civic models with a power moonroof. All sedans and coupes had a group option package available that added air conditioning and anti-lock brakes. The hatchbacks, available only in CX and DX trims, were sold as economy cars; as in the US, they had none of the amenities of other models in the Civic lineup, not even as options. All sedans, coupes, and the hatchback DX had two front airbags; while the CX hatchback had the driver's side airbag only.
Canadian SiR and Si models included ABS brakes and heated mirrors which were not included on US Si models. The Canadian SiR also was available in New Vogue Silver Metallic, which was not available for the USA's comparable Si model.
The Civic DX Special Edition (SE) hatchback was a special trim released for the year 2000 only. The car was similar to the Canadian DX hatchback, but came with additional standard parts including mesh 14-inch wheels (similar in design to the more common third generation Integra mesh wheels), body-coloured side mirrors and side mouldings, a mid-wing and a Special badge on the rear of the hatch.
Australia.
The Civic was introduced in 1996 initially with two 1.6-litre engines. The non-VTEC motor was known as the GLi, while the VTEC was standard across the range, with an optional 4-speed automatic in the GLi or CVT in the VTi. The high output B16A2 engine was introduced later and available in the coupe and hatch, known as the VTi-R.
Asian SiRII.
From 1996 to 2000, Honda produced Civic SiRII which came with a B16A engine, but it was only available in Asian market. This engine produced ( at 7800 rpm with a displacement of 1595 cc.
Philippines.
The sixth generation Civic was initially launched in 1996 with two trims: the LXi with a non-VTEC 1.5L SOHC D15Z4 engine, and the VTi with a 1.6L SOHC D16Y5 VTEC-E engine. Both came with regular front disk brakes and rear drum brakes. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, available in both trims. During the 1999 facelift, an SiR version was introduced. It had a B16a2 1.6L DOHC VTEC engine and was initially available in nighthawk black, tafetta white and passion orange variants. Milano red and sunburst yellow color variants followed aftwerwards with silver accents on the center console. Other notable differences were a mesh grill (similar with the EK9), three-spoked red stitched steering wheel, 15 inch Enkei rims (similar to the USDM Si & JDM Vi-RS), leather stitched shiftknob (similar with the JDM SiR), front upper strut bar, Kenwood CD player, bigger front and rear disc brakes, unique interior fabric colors and an optional front chin and spoiler. The only transmission choice was a 5-speed manual. The SiR is very common with car & race enthusiasts as it offered the highest power output of any locally released 1.6L car to date which is why it is still very marketable as a used car.
Japanese Type-R.
There was also a Japanese domestic market only Civic Type-R, that was only available as a hatchback and 5-speed manual with LSD. This model was equipped with a powerful B16B ( at 8,200 rpm) (AKA PCT), which is essentially a destroked version of the Integra Type-R B18C engine. The chassis was given the designation EK9. The EK9 was very special as it was essentially based on the JDM EK4 SiR but taken out of the production line and given additional reinforcement to the chassis and body shell. Weight was also meticulously removed to create a light weight racecar feel. Other additions over the EK4 were bigger brakes, quicker steering ratio, specially tuned suspension, Recaro seats, Momo steering wheel, titanium shift knob, front lip spoiler, rear wing, smoked headlights and a hand built engine that embodied the racing spirit of Honda. This engine featured a hand ported cylinder head, lighter flywheel, redesigned cam profiles, high compression pistons and balanced crankshaft. The gearbox was fitted with a helical type limited slip differential.
South Africa 180i Civic.
In South Africa, the fifth and sixth generation Civics (Honda Ballade as it was known) were available with the Acura Integra B18B3 and B18B4 engine, respectively.
Europe - MA MB MC five-door Civic / Civic Aerodeck.
Based on the Domani, this version was marketed in Europe as the MA/MB/MC Civic and Civic Aerodeck. It was built in five-door and Aerodeck (Estate) models in various trim levels and engine sizes. The Aerodeck name was previously used on the Honda Accord Aerodeck, which was a two-door station wagon, popularly known in Europe as a shooting-brake. 1.4 L (D14A2/A5/A7), 1.5 L (D15Z8/Z3), 1.6 L (D16Y2/Y3, D16W2/W3, D16B2 etc.) and 1.8 litre (B18C4) petrol engines were available. These came with five-door body and fifty-five litre fuel tank, ABS, driver and passenger air bags, power steering and electric door mirrors, amongst other things. The later models came with air conditioning as standard. The 1.8 VTi model was the flagship model (explained in detail below) with the biggest petrol engine to be given to MA MB MC Civics. The Domani-based Civics were also available with the Rover L-Series diesel engine which was a 2-litre, eight-valve, direct-injection turbocharged unit (20T2N, 20T2R); an essential addition in the European market. Later diesel engines came with intercoolers. The chassis codes designated to this model and generation of Civics were chassis codes MA8, MA9, MB1, MB2, MB3, MB4, MB6, MB7, and MB8 for the liftback, while the Aerodeck chassis codes are MB9, MC1, MC2, MC3, and MC9. Compared to the original Domani, the Liftback and Aerodeck featured a new interior, similar to that of the more upmarket Rover 400. Honda had a long-serving partnership with the Rover group, who at the time didn't have enough funds for the tooling to produce an all new car, which allowed Rover to produce its own C-Segment competitor based around the design of the Domani shell and using a lot of its underpinnings to produce the Rover 400/45 and later MG ZS. Rover made mostly cosmetic changes (which included front fenders/wings, bonnet, headlights, bumpers, rear lights and tailgate were different on the Rover as well as more upmarket cabin materials and greater use of wood and decals) to have a brand new design in the showrooms, which was very cost effective but divided opinion amongst brand enthusiasts.
1.8 /1.6 VTi.
As with all Honda models of the age, VTi denoted the inclusion of Honda's VTEC technology. There was a rear VTi badge, and decals of "DOHC VTEC" on the rear doors, as well as front/rear bumper lips and side skirts (in VTI-S models). 1996 saw the introduction of the VTi model and then a limited edition VTI-S. The VTI came in two different flavours - the DOHC 1.6 VTi hatch and sedan (B16A2 engine) and the DOHC 1.8 VTi five-door (with the larger B18C4). The 1.6 VTi car was actually slightly faster in acceleration than the 1.8 due to the different gear ratios. The 1.6 was also a lighter engine in a lighter car, helping to reduce the 0-60 mph acceleration time by about 0.3 seconds. Front/rear disc brakes were standard on all VTi/VTi-S versions. The five-door versions (VTi/VTi-S) included a Torsen limited slip differential which meant they were quicker out of corners than the 1.6 (three-door) due to being able to accelerate out of corners more effectively.
The 1.8 VTi Civic came with a host of standard equipment, some of which was not available on the three-door (1.6) equivalents. Standard 1.8 spec includes:
Exterior: 
Front lip/spoiler, Rear boot spoiler with integral brake light, Headlight washers, electric sunroof, colour-coded mirrors, colour-coded door handles, colour-coded front rear bumpers, front fog lights, lightweight Speedline 5 spoke alloy wheels.
Interior: Unique half leather sports style seats (full leather optional), front/rear electric windows, Electrically operated/heated door mirrors, air conditioning, dashboard instrument light dimmer, front and rear head rests. Leather steering wheel with red stitching.
United Kingdom Limited Editions.
The MB6 VTi-S five-door was made in a limited run of 500 of each body type, and only sold in the Honda colour 'Pirates Black', with body coloured bumpers. The VTI-S improved on the appearance of the standard Civic VTi five-door with a more pronounced front lip and also a rear lip on the bumpers, and different side skirts. The VTi-S specification also included chrome/aluminium gear-knob(silver/black plastic on later VTiS models), VTI-S floor-mats and tailgate badging. It also came fitted with lightweight 15" Speedline Chrono alloy wheels, with a split spoke design. The later VTi-S models came fitted with the lightweight Speedline "fan" alloy wheels. Other than this, the it is identical to the regular VTi. The instrument dials on later VTi-S models changed slightly, now with italic numbering.
The three-door EK4 VTi-S was produced in 1998 only and 200 were produced in this time, all on 'R' registration plates. Like the MB6 VTi-S, the EK4 VTi-S was based on the standard VTi hatch, with differences being the Starlight Black paint, front and rear bumper lips/skirts, rear mid-spoiler, 15" speedline chrono alloy wheels, the dashboard cluster used white numbering on the speedometer, fuel gauge etc., rather than orange/red as in the regular VTi, however it still retained the red needles. The boot badges spelling out 'Honda' 'Civic' '1.6VTi' and 'VTEC' were all replaced with a single VTi-S badge, and there was an alloy gear knob and VTi-S floor mats. Mechanically and in performance terms it is identical to a regular EK4 VTi. Due to a problem with the registration process many genuine VTi-S' were not on the log books as a VTi-S, but a VTi, and regular VTi Civic's were logged as VTi-S, this problem also affected the special edition EK4 Civic Jordan, of which some were also logged as a VTi-S.
To commemorate the Honda (Mugen) Jordan F1 team. A 500 car special limited edition Honda Civic VTi (EK4 3-door model) was created with their own signed Eddie Jordan Plaque with the specific number stamped on it in the centre console. This car was sold in 1999–2000. It had the same basic spec as the EK4 VTi, but the extras included: Sunlight Yellow paint work, yellow-and-black leather interior, Jordan decals on the sides and rear of the car as well as stitched into the seats and floor carpets.
Rover 200, 400, 25, 45 and MG ZR, ZS.
Rover developed these vehicles from the Honda Domani (sold as a Civic in Europe) using their own engines. UK produced with styling and interior specifications were aimed primarily at the UK market.

Bocchetta Pass

Bocchetta Pass or Bochetta Pass or Passo della Bocchetta is a mountain pass in the Ligurian Apennine Mountains in Liguria north of Genoa, Italy. The summit of the pass is at an elevation of 772 meters (2,532 feet).
Geography.
It is crossed by a highway that connects Genoa and Alessandria. An old Roman road ran through Bocchetta Pass from Genua (modern Genoa) to Dertona (modern Tortona).
The Bocchetta Pass is located about north of Genoa. From the south, the SP5 (Provincial) highway follows the Polcevera valley north from the town of Campomorone. From the north, the SP160 highway approaches the pass along the Lemme valley via the towns of Gavi and Voltaggio. Currently, most traffic uses the Autostrada A7 which runs through the mountains to the east.
History.
The Roman consul Spurius Postumius Albinus Magnus had the Via Postumia built in 148 BC. The Roman road connected Genoa with Tortona, Piacenza, and Cremona. At Calvatone the road forked and the northern branch went to Verona while the southern branch went to Mantua. During the French Revolutionary Wars the Bocchetta Pass was located in territory belonging to the Republic of Genoa. Its north side was guarded by the fortress of Gavi.

John II, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst

John II, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst (died 11 April 1382) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst.
He was the youngest son of Albert II, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his second wife Beatrix, daughter of Rudolf I, Elector of Saxony and Duke of Saxe-Wittemberg.
Life.
The death of his older brother Albert III in 1359 made John his father's sole heir; his older brother Rudolf was an ordained priest. In 1362 John inherited the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst, but first had to rule jointly with his uncle Waldemar I until his death in 1368, then with his cousin Waldemar II, who died without issue four years later (in 1371). Following his cousin's death, John became the sole ruler of Anhalt-Zerbst.
Marriage and issue.
In 1366 John married Elisabeth (d. Dessau, aft. 20 January 1420), daughter of John I, Count of Henneberg-Schleusingen. They had four children:

Francis Charles Lawley

Francis Charles Lawley (24 May 1825 – 18 September 1901) was a British journalist and Liberal Party politician.
He was the youngest son of Paul Thompson, 1st Baron Wenlock, and after schooling in Hatfield attended Rugby School in May 1837. In 1848 he graduated from Balliol College, Oxford with a second-class honours degree in Literae Humaniores. He entered Inner Temple as a student in 1847, but failed to be called to the bar, instead gaining a BCL. In 1852 he was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Beverley, and also became private secretary to William Ewart Gladstone during his time as the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the same year.
In June 1854 he was considered for the position of Governor of South Australia, but was swiftly discounted after a political scandal forced him to resign from office. He was known for his passion for horse-racing and gambling, and this had financially damaged him. It was revealed in August 1854 that to recoup his lost funds he had been using insider information gained from his position within the Exchequer to speculate on Funds. After this came out he was forced to resign from his position as a Member of Parliament, and also as Gladstone's secretary. Ironically despite the information involved he failed to gain any amount of money; Lord Henry Lennox remarked that "Lawley's greatest sin was to lose on the funds, knowing what he did".
With his career in ruins he moved to the United States in 1856, becoming a correspondent for "The Times" covering the American Civil War with the Confederate Army, and authored several books including "The Bench and the Jockey Club" and "The Life and Times of the Druid", as well as contributing to magazines such as St Paul's Magazine. In 1865 he returned to London and wrote for "The Daily Telegraph". He continued to have financial problems, beginning bankruptcy proceedings in 1874 and 1881, and proceedings against his estate continued after his death.

Tiger Lily (UK band)

Tiger Lily was a short-lived glam rock band and the seed of Ultravox! (later changed to Ultravox). It was founded in London in 1973 by Royal College of Art student Dennis Leigh (vocals), who left his northern industrial environment in Lancashire, Chris St. John (bass) (born Christopher Allen), another college student who previously played with Stoned Rose, and Stevie Shears (guitar), a Dagenham based musician. In 1974 British-Canadian drummer Warren Cann (drums), who recently was rejected as a band member by Sparks, and later William Currie (violin, keyboards), named Billy Curry, who was in a theatre band.
In 1974, still as a four-piece band, without Curry, Tiger Lily made their first gig in Chorley, Lancashire, hometown of Leigh. The band wore clothes like New York Dolls, who influenced them. However, their true first show was in the Marquee Club, London, supporting Heavy Metal Kids. Later, Billy Currie joined originally as violinist.
The band had a glam style influenced by Rolling Stones, Beatles late era, and the current glam artists (like David Bowie, Roxy Music, New York Dolls and Steve Harley). Gull Records released on 14 March 1975 their only 7" single named "Ain't Misbehavin'", which was a cover of the Fats Waller song, while the B-side was "Monkey Jive". After a number of live concerts, the band changed names many times: The Damned, The Zips, Fire Of London, etc. until 1976, when they decided on Ultravox!. During the pre-Ultravox! era (including Tiger Lily years), they composed many songs later to appear on their first album in 1977, "Ultravox!". By that time Leigh adopted the stage name John Foxx, and Chris St. John became Chris Cross.
Their version of "Ain't Misbehavin'" was released on CD in 2000, in a compilation album of glam rock and pre-punk bands called "Glitterbest - 20 Pre Punk 'n' Glam Terrace Stompers". The 1975 single, "Monkey Jive", was never released on CD.

Shannon Cole

Shannon Cole (born 4 August 1984 in Sydney) is an Australian footballer who plays as a right midfielder for Western Sydney Wanderers FC.
Early life.
Cole attended St Ambrose primary school, Concord West, and St Patrick's College, Strathfield. In 2003, He studied drama at the University of Western Sydney for 1.5 years before putting degree on hold to pursue a football career.
Club career.
Cole's early football career saw a series of stints with NSW state league clubs, in particular APIA Leichhardt, Dulwich Hill, Rockdale City Suns and Parramatta Eagles. He also left Australia for spells in US college football in the tiny Michigan town of Northville and semi-professional football with Waitakere United in New Zealand. Following this, Cole spent a month trialling with ambitious English Championship side Doncaster Rovers, before spending a stint with Israeli side Maccabi Netanya.
In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald in July 2008, Cole reflected on these early globetrotting stages of his career: "With the college football, I had a friend over there already, so I went over for the year when I was 19 and it was just something I wanted to try, living away from home and live as a footballer. I kind of saw it as a personal challenge. Going to Europe was also great, but I don't have an EU passport at the moment and it made it difficult to get a deal. Being full-time with Doncaster, even for a month, was a great experience. The standard in Israel was also really high and there were a lot of really good, strong African boys there, but Netanya were looking for a senior player to come in and run the midfield, and I was just 22, so it didn't work out."
Cole signed with NSW Premier League club Sydney Olympic in 2007. During his time there, Cole was a member of the Sydney Olympic team that lifted the 2008 NSW Premier League Johnny Warren Cup, after a 2–1 extra time win in the final against the Sutherland Sharks. Cole provided the assist from a free kick for Olympic's first goal in this game, scored by Emmanuel Giannaros in the 52nd minute.
Sydney FC.
On 15 August 2008 he was signed by Sydney FC on a two year contract from Sydney Olympic. Chosen mainly because of his ability to play at left and right back or midfield. 
On 23 August 2008, Cole scored a free kick against Central Coast Mariners that curled over the wall into the bottom corner to put Sydney in the lead 3–2. This proved to be the winning goal. Another goal the next week against Perth Glory cemented his position in the team.
In December he scored his third goal for Sydney in their 3–2 loss to Melbourne Victory. His goal was the first of the match, just less than 30 seconds into the game.
In 2010–11 A-League, Cole scored a spectacular free-kick goal against Melbourne Victory at Sydney Football Stadium in Round 1 of Grand Final Replay on 7 August 2010. He scored again in Round 8 Mid-Week Fixture with a spectacular goal outside from penalty box against North Queensland Fury. Cole scored again, this time he ran past the defenders of Perth Glory to slide the ball past Tando Velaphi in Round 15 then later did a spectacular acrobatic jump.
Western Sydney Wanderers FC.
On 30 June 2012, it was officially announced he had joined the newly formed Western Sydney Wanderers club.
International career.
On 1 October 2008 was called up from Socceroos coach Pim Verbeek for the Australia national football team for a training camp, he was not promoted for the 22 squad against Qatar. His second call was on 19 January 2009 against Indonesia and played 73 minutes in his debut.

8 cm Luftminenwerfer M 15

The 8 cm Luftminenwerfer M 15 (Pneumatic trench mortar) was a light mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was designed by the 58th Infantry Division and the first twenty were built in the division's workshops. Later production was contracted out to Vereinigte Elektrische Maschinen A. G. in Budapest. It used the breakable screw method to retain the bomb in place until the air pressure in the chamber was strong enough to break the screw. Grooves of different depths could be used to vary the range. It was sometimes referred to as the Roka-Halasz system.

Foreign Legion (album)

"Foreign Legion" was the third studio album by Murfreesboro, TN band Fluid Ounces.
The album marked a turning point for Fluid Ounces. The band had separated from Spongebath Records, and both founding members Brian Rogers and Ben Morton had left in 1999 to pursue other interests. (The album was in fact named in honor of Morton, who at the time was considering joining the elite French Foreign Legion.) However, while Rogers and Morton both contributed guitar and bass to several tracks respectively, the album also featured Doug Payne on guitar, Jason Dietz on bass, and Justin Meyer on drums.
The album was recorded at County Q Studios in Nashville, Tennessee and was engineered by Chuck Pfaff.
Although "Foreign Legion" finally received a proper release by Japanese label Cutting Edge in March 2002, the album sadly shared a similar fate as "Big Notebook for Easy Piano" and "In the New Old-Fashioned Way", receiving only minimal distribution and promotion domestically.
While the album has received some criticism for its slicker, polished sound, "Foreign Legion" continued to widen the band's fanbase and featured the trademark Fluid Ounces variety of eclectic musical styles, ranging from playful boogie-woogie ("Poet Tree") and lush balladry ("The Last Thing") to hints of Latin ("Encyclopedia Brown") and psychedelia ("Stark Raving Mad").

Life.
After the death of his father in 1316, the young Waldemar and his older brother Albert II were put under the custody of their maternal uncle Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal. When both brothers reached adulthood, they ruled the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst jointly. Waldemar made his residence in Dessau and Albert in Zerbst or Köthen.
In 1359 Waldemar's nephew Albert III was also made co-ruler by his father Albert II, but he soon died. Three years later (in 1362), Albert II died and Waldemar became co-ruler with his youngest nephew John II.
Six years later, Waldemar died, leaving his only son Waldemar II as the new co-ruler with John II.

Her paternal grandmother Agnes of Habsburg was a daughter of Rudolph I, Holy Roman Emperor. The spouses were distantly related: Elisabeth's great-grandfather Albert I, Duke of Saxony, was a brother of Henry I, Count of Anhalt, Waldemar's great-great-grandfather. They had six children:
In 1365 Waldemar married for a second time to Beatrice (d. 1387), legitimized daughter of Obizzo III d'Este, Lord of Ferrara and Modena by his second wife and former mistress Lippa Ariosto. This union was childless.

Paul Williams (author)

Paul Williams (born Paul Edward Williams, 15 January 1967, York, England) is an author, commentator and lifelong devotee to 2-Tone, ska music and the British skinhead subculture. He is best known for writing the book "You're Wondering Now - A History of The Specials" which was published by ST Publishing.
Williams' love of ska and 2 Tone started in 1980, when he sneaked out of his parents' home in York and travelled to nearby Bridlington, where he saw The Specials perform live when he was 13 years old. This event had a long-lasting and profound effect on him. Throughout the late 80s Williams was a regular visitor at the "Pressure Drop" ska nights in York. In the 1990s, he created, wrote and distributed his own quarterly ska and 2 Tone fanzine "Street Feeling" (1994-1998) from his back bedroom. In 1995, Williams wrote "You're Wondering Now - A History of The Specials" (ST Publishing). It received a few reviews in the media, including three stars from "Q Magazine", and was used to compile the band history section on the official Specials website. The book is now a collectors' item. 
Williams describes himself as a 'ska specialist', often consulting with media outlets including TV companies such as VH1(satellite) and Channel 4(UK terrestrial TV). He has been featured on BBC4 Radio's celebration of 2-Tone music, "Fashion Music" and was interviewed by Radio Coventry for which he contributed rare Specials tracks to the programme. His work can now be seen online, as the co-administrator for the Specials fansite and as the administrator for Roddy "Radiation" Byers' My Space profile. He designed and maintained the Ska Splash website, which was a ska festival that took place in Skegness in 2008. Williams has also promoted a handful of ska nights in his hometown of York at The Junction pub under the banner of "YorkSka Promotions".

The F. L. Ames Gardener's Cottage is a small residential house in North Easton, Massachusetts. This building was designed in 1884 by noted American architect Henry Hobson Richardson and built the following year. This building sits on the original Ames estate and was designed soon after the neighboring Ames Gate Lodge (also a Richardson design). Fredrick L. Ames also commissioned Richardson to build the nearby Old Colony Railroad Station. Two other notable buildings in North Easton, the Ames Free Library and Oakes Ames Memorial Hall, were also Richardson designs and commissioned by the Ames family.
The exterior of the Gardener's house has been renovated and is not easily identified as a Richardson building. However the footprint and structure remain intact, including a circular tower on one corner of the house.

Aimee Walker Pond

Aimee Patricia Walker Pond (born March 10, 1983) is a United States gymnast. A graduate of Brigham Young University, Pond has been involved in gymnastics since the age of eight. She is completely deaf and is blind in her right eye, making her one of a very few disabled gymnasts who have competed at the national level (another is Marie Roethlisberger). Some have compared her to Helen Keller to which Pond has responded "She's so wonderful, but I am glad I'm not Helen Keller, I'm so lucky- I have my one eye."
Born Aimee Patricia Walker in Tarzana, California, Pond is her married name.
When Pond was seven years old, she watched her cousins practicing at a gymnastics center, and asked her mother if she could take classes with them. The trainer rejected Pond because of her deafness, stating that she would not know how to communicate with or coach a deaf gymnast. At age eight, her mother enrolled her in classes, instructing her not to use sign language in front of anyone. After the coach noticed Pond did not respond when spoken to, she talked to Pond's mother and said she would like Pond to be on the team.
Pond is a Latter-day Saint. She graduated from Mountain View High School in Orem, Utah. She had transferred there from California to be near her coach Mary Wright, and her parents lived in Valley Village, California at that time.
Pond began her college career as a gymnast at the University of California, Los Angeles. She transferred to BYU in 2005, redshirted a year, and then competed in 2006 and 2007. Walker did not compete in 2008 due to a shoulder injury.
Aimee Walker Pond has competed at the national and international level in addition to her collegiate experiences. At the Junior Olympic National Championships in 1999, she placed 19th overall with event placements of 6th on floor and 9th on bars. Her career high scores are a 9.715 on vault, earned February 2, 2006, and a 9.825 on bars, earned March 9, 2007. She did not compete during the 2008 season due to a shoulder injury.
At age 14, Pond had a cameo appearance in the movie "Little Girls in Pretty Boxes". Today she enjoys hiking, basketball, and spending time with her family, including her husband Derek Pond. She hopes to coach gymnastics and especially wishes to inspire other deaf gymnasts to succeed at advanced levels.
Aimee Pond was one of the listed performers on Harris Communications' "Sign and Sing" DVD of songs in sign language.

Les Harrop

Les Harrop, born 1948, is an English and Australian writer, editor, and teacher.
Background.
Born at either Darwen or Blackpool (sources differ) in the English northwest, Harrop grew up speaking East Lancashire dialect in a working-class household on the edge of the Pennines. He was the middle one of three brothers. His father was a kilnsman and artisan tilemaker whose family had been numerous about Mottram-in-Longdendale for centuries; and his mother was a mill girl who however was intellectually ambitious and eloquent in her detestation of the weaving shed. Her forebears had come over to Lancashire from Limerick in the Hungry Forties.
The father served as a stoker below decks in the Royal Navy throughout the Second War; he was present in the successful pursuit of the Bismarck and afterwards on supply convoys to Murmansk and Archangel. He is said to have been torpedoed twice and to have returned from the war an altered man. It seems he was not welcomed back by his socially conscious wife. The marriage struggled on but Harrop's parents separated for good in 1956 when the boy was eight. He hardly saw his much-loved father thereafter, and when they did meet again the circumstances were awkward and an estrangement had grown between them.
Education.
Harrop won a scholarship to a boarding school, and after eight years at a school whose curriculum had been Latin-based since the Middle Ages, and which he has compared both to a prison camp and to a dog-training institute, he progressed to Queen Mary College in the University of London. There he studied English Language and Literature (B.A., 1971) - for two years under the playwright Simon Gray. He transferred to King's College, Cambridge, but after his years during the 1960s in the Mile End Road and Fitzrovia, that ancient institution seemed, Harrop thought, "theatrical, less than fully grown up" and "a lot like more boarding school". At Cambridge he was mostly untouched by the afterglow of Maynard Keynes, E.M. Forster and Leavis, but was struck again by the strength of his inherited proletarian culture; his shyness seems to have hardened into a conscious distaste for bourgeois careerism (Marxist thought was still influential in the West at that date).
He'd found a job through Gabbitas Thring at Arnold House School in St. John's Wood. After this spell as a teacher he went on a Killam Scholarship for postgraduate study to Canada — Social History at Dalhousie, Nova Scotia (M.A., 1974). There he had rewarding supervision from Rowland Smith, a South African whose interest was Wyndham Lewis and the political writers of the 1930s. Harrop ran into difficulties over the unwanted attentions of a homosexual instructor — as he has detailed in his essay 'After Tea with Dr. Hartley' — and he completed his Master's at the University of Toronto.
Travels.
He lived for nine months in Clermont-Ferrand, improving his French, and learned some German at Innsbruck, where he stayed with the family of the university librarian. He travelled much of Africa on a shoestring in the mid 1970s, from Casablanca to the Cape, and "dawdled" in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) at the time of minority white rule. After 1977 he settled in Australia with Nilofar Rizvi, a Calcutta-born and London-educated doctor from a part-Muslim family: his longtime partner and the mother of his two older sons. The couple acquired joint British and Australian citizenship about 1980.
In Melbourne, Harrop was poetry editor for Overland and founded the arts journal Helix (Canberra then Melbourne then Santa Barbara), which broke new ground in contesting the narrow nationalist agenda of literary Australia in the late 1970s. He completed his doctorate at the University of Melbourne with a psychological study of postwar poetry (1981). He was offered through Chris Wallace-Crabbe the Lockie Fellowship in creative writing at that university, but accepted instead a lectureship at the University of California. He afterwards returned to teach at Melbourne and other Australian universities and was, according to former students, magnetic and popular in that role. For all that, and despite having warmed to his American students, he remained restless in academic life. It continued to strike him as fundamentally unserious: chiefly a middle-class struggle for jobs - which impression was not altered by the inrush during those years of Theory over the top of traditional literary studies.
ASIO.
While on leave in Australia about 1986 he responded to an advertisement for a "government research officer", and found himself being interviewed in St. Kilda Road by employees of ASIO (the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation). Thereafter he dropped from sight for most of a decade, during which he trained as a specialist in southern Asia.
Harrop's first book of poems and the only book he has published in Australia was The Hum of the Old Suit (1979), winner of the Anne Elder Award. When he resurfaced he was living at his former address in Melbourne, and writing fiction. His novels Knight Galah and A Quarter in Tartary were shortlisted for the Angus & Robertson prize in 1994 and 1995 respectively. At about that time too he organised and began running the Melbourne Writers Group, which helped serious readers and would-be writers to get to grips with some mysteries of literary craft.
Uneasy Retirement.
Harrop has since retired from teaching and has devoted himself mostly to historical research and to writing about his native district, where his ruminations have permanent residence. The results are contained in his Lancashire Companion (a discursive encyclopaedia), in As It Were and Obedience Training (childhood and boarding-school memoirs). Harrop has never married though he is the father of three interesting sons. He has twice been conveyed through the Family Court of Australia, and his second encounter with the court appeared to affect his health and, according to his friends, undermined him for a time. It also projected him, perhaps against his finer judgement, into a wide-ranging and still incomplete study of modern feminism with the cumbersome working title: 'Eunox to your Clitorarchs Came'. The 'Eunox' is explained by the fact that Harrop has lived so long in the birth city of the Female Eunuch.
This endeavour well illustrates the independence and incisiveness of his views on broad social questions, especially on the sex wars and the gender issue. It sets him apart from other progressive intellectuals of his generation. It's a book which may not win him friends, nor endear him to any influential current readership. It may indeed be enough to damn his work hereafter. On the other hand such a study could come into its own once our prevailing gender bitterness has assumed its place as an historical curiosity. 'Eunox' ('cultural reclamation in the feminist twilight') sounds like a sturdy defence of common experience in the face of what it views as imperious female fantasies. It is a conscious, intelligent 'backlash' book which has not, so far as is known, become available publicly.
Nor have the many poems and occasional pieces which Harrop has by all accounts continued to produce over the second half of his life. He has sometimes printed these, for unidentified reasons, under anagrammatic pen names: 'Pearl Shirloe', 'Hollis Reaper' and the like.
Style And Heroes.
Harrop's verse and fiction are characterised by physicality, by increasing technical sureness and a chaste, particular style. His discursive writing is trenchant if outré (he has been a close student of industrial-age social critics such as Carlyle, Arnold and Ruskin). The unhappiness of his personal life has perhaps made it easier for him to maintain the hypersensitive, pained innocence which marks all his writing and which, when allied to his eccentricity of opinion, will seem unpalatable to those who insist on a light quiche-and-salad in preference to strong meat. His emotional directness can jar on occasion, and can be prey to a certain linguistic excess, which seems strangely Victorian in one who has an evident admiration for Imagism, for the 'masculine' style of early Hemingway or of Faulkner's As I Lay Dying, and whose chief reading lies among their modern successors male and female (Beckett is a hero of his, and contemporary favourites include Coetzee and Mantel). It is surprising — or perhaps not — that such a fastidious, self-effacing person should wield such a heavy bludgeon on the page.
Harrop was raised an Anglican but has said that compulsory churchgoing relieved him in childhood of all religious faith. (He cites "a priest in women's dress, a haughty congregation and the evil temper of my choirmaster" in explanation of his atheism.) In late 2008 he moved out of "feminised Melbourne" (his phrase) to live in the nearby mountains; but within two months he was burned from this fastness by the bushfires that took so many lives. Abandoning his extensive library, he has renewed his commitment to writing since that catastrophe, settling in his sixties with his third son at a Pashtoun village about a day's journey from Lahore, Pakistan.

Cuisine of Vanuatu

The cuisine of Vanuatu (known in Bislama as "aelan kakae") incorporates fish, root vegetables such as taro and yams, fruits, and vegetables. Most island families grow food in their gardens, and food shortages are rare. Papayas, pineapples, mangoes, plantains, and sweet potatoes are abundant through much of the year. Coconut milk and cream are used to flavor many dishes. Most food is cooked using hot stones or through boiling and steaming; little food is fried. 
Kava, a traditional non-alcoholic drink, is extremely popular in Vanuatu. Once a prestigious beverage brewed from "Piper methysticum", it is commonly drunk at dusk, before dinner, mostly by men but increasingly by women. While it has mild narcotic and relaxing effects on the individual, it is mostly appreciated for the relaxed social atmosphere it is traditionally associated with, both in urban and rural areas, in the context of the "nakamal".
The national dish of Vanuatu is the lap lap.

1958 Chatham Cup

The 1958 Chatham Cup was the 31st annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds.
Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Eastern Suburbs (Auckland), Rangers (Bay of Plenty), Hamilton Wanderers, Eastern Union (Gisborne), Stratford, Colenso Athletic (Hawkes Bay), Wanganui Athletic, Kiwi United (Manawatu), Lansdowne United (Wairarapa), Seatoun, Christchurch City, Oamaru, and Northern (Dunedin).
The 1958 final.
In the final, Seatoun set a finals record by scoring seven goals, six of them from centre-forward John Donovan. Both of these feats are still cup records, though Seatoun's seven goal haul was equalled by Christchurch United in 1989. The aggregate of eight goals in the final equalled the record first set in 1940. 
Donovan was supplied with a good series of crosses from his wings. The Wellington side battled into the wind during the first half, which remained scoreless for over half an hour before a late flurry of goals. Donovan opened his account after 37 minutes, and the score remained at 1-0 until three minutes before the break. Donovan and Raymond Wright then scored in quick succession, only to have Ken Giblett pull the score back to 3-1 with the last kick of the half. The second half was a one-man show, with Donovan taking the score from 3-1 to 7-1, three of the goals coming from headers. His remarkable record of a final double-hat-trick still stands .
The final was notable in another way, as it was the first time that substitutes had been used in a Chatham Cup final. Neil Kerr (Seatoun) and Ken Giblett (City) were the first two substitutes to make finals appearances.

Shopworn

Shopworn is a 1932 American Pre-Code romantic drama film directed by Nick Grinde and starring Barbara Stanwyck and Regis Toomey. Written by Jo Swerling and Robert Riskin, based on a story by Sarah Y. Mason, the film is about a poor hardworking waitress who meets and falls in love with a wealthy college student. His mother objects to the union and frames the waitress for a crime she did not commit. After serving her time, the waitress enters show business and becomes a star.
Plot.
Waitress Kitty Lane (Stanwyck) and wealthy David Livingston (Toomey) fall in love. However his overly protective mother Helen (Clara Blandick) does not approve and does everything she can to break them up. She has her friend Judge Forbes (Oscar Apfel) first try bribery; when that fails, he arranges to have her jailed on a bogus morals charge. Meanwhile, Mrs. Livingston convinces her son that Kitty took the $5000 bribe.
As the years pass, Kitty becomes a successful showgirl, with numerous admirers, while David is a doctor. When their paths cross again, their love is rekindled, though Kitty is skeptical of David's resolve in the face of his mother's unwavering opposition. David finally convinces her to marry him.
Alarmed, Mrs. Livingston goes to see Kitty. She begs her to break off the engagement, fearing her son's career will be ruined, but Kitty is unmoved. In desperation, the distraught mother pulls out a gun. Kitty manages to take it away from the confused woman, but is touched by her pleas. When David shows up, Mrs. Livingston hides while Kitty puts on an act, pretending that she only agreed to marry him to get back at his mother. David is finally convinced, but then a repentant Mrs. Livingston stops him from leaving and confesses the truth.
Critical response.
In his review for the "New York Times", Mordaunt Hall wrote that despite the performances of the actors, the film was "tedious":

Robert Klippel

Robert Klippel AO (19 June 192019 June 2001) was an Australian constructivist sculptor and teacher. He is often described in contemporary art literature as Australia's greatest sculptor. Throughout his career he produced some 1,300 pieces of sculpture and approximately 5,000 drawings.
Biography.
Klippel was born in Potts Point, Sydney on 19 June 1920. At the age of six he made his first model ship after being taken on a ferry ride on Sydney Harbour. Model making became a passion. He trained to work in the wool industry but in 1939 he joined the Royal Australian Navy. He was employed to make models of planes while he was serving in the Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships at the Gunnery Instruction Centre during World War II.
While working at the centre he was able to attend evening classes in sculpture under Lyndon Dadswell at East Sydney Technical College and after his military discharge, was able to attend for a full year.
His parents' business was successful and with their support, he left Australia in 1947 to study at the Slade School of Fine Art where he remained for six months. He lived and painted at The Abbey Arts Centre in New Barnet, London, along with artists Leonard French, James Gleeson, Peter Benjamin Graham, Douglas Green, Stacha Halpern, Grahame King and Inge King. In November 1948, Klippel, Gleeson and the young Lucian Freud exhibited together in London. André Breton, the originator of Surrealism, arranged for Klippel's work to be exhibited in Paris the following year.
He spent a year in Paris where he attended lectures by Jiddu Krishnamurti. This strengthened a lifelong interest in Eastern religion and philosophy, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Zen. After 18 months in Paris, Klippel returned to Australia in 1950.
In 1957 he sailed to the United States, living in New York in 1957. He taught sculpture at the Minneapolis School of Art (now the Minneapolis College of Art and Design) from 1958 to 1962 and returned to New York until 1963. He then returned to Sydney, where he remained until his death. He taught at Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education from 1975 to 1979
In 1988 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for his services to art.
He died in Sydney on his 81st birthday, 19 June 2001.
Work.
Klippel's work commonly utilized an extraordinary diversity of junk materials: wood, stone, plastic toy kits, wooden pattern parts, typewriter machinery, industrial piping and machine parts, as well as bronze, silver, oils, photography, collage and paper. He is also notable for the great diversity of scale of his work, from intricate whimsical structures in metal to the large wooden assemblages of the 1980s. His mature work was usually untitled, being distinguished by simple number sequences.
While in London, he met other expatriate Australians including the surrealist painter James Gleeson. The two collaborated on several works, including ‘Madame Sophie Sesostoris’ (1947–48), a Pre-Raphaelite satire, combining Klippel's sculpture with Gleeson's painting. For a time, Klippel embraced the surrealist ethic, exhibiting at a major surrealist show and meeting André Breton.
During his time in London, he began a series of drawings and filled his notebooks with analytical diagrams of organic and mechanical objects, everything from screws and cogs to insects and shells, and making detailed drawings of the anthropomorphic forms used by artists such as Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso. Whereas Moore had related the human figure to the forms of nature, Klippel set out to relate the forms of nature to the shapes and forms of machinery in an industrial society. He made the statement that he wished "to seek the inter-relationship between the cogwheel and the bud."
By the time Klippel returned to Sydney in 1950, he was committed to construction as a method and was producing totally abstract sculptures. His work was received with little enthusiasm in Australia at first, with his first sculptural work was not selling in his country until 1956. Forced to work full-time, his production dropped to a mere 18 pieces between 1950 and 1957.
By the 1950s Klippel had grown apart from the surrealists and in New York he was invigorated by the rise of abstract expressionism and the New York School. He moved away increasingly from traditional sculpture and produced his first junk assemblages in 1960. He began incorporating machine parts, pieces of wood and industrial piping into his works.
In 1964, art critic Robert Hughes called Klippel "one of the few Australian sculptors worthy of international attention". The statement cemented his international reputation, but he struggled to win acceptance in his own country. During the 1970s and '80s, when the traditional distinctions between sculpture and architecture, design, photography, performance and painting were frequently presented as obsolete, Klippel remained committed to the idea of sculpture as abstract, as occupying sculptural space, and as sustaining in ways beyond literary or narrative function.
Klippel's last decades were extremely prolific. In the 1980s he completed a major series of small bronzes, as well as a large number of monumental wooden assemblages, made from the pattern-parts of early twentieth century maritime machinery. Working with wood, metals, plastics, junk, machinery parts, oils, watercolours and paper, and utilising the techniques of casting, assemblage, painting and collage, he had completed over 1,200 sculptures by the end of the 1990s.
A documentary film, "Make It New: A Portrait of the Sculptor Robert Klippel", was produced in 1992.

<doc id="18958074" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18958074" title="Closure (business)">
Closure (business)

Closure is the term used to refer to the actions necessary when it is no longer necessary or possible for a business or other organization to continue to operate. Closure may be the result of a bankruptcy, where the organization lacks sufficient funds to continue operations, as a result of the proprietor of the business dying, as a result of a business being purchased by another organization (or a competitor) and shut down as superfluous, or because it is the non-surviving entity in a corporate merger. A closure may occur because the purpose for which the organization was created is no longer necessary.
While a closure is typically of a business or a non-profit organization, any entity which is created by human beings can be subject to a closure, from a single church to a whole religion, up to and including an entire country if, for some reason, it ceases to exist.
Closures are of two types, voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary closures of organizations are much rarer than involuntary ones, as, in the absence of some change making operations impossible or unnecessary, most operations will continue until something happens that causes a change requiring this situation.
The most common form of voluntary closure would be when those involved in an organization such as a social club, a band, or other non-profit organization decide to cease operating. Once the organization has paid any outstanding debts and completed any pending operations, closure may simply mean that the organization ceases to exist.
If an organization has debts that cannot be paid, it may be necessary to perform a liquidation of its assets. If there is anything left after the assets are converted to cash, in the case of a for-profit organization, the remainder is distributed to the stockholders; in the case of a non-profit, by law any remaining assets must be distributed to another non-profit.
If an organization has more debts than assets, it may have to declare bankruptcy. If the organization is viable, it may reorganizes itself as a result of the bankruptcy and continue operations. If it is not viable for the business to continue operating, then a closure occurs through a bankruptcy liquidation: its assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid from whatever assets could be liquidated, and the business ceases operations.
Possibly the largest "closure" in history (but more closely analogous to a demerger) was the split of the Soviet Union into its constituent countries. In comparison, the end of East Germany can be considered a merger rather than a closure as West Germany assumed all of the assets and liabilities of East Germany. The end of the Soviet Union was the equivalent of a closure through a bankruptcy liquidation, because while Russia assumed most of the assets and responsibilities of the former Soviet Union, it did not assume all of them. There have been issues over who is responsible for unpaid parking tickets accumulated by motor vehicles operated on behalf of diplomatic missions operated by the former Soviet Union in other countries, as Russia claims it is not responsible for them.
Several major business closures include the bankruptcy of the Penn Central railroad, the Enron scandals, and MCI Worldcom's bankruptcy and eventual merger into Verizon.

With fastball which tops out at 121 km/h (75.19 mph), she is widely recognized as the fastest pitcher in women's softball. 
Episodes.
Rivalry With the U.S..
In 2006 World Women's Softball Championship in Beijing, she shut out the U.S. team in the semifinal but was knocked out and lost the game in the final against the same U.S. team. In 2008 Summer Olympics, she again lost to the U.S. in the playoff allowing four runs in the tiebreak ninth inning, after shutting out the opponent until the previous inning. Yet she wins the final against the same U.S. by pitching her fifth complete game, allowing only one run in seven innings.
Perseverance at the 2008 Olympics.
She pitched over 600 balls at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics in 4 days (413 in the last two days during which she completed three games). During the semi-final and final games of the softball event, which lasted for two days and included three games, Ueno pitched 28 innings against the United States and Australia, considered the two best lineups in the world. NBC commentator Rob Baird described Ueno's feat as "one of the most amazing pitching performances in recent memory."
Unessential Listening.
The pronunciation of Ueno's surname was brought to the attention of comedy duo Hamish & Andy during the Olympics. This was due to the name being very similar to a stereotypical Australian or Strine nickname for Wayne, 'Wayno'. It also is pronounced exactly the same way to national baseball pitcher, Wayne Ough. 
The segment was included on their compilation album Unessential Listening.

Funhouse (Pink album)

Funhouse is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Pink, released by LaFace Records worldwide in October 24, 2008. The album debuted at number two on the "Billboard" 200 chart, selling 180,000 copies in its first week and reached number one on the charts in six countries including Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
Singles from the album include the U.S. number-one single "So What", "Sober", "Please Don't Leave Me", "Funhouse", "I Don't Believe You", and "Glitter in the Air". "Funhouse" earned Pink three Grammy Award nominations and five MTV Video Music Award nominations. "Funhouse" was re-released in late 2009 to include a bonus DVD, and was accompanied by the release of "", a live album taped during Pink's Australian leg of the Funhouse Tour.
Writing and development.
Pink has stated that this album is her most vulnerable to date. Much of the album's subject matter alludes to the fact that Moore had recently separated from her husband, Carey Hart. The first single, "So What", opens with: "I guess I just lost my husband/I don't know where he went". "Please Don't Leave Me" also addresses the split. The artist sums up its theme thus: "Okay, I’m an asshole, but love me anyway." In "Mean", she sings, "It was good in the beginning/but how did we get so mean?"
The song that Moore is the most proud of is "Crystal Ball". She said about the track: "I recorded it in one take and we didn’t mix it. It just went straight to master. It was all about a vibe and not about perfection or being polished. I just love that song and I loved recording it." She wrote the song with Billy Mann, who also aided her with the songs "Stupid Girls", "Dear Mr. President" and "I'm Not Dead" (all 2006), among others.
In "It's All Your Fault", Pink blames her lover for giving her hopes of a love relationship, then simply giving up on her. She proclaims in the lyrics "I conjure up the thought of being gone, but I’d probably even do that wrong." In "Glitter in the Air", Pink asks many questions such as, "Have you ever looked fear in the face and said I just don’t care?", and "Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?" Pink admits, "I still don’t have some of the answers to the questions I pose on this record. I’m still figuring it all out."
The track "Sober", which is the album's second single, was written by Pink at a party hosted at her home, where everyone was drunk or drinking except for her, and she wanted them all to leave. She went to the beach and had a line in her head saying "How do I feel so good sober?". Eventually it had nothing to do with alcohol but with identities. "How do I feel so good with just me, without anyone to lean on?", Pink said in an interview.
"Ave Mary A" deals with world issues and problems. "One Foot Wrong" talks about an acid trip that went wrong, but also has an underlying theme. "That song is also about losing control and how easy it is to lose the plot in life and teeter on the edge."
Originally, Pink wanted to call her album "Heartbreak Is a Motherfucker", but her record label declined because of a fear that offensive language would affect sales. She also said that she did not want the album to look like a break-up album; "There is a lot of that but there is fun happening too and that's why I named it "Funhouse" in the end." Pink has also stated that she sees life as a carnival: "Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun, but really they are kind of creepy." [... "and that's like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can sometimes be really scary. And the funhouse mirrors that make you look so distorted that you don’t recognize yourself and you ask yourself, ‘How did I get here? How do I get out of here?’ But, you think that you want to do it again. That is the same as love and life. It's a metaphor for being in love and for life." This also shows in the title track "Funhouse" where she tells that it used to be fun. "It's about when the box you’re in doesn’t fit anymore, burn that fucker down and start a new one."
Recording.
Pink wrote and recorded approximately 30 to 35 songs for "Funhouse". "It's like getting rid of your children: 'I like that one too, but I'm going to let that one die,'" she said of choosing the album's tracks. "The good thing now is that different countries want extra songs and B-sides, so there's always a home for the other kids."
Pink traveled internationally to write and record the album, working with Eg White in London and with Max Martin in Stockholm. "It was really good to get out of my house and get away from my life. No distractions. No phones", Pink said of her sessions outside the U.S.
Critical reception.
The album has a score of 69 out of 100 from Metacritic based on 20 "generally favorable" reviews. Sydney's "The Daily Telegraph" gave it 4.5 stars, writing, "The record is a balanced blend of upbeat pop gems and midtempo ballads [...] The power of Pink's pop lies in the clever juxtaposition of heartfelt honesty about her life with anthematic choruses and irresistible melodies tailormade to be screamed out by her fans."
Other positive reviews were published by "US Magazine", which gave the album four stars, saying "The rebellious Grammy winner again fuses unrestrained lyrics with perfect pop-rock hooks on her electrifying fifth CD. From her aggressive No. 1 hit 'So What' to the vulnerable 'Please Don't Leave Me' and the openhearted ballad 'I Don't Believe You', Pink confirms she's still in excellent fighting shape." In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau picked out the single from the album, "So What", as a "choice cut".
Less favorable reviews came from sources such as "Rolling Stone" and "Blender", each giving the album three stars. "Rolling Stone" stated, "Pink has shown more personality before, and some cuts, including the goopy ballad "I Don't Believe You", make her sound like just another big-voiced chart-buster. "Funhouse" would be more fun if Pink went easier on the bad-love songs."
Chart performance.
Four versions of "Funhouse" were released to the U.S. iTunes Store: two versions of the original, one explicit and one clean; two versions of the deluxe, one explicit and one clean.

The Woman's Club of Fayetteville

The Woman's Club of Fayetteville is a charitable society founded in 1906 in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The Club is responsible for the first library in Fayetteville and Cumberland County, North Carolina. The Woman's Club is located in Fayetteville's Heritage Square and is dedicated to its restoration and preservation. 
History.
The Woman’s Club of Fayetteville was founded on November 6, 1906, as the Civic Improvement Association (a.k.a. Woman's Civic Improvement League). Originally, its goal was to protest the proposed destruction of the Market House, a historical city building. According to club literature, it wasn't until 1920 that it was named "The Woman's Club".
The club is responsible for the first library in Fayetteville, launched between 1907 and 1910 on the second floor of the Market House. Private donations filled the shelves until the 1910 book reception from which the available book number rose to 725 books. At that time, subscription rates were $2.00/family, $1.50 for individuals, and $0.50 for children. The library became public (and free for all Cumberland county residents) on December 18, 1933.
During World War II, the Woman's Club opened their doors to provide a home for unmarried working women flooding into the city at that time. Thirty young, single women, a housemother and hostess packed the four bedrooms with dormitory type furniture to serve their needs. The Woman's Club also provided space for any other women's organization to meet in the house free of charge in an effort to accommodate the town's growing need for social outlets.
In 1941, the club purchased the "Slocumb House" but later renamed it the "Sandford House." Thirty years later, the club petitioned the National Register of Historic Places to make the Sandford House, the Oval Ballroom (a relocated free-standing room), and the Nimocks House historic landmarks. All three buildings are located on Heritage Square in Fayetteville. In 1972 and 1973, the petitions were granted. Today, the club restores and maintains these historic landmarks on Heritage Square, open to the public by appointment.
Maintenance and restoration projects.
Today, the Woman's Club restores and preserves Fayetteville's Heritage Square. The three buildings that comprise Heritage Square are on the National Register of Historic Places in the United States. 
According to the 2007-2008 Woman's Club president, the club works to preserve Heritage Square with no government grants. During 2007, repairs such as painting to historical standards and replacing structural beams were completed at a cost of over $100,000. Restoration of the Nimocks House and gardens follow.

Heritage Square (Fayetteville, North Carolina)

Heritage Square is a place in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Owned and maintained by The Woman's Club of Fayetteville, Heritage Square includes the Sandford House, built in 1797; the Oval Ballroom, a freestanding single room built in 1818; and the Baker-Haigh-Nimocks House, constructed in 1804. The buildings located on Heritage Square are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
Captain John E.P. Daingerfield.
After the Civil War, ex-Confederate Captain John E.P. Daingerfield (originally from Arkansas) bought the property.
Daingerfield served as a Confederate clerk at the Harpers Ferry arsenal in 1859 during John Brown’s raid. Captain Daingerfield took rank June 10, 1861 and transferred to Fayetteville as munitions and equipment were transferred to the Fayetteville Arsenal from Harpers Ferry that same year.
Maj. John C. Booth, commanding officer at the Fayetteville Arsenal, appointed him military paymaster and storekeeper, prestigious jobs in the Army. Daingerfield served in the 2nd Battalion Local Defense Troops, commonly referred to as the Arsenal Guard, and occupied the house with his wife Matilda and his four children - one of whom became a celebrated painter of North Carolina.
Elliot Daingerfield.
Elliot Daingerfield was born in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and raised in Fayetteville. At age 21 he moved to New York to study art. Elliot was inspired by the European Symbolist movement during his time overseas. His influences included Impressionism and Romanticism in general and the artist Ralph Albert Blakelock. Today, the "Daingerfield Room" occupies the entire South Parlor of the Sandford House.
The Woman's Club of Fayetteville.
The Woman's Club rented the Sandford House from 1941-1945 to provide a home for unmarried working women flooding into the city during World War II. At one time, 30 young, single women, a housemother and hostess packed the second floor bedrooms which were converted into dormitory style living spaces. The Woman's Club also provided space for any other women's organization to meet in the house free of charge in an effort to accommodate the town's growing need for social outlets.
The Oval Ballroom.
The Oval Ballroom is now a freestanding room with octagonal architecture outside and a large (20'x30') oval interior highlighted by plaster cornices and pilasters. Originally, the ballroom was an add-on to the Halliday-Williams House in Fayetteville, NC; the Halliday-Williams House was demolished in the mid-1950s. The Oval Ballroom is an example of Regency architecture.
Historical Ownership of the Oval Ballroom.
Mrs. Ann K. Simpson.
Ann K. Simpson, accused of murdering her husband, was the first woman tried for murder in Cumberland County, North Carolina. She was found not guilty in this trial. However, Ann was found guilty and executed when she stood trial for murdering her "third" husband while living in Michigan. During the Michigan trial, the early, untimely death of her second husband was also called into question.
"The Oval Ballroom" is the dining area in which Ann served her first husband his (allegedly) arsenic-laced dessert of syllabub and coffee in the presence of two witnesses.
Fanny "Fan" Williams.
Fan Williams operated The Colonial Inn, known for its southern cuisine and hospitality.
Nimocks House.
Exterior.
The Baker-Haigh-Nimocks House, built in 1804, is an example of Georgian architecture, perfectly balanced and symmetrical inside and out. The Nimocks House exhibits a proportional, classical, and "regular" style. "Regular" styles are defined by mathematical ratios (such as the golden mean) that are used to determine every measurement from the floor layout to the width to height ratio of the windows. Georgian Style homes were typically painted red, tan, and/or white if not constructed from brick or stone.
Interior.
New England ship builders often wintered in the south during this time period. Their unique building style probably explains the unusual barrel staircase design in the Nimocks House. In addition, the hand carved cornices, wainscoting, mantels, and hand-punched gouge work are beautifully detailed and typical of the period.
The front entrance features a fan light and the light fixture at the top of the staircase was planned for use in the state capital building if Fayetteville had remained the capital.
The two upstairs rooms feature dormer windows and individual fireplaces.

WJBE (AM)

WJBE (1040 AM) is an American commercial daytime-only radio station located in Powell, Tennessee, serving the Knoxville Metropolitan Area with an urban adult contemporary format. WJBE is owned by Joseph Armstrong, through broadcast licensee Arm & Rage, LLC. This station is unrelated to the Knoxville-based WJBE owned by entertainer James Brown from 1968 through 1979.
History.
This station played adult standards for much of its history and was owned by Journal Communications through most of the period after the Telecommunications Act of 1996, though it was a sports talk station ("1040 The Ticket") before switching to the Dial Global America's Best Music network in its last change before switching to its current format. The station was also formerly simulcast on 104.5 FM.
Because it shares the same frequency as "clear channel" station WHO-AM in Des Moines, Iowa, WJBE operates as a daytime-only station.
On November 13, 2008, the station's call sign changed from WQBB to WKTI, branded as Classic Country 1040 WKTI; the new calls came from Journal Communications' former adult contemporary station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at 94.5 FM (now known as WLWK-FM).
On December 3, 2012, the station was sold by Journal to WMCH Radio, Inc., in order to meet regulatory requirements after purchasing WACY-TV in Appleton, Wisconsin. Subsequently the call sign was changed to WWAM, with the WKTI calls moving back to Wisconsin on a Sturgeon Bay-based translator on Channel 22 of WWAM's former sister television station WGBA-TV (Channel 26) in Green Bay. WWAM changed to urban adult contemporary with the sale.
Effective May 7, 2013, WWAM was sold to Joseph Armstrong's Arm & Rage, LLC at a purchase price of $75,532.50. The station changed its call sign to the current WJBE on June 28, 2013.

Massachusetts World War II Army Airfields

During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) established numerous airfields in Massachusetts for training pilots and aircrews of USAAF fighters and bombers.
Most of these airfields were under the command of First Air Force or the Army Air Forces Training Command (AAFTC) (A predecessor of the current-day United States Air Force Air Education and Training Command). However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.
It is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.

List of Michigan World War II Army Airfields

During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) established numerous airfields in Michigan for training pilots and aircrews of USAAF fighters and bombers.
Most of these airfields were under the command of First Air Force or the Army Air Forces Training Command (AAFTC) (A predecessor of the current-day United States Air Force Air Education and Training Command). However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.
It is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.

BBC Manchester

BBC Manchester (often known as BBC Salford) is the British Broadcasting Corporation regional headquarters for the North West, the largest BBC region in the UK. BBC Manchester is a department of the BBC North Group division.
The BBC considers the Manchester department as one of its three main national bases alongside London and Bristol has had a presence in the city since launching the 2ZY radio station in 1922. The BBC had its first studio outside of London in 1954 when the Corporation leased the Dickenson Road Studios. In 1967, the decision was taken to build a purpose-built BBC building in Manchester on Oxford Road which opened in 1976.
Manchester's television industry struggled during the early 2000s when Granada Television reduced operations in Manchester with the newly formed ITV opting to move operations to London which meant New Broadcasting House and Granada Studios were underused. BBC Television Centre in London, Granada Studios and New Broadcasting House in Manchester were all coming to the end of their operational span and the BBC decided to transfer more departments north, preferably to Manchester where they have been based for 90 years. The move would aim to boost the ailing Manchester media industry, lower operational costs compared to London and represent the north of England more proportionally. 
The BBC decided on moving to Media City in Salford Quays, a short distance outside the city centre. BBC Manchester transferred from New Broadcasting House but still maintains Granada Studios with ITV.
History.
Manchester was home to the BBC's first studio outside of London in 1954 with the acquisition of Dickenson Road Studios in Rusholme, which was a converted church. The BBC formed BBC Manchester in the 1950s and the Manchester department bought the studios from Mancunian Films. The BBC expanded to form another production centre, BBC Piccadilly Studios in Manchester city centre in 1957. This production centre remained until 1975 when facilities moved to New Broadcasting House.
The studios were famous for "Top of the Pops" which began filming on New Year's Day 1964 in Studio A at the Dickenson Road Studios. DJs Jimmy Savile and Alan Freeman presented the first show, which featured (in order) The Rolling Stones with "I Wanna Be Your Man", Dusty Springfield with "I Only Want to Be with You", the Dave Clark Five with "Glad All Over", The Hollies with "Stay", The Swinging Blue Jeans with "Hippy Hippy Shake" and The Beatles with "I Want to Hold Your Hand", that week's number one (throughout its history, the programme always finished with the best-selling single of the week). For the first three years Savile rotated with three other presenters: Alan Freeman, Pete Murray and David Jacobs. A Mancunian model, Samantha Juste, was the regular "disc girl". Local photographer Harry Goodwin was hired to provide shots of non-appearing artists, and also to provide backdrops for the chart rundown. He would continue in the role until 1973.
In 1972, local broadcaster Stuart Hall hosted "It's a Knockout". Stuart Hall remarked that the programme was like "the Olympic Games with custard pies". The programme was revived under BBC Manchester's ownership with viewing figures surging from 100,000 to 15 million.
The early 2000s were tough for BBC Manchester and the diminishing Granada Television as a result of the ITV takeover in 2004 affected the level of programme production. 3SixtyMedia Studios at Granada Studios and New Broadcasting House only had enough filming work to operate two studios, despite having five available. New programmes such as "Life on Mars", "Dragons' Den" and "Waterloo Road" were all commissioned soon after and Manchester is now Europe's 2nd largest creative industry in Europe. BBC Manchester has conceived programmes such as "Top of the Pops", "Songs of Praise", "Mastermind", "A Question of Sport", "It's a Knockout", "Robot Wars" and "Red Dwarf".
BBC Manchester Big Screen.
The BBC's first Big Screen was erected in Manchester. The Screen became a permanent feature of Exchange Square in 2003 after a successful trial in Manchester during key events such as the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the 2002 Football World Cup.
Studios.
New Broadcasting House.
BBC Manchester have transferred to MediaCityUK, but its main base was previously New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in Manchester city centre, since 1975.
New Broadcasting House had one small studio and one large studio, Studio A which was equipped for live programming and recording drama programmes. Studio A underwent a major £6 million expansion in 1989 which increased the studios volume by 80%. Upon completion it was the largest BBC studio outside London at 6204 ft. 
In 2003, as BBC Pacific Quay, The Mailbox and BBC White City were being redeveloped it was touted the New Broadcasting House site could be redeveloped but this idea was eventually shelved to create a new purpose-built television studios.
New Broadcasting House was demolished in 2013, and the land is currently being used as a car park.
Granada Studios.
The BBC owns 20% of Granada Studios (officially "3SixtyMedia Studios" or "The Manchester Studios") through 3SixtyMedia. 3SixtyMedia is a joint venture, formed in 2000, between the BBC and ITV Studios. The venture aimed to cut costs for the BBC and Granada. The merger also gave the BBC greater use of the Granada Studios which are far larger than New Broadcasting House with three large studios and a number of drama studios compared with NBH which only has two multi-use studios.
The Studios, MediaCityUK.
BBC Manchester is transferring to MediaCityUK which is located two miles away from its previous base at New Broadcasting House in Salford Quays.

Filippo Acciaiuoli

Filippo Acciaiuoli (1637 – 8 February 1700) was an Italian composer, librettist, theater manager, machine designer, and poet. Acciaiuoli spent much of his youth and early adulthood traveling throughout Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa. After returning to Rome in his early twenties, he initially studied mathematics at a seminary in Rome but ultimately became interested in theater. He is best known for his work as a librettist for operas such as Jacopo Melani's "Girello", which premiered in Rome in 1668, and as the inventor of numerous sophisticated machines that were used in theatrical productions of the day. He also composed one opera, "Chi è cagion del suo mal pianga se stesso", which premiered in Rome in 1682. 
Acciaiuoli was the first business manager of the Teatro Tordinona in Rome and later the manager of the Teatro Capranica. He was also a member of "l’Academia degli Immobili" when Ferdinando Tacca developed its Teatro della Pergola. He had a close association with the court of Médicis. In 1689, Ferdinando II hired him to create theatrical machinery for the opera "Greco in Troia". Contracts for other theatrical productions followed. 
Acciaiuoli would also occasionally perform in operas as a dancer. He was a dancer in the interludes of the original 1658 production of Francesco Cavalli's "Hipermestra", among other productions. He also exerted his talents within puppet theatres, designing machinery and occasionally working as a manipulator of marionettes. It is speculated that he coordinated the various aspects of the production of "L’Empio Punito".

The Beauvilles

The Beauvilles are an American indie rock band currently based in Ybor City, Florida. Their music includes overtones of Americana, British Invasion, and Vintage R&B along with more experimental musical elements and time signatures. Current members include principal songwriter Shawn Kyle Beauville (vocals, guitar), Max Norton (drums, percussion), and Jason Dudney (electric bass, piano, organ, vocals)
Biography.
The Beauvilles recording debut came with the Singapore EP, which was produced at the personal studio of John Wesley (guitarist), best known for his work with London based Grammy winning artist, Porcupine Tree. 
The Singapore EP was considered a success for the group, garnering media attention, positive reviews and recognition by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences or NARAS,as a runner up in the independent GRAMMY awards held in Miami Florida. This recording opened doors for the group to perform at various music festivals such as SXSW in Austin, Texas where the Beauvilles were candidly photographed for Rolling Stone and interviewed by Erik Olsen, then of the New York Times. 
Reviews of the groups live shows identify them as a memorable live act, due to impassioned performances, and the unpredictability of their vocalist, which has resulted in the on stage destruction of their instruments, bursts of improvisation, and other arguable forms of performance art. Vocalist-guitarist Shawn Kyle has attributed this to his background as being raised in a Southern Pentecostal Church, a sect of Christianity where members open themselves up to become possessed by spirits, speak in tongues, and become enraptured. He has also stated that music is his current religion. 
In November 2008 the band inked a deal with the record label 24 Hour Service Station, home to various underground and fringe artists, for distribution of their upcoming full length record in the United States via IDN and AEC. 
The Beauvilles' first full length studio record entitled "Whispering Sin", was based on many non-fiction personal events that occurred during the group's previous three years of touring and principal songwriter Shawn Kyle's travels of "...countless cities of America and the countries of France and Japan." The Album art features an iconic 1940's photographic print of a woman floating in a lake taken by Toni Frissell. Kyle has said that this image has multiple relations to the record, given the tragic drowning suicide of a close friend, metaphors for baptismal religious ceremonies, the photographs' origination from a photo shoot in Florida, and the inspirations of film noir and soundtrack scores on the disposition of the recording. 
In early 2009 the group was chosen as an "official" showcasing artist for the internationally renowned music and film festival SXSW which takes place each year in Austin, Texas. The band headlined during the climax of the festival Saturday March 21 at 1am (technically Sunday morning) at the 6th street Wave Rooftop Venue to such an over capacity crowd that the fire marshall was called to block the doors, even refusing industry badge holders admission. The group was subsequently invited back as an official showcasing artist for SXSW 2010, and was reported to have performed "7 shows in 3 days". The Beauvilles have been an official headliner at the CMJ music festival in New York City. And have been invited back again for 2010 as an official artist for CMJ. 
In 2009 and 2010 the group performed the Harvest of Hope Festival put on by No Idea Records sharing bills with The National, Against Me!, Broken Social Scene, Billy Bragg, and Girl Talk among others. The group has also headlined at the annual NPR station WMNF 88.5 FM Heatwave Music Festival and has also been a regular invitee to the annual FMF music industry festival in Orlando, FL. 
According to the band New Order's web page the Beauvilles are slated to release a single cover of the song "Paradise" by New Order, to be included on the upcoming 'CEREMONY' compilation; Proceeds from the record sales will go to the charitable Salford Foundation Trust’s Tony Wilson Award, in honor of the late founder of Factory Records. The release date according to the 24 Hour Service Station web page is stated to be February 20, 2010. 
On September 4, 2010, the band recorded and filmed two live unreleased tracks, "Hooker" and "Turn Out The Lights," at North Avenue Studios in Orange City, Florida, for the studio's Off The Avenue sessions.
The band has stated that there will be a 2010 re-release of their first EP, Singapore as well as a record of new material, available on vinyl.
Band name.
While the band in its current scope was founded in 2002, vocalist and songwriter Shawn Kyle has used the name the Beauvilles for personal musical projects since 1996, and is often assumed to be the groups namesake due to occasionally using Beauville as a surname.
In various conflicting interviews over time he and other founding member Craig Holmes have claimed to have come up with the name from a variety of vague sources; cities in Europe, 1950's automobile models, Beauville being his last name because of adoption or losing a card game, a military base that he and other members of the band grew up on in Texas, a French gambling house, a group of southern spiritualists, or the desire to give listeners the idea they had discovered a recording of an obscure band from the 1960s like the The Beau Brummels.

<doc id="18958648" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18958648" title="Obesity in the United States">
Obesity in the United States

Obesity in the United States has been increasingly cited as a major health issue in recent decades. While many industrialized countries have experienced similar increases, obesity rates in the United States are among the highest in the world. 
The United States had the highest rate of obesity for large countries, until obesity rates in Mexico surpassed that of the United States in 2013. From 13% obesity in 1962, estimates have steadily increased. The following statistics comprise adults age 20 and over living at or near the poverty level. The obesity percentages for the overall US population are higher. reaching 19.4% in 1997, 24.5% in 2004, 26.6% in 2007, and 33.8% (adults) and 17% (children) in 2008. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported higher numbers once more, counting 35.7% of American adults as obese, and 17% of American children.
According to a study in "The Journal of the American Medical Association" ("JAMA"), in 2008, the obesity rate among adult Americans was estimated at 32.2% for men and 35.5% for women; these rates were roughly confirmed by the CDC again for 2009–2010. Using different criteria, a Gallup survey found the rate was 26.1% for U.S. adults in 2011, up from 25.5% in 2008. Though the rate for women has held steady over the previous decade, the obesity rate for men continued to increase between 1999 and 2008, the JAMA study notes. Moreover, "The prevalence of obesity for adults aged 20 to 74 years increased by 7.9 percentage points for men and by 8.9 percentage points for women between 1976–1980 and 1988–1994, and subsequently by 7.1 percentage points for men and by 8.1 percentage points for women between 1988–1994 and 1999–2000."
Obesity has been cited as a contributing factor to approximately 100,000–400,000 deaths in the United States per year and has increased health care use and expenditures, costing society an estimated $117 billion in direct (preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services related to weight) and indirect (absenteeism, loss of future earnings due to premature death) costs. This exceeds health-care costs associated with smoking or problem drinking and accounts for 6% to 12% of national health care expenditures in the United States.
Prevalence.
Obesity rates have increased for all population groups in the United States over the last several decades. Between 1986 and 2000, the prevalence of severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) quadrupled from one in two hundred Americans to one in fifty. Extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2) in adults increased by a factor of five, from one in two thousand to one in four hundred.
There have been similar increases seen in children and adolescents, with the prevalence of overweight in pediatric age groups nearly tripling over the same period. Approximately nine million children over six years of age are considered obese. Several recent studies have shown that the rise in obesity in the US is slowing, possibly explained by saturation of health-oriented media or a biological limit on obesity.
Race.
Obesity is distributed unevenly across racial groups in the United States.
Caucasian.
The obesity rate for Caucasian adults (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was 26.8%. For adult Caucasian men, the rate of obesity was 27.5% in 2010. For adult Caucasian women, the rate of obesity was 24.5% in 2010.
Black or African American.
The obesity rate for Black adults (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was 36.9%. For adult Black men, the rate of obesity was 31.6% in 2010. For adult Black women, the rate of obesity was 41.2% in 2010.
American Indian or Alaska Native.
The obesity rate for American Indian or Alaska Native adults (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was 39.6%. No gender breakdown was given for American Indian or Alaska Native adults in the CDC figures.
Asian.
The obesity rate for Asian adults (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was 11.6%. No gender breakdown was given for Asian adults in the CDC figures.
Hispanic or Latino.
The obesity rate for the Hispanic or Latino adults category (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was 31.9%. For the overall Hispanic or Latino men category, the rate of obesity was 30.7% in 2010. For the overall Hispanic or Latino women category, the rate of obesity was 33.1% in 2010.
Mexican or Mexican Americans.
Within the Hispanic or Latino category, obesity statistics for Mexican or Mexican Americans were provided, with no gender breakdown. The obesity rate for Mexican or Mexican Americans adults (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was 34.1%.
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.
The obesity rate for Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander adults (over 30 BMI) in the US in 2010 was 43.5%. No gender breakdown was given for Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander adults in the CDC figures.
Gender.
Over 66 million adults in U.S. are obese (30 million men and 36 million women). 74 million are overweight (42 million men and 32 million women).
Age group.
Historically, obesity primarily affected adults. This has changed in the last two decades. 15-25 percent of American children and adolescents are now obese. Children and adolescents who are obese are likely to be obese in adulthood and to develop obesity-related health problems.
Newborns.
Some newborns may be born big but this is more often a problem associated with a medical disorder. Unlike adults, newborns do not develop obesity. The number one cause of big babies is diabetes but this is not considered to be an obese baby.
Children and teens.
From 1980 to 2008, the prevalence of obesity in children aged 6 to 11 years tripled from 6.5% to 19.6%. The prevalence of obesity in teenagers more than tripled from 5% to 18.1% in the same time frame.
Data from NHANES surveys (1976–1980 and 2003–2006) show that the prevalence of obesity has increased: for children aged 2–5 years, prevalence increased from 5.0% to 12.4%; for those aged 6–11 years, prevalence increased from 6.5% to 19.6%; and for those aged 12–19 years, prevalence increased from 5.0% to 17.6%.
In 2000, approximately 19% of children (ages 6–11) and 17% of adolescents (ages 12–19) were overweight and an additional 15% of children and adolescents were at risk to becoming overweight, based on their BMI.
Analyses of the trends in high BMI for age showed no statistically significant trend over the four time periods (1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004, and 2005–2006) for either boys or girls. Overall, in 2003-2006, 11.3% of children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years were at or above the 97th percentile of the 2000 BMI-for-age growth charts, 16.3% were at or above the 95th percentile, and 31.9% were at or above the 85th percentile
Trend analyses indicate no significant trend between 1999–2000 and 2007-2008 except at the highest BMI cut point (BMI for age 97th percentile) among all 6- through 19-year-old boys. In 2007-2008, 9.5% of infants and toddlers were at or above the 95th percentile of the weight-for-recumbent-length growth charts. Among children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years, 11.9% were at or above the 97th percentile of the BMI-for-age growth charts; 16.9% were at or above the 95th percentile; and 31.7% were at or above the 85th percentile of BMI for age.
In summary, between 2003 and 2006, 11.3% of children and adolescents were obese and 16.3% were overweight. A slight increase was observed in 2007 and 2008 when the recorded data shows that 11.9% of the children between 6 and 19 years old were obese and 16.9% were overweight. The data recorded in the first survey was obtained by measuring 8,165 children over four years and the second was obtained by measuring 3,281 children.
"More than 80 percent of affected children become overweight adults, often with lifelong health problems." Children are not only highly at risk of diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure but obesity also takes a toll on the child's psychological development. Social problems can arise and ultimately having a snowball effect, causing low self-esteem which can later develop into eating disorders.
Elderly.
Although obesity is reported in the elderly, the numbers are still significantly lower than the levels seen in the young adult population. It is speculated that socioeconomic factors may play a role in this age group when it comes to developing obesity.
In the military.
An estimated sixteen percent of active duty U.S. military personnel were obese in 2004, with the cost of remedial bariatric surgery for the military reaching US$ 15 million in 2002. Obesity is currently the largest single cause for the discharge of uniformed personnel.
In 2005, 9 million adults of ages 17 to 24, or 27%, were too overweight to be considered for service in the military.
According to a 2012 research on young servicemen's autopsies revealed a large case of coronary disease problems occurring in large numbers to younger individuals who due to obesity had high cholesterol and blood pressure, which was prior to this commonly known in elderly folks.
Prevalence by state.
The following figures were averaged from 2005–2007 adult data compiled by the CDC BRFSS program and 2003–2004 child data from the National Survey of Children's Health.
Care should be taken in interpreting these numbers, because they are based on self-report surveys which asked individuals (or, in case of children and adolescents, their parents) to report their height and weight. Height is commonly overreported and weight underreported, sometimes resulting in significantly lower estimates. One study estimated the difference between actual and self-reported obesity as 7% among males and 13% among females as of 2002, with the tendency to increase.
The long-running REGARDS study, published in the journal of "Obesity" in 2013, brought in individuals from the nine census regions and measured their height and weight. The data collected disagreed with the data in the CDC's phone survey used to create the following chart. REGARDS found that the West North Central region (North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa), and East North Central region (Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana) were the worst in obesity numbers, not the East South Central region (Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky) as had been previously thought. Dr.P.H., professor in the Department of Biostatistics in the UAB School of Public Health George Howard explains that "Asking someone how much they weigh is probably the second worst question behind how much money they make," "From past research, we know that women tend to under-report their weight, and men tend to over-report their height." Howard said as far as equivalency between the self-reported and measured data sets, the East South Central region showed the least misreporting. "This suggests that people from the South come closer to telling the truth than people from other regions, perhaps because there’s not the social stigma of being obese in the South as there is in other regions."
Epidemiology.
Obesity is a chronic health problem. It is one of the biggest factors for a type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease. It is also associated with cancer (i.e. colorectal cancer), osteoarthritis, liver disease, sleep apnea, depression and other medical conditions that affect mortality and morbidity.
According to the NHANES data, African American and Mexican American adolescents between 12 and 19 years old are more likely to be overweight than non-Hispanic White adolescents. The prevalence is 21%, 23% and 14% respectively. Also, in a national survey of American Indian children 5–18 years old, 39 percent were found to be overweight or at risk for being overweight.
A 2007 study found that receiving Food Stamps long term (24 months) was associated with a 50% increased obesity rate among female adults.
Looking at the long-term consequences, overweight adolescents have a 70 percent chance of becoming overweight or obese adults, which increases to 80 percent if one or more parent is overweight or obese. In 2000, the total cost of obesity for children and adults in the United States was estimated to be US$ 117 billion (US$ 61 billion in direct medical costs).
Food consumption has increased with time. For example, annual per capita consumption of cheese was in 1909; in 2000; the average person consumed of carbohydrates daily in 1970; in 2000; of fats and oils in 1909; in 2000. In 1977, 18% of an average person's food was consumed outside the home; in 1996, this had risen to 32%.
Contributing factors to obesity epidemic.
According to Cleveland Clinic, cultural, social, and environmental factors, among others, all affect eating behaviors.
Diet.
Fast food has been cited as a contributing factor to obesity in the United States by various sources over the years. Around one third of children aged 4 to 19 eat fast food everyday in the U.S.
Many of America’s favorite foods, including hamburgers, french fries and doughnuts, are high in fat and carbohydrate content. These food items are also relatively inexpensive and available at fast food chains across the country (for ex. value menu). These convenience foods are frequently fried and are high in calories. Consumption of foods exceedingly high in fat calories can lead to obesity. Many menu items at fast food establishments do not fulfill basic nutritional requirements of a healthy meal. In a 2010 report by the Rudd Center for Food Policy it was noted that less than 1% of children's meals combinations met nutrition standards recommended by experts.
Fast food chains and restaurants have experienced improved sales with larger portion sizes. Research cited by the Center for Disease Control estimates restaurant meal sizes to be four times larger than they were in the 1950s.
Three studies published in the United States shows a correlation between sweet soda and fruit drinks to obesity. The consumption of sweet soda and fruit drinks has more than doubled since the 1970s. The first study showed that "drinking sugary drinks was affecting genes that regulate weight and increased the genetic predisposition of a person to gain weight." The other two studies showed that "giving to children and adolescents calorie-free drinks like mineral water or soft drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners resulted in weight loss."
One of the other two studies was conducted by Boston Children's Hospital who examined two groups of adolescents. The group which was encouraged to consume water or light sodas for a year gained . The other group, which consumed sugary drinks, gained . The third study was conducted by Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, Netherlands. They studied 641 children ages four to eleven over 18 months. They were split into two groups. One group drank sweet and fruity drinks and the other group drank the same drink with sugarless sweeteners. The group that drank the drink that had sugarless sweeteners gained on average compared to on average by the other group.
Sedentary lifestyle.
A sedentary lifestyle is another possible contributing factor to obesity. A sedentary lifestyle is a type of lifestyle with no or irregular physical activity. Sedentary activities include sitting, reading, watching television, playing video games, and computer use for much of the day with little or no vigorous physical exercise. A sedentary lifestyle can contribute to many preventable causes of death. "Screen time" is the amount of time a person spends watching a screen such as a television, computer monitor, or mobile device. Excessive screen time is linked to negative health consequences. Much of the United States gets insufficient exercise. As Americans have become more sedentary in their lifestyles, obesity rates have risen. More than 60% of U.S. adults do not exercise as recommended, and approximately 25% of U.S adults are not active at all. Exercise prevents excess weight and helps maintain weight loss. Despite the well-known benefits of physical activity, many adults and many children lead a relatively sedentary lifestyle and are not active enough to achieve these health benefits. Being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and decreases unhealthy triglycerides.
Social changes.
People are generally social which carries over into their eating habits. As Sidney Mintz, professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins University said, "Interaction over food is the single most important feature of socializing." The business world typically transacts business deals over food. Along with other activities, such as when people get together to catch up, food is served. At parties, there is food everywhere, at sports gatherings, food concession stands are ubiquitous. Funerals become wakes where mourners eat as part of mourning.
Technology such as televisions, cellular devices, and video games add on to the epidemic by increasing time spent in the home versus the time that could be spent being outside or doing some kind of physical activity. Not only have studies proven that children who watch more TV tend to have higher body fat percentage but that what they actually view can affect their eating habits. The approximate $10 billion spent annually for commercials to advertise food instills brand recognition and loyalty with children.
But in 2011, researchers assessed the causal relationship between recent increases in female labor force participation and the increased prevalence of obesity among women and found no such causal link. However, as families have become increasingly busy, quality family time has decreased. Research has shown that families who frequently spend significant time eating dinner as a family tend to have lower rates of obesity among children.
Total costs to the US.
There has been an increase in obesity-related medical problems, including type II diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and disability. In particular, diabetes has become the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimating in 2008 that fifty-seven million adults aged twenty and older were pre-diabetic, 23.6 million diabetic, with 90–95% of the latter being type 2-diabetic. 
Obesity has also been shown to increase the prevalence of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Babies born to obese women are almost three times as likely to die within one month of birth and almost twice as likely to be stillborn than babies born to women of normal weight.
Obesity has been cited as a contributing factor to approximately 100,000–400,000 deaths in the United States per year (including increased morbidity in car accidents) and has increased health care use and expenditures, costing society an estimated $117 billion in direct (preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services related to weight) and indirect (absenteeism, loss of future earnings due to premature death) costs. This exceeds health-care costs associated with smoking or problem drinking and accounts for 6% to 12% of national health care expenditures in the United States.
The Medicare and Medicaid programs bear about half of this cost. Annual hospital costs for treating obesity-related diseases in children rose threefold, from US$ 35 million to US$ 127 million, in the period from 1979 to 1999, and the inpatient and ambulatory healthcare costs increased drastically by US$ 395 per person per year.
These trends in healthcare costs associated with pediatric obesity and its comorbidities are staggering, urging the Surgeon General to predict that preventable morbidity and mortality associated with obesity may surpass those associated with cigarette smoking. Furthermore, the probability of childhood obesity persisting into adulthood is estimated to increase from approximately twenty percent at four years of age to approximately eighty percent by adolescence, and it is likely that these obesity comorbidities will persist into adulthood.
Anti-obesity efforts.
By 2013, there is evidence that some Americans have addressed the concern about obesity. This was done voluntarily, through dieting, and through legal means, by bans on junk food in schools.
There was a decrease in obesity rates. However, there was a significant increase in Americans who have slipped into the "extremely obese" category. The extremely obese category includes individuals who are roughly over a healthy weight.
Under pressure from parents and anti-obesity advocates, many school districts moved to ban sodas, junk foods, and candy from vending machines and cafeterias. State legislators in California, for example, passed laws banning the sale of machine-dispensed snacks and drinks in elementary schools in 2003, despite objections by the California-Nevada Soft Drink Association. The state followed more recently with legislation to prohibit their soda sales in high schools starting July 1, 2009, with the shortfall in school revenue to be compensated by an increase in funding for school lunch programs. A similar law passed by the Connecticut General Assembly in June 2005 was vetoed by governor Jodi Rell, who stated the legislation "undermines the control and responsibility of parents with school-aged children."
In mid-2006, the American Beverage Association (including Cadbury Schweppes, Coca Cola, and PepsiCo) agreed to a voluntary ban on the sale of all high-calorie drinks and all beverages in containers larger than 8, 10 and 12 ounces in elementary, middle and high schools, respectively.
Non-profit organizations such as HealthCorps work to educate people on healthy eating and advocate for healthy food choices in an effort to combat obesity.
The American First Lady Michelle Obama is leading an initiative to combat childhood obesity entitled "Let's Move". Mrs. Obama says she aims to wipe out obesity "in a generation". Let's Move! has partnered with other programs. Walking and bicycling to school helps children increase their physical activity.
In 2008, the state of Pennsylvania enacted a law, the "School Nutrition Policy Initiative," aimed at the elementary level. These “interventions included removing all sodas, sweetened drinks, and unhealthy snack foods from selected schools, 'social marketing' to encourage the consumption of nutritious foods and outreach to parents.” The results were a “50 percent drop in incidence of obesity and overweight”, as opposed to those individuals who were not part of the study.
For two years, Duke University psychology and global health professor Gary Bennett and eight colleagues followed 365 obese patients who had already developed hypertension. They found that regular medical feedback, self-monitoring, and a set of personalized goals can help obese patients in a primary care setting lose weight and keep it off.
Major United States manufacturers of processed food, aware of the possible contribution of their products to the obesity epidemic, met together and discussed the problem as early as April 8, 1999; however, a proactive strategy was considered and rejected. As a general rule, optimizing the amount of salt, sugar and fat in a product will improve its palatability, and profitability. Reducing salt, sugar and fat, for the purpose of public health, had the potential to decrease palatability and profitability.
Food labeling.
Ultimately, federal and local governments in the U.S. are willing to create political solutions that will reduce obesity ratings by “recommending nutrition education, encouraging exercise, and asking the food and beverage industry to promote healthy practices voluntarily.” In 2008 New York City was the first city to pass a “labeling bill” that “require restaurants” in several cities and states to “post the caloric content of all regular menu items, in a prominent place and using the same font and format as the price.”
Accommodations.
Along with Obesity came the accommodations made of American products. Child-safety seats in 2006 became modified for the 250,000 obese U.S. children ages six and below.
The obese incur extra costs for themselves and airlines when flying. Weight is a major component to the formula that goes into the planes take off and for it to successfully fly to the desired destination. Due to the weight limits taken in consideration for flight in 2000 Airlines spent $275 million on 350 million additional gallons of fuel for compensation of additional weight to travel.

Guillaume Desautels

Guillaume Desautels (desAutels, desAutelz) was a French poet of the sixteenth century associated with La Pleiade.
He was born in 1529 in Burgundy. The exact place of birth is not formelly known. Some sources gives Montcenis, Charolles, Vernoble in a château (now disappeared) of his father near Genouilly and Le Puley in "Les Hôtels" House, the second château of his family. He was the son of Syacre Desautels and Anne de la Vesure (de la Visine). He died about 1599 in Lyon. Various sources give the years 1570, 1576, 1579 and 1581 as well as "after 1584". One source says he lived to be 70 years of age; his last published work was in 1597.
Family.
He was married in 1548 to Jeanne de Bruyere. Other researchers give the name of Jane de Salle. It is not known if there were any children from this marriage or if, in fact, there were two distinct marriages. 
His maternal grandmother, also named Anne, was the sister of Etienne de Tyard, father of Pontus de Tyard, one of the seven members of the group of French poets called the Pléiade. Guillaume's mother, Anne de la Vesure would thus have been the first cousin of Etienne. 
The family was apparently prominent in Burgundy; they married into the Tyard family, who were not commoners. Also, another Anne de la Vesure (about three generations later) is recorded as the Abbess (Mother Superior) of an Ursuline convent in the then capital city of Burgundy, Dijon.
Pontus (1521–1605) Seigneur de Bissy (Biffy) became the Bishop of Chalon-sur-Saone in 1578 from where he was driven in 1590 and his chateau there plundered as a result of his support for Henry III of France against the Guise brothers who headed the Catholic League.
Early years.
As a youth, Guillaume studied under his governor, Jean Tullerius and at the college of Burgundy where he studied the humanities and philosophy until 1542. At the age of 15 he went to Lyon from 1544 to 1546 where he studied with Fontaine and Ancais at the school of Marat. He studied law at the university of Valence in Dauphiné from 1546 until 1549 under Coras. He never practiced the legal profession although he would have had need for it as Judge Magistrate at Cluny in later years. While in Valence he made the acquaintance of Cardinal Berthelemy Des Places, Melin de St. Gelais and his own cousin, the aforementioned Pontus de Tyard (although he probably already had met him in Burgundy) among others. It was during this period he was married to Jeanne de Bruyere whom he left at Montcenis to stay with his father. Guillaume did not leave her as it would seem a new bride in a strange house. The town of Bruyere is about 5 miles west of Vichy and only about 50 miles from Montcenis. It is more than likely that she had many friends and family in the area while Guillaume was away studying.
Apparently lonely in Valence and only 20 years of age, he met a woman named Denise L'hoste and her husband Jean Chabert of the nearby town of Romans, also in Dauphine. He took up residence with them in October 1549 and lived there for seven months during which time he and Denise developed a platonic love affair. She referred to him as "Sainte". It would have been during this period that he probably met Michel de Nostredame, forever known to the world as Nostradamus. In 1547 Nostradamus lived at Salon-de-Provence which is less than a hundred miles from Guillaumes' school at Valence. Nostradamus was quite familiar with Guillaumes' friend and fellow poet, Ronsard and was extremely well known and celebrated in Lyon for his successful efforts to combat the plague in that same year.
Guillaume then returned to Montcenis (which he referred to sarcastically as an "arid desert") in 1550 where he joined his wife and stayed until 1553. It was during this time that his father died and apparently left him little but his good name. The chateau and lands he inherited at Montcenis were "rather noble than rich". It cannot be left unsaid that it was surely in fief to the Barony of Montcenis since, in 1510 a man named Loys d'Orleans (whose titles included Prince, Viscount, Marquis and Baron) also carried the title of "Seigneur de la Baronnaie de Montcenis". The poverty of the estate was probably due to the loss of these lands by the now defunct Dukedom of Burgundy to the King of France in 1477, only about 75 years before Syacre's death. While maintaining the name now considered a family name of DesAutels it would seem that the loss of political and military value and connection to Burgundian Charolles and Montcenis had deprived the estate of its source of wealth and prestige.
He moved to Paris in 1553 hoping to secure an appointment with the King. While there he befriended Cardinal de Guise who was probably the source (directly or indirectly) of his well-being during these six years in Paris which he left in April, 1559. He went to Spain in the hope of gaining the favor of the Burgundian-Habsburg rulers there. For whatever reason he immediately sailed for Belgium which was also ruled by the same Burgundian-Habsburg house.
Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and ruler of much of Europe until his abdication in 1555 was the grandson of Mary of Burgundy who was sole heir to that house when her father was killed in battle in 1477 and France absorbed the province of Burgundy into the French realm. She married a Habsburg (probably to save her remaining power if not her life), thus uniting forever the houses of Burgundy and Habsburg. When Charles V abdicated his son Philip II of Spain became King and it was to him at Brussels that Guillaume set his gaze. He was there a mere two months when he left Brussels for Antwerp (Anvers, fr.) but was there only a few weeks. He was named Cartographer to the King for this short time and was probably so short a time because Philiip II, unhappy at Brussels left permanently for residence in Spain. Guillaume was aided at Brussels by two "beau-freres" brothers-in-law named Diamantius. Since that is not his wife's maiden name, it would appear that he had siblings — at least sisters — unless these two men possibly were husbands to sisters of Guillaume's wife. It is most interesting to ponder why he would have these two close relatives in a locale more than two hundred miles from his native land in Charolles.
Return to Paris.
Guillaume returned to Paris shortly after July 1559 where he stayed until 1564. Sometime after that he was at Cluny Abbey where he was appointed Judge Magistrate and is credited with saving the city and the Abbey for the Church when it was under siege by the Huguenot armies. Guillaume proposed that each side send out three knights to do battle. The Catholic knights won the field and thus saved Cluny, which had been (until St. Peter's in Rome just recently built) the greatest church in Western Christendom from the hands of the Protestants — only to be destroyed 200 years later by the republican mobs of the French Revolution.
The appointment of Guillaume to his post at Cluny was undoubtedly with the backing of the Guise brothers to whom his cousin Pontus de Tyard also surely owed his appointment as bishop to Chalon-sur-Saône. With Guillaume, the Catholic forces prevailed at Cluny. With Pontus at Chalon, not only did the Huguenot forces fail but he ended up losing his chateau and bishopric. For Guillaume, it did not hurt that the Desautels name was not unknown in the royal palace at Paris. A Pierre Desautels who had been a military commander in Burgundy had been made Valet de chambre (squire or gentlemans' gentleman) to King Francis I (ruled 1515–1547) in 1531. Francis' son Henry II (ruled 1547–1559) would have known him as well (Henry was born in 1519).
Writer.
Guillaume wrote on occasion under the pseudonyms of Glaumalis du Vezelet, G. Tesbault and Terhault. He also used a Latin form of his name ("Altario") and a geographical form: "Terhault" translates to "high ground" or perhaps even tableland. He published works mostly in Lyon but also in Paris, Antwerp and Rouen.
While not a member of the Pléiade, he was known as a major influence on the literary life of his time, if not as a major poet. Guillaume would have known most if not all of those poets, and supported for them in their use of the French language in their poetry. While he too wrote in vernacular French (rather than Latin), he is known for championing the use of Old French in prose and poetry and was against replacing it with a more "manufactured" orthography. He was renowned for his mastery of Latin and Greek. He wrote in the manner of François Rabelais and Pierre de Ronsard — other members of what we call today "La Pléiade". Ronsard (as well as another poet, Charles Fontaine), was undoubtedly his friend and wrote fondly of Guillaume. It is from his work that a reference to Guillaume says that he is "from Vernoble" a reference since confirmed.

Polysexuality (book)

Polysexuality is the tenth issue of the journal Semiotext(e), designed to illustrate "the plural aspects of sexuality." Edited by Canadian psychoanalyst François Peraldi, it was first published in 1981. The work reproduces images of genocide, massacre, and political disaster. According to Sylvére Lotringer, the purpose of these images was not to communicate terror and despair, but rather to connect sexuality to all the other flows that permeate society and to represent the death drive. They were intended to communicate ecstasy or jouissance. "Polysexuality" was reprinted in 1995, in a new edition noting that Peraldi had died of AIDS in 1993.
It reprinted material by writers and philosophers such as Pierre Klossowski, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Félix Guattari, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard, William S. Burroughs, Paul Virilio, Georges Bataille, Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes, and Guy Hocquenghem, together with an introduction written by François Peraldi. It contains thirteen chapters: "Self Sex", "Soft Sex", "Alimentary Sex", "Sex of the Gaze", "Ambiguous Sex", "Animal Sex", "Child Sex", "Morbid Sex", "Violent Sex", "Discursive Sex", "Philosophical Sex", and "Critical Sex".
The anthology was attacked in the United States Congress for its alleged advocacy of bestiality.

Robbie Coltrane

Robbie Coltrane, (born Anthony Robert McMillan; 30 March 1950) is a Scottish actor, comedian and author. He is known for his roles as Rubeus Hagrid in the "Harry Potter" films, as Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky in the James Bond films "GoldenEye" and "The World Is Not Enough" and as Dr. Eddie "Fitz" Fitzgerald in the British TV series "Cracker" during the 1990s.
Early life and education.
Coltrane was born Anthony Robert McMillan in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the son of Jean McMillan Ross (née Howie), a teacher and pianist, and Ian Baxter McMillan, a general practitioner who also served as a forensic police surgeon. He has an older sister, Annie, and a younger sister, Jane. Coltrane is the great-grandson of Scottish businessman Thomas W. Howie.
He was educated at Glenalmond College, an independent school in Perthshire, from which he was nearly expelled after hanging the prefects' gowns from the school clocktower. Though he later described his experiences there as deeply unhappy, he played for the rugby First XV, was head of the school's debating society and won prizes for his art. From Glenalmond, Coltrane went on to Glasgow School of Art, where he was ridiculed for "having an accent like Prince Charles" (which he quickly disposed of, though not before gaining the nickname "Lord Fauntleroy"), and thereafter the Moray House College of Education (part of the University of Edinburgh) in Edinburgh, Scotland.
Coltrane later called for public schools to be banned and used to be known as "Red Robbie", rebelling against his conservative upbringing through involvement with Amnesty International, Greenpeace, the Labour Party, and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
Career.
Coltrane moved into acting in his early twenties, taking the stage name Coltrane (in tribute to jazz saxophonist John Coltrane) and working in theatre and stand-up comedy. Appearing in the 1981 BBC television comedy series "A Kick Up the Eighties", his comic skills also brought him roles in the "The Comic Strip Presents" (1982) series and the comedy sketch shows "Alfresco" (1983–1984) and "Laugh??? I Nearly Paid My Licence Fee" (1984).
Coltrane soon moved into films, obtaining roles in movies such as "Flash Gordon" (1980), "Death Watch" (1980), "Scrubbers" (1983), "Krull" (1983), "The Supergrass" (1985), "Defence of the Realm" (1985), "Absolute Beginners" (1986), "Mona Lisa" (1986) and appeared as "Annabelle" in "The Fruit Machine" (1988). On television, he also appeared in "The Young Ones", "Tutti Frutti" (1987), as Samuel Johnson in "Blackadder" (1987) (a role he later reprised in the more serious "Boswell and Johnson's Tour of the Western Islands" (1993)), and in a number of stand-up and sketch comedy shows. He played the part of Falstaff in Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V" (1989) He co-starred with Eric Idle in "Nuns on the Run" (1990), and played the Pope in "The Pope Must Die" (1991). He also played a would-be private detective obsessed with Humphrey Bogart in the TV play "The Bogie Man".
His roles went from strength to strength in the 1990s with the TV series "Cracker" (1993–1996, returning in 2006 for a one-off special), in which he starred as forensic psychologist Dr. Edward "Fitz" Fitzgerald. The role won him three BAFTA awards.
After that, he gained roles in bigger films, such as the James Bond films "GoldenEye" (1995) and "The World Is Not Enough" (1999), a major supporting role in "From Hell" (2001), as well as half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the "Harry Potter" films (2001–2011). J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, had Coltrane at the top of her list to play Hagrid and, when asked who she would like to see in the role, responded “Robbie Coltrane for Hagrid” in one quick breath.
Coltrane has also presented a number of popular documentary programmes for the British ITV network based around his twin passions for travel and transportation. "Coltrane in a Cadillac" (1993) saw him cross North America from Los Angeles to 
New York behind the wheel of a 1951 Cadillac Series 62 coupe convertible, a journey of which he completed in 32 days.
In 1997, Coltrane appeared in a series of six programmes under the title "Coltrane's Planes and Automobiles," in which he extolled the virtues of a number of engineering achievements, namely the steam engine, the diesel engine, the supercharger, the V8 engine, the two-stroke engine, and the jet engine. In these programmes, he dismantled and rebuilt several engines. He also single-handedly removed the engine from a Trabant car in 23 minutes.
In August 2007, Coltrane presented a series for ITV called "B-Road Britain," in which he travelled from London to Glasgow, stopping in towns and villages along the way.
Coltrane was voted No. 11 in ITV's TV's 50 Greatest Stars and sixth in a poll of 2000 adults across the UK to find the 'most famous Scot', behind the Loch Ness Monster, Robert Burns, Sean Connery, Robert the Bruce and William Wallace.
Personal life.
Coltrane married Rhona Gemmell on 11 December 1999. The couple have two children, Spencer and Alice.

List of hop varieties

This is a list of varieties of hop ("Humulus lupulus").
Hops originate from China from which they have been spread westwards and eastwards. As there are male and female plants, the flowers (cones) of the female plant are fertilized by the pollen of the male flowers with the result that the female flowers form seeds. These seeds are eaten by birds and hence spread over vast distances. Hops, specifically their female plants, have been grown as a commercial crop for the brewing industry for many centuries in many countries. The first documented mention of a hop garden is in the will of Pepyn III, the father of Charlemagne. The first breeding of different hop varieties took place at Wye College in Kent, England by Prof. E.F. Salmon in 1919 when he bred the varieties "Brewers Gold" and "Bullion". There are around 80 varieties in commercial use around the world today (2012), and considerably more in development/trials.

When used in modest amounts, it is reminiscent of noble European varieties, contributing floral notes. Larger quantities are more fruity, with a hint of anise. Alpha acids 13 - 16%. Typical total oils (ml per 100g) 2.4 - 3.4. Breeding code 01-220-060.
Galaxy.
Australian high alpha dual purpose triploid cultivar with a marked and unique hop aroma, described as a combination of citrus and passionfruit. The initial aromas and flavors are quite intense, but these moderate as the beer matures. Bred in 1994 by Hop Products Australia by crossing a female tetraploid (J78) with a male derived from Perle. Alpha acids 11 - 16%. Typical total oils (ml per 100g) 3.0 - 5.0, which is the highest known. Breeding code 94-203-008.
Pride of Ringwood.
Used by Australian brewer Carlton and United Breweries to bitter all of its beers. The hop was created in 1953 at CUB's research facility in the Melbourne suburb of Ringwood, using open pollination of Pride of Kent females. Little historical information has been released by CUB on their web site. It is unique in being the only hop developed by one brewery, and used predominantly by that brewery. CUB's flagship beer VB changed from a red ale to a lager in the mid 1950s, and PoR is likely to have been the hop used for production. The hop has a strong aroma, and an earthy-citrus flavor, for late boil additions. Initial additions yield a clean bitterness. Green hopping is reported to produce good results. The hop does not have a long shelf life. However, the variety is highly resistant to diseases, and it has little inter-annual variation. Commercial harvests are now mostly Super Pride. Substitutes: Pacific Gem, Cluster, Northern Brewer.

Iguana

Iguana () is a genus of herbivorous lizards native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, several islands in Polynesia such as Fiji and Tonga, and the Caribbean. The genus was first described in 1768 by Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in his book "Specimen Medicum, Exhibens Synopsin Reptilium Emendatam cum Experimentis circa Venena". Two species are included in the genus "Iguana": the green iguana, which is widespread throughout its range and a popular pet, and the Lesser Antillean iguana, which is native to the Lesser Antilles and endangered due to habitat destruction. 
The word "iguana" is derived from the original Taino name for the species, "iwana".
In addition to the two species in the genus "Iguana", several other related genera in the same family have common names of the species including the word "iguana".
Anatomy and physiology.
Iguana can range from including their tail. The two species of lizard within the genus "Iguana" possess a dewlap, a row of spines running down their backs to their tails, and a third "eye" on their heads. This eye is known as the parietal eye, visible as a pale scale on the top of the head. Behind their necks are small scales which resemble spokes, known as tuberculate scales. These scales may be a variety of colors and are not always visible from close distances. They have a large round scale on their cheeks known as a subtympanic shield. 
Iguanas have great vision and can see shapes, shadows, colors, and movement at long distances. Iguanas use their eyes to navigate through crowded forests, as well as for finding food. They use visual signals to communicate with other members of the same species.
The tympanum, the iguana's ear drum, is located above the subtympanic shield and behind the eye. Iguanas are often hard to spot, as they tend to blend into their surroundings. Their scale colors are a mode of hiding from larger predators.
Male iguanas, as well as other male members of the order Squamata, have three hemipenes.

John McCaffary

John McCaffary (1820 – August 21, 1851) was the only defendant to be executed by the State of Wisconsin. He was executed by hanging for the murder of his wife.
On 23 July 1850, Bridgett McCaffary (née McKean) was drowned in a backyard cistern in Kenosha, a newly incorporated town in Kenosha County, Wisconsin. John McCaffary, an immigrant farmer from Ireland, was arrested and charged with the first degree murder of his wife. His trial began on May 6, 1851, and on May 23, 1851 the jury convicted him of willful murder. The judge sentenced him to death by hanging.
McCaffary was hanged from a tree on August 21, 1851 before a crowd of 2000 to 3000 people in front of then Kenosha courthouse and jail. The hanging was initially unsuccessful, and McCaffary remained alive and struggled on the end of the rope for approximately 20 minutes as he was slowly strangled. McCaffary was buried in the Green Ridge Cemetery in Kenosha. He was the first person executed by Wisconsin after it became a state of the United States in 1848. 
The spectacle of McCaffary's slow death in front of thousands led reformers in Wisconsin to press for abolition of the death penalty. On July 12, 1853, Wisconsin Governor Leonard J. Farwell signed a law that abolished the death penalty in Wisconsin and replaced it with a penalty of life imprisonment. The law is still in effect and no one has been executed by Wisconsin since McCaffary's death.

James Butler (grocer)

James Butler (1855–1934) was an American businessman from New York and prominent owner of racehorses and racetracks.
As a hotel steward in the early 1880s, Butler invested his $2,000 life savings with Patrick J. O'Connor (the son of his landlady) to open a grocery store on Second Avenue in New York. The business grew to a chain of stores so successful that Butler quit the hotel business and bought out O'Connor. Butler had a reputed net worth of $30 million by 1929.
By 1890, Butler had bought his first horses, and eventually acquired the EastView Stock Farm near Greenburgh and Mount Pleasant, New York. In the early 1900s, he established the Empire City Race Track.
At the time of his death, his grocery store chain was the sixth largest in the U.S. by total sales, and his more than 1,100 stores were second only to A & P in the New York area.

Theodore Roosevelt International Highway

The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was a transcontinental North American highway through the United States and Canada that ran from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon. Its length was about .
Route description.
The highway left Maine through the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the Green Mountains of Vermont to cross Lake Champlain by ferry into New York. The highway went through Ontario from Niagara Falls to Windsor and from Detroit through Michigan's Upper Peninsula to Duluth, Minnesota, and then through North Dakota and Montana. The highway passed through northern Idaho and Yakima, Washington, to follow the Columbia River into Oregon. U.S. Route 2 (US 2) was numbered along similar routing through the United States in 1926, although neither Portland was included. The eastern end of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was designated US 302 in 1935, and is still known locally as the "Roosevelt Trail".
In Michigan, the highway had a northern loop route in the Upper Peninsula. Between St. Ignace and Wakefield, the northern route followed what is now M-123 and M-28 while the southern route followed the rough path of today's US 2.
History.
The highway was designated as a memorial following Theodore Roosevelt's death on January 6, 1919. Michigan completed its section of the highway in the middle of 1926. A portion of the highway over the continental divide through Marias Pass in northwestern Montana was not completed until 1930. Automobiles were carried over the pass in Great Northern Railway cars until the highway was finished. Dedication ceremonies for the full route were held in Montana four months after the completion of the highway. The name has fallen into disuse after the 1930s with the 1926 designation of the United States Numbered Highway System that replaced much of its routing with numbered highway designations.

Clarence Otis, Jr.

Clarence Otis, Jr. (born April 11, 1956 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, USA) is an American businessman and CEO of Darden Restaurants. Otis was named the 11th most powerful person in Central Florida by the Orlando Sentinel in 2010.
Early life.
Otis was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi on April 11, 1956 to Clarence Otis, a janitor and Calanthus Hall Otis, a homemaker. He moved with his family to Los Angeles where he grew up in Watts, at the height of the civil unrest of the 1960s.
Education.
He gained a scholarship into Williams College in Massachusetts, where he majored in Economics and Political Science. He graduated magna cum laude in 1977, receiving the school's Political Science writing prize and Phi Beta Kappa recognition in his senior year. Otis then moved on to Stanford University Law School in California, earning his Law degree in 1980.
Career.
He worked in the field of corporate law, specializing in the fields of securities law and mergers and acquisitions. He started out with the firm Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine and moved on to Gordon, Hurwitz, Butowsky, Weitzen, Shalov & Wein. From the start he ran with a high-flying crowd; one of his clients was famed financier Carl Icahn. But, he later on remarked, "I thought the finance side was more exciting than the law, so I moved to an investment banking firm"—Kidder, Peabody & Co. The barely 30-year-old Otis became a vice president at First Boston Corporation in 1987. In this job he got his first exposure to Florida's booming economy as he worked on real estate deals there. He became interested in public and government finance, serving as managing director of Giebert Municipal Capital in 1990 and 1991, and as a vice president and later managing director in Chemical Bank's securities arm between 1991 and 1995. He played a key part in turning around the bank's struggling public finance division, shepherding funding of $2.6 billion for tax-exempt pollution-control projects and participating a $208 million New York City bond issue that was named deal of the year by Institutional Investor magazine.
In 1995, Otis was recruited by Darden Restaurants in Orlando for the post of treasurer, overseeing finance activities for the 1,200-restaurant chain. He correctly assessed Darden as a company on the rise as its "casual dining" market niche—high-volume sit-down restaurants a step above fast food in terms of quality—was growing rapidly. His biggest motivator, however seemed once again to be the opportunity to acquire a new skill set. Otis came to the company in the final stages of its spin-off from food giant General Mills.
Indeed, while Otis supervised a staff of six, his decisions had company wide ramifications as Darden acquired new sites and financed new buildings all over the country; the chain owns its restaurants rather than franchising them to independent entrepreneurs. He ascended the corporate ladder at Darden, becoming senior vice president of finance in 1997 and chief financial officer in 1999. As the chain shuttered its struggling China Coast restaurants and opened new ventures such as the casual sports-bar barbecue Smokey Bones and the Caribbean-themed Bahama Breeze, Otis impressed his bosses at Darden with his ability to master and apply new skills.
As longtime Darden CEO Joe L. Lee, who opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Florida in 1967, approached retirement, Otis was widely regarded as a protégé of Lee, and after one of his top rivals left for a top position with Burger King, his way was clear. Otis was named Lee's successor as CEO in 2004.
Compensation.
While CEO of Darden Restaurants in 2010, Otis earned a total compensation of $7,656,703, which included a base salary of $946,800, a cash bonus of $1,673,900, stocks granted of $1,783,697, options granted of $2,879,930, and other compensation totaling $372,376.
Politics.
According to Matthew Yglesias, Otis "seems to be a Democrat" and has donated to Democratic Congressman Ron Klein of Florida.
Personal life.
Otis and his wife Jacqueline Bradley (b. 1958) were married in 1983 and have raised three children. His son, Calvin (b. 1989), graduated from Columbia University in Spring 2011, where he was a member of the football team.

History of Santa Barbara, California

The history of Santa Barbara, California, begins approximately 13,000 years ago with the arrival of the first Native Americans. The Spanish came in the 18th century to occupy and Christianize the area, which became part of Mexico following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, the expanding United States acquired the town along with the rest of California as a result of defeating Mexico in the Mexican-American War. Santa Barbara transformed then from a dusty cluster of adobes into successively a rowdy, lawless Gold Rush era town; a Victorian-era health resort; a center of silent film production; an oil boom town; a town supporting a military base and hospital during World War II; and finally it became the economically diverse resort destination it remains in the present day. Twice destroyed by earthquakes, in 1812 and 1925, it most recently has rebuilt itself in a Spanish Colonial style.
Pre-contact history.
The lands flanking the Santa Barbara Channel, both the mainland including present day Santa Barbara, and the Channel Islands, has been continuously inhabited by the Chumash people and their ancestors for at least 13,000 years. The oldest human skeleton yet found in North America, Arlington Springs Man, was unearthed on Santa Rosa Island, approximately from downtown Santa Barbara. 
In more recent pre-Columbian times the Chumash had many villages along the shores and inland, at least one of which, on present-day Mescalitan Island, had over a thousand inhabitants in the 16th century. They were peaceful hunter-gatherers, living from the region's abundant natural resources, and navigating the ocean in tomols, craft closely related to those used by Polynesians. Their rock art work can be seen in nearby Chumash Painted Cave, and their sophisticated basket weaving at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. The Santa Barbara bands spoke the Barbareño language dialect of the Chumashan languages group. As Europeans settled in their homelands the Chumash population declined.
Spanish period.
The first Europeans to see the area were members of a Spanish expedition led by the Portuguese explorer João Cabrilho, who sailed through the Channel in 1542, and anchored briefly in the vicinity of Goleta. He injured himself on the trip, dying of his injury in January 1543, and was buried either on San Miguel Island or Mescalitan Island – the exact burial place of Cabrilho has long been a mystery. Sir Francis Drake also sailed past the area in 1579, but is not known to have made anchorage. In 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno gave the name "Santa Barbara" to the region, in gratitude for having survived a violent storm in the Channel on December 3, the eve of the feast day of Saint Barbara. However it was not until 1769 that Europeans established a colonizing land presence, with the arrival of Gaspar de Portolà and Franciscan missionary Junípero Serra in upper Las Californias. This expedition was sent by King Carlos III to occupy the region, convert the natives to Christianity, and fortify it against perceived threats of other encroaching European colonial powers – principally the early British Empire and tsarist Russian-Pacific Empire.
Portola's expedition reached Santa Barbara on August 14, 1769, encountering exceptionally friendly natives, many of whom lived in Syuxtun, a village just in back of the beach between present-day Chapala and Bath streets. Indeed the natives – which the Spaniards dubbed the Canaliños for the "canoes" (actually tomols) they used so skillfully – so irritated their guests with gifts and boisterous music that Portola changed the location of his camp so his soldiers and missionaries could get some rest. Portola, however, did not stay, and it was not until 1782 that a force of soldiers, led by Don Felipe de Neve and again accompanied by Junipero Serra, came to build the Presidio of Santa Barbara, one of several military outposts meant to protect the area against foreign interests. While the Presidio was not completed until 1792, Father Fermín Lasuén dedicated the new Mission Santa Barbara on the feast day of Santa Barbara (December 4, 1786). He chose for his building site the location of a Chumash village on Mission Creek named Tay-nay-án.
Many of the soldiers who came to build and garrison the Presidio had brought their families with them, and after their terms of service ended settled in Santa Barbara. They built their adobes near the Presidio, arranged haphazardly; a Boston journalist described the scatter of these buildings "as though fired from a blunderbuss." Most of Santa Barbara's old families are descended from these early settlers, and many of their names linger in the street and place names, such as Cota, De la Guerra, Gutierriez, Carrillo, and Ortega.
Building the Mission itself continued throughout the rest of the century, along with the work of converting the Indians to Christianity, a task which proved difficult: according to the Mission registers, by 1805, only 185 of the more than 500 Indians in Santa Barbara had been baptized. The burial register shows that 3,997 Indians died between 1787 and 1841, the majority from diseases such as smallpox, to which the natives had no natural immunity. By 1803 the Mission's chapel was finished, and by 1807 a complete village for the Indians had been completed, largely by their own labor. The site of this village is on the Mission grounds along modern-day Constance Street.
On December 21, 1812, one of the largest earthquakes in California history completely destroyed the first Mission along with most of Santa Barbara. With an estimated magnitude of 7.2, and a hypothesized epicenter near Santa Cruz Island, the quake also produced a tsunami which carried water all the way to modern-day Anapamu Street, and carried a ship a half-mile up Refugio Canyon. Following the devastating earthquake, the Mission padres decided to build a larger and more elaborate Mission complex, which is the one that survives to the present day. While the church was ready in 1820, the bell towers were not finished until 1833.
The most serious military threat to Santa Barbara during the Spanish period was not by a colonial power, but by Hippolyte de Bouchard, a French privateer working for the Argentine government, which was, along with Mexico, attempting to throw off Spanish rule. Bouchard, who was given the task of destroying as many Spanish assets as possible, and in particular the ports in the Americas, possessed two well-armed frigates, which had sufficient armament and crews to destroy any lightly defended towns they encountered. He had done exactly that to Monterey, the capital of Alta California, shortly before coming to Santa Barbara.
Bouchard's raiders landed first at Refugio Canyon, where they pillaged and burned the ranch belonging to the Ortega family, killing cattle and slitting the throats of horses. However, after being alerted by messengers from Monterey, the Presidio dispatched a squadron of cavalry, who caught three stragglers from the ill-disciplined raiding party and dragged them back to Santa Barbara in chains. Bouchard sailed the remaining twenty miles (32 km) to Santa Barbara a few days later, anchoring off of present-day Milpas Street, and threatened to shell the town unless his men were returned to him. José de la Guerra y Noriega, the "comandante" of the Presidio, granted his request, but Bouchard did not realize that he had been tricked: the town was not as heavily defended as it had seemed to be; the hundreds of cavalrymen Bouchard had seen through his spyglass were but the same few dozen riding in large circles, stopping and changing costumes each time they passed behind a patch of heavy brush. Although Bouchard had recently destroyed Monterey, he departed without attacking the town.
A more lasting effect of Bouchard's California raid was the arrival of Joseph John Chapman, an American sailor who had been a member of Bouchard's crew but was left behind (either at Monterey or at Refugio) to become the first US-born permanent resident of Spanish California. Many years later, Chapman (who had married an Ortega daughter) also became the first US-born permanent resident of Santa Barbara.
Mexican period.
In 1822 the Spanish rule ended and their flag came down forever, with their loss in the Mexican War of Independence. Santa Barbara, along with the rest of Alta California, became a territory of independent Mexico. One of the earliest notable events in the Mexican period in Santa Barbara was the February 1824 Indian rebellion. The Indians especially resented the poor and scapegoating treatment given them by the soldiers stationed at the Presidio, who were resentful of being unpaid by the new government. The rebellion, incited by the more warlike Yokut—Tulares, inland relations of the Chumash, began at Mission Santa Inés, near present-day Solvang on the other side of the Santa Ynez Mountains, and quickly spread to Mission La Purísima Concepción. In Santa Barbara, the Indians seized control of the buildings of the Mission complex, but immediately the buildings were surrounded by Presidio soldiers, since the Presidio was little more than a mile away. Overnight the Indians were able to make a getaway north into Mission Canyon and then over the mountains, where they eventually linked up with other unsubdued groups of Native Americans in the southern San Joaquin Valley. After a battle near San Emigdio Creek in March, and a subsequent three-month pursuit and negotiation, the Indians were recaptured near Buena Vista Lake, and brought back to Santa Barbara.
During the Mexican period, civilian government replaced military and mission control for the first time. An alcalde (roughly equivalent to a "strong" mayor) was appointed, supplemented by other civilian officials. The Mexican government opened Alta California to trade with the United States, Great Britain and other foreign countries, and exports became important to the local economy. Principal export commodities were tallow and hides, both of which were carried by California clippers to Boston to the candle- and shoe-making factories in New England, in return for goods purchased by the locals. One of the most famous English-language descriptions of Santa Barbara from this period is by Richard Henry Dana, Jr., who wrote of the town as a desolate place, at the ends of the earth, in "Two Years Before the Mast":
By 1833 the process of secularization at the Missions was completed, and the lands and property were given to soldiers, leading Californios, and occasionally the original Native American owners, with most of the Indians becoming Mexican citizens. This had a dramatic effect on the economy and culture, commencing what is called the Rancho Period in California history, a period which overlapped the end of the Mexican era. Lands formerly owned by the Church were parceled out in land grants to applicants; the Mexican governors of California awarded over 800 separate land grants before the end of Mexican control in 1847. Many local place names derive from these grants, including Dos Pueblos, San Marcos, Refugio (the only Spanish-era land grant in Santa Barbara County), Las Positas, and Goleta. 
Cattle ranching rapidly expanded, becoming the predominant land use; horsemanship and cattle ownership became the symbols of status, and the society developed quasi-feudal characteristics, in which the largest ranches were almost entirely self-sufficient. The Chumash who previously had served the padres in the Mission system became laborers on the ranches, occupying the lowest rung of the social ladder, with the oldest established families – the Ortegas, De la Guerras, and others – at the top. During this period the town of Santa Barbara grew into a modest, and informally organized collection of structures around the central Presidio. A few of these buildings – such as the Covarrubias adobe, on the grounds of the Santa Barbara Historical Society on Santa Barbara Street, which was briefly the location of the capitol of California during the Mexican War – survive to the present day. By the mid-1840s the Mexican period, the population of Santa Barbara had reached approximately 2,500.
Mexican–American War.
The end of the Mexican period came quickly for Santa Barbara, but without bloodshed. The United States conquest of California in the Mexican–American War had broken out in May 1846 over the annexation of Texas; in August, Commodore Robert F. Stockton anchored a warship in Santa Barbara harbor and deployed a contingent of ten Marines to occupy the town. They proceeded to the Presidio where they ran the Stars and Stripes over the city for the first time; not long afterwards, seeing the town was peaceful, they left, being replaced later by ten cavalrymen from John C. Frémont's army. However, a contingent of a hundred Mexican cavalrymen sent by General José María Flores came and chased them out. The outnumbered cavalrymen, rather than surrender, fled on foot up into Mission Canyon, and fortified a rocky ridge below La Cumbre Peak, resisting the calls to surrender by their pursuers. When the Mexican force set fire to the chaparral, the Americans clambered over the mountain ridge overnight, escaping north and eventually reaching Monterey, where they joined forces again with Frémont.
The culminating event of the Mexican–American War for Santa Barbara was Frémont's return, over the surprise route of San Marcos Pass, which at the time was little more than a trail. On the night of December 24, 1846, during a torrential rainstorm, he led his California Battalion over the mountains. In spite of losing many of his horses, mules, and cannon to the treacherous and muddy slopes – and not a one to enemy fire – he reached the foothills on the other side in the vicinity of present-day Tucker's Grove, spent the next several days regrouping, and then marched into Santa Barbara to capture the Presidio. He encountered no resistance: all men interested in fighting had left for Los Angeles to join the forces headed by Flores and Andrés Pico which had assembled to defend that city. On January 3 Frémont headed south, skirting the cliffs of the Rincon at low tide (no road existed then), arriving in Los Angeles ten days later. The Treaty of Cahuenga, signed on January 13, 1847, ended the war in California. After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed a year later, Santa Barbara formally became part of the United States.
U.S. annexation; Gold Rush; Haley; Civil War.
Change came quickly after the end of the war. Gold was found at Sutter's Mill in the Sierra foothills, and hordes of gold-seekers flooded into California from the eastern United States, and other places in the world, to become rich. Few did, but Santa Barbara began to attract settlers, as newcomers discovered the charms of the place, including that almost anything planted would grow there. In 1850 California became the 31st state, and immediately after its establishment both Santa Barbara City and County came into being. By 1850 the area was still sparsely populated, with the census showing only 1,185 people for the entire county, but that number doubled in ten years.
Some of the changes that occurred involved administration, communications, construction, urban layout, and transportation. On April 9, 1850, Santa Barbara incorporated as a city, and formed an official town council. The appearance of the town began to change as well. Settlers coming from the east wanted dwellings made from wood, rather than the sensible adobe built by the Spanish and Mexican residents; to build them they needed to import wood from distant Oregon, as the local oak trees were not suitable for lumber. This was one of several pressures that resulted in the development of the port.
Another consequence of the American takeover was the creation of the street grid, which replaced the previous haphazard jumble of dwellings and irregular paths. Its execution, the disastrously bungled survey of 1851 by Salisbury Haley, is a notorious event in local history. Haley's survey chains were broken in places, and held together with oxhide, a material that expanded on damp mornings and contracted in the afternoon sun; since his chains varied in length depending on the time of day he used them, most of his measurements were off, accumulating errors of as much as out of true by the time he had crossed the city. Haley had been ordered to create neat square city blocks exactly on a side: a subsequent corrective survey established that he had actually created blocks ranging from 457 to on a side. The lot misalignments and street grid problems caused by Haley persist to the present day. Kinks in Mission Street at De La Vina, and De La Guerra at Santa Barbara Street are two of the awkward places well-known to city commuters which were resulted from Haley's unfortunate measurements. In addition, it was Haley who decided to lay out the street grid at an angle of approximately 48 degrees from north, with State Street approximately midway between the Mesa and the Riviera, paralleling both hills, an orientation that confuses both residents and visitors. Downtown's Haley Street, named after him, is ironically one of the streets which did not need a dog-leg to compensate for his variable-length chain.
Another change that accompanied the transformation of Santa Barbara from a small village to a significant town was the founding of the first newspaper, the "Santa Barbara Gazette", in 1855. The newspaper was half in English and half in Spanish, since the population, not all of whom were bilingual, was split between the two languages. English gradually supplanted Spanish as the language of daily life. Although minutes of the newly formed City Council were kept in English by 1852, Spanish remained the language used for public records until 1870. 
The 1850s was a tumultuous and violent period. Life in the town was disrupted by rowdy Americans recently returned from the gold camps in the Sierra foothills, and gangs of toughs and highwaymen. Some of these lawless newcomers targeted the local Spanish population, causing violent racial incidents including lynchings. Outlaws such as Joaquin Murrieta (the Zorro of Hollywood legend, but likely a composite of several different bandits) preyed on travelers on the roadways, and even on citizens in town. The confrontation with the gang led by Jack Powers at the "Battle of Arroyo Burro" in 1853, in which he intimidated and drove away a posse of approximately 200 citizens, was one of the most dramatic incidents of the period. Powers was not thrown out of town until a band of angry and well-armed vigilantes from San Luis Obispo rode to Santa Barbara to get rid of him (he eventually came to a bloody end, murdered and hurled into a den of hungry wild boars in the Mexican state of Sonora). His downfall coincided with the return of law and order after a period in which Santa Barbara was the rowdiest and most dangerous town between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
In 1859, Richard Henry Dana returned, 24 years after his first visit as a 20-year-old sailor, and described the changes in the town:
In that same year, 1859, Santa Barbara recorded the highest temperature ever noted on the North American continent, , a record which was to stand until Death Valley topped it by one degree in 1913. The U.S. Coast Survey wrote that birds dropped dead in midair, cattle died in the fields, and fruit dropped, scorched, from trees; the town's inhabitants fled to the safety of their adobe buildings, which insulated them from the freak superheated northwest simoon wind, an event which has not occurred since. In the immediately following years, two other weather events had a significant effect on the course of development in Santa Barbara: catastrophic floods during the winter of 1861-62, during which the Goleta Slough, formerly open to deep-water vessels, completely silted up, becoming the marsh it remains to the present day; and the disastrous drought of 1863, which forever ended the Rancho era as the value of rangeland collapsed, cattle died or were sold off, and the large ranches were broken down and sold in smaller parcels for development.
Victorian period.
The town continued to grow, and slowly ended its isolation after the American Civil War. The war itself had little effect on Santa Barbara. One troop of cavalry organized to join the Union cause, but never saw action against Confederate forces; they served briefly and bloodlessly in Arizona versus Apache raids. In 1869, the first coeducational preparatory school in southern California, Santa Barbara College, opened at State and Anapamu Streets. Improvements in the harbor included the building of Stearns Wharf in 1872, which increased the commercial capacity of the port; formerly, ships had to anchor several miles offshore, and load and unload their cargoes by rowing small boats to the shore. In that same year, Jose Lobero built an opera house (at the current site of the Lobero Theatre), State Street was paved, and gas lamps were lit downtown.
Writer Charles Nordhoff, commissioned by Southern Pacific Railroad to write about Santa Barbara to draw easterners to the town, was largely responsible for the boom in the tourism industry that commenced in the 1870s, and which would eventually lead to Santa Barbara becoming a world-famous resort. He praised Santa Barbara as the "pleasantest" spot in California, and particularly delightful for those suffering health ills; his book resulted in steamships full of travelers, many of whom came to stay. The luxurious and instantly famous Arlington Hotel, built in 1874 (and destroyed by fire in 1909), housed many of them.
The isolation of Santa Barbara ended in stages. The building of Stearns Wharf allowed easy access by steamboat; in 1887, the railroad to Los Angeles was completed; and in 1901, the railroad was put through to San Francisco. Santa Barbara was finally accessible both by land and sea. The day that the first train arrived from San Francisco was also the last day that the stagecoach bumped over dusty San Marcos Pass. These new connections made possible Santa Barbara's development into the resort destination it has remained ever since. Within the city, the first electric streetcar line opened in 1896, as the demand for transportation increased. By 1900, the population had reached 6,587, doubling in twenty years.
The discovery of oil changed the local economy as well as the landscape. While the black gooey stuff had long been known from natural oil seeps, and was used as a roof sealant during the building of the Mission, its value as a fuel did not become widely known until the late 19th century. In the 1890s, the large Summerland Oil Field was found and began to be developed. Summerland was the site of the world's first offshore oil well. While most of the oil had been pumped out by 1910, derricks remained on the beach in Summerland into the 1920s, and the field remained partially productive until 1940.
Early 20th century to World War II.
Santa Barbara was the center of the U.S. silent film industry from 1910 to 1922, before anyone associated the name "Hollywood" with movies. The Flying A Studios, a division of the American Film Company, covered two city blocks centered at State and Mission streets, and was at the time the largest movie studio in the world. It produced approximately 1,200 films during those twelve years, including the world's first indoor set and likely the first animated cartoon. Only about 100 of those films are known to survive today. Many of the studio's films were westerns; Lon Chaney, Sr. and Victor Fleming were among the famous actors featured. In 1911, before the Flying A had become the predominant studio in the area, there were 13 separate film companies in Santa Barbara. The local film era ended in 1922 when the studios moved south, needing the resources of a larger city.
During this period, the city continued to grow, and at an even faster pace. By 1920, the population had reached 19,441, tripling in twenty years. The completion of the water tunnel under the mountains to newly completed Gibraltar Reservoir on the Santa Ynez River relieved the water shortages for a time. Also during the teens, a movement for city beautification commenced, led by Bernhard Hoffmann and later by Pearl Chase; their idea was to unify the city's architecture around a Spanish Colonial style, harmonious with the Mission and surviving pueblos. Many of the buildings from the late 19th century were, to their eyes and the eyes of many citizens, ugly, dilapidated, and no different from those in dozens of other run-down western towns. The Lobero Theatre, built on the site of the original Lobero Opera House in 1924, was an example of the architectural style they promoted, as was the first part of the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum.
1925 earthquake.
The most destructive earthquake in Santa Barbara history, and the first destructive earthquake in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, occurred on June 29, 1925, converting much of the town to heaps of rubble. While the quake's epicenter was centered on an undetermined fault offshore, most of the damage came about due to two strong aftershocks which occurred onshore and five minutes apart. The intensity on the Modified Mercalli scale was determined to be VIII for the coast from Goleta, through Santa Barbara, and to Carpinteria.
The low death toll (13 or 14) is credited to its early hour, 6:23 a.m., before most people were in the streets at risk from falling masonry. A fire which broke out after the earthquake destroyed more of the town, but was contained by a company of U.S. Marines who had arrived immediately to help maintain order. The earthquake, coinciding with the movement for architectural reform, is credited with giving the town its unified Spanish character; during the rebuilding, Hoffman and Chase pushed for new structures to be in a Spanish style. The most famous of these was the Spanish-Moorish style County Courthouse, completed in 1929, "the loveliest in the United States." One of the few voices opposing the unification of architectural style was newspaper publisher and future Senator Thomas Storke, who later changed his mind, saying that his former opposition was due to his belief that such compulsion infringed on the constitutional rights of property owners. Storke in 1932 created the city's main newspaper for the next 74 years, the "News-Press", by winning a libel suit against his rival Reginald Fernald, and absorbing that publisher's "Morning Press" into his "Daily News".
In 1928, oil was found at the Ellwood Oil Field on the other side of Santa Barbara, and development of this new and rich pool was fast: the peak production in 1930, only two years later, was of oil. As at the Summerland Oil Field, derricks went along piers into the ocean, and the cliffs were dotted with storage tanks. Some of this development remains to the present day, with one active wastewater disposal well and several large storage tanks, owned by Venoco, Inc., adjacent to the Ellwood Open Space. In 1929, as part of the wild burst of oil-drilling activity following on the Ellwood discovery, the Mesa Oil Field was discovered within the city limits. Centered just south of Cliff Drive near the intersection with Santa Cruz Boulevard, the field sprouted over 100 oil derricks in the early 1930s, occasioning the city's first anti-oil protest, but a local ordinance had already been enacted allowing such development. The field’s failure in the late 1930s—it proved to be smaller than initially thought—allowed residential development to continue on the Mesa, although the field was not formally abandoned until 1976.
World War II brought sweeping change to the Santa Barbara area. The U.S. Marines took up residence on the high ground adjacent to Goleta Point, current location of the University of California, Santa Barbara campus. The military filled in the Goleta Slough in order to expand the adjacent airport; the U.S. Navy took over the harbor area; and north of Point Conception the Army created Camp Cooke, which was later to become Vandenberg Air Force Base. On February 23, 1942, not long after the outbreak of war in the Pacific, a Japanese submarine emerged from the ocean and lobbed about 25 shells at the Ellwood Oil Field facilities, one of only two direct attacks on the U.S. mainland during the entire war, and the first such attack since the War of 1812. Although the gunners were terrible marksmen, and only caused about $500 damage to a catwalk, panic was immediate. Many Santa Barbara residents fled, and land values plummeted to historic lows. Only one week after the attack, on March 2, military authorities issued Public Proclamation No. 1, which began the long internment of Japanese during the war, and approximately 700 people of Japanese ancestry assembled on Cabrillo Boulevard to be taken to Manzanar.
After World War II.
After the war ended, many people who had seen Santa Barbara during the war came back to stay. The population grew by 10,000 by 1950, in just five years. During this time the University of California took over the blufftop Marine camp, turning it into a modern university. The burst of growth brought traffic, housing, and water problems, which led to improvements in the transportation system, such as the building of Highway 101 through town; tracts of low-cost housing, especially on the Mesa, where oil derricks were removed and replaced by houses; and the building of Lake Cachuma reservoir on the other side of the mountains, along with another water tunnel to bring its water to thirsty residents. During this period, the city selectively recruited businesses to relocate there, choosing clean industries such as aerospace and technology in preference to the oil industry which had already marred many local landscapes with abandoned wells and sumps.
The oil industry moved most of its local operations offshore during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1947, offshore leases were approved by the federal government, and seismic exploration of the Channel took place in the 1950s, even though fishermen complained that the underwater explosions were killing fish. The first of the huge black fifteen-story oil platforms, a feature of the seascape south of Santa Barbara for fifty years, went up in 1958. During the period, Stearns Wharf was the main connection for oil services going out to the platforms.
Making the relationship between Santa Barbara and the oil industry even worse was the disaster of January 28, 1969, one of the formative events in the modern environmental movement. A blowout on an offshore oil well at the Dos Cuadras Offshore Oil Field spewed between of oil, producing an immense oil slick which spread over hundreds of square miles of ocean in the Santa Barbara Channel, contaminating shorelines, killing wildlife, ruining the tourist industry, and appearing on television screens worldwide. The anti-oil group "GOO" (Get Oil Out) formed shortly after the spill, and oil drilling has been a sensitive issue in the area ever since. Wider consequences of the spill included the 1970 passage of both the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act, laws which require assessment of potential environmental impacts of projects before they begin.
Several catastrophic fires burned portions of Santa Barbara and the adjacent mountains in the late 20th century. In 1964, the Coyote Fire burned of backcountry along with 150 homes, blackening the mountain wall behind Santa Barbara, and briefly threatening the entire town of Montecito. In 1977, the smaller but more destructive Sycamore Fire roared down Sycamore Canyon on the northeast fringe of Santa Barbara, destroying over 200 homes. Most destructive of all was the 1990 Painted Cave Fire, which incinerated over 500 homes in just several hours during an intense Sundowner wind event, crossing over the freeway to Hope Ranch, and causing over a quarter billion dollars in damage.
The population center of Santa Barbara moved west during the period, with the buildout of the region west of the De La Vina/State intersection, including the San Roque neighborhood, Hope Ranch Annex, and later the Goleta Valley. As a result, the citrus groves which formerly stood in the region were cut down and replaced by housing and commercial districts. Regional shopping centers such as Loreto Plaza, Five Points, and La Cumbre Plaza developed during this period. Between 1960 and 1970, the population of the Goleta Valley rose from only 19,016 to 60,184. 
By the mid-1970s, forces opposing uncontrolled growth had become stronger than those favoring development. On April 8, 1975, the City Council passed a resolution to limit the city's population to 85,000 through zoning. In order to limit growth in adjacent areas, such as Goleta, it was standard to deny water meters to developments which had been approved by the County Board of Supervisors, effectively shutting off growth. The city and immediately adjacent areas stopped their fast growth, but housing prices rose sharply.
When voters approved connection to state water supplies in 1991, parts of the city, especially outlying areas, resumed growth, but more slowly than during the boom period of the 1950s and 1960s. While the slow growth preserved the quality of life for most residents and prevented the urban sprawl notorious in the Los Angeles basin, housing in the Santa Barbara area was in short supply, and prices soared: in 2006, only six percent of residents could afford a median-value house. As a result, many people who work in Santa Barbara commute from adjacent, more affordable areas, such as Santa Maria, Lompoc, and Ventura. The resultant traffic on incoming arteries, particularly the stretch of Highway 101 between Ventura and Santa Barbara, is another problem being addressed by long-range planners.

It consolidated on 25 September-1 November 1917 with the 2nd Battalion, Companies L and M, and the Sanitary Detachment, 2nd Infantry Regiment; the consolidated unit reorganized and was redesignated as the 160th Infantry and assigned to the 40th Division. It demobilized on 7 May 1919 at Camp Kearny in San Diego. 
Former southern California elements reorganized on 23 August-6 October 1921 in the California National Guard as the 160th Infantry and was assigned to the 40th Division; Headquarters was Federally recognized on 31 January 1922 at Los Angeles. 
The 2nd Battalion 160th Infantry, reorganized and was redesignated on 1 April 1929 as the 2nd Battalion, 185th Infantry, an element of the 40th Division (160th Infantry - hereafter separate lineage). It expanded, reorganized, and was redesignated in March–April 1930 as the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 185th Infantry, elements of the 40th Division (later designated as the 40th Infantry Division). It was inducted into Federal service on 3 March 1941 at home stations. It inactivated on 7 April 1946 at Camp Stoneman, CA. 
The 2nd Battalion, 185th Infantry, was redesignated on 5 August 1946 as the 223rd Infantry and remained assigned to the 40th Infantry Division (the 3rd Battalion, 185th Infantry, was concurrently redesignated as the 224th Infantry - hereafter separate lineage). The 223rd Infantry was organized and Federally recognized on 15 October 1946 with Headquarters at Pasadena Ordered into active Federal service on 1 September 1950 at home stations (the 223rd Infantry organized and was Federally recognized on 2 September 1952 with Headquarters at Pasadena). The unit was released on 30 June 1954 from active Federal service and reverted to state control; Federal recognition was concurrently withdrawn from the 223rd Infantry (NGUS). 
The 2nd Battalion, 223rd Infantry, consolidated with the 3rd Battalion, 111th Armored Cavalry (organized and Federally recognized on 26 January 1951 with Headquarters at Van Nuys on 1 November 1951 to Burbank); and the consolidated unit was concurrently reorganized and redesignated as the 139th Tank Battalion, with Headquarters at Burbank, and assigned to the 40th Armored Division (223rd Infantry - hereafter separate lineage).

21st Century activations and deployments.
In the 2003-2004 time period the unit was activated in support of Operation Noble Eagle. This was followed by a 14 month activation to provide a security force for Camp Delta which fell under the GWOT Campaign. During the 2007 California Wildfires approximately 400 Soldiers were activated by the Governor of California to assist local authorities in various functions. 1-18th Cavalry was called to active federal service along with the 79th IBCT in October 2008 in support of NATO peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo. 1-18th Cavalry subsequently returned to the U.S. in November 2009.

Margaret B. Laird

Margaret Brydon Laird (1871 - November 29, 1968) was a leader in the women's suffrage movement in New Jersey. She was one of the first two women to serve in the New Jersey Legislature, elected in 1920 as a Republican.
Life.
Laird trained as a nurse in Newark, New Jersey, graduating from Newark City Hospital (now The University Hospital) in 1895. She married Reginald M. Laird, a druggist from Newark, and they had two children.
Laird became actively involved in women's suffrage organizations. She served as vice president of the Women's Political Union, chair of the Newark chapter of the National Woman Suffrage Association, state treasurer of the National Women's Party, and organizer of the Newark Women's Republican Club. She campaigned for the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, which secured women's suffrage in 1920.
In 1920, Laird was one of two women, along with Jennie C. Van Ness, designated by the Essex County Republican Party to run on the twelve-person slate for the New Jersey General Assembly. Laird and Van Ness won, and became the first two women to serve in the state legislature. Also elected on the Essex County slate was Walter G. Alexander, the first African American to serve in the legislature.
Laird served two terms in the Assembly. She was active in establishing the state's juvenile court law, and she supported legislation for equal salaries for women employed by the state government. She declined to run for a third term because of the Assembly's late hours.
Laird remained active in local politics, serving as president of the Newark Women's Republican Club from 1926 to 1932. She died in 1968 at the age of 97, in a nursing home in Neptune, New Jersey.

Cummascach mac Congalaig

Cummascach mac Congalaig (died 839) was a King of Brega from the Uí Chonaing sept of Cnogba (Knowth) of the Síl nÁedo Sláine branch of the southern Ui Neill. He was the son of Congalach mac Conaing (died 778) and brother of Flann mac Congalaig (died 812) and Cernach mac Congalaig (died 818), previous kings. He ruled from 818-839.
The Uí Chonaing sept had conquered the lands of the Ciannachta (south of the Lower Boyne in modern County Meath, Ireland) and were often styled Kings of Ciannachta in this period. In 822 Cummascach defeated the remnants of this population group, the Ard Ciannachta (in County Louth), at the Battle of Carn Conain and their king, Eudus mac Tigernaig was slain. Cummascach then was confronted by a rival among his own sept named Dúnchad, they fought a skirmish in 824 in which Dúnchad was victorious and Cummascach escaped. Cummascach seems to have remained king, however, and the fate of this Dúnchad is unknown.
The Vikings became active in the midlands during his reign. In 827 they plundered Ciannachta. In 828 they slew the king of Ard Ciannachta, Cináed mac Cummascacig. In 832 The Vikings plundered Dom Líacc (Duleek) and the sept of the Ciannacht with all their churches. The Vikings also plundered the church of Sláine in 834.
In 837 a great fleet appeared on the Boyne and ravaged the plain of Brega defeating the Ui Neill in the Battle of Inber na mBárc on the Boyne estuary. The Ciannacht were, however, able to eventually win a victory over the Norse and slew their leader Saxolb. 
Cummascach died in 839 and is styled "rex Ciannactai" — King of Ciannachta — in the annals.

Miles D. McAlester

Miles Daniel McAlester (March 21, 1833 – April 23, 1869) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general during the American Civil War.
Early life and career.
McAlester was born in Belfast, New York. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in July 1852, and graduated four years later standing third out of 49 cadets. He was appointed a brevet second lieutenant on July 1, 1856, in the coveted Army Engineers. On December 1 he was promoted to second lieutenant.
Civil War service.
McAlester was the lead engineer for the Defenses of Washington from April 1861 until March 1862, during which he was promoted to first lieutenant on May 1, 1861. His next assignment was as chief engineer for the Army of the Potomac's III Corps from April to July 1862. During the Peninsula Campaign that March–July, McAlester was singled out twice for his conduct, winning brevets to major and to lieutenant colonel on July 1, 1862. 
That fall McAlester was appointed the lead engineer of the Department of Ohio from October 30, 1862 into January 1863, when he joined the Army of the Tennessee to perform the same duty until August 9. During this time he was promoted to captain in the Regular army to rank from March 3. Then he was lead engineer for the Defenses of Cincinnati from August 9 into July 1864. On July 15 he was made lead engineer of the Federal Department of the Gulf (Military Division of West Mississippi) until July 16, 1865. 
McAlester was in Alabama during the sieges of Forts Gaines and Morgan in August 1864, and was appointed a brevet colonel for his performance during these battles on August 23. He also won a brevet promotion to the rank of brigadier general for his conduct during the fight and capture of Mobile at the Battle of Fort Blakely on April 9, 1865.
Postbellum.
Following the end of the war McAlester chose to continue his career and remained in the small peacetime U.S. Army. He was promoted to major on March 7, 1867 and was at that rank when he died in Buffalo, New York in 1869. 
He was buried in Hollenback Cemetery in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
Engineer's plans.
During the course of his duties in the Civil War, McAlester prepared several detailed maps of Confederate fortifications the Federals encountered. Two of his plans are shown below, both depicting the defenses and approached to Confederate-held Fort Blakely at Mobile, Alabama, in 1865. They are included in the "Official Records", published in 1892.

Peter Nead

Peter Nead (7 January 1796 - 16 March 1877) was an American preacher in the German Baptist Brethren church. He wrote several theological works, which were (and remain) influential in the GBB and related churches, perhaps the most prominent being "A Vindication of Primitive Christianity." 
Life.
Nead was born in Hagerstown, Maryland, and was raised as a Lutheran. His family wanted him to become a Lutheran preacher, but he instead chose to learn the trade of a tanner. He later converted to the Methodist church, but then after reading a pamphlet from the Brethren church converted to that faith, and soon took up preaching.
In 1825 he married Elizabeth Yount, originally of Rockingham County, Virginia. He resided at the Tunker House until 1839. He later relocated to Augusta County, Virginia, then Botetourt County, and finally settled in 1850 near Dayton, Ohio where remained until his death, preaching at the Lower Stillwater church.
Ministry.
Nead was known as the "English preacher" because of his ability to preach in English. But his greatest impact was in his writings. In 1833 he published "A Vindication of Primitive Christianity," which was widely read. In 1845 he published "Baptism for the Remission of Sins." Both of these works were published together in 1850 as "Nead's Theological Works." His last book, "The Wisdom and Power of God, as Displayed in Creation and Redemption," was published in 1866. He assisted in launching and was a frequent contributor to the church periodical "The Vindicator," which was largely devoted to advocating against reformation of the church.

The Green Pajamas

The Green Pajamas are a musical group from Seattle, Washington. They formed in the spring of 1984 when Jeff Kelly and Joe Ross recorded and released their first album, "Summer Of Lust". They are probably best known for the regional hit single "Kim the Waitress".
The band released 32 albums between 1984 and 2013. The band has never been picked up by a major label.
History.
Joe Ross and Jeff Kelly met at a party and discovered a common interest in 60s psychedelia. Inspired by 1983's Los Angeles "paisley underground" music scene the duo decided to start a similar scene in their home town of Seattle. By spring of 1984 they had recorded and released a homemade cassette called "Summer of Lust"; it was described by one U.K. journalist as "British-style psychedelia similar to Dukes of the Stratosphear but more off-center and less pastiche".
The 7" record "Kim the Waitress" attracted regional college radio airplay in the mid-80s, and the band went on to record "Sister Anne", and the albums "Book Of Hours" and "Ghosts of Love", before breaking up during the sessions for "Ghosts of Love" (released 1990 to some critical attention on the L.A. label Bomp!). During the next few years, Jeff Kelly released solo recordings on cassette. The band re-united in 1994 in the wake of "Kim The Waitress" covers released that year by Material Issue and the Seattle band Sister Psychic. A third single, "Song for Christina", was released. (The Green Pajamas' early singles, including "Kim The Waitress", can be heard on the 1997 anthology "Indian Winter".)
With the 1999 release of "Seven Fathoms Down and Falling" on Nick Saloman's Woronzow records, they played the 1999 Terrastock 3 festival in London. They have been Terrastock regulars, playing at Terrastock 2 in San Francisco, #4 in Seattle and #6 in Providence, RI.
In 2009 the band returned to the Seattle record label where they started and has been putting out a steady stream of releases, both reissues and new material.
Discography.
Jeff Kelly has also recorded several solo albums, and three with Laura Weller as Goblin Market. Eric Lichter has recorded two solo albums as well as albums by the Picture Day and The Life.

15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze M 94

The 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze M 94 was a heavy howitzer used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It had a bronze barrel and relied on wheel ramps to absorb its recoil. The barrel was modified in 1899 as the M 99 and can be identified by its octagonal shape. Both howitzers could be mounted on a wide variety of carriages to suit their mission, including a carriage only wide for mountain use. Around the start of the 20th century both the M 94 and M 99 were modified to increase their elevation up to 65°. The elevation arc had to be extended and the trunnion mounts and wheels had to be strengthened to withstand the greater recoil forces when firing at high elevation. They were known as the M 94/4 and the M 99/4 after modification.

Antarctica

Antarctica ( or ) is Earth's southernmost continent, containing the geographic South Pole. It is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14.0 million km2 (5.4 million sq mi), it is the fifth-largest continent in area after Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages at least in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. Antarctica is considered a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200 mm (8 inches) along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached −89 °C (−129 °F). There are no permanent human residents, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Only cold-adapted organisms survive, including many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation where it occurs is tundra.
Although myths and speculation about a "Terra Australis" ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on "Vostok" and "Mirny" first sighted a continental ice shelf in 1820. The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of resources, and isolation.
The Antarctic Treaty was signed in 1959 by 12 countries; to date, 49 countries have signed the treaty. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's ecozone. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.
Etymology.
The name "Antarctica" is the romanized version of the Greek compound word "ἀνταρκτική" ("antarktiké"), feminine of "ἀνταρκτικός" ("antarktikos"), meaning "opposite to the Arctic", "opposite to the north".
Before getting its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other locations that could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established at Brazil in the 16th Century was called "France Antarctique".
The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew.
History of exploration.
Antarctica has no indigenous population and there is no evidence that it was seen by humans until the 19th century. However, belief in the existence of a "Terra Australis"—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of Europe, Asia and North Africa—had existed since the times of Ptolemy (1st century AD), who suggested the idea to preserve the symmetry of all known landmasses in the world. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.
Integral to the story of the origin of the name "Antarctica" is how it was not named "Terra Australis"—this name was given to Australia instead, and it was because of a mistake made by people who decided that a significant landmass would not be found further south of Australia. Explorer Matthew Flinders, in particular, has been credited with popularizing the transfer of the name "Terra Australis" to Australia. He justified the titling of his book "A Voyage to Terra Australis" (1814) by writing in the introduction:
European maps continued to show this hypothesized land until Captain James Cook's ships, HMS "Resolution" and "Adventure", crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773 and again in January 1774. Cook came within about of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773. The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals. According to various organizations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, and other sources), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820: von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (a sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut). The expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships "Vostok" and "Mirny", reached a point within from Queen Maud's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at that became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. This happened three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820. The first documented landing on Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis, apparently at Hughes Bay, near Cape Charles, in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821, although some historians dispute this claim. The first recorded and confirmed landing was at Cape Adair in 1895. 
On 22 January 1840, two days after the discovery of the coast west of the Balleny Islands, some members of the crew of the 1837–40 expedition of Jules Dumont d'Urville disembarked on the highest islet of a group of rocky islands about 4 km from Cape Géodésie on the coast of Adélie Land where they took some mineral, algae and animal samples.
In December 1839, as part of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–42 conducted by the United States Navy (sometimes called the "Ex. Ex.", or "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from Sydney, Australia, into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was later named "Wilkes Land", a name it maintains to this day.
Explorer James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the Ross Sea and discovered Ross Island (both of which were named for him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross Ice Shelf. Mount Erebus and Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: HMS "Erebus" and "Terror". Mercator Cooper landed in East Antarctica on 26 January 1853.
During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the leadership of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 – February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship "Fram" became the first to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.
Richard E. Byrd led several voyages to the Antarctic by plane in the 1930s and 1940s. He is credited with implementing mechanized land transport on the continent and conducting extensive geological and biological research. However, it was not until 31 October 1956 that anyone set foot on the South Pole again; on that day a U.S. Navy group led by Rear Admiral George J. Dufek successfully landed an aircraft there.
The first person to sail single-handed to Antarctica was the New Zealander David Henry Lewis, in 1972, in a 10-metre steel sloop "Ice Bird".
Geography.
Positioned asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean; alternatively, it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, or by the southern waters of the World Ocean. It covers more than , making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times as large as Europe. The coastline measures and is mostly characterized by ice formations, as the following table shows:
Antarctica is divided in two by the Transantarctic Mountains close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the Greenwich meridian.
About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, a sheet of ice averaging at least thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's fresh water). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about . In most of the interior of the continent, precipitation is very low, down to per year; in a few "blue ice" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by sublimation and so the local mass balance is negative. In the dry valleys, the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.
West Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, ocean levels would rise by several metres in a relatively geologically short period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic ice streams, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow to one of the many Antarctic ice shelves: see ice-sheet dynamics.
East Antarctica lies on the Indian Ocean side of the Transantarctic Mountains and comprises Coats Land, Queen Maud Land, Enderby Land, <abbr title="Macpherson">Mac</abbr>. Robertson Land, Wilkes Land, and Victoria Land. All but a small portion of this region lies within the Eastern Hemisphere. East Antarctica is largely covered by the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.
Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica at , is located in the Ellsworth Mountains. Antarctica contains many other mountains, on both the main continent and the surrounding islands. Mount Erebus on Ross Island is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on Deception Island, which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active. In 2004, an underwater volcano was found in the Antarctic Peninsula by American and Canadian researchers. This unnamed volcano may be active.
Antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.
There is some evidence, in the form of ice cores drilled to about above the water line, that Lake Vostok's waters may contain microbial life. The frozen surface of the lake shares similarities with Jupiter's moon, Europa. If life was discovered in Lake Vostok, it would strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on Europa. On 7 February 2008, a NASA team embarked on a mission to Lake Untersee, searching for extremophiles in its highly alkaline waters. If found, these resilient creatures could further bolster the argument for extraterrestrial life in extremely cold, methane-rich environments.
Geology.
Geological history and paleontology.
More than 170 million years ago, Antarctica was part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.
Paleozoic era (540–250 Ma).
During the Cambrian period, Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the Northern Hemisphere, and during this period large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the Devonian period (416 Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centered around the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period, the plant life became dominated by fern-like plants such as "Glossopteris", which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.
Mesozoic era (250–66 Ma).
As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, seed ferns became established, and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. Synapsids, commonly known as "mammal-like reptiles", were common in Antarctica during the Late Permian and Early Triassic and included forms such as "Lystrosaurus". The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period (206–146 Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. Ginkgo trees and cycads were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, coniferous forests dominated through the entire Cretaceous period (146–66 Ma), though Southern beech became more prominent towards the end of this period. Ammonites were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only three Antarctic dinosaur genera ("Cryolophosaurus" and "Glacialisaurus", from the Hanson Formation, and "Antarctopelta") have been described to date. It was during this period that Gondwana began to break up.
Gondwanaland breakup (160–23 Ma).
The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise, as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalizing currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.
Africa separated from Antarctica around 160 Ma, followed by the Indian subcontinent, in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a marsupial fauna. About 40 Ma Australia-New Guinea separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear. During the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago, CO2 levels have been found to be about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm.
Around 23 Ma, the Drake Passage opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO2 levels became more important. The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent.
Neogene Period (23–0.05 mya).
Since about 15 Ma, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.
Intermittent warm periods allowed Nothofagus shrubs to cling to the Sirius group in the Dominion Range as late as 3–4 Ma. After that the Pleistocene ice-age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.
Geology of present-day Antarctica.
The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by the fact that nearly all of the continent is permanently covered with a thick layer of ice. However, new techniques such as remote sensing, ground-penetrating radar and satellite imagery have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.
Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the Andes mountain range of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula was formed by uplift and metamorphism of sea bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by igneous intrusions and volcanism. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are andesite and rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the Ellsworth Mountains region, where the stratigraphy is more similar to the eastern part of the continent.
East Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the Precambrian era, with some rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago. It is composed of a metamorphic and igneous platform which is the basis of the continental shield. On top of this base are various modern rocks, such as sandstones, limestones, coal and shales laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the Transantarctic Mountains. In coastal areas such as Shackleton Range and Victoria Land some faulting has occurred.
The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal. It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the oil and natural gas fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is banned until 2048 by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
Climate.
Antarctica is the coldest of Earth's continents. The coldest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was at the Soviet (now Russian) Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983. For comparison, this is 11 °C (20 °F) colder than subliming dry ice at one atmosphere of partial pressure, but since CO2 only makes up 0.039% of air, temperatures of less than -150 °C would be needed to produce dry ice snow in Antarctica. Antarctica is a frozen desert with little precipitation; the South Pole itself receives less than per year, on average. Temperatures reach a minimum of between and in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between and near the coast in summer. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.
East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to in 48 hours have been recorded.
At the edge of the continent, strong katabatic winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the equator because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.
Antarctica is colder than the Arctic for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world. Third, the Earth is at aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is furthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.
The aurora australis, commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full solar winds that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is diamond dust, a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A sun dog, a frequent atmospheric optical phenomenon, is a bright "spot" beside the true sun.
Population.
Several governments maintain permanent manned research stations on the continent. The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a population density between and at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An Orthodox church, Trinity Church, opened in 2004 at the Russian Bellingshausen Station is also manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.
The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the Antarctic Convergence) were British and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on South Georgia, from 1786 onward. During the whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included Grytviken, Leith Harbour, King Edward Point, Stromness, Husvik, Prince Olav Harbour, Ocean Harbour and Godthul. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain Carl Anton Larsen, a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.
The first child born in the southern polar region was Norwegian girl Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen, born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of South Georgia. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.
Emilio Marcos Palma was the first person born south of the 60th parallel south (the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty), as well as the first one born on the Antarctic mainland, in 1978 at Base Esperanza, on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the Argentine government to determine if family life was suitable on the continent. In 1984, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Frei Montalva Station, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station. In 2009, eleven children were born in Antarctica (south of the 60th parallel south): eight at the Argentinean Esperanza Base and three at the Chilean Frei Montalva Station.
Biodiversity.
Animals.
Few terrestrial vertebrates live in Antarctica. Invertebrate life includes microscopic mites like the "Alaskozetes antarcticus", lice, nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, krill and springtails. The flightless midge "Belgica antarctica", up to in size, is the largest purely terrestrial animal in Antarctica. The snow petrel is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica.
A variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.
The Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Weddell seal, a "true seal", is named after Sir James Weddell, commander of British sealing expeditions in the Weddell Sea. Antarctic krill, which congregates in large schools, is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other birds.
A census of sea life carried out during the International Polar Year and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of . Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms, sea cucumbers and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution – fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5 °C, and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport egg and larva stages.
Fungi.
About 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to UV-light. Those features are observed in different Antarctic fungi which can be shown by molecular studies to belong in different taxonomic orders. They can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as "Cryomyces minteri". Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.
Plants.
The climate of Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor soil quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes. There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts), but only two species of flowering plants, both of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula: "Deschampsia antarctica" (Antarctic hair grass) and "Colobanthus quitensis" (Antarctic pearlwort). Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.
Other organisms.
Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are phytoplankton. Multicolored snow algae and diatoms are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer. Recently ancient ecosystems consisting of several types of bacteria have been found living trapped deep beneath glaciers. The autotrophic community is made up of mostly protists.
On 6 February 2013, scientists reported that bacteria were found living in the cold and dark in a lake buried a half-mile deep under the ice in Antarctica.
Conservation.
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also known as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main instrument concerned with conservation and management of biodiversity in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.
The passing of the Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000 tonnes (35,300 short tons) in 2000.
Politics.
Antarctica has no government, although various countries claim sovereignty in certain regions. While a few of these countries have mutually recognized each other's claims, the validity of these claims is not recognized universally.
New claims on Antarctica have been suspended since 1959 and the continent is considered politically neutral. Its status is regulated by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System. Antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60° S for the purposes of the Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the United States. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on the continent. This was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.
In 1983, the Antarctic Treaty Parties began negotiations on a convention to regulate mining in Antarctica. A coalition of international organizations launched a public pressure campaign to prevent any minerals development in the region, led largely by Greenpeace International which established its own scientific station–World Park Base–in the Ross Sea region and conducted annual expeditions to document environmental effects of humans on the continent. In 1988, the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources (CRAMRA) was adopted. The following year, however, Australia and France announced that they would not ratify the convention, rendering it dead for all intents and purposes. They proposed instead that a comprehensive regime to protect the Antarctic environment be negotiated in its place. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the 'Madrid Protocol') was negotiated as other countries followed suit and on 14 January 1998 it entered into force. The Madrid Protocol bans all mining in Antarctica, designating the continent as a 'natural reserve devoted to peace and science'.
The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any military activity in Antarctica, including the establishment of military bases and fortifications, military manoeuvers, and weapons testing. Military personnel or equipment are permitted only for scientific research or other peaceful purposes. The only documented military land manoeuvre was Operation NINETY by the Argentine military.
The United States military issues the Antarctica Service Medal to military members or civilians who perform research duty in Antarctica. The medal includes a "wintered over" bar issued to those who remain on the continent for two six-month seasons.
Antarctic territories.
The Argentine, British, and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction. On 18 December 2012, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office named a previously unnamed area Queen Elizabeth Land in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, John Freeman, was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim. Argentine-UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the sovereignty of the nearby Falkland Islands, and the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War.
The areas shown as Australia's and New Zealand's claims were British territory until they were handed over following the countries' independence. Australia currently claims the largest area. The claims of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway are all recognized by each other.
Other countries participating as members of Antarctic Treaty have a territorial interest in the Antarctic continent but the provisions of the Treaty do not allow them to make their claims while it is in force.
Economy.
There is no economic activity in Antarctica at present, except for fishing off the coast and small-scale tourism, both based outside Antarctica. The Antarctican dollar, a souvenir item sold in the United States and Canada, is not legal tender.
Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934 tonnes.
Small-scale "expedition tourism" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO). Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO, but IAATO members account for 95% of the tourist activity. Travel is largely by small or medium ship, focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife. A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006–07 Austral summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships. The number was predicted to increase to over 80,000 by 2010.
There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. A call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota has been made by some environmentalists and scientists. The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, "site use guidelines" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sight seeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard. Qantas resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.
Antarctic fisheries in 1998–1999 (1 July – 30 June) reported landing 119,898 tonnes. Unregulated fishing landed five to six times more than the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing in Antarctic waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and Australia) of at least eight fishing ships. See Ocean fisheries#Southern Ocean.
About 30 countries maintain about seventy research stations (40 year-round or permanent, and 30 summer-only) in Antarctica, with an approximate population of 4000 in summer and 1000 in winter.
Research.
Each year, scientists from 28 different nations conduct experiments not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate research stations; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter. McMurdo Station, which is the largest research station in Antarctica, is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.
Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. Geologists tend to study plate tectonics, meteorites from outer space, and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating ice, seasonal snow, glaciers, and ice sheets. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station study the celestial dome and cosmic microwave background radiation. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere, low temperature, which minimizes the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, and absence of light pollution, thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest neutrino telescope in the world, built below Amundsen-Scott station.
Since the 1970s, an important focus of study has been the ozone layer in the atmosphere above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at Halley Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by chlorofluorocarbons emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the Montreal Protocol of 1989, it is believed that the ozone hole will close up by around 2065.
In September 2006, NASA satellite data revealed that the Antarctic ozone hole was larger than at any other time on record, 27.5 million km2 (10.6 million sq mi).
On 6 September 2007, Belgian-based International Polar Foundation unveiled the Princess Elisabeth station, the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to research climate change. Costing $16.3 million, the prefabricated station, which is part of International Polar Year, was shipped to the South Pole from Belgium by the end of 2008 to monitor the health of the polar regions. Belgian polar explorer Alain Hubert stated: "This base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions, making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the Antarctic." Johan Berte is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which conducts research in climatology, glaciology and microbiology.
In January 2008, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported (in the journal Nature Geoscience) that 2,200 years ago, a volcano erupted under Antarctica's ice sheet (based on airborne survey with radar images). The biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.
Meteorites.
Meteorites from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the solar system; most are thought to come from asteroids, but some may have originated on larger planets. The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the Adelie Land meteorite. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.
This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.
In 2006, a team of researchers from Ohio State University used gravity measurements by NASA's GRACE satellites to discover the -wide Wilkes Land crater, which probably formed about 250 million years ago.
In January 2013, an meteorite was discovered frozen in ice on the Nansen ice field by a Search for Antarctic Meteorites, Belgian Approach (SAMBA) mission.
Ice mass and global sea level.
Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.
Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The extent of sea ice around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.
Melting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.
On the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water. This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea. West Antarctica is currently experiencing a net outflow of glacial ice, which will increase global sea level over time. A review of the scientific studies looking at data from 1992 to 2006 suggested that a net loss of around 50 gigatonnes of ice per year was a reasonable estimate (around 0.14 mm of sea level rise). Significant acceleration of outflow glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment may have more than doubled this figure for 2006.
East Antarctica is a cold region with a ground base above sea level and occupies most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet as a whole is thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.
Effects of global warming.
Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by fall cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions. However, the small amount of surface warming in West Antarctica is not believed to be directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.
In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a "thread" of ice about wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as .
A study published in the sixth edition of the "Nature Geoscience" journal in 2013 (published online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature record from Antarctica's Byrd Station and assert that it "reveals a linear increase in annual temperature between 1958 and 2010 by 2.4±1.2 °C". At the time that the research was published, the American researchers were affiliated with The Ohio State University, the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Ozone depletion.
Each year a large area of low ozone concentration or "ozone hole" grows over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December. The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the ozone into other gases.
Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 °C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea-ice just offshore of the continent.

The World Tossed at Tennis

The World Tossed at Tennis is a Jacobean era masque composed by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley, first published in 1620. It was likely acted on 4 March 1620 (new style) at Denmark House.
Middleton and Rowley conducted one of the most interesting collaborative efforts in English Renaissance drama; together they produced significant works, "The Changeling" and "A Fair Quarrel". Their only masque is one of the stranger and more original literary products of their generation.
Publication.
"A Courtly Masque; the Device called, the World tost at Tennis" was entered into the Stationers' Register on 4 July 1620, and published later that year in a quarto printed by George Purslowe for the stationer Edward Wright. The title page assigns authorship to Middleton and Rowley; it states that the work was performed "diverse times" by Rowley's acting company, Prince Charles's Men.
The first edition bears Middleton's dedication to Charles Howard, Baron of Effingham and his wife Mary Lady Effingham, the daughter of Sir William Cockayne, a Lord Mayor of London. It also includes an address to the reader signed by "Simplicity," a Prologue, and a list of "The Figures and Persons" in the masque.
Authorship.
In their other collaborations, Middleton takes primary responsibility for the main plot, and Rowley handles subplot materials – usually comic, but also serious, as in "A Fair Quarrel". The standard dichotomy of main plot and subplot does not apply to their masque; in this work, Rowley was mainly responsible for the first half of the work, the first 471 lines, and Middleton the second half, 515 lines. The break between the two writers' shares comes just after the masque's oddest and most original feature, the introduction of the personifications of five coloured starches.
The message.
The masque was commissioned by Prince Charles. The intent of the masque was to influence his father, King James I, to move away from his pacifistic foreign policy. In 1620, the Thirty Years' War was in its first phase; James daughter and Charles's sister Princess Elizabeth and her husband Frederick V, Elector Palatine had inadvertently started the war when they accepted the crown of Bohemia in 1618.
Despite his strong familial connection, James was unwilling to take an active part in the Protestant cause, much to the distress of many of his subjects. The masque had no discernible success in swaying James's position.
The masque.
The masque features the mythological divinities and personifications that are standard in the masque genre: Jupiter and Pallas Athena are present, as are Time and Deceit, the nine Muses and the Nine Worthies. There is a King and a Lawyer, a "Land-Captain" and a "Sea-Captain," and the Devil as well. The second half of the work, Middleton's portion, is dominated by the adventures of Deceit as he interacts with the other characters. Eventually Deceit is defeated by the Lawyer, and the Devil is defeated by the Church.
The masque also contains unusual characters; the Induction is a conversation among three personified English royal palaces, St. James's, Richmond, and Denmark House. And the first of the masque's three dances is performed by, of all things, five different-coloured Starches. To appropriate music – "a light fantastic air" and "a ridiculous strain" – five figures representing coloured starches, white, blue, yellow, green and red, "come dancing in." After their dance, they quarrel; White demands precedence over the others, but they resist. As Yellow puts it, "I am as stiff i' my opinion / As any Starch amongst you."
The Starches are examples of what Jupiter calls the "Deceit and Pride" of the age, characterised by "The frenzy of apparel," "masculine painting," and "Vain-glory, fashion, humour, and such toys."
Why five starches?
In the second decade of the seventeenth century, Mistress Anne Turner started a new fashion. It had long been standard in Elizabethan and Jacobean clothing to wear starched white ruffs and cuffs, commonly called "bands." The famous and often-reproduced portrait of actor Edward Alleyn (seen here) provides a good view of the prevailing style. Mrs. Turner was the first person in England to dye these white bands yellow. The fashion became famous and notorious when Turner, an associate of Simon Forman and a denizen of the Jacobean demimonde, was executed on 15 November 1615 for her role in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury.
When Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke (in traditional white bands here) sentenced Turner to death, he specifically instructed that she should die in yellow bands: "as she was the person who had brought yellow starched ruffs into vogue, she should be hanged in that dress, that the same might end in shame and detestation." According to at least one report, the hangman also wore yellow bands as he put Turner to death.
References to yellow bands and yellow starch recur in plays of the 1615–18 era, by Middleton and others – "A Fair Quarrel", "The Widow", "More Dissemblers Besides Women", "Albumazar", "The Queen of Corinth", "The Devil is an Ass", and "Christmas, His Masque". (Robert Davenport's plays of uncertain date, "The City Nightcap" and "A New Trick to Cheat the Devil", also contain such references.) "The World Tossed at Tennis" is unique in that it refers not only to white and yellow starch but to red, green, and blue starch too. Were these other colours worn in ruffs and cuffs in the years around 1620? The text of the masque suggests this was so, though supporting evidence is thin.
The fashion for yellow bands lasted in Court circles until the mid-1620s.

1959 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand

In 1959, the British Lions rugby union team toured Australia and New Zealand. The Lions won the two test matches against but lost the international series against the All Blacks by three matches to one. They also played two matches in Canada, on the return leg of the journey.
Although New Zealand won the series, the results in three of the tests were close. The Lions scored four tries to nil in the first test but six penalties by Don Clarke saw the All Blacks win 18-17. Clarke also scored a late try and conversion to win the second test, 11-8. New Zealand won the third test comfortably by 22-8 to win the series but the fourth test, which the Lions won 9-6, could have gone the All Blacks way had Clarke not missed a late penalty attempt. 
Overall the tourists played thirty-three matches, winning twenty-seven and losing six. In Australia the Lions played six matches, winning five and losing one, to New South Wales. In New Zealand they played twenty-five matches, winning twenty and losing five - in addition to their three test defeats they also lost to Otago and Canterbury. They also played two matches in Canada, winning both.
The tour was notable for the 842 points scored in 33 games, a record number of points for a Lions tour and for the 22 tries scored by Tony O'Reilly, also a Lions tour record.
The touring party was captained by Ronnie Dawson. The manager was A. W. Wilson and the assistant manager was O.B. Glasgow.

Dark Eyes (play)

Dark Eyes is a play written by Elena Miramova (in collaboration with Eugenie Leontovich) that premiered in 1943. The comedy centres on three Russian-American actresses who have fallen into serious financial trouble and are urgently seeking a backer for their new play. The story is based upon an earlier Miramova work called "Love Is Not a Potato"; the play originally was titled "To the Purple."
Plot summary.
The play is set in the Field family home in Long Island, New York, on a summer day in 1942. It opens with Larry revealing that John has just phoned about his early return from Washington, D.C.; John is very weary from this business trip and doesn't want to see anyone. Helen is dismayed at this news, for she has already invited her fiancé, Nikolai, over for the evening. She then receives a telegram from Nikolai, telling her that he will be coming with three of his Russian friends for her to meet. Nervously, the two siblings prepare to receive their father, Nikolai, and three unexpected guests.
The three women - Natasha, Tonia, and Olga - arrive, and Nikolai speaks privately with them. 
Their conversation reveals that the three women have just been evicted; Nikolai then discovers that they wrote a check to their landlord from a closed bank account. He informs them that the police will be looking for them and advises them to be kind to the Field family as their only hope of aid. They return to the Fields' living room as John arrives home, and everyone meets and converses. The three actresses then employ their singing and dancing talents to celebrate Grandmother Field's birthday in grand style.
Tonia talks with John and discusses the difficulty of finding acting work in New York when one is typecast as a "Continental actress." She then confides in him that she and Natasha have written a play that "no-one in the world can act but we ourselves," a tragedy about two sisters still in love with a man who is dead. John is amused by the plot description and by Tonia's odd intensity, and he volunteers to pay the initial cost of their play's production: five hundred dollars, the exact amount of their bad check. The three ladies are overcome with gratitude and joy, and Act 1 ends with them weeping over their sudden good fortune.
Act 2 sets the scene in a guest bedroom, the temporary residence of Tonia and Natasha. Larry comes to the room to profess his adoration to Natasha, and his declarations are interrupted by Nikolai, who escorts the drunk Larry out and then returns to make his own confession. Nikolai tells Natasha that he still cares for her and that Helen has left him. The disbelieving Natasha chides him, reminding him of the war and scolding him for "playing love games" while Russia is fighting for its existence. She tells him that if he will do battle for their homeland, he will have her love and loyalty forever when he returns. He resolves to leave for the Army the next morning.
Natasha and Tonia, finally left alone, talk about John, and Natasha implies that he is only financing their play because he wants to sleep with Tonia. The religious Tonia is horrified and decides to call John to their room to discover the truth. He arrives, and the three argue; John eventually gives up reasoning with the women, who have come to believe that he is only backing their play out of pity and are furious. John exits, and then Tonia begins to weep; she has fallen in love with John and had hoped he would declare his feelings for her.
The next morning, Natasha discovers that Nikolai was indeed lying and that Helen had not broken their engagement. Distraught and heartbroken, both Natasha and Tonia resolve to return to New York City - on foot if they must - then decide that life is no longer worth living anywhere. They drink poison from a bottle in Natasha's suitcase and calmly sit together, awaiting death.
John then knocks on their door. He has already spoken to Olga that morning, and he explains that he knows their landlord and will take care of their financial trouble. He then gives Tonia the promised check for the play and invites them all to stay at the Field home for as long as they wish. Tonia, overjoyed, reveals that she loves him; he makes his declaration to her in return, then leaves to see Larry and Nikolai off to their enlistment in the Canadian army. Tonia suddenly remembers the poison and panics. The house flies into a flurry of concern, and amidst the hysteria, Olga enters. She smells the bottle and laughs, reminding Tonia and Natasha that she had emptied out the poison years before and replaced it with peach brandy.
The play ends with the three Russians elated, their troubles over and a rosy future ahead, and Tonia (who is to marry John) declares that she no longer wants to produce a tragedy; instead, she begins to describe her idea for a marvelous comedy, about three downtrodden actresses invited to spend a weekend in Long Island.
Issues in the script.
The play begins "late afternoon of a summer day in 1942" and concludes the following morning. The exact days involved seem clear after an Act I discussion between Nikolai and Natasha:
"Niko: When was the check dated?"
"Natasha: The 20th. I could not remember the date at the moment. I was too furious. So I put the 20th."
"Niko: That was yesterday, Friday."
However, only in February, March, and November 1942 did the 20th fall on a Friday; there were no summer months in which this was the case.
The script also uses a phonetic rendering of the Russian speech and songs, presumably to aid non-Russian actors in pronunciation, but gives no translation (except in rare instances in which the Russians explain their dialogue to the Fields, or in which the lines are immediately paraphrased or answered in English). Finally, the text references songs by simple, common names ("Natasha starts to sing "Night,"" for example), but does not provide the complete song titles or music.
From conception to Broadway.
The idea for the play came to Miramova in 1939, when she and Leontovich awkwardly and conspicuously visited the home of a well-to-do American family; she imagined that their gloomy weekend might form the basis of a delightful comedy. "Dark Eyes" spoofed the peculiarities of the Russian character, and it also included many references to the personalities and careers of its three main actresses. (For example, one comedic moment in the play comes when Natasha bitterly complains about the bleak future for typecast Russian-American actresses and sarcastically points out that perhaps the women will be invited in ten years to play "aging Russian ballerinas - if we're not crippled with rheumatism by then." Contemporary audiences may have understood the joke, if they remembered that both Leontovich and Miramova had played the Russian ballerina Grusinskaya in the popular 1931 play "Grand Hotel".)
Though she had no playwriting experience, a less-than-perfect command of the English language, and had already been told by the playwright Moss Hart that her idea was charming but unworkable, Miramova began work on "Dark Eyes" shortly thereafter, spending three months at her typewriter from seven in the morning until midnight. She later called on Leontovich for help; their collaboration came in the form of long walks, during which they discussed the play's second draft. She sent the completed manuscript to producer Ben Hecht for an opinion, and Hecht invited the three actresses for dinner at the Hecht home, along with Broadway director Jed Harris. Harris, absent from the theatre scene for five years prior, had already struck a deal with Twentieth Century Fox for the company to finance an unspecified number of his plays. "Dark Eyes" was the first play accepted for performance under this agreement.
The play had a brief preview on Christmas Eve in Baltimore. It then officially opened at 8:40 p.m., 14 January 1943 at the Belasco Theatre in New York. It closed on 31 July 1943 after a successful run of 230 performances.
Other performances.
The cast next traveled to Manhattan's Audubon Theatre in mid-August 1943 and then appeared at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., 13–18 September 1943.
The play was performed in 1947 at the Olney Theatre Center in Maryland.
The show played for six nights at the Newport Harbour High School Auditorium in California, beginning 21 June 1948. Eugenie Leontovich reprised her original role as Natasha Rapakovich.
Finally, the play ran in March 1948 at the Strand Theatre in Westminster, London, England, with Yul Brynner performing in the cast.
Performances after 1948, if any, are unknown. The script is published by the Dramatists Play Service but is currently out-of-print.
The film.
In March 1943, Warner Brothers purchased the film rights to "Dark Eyes" for $250,000. A few weeks later, Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan, and Julie Bishop were cast to play the three Russian ladies, and a release date of June 1944 was set.
In October 1944, Jack Benny joined the cast, and Jerry Wald was named as the film's producer; the release date was pushed back to 1945. However, it appears that the film was never completed.
Response to the play.
"The New York Times" praised "Dark Eyes" after its opening night performance, dubbing it "a very engaging, entertaining and charming play that is beautifully directed and acted to the last line that is in it."
"TIME" magazine reviewed the play on 25 January 1943 and praised the skillful acting and directing, but panned the "wobbly playwriting" of the script and the "monotonous" nature of the comedy.
Theatre critic George Jean Nathan recognised "Dark Eyes" as the Best Farce-Comedy of the Year in 1943, calling it "intelligently entertaining playgoing."
The play enjoyed widespread success with its American performances; one audience letter referred to the "unanimous approval of the New York critics," and director Jed Harris related, "This "Dark Eyes" is proving a real hit--no question about it." The opinion abroad was also positive, with "The London News-Chronicle" calling the Russians' antics "utterly absurd but very enjoyable" and promoting the play as "a delirious farce of slight pretensions." Published audience letters agreed with official sources, with one writer stating that Miramova "deserves the success she is having" with her "hilarious comedy."

J-BIS

The J-BIS Biounit is an immigration control system that was introduced into Japanese airports. It is a machine that is located at the immigration booth. When a person who wishes to enter the country and applies for disembarkation, fingerprints of both index fingers are collected along with a photograph. At the same time, the person is checked against immigration office lists, and criminals, people who were previously deported, and other punished foreigners are prevented from entering the country. On November 20, 2007, Narita Airport, Kansai International Airport, and Chūbu Centrair International Airport had the system, with plans to roll out the system to the 27 airports and 126 harbors in the country.
Summary.
Until the start of J-BIS, when people would land in Japan and apply for entry, it was difficult to tell which people had changed their names or used special names on their passports, had been deported, or had criminal records. After the events of 9/11, Japan amended its Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act.
On November 20, 2007, the changes to the act went into effect. Most foreigners (everyone except special permanent residents, diplomats, people who were invited by the government, and people under the age of 16) were now required to have fingerprints taken from their two index fingers, as well as a photograph. The J-BIS system was the second system of its type enacted in the world; the first was the USA's US-VISIT system.
The fingerprint scans and photographs are transferred from the airport to the immigration office's servers, and this information is compared against a blacklist in around five seconds.
This list is a collection of Interpol information and around 14,000 people that have been searched by Japanese police, as well as the fingerprints and pictures that were recorded from around 800,000 foreigners who were deported from Japan. According to the immigration office, it is predicted that 0.001% of people who enter Japan appear on the blacklist.
Since the introduction of the system, 846 people were received exclusion orders by immigration authorities and 8 people were arrested for fabricating their fingerprints. The Japan Coast Guard also reported that the number of smugglers crossing the Korea Strait from the Korean peninsula has increased rapidly.
Procedure for entering the country under J-BIS.
For people who apply to enter the country, they stand in front of the J-BIS machine at the immigration booth. They follow the instructions displayed on a monitor, and put both fingers on a glass pane, and after their fingerprints are scanned (it takes about 1 second) they hear a chime. Next, the terminal screen changes, and after a few seconds, their picture is taken by a camera mounted above the screen.
Automated gate.
Along with the introduction of J-BIS, an "Automated gate" (自動化ゲート) was set up at Terminal 1 and 2 at Narita Airport. With this system, when a person enters or leaves the country, rather than having to be processed by an examiner there, a person can use a machine at the gate, thereby making both entry and departure simpler and easier, as well as more convenient. Japanese people with valid passports, foreigners with both valid passports (this includes refugees with valid travel certificates and re-entry permits) and re-entry permits can use this system.
The gate works by holding up the identification page of the passport up to the terminal in front of the transparent booth, and the entrance to the booth will open. Inside the booth, there is an equipment to read fingerprints, where prints from two fingers are taken. After confirmation, if the person is confirmed to be him or herself, the exit gate will open. Although there is a worker sitting at the gate, according to the Ministry of Justice immigration office's information guide to the automated gates, most Japanese should be able to use the automated gate. When the automated gate is used, the entry/departure stamp is not affixed to one's passport. When a seal is needed, officials are available near the gate to affix the seal; alternatively, one can use the regular gate.
When one wants to use the gate, a person must register beforehand. For details, see the Ministry of Justice immigration office's information guide. For this advance registration, Japanese people (those who hold Japanese passports), only fingerprints are needed (not an image), as the automated gate does not take a picture.

Anemonopsis

Anemonopsis is a monotypic genus in the family Ranunculaceae, containing only the species Anemonopsis macrophylla.
Description.
"Anemonopsis" is a herbaceous perennial growing approximately 75 cm high, with pale lavender flowers in late summer, each about 2 cm in diameter. The flowers are bowl-shaped with a rosette of petals in the center, and are downward facing. The flowers are held well above the foliage; although not a small plant, the overall impression is one of daintiness and airiness.
Native to the Japanese island of Honshu, "Anemonopsis" is frost hardy at least to zone 4. It is a true woodland plant and cannot tolerate full sun without the leaves scorching, except perhaps in very cool, damp climates. It must also be protected from drying winds.
Cultivation.
Like many other herbaceous perennials from Japan, "Anemonopsis" demands summer moisture, but resents excessively wet conditions in winter. It is thus much more easily grown in continental climate of the eastern United States and Canada than in the Mediterranean climate of the Pacific Northwest.
Propagation.
"Anemonopsis" is self-fertile and an isolated plant will set modest amounts of seed. If sown in containers as soon as ripe and the seed containers exposed to winter chilling, germination will occur the next spring. Unlike some members of the Ranunculaceae, which are notorious for their seeds remaining viable only for a very short time, "Anemonopsis" seed retains its viability in storage to a reasonable degree. However, fresh seed is preferable to stored seed.
As with many other members of the Ranunculaceae, seedlings of "Anemonopsis" form only cotyledons in their first season; the first true leaves form the year after germination. Seedlings are slow to reach maturity, and flower in about 5 years. They may be more easily handled by growing in pots until they reach a size suitable for planting out.
No particular treatment of seed is necessary other than exposure to ordinary winter chilling.
"Anemonopsis" can also be propagated by division.

In 1994, he was convicted of ordering the murder of a journalist and was executed by Lithuania. Dekanidze was the last person executed by Lithuania prior to its abolition of the death penalty in 1998.
Biography.
Dekanidze was born in Lithuania to Georgian Jewish immigrants. He was a stateless person, not having been granted citizenship in Lithuania or Georgia. In Vilnius, he was a leader of the Vilnius Brigade mafia group. The "Vilnius Brigade" mostly consists of ethnic Lithuanians, although Boris Dekanidze as well as his brother were Georgian Jews.
In 1993, after receiving a number of death threats, Vitas Lingys, one of the founders and publishers of the newspaper "Respublika", was shot at point-blank range near his home in Vilnius. Dekanidze was arrested and charged with ordering the murder, which police said was carried out by Igor Akhremov.
In a 1994 trial, Dekanidze was convicted of deliberate murder by a three-judge panel. Dakanidze claimed he was innocent, and the evidence against him was primarily the testimony of Akhremov, who claimed to have carried out the killing on Dekanidze's orders. On 10 November 1994, Dekanidze was sentenced to death and Akhremov was sentenced to life imprisonment. Lithuanian authorities shut down a nuclear power plant after a terrorist threat was made against it the day after the convictions were handed down. Dekanidze appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, but it ruled in February 1995 that there were no grounds for reviewing the death sentence. His appeal for clemency to President Algirdas Brazauskas was also refused.
Dekanidze was executed on 12 July 1995 in Vilnius by a single shot to the back of his head. The execution has been criticised at being carried out even as the Lithuanian parliament was debating abolition of the death penalty.
No one has been executed by Lithuania since Dekanidze's death. Lithuania abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 1998 after the Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional.

Honda Civic (seventh generation)

The seventh generation of the Honda Civic was released in September 2000 as 2001 model. Compared to its predecessor, it retained similar exterior dimensions, but increased significantly in interior space thus bumping up Civic to a compact car size segment. There was a flat rear floor, giving better comfort to the rear seat passengers. This generation abandoned the front double wishbone suspension, which had been used in the fourth to sixth generations, replacing it with MacPherson strut.
At its introduction in 2000, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award for a record fourth time, and it won the Japan Automotive Researchers' and Journalists' Conference Car of the Year award in 2001.
A engine powered all Civics (except EX and Si), up from the previous model. Power in the EX remained at , and all non-Si engines were stroked to 1.7 liters for North America. Smaller engines continued to be available for the rest of the world.
History.
In 2003, the Civic was given new tail lights which created a circle when illuminated. For 2004, the Civic was given a facelifted front end with new headlights, bumper, and grille; it also received side skirts. In 2005 the U.S Honda introduced the Special Edition. It was available in LX or EX Special Edition.
The hybrid version arrived at North America in spring 2002. It used both a small 1.3 L I4 main gasoline engine and auxiliary electric motors, producing a combined 93 hp. The electric motors are powered by a battery array which is charged by regenerative braking during deceleration, thus reducing exhaust emissions and extending fuel mileage to 46 mpg city / 51 mpg highway with the manual transmission according to EPA fuel mileage estimates.
A sporting hatchback model called the Si was unveiled in August 2005 for the European market only. This model featured from launch a 1.4 L I-DSI and a 1.8 L i-VTEC rated at 83 PS (81 hp/61 kW) and 140 PS (138 hp/103 kW) respectively, with 177 and 207 km/h (110 and 129 mph) top speeds and 14.2 and 13.6 s 0–100 km/h sprint. The Sport Hatchback is also available with a 2.2 L I-CTDI diesel engine from the Accord, Edix/FR-V and CR-V, rated at 140 PS (138 hp/103 kW) and is capable of 205 km/h (127 mph) and accelerating from 0-60 mph in 8.4 seconds.
Starting with this generation, cabin air filters (also known as pollen filters) were installed as standard equipment and are located behind the glove compartment internationally.
Trim levels.
Coupé: Trims available in North America for the coupé body style were the VP, DX (up to 2003), EX, HX, LX (EM2), LX Special Edition or EX Special Edition, and Si. The Coupé was no longer available in Japan, but was still marketed in Europe.
Sedan: Trims available in the sedan body style were the DX, EX, GX, LX, LX Special Edition, EX Special Edition, Hybrid (ES1/2, EN2, ES1, respectively), and Si. EX trim includes sunroof. The LX or EX Special Edition included a six-disc changer and rear spoiler, ABS, larger 15-inch wheels, and a more powerful engine (see below). There was also the EX Special Edition which added a sunroof and rear single cup holder. The Hybrid was the only trim available for the sedan style in Europe.
Different models were available for the Canadian market:
Up until 2003 there were DX and LX models for both sedan and coupé, with the coupé additionally having the Si trim, largely equivalent to the US market EX coupé.
In 2002, Honda Canada, in recognition of the one millionth sale of the Civic in Canada, introduced a limited edition version of the Civic called the Civic Coupe Si Veloz ('Veloz' meaning 'swift' in Spanish). The Veloz edition adds a front, rear, and side skirts, rear spoiler, carbon fiber trim pieces, chrome exhaust finisher, custom Veloz embroidered floor mats and Veloz badges.
In 2003, a 30th Anniversary Edition was added to all models, as well as a Sport model for sedans. In 2004, the DX model was replaced by a Special Edition (SE) model and the previous Sport model was replaced by a LX-g trim.
Si.
The EP3 Civic Si was badged SiR in Canada. Unlike other generations of the Civic Si, this Si was not produced in Canada or the United States, and it does not share a body style or interior with the USDM Civic (offered only in sedan and coupé forms) sold there. Instead, the 2002-05 Civic Si is manufactured in Swindon, England, and exported to Canada and the United States. The Si was the only trim available for the hatchback style in Canada and the United States.
The Civic Si returned to form as a hatchback, after having been sold only as a coupé in the previous generation. The body shape of this model was based on the "New Bullet-Form" concept, which aimed to create a more dynamic look and provide greater stability while traveling on highways or winding country roads. The interior layout also distinguished itself from other Civic Si generations with a dash-mounted shifter. The EP hatchback is also used for the second generation Civic Type R which was sold in Europe and Japan.
Shifting away from the B-series engine, the seventh generation Civic Si adopted the K-series K20A3 engine used in the Acura RSX base model rated at at 6500 rpm and at 5000 rpm. With a redline of 6,800 rpm, the Si distanced itself from the narrow, high-rpm powerband engine of its predecessor, and as a result saw a 20 percent increase in torque. Performance was relatively underwhelming compared to the competition; the switch to MacPherson struts from double-wishbone suspension resulted in less responsive handling, and a near- increase in weight to contributed to slower acceleration than the lighter '99-'00 Si. Much of the weight gain is attributed to the chassis' stouter structure when compared to the previous generation hatchback, with the '02 Si boasting an increase in torsional rigidity by 95 percent and a bending rigidity increase of 22 percent.
With the increased chassis rigidity compensating for weight gain, the 5th-generation Civic Si saw roughly the same performance numbers as the previous generation Si, with 7.6 seconds to 60 mph and 15.9 seconds at the quarter mile, which were comparable to that of Ford SVT Focus and Hyundai Tiburon GT V6. Other factors adversely impacting performance included the lack of an LSD (limited slip differential) and having to shift into third gear to get to 60. First gear ends at about 30, second ends at 55, and third ends at .
The 2004–05 models received minor revisions. Cosmetic changes included revised headlight (dual bulb setup) and taillight designs, standard side skirts, and an option for a HFP. The suspension was updated with a change from 4 lug to 5 lug bolt pattern, a larger rear sway bar, and a change from 15-inch wheels (195/60-15) to 16-inch wheels (205/55-16). The interior received more silver accents in place of the chrome ones (the lock switch).
2003 Honda Civic Si Concept (2002).
For the 2002 SEMA show, Honda unveiled the 2003 Civic Si Concept, which showcased the aftermarket versatility of the Si.
Powertrain/chassis modifications included a GReddy T518Z turbocharger with an integral wastegate, a prototype GReddy front-mounted intercooler kit with aluminum piping, a GReddy Airinx high-flow intake system, a GReddy e-manage engine control manager, a GReddy Profec E-01 electronic boost controller (with e-manage programmer), widened track, Factory Performance sport suspension, a center mounted high-flow exhaust system, and a four-piston Brembo brake system.
The exterior saw changes including a Rally-inspired body kit, 18-inch polished titanium skin torpedo, a carbon fiber grill, front intake and rear bumper diffuser, a black chrome-finish headlights and smoked taillights, high-mounted two-stage rear wing. For the interior, Honda included Mugen carbon fiber and Kevlar race seats covered in red Alcantara suede with 6-point racing harness, a sport 3-spoke steering wheel, aluminum pedals and shift knob, Mugen high performance LCD screen gauge package, center mounted information display.
Engines.
Most DX and LX models had the "D17A1". The HX had the "D17A6" and the EX had the "D17A2". The Si(EP3) had the "K20A3". The JDM 5-door hatchback (EU) had the D15B. The GX runs on CNG.
The Philippine and Middle East version of the 7th generation Honda Civic used the 3-stage VTEC mechanism for their VTi/VTi-S/RS Civics, equipped with a "D16W9" rated with .
So, Japan RS model is D17A. Factbook.
In Europe the Civic was sold also with a common-rail diesel engine produced by Isuzu Motors Polska. This engine is a 1.7L 4EE2 Circle L engine with .
The seventh generation North American Civic DX/LX/Value Package engines were the last in the Honda and Acura not to use Honda's variable valve time system aka (VTEC) along with the 1996-2004 Acura 3.5RL Non-Vtec engines.
U.S. sales.
In 2004, Honda Civic was the seventh best selling vehicle overall and third best selling passenger car in the U.S.
2010 recall.
On August 9, 2010, Honda recalled approximately 117,000 Civic of 2003 model year sold in the U.S. and Canada regarding possible problem with the ignition interlock system due to damage or worn during use, allowing the ignition key to be removed when the auto transmission of the car is not shifted to 'Park' position.

Make A Difference

Make A Difference(MAD) is a platform that empowers youth to take responsibility. To provide children at risk a positive learning ecosystem that will help them unleash their potential.
MAD volunteers implement projects that provide these children with the skills that guarantee employment, role models they can relate to and exposure that helps them dream big.
Currently, around 2100 Make A Difference volunteers teach close to 5200 children in the Indian cities of Cochin, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai, Vellore, Bangalore, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur, Dehradun, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Mysore
Origins.
On an unexpected visit to a center home in Kerala, MAD's founders, who were college students then, were exposed to the inequalities in education. Children at shelter homes were bright and had aspirations, they realized, but did not have quite the means to succeed at reaching their aspirations.
The founders went back to the same center, YMCA Boys' Home Thrikkakara, and set up a library early in 2006, which marked the unofficial beginnings of Make A Difference.
The official registration for the organization was completed on November 1, 2006.
Vision.
Even the most vulnerable children in the society are able to realize Equitable outcomes
"Most Vulnerable":
Children who do not have a family to support them, children who's family is unable to provide a safe space to grow up in.
"Equitable Outcomes": 
Organizational Structure.
MAD is organized and managed at 3 different levels.
City-level operations are led, and managed, by a team of 'Fellows' who are part of MAD's Leadership Development programme. Fellows are part-time employees who may be in college or be working full-time elsewhere.
MAD is divided broadly into four regions geographically, and each region is composed of a Regional Team, most of whom have had previous experience in MAD as Fellows or volunteers. The Regional level provides support to the cities in terms of operational bandwidth.
The top-level consists of full-time employees that MAD recruits to develop strategy for programmes and support functions. Hiring is mostly done in-house from Fellows or Regional level teams.
Funding.
Make A Difference receives funding from 3 primary avenues:
Expansion.
MAD was initially operational in the city of Cochin, with 30 volunteers, reaching out to about 130 children in 2006. Since then, MAD has grown exponentially to establish chapters and operations pan-India.
Approach.
MAD works on the model of empowering communities to take care of their own. MAD provides models that are implementable by youth in a community to address the needs of the vulnerable children of the very same community.

Constance of Hungary

Constance of Hungary (c. 1180 – 6 December 1240) was the second Queen consort of Ottokar I of Bohemia.
Family.
Constance was a daughter of Béla III of Hungary and his first wife Agnes of Antioch. Her older siblings included Emeric, King of Hungary, Margaret of Hungary and Andrew II of Hungary. Two other siblings, Solomon and Stephen, are mentioned in the "" (1878) by Detlev Schwennicke. They reportedly died young.
Her paternal grandparents were Géza II of Hungary and Euphrosyne of Kiev. Her maternal grandparents were Raynald of Châtillon and Constance of Antioch (joint princes of Antioch).
Marriage and children.
In 1199, Ottokar I divorced his first wife, Adelheid of Meissen, on grounds of consanguinity. He married Constance later in the same year. They had nine children.
Constance is regularly noted as a co-donator with her husband in various documents of his reign. Her petitions to her husband for various donations are also recorded. She is considered to have sold the city Boleráz to her nephew Béla IV of Hungary. In 1247, Béla conferred said city to the nuns of Trnava. An epistle by which Constance supposedly grants freedom to the cities of Břeclav and Olomouc is considered a false document. The same epistle grants lands in Ostrovany to the monastery of St. Stephen of Hradište. Another epistle has Constance settling "honorable Teutonic men" (viros honestos Theutunicos) in the city of Hodonín and is also considered a forgery. On 15 January 1230, Ottokar I died and their son Wenceslaus succeeded him. Constance survived her husband by a decade.
In 1231, Pope Gregory IX set Constance and her dowry possessions under the protection of the Holy See. His letter to Constance clarifies said possessions to include the provinces of Břeclav (Brecyzlaviensem), Pribyslavice (Pribizlavensem), Dolni Kunice (Conowizensem), Godens (Godeninensem), Bzenec (Bisenzensem) and Budějovice (Budegewizensem). In 1232, Constance founded Cloister Tichnowitz and retired to it as a nun. She died within the Cloister.

Mood and tempo is determined by using the appropriate Sony compatible software which analyzes music tracks individually and computes the relevant track information. Analyzed tracks can then be plotted onto an intuitive dual axis map through which the music library on the device can be navigated, and playlists can be generated based on relative speed and mood. The horizontal axis is based on mood and the vertical axis is based on tempo.
PlayStation Portable.
SensMe was made available on the PlayStation Portable as of system software version 6.10. It can be downloaded via the XMB or by using a computer. The application features twelve channels by which music is categorized. These include Favorites, Newly Added, Dance, Extreme, Lounge, Emotional, Mellow, Upbeat, Relax, Energetic, Morning/Day/Night/Midnight, and Shuffle All.

CD-ROM

A CD-ROM is a pre-pressed compact disc which contains data. The name is an acronym which stands for "Compact Disc Read-Only Memory". Computers can read CD-ROMs, but cannot write on the CD-ROM's which are not writable or erasable.
Until the mid-2000s, CD-ROMs were popularly used to distribute software for computers and video game consoles. Some CDs, called enhanced CDs, hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a CD player, while data (such as software or digital video) is only usable on a computer (such as ISO 9660 format PC CD-ROMs).
The "Yellow Book" is the technical standard that defines the format of CD-ROMs. One of a set of color-bound books that contain the technical specifications for all CD formats, the "Yellow Book", created by Sony and Philips in 1988, was the first extension of Compact Disc Digital Audio. It adapted the format to hold any form of data.
CD-ROM discs.
Media.
CD-ROMs are identical in appearance to audio CDs, and data are stored and retrieved in a very similar manner (only differing from audio CDs in the standards used to store the data). Discs are made from a 1.2 mm thick disc of polycarbonate plastic, with a thin layer of aluminium to make a reflective surface. The most common size of CD-ROM is 120 mm in diameter, though the smaller Mini CD standard with an 80 mm diameter, as well as numerous non-standard sizes and shapes (e.g., business card-sized media) are also available.
Data is stored on the disc as a series of microscopic indentations. A laser is shone onto the reflective surface of the disc to read the pattern of pits and lands ("pits", with the gaps between them referred to as "lands"). Because the depth of the pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the wavelength of the laser light used to read the disc, the reflected beam's phase is shifted in relation to the incoming beam, causing destructive interference and reducing the reflected beam's intensity. This pattern of changing intensity of the reflected beam is converted into binary data.
Standard.
Several formats are used for data stored on compact discs, known as the Rainbow Books. The "Yellow Book", published in 1988, defines the specifications for CD-ROMs, standardized in 1989 as the ISO/IEC 10149 / ECMA-130 standard. The CD-ROM standard builds on top of the original Red Book CD-DA standard for CD audio. Other standards, such as the "White Book" for Video CDs, further define formats based on the CD-ROM specifications. The "Yellow Book" itself is not freely available, but the standards with the corresponding content can be downloaded for free from ISO or ECMA.
There are several separate standards that define how to structure data files on a CD-ROM. ISO 9660 defines the standard file system for a CD-ROM. ISO 13490 is an improvement on this standard which adds support for non-sequential write-once and re-writeable discs such as CD-R and CD-RW, as well as multiple sessions. The ISO 13346 standard was designed to address most of the shortcomings of ISO 9660, and a subset of it evolved into the UDF format, which was adopted for DVDs. The bootable CD specification, to make a CD emulate a hard disk or floppy disk, is called El Torito.
CD-ROM format.
Data stored on CD-ROMs follows the standard CD data encoding techniques described in the "Red Book" specification (originally defined for audio CD only). This includes cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding (CIRC), eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM), and the use of pits and lands for coding the bits into the physical surface of the CD.
The data structures used to group data on a CD-ROM are also derived from the "Red Book". Like audio CDs (CD-DA), a CD-ROM "sector" contains 2,352 bytes of user data, divided into 98 24-byte frames. Unlike audio CDs, the data stored in these sectors corresponds to any type of digital data, not audio samples encoded according to the audio CD specification. In order to structure, address and protect this data, the CD-ROM standard further defines two sector modes, Mode 1 and Mode 2, which describe two different layouts for the data inside a sector. A track (a group of sectors) inside a CD-ROM only contains sectors in the same mode, but if multiple tracks are present in a CD-ROM, each track can have its sectors in a different mode from the rest of the tracks. They can also coexist with audio CD tracks as well, which is the case of mixed mode CDs.
Both Mode 1 and 2 sectors use the first 16 bytes for header information, but differ in the remaining 2,336 bytes due to the use of error correction bytes. Unlike an audio CD, a CD-ROM cannot rely on error concealment by interpolation, and therefore requires a higher reliability of the retrieved data. In order to achieve improved error correction and detection, a CD-ROM adds a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code for error detection, a and a third layer of Reed–Solomon error correction using a Reed-Solomon Product-like Code (RSPC). Mode 1, used mostly for digital data, contains 288 bytes per sector for error detection and correction, leaving 2,048 bytes per sector available for data. Mode 2, which is more appropriate for image or video data, contains no error detection or correction bytes, having therefore 2,336 available data bytes per sector. Note that both modes, like audio CDs, still benefit from the lower layers of error correction at the frame level.
Before being stored on a disc with the techniques described above, each CD-ROM sector is scrambled to prevent some problematic patterns from showing up. These scrambled sectors then follow the same encoding process described in the "Red Book" in order to be finally stored on a CD.
The following table shows a comparison of the structure of sectors in CD-DA and CD-ROMs:
The net byte rate of a Mode-1 CD-ROM, based on comparison to CD-DA audio standards, is 44,100 Hz × 16 bits/sample × 2 channels × 2,048 / 2,352 / 8 = 153.6 kB/s = 150 KiB/s. This value, 150 KiB/s, is defined as "1× speed". Therefore, for Mode 1 CD-ROMs, a 1× CD-ROM drive reads 150/2 = 75 consecutive sectors per second.
The playing time of a standard CD is 74 minutes, or 4,440 seconds, contained in 333,000 blocks or sectors. Therefore, the net capacity of a Mode-1 CD-ROM is 682 MB or, equivalently, 650 MiB. For 80 minute CDs, the capacity is 737 MB (703 MiB).
CD-ROM XA extension.
"CD-ROM XA" is an extension of the "Yellow Book" standard for CD-ROMs that combines compressed audio, video and computer data, allowing all to be accessed simultaneously. It was intended as a bridge between CD-ROM and CD-i (Green Book) and was published by Sony and Philips in 1991. "XA" stands for eXtended Architecture.
CD-ROM XA defines two new sector layouts, called Mode 2 Form 1 and Mode 2 Form 2 (which are different from the original Mode 2). XA Mode 2 Form 1 is similar to the Mode 1 structure described above, and can interleave with XA Mode 2 Form 2 sectors; it is used for data. XA Mode 2 Form 2 has 2,324 bytes of user data, and is similar to the standard Mode 2 but with error detection bytes added (though no error correction). It can interleave with XA Mode 2 Form 1 sectors, and it is used for audio/video data. Video CDs, Super Video CDs, Photo CDs, Enhanced Music CDs and CD-i use these sector modes.
The following table shows a comparison of the structure of sectors in CD-ROM XA modes:
Disc images.
When a disc image of a CD-ROM is created, this can be done in either "raw" mode (extracting 2,352 bytes per sector, independent of the internal structure), or obtaining only the sector's useful data (2,048/2,336/2,352/2,324 bytes depending on the CD-ROM mode). The file size of a disc image created in raw mode is "always" a multiple of 2,352 bytes (the size of a block). Disc image formats that store raw CD-ROM sectors include CCD/IMG, CUE/BIN, and MDS/MDF. The size of a disc image created from the data in the sectors will depend on the type of sectors it is using. For example, if a CD-ROM mode 1 image is created by extracting only each sector's data, its size will be a multiple of 2,048; this is usually the case for ISO disc images.
On a 74 minute CD-R, it is possible to fit larger disc images using raw mode, up to 333,000 × 2,352 = 783,216,000 bytes (~747 MiB). This is the upper limit for raw images created on a 74 min or ~650 MiB "Red Book" CD. The 14.8% increase is due to the discarding of error correction data.
Manufacture.
Pre-pressed CD-ROMs are mass-produced by a process of stamping where a glass master disc is created and used to make "stampers", which are in turn used to manufacture multiple copies of the final disc with the pits already present. Recordable (CD-R) and rewritable (CD-RW) discs are manufactured by a different method, whereby the data are recorded on them by a laser changing the properties of a dye or phase transition material in a process that is often referred to as "burning".
Capacity.
CD-ROM capacities are normally expressed with binary prefixes, subtracting the space used for error correction data. A standard 120 mm, "700 MB" CD-ROM can actually hold about 737 MB (703 MiB) of data with error correction (or 847 MB total). In comparison, a single-layer DVD-ROM can hold 4.7 GB of error-protected data, more than 6 CD-ROMs.
CD-ROM drives.
CD-ROM discs are read using CD-ROM drives. A CD-ROM drive may be connected to the computer via an IDE (ATA), SCSI, SATA, FireWire, or USB interface or a proprietary interface, such as the Panasonic CD interface. Virtually all modern CD-ROM drives can also play audio CDs (as well as Video CDs and other data standards) when used in conjunction with the right software.
Laser and optics.
CD-ROM drives employ a near-infrared 780 nm laser diode. The laser beam is directed onto the disc via an opto-electronic tracking module, which then detects whether the beam has been reflected or scattered.
Transfer rates.
CD-ROM drives are rated with a speed factor relative to music CDs. If a CD-ROM is read at the same rotational speed as an audio CD, the data transfer rate is 150 KiB/s, commonly referred to as "1×". At this data rate, the track moves along under the laser spot at about 1.2 m/s. To maintain this linear velocity as the optical head moves to different positions, the angular velocity is varied from 500 rpm at the inner edge to 200 rpm at the outer edge. The 1× speed rating for CD-ROM (150 KiB/s) is different from the 1× speed rating for DVDs (1.32 MiB/s).
By increasing the speed at which the disc is spun, data can be transferred at greater rates. For example, a CD-ROM drive that can read at 8× speed spins the disc at 1600 to 4000 rpm, giving a linear velocity of 9.6 m/s and a transfer rate of 1200 KiB/s. Above 12× speed most drives read at Constant angular velocity (CAV, constant rpm) so that the motor is not made to change from one speed to another as the head seeks from place to place on the disc. In CAV mode the "×" number denotes the transfer rate at the outer edge of the disc, where it is a maximum.
20× was thought to be the maximum speed due to mechanical constraints until Samsung Electronics introduced the SCR-3230, a 32x CD-ROM drive which uses a ball bearing system to balance the spinning disc in the drive to reduce vibration and noise. As of 2004, the fastest transfer rate commonly available is about 52× or 10,400 rpm and 7.62 MiB/s. Higher spin speeds are limited by the strength of the polycarbonate plastic of which the discs are made. At 52×, the linear velocity of the outermost part of the disk is around 65 m/s. However, improvements can still be obtained by the use of multiple laser pickups as demonstrated by the Kenwood TrueX 72× which uses seven laser beams and a rotation speed of approximately 10×.
Faster 12× drives were common beginning in early 1997. Above 12× speed, there are problems with vibration and heat. CAV drives give speeds up to 30× at the outer edge of the disc with the same rotational speed as a standard constant linear velocity (CLV) 12×, or 32× with a slight increase. However due to the nature of CAV (linear speed at the inner edge is still only 12×, increasing smoothly in-between) the actual throughput increase is less than 30/12: in fact, roughly 20× average for a completely full disc, and even less for a partially filled one.
Problems with vibration, owing to limits on achievable symmetry and strength in mass-produced media, mean that CD-ROM drive speeds have not massively increased since the late 1990s. Over 10 years later, commonly available drives vary between 24× (slimline and portable units, 10× spin speed) and 52× (typically CD- and read-only units, 21× spin speed), all using CAV to achieve their claimed "max" speeds, with 32× through 48× most common. Even so, these speeds can cause poor reading (drive error correction having become very sophisticated in response) and even shattering of poorly made or physically damaged media, with small cracks rapidly growing into catastrophic breakages when centripetally stressed at 10,000–13,000 rpm (i.e. 40–52× CAV). High rotational speeds also produce undesirable noise from disc vibration, rushing air and the spindle motor itself. Most 21st-century drives allow forced low speed modes (by use of small utility programs) for the sake of safety, accurate reading or silence, and will automatically fall back if a large number of sequential read errors and retries are encountered.
Other methods of improving read speed were trialled such as using multiple optical beams, increasing throughput up to 72× with a 10× spin speed, but along with other technologies like 90~99 minute recordable media and "double density" recorders, their utility was nullified by the introduction of consumer DVD-ROM drives capable of consistent 36× CD-ROM speeds (4× DVD) or higher. Additionally, with a 700 MB CD-ROM fully readable in under 2½ minutes at 52× CAV, increases in actual data transfer rate are decreasingly influential on overall effective drive speed when taken into consideration with other factors such as loading/unloading, media recognition, spin up/down and random seek times, making for much decreased returns on development investment. A similar stratification effect has since been seen in DVD development where maximum speed has stabilised at 16× CAV (with exceptional cases between 18× and 22×) and capacity at 4.3 and 8.5 GiB (single and dual layer), with higher speed and capacity needs instead being catered to by Blu-ray drives.
CD-Recordable drives are often sold with three different speed ratings, one speed for write-once operations, one for re-write operations, and one for read-only operations. The speeds are typically listed in that order; i.e. a 12×/10×/32× CD drive can, CPU and media permitting, write to CD-R discs at 12× speed (1.76 MiB/s), write to CD-RW discs at 10× speed (1.46 MiB/s), and read from CDs at 32× speed (4.69 MiB/s).
Copyright issues.
Software distributors, and in particular distributors of computer games, often make use of various copy protection schemes to prevent software running from any media besides the original CD-ROMs. This differs somewhat from audio CD protection in that it is usually implemented in both the media and the software itself. The CD-ROM itself may contain "weak" sectors to make copying the disc more difficult, and additional data that may be difficult or impossible to copy to a CD-R or disc image, but which the software checks for each time it is run to ensure an original disc and not an unauthorized copy is present in the computer's CD-ROM drive.
Manufacturers of CD writers (CD-R or CD-RW) are encouraged by the music industry to ensure that every drive they produce has a unique identifier, which will be encoded by the drive on every disc that it records: the RID or Recorder Identification Code. This is a counterpart to the Source Identification Code (SID), an eight character code beginning with "IFPI" that is usually stamped on discs produced by CD recording plants.
