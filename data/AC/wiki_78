Military policy

Military policy (also called defence policy or defense policy) is public policy dealing with international security and the military. It comprises the measures and initiatives that governments do or do not take in relation to decision-making and strategic goals, such as when and how to commit national armed forces.
It is used to ensure retention of independence in national development, and alleviation of hardships imposed from hostile and aggressive external actors. The Defence Ministry (or a synonymous organisation) minister is the primary decision-maker for the national military policy.
Purpose.
Military policy identifies threats of hostility and aggression based on intelligence analysis, and defines military scope of national security, defence alliances, combat readiness, military organisation of national forces and their use of military technology.
The national military policy defines the national defence strategy, the "when" of committing national armed forces. The national military policy also defines the strategic posture, the "how", towards any possible threats to national territory, its society, environment, and economy, and defines options available to deal with such threats. The more options a military policy provides to the government, the better it is considered in its formulation. Strategic posture in turn defines the military doctrine of the armed forces. This doctrine may include confronting threats to national interests located outside of the national territory such as shipping lanes. The defence strategy and military doctrine are developed though strategic policy and capability development processes.
Development.
A military policy is created through the military policy process of making important organisational decisions, including the identification of priorities and different alternatives such as defence personnel and technology programs or budget priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have on the overall national development. Defence policies can be understood as political, management, financial, administrative and executable mechanisms arranged to reach explicit military goals and objectives.
Applications.
Military policy addresses the achievement of its military goals and objectives by making explicit statements about the desired capability in: combat readiness, military organization, political-military relationships (civilian control of the military), the role of the armed forces, command and control, military intelligence and counterintelligence, defence diplomacy, defence capability in terms of (technology, mobility, materiel, and logistics), block obsolescence, professionalism and training, recruiting, social change in the military, standing forces, military reserve forces, and conscriptions.
Military policy differs from rules of engagement determine when, where, and how military force is be used by formations and units.

Hooghly Collegiate School

Hooghly Collegiate School or HCS, established in 1812, is one of the oldest and prestigious school in the Hooghly district of West Bengal, India. Every member of this institute takes pride in its glorious history of 200 years.
History.
HCS's early provenance is sketchily documented in "Karuņāsāgar Vidyāsāgar", quoting from 'Education Committee' reports, periodicals and other print media of that period. The name of the school too had changed once or twice, till it came to be known as 'Hooghly College', and thence 'Hooghly Collegiate School' when the college wing was created. The location had undergone some changes too (details and authentication needed). The so-called 'new building' (to the "Ṣāṇḍeśvar Talā" end of the prayer ground, to house the laboratories and the classes IX to XI of the new Higher Secondary scheme)and the box-like, stand-alone crafts-cum-smithy building were completed in 1956-57. The oldest building of the school and part of the adjoining Mohsin College were Hazi Mohammad Mohsin's personal property. It was rumoured to have a subterranean passage, purpose unknown, from below the main staircase of the old building to a ghat on river "Bhāgīrathī" on the lower terrace of the prayer ground (which had two walled terraces); part of the tunnel had collapsed on its own and the school authority saw it fit to seal off the school-side entrance some time in the middle-fifties of the last century."

Hawazin

Ha'wa zin was a sub-division from the Qais Ailan tribe, a pre-Islamic Arabian tribe concentrated in the area around Ta’if in the Arabian Peninsula. Its descendants are scattered across the Middle-East and North Africa as many of its members were dispatched after the Muslim conquests to Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Morocco, and Spain but live mainly as the Sunni muslims of Syria. The remaining descendants in Arabia go by the name of 'Utaybah. Genealogists trace the tribe to Adnan bin Moudir. The descendants of Adnan (also known as the Adnanites) are part of the northern tribes of Arabia. Historians trace the tribe roots to the following bloodline:
Hawazin bin Mansour bin Ekrama bin Khafsa bin Qais Ailan bin Moudir bin Nizar bin Ma'ad bin Adnan ibn Add ibn Send ibn Napyot (Nebaioth) ibn Ishmael ibn Abraham ibn Azar (Terah) ibn Nahoor ibn Srooj ibn Ra'o ibn Phaleg ibn Aber ibn Shaleh ibn Arpheckshad ibn Sam (Shem) ibn Noah ibn Lamek ibn Motoshaleh ibn Edres (Enoch) ibn Yared ibn Mehlaiel ibn Qenan ibn Anosh ibn Sheeth ibn Adam.
The tribes cited under this bloodline are sometimes referred to as Ishmaelites.

Irish Republican Liberation Army

The Irish Republican Liberation Army (IRLA) is an Irish paramilitary "self-styled vigilante group" in support of a united Ireland. Although much of its origins are as yet unknown, the IRLA had attracted attention with its threats of paramilitary action.
Origins.
The IRLA is centred on Belfast in the Ardoyne area. The Irish News suggested that its membership were from a County Antrim family with Loyalist Volunteer Force connections, while others have suggested they splintered from the Continuity IRA (CIRA). Another theory was that the groups was supposed to have started in 2006 by dissidents from CIRA who split to form either the IRLA or the Continuity Liberation Movement.
Threats.
Following the deaths of two of its members in squabbles over firearms in November 2007, Ed Burns and Joe Jones, the former who was shot near the GAA St Galls' club in West Belfast and the latter who was beaten to death with a shovel in Ardoyne, the group threatened retribution against Republican Sinn Féin, the alleged political wing of the CIRA, believed responsible for the deaths. Veteran west Belfast activist, Geraldine Taylor, a candidate in the Assembly elections, and a north Belfast Republican Sinn Féin member, were told by police that their lives were in danger. The threat was said to have come from the apparently "self-styled vigilante group," the IRLA. Further to this, two other republicans were also warned of the danger to their lives.
In November 2007, the group also claimed responsibility for the shotgun attack that wounded a police officer driving away from his son's school in Derry.
The Independent Monitoring Commission said the IRLA has a small arms collection, though its threat is not "terrorist in nature."
In the twentieth IMC report, the IRLA was set to be a "essentially a group of criminals taking a republican banner in order to give supposed status to their activities." Although the group committed at least one other shooting it was not recognised as immediately threatening.
Government response.
On March 5, 2008, East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Tony McNulty if he would consider prohibiting the Irish Republican Liberation Army under the Terrorism Act 2000. McNulty replied that "As a matter of normal policy and practice we do not comment on organisations not on the proscribed list."

Union Giesserei Königsberg

Union Giesserei (German: Union Gießerei) was a German engineering company based in Königsberg, East Prussia.
History.
The families of Laubmeyer, Dultz and Schnell founded an iron foundry in Königsberg on 1 May 1828, that was given the name of Union Giesserei in 1845. On 1 April 1846 Johann Gottfried Dietrich Wilhelm Ostendorff (5 April 1812 - 23 September 1876) took over the running of Union Giesserei, and the manufacture of steam engines and boilers was started. On 5 December 1855, Union-Giesserei celebrated the delivery of its first steam locomotive, built for the Prussian Eastern Railway. On Ostendorff's death in 1876, Elias Radok (16 November 1840 - 30 March 1910), who had previously worked for A. Borsig in Berlin, took over the firm. It was changed from a public trading company to a public limited company on 2 June 1881. The board was now run by E. Radok and Ostendorff's son, Arthur, (18 May 1850 - 24 July 1891). When Elias Radok died, the factory was taken over by senior engineers, Georg Panck and Paul Fischer, together with the master builder, Max Hartung. Paul Fischer left in 1920 due to illness, Georg Panck died in 1923 and Max Hartung took over the helm until the arrival of Dr. Paul Brehm in November 1925.
Union Giesserei did not get any contracts from the newly formed Deutsche Reichsbahn and negotiations with the Reichsbahn proved largely fruitless. This led to severe economic problems in the company during the mid-1920s. In 1927, however, Union Giesserei was finally given orders for the construction of the DRG Class 64 and 80 steam locomotives as part of the 'eastern regions aid' ("Ostlandhilfe") scheme. From 17 March 1930 it became a subsidiary of the F. Schichau GmbH, which took over Union Giesserei completely in 1931.

Jamaican Prime Ministers Medal of Appreciation

The Jamaican Prime Ministers Medal of Appreciation is an award presented by the Prime Minister of Jamaica to those individuals whom he feels are worthy to be recognized for services to Jamaica or to those Jamaicans who have excelled in personal achievements outside of Jamaica.
It is not part of the Jamaican National Honours system. Most recipients will not advance into the Honours system, but a few have been appointed into the Honours system.
History.
Jamaica received its independence from the United Kingdom, changing its status from a British Crown colony to an independent country in the Commonwealth, on 6 August 1962. In 1983, The Right Honorable Edwards Seaga, Prime Minister of Jamaica, felt that, during the twenty-first "coming of age" anniversary of independence, a special recognition should be given to Jamaican citizens who had made significant contributions to the Nation, but who had not received any of the National Honours. A committee was formed of prominent Jamaicans to select recipients with the following criteria:
The Prime Minister determined that 1,000 medals would be presented.
Mr. F. A. Douce, the Secretary General of the Orders, Chancery of the Orders of the Societies of Honours, Office of the Prime Minister in Kingston, Jamaica, was commissioned with the design of the Medal.
Presentations.
The first 1,000 presentations were awarded at the Historic Town Square in Spanish Town, Jamaica on Sunday, 18 December 1983. Prime Minister Seaga personally presented the first 10 medals to the County Custos. The Custodes then presented the Medals to those in their County who had been selected for the award.
The following areas of service were recognized for the awards:
Since that Sunday, the succeeding Prime Ministers have reserved the privilege of awarding the medal to those Jamaicans who distinguished themselves, usually in the International arena. Recipients who were personally awarded the medal by the Prime Minister included three Champion Boxers, Michael McCallum (3 June 1986), Lloyd Honeyghan (10 November 1985) and Trevor Berbick (10 April 1986). Nine other prominent Jamaican was awarded the medal, including Jamaican born actress Marge Sinclair (12 March 1987). 
In 1986, the supply of medals became scarce. It was recommended by the Prime Minister that a new design for the Medal be found to more accurately reflect the current presentations. Again, Mr. F. A. Douce, the Secretary General of the Orders, was tasked with the design and production of a new Medal.
The first Medal presentation of the new design was given by Jamaican Prime Minister The Right Honorable Michael Norman Manley on 27 April 1989 to Russell Ralph Fritz, a Major in The Salvation Army. It was awarded to Fritz for "Social and Welfare Services Particularly the Handicapped and the Aged" to the people of Jamaica. This was the first time that Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley had awarded the Medal. This was also the first time that a non-Jamaican was awarded the Medal, as Russell Fritz is a native Californian, but his wife Jacqueline was a Jamaican Citizen. At the time of the Medal presentation, Fritz was assigned by the International Salvation Army to the Caribbean Territorial Headquarters stationed in Kingston, Jamaica. Fritz had also been the Principal of the School for the Blind and Visually Handicapped in Kingston. Fritz had written a number of articles on Jamaica that were published in international magazines and had also produced three Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation television series.
Design.
The medal is round, 2 inches in diameter, made of nickel and plated with 24-carat gold. It is attached to a ribbon by a small ring, through which larger ring is attached directly to the ribbon. The statutes state that it can be worn either around the neck or on the left breast. However, all medals are presented, for both men and women, with a neck ribbon only.
The obverses for both the first and second design are the same. The field has a Jamaican flag. Encircling the inside rim are the words "The National Flag of Jamaica," with a small pineapple at the bottom separating the wording.
The reverse of the first design has the Prime Ministers flag in the field with the inscription "Prime Ministers Standard" directly below the flag. Encircling the inside rim are the words "Prime Ministers Medal of Appreciation 1962-6th August-1983."
The reverse of the second design is close to the first design. It has the Prime Ministers flag in the field with the inscription "Prime Ministers Standard" directly below the flag. Encircling the inside rim are the words "Prime Ministers Medal of Appreciation." Replacing the 21st anniversary dates is a raised plate at the bottom where the date of issuance is to be stamped.

Victor Garcia (director)

Victor Garcia (1934–1982), was an Argentine award-winning theatre director.
He directed a production of Jean Genet's "The Balcony" at the Ruth Escobar Theatre in São Paulo in 1969, which Genet saw in July 1970. The production was staged under the new regime of Brazil's military dictator General Garrastazu Médici; the actress who played Chantal, Nilda Maria, was arrested for anti-government activities and her children were sent to Public Welfare, prompting Genet to petition the wife of the city's governor for their release. In Garcia's production, the audience observed the action from vertiginous balconies overlooking a pierced 65' plastic and steel tunnel; the actors performed on platforms within the tunnel, or clinging to its sides, or on the metal ladders that led from one platform to another, creating the impression of animals driven insane within the cages of a zoo. The aim, Garcia explained, was to make the public feel as though it was suspended in a void, with "nothing in front of it nor behind it, only precipices." It won 13 critics' awards in the country and ran for 20 months. 
He won the 1973 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director and the Award for Outstanding Set Design for his production of Federico García Lorca's "Yerma".

Mongol conquest of the Jin Dynasty

The Mongol conquest of the Jin Dynasty () lasted over 23 years and the Jin Dynasty finally fell in 1234, the year that the Mongol Empire had claimed the total conquest of the Jin Dynasty, thus completing their control of the whole area of northern China.
Background.
The Jin collected tribute from some of the steppe tribes and encouraged rivalries amongst them. When the Mongols were unified under Khabul Khan in the 12th century, the Jin encouraged the Tatars to destroy them, but the Mongols were able to drive the Jin forces out of their territory. The Tatars eventually captured Khabul's successor Ambaghai Khan and handed him over to the Jurchen court, who nailed him to a wooden mule. The Jin forces conducted regular punitive expeditions against the nomads, either enslaving or killing them.
In 1210, a delegation arrived at the court of Genghis Khan (r.1206-27) to proclaim the ascension of a new Jin Emperor to the Jurchen throne and demanded the submission of the Mongols as a vassal state. Because the Jurchens defeated the powerful steppe nomads and allied with the Keraits and the Tatars, they claimed sovereignty over all the tribes of the steppe. High court officials of the Jin deserted to the Mongols and urged Genghis Khan to attack the Jin Dynasty. The biographer of Genghis, Jack Weatherford, describes the Mongol efficacy: "The second unique characteristic of the Mongol army was that it traveled without a commissary of cumbersome supply train other than its large reserve of horses that always accompanied the soldiers." But fearful of a trap or some other nefarious scheme, Genghis Khan refused. Upon receiving the order to demonstrate submission, Genghis is reported to have turned to the south and spat on the ground; then he mounted his horse, and rode toward the north, leaving the stunned envoy choking in his dust. His defiance of the Jin envoys was tantamount to a declaration of war between the Mongols and the Jurchens. 
After Genghis Khan returned to Kherlen River, in the spring of 1211, he summoned a kurultai. By organizing a long discussion, everyone in the community was included in the process. Genghis prayed privately on a nearby mountain. He removed his hat and belt, bowed down before the Eternal Sky, and recounted the generations of grievances his people held against the Jin and detailed the torture and murder of his ancestors. He explained that he had not sought this war against the Jurchens. At the dawn on the fourth day, Genghis emerged with the verdict: "The Eternal Blue Sky has promised us victory and vengeance".
Emperor Weishaowang of Jin, angry on hearing how Genghis Khan behaved, sent the message to Genghis that "Our Empire is like the sea; yours is but a handful of sand...How can we fear from you?".
Mongol conquest under Genghis Khan.
When the conquest of Tangut started, there were multiple raids between 1207-1209. When the Mongols invaded Jin territory in 1211, Ala 'Qush, the chief of the Ongut, supported Genghis Khan and showed him a safe road to the heart of Jin. The first important battle between the Mongol Empire and the Jin Dynasty was the Battle of the Badger Mouth, a mountain pass in Zhangjiakou, which took place in 1211. There the Jin commander made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, he sent a messenger to the Mongol side, Ming-Tan, who promptly defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At this engagement, fought at Badger Pass, the Mongols massacred thousands of Jin troops. Mongols learned at an early age to always fight on the move. They would pass through towns to draw their opponent away from their animals. When they fell for the Mongol army's trap, the Mongols would kill them and take their animals. While Genghis headed southward, his general Jebe travelled even further east into Manchuria and captured Mukden (Shenyang). However, Genghis Khan was wounded by an arrow in his knee in 1212 after the Mongols returned from their relaxation in the borderlands between grass and Gobi. The Khitan leader Liu-ke had declared his allegiance to Genghis in 1212 and freed Manchuria from the Jin.
When the Mongol army besieged Zhongdu (Beijing) in 1213, Li Ying, Li Xiong and a few other Jin generals assembled a militia of more than 10,000 men who inflicted several defeats on the Mongols. The Mongols smashed the Jin armies, each numbering in the hundreds of thousands, and broke through Juyongguan Pass and Zijingkou Gap by November 1213. From 1213 through spring 1214, the Mongols pillaged the entire North China plain. In 1214, Genghis Khan surrounded the court of the Golden Khan in Zhongdu, China. The Jin general Heishilie Hushahu had murdered the emperor Wanyan Yongji and enthroned his nephew Wanyang Xun. When the Mongols besieged the capital, Zhongdu and the Jin temporarily agreed to become tributary of the Mongols, presenting a Jin princess to Genghis Khan. But when the Mongols withdrew in 1214, believing the war was over after being given a large tribute by the Jin, Li Ying wanted to ambush them on the way with his forces (which had grown to several tens of thousands). However, the Jin emperor Aizong (Wanyan Shouxu) was afraid of offending the Mongols again and stopped him. The emperor and Shuhu Gaoqi then decided to shift the capital south to Kaifeng, above the objections of many courtiers including Li Ying. From then on, the Jin were strictly on the defensive and Zhongdu fell to the Mongols in 1215. By 1215, under Mongol pressure, the Jin were forced to move their capital south from Beijing to Kaifeng, where the Mongols extinguished the Jin dynasty in 1234.
After the shift of the Jin capital to Kaifeng, Prime Minister Wanyan Chenghui and General Moran Jinzhong were left to guard Zhongdu. At this point, one of the Jin armies defected to the Mongols and launched an attack on Zhongdu from the south, taking the Lugou Bridge. Genghis Khan then dispatched his troops to attack Zhongdu again, led by the surrendered Khitan generals Shimo Ming'an, Yelu Ahai, and the Tuhua brothers. Moran Jingzhong's second-in-command, Pucha Qijin, surrendered to the Mongols with all the troops under him, throwing Zhongdu into crisis. The Jin emperor then sent reinforcements north: Yongxi leading the troops from Zhending and Zhongshan (numbers not given), and Wugulun Qingshou leading 18,000 Imperial Guards, 11,000 infantry and cavalry from the southwestern route, and 10,000 soldiers from Hebei, with Li Ying in charge of the supply train. Zhongdu fell to the Mongols on May 31, 1215. Then they systematically rooted out all resistance in Shanxi, Hebei and Shangdong from 1217-23. Fortunately for the Jin Dynasty, Genghis turned his attention to another event in Central Asia and Persia.
When Shuhu Gaoqi was in control of the imperial court in 1217, he foolishly decided to invade the Southern Song for the first time in nearly 30 years. This war lasted until 1224 and was a total failure for the Jin. In 1219, Botohuitarhun, a women chief took one of Genghis Khan's Mongol troop captive and sent one of his trusted general, with help of a small group of well knowledgeable soldiers to find out what happened. In 1224, the Wanyan Shouxu declared that the Jin would never again invade the Song. But the damage had already been done - the Jin forces had been split between north and south at a critical stage in the war with the Mongols when Zhongdu, Hebei and Shandong had fallen and Shanxi was being attacked. Many Khitan mercenaries left the Jurchen armies and joined Genghis Khan.
Muhuali's advance.
In 1223, the Mongol general Mukhulai (Muqali) had struck into Shaanxi, attacking Chang'an when Chingis was campaigning in Khorazm. The garrison in Chang'an, 200,000 under Wanyan Heda, was too strong and Muhuali had to turn to besieging Fengxian with 100,000 men. The siege dragged on for months and the Mongols were harassed by local militia, while Jin reinforcements were about to arrive. Muhuali then died of illness, and the Mongols retreated. This was the siege in which the Xi Xia troops supporting the Mongols gave up and went home, incurring the wrath of Genghis Khan. In the wars against the Mongols, therefore, the Jin relied heavily on subjects or allies like the Uighurs, Tanguts and Khitans to supply cavalry.
Mongol conquest under Ögedei Khan.
When Ögedei ascended the throne, he rebuffed Jin offers of peace talks. The Jin officers murdered Mongol envoys. The Kheshig commander Doqolqu was dispatched to attempt a frontal attack on Tongguan Pass, but Wanyan Heda defeated him and forced Subutai to withdraw in 1230. In 1231, the Mongols attacked again and finally took Fengxiang. The Jin garrison in Chang'an panicked and abandoned the city, pulling back to Henan with all the city's population. One month later, the Mongols decided to use a three-pronged attack to converge on Kaifeng from north, east and west. The western force under Tolui would start from Fengxiang, enter the Tong Pass, and then pass through Song territory at the Han River (near Xiangyang) to reemerge south of Kaifeng to catch the Jin by surprise.
The Chinese used fire arrows against the Mongols during the defence of Kaifeng in 1232. The Mongols later adopted this weapon in later conquests.
In 1233, after Wanyan Shouxu (the Jin emperor Aizong) had abandoned Kaifeng and failed to raise a new army for himself in Hebei, he returned to Henan and established his base in Gui'de (present-day Anyang). Scattered Jin armies began to gather at Gui'de from the surrounding region and Hebei, and the supplies in the city could no longer feed all these soldiers. Thus Wanyan Shouxu left only 450 Han Chinese troops (Zhongxiao Jun) under Commander in Chief Pucha Guannu and 280 men under Commander Ma Yong to guard the city, and dispersed the rest of the troops to forage in Su (in Anhui), Xu (modern Xuzhou in Jiangsu), and Chen (modern Huaiyang in Henan).
Pucha Guannu then launched a coup with his troops, killing Ma Yong and more than 300 other courtiers, as well as about 3,000 officers, palace guards and civilians who refused to cooperate with him. He made the emperor his puppet and became the real master of the imperial court. At this point the Mongols had arrived outside Gui'de and were preparing to besiege the city. The Mongol general Sajisibuhua had set up camp north of the city, on the bank of a river. Guannu then led his 450 troops out on boats from the southern gate at night, armed with fire-lances (huoqiang). They rowed along the river by the eastern side of the city, reaching the Mongol camp early in the morning. Wanyan Shouxu watched the battle from the northern gate of the city, with his imperial boat prepared for him to flee to Xuzhou if the Jin troops were defeated.
The Jin troops assaulted the Mongol camp from two directions, using their fire-lances to throw the Mongols into a panic. More than 3,500 Mongols drowned in the river while trying to flee, and the Mongol stockades were all burned to the ground. Sajisibuhua was also killed in the battle. Guannu had achieved a remarkable victory and was promoted by the emperor (who after all was under his control). But Gui'de was not defensible in the long term, and the other courtiers urged the emperor to move to Caizhou, which had stronger walls and more provisions and troops. Pucha Guannu opposed the move, afraid that his power base would be weakened and arguing that Caizhou's advantages had been overstated.
Three months later, Wanyan Shouxu used a plot to assassinate Guannu, and then quickly began preparations to move to Caizhou. By the time new reports reached him that Caizhou was still too weak in defences, troops and supplies, he was already on the way there. The fate of the Jin dynasty was then sealed for good, despite the earlier victory against great odds at Gui'de.
Wanyan Heda learned of this plan and led 200,000 men to intercept Tolui. At Dengzhou, he set an ambush in a valley with several tens of thousands of cavalry hidden behind the crest of either mountain, but Tolui's spies alerted him and he kept his main force with the supply train, sending only a smaller force of light cavalry to skirt around the valley and attack the Jin troops from behind. Wanyan Heda saw that his plan had been foiled and prepared his troops for a Mongol assault. At Mount Yu, southwest of Dengzhou, the two armies met in a pitched battle. The Jin army had an advantage in numbers, and fought fiercely. The Mongols then withdrew from Mount Yu by about 30 li, and Tolui changed his strategy. Leaving a part of his force to keep Wanyan Heda occupied, he sent most of his men to strike northwards at Kaifeng in several dispersed contingents to avoid alerting Heda.
On the way from Dengzhou to Kaifeng, the Mongols easily took county after county, and burned all the supplies they captured so as to cut off Wanyan Heda's supply lines. Heda was forced to withdraw, and ran into the Mongols at Three-peaked Hill in Junzhou. At this point, the Jin troops on the Yellow River were also diverted southwards to meet Tolui's attack, and the Mongol northern force under Khan Ögodei seized this opportunity to cross the frozen river and join up with Tolui - even at this point, their combined strength was only about 50,000. By 1232 the Jin Emperor was besieged in his capital of Kaifeng. They together smashed the Jin forces. Ögedei soon departed, leaving the final conquest to his generals.
The fall of the Jin Dynasty.
Wanyan Heda's Jin army still had more than 100,000 men after the battle at Mount Yu, and the Mongols adopted a strategy of exhausting the enemy. The Jin troops had little rest all the way from Dengzhou, and had not eaten for three days because of the severing of their supply lines. Their morale was plummeting and their commanders were losing confidence. When they reached Three-peaked Hill, a snowstorm suddenly broke out, and it was so cold that the faces of the Jin troops went as white as corpses, and they could hardly march. Rather than attack them when they were desperate with their backs to the wall, the Mongols left them an escape route and then ambushed them when they let down their guard during the retreat. The Jin army collapsed without a fight, and the Mongols pursued the fleeing Jin troops relentlessly. Wanyan Heda was killed, and most of his commanders also lost their lives. After the Battle of Three-peaked Hill, Kaifeng was doomed and the Jin emperor soon abandoned the city and entered Hebei in a vain attempt to reestablish himself there. Thousands of people—offered a stubborn resistance to the Mongols, who entrusted the conduct of the attack to Subutai, the most daring of all their commanders. The Jin Emperor was driven south again, and by this time Kaifeng had been taken by the Mongols so he established his new capital at Caizhou (Runan, in Henan). Subutai wished to massacre the whole of the population. But fortunately for the Khitan, Yelü Chucai was more humane, and under his advice Ögedei rejected the cruel proposal.
The Song, wishing to give them the coup de grâce, declared war upon the Jin, and placed a large army in the field under their best general, Mongkong. The remainder of the Jurchen army, under their sovereign Ninkiassu, took shelter in Caizhou, where they were closely besieged by the Mongols on one side and the Song on the other. Driven thus into a corner, the Jins fought with the courage of despair and long held out against the combined efforts of their enemies. At last Ninkiassu saw that the struggle could not be prolonged, and he prepared himself to end his life. When the enemy broke into the city, he heard the stormers at the gate of his palace. Wanyan Shouxu committed suicide, and the Jin dynasty was finally destroyed.
He retired to an upper chamber and set fire to the building. Many of his generals, and even of his soldiers, followed his example, preferring to end their existence rather than to add to the triumph of their Mongol and Song opponents. Thus came to an end in 1234 the famous dynasty of the Jurchens.

Ian Freeland

Lieutenant-General Sir Ian Henry Freeland GBE KCB DSO DL (14 September 1912 – 2 July 1979) was a British Army officer, who most notably served as Army General Officer Commanding and Director of Operations in security matters in Northern Ireland in the aftermath of rioting in 1969, and the beginning of the Troubles.
Army career.
Early career and Second World War.
The son of Major-General Sir Francis Edward Freeland, Freeland was initially educated at Wellington College. Then, after Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Freeland was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Norfolk Regiment on 1 September 1932, and promoted lieutenant on 1 September 1935, and captain on 1 September 1940. At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was regimental adjutant. He then served as Brigade Major for the 7th Infantry Brigade in 1942 and General Staff Officer, Grade 2 at the War Office in 1943 and gained a variety of wartime promotions, culminating in 1944 in temporary promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel and command of the 7th Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment in the fighting in Normandy, and for his leadership he was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 21 December 1944. The citation for this award describes how his battalion was the forward unit of a bridgehead over the River Orne near Grimbosq and over the forty-eight hours of 7 and 8 August 1944 repelled nine German counterattacks (by elements of 271st Volksgrenadier Division and 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend). Despite heavy German fire he constantly moved around the battlefield to encourage his forward companies, and find the moment to launch his own offensive. He later commanded 1/5 Battalion Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) through Belgium, and was awarded the Belgian decorations of Chevalier of the Order of the Crown with Palm and the Croix de Guerre 1940 with Palm, the citation for these awards particularly mentions his command of the battalion during the capture of Ghent, when the battalion was the leading element of the 7th Armoured Division.
Post-war.
Freeland held the temporary rank of colonel and served on the staff of headquarters VIII Corps 1945–46, before becoming second-in-command of 4th Armoured Brigade and further staff duties at HQ British Army on the Rhine in 1946–47. This was followed by duty as Commandant, All Arms Training Centre 1948–1949; staff duty at the War Office 1949-1950; and instructing at the Staff College, Camberley 1951–1953.
While, at the end of the war, he held war substantive rank as a lieutenant-colonel, he was still only a substantive captain and was promoted to substantive major on 1 July 1946, and granted a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel on 1 July 1951. On 15 February 1954 he was promoted substantive lieutenant-colonel, and given command of 2n Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. The battalion served in Cyprus in 1954.
Freeland was promoted to substantive colonel on 2 April 1956 (with seniority from 10 June 1954), and brigadier on 1 January 1960. He served as brigade commander 12th Infantry Brigade from 1956 to 1957, at the Imperial Defence College in 1958, and then returned to the War Office. He was promoted major-general on 18 March 1961 (with seniority from 10 February 1961), and appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) East Anglian District and 54 Infantry Division (T.A.), holding that post until 17 July 1963, by which time it had been renamed GOC 54 (East Anglian) Division District. He was then GOC, East Africa Command from 1 November 1963 until 28 November 1964, by which time the appointment had been renamed GOC, British Land Forces Kenya. This period saw British involvement in the Zanzibar Revolution. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1964 New Year Honours. He then served as Vice-Adjutant-General at the Ministry of Defence from 3 December 1964 until 1 February 1968. He was then appointed Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 1 April 1968 and promoted to lieutenant-general the same day (with seniority from 20 October 1968). He was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KCB) in the 1968 Queen's Birthday Honours. He stepped down as deputy chief of staff on 31 December 1968, as the position was abolished, along with its equivalents in the Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force.
Freeland held the honorary appointment of Deputy Colonel of the Royal Anglian Regiment (successor to the Royal Norfolk Regiment) with specific responsibility for the Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire components of the regiment from 1968, and was appointed Colonel of the Regiment on 4 October 1971, relinquishing the appointment on 1 October 1976.
Northern Ireland.
In the middle of August 1969, the decision was made to reinforce the police in Northern Ireland with army personnel. Freeland had been appointed General Officer Commanding on 9 July 1969, during a relatively peaceful time in the early Troubles, when just 1,000 British troops were stationed there, and was subsequently made Director of Operations in security matters on 28 August. By mid-August, there had been major rioting. Troop levels had reached about 6,000, and Freeland was warning that there was a danger that soldiers would become targets. Initially unionists saw Freeland as being on their side, though this changed when he argued strongly for the abolition of the B Specials. However, support from the nationalist community also waned after the shooting of Daniel O'Hagan on 31 July 1970. He also received criticism for a television interview he gave, in which he said, "that the Army's patience was not inexhaustible, and that force might have to be met by force". He fully expected to be dismissed from his post, but he was supported by the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and the Home Secretary, James Callaghan. By June 1970, troop numbers reached 7,000, largely to meet expected trouble arising from the climax of the "marching season", and the release of Bernadette Devlin from jail. In the event, no major trouble materialised, perhaps thanks to the precautions put in effect. By September 1970 it was reported that Freeland was to step down at his own request, due to its extremely stressful nature. He was succeeded by Vernon Erskine-Crum on 4 February 1971. This proved to be a short-lived appointment as Erskine-Crum suffered a heart-attack soon afterwards and was replaced, in turn, by Lieutenant-General Harry Tuzo on 2 March. Freeland was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1971 Queen's Birthday Honours, and retired from the army on 21 June 1971.
He correctly predicted a "honeymoon period" after British soldiers were placed on patrol on the streets, though he incorrectly predicted that the Peace lines in Belfast were to be temporary.
Retirement.
After his retirement from the army Freeland lived in Dereham, Norfolk. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Norfolk in 1972, and Vice Lieutenant in 1978.

Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall (film)

Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall is a 1924 silent historical drama directed by Marshall Neilan. The film is based upon the 1902 novel "Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall".
Plot.
In the month of May 1550 two great houses were to be united by the betrothal of the son of Rutland and the heiress of Haddon Hall. Sir George Vernon (Anders Randolf) is forfeit to Rutland on his daughter's 18th birthday, for ten of his thirty manors lying adjacent to Rutland. His daughter Dorothy (Mary Pickford) and John Manners (Allan Forrest) are forced to marry each other on their 18th birthday, but they can't stand each other. John is in France with Mary Stuart (Estelle Taylor) and George intents to use this as a way for Dorothy to be able to marry her cousin Malcolm Vernon (Marc McDermott).
On her 18th birthday, Dorothy prepares to marry Malcolm. Malcolm comes over from Scotland for the wedding, while Dorothy has seconds thoughts about marrying someone she has never met. Meanwhile, George is demanded by the Rutland men to forfeit for Dorothy not marrying John. Dorothy is charmed when she meets Malcolm and makes sure to him she has no intention in marrying John. She doesn't know Malcolm really is John and when he reveals himself, she is shocked and insulted. She informs her father, while the real Malcolm shows up as well. Dorothy has to point out John, but fears John will be killed and points out Malcolm. John has the time to run away, while Malcolm is revealed to not be John.
Meanwhile, Mary Stuart is ordered to come to England immediately when her ring is found. John is the one who has to get her from Scotland, but is afraid Queen Elizabeth will find out. Dorothy has secretly fallen in love with John and meets him several times in the forest and at the castle in disguise. Dorothy tells him she wants for them to elope, but John convinces her to wait for the right time. When George catches Dorothy and John together, he is outraged. Malcolm comes in to kill John, but Dorothy stops him and John flees.
Dorothy keeps on seeing John, while her wedding to Malcolm keeps on getting closer. John has just taken Mary into his home for refuge. George has become very wealthy and even invites Queen Elizabeh (Clare Eames) for the wedding. Queen Elizabeth accepts, but orders everyone who assists Mary to be beheaded. Dorothy, meanwhile, feels she is a prisoner in her own home and writes John a letter about wanting to elope with him. George gets his hands on the letter and orders John to be hanged. She attempts to escape, but gets caught and imprisoned.
Dorothy agrees to marry Malcolm if John won't be hanged. She didn't know John was actually never captured and that George lied to trick her into marrying Malcolm. On her wedding day, Dorothy finds out her father lied to her about hanging John and seeks revenge. She orders her maid Jennie (Lottie Pickford) to pursue John to rescue Dorothy. When Jennie arrives at the Rutland Castle, she catches Mary in John's arms and hurries back to Haddon Hall to tell Dorothy the truth. Dorothy is outraged and informs Queen Elizabeth about Mary's whereabouts. Queen Elizabeth announces she will behead the earl of Rutland and John for treason and orders Malcolm and his troops to arrest him. Dorothy immediately feels sorry for John, but isn't able to stop the queen.

Production.
Mary Pickford worked previously with director Ernst Lubitsch on the movie "Rosita" (1923). They were originally to make this picture together as well, but Lubitsch turned the directing assignment down. Pickford admitting wanting to work with someone else as well.
Pickford desperately wanted for this film to be a success. She used a big budget and introduced several special effects. She assigned Marshall Neilan as the director. They had positive memories of working together on previous films, including "Stella Maris" (1918) and "Daddy-Long-Legs" (1919). However, they reportedly fought together a lot while working on this film. Neilan showed up on set drunk every day. Their longtime friendship was eventually destroyed.

Robert J. Shea

Robert J. Shea (born June 1, 1968) was the Associate Director for the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for Administration and Government Performance. He has held important positions in the U.S. Legislative Branch and in the Executive Office of the President of the United States, where he worked to improve the performance and operations of the U.S. Government. He managed OMB's internal affairs and led the President's Performance Improvement Initiative, an integral component of George W. Bush's President's Management Agenda. Additionally, Robert administered the award-winning Program Assessment Rating Tool and ExpectMore.gov, advised on government human capital policy, and led interagency collaborations in the areas of food safety and implementation of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act. 
He now leads the Communications, Public Policy, and Performance Management teams at Grant Thornton's Global Public Sector Practice.
Education and career.
A graduate of Connecticut College and South Texas College of Law, Robert was a Professional Staff Member with the House Committee on Government Reform from 1995 through 1996. There he had responsibility for examining the economy and efficiency of government programs, and acted as liaison with the government’s Inspectors General. In 1997, Robert worked as Legislative Director for Congressman Pete Sessions (TX), where he organized the Results Caucus, a group of Members of Congress dedicated to results-based management and solving many of the government’s major management problems. In early 1999, Robert was named Counsel to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs where, in addition to general oversight of Executive Branch management, he was charged with oversight of the implementation of the statutory framework for performance-based government, including the Government Performance and Results Act and the Chief Financial Officers Act.It was while with the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that Robert led efforts to tabulate and reduce the government's improper payments. The subject of numerous laws and a major Presidential Initiative, U.S. government agencies now report making more than $100B in improper payments annually. In 2002, Shea joined the U.S. Office of Management and Budget where he was appointed to lead the President's Improper Payments Initiative. He enjoyed increasingly greater responsibility leading the President's Budget and Performance Integration Initiative. He administered the Program Assessment rating Tool (PART), recognized by the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation with an Innovations in American Government Award. Associate Director for Administration and Government Performance in 2007, Shea led implementation of the landmark Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act, which required all Federal financial transactions to be reported ona single website, USASpending.gov. Shea was one of the longest serving political staffers at OMB during the Bush Administration, serving almost all eight years of the term. 
In response to the Federal Computer Week article "Robert Shea to leave OMB", Robert wrote: 
I'll be leaving OMB in September, and it's hard. It's been the honor of a lifetime working at OMB and with agencies to improve the results achieved for the American people. I'll get to do that in my next stage, but it won't feel like I'm having as much an impact as I did these last several years. Though you might not know it reading the paper and watching the news, the Federal government is accomplishing amazing things for the American people every day. I hope I contributed my small part, but it's nothing compared to the contributions made by Clay Johnson, Jim Nussle, Karen Evans, and all of the dedicated, hard working, and, most importantly, results oriented people at OMB. I'm proud of what we achieved. I'll miss it a lot.
Family and hobbies.
Robert is a native of Houston, Texas, and now lives in Alexandria, Virginia with his wife and their three daughters, Haley, Hannah, and Mimi. 
His wife, Eva Cahalan Shea, was inducted to the Connecticut College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999 for soccer and lacrosse and is also the Wilton, CT High School Hall of Fame. She is currently a member of Alexandria Lacrosse Commission.

Barbara Gluck

Barbara Gluck (born 1938) is an American photojournalist, art photographer, speaker, writer, and healing facilitator.
After an early career in advertising she spent almost four years in Vietnam, during the war, and produced award-winning photojournalism during the Vietnam War. During the late 1970s she developed her career as an art photographer, with her "Light Painting" series becoming major museum shows.
In the early 1980s she co-founded the Light Institute of Galisteo, in New Mexico, which became famous for its "Past Life" work. In the late 1980s Gluck went on to found the Global Light Network and the Soul Matrix Clearing, Healing and Empowerment System, which focused on releasing "The Primordial Imprints of Separation from God". She has taken this around the world.
Biography.
Gluck was born in New York, the daughter of Hungarian immigrants. Her father worked as a diamond setter. She graduated from NYU with a major in communication arts and a minor in journalism, entering a career in advertising with McCann Erickson and later Benton & Bowles, before the president of the Young & Rubicam agency hired her as a Special Advisor. Her career as a photojournalist began in earnest during the Vietnam War. She was based in Saigon 1968/69 and 1972/73, working mostly for "The New York Times". In 1976 she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and began her work as an art photographer, with a major exhibit "The Stream" opening at The Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe in 1979. She continued her photojournalism as well. During the 1970s she lectured, co-produced the first New Mexico Film and Photography Festival in Santa Fe's Armory for the Arts, and served (in 1978-79) as a Public Relations and Media Consultant to the Navajo Nation - during the Navajo Hopi Land Dispute Commission. She currently resides in Santa Monica, California.
Vietnam photography.
Gluck was one of numerous female photographers to cover the Vietnam War. During these detachments she both flew with the US military on a B-52 bombing mission and visited Viet Cong troops, whom she photographed for the cover of the "New York Times". Mark Edward Harris, in art photography periodical "B+W magazine", said "Barbara Gluck's photos have been called 'the Cartier-Bressons of the Vietnam Ward', and rightly so." In spring 2005, to mark the 30th anniversary of the war's end, the Vietnamese government invited her to participate as a keynote speaker at a "Conference of Reunion and Reconciliation" for contemporary Vietnamese journalists and for foreign journalists who had covered the war. She was also invited to speak at another conference, on "The Role of Journalism in the Development of Vietnam." During the visit she photographed images for a forthcoming book, "Vietnam: Then and Now", commissioned to include both her black and white images from the 1970s and new images in color. In early 2005, the J.P. Getty Museum in Los Angeles purchased a portfolio of her vintage Vietnam prints for their permanent collection, and included one of her photographs in the exhibit “Pictures for The Press”, representing 35 images of historic events between 1940 and the 1970s.
Naturopathic practice.
In 1984 Gluck co-founded The Light Institute of Galisteo, New Mexico, an organization she later left to found a new company, The Global Light Network. She developed a healing process called the Soul Matrix Clearing, Healing and Empowerment Process which she has since taught around the world.
Awards.
Gluck received the 1973 World Press Photo Foundation award for Outstanding News Photo of the Year, and a Poynter Fellowship at Yale University for Excellence in Journalism in 1974.

Steven R. Wilf is a Professor of Law at the University of Connecticut School of Law. He is an expert on intellectual property law, historical jurisprudence, and legal history.
Professor Wilf was born in Philadelphia, and earned his J.D. from Yale Law School and his Ph.D. from the Yale Department of History in 1995. He also received a B.S. from Arizona State University. He has been a visiting professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and DADD guest professor at the Free University of Berlin. He also has held fellowships as John Carter Brown Fellow at Brown University, Fellow in Comparative Legal History at the University of Chicago, Golieb Fellow at the New York University School of Law, and at The Institute for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem. In 2010-2011, he was a Microsoft/LAPA Fellow in Law, Property, and the Economic Organization of Society at the Princeton Program in Law and Public Affairs. In 2011-2012, he was a Lemelson Fellow at the Smithsonian Institute. Prior to coming to Connecticut, where he was one of the founders of the Intellectual Property Program, Professor Wilf was a law clerk for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and taught at Chicago-Kent College of Law.
In Intellectual Property law, where he has written on trade secret, trademark, copyright, and patent laws, his work has focus ed largely on the role of culture in shaping doctrinal legal rules. More recently, he has written on the history of Intellectual Property law. As in other areas of his legal historical work, he has identified the contingent elements of historical development, and seeks to unpack alternative normative outcomes.
Professor Wilf's earlier scholarship examined the late eighteenth-century emergence of a rich vernacular legal language in the area of criminal law, which was intimately connected to American patriot agitation against the British in the course of the American Revolution. He has argued that America's later legal development should be rooted in this formative period rather than in court-based interpretation of the United States Constitution. He addressed the question of how to understand law before a law giving moment in his book, "The Law Before the Law".
From his eighteenth-century American scholarship, his study of how pre-Sinai Jewish law was interpreted across two millennia of thinking about the law before the Torah, and his essays on nineteenth-century historical jurisprudence, he is best known for advocating a legal history of the imagination, arguing that legal historians should look at how law was envisioned in all its possibilities, even fanciful constructions of normative principles, rather than simply limit themselves to positive law created by legislatures or courts.

Marcus Aurelius Scaurus

Marcus Aurelius Scaurus (died 105 BC) was a Roman politician and general during the Cimbrian War. After one of the consul designates was prosecuted and condemned, Scaurus was made consul suffectus in 108 BC. 
In 105 BC he went as a senior legate with the consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus to Gaul to battle the Cimbric invasion. Scaurus was ordered to construct a cavalry camp around 30 miles north of the consular camp. The Battle of Arausio was begun by the Cimbri and Teutones advancing on the cavalry camp, which provided little resistance. The Roman force was completely overwhelmed and the legate was captured and brought before the Cimbrian leader Boiorix. Scaurus was not humbled by his capture and advised Boiorix to turn back before his people were destroyed by the Roman forces. The king of the Cimbri was indignant at this impudence and had Scaurus executed by being slowly roasted alive in a wicker cage. Throughout the ordeal, Scaurus behaved with impeccable Roman dignity, neither crying out nor writhing.

Wentbridge

Wentbridge is a small village in the Benefice of the Went Valley and Parish of Darrington, West Yorkshire, England.
Geography.
The village used to be on the A1, which section of road is now the B6474, which also leads eventually to South Elmsall. The village is less than a mile from the boundary with North Yorkshire to the east, with the boundary following the A1 from the River Went to Barnsdale Bar, where this is the southernmost point of North Yorkshire. Close by to the south-west is the Roman Ridge Roman road (A639). To the north is Darrington.
History.
Wentbridge is mentioned in what may be the earliest Robin Hood ballad, Robin Hood and the Potter: "Y mete hem bot at Went breg,' syde Lyttyl John"
A plaque on the bridge commemorates Robin Hood. Opposite the bridge, on the north side of the river is Jackson's Lane where a noticeboard directs travellers up to the church.
The village is named because it used to be the Great North Road's bridge over the River Went. Entrance to the village was down a steep valley which would have been a problem before motorised transport and later was a bottleneck. The village pub is the "Blue Bell Inn" on "Great North Road". The village Church is dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and welcomes couples for weddings and wedding blessings. The vicar is the Rev Adrian Judd. There is a church service every Sunday and Christmas Day, except for the 5th Sunday of the month. It is very convenient for receptions at the Wentbridge House Hotel and Rogerthorpe Manor.
Wentbridge Viaduct.
To avoid the incline on the valley, when the village was bypassed at a cost of £800,000 in 1961, one of the largest viaducts in Europe (at that time) was built to cross the Went valley at a height of 30 m using prestressed concrete. It is 92 m long and was designed by FA (Joe) Sims, and became a Grade II listed building on 29 May 1998. It received an award thirty years after its construction from the Concrete Society.

<doc id="19025882" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19025882" title="Perspectives on the abduction phenomenon">
Perspectives on the abduction phenomenon

Various perspectives on the abduction phenomenon have formed in order to explain the fantastical claims some have made of being forcibly taken and often examined by apparently otherworldly beings. The prime differences between these perspectives lie in how much credence is to be ascribed to the claims themselves. Perspectives range from the assertion that all abductions are hoaxes to the literal belief that the claims are happening objectively and separately from the consciousness of the claimants. 
The mainstream scientific perspective is that the abduction phenomenon has its roots in human psychology, neurology and culture. That is, it is effectively a psychosocial phenomenon rather than actual cases of alien abduction. However, many among the general public, conspiracy theorists, and ufologists hold to the idea that actual extraterrestrials have been temporarily abducting people against their will.
The Extraterrestrial Hypothesis.
This is the theory that alien abduction is a literal phenomenon: extraterrestrials kidnap humans in order to conduct studies or experiments on them and the reason we have not discovered them is that their technology is so advanced that they are able to evade detection. However, this account is not widely supported by most mainstream scientists due to the complete lack of physical evidence and the contradictory nature of most abduction accounts. For example, many accounts involve being abducted from crowded cities without attracting any attention, and no supposed alien implants have ever been discovered despite physical examinations of the abductees.
Skeptical Perspectives.
Skeptical perspectives on the abduction phenomenon assert that supposed occurrences of people being kidnapped and subjected to forced medical examinations by non-human creatures do not occur literally as reported. These perspectives tend to be the ones most widely accepted by mainstream scientists. Alternative explanations, such as the extraterrestrial hypothesis, are dismissed by many academics as being pseudoscientific.
Various hypotheses have been proposed by skeptics to explain reports without the need to invoke non-parsimonious concepts such as intelligent extraterrestrial life forms, though the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life forms is by no means marginal to the current scientific consensus. These hypotheses usually center around known psychological processes that can produce subjective experiences similar to those reported in abduction claims. Skeptics are also likely to critically examine abduction claims for evidence of hoaxing or influence from popular culture sources such as science fiction.
Hoaxes.
Many skeptics believe alien abductees to be outright lying about their abduction experiences. The main motivators for such hoaxes are believed to be financial gain from books or films that may be made about their experiences, and psychosocial factors, such as attention from others and the possibility of fame or other such opportunities they would not otherwise have. However, most abductees do not go public with their stories and so it is believed that the majority of them genuinely believe in their abduction experiences. In this sense, simple fabrication is not a sufficient explanation for the majority of abduction claims.
Psychopathology.
A common view among the general public (and, in the past, by the scientific community) is that those who believe they have been abducted by aliens must be mentally ill. This view, however, has very little support from scientists and academics as most studies have found alleged abductees to be no more likely than the general population to suffer form psychopathologies.
Nevertheless, abductees do differ from the general public in a few other, significant ways. For example, abductees often score higher than average people on hypnotic suggestibility, absorption, magical ideation and dissociative experiences. Put simply, these measures mean abductees are more likely to accept suggestions of a hypnotist as true, they are prone to becoming fully engrossed in their imaginations and fantasies, they are more likely to believe in unusual phenomena, and they experience more alterations in consciousness (such as ‘spacing out’).
False Memory Hypothesis.
This is one of the most widely accepted theories in the scientific community. It involves a thorough explanation, using psychological theory and research, of how psychologically healthy individuals may come to believe that they have been abducted and how they maintain that belief. It involves several different steps or series of events, though not all steps are required to lead to a false memory of abduction.
Sleep Paralysis.
The vast majority of abduction experiences are thought to originate from an episode of sleep paralysis. In short, this is when one awakens from REM sleep and becomes aware of the full body paralysis that occurs during REM sleep. Sleep paralysis is often accompanied by a feeling of a heavy weight pressing down upon ones chest, as well as hypnopompic hallucinations. These typically include the feeling of flying or levitating, flashing lights, feeling a presence in ones bedroom, and hallucinations of figures (such as a person or an animal) near ones bed. The content of these hallucinations tends to be strongly influenced by the individuals cultural beliefs. For example, in the past such hallucinations were interpreted as attacks by incubus and succubus demons, whereas in Newfoundland a witch-like creature is most commonly hallucinated. In "The Demon-Haunted World", astronomer Carl Sagan pointed out that the alien abduction experience is remarkably similar to tales of demon abduction common throughout history: "...most of the central elements of the alien abduction account are present, including sexually obsessive non-humans who live in the sky, walk through walls, communicate telepathically, and perform breeding experiments on the human species" (Sagan 1996 124).
The events experienced during sleep paralysis are often unusual and terrifying, but most people dismiss them as being a minor sleep disorder. Others, however, are convinced that the event was so unusual and unpleasant that the explanation must be equally as unusual and unpleasant, and so they search for such an explanation.
Recall With Hypnosis.
Hypnosis is frequently used by abduction researchers to help recover memories of so-called missing time periods, and has been done so since the Betty and Barney Hill abduction. In their search for an explanation for the unusual event they have experienced, many people seek out the help of professionals. It has been found that individuals who already have an interest in UFOs are extremely likely to end up seeking the help of therapists with similar views or beliefs to their own. This particular therapist-patient combination is exceptionally likely to result in the creation of false memories of alien abduction, particularly under the use of hypnosis. Hypnosis has been shown to increase the number of recollections a person has, but this applies to both real and false recollections. This is due to the drastically increased suggestibility of hypnotised individuals. Abduction researcher and folklorist Thomas Bullard noted that hypnotized subjects become suggestible, "edit their thoughts less rigorously," thus becoming more likely to confabulate, or even opening themselves to the implantation of memories. 
Although the unreliability of memories recovered during hypnosis is now widely agreed upon, not all academics share this view. As Budd Hopkins writes,
" ... the Hill case bears upon one popular theory which has been widely but uncritically accepted by many skeptics: the idea that such accounts must have been implanted by hypnosis, consciously or unconsciously, or by manipulative practitioners who 'believe in' the reality of such events. Simon, who hypnotized the Hills, was avowedly "skeptical" about the reality of the Hills' abduction recollections. Yet the Hills stubbornly held to their interlocking, hypnotically recovered accounts despite Simon's suggestions at the end of treatment that their memories could not be literally true. It can therefore be concluded that the bias of the hypnotist had nothing to do with the content of their hypnotic recall." (emphasis as in original; Hopkins, 218)
When under hypnosis, an individual will attempt to fill in gaps in their memory with any information possible, including fantasies. The information used to fill such gaps can come from both the hypnotist and the individual under hypnosis. For example, the hypnotist may either knowingly or unknowingly use loaded questions that influence the already ambiguous memories of abductees in such a way that the patient creates an alien abduction narrative for them. Skeptics Robert Sheaffer and Phillip J. Klass agree that individual abduction researchers appear to exert influence on the characteristics of narratives retrieved during hypnotic recall. This influence tends to shape recovered abduction narratives in a way that reinforces the preconceived biases of the individual researcher.
The hypnotised subjects existing beliefs may also lead them to create an alien abduction story under hypnosis as hypnotised individuals tend to believe that thoughts, images, or ideas that they have whilst under hypnosis derive from personal experience rather than other sources (such as the therapists suggestions). This can explain the observation by Budd Hopkins mentioned above, that the patients came to believe they were abducted even though their hypnotist was skeptical of the abduction phenomenon. Thomas E. Bullard, while not an abduction skeptic per se, has noted that the presence or absence of hypnosis as a method for memory retrieval in abduction claimants seems to effect descriptions of the abductors themselves. Hypnotically assisted recall is more likely to produce descriptions of the "standard" grey humanoid, while cases where hypnosis was "not" used "include more variety."
As Newman & Baumeister (1996) say, “there is increasing evidence that hypnosis does not simply reveal the UFO abduction phenomenon- it plays a major role in creating it”. Although it is widely accepted that memories of alien abductions are false, they are generally believed wholeheartedly by the individual.
Recall Without Hypnosis.
The vast majority of abduction memories emerge after the use of hypnosis. However, a minority of abductees come about their abduction memories unassisted by this technique. In this case, it is believed that imagination inflation plays a major role in the development of their abduction memories, as it is similar to the “imaginative role-playing” techniques used in hypnosis (Baker, 1992b, as cited by ). The idea of alien abduction may be suggested by an authority figure, such as a therapist. The presence of authority figures and their encouragement and confirmation of the reliability and accuracy of such memories is a key factor in the development of false memories.
Impact of Culture on Abduction Reports.
Although proponents have argued that there is a core narrative consistent across abduction claims, there is also variation in the details of reports across cultures. Skeptics like Robert Sheaffer assert that this variation supports a psycho-social hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of the abduction phenomenon. These cultural factors can influence the memories retrieved both under hypnosis and without the use of hypnosis.
For example, it is believed that many abduction accounts retrieved through hypnosis may be strongly influenced by science-fiction books or movies that subjects have recently encountered. Kottmeyer (1989, as cited by ) pointed out that the famous abduction claims of Betty and Barney Hill bore a striking resemblance to a movie and television show that they had both recently watched. It has also been observed that accounts of alien abductions tend to coincide with wide held beliefs of the time. For example, Hynek (1972, as cited by ) pointed out that until the late 1950s it was still believed that there may be intelligent life on other planets within our solar system, and until the late 1950s abductees reported aliens as coming from Mars, Jupiter, and Venus. Once scientists discovered otherwise, abductees claims changed accordingly. Although, Betty Hill did described star system the visitors were from which at the time was unknown until later in the century.
The biology and attitudes of the abductors are points of drastic divergence between the home countries of different abduction claimants. Robert Sheaffer observes: 
"In North America large-headed gray aliens predominate, while in Britain abduction aliens are usually tall, blond and Nordic, and South America tends toward more bizarre creatures, including hairy monsters."
Sheaffer also sees similarity between the aliens depicted in early science fiction films, in particular, "Invaders From Mars", and those reported to have actually abducted people. Commonalities exist in the appearances, behavior, technology and societies of fictional and allegedly real abductors.
However, not everyone agrees with the idea of abduction claimants being influenced by science fiction sources. In an essay, Bullard writes that "The small showing for monstrous types and the fact that they concentrate in less reliable cases should disappoint skeptics who look for the origin of abductions in the influence of Hollywood. Nothing like the profusion of imaginative screen aliens appears in the abduction literature." Similarly, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard asks, "If Hollywood is responsible for these images, where are the monsters? Where are the robots?" (Bryan, 50).
Maintenance of Abduction Memories.
Some abductees come to recant their stories once faced with opposition or disbelief from others, particularly based on their lack of solid evidence. Most, however, do not. Faced with this dissonance between their confidence that their abduction memory is real and the potential inaccuracy of that memory as suggested by others, many abductees seek out support groups. In these support groups abductees are surrounded by like-minded others who have had similar experiences and, therefore, will confirm the accuracy of the individuals abduction experience.
Parallels with Other "Spurious" Phenomena.
Many parallels have been drawn between the abduction phenomenon and various other unusual events, supporting the idea that abduction memories are created by means other than actual alien abduction. For example:
Paranormal, religious, and conspiratorial perspectives.
There have been a variety of explanations offered for abduction phenomena, ranging from sharply skeptical appraisals to uncritical acceptance of all abductee claims. Others have elected not to try to explain such claims, instead noting similarities to other phenomena, or simply documenting the development of the alien abduction phenomenon.
Imaginal realm hypothesis.
Various authors, for example Jacques Vallée, Graham Hancock and John Mack have suggested that the dichotomy, 'real' versus 'imaginary', may be too simplistic; that a proper understanding of this complex phenomenon may require a reevaluation of our concept of the nature of reality.
"Abductors" as demonic manifestations.
Some have argued that abduction experiences bear striking similarities to pre-20th century accounts of demonic manifestations, noting as many as a dozen similarities.
As evidence of their belief that Alien Abductions are demonic manifestations, researchers have offered various testimonies of aliens reacting to the name of Jesus in much the same way that demons are recorded as having reacted in the New Testament, with some even alleging that the invocation of the name has shown to successfully abort such abductions.
Abduction experiences as a result of government mind control.
In a lengthy article, Martin Cannon makes the admittedly speculative argument that memories of alien abductions might in fact have been created in the "abductees" by a secret government mind control program, such as MKULTRA.
Individual perspectives.
Michael Persinger.
In a long article, Dr. Michael Persinger argues that most of the features of the abduction phenomenon can be explained as the manifestation of measurable functions of the human brain. Persinger writes that the "main theme" of his article "is to explore visitation experiences, now attributed by many people to UFO and implicitly "extraterrestrial' phenomena, from the perspective of modern neuroscience... From an operational perspective, the average visitation experience attributed to an alien entity is indiscriminable from average mystical or religious experience attributed to gods and to spirits. Instead we have been trying to isolate those areas of the brain and those electromagnetic patterns within the brain that are involved with the general visitation experience." (Persinger, 263)
He goes on to argue that "Nearly every basic element of mystical, religious, and visitor experience has been evoked with electrical stimulation" of test subjects' brains. (Persinger, 270). Individuals with some forms of epilepsy often experience vivid hallucination, and Persinger suggests that the same areas of the brain are activated in these individuals as in those who experience extraordinary visitations.
"Most people who report these experiences abduction display average to above average intelligence, are not 'crazy' and are very aware of the social and personal consequences of their experiences upon their families, friends and vocational opportunities." (Persinger, 278)
Persinger relates a specific case of a "thirty-five year old woman" who "reported ... the presence of multiple, elongated humanoids, in shimmering gray-silver clothes, that would surround her bed for a few nights every month." The woman hesitated to tell her regular physician of the encounters, for fear that she'd be seen as "crazy". (Persinger, 278) The woman was prescribed a low dose of "the antiepileptic compound carbamazepine" and after regular use of the medication, the visitations "disappeared". Persinger is quick to note that "This does not indicate that all people who report visitor experiences associated with UFOs are undiagnosed epileptics or that the phenomena will cease when with this particular medication. Instead, it indicated that well-formed and meaningful experiences, attributed to alien sources and sufficient in magnitude to disrupt the person's sense of self and adaptability, can be associated with periods of electrical activity that can be affected by treatments not typically associated with these types of experiences." (Persinger, 278)
He also cites polls indicating that up to one third of people have had some sort of similar experience: 39% of more than 1700 people polled over 20 years have answered "yes" to the question "At least once in my life very late at night, I have felt the presence of another Being." (Persinger, 280). Given that visitor experiences are somewhat common, and that worldwide, they tend to follow the same patterns, Persinger suggests that while underlying neurological factors give the experience its basic form, how such events are interpreted is shaped by cultural factors: "Because human brains are more similar than they are different, the themes of these experiences have been and remain remarkably similar across space and time. The details are simply punctuation from the person's culture." (Persinger, 296)
Persinger's hypothesis ties into another observation that alien abduction is in many regards similar to shamanic initiations.
James McClenon's hypothesis illuminates many similarities between alien abduction stories and the historical accounts of mythological encounters with incubi and succubi, i.e. sleep paralysis, small un-earthly intruders at night, sexual activity/abuse, etc. ... This is an indicator of our predisposition and our willingness to accept these modern day myths, stories, and beliefs.

Thomas Bowman Garvie

Thomas Bowman Garvie (February 6, 1859 - January 5, 1944) was a Northumbrian artist whose portraits include Thomas Burt, Lord Percy, Lord Armstrong, George B Bainbridge, Fred B Fenwick and Sir William and Lady Grey.
He was a prolific painter of portraits and landscapes. He studied in London and Paris completing the Grand Tour in 1898. His work faithfully observed nature: landscapes were painted "plein air" and his portraits and figurative paintings reflect a naturalistic use of light and colour. Despite his orthodox outlook, he was at the time an extremely popular portraitist of the North East and there are several of his paintings in the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle and Cragside (National Trust) in Northumberland.
Biography.
Bowman Garvie was born in Morpeth, Northumberland. He showed an early talent for drawing and was successful in gaining a place to study under Philip Hermogenes Calderon in 1883 obtaining there a scholarship for the Royal Academy where he studied until 1888 when he travelled to Paris to study at the Académie Julian under Fleury and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. For the next ten years he spent long periods painting in France, Italy and Switzerland before returning to Morpeth in 1898 to marry his long standing fiancé Isabella Grey.
Between 1914 and 1922 he held the position of Master of the Pictures at the Pen and Palette Club in Newcastle; a member of the Cullercoats Art Group; President of the North East Coast Art Club in 1937 and a member of the Art Committee, Kings College, Newcastle.

Dan-Air Flight 0034

Dan-Air Flight 0034 was a fatal accident involving a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 series 1 turboprop aircraft operated by Dan-Air Services Limited on an oil industry charter flight from Sumburgh Airport, Shetland Islands, to Aberdeen Airport. 
The crash, which occurred on 31 July 1979 offshore following the aircraft's failure to take off, resulted in the aircraft's destruction and 17 deaths of 47 on board (15 of 44 passengers and both pilots).
The aircraft.
The aircraft, operated by Dan-Air Services Ltd, was a Hawker Siddeley HS 748-105 series 1 (construction/manufacturer's serial number: 1542, registration: G-BEKF) that had its first flight in 1962. It entered service with Aerolíneas Argentinas the same year and was subsequently operated by Argentinian state-owned oil company Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF). It was one of seven Hawker Siddeley HS 748 series 1 aircraft Dan-Air acquired from YPF for oil industry support work in the North Sea in 1977. At the time of the accident it had flown 29,007 hours.
Accident.
G-BEKF was engaged on regular charter flights between Aberdeen and Sumburgh, carrying oil company personnel. The inbound flight to Sumburgh was made without incident and the crew had a seven hour stopover before making the return flight to Aberdeen, Dan-Air 0034, with 44 passengers on board.
When flight 0034 was cleared for takeoff from runway 09 at 15:59 hours, the engines were accelerated while the aircraft was held back by its brakes. The takeoff run commenced at exactly 16:00 hours. Evidence later retrieved from the aircraft's flight data recorder showed that it accelerated normally through the V1 decision speed of , to its V2 takeoff safety speed of . However, no rotation was carried out even though the aircraft significantly exceeded its VR vertical rotation speed of .
About five seconds after reaching the scheduled rotation speed, the aircraft began to decelerate. It then crossed the airport perimeter road and passed over the inclined sea defences, losing its port wing and breaking its fuselage in two in the process. After nose-diving into the sea from the shoreline, the aircraft sank in about one minute in approximately of water. Elizabeth Cowe, the sole flight attendant, was among the 30 survivors. She assisted in the rescue of 26 of the 29 surviving passengers, which earned her an MBE in recognition of her bravery. However, adverse weather conditions hampered rescue attempts mounted by boat and helicopter. This resulted in the remaining 15 passengers' and both pilots' deaths by drowning.
Investigation.
The accident was notified by Sumburgh Air Traffic Control at 17:30 hours on 31 July 1979. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) commenced their investigation the following morning.
The entire wreckage was salvaged and removed for a detailed examination, which needed to take into account the additional damage that had resulted from the action of the sea and the salvage operation. Both engines were stripped down and examined, but no evidence of pre-impact failure was found. The propeller control units were tested and were discovered to perform within specification. No evidence of fire, smoke, or overheating was found.
Although the compass selector was discovered to have been switched to the co-pilot's instrument, it was not established which pilot handled the takeoff (company regulations stated that the commander should perform this if the co-pilot was inexperienced). It was however considered possible that it had been moved during evacuation or salvage.
Cause.
The AAIB investigation concluded that the accident was caused by the locked condition of the aircraft's elevators which prevented the aircraft rotating into a flying attitude. It was thought likely that the elevator gust lock became re-engaged during the pilots' pre-takeoff checks, and that it was not noticed until the takeoff was so far advanced that a successful abandonment within the overrun area could not be made. The re-engagement of the gust lock was made possible by the condition of the gust lock lever gate plate and gate-stop strip, to which non-standard repairs had been made.
Safety recommendations.
The AAIB made nine recommendations:

76th Air Refueling Squadron

The 76th Air Refueling Squadron (76 ARS) is part of the 514th Air Mobility Wing at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. It operates the KC-10 Extender aircraft conducting aerial refueling missions as the reserve associate to the 305th Air Mobility Wing.
History.
Established in early 1943 as a C-47 Skytrain transport squadron under First Air Force, later trained under I Troop Carrier Command in the eastern United States. Deployed to England in late 1943, being assigned to Ninth Air Force in England, IX Troop Carrier Command to participate in the buildup of forces prior to the Allied landings in France during D-Day in June 1944. Began training for participation in the airborne operation over Normandy. Entered combat on D-Day 1944 by dropping paratroops of the 101st Airborne Division near Cherbourg; towed Waco and Horsa gliders carrying reinforcements to that area on the afternoon of D-Day and on the following morning; received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its part in the Normandy invasion.
Began transport services following the landings in France and intermittently engaged in missions of this type until V-E Day; hauled supplies such as serum, blood plasma, radar sets, clothing, rations, and ammunition, and evacuated wounded personnel to Allied hospitals.
Interrupted supply and evacuation missions to train for and participate in three major airborne assaults. A detachment that was sent to Italy in July 1944 for the invasion of Southern France dropped paratroops over the assault area on 15 August and released gliders carrying troops and equipment such as jeeps, guns, and ammunition; flew a resupply mission over France on 16 August; and then transported supplies to bases in Italy before returning to England at the end of the month.
In September 1944 the group participated in the air attack on Holland, dropping paratroops of 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions and releasing gliders carrying reinforcements.
Moved to France in February 1945 for the airborne assault across the Rhine; each aircraft towed two gliders in transporting troops and equipment to the east bank of the Rhine on 24 March; then the group flew resupply missions to Germany in support of ground forces. Transported supplies to occupation forces in Germany and evacuated Allied prisoners of war after V-E Day.
Returned to the US in August Inactivated on 15 November 1945.

USNS Eltanin (T-AK-270)

USNS "Eltanin" (T-AK-270/T-AGOR-8) was an "Eltanin"-class cargo ship with an ice-breaking hull acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1957 and then operated by the Navy in a non-commissioned status, named after Eltanin, the star in constellation Draco. Her designation was changed to that of an oceanographic research ship in 1962 when she operated in Antarctic waters.
Built in Avondale, Louisiana.
"Eltanin" (T-AK-270) was launched on 16 January 1957 by Avondale Marine Ways, Inc., Avondale, Louisiana. She was turned over to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) in October 1957 for operation in a noncommissioned status.
Conversion to research ship.
During 1961 and 1962, "Eltanin" was modified throughout at a New York shipyard to fill a new role as a floating laboratory. Former cargo spaces were replaced with labs, workshops, and staterooms for scientists, and further labs were added above decks. Anti-roll tanks were also added, along with protective bulwarks. On 23 August 1962 her classification was changed to Oceanographic Research Vessel and designated "T-AGOR-8".
Antarctic duty.
"Eltanin", under the direction of the National Science Foundation, and operated by the Military Sea Transportation Service, worked the Antarctic Ocean, becoming the first Antarctic research ship to do so. After two shakedown cruises in the Atlantic Ocean and a positioning cruise with further testing en route, "Eltanin" operated a total of 52 Antarctic research cruises from July 5, 1962 thru December 29, 1972. Over this time, some 80% of the southern ocean was surveyed, and a total of 400,000 miles traveled.
Some of "Eltanin"'s research cruises collected magnetic profiles of the sea floor that proved to be pivotal evidence in the acceptance of the continental drift theory, by proving the existence of sea floor spreading. These key profiles, which show symmetric bands of alternating magnetic orientation (corresponding to magnetic pole reversals) around various undersea ridges, are known by the ship's name and cruise number (ex. "Eltanin-19").
As of mid-1973, "Eltanin" was laid up in San Francisco Bay, her research career at an end.
Inactivation.
"Eltanin" was placed out of service at an unknown date and struck from the Naval Vessel Register, also at an unknown date, and transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. In 1974 she was transferred to the Argentine Navy and renamed "ARA Islas Orcadas". She was later disposed of by the Argentine Navy in 1979.

Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling v. RDR Books

Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. and J. K. Rowling v. RDR Books, 575 F.Supp.2d 513 (SDNY 2008) is a copyright lawsuit brought on 31 October 2007 by the media company Warner Bros. and "Harry Potter" author J. K. Rowling against RDR Books, an independent publishing company based in Muskegon, Michigan. Lawyers for Rowling and Time Warner argued that RDR's attempt to publish for profit a print facsimile of "The Harry Potter Lexicon", a free online guide to the "Harry Potter" fictional universe, constituted an infringement of their copyright and was not protected by the affirmative defense of fair use. The trial was held from 14–17 April 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In September 2008, the court ruled in Rowling's favor, and publication of the book was blocked.
Origins.
In 2000, Steve Vander Ark, a librarian from Grand Rapids, Michigan, created the Harry Potter Lexicon, an online encyclopedia of the Harry Potter book series that collected and reorganized various facts from the novels into a searchable form. The Lexicon, which is non-profit, with only its operations paid for by advertising, quickly became a favorite for fans of the books, including Rowling herself, who claimed on her website that "I have been known to sneak into an internet cafe while out writing and check a fact rather than go into a bookshop and buy a copy of "Harry Potter", which is embarrassing." 
In August 2007, Vander Ark was contacted by Roger Rapoport, President of RDR Books, and asked about the possibility of publishing a for-profit print version of the site. Although Vander Ark had previously claimed he had no interest in doing so, Rapoport assured Vander Ark that such a publication would be legal. To further pacify Vander Ark's concerns, he added an addendum to the contract that stated that RDR Books would act to defend him in any future lawsuits.
Pre-trial.
On 31 October 2007, Warner Bros. and Rowling sued RDR Books to block the book's publication. Rowling, who previously had a good relationship with Vander Ark, reiterated on her website that she plans to write a "Harry Potter" encyclopedia, and that the publication of a similar book before her own would hurt the proceeds of the official encyclopedia, which she plans to give to charity. A judge later barred publication of the book in any form until the case was resolved. In their suit, Rowling's lawyers also asserted that, as the book describes itself as a print facsimile of the Harry Potter Lexicon website, it would publish excerpts from the novels and stills from the films without offering sufficient "transformative" material to be considered a separate work.
On her website, Rowling said, "Despite repeated requests, the publishers have refused to even countenance making any changes to the book to ensure that it does not infringe my rights." On his website, Vander Ark responded, "I have worked diligently with everyone associated with the books to make sure we don’t violate copyright. There have been a number of times when I have talked with Jo's people and held back information they didn’t want published or modified material on the Lexicon to make sure they approve. I got specific permission from Warner Bros. to use film images and the illustrations from the books. I have been just as diligent with the rights of fans who have allowed me to use their writing and artwork. In each case I have listed the copyright owner and made sure that they were credited and that they retained their copyright."
"There have been a huge number of companion books that have been published", said Neil Blair of Rowling's literary agency, Christopher Little, "Ninety-nine percent have come to speak to us. In every case they have made changes to ensure compliance. They fall in line. But these guys refused to contact us. They refused to answer any questions. They refused to show us any details."
RDR Books retained Lizbeth Hasse, from the Creative Industry Law Group in San Francisco, who recommended that RDR Books also retain a New York trial attorney, David Hammer. Ms. Hasse then asked, a group of intellectual property lawyers at Stanford Law School to help defend RDR Books' right to publish. Fair Use Project Executive Director Anthony Falzone said the Lexicon is protected by U.S. law which has long given people "the right to create reference guides that discuss literary works, comment on them and make them more accessible."
On 16 January 2008, Rowling and Warner Bros. filed their full 1,100 page complaint against RDR Books, claiming that the book "compiles and repackages Ms. Rowling's fictional facts derived wholesale from the Harry Potter works without adding any new creativity, commentary, insight, or criticism. Defendant's attempt to cloak the Infringing Book in the mantle of scholarship is merely a ruse designed to circumvent Plaintiffs' rights in order to make a quick buck."
On 25 January 2008, RDR submitted a request to Judge Robert Patterson, United States District Court that Rowling and her publishers hand over to them all potential source material for the planned encyclopaedia, including, "The notes that JKR has made on the seven novels ... Cheryl Klein's novels' continuity editor full index ... Bloomsbury's 'comprehensive bible'" and "The 'further material from Ms. Rowling's creative mind'". Patterson refused, but did grant "statements contained in the publications listed in the plaintiffs' response" to Warner Bros. claims.
In February 2008, Vander Ark, in an interview with the British fan magazine "Ansible", said
The book is not simply a cut and paste of the Lexicon website. The entries on the website provide much more detailed and complete information than the entries in the book. We took the information on the site and did a lot of editing, condensing, and in some cases complete rewriting. We avoided direct quotations whenever we could and clearly cited any quotations that we kept in. In the case of entries from Rowling's own "encyclopedia"-style books, we intentionally left a lot out and urged readers in the introduction to the book to go buy her books for the complete information ... While I was working on the Lexicon book, I received assurances from several copyright and intellectual property experts that the book we were creating was legal. 
Vander Ark dismissed Rowling's claim to copyright:
Part of the problem all along has been the automatic assumption on the part of many that Rowling has the right to completely control anything written about the Harry Potter world. That's quite a huge power grab on her part and from everything I can tell, not legal. You and I are part of a subculture that lives off the creative work of others. We always try to do that in a legal and respectful way. However, if Rowling manages to extend her reach that far into our subculture, she will choke us off very quickly. And if she doesn't, what's to stop the next person from taking this legal precedent to even more dangerous places?
On 8 February 2008, RDR Books published their official memorandum in response to Warner Bros injunction, saying, in part, " appears to claim a monopoly on the right to publish literary reference guides, and other non-academic research, relating to her own fiction. This is a right no court has ever recognized. It has little to recommend it. If accepted, it would dramatically extend the reach of copyright protection, and eliminate an entire genre of literary supplements."
Rowling and Warner Bros. responded on 27 February, saying, "The book consists of 400 pages of material taken from the series. Its 2437 entries use the series' fictional facts, long plot summaries and paraphrased character descriptions, all of which is actionable," and that, "RDR's argument that the book is "transformative" is wrong because . . . the book does not create "new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings." The statement also claimed that Warner Bros "have shown that the book is devoid of analysis, commentary or anything else rising to the level of scholarship," and that, "Of the book's 2437 entries, 2034 simply lift information straight from the series."
Rowling supported the injunction, saying, "I am particularly concerned about RDR's continued insistence that my acceptance of free fan based websites somehow justifies its efforts to publish an unauthorized "Harry Potter" "lexicon" directly contrary to my stated intention to publish my own definitive Harry Potter Encyclopedia," and that, "RDR's position fans could simply buy both books is presumptuous because it assumes that everyone would want to have two "Harry Potter" encyclopedias and insensitive in thinking that everyone who would want to have both could afford to purchase both." She concluded by saying, "I am very frustrated that a former fan has tried to co-opt my work for financial gain. The "Harry Potter" books are full of moral choices and ethical dilemmas, and, ironically, Mr. Vander Ark's actions tend to demonstrate that he is woefully unfit to represent himself as either a "fan of" or "expert on" books whose spirit he seems entirely to have missed."
Trial.
The trial began on 14 April 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, with Rowling testifying on day one and Vander Ark testifying on day two. During her testimony, Rowling reiterated her claim that the Lexicon contained minimal commentary and merely recycled her writing, adding nothing other than "facetious asides and etymologies of the easiest kind." Rowling referred to the "Lexicon" as "wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work", and criticized it as "sloppy" and characterized by "very little research". In sometimes emotional testimony, Rowling recalled beginning the "Potter" books when she was an impoverished 25-year-old single mother, nearly coming to tears when saying, "These characters continue to mean so much to me over a long period of time. The closest you could come is to say, 'How do you feel about your children?'" Rowling also revealed that the lawsuit has "decimated her creative work" over the prior month, causing her to cease work on a new novel. In his testimony, Vander Ark said that he too had had reserves about publishing the encyclopedia and that the publishing company had talked him into it. "It's been difficult because there has been a lot of criticism, obviously, and that was never the intention. ... This has been an important part of my life for the last nine years or so," he said.
Wary of the consequences of a legal ruling, the presiding judge, Robert P. Patterson, Jr., urged the parties to settle, saying, "I’m concerned that this case is more lawyer-driven than it is client-driven. The fair use people are on one side, and a large company is on the other side. . . . The parties ought to see if there’s not a way to work this out, because there are strong issues in this case and it could come out one way or the other. The fair use doctrine is not clear."
The plaintiffs made their closing remarks on the third day of the trial. Rowling claimed that "This case is about an author's right to protect their creation. If this book is allowed to be published the floodgates will open. Are we, or are we not, the owners of our own work? It's not just my work that is endangered." In addition, she claimed that the Lexicon was "sloppy, lazy" and "filled with errors," though RDR Books lawyer Anthony Falzone noted that "Copyright law does not permit an author to suppress a book because she doesn't like it." 
On day three, the two sides reached a limited settlement involving the use of any Rowling endorsements on the book. It was agreed that, should it be published, neither her name nor her previous endorsement of the website would be used to promote it.
Each side employed a literary expert to testify whether or not the Lexicon had copied text without attribution. RDR hired a literature professor from the University of California, Berkeley, who cited reference guides to "The Lord of the Rings" and C.S. Lewis’s "The Chronicles of Narnia" as precedents to the Lexicon's book. David Hammer, lawyer for RDR, claimed that the need for a reference guide was greatest when the work being discussed is most creative, and fantasy is presumably the most creative form of literature.
Ms. Jeri Johnson, senior tutor in English at Exeter College, Oxford, spoke as an expert witness in literature for the plaintiffs, decrying Vander Ark's work as unscholarly, and claiming that there was enough material in Rowling's world for serious academic analysis. Rowling's lawyers said that, unlike those guides, the Lexicon consists largely of information taken from the books and contains little interpretation or analysis. RDR's lawyers agreed, but said that such guides can provide other benefits for the reader than analysis. 
During the trial, Rowling said on the stand, "I never ever once wanted to stop Mr. Vander Ark from doing his own guide, never ever. Do your book, but, please, change it so it does not take as much of my work." However, in an interview with the "Chicago Tribune", RDR Books' publisher, Roger Rappaport, said, "That opportunity was never presented to us. The only thing they said was: 'Will you stop the book?'"
Verdict.
On 8 September 2008, Judge Patterson decided the case in Rowling's favor, claiming that "because the Lexicon appropriates too much of Rowling's creative work for its purposes as a reference guide, a permanent injunction must issue to prevent the possible proliferation of works that do the same and thus deplete the incentive for original authors to create new works." Patterson awarded the plaintiffs $750 for infringement of each of the seven Harry Potter novels and $750 for infringement of each of two official companion books (i.e., "Quidditch Through the Ages" and "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"); the minimum amount possible, "since the Lexicon has not been published and thus plaintiffs have suffered no harm beyond the fact of the infringement." Patterson was careful to draw a distinction between the Lexicon book and other potential guidebooks, saying, "While the Lexicon, in its current state, is not a fair use of the Harry Potter works, reference works that share the Lexicon's purpose of aiding readers of literature generally should be encouraged rather than stifled".
Patterson concluded that, "Because it serves ... reference purposes, rather than the entertainment or aesthetic purposes of the original works, the Lexicon’s use is transformative and does not supplant the objects of the Harry Potter works." However, he also noted that, "The Lexicon’s use of Rowling’s companion books is transformative to a much lesser extent. The content of the companion books takes on the informational purpose of the schoolbooks they represent in the novels. As Vander Ark testified, the companion books are 'essentially encyclopedias already'." 
"The transformative character of the Lexicon is diminished, however, because the Lexicon’s use of the original Harry Potter works is not consistently transformative," Patterson ruled. "The Lexicon’s verbatim copying of ... highly aesthetic expression raises a significant question as to whether it was reasonably necessary for the purpose of creating a useful and complete reference guide."
Patterson rejected Rowling's argument that the book interfered with her plans to write a "Harry Potter" encyclopedia, saying, "the market for reference guides to the Harry Potter works is not exclusively hers to exploit or license, no matter the commercial success attributable to the popularity of the original works."
Reaction.
In a statement released to the media, Rowling responded favorably to the verdict: "I took no pleasure at all in bringing legal action and am delighted that this issue has been resolved favorably. I went to court to uphold the right of authors everywhere to protect their own original work. The court has upheld that right. The proposed book took an enormous amount of my work and added virtually no original commentary of its own. Many books have been published which offer original insights into the world of Harry Potter. The Lexicon just is not one of them." 
The Stanford Law School fair use project, which had represented RDR, said, "We are encouraged by the fact that the Court recognized that as a general matter authors do not have the right to stop the publication of reference guides and companion books about literary works. As for the Lexicon, we are obviously disappointed with the result, and RDR Books is considering all of its options, including an appeal." 
On their website, the group clarified their position: "In a thoughtful and meticulous decision spanning 68 pages, the Court recognized that as a general matter authors do not have the right to stop publication of reference guides and companion books about literary works, and issued an important explanation of why reference guides are not derivative works. Needless to say, we're very happy the Court vindicated these important principles ... The Court held the Lexicon infringed Ms. Rowling's copyright, was not protected by fair use, and permanently enjoined the publication of it. ... Careful and thoughtful as the decision is, we think it's wrong. So stay tuned to see where we go from here."
David Hammer, the lawyer who represented RDR Books, said, "I'm sorry about the result, that the lexicon was not found to be sufficiently transformative, but I am happy the judge endorsed the genre of reference works and companion books as valuable and important and that authors don't have an automatic right to control what's written about their works."
In an interview with the Grand Rapids Press, Vander Ark commented, "I've always been a fan of Harry Potter and of Rowling and my hope all along was that we'd find an amicable way to settle this," Vander Ark said from England this on Tuesday morning. "I'm disappointed, but this is the way it went and I don't hold any ill will at all. It was a question of law over a difference of opinion and, in a way, I'm glad that it's finally over." He is currently creating a new version of the Lexicon and writing a "Harry Potter"-themed travel memoir, relating his experiences of visiting various locations mentioned in the "Harry Potter" books.
Novelist Joanna Trollope commented in "The Times" that, "This is not a matter of that age-old - and impossible - difficulty of the plagiarism of ideas. It is something much easier to define, and a danger to all writers. It is - let's not mince our words - the theft of someone's writing, someone's own words stolen in exactly the form in which their brain produced them. And it's a theft to which all writers are vulnerable. Jo Rowling didn't have to do this. I should think that her time in New York was horrible, exacerbated by a lack of support caused, no doubt, by deeply unattractive sourness over her wealth. Well, I applaud her, and I bet I'm not alone. I am thrilled for her, and very grateful to her, for taking the stand she did - and winning."
Appeal.
Vander Ark and Rapoport considered appealing the decision, and said that the book could be edited until it complies with the ruling. Patterson said he expected this case could go as far as the Supreme Court. In December 2008, RDR Books dropped its appeal, and instead decided to release another unauthorized "Harry Potter" guide ("The Lexicon: An Unauthorized Guide to Harry Potter Fiction and Related Materials"), which would include far more commentary than the original. The book was released on January 16, 2009.
Implications.
An analysis by Jonathan Band for the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) and the American Library Association (ALA) contends that "the big winner actually was fair use." Band found a number of "pro–fair-use holdings" and concluded that the decision "provides a clear roadmap for how to avoid infringement claims when creating" reference guides to literary works, even when the guides do not contain scholarly criticism or analysis. 
Matthew Rimmer, an Australian law expert, commented that the ruling, "is an important precedent in respect of the defense of fair use and it represents a victory of authorial rights over the freedoms of secondary users of copyright works ... The case leaves the way open for future conflict over derivative works, character merchandising and fan fiction based upon the "Harry Potter" series."
David Ardia of the Citizen Media Law Project opined that, "there is some good news in the opinion for fair use advocates. First, the court concluded that reference guides such as the Lexicon are transformative in character and in order to fulfill their purpose they must be able to "make considerable use of the original works ... Second, reference works don't lose their transformative nature just because they lack analysis or commentary. The court rejected Rowling's argument that the Lexicon is not transformative because it fails to add these elements ... Third, copyright holders cannot exert exclusive control over the market for reference works. According to Judge Patterson, even a copyright holder as eager as Rowling is to control through licensing all related markets must face limits."

The Arizona Kid (1939 film)

The Arizona Kid is a 1939 American western film directed by Joseph Kane under the Republic Pictures banner. The film stars Roy Rogers as a Confederate officer in Missouri during the American Civil War.
Plot.
Roy and Gabby are Confederate scouts in Missouri during the American Civil War. Val McBride is a confederate guerilla officer, who doesn’t play by the rules. When Roy first rides into town, he encounters an old childhood friend, Dave Allen. Dave tells Roy that he has joined McBride’s guerilla force and Roy is not pleased. He tells Dave that McBride is not a man to be admired but Dave doesn’t listen. McBride arrives at the saloon where Dave and Roy are talking and Roy and McBride nearly end up in a fight. The arrival of Union scouts prevents the fight as McBride and his force, including Dave, ride away. Shortly afterwards, McBride is told by his superior Confederate officer that he must play by the rules or be stripped of his command. McBride, furious that his effective (if crude and ungentlemanly) fighting is being scorned, leaves the Confederates and continues to fight both sides on his own. 
Roy and Gabby are soon assigned to tracking down and killing McBride and his men. During a brief pause in their search, Roy, Gabby, and the men they have recruited agree to take a small shipment of gold through to another Confederate officer. In route, McBride attacks. Gabby is hurt, though not seriously, while Roy is nearly killed. Dave (still one of McBride’s men) hangs back and helps Gabby get Roy to a nearby cabin for help. Then he leaves to rejoin McBride. Roy and Gabby set out to resume their search a few months later. After a long and dangerous search, Roy and Gabby find and corner McBride’s men including Dave, but McBride escapes. While Gabby takes care of business, Roy chases McBride to a local saloon and boarding house where the matron hides McBride and refuses to tell Roy where he is. McBride comes out and takes a shot at Roy but misses and Roy returns fire, killing McBride.

Biography.
A. J. Thomas was born in Moonnilavu, a hilly region in south-central Kerala, in the foothills of the Western Ghats (Sahyadri), in the valley of Mount Illickan. For the first ten years of his life, he lived in an Eden-like situation in a hill-hamlet, Mechal, surrounded by pure nature where he enjoyed total freedom in the wilderness, like Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer rolled into one. His mother, though not much formally educated, was a poet by nature. She would treat the plants she nurtured and the animals she reared as her own children, and used to even talk to them endearingly, and quarrel with them if necessary. He owes his poetry to her. Later, in his early youth, it was during his two-year stay at Bandel, on the banks of the Ganges (Hooghly), in West Bengal that he began writing poetry in English. During the three years from 1973 to 1976 when he lived in Mananthavady, Wynad, a hotbed of intense political and cultural activity in those days of the beginning of the Emergency, his creative engagement began to take a definite direction.
When he moved from Wynad in 1976, to work with the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, in it Aranyanivas Hotel in Thekkady, Periyar Tiger Reserve (Wildlife Sanctuary) in Idukki District, in the High Ranges of south-central Kerala, he had the opportunity to see internationally famous writers like Dominique Lapierre, Sir Angus Wilson, Salman Rushdie, and Indian writers like Pritish Nandy, M. T. Vasudevan Nair and others, which inspired him. Writers like V. Sadasivan, the Kadammanitta Ramakrishnan,the poet who spearheaded the resurgence of raw energy in creativity and inspired pride in literary activities, Satchidanandan, E. V. Ramakrishnan, U. R. Anantha Murthy, R. Narendra Prasad, his friend and classmate A. Anvar Ali, Paul Zacharia, and others with whom he was deeply involved during this period, witnessed his gradual rise as a poet and translator.
It was about this time that his first collection of poems "Germination" (1989) came out.
The first book of translation with which Thomas came to be noticed was "Bhaskara Pattelar and Other Stories,"a collection of Paul Zacharia's stories, which he did along with Gita Krishnankutty and the author. The translation of Paul Zacharia's story “Salam America” brought him the Katha Award. Next, he won the First Prize in an international translation competition conducted in 1996 by Kerala Medical Graduates in the Americas, which included a cash award and a trip to the United States to participate in the Annual Convention of The Associated Writing Program in Washington, D.C. and to attend an International Workshop in Creative Writing at the Writers’ Center, Bethesda, Maryland.
The verse-fiction, "Ujjaini" based on the life Kalidasa, by O. N. V. Kurup, the doyen of Malayalam poetry, in Thomas's translation, won very great critical acclaim.
He grew strong in his translation of Malayalam poetry, fiction and drama, publishing them from reputed houses like Penguin India, Rupa and Co., Roli Books, and of course, from the National Academy of Letters. For translating the novel "Keshavan’s Lamentions," by the veteran Malayalam novelist M.Mukundan, he won the Vodafone Crossword Book Award 2007, which has been called the ‘Indian Booker Prize’.
Thomas goes on writing poetry in English regularly, publishing in leading journals and magazines like "The Little Magazine". He reads his poems in prestigious forums in the national capital and other cities like Calcutta.
The National Academy of Letters, in one of its National Executive Board Meetings, "suo motu" elected him on a permanent basis, as a literary translator, to its Panel of Translators.

Music law

Music Law refers to legal aspects of the music industry and certain legal aspects in other sectors of the entertainment industry. The music industry includes record labels, music publishers, merchandisers, the live events sector and of course performers and artists.
The terms "music law" and "entertainment law", along with "business affairs", are used by the music and entertainment industry and should not be thought of as academic definitions. Indeed, music law covers a range of traditional legal subjects including intellectual property law (copyright law, trademarks, image publicity rights, design rights), competition law, bankruptcy law, contract law, defamation and, for the live events industry, immigration law, health and safety law, and licensing.
Publishing.
Publishing is the primary source of income for musicians writing their own music. Money collected from the 'publishing' rights is ultimately destined for songwriters - the composers of works, whether or not they are the recording artist or performer. Often, songwriters will work for a musical ensemble to help them with musical aspects of the composition, but here again, the writer of the song is the owner of it and will own the copyrights in the song and thus will be entitled to the publishing revenues. Copyrights in compositions are not the same as sound recordings. A recording artist can record a song and sell it to another band or company. As a result, that particular company will own the recording, but not the song. The original writer will always maintain the copyright for that particular song. The publishing money is connected to the copyright, so the owner will be the only one making money off of the song itself. All successful songwriters will join a collection society (such as ASCAP and BMI in the USA, JASRAC in Japan GEMA in Germany and PRS for Music in the UK) and many will enter into agreements with music publishing companies who will exploit their works on the songwriters behalf for a share of ownership, although many of these deals involve the transfer (assignment) of copyright from the songwriter to the music publisher.
Both the recorded music sector and music publishing sector have their foundations in intellectual property law and all of the major recording labels and major music publishers and many independent record labels and publishers have dedicated "business and legal affairs" departments with in-house lawyers whose role is not only to secure intellectual property rights from recording artists, performers and songwriters but also to exploit those rights and protect those rights on a global basis. There are a number of specialist independent law firms around the world who advise on music and entertainment law whose clients include recording artists, performers, producers, songwriters, labels, music publishers, stage and set designers, choreographers, graphic artists, games designers, merchandisers, broadcasters, artist managers, distributors, collection societies and the live events sector (which further includes festivals, venues, promoters, booking agents and production service providers such as lighting and staging companies).
Business.
The US Government views artists that give concerts and sell merchandise as a business. Bands that tour internationally will also face a plethora of legislation around the world including health and safety laws, immigration laws and tax legislation. Also, many relationships are governed by often complex contractual agreements.
In the US it is important for musicians to get legal business licenses. These can be obtained at a city hall or local government center. The business license will require the tracking of sales, wages, and gigs. A tax ID is also necessary for all businesses. Musicians that fail to comply with the tax ID process and do not report their profits and losses to the government can face serious consequences with the IRS.

Unión Libre

"Unión libre. Cadernos de vida e culturas" ("Free Union. Review of Life and Culture") began as a series of annual publications devoted to life in the most integral and multicultural sense, although always in relation to creative work, preferably literary, and from a progressive point of view, totally open, critical, independent and free-thinking.
The first three issues contained a section of monographic studies, each devoted to an important topic, by specialists; a creative section consisting of translations of major texts from contemporary culture; unpublished works with an original focus; and a documentary dossier devoted to people and texts worthy of being preserved, honored, recognized and appreciated because they were forgotten, hidden, repressed, persecuted or exiled. With the same desire for rigorous analysis, creative freedom and commitment to remembering the past, the current phase was begun and is comprised completely of monographic issues.
"Unión libre" is the result of a project but also a reality: the free union of persons and ideas, of analysis and creation, of documented memory and artistic avant-garde, of polycentric research and integrating methodologies, of submersion in our roots and dialogues without borders, in sum, of life and cultures, by means of these radically energetic issues, even though they may contain a few fragments of scientific investigation, of free creation, of working memory and perhaps, of the freedom to live.

Palazzo Rivellino

Palazzo Rivellino, also called Rivellino, is a historical building in the municipality of Belmonte Calabro, in the province of Cosenza, Calabria, southern Italy. 
The first nucleus of the palace was built as a coastal tower or fortification in 1579 by Count Torino Ravaschieri Fieschi, to defend those along the coast against enemy attack from the Tyrrhenian Sea. In 1627, the defensive tower was transformed into a palace by Don Orazio Giovan Battista Ravaschieri Fieschi, 1st Prince of Belmonte. 
Between 1806 and 1807, the Palace of Rivellino became state property before being sold to the Giuliani family. Currently, the palace is divided between several private owners.
The palace has a remarkable inner courtyard, as well as an underground passage that exits into the open air, along the banks of the River Cervella.

Ranquel people

The Ranquel are an indigenous tribe from the northern part of La Pampa Province, Argentina, in South America. With Puelche, Pehuenche and also Patagones from the Günün-a-Küna group origins, they were conquered by the Mapuche.
Name.
The name "Ranquel" is the Spanish name for their own name of Rankülche: "rankül" -cane-, "che" -man, people- in Mapudungun; that is to say "cane-people"
History.
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Ranquel controlled two chiefdoms in Argentina. Between 1775-1790 a group of Pehuenche advanced from the side of the Andes mountains east to the territory they called "Mamül Mapu" ("mamül": kindling, woods; "mapu": land, territory) as it was covered by dense woods of "Prosopis caldenia", "Prosopis nigra", and "Geoffroea decorticans". They settled along the Cuarto and Colorado rivers, from the south of today's Argentine provinces of San Luis, Córdoba, to the south of La Pampa.
They were hunters, nomads and during a good part of the 19th century they had an alliance with the Tehuelche people, with whom they traveled east into the western part of today's Buenos Aires Province and southern end of Córdoba Province, and also to Mendoza, San Luis and Santa Fe. 
In 1833 Julio Argentino Roca led the Desert Campaign (1833–34), in which he attempted to eliminate the Ranquel.
Their leader at that time was Yanquetruz, and they put up a skilled defense, making good use of the desert terrain. 
Yanquetruz was succeeded around 1834 by Painé Guor.
Their last chief was Pincén, who was confined to the prison at Martín García island (1880).
They allied themselves with the forces of Felipe Varela during the rebellion against the Paraguayan War and the Central Government in Buenos Aires. After Pincén's capture, the Ranquels were further reduced in population during the Conquest of the Desert, with their lands being occupied by the army. A reservation, the Colonia Emilio Mitre, was established for them in today's La Pampa province, where their descendants lived today.
Recent developments.
On 14 August 2007 the government of San Luis province returned to the Ranquel people, including two small lakes, about south of the town of Fraga.

Erik Glavic

Erik Glavic is a Canadian football quarterback who is currently a free agent, is in his fifth and final year of his CIS university career - playing CIS football with the Calgary Dinos. Previously a member of the Saint Mary's Huskies, Glavic is the only CIS football player to have won the Hec Crighton Trophy with two different teams. His brother Sasha Glavic is a former defensive back for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League.
University career.
Glavic was named starting quarterback in his third season with the Huskies, after being used the previous year mainly for short yardage situations. Glavic had a great year with 1,843 passing yards, and 478 rushing yards. Glavic's main asset is his ability to scramble as he added 5 rushing touchdowns to his 16 passing. In the 2007 Uteck Bowl Glavic passed for 102 yards and one touchdown, while adding 41 yards and one touchdown rushing. Glavic left the game early with an injured knee. The Huskies won the game and advanced to the national championship. Glavic found out later he would miss the Vanier Cup with an ACL tear. The Huskies would lose the championship 28-14. Glavic would nonetheless be named the Hec Crighton Award winner for 2007 as the CIS football MVP.
Glavic was poised to be the starter for the 2008 season after a Hec Crighton Award winning season, however Glavic struggled to rehabilitate his knee. He ended up only playing a portion of a single game the entire season.
In January, it was announced that Glavic was transferring to the University of Calgary to begin classes immediately and play for the Calgary Dinos in the 2009 season. After leading his team to a 7-1 record, Glavic enjoyed an outstanding season, completing 67.5 percent of his passes for 2,185 yards and 14 touchdowns. He also added 503 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns, good for fourth in the conference. After defeating the Saskatchewan Huskies to win the Hardy Trophy, the Dinos beat the Saint Mary's Huskies 38-14 in the Uteck Bowl to earn the right to play in the Vanier Cup game. Glavic won the Hec Crighton Trophy for the second time in his career and became the first player to win the award with two different teams. Glavic and the Dinos would go on to lose the Vanier Cup game 33-31 to the Danny Brannagan-led Queen's Golden Gaels.
Professional career.
Glavic was one of three CIS quarterbacks to be invited to the Canadian Football League's 2010 Evaluation Camp, even though his draft eligibility year was the year before. Shortly after, Glavic was added to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats' negotiation list in anticipation of a rule change where Canadian quarterbacks do not count as a roster spot in training camp.

A Yiddish World Remembered

A Yiddish World Remembered is a 2002 Emmy-award-winning documentary by Andrew Goldberg that uses archival photographs, never-before-seen archival videos, and survivor testimony to reconstruct the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe, which were destroyed by the Holocaust. Oscar nominated actor Elliott Gould narrates.
Summary.
Long before the Holocaust, antisemitism threatened Eastern European Jews. Many Jews immigrated to the region after having been expelled from Western Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, and their communities only became more concentrated when the Russian government confined them to the area, specifically the nations of modern-day Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Slovakia, and parks of Northern Hungary.
Once they were settled, the Jews still weren't safe. A never-before-seen film shot in the 1920s reveals the aftermath of a pogrom, where Cossacks tore through Jewish neighborhoods raping, maiming, killing, and looting.
But terror and hostility unified the Jewish community by forcing them to rely on one another. Jews in a shtetl all chipped in to help care for the poor in their community.
The film explores the uniqueness of the Yiddish language. To prove the sting of a Yiddish insult, one survivor says, “May all your teeth fall out, and may one remain as a tooth ache.”
The survivors also talk about the Jewish dishes they enjoyed in their Eastern European homes. “Cherry pierogis are like a dream in my mind,” one survivor says.
They survivors all have nothing but praise for their mothers--balebustes (amazing housewives), who kept the family running. “She didn’t have to go to places to exercise,” one survivor says of his mother, “a machine couldn’t do all that she did.”

Iraq–Italy relations

Iraqi–Italian relations are the interstate ties relations between Iraq and Italy. Iraq has an embassy in Rome and Italy has an embassy in Baghdad and a consulate-general in Basra.
History.
From Iraq's independence (1932) to the Ba'ath revolution (1968).
In June 1940, when Fascist Italy joined the second world war, on the side of Germany, the British-siding Iraqi government did not break off diplomatic relations, as they had done with Germany. Thus the Italian Legation in Baghdad became the chief centre for Axis propaganda and for fomenting anti-British feeling. In this they were aided by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The Grand Mufti had fled from Palestine shortly before the outbreak of war and later received asylum in Baghdad.
Following the 1941 Iraqi coup d'état, the immediate plans of Iraq's new leaders were to refuse further concessions to the United Kingdom, to retain diplomatic links with Fascist Italy, and to expel most prominent pro-British politicians from the country.
In the aftermath of the Anglo-Iraqi War, Rashid Ali and the Mufti of Jerusalem fled to Persia, then to Turkey, then to Italy, and finally to Berlin, Germany, where Ali was welcomed by Hitler as head of the Iraqi government-in-exile. In propaganda broadcasts from Berlin, the Mufti continued to call on Arabs to rise up against the British and aid German and Italian forces. He also helped recruit Muslim volunteers in the Balkans for the "Waffen SS".
Iran-Iraq war.
Relations between the two strengthened when Italy sent economic and naval assistance to Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.
Italy provided substantial supplies to Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War. Its greatest impact, however, was financial, with the U.S. branch of the state-owned, largest bank, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in Italy providing several billion dollars in funding for Iraqi military procurement. Italy also was a primary supplier to the Iraqi nuclear program, although that was not of direct effect on the Iran–Iraq War.
With respect to conventional military supplies, Italy provided land and sea mines to both Iraq and Iran. Iraq had ordered naval vessels and helicopters from Italy, although the ships were seized under the embargo.
In 1990 Roberto Formigoni garnered attention when he was involved in a mission to Iraq which successfully concluded with the freeing of some Italian technicians who were held hostages of the local government.
The 1991 Gulf War.
Italy, along with other European and non-aligned states, supported the January 1991 French proposal of a UN resolution calling for "a rapid and massive withdrawal" from Kuwait along with a statement to Iraq that Council members would bring their "active contribution" to a settlement of other problems of the region, "in particular, of the Arab-Israeli conflict and in particular to the Palestinian problem by convening, at an
appropriate moment, an international conference" to assure "the security, stability and development of this region of the world.". The U.S. and Britain rejected it (along with the Soviet Union, irrelevantly).
Italy then joined the multinational coalition for Operation Desert Shield.
Saddam Hussein's last period (1991-2003).
Iraq and Italy agreed to enhance parliamentary relations during a meeting in mid-2000, between acting Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) Speaker Hamid Rashid Al-Rawee and a visiting Italian parliamentary delegation. Al-Rawee reviewed Iraq's relations with Italy and expressed hope of expanding them in all fields, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. Roco Puticlon, head of the Italian delegation, confirmed the necessity to promote parliamentary relations with Iraq, and expressed solidarity with the Iraqi people in confronting the decade-old U.N. sanctions.
Roberto Formigoni was later involved in the Oil-for-food scandal, when he bought 1,000,000 oil barrels (160,000 m3).
The involvement of Italy in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
In January 2003, activists of the Italian Radical Party tried to broker an agreement ("Free Iraq" campaign) that would lead to the exile of Saddam Hussein and to a peaceful transition in Iraq, thus stopping the invasion. The Italian Parliament had mandated the government, who had accepted, to pursue the "Free Iraq" aim, as an alternative to war. The move was stopped by US and UK governments' unwillingness to achieve it, although Italy had secured Saddam's acceptance through contacts with Muammar al-Gaddafi. The Radicals later strongly opposed the execution of Saddam Hussein and of Tareq Aziz.
The Berlusconi government then totally backed the United States in their attempt to obtain a UN mandate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
In February 2003, US Secretary of State Colin Powell addressed the United Nations General Assembly, continuing US efforts to gain UN authorization for an invasion. Powell presented evidence alleging that Iraq was actively producing chemical and biological weapons and had ties to al-Qaeda. As a follow-up to Powell’s presentation, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Japan, and Spain proposed a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, but NATO members like Canada, France, and Germany, together with Russia, strongly urged continued diplomacy. Facing a losing vote as well as a likely veto from France and Russia, the US, UK, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and Australia eventually withdrew their resolution.
In March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, Poland, Denmark, and Italy began preparing for the invasion of Iraq, with a host of public relations and military moves. In his March 17, 2003 address to the nation, Bush demanded that Hussein and his two sons, Uday and Qusay, surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline. But the US began the bombing of Iraq on the day before the deadline expired. On March 18, 2003, the bombing of Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Poland, Australia, and Denmark began. Unlike the first Gulf War or the war in Afghanistan (2001–present), this war had no explicit UN authorisation.
Due to the 2003 Iraq war many historical artifacts have either been stolen or damaged; however, over 40 ivory pieces were restored in Rome, in the workshops of the Istituto Centrale per il Restauro (Central Institute for Restoration). Baghdad's Iraqi National Museum owns the greatest collection of Assyrian ivories in the world. Over the last fifteen years, this collection, both the pieces held in the vaults of the Iraqi Central Bank and those still held in the Museum, has suffered as a result both of the war and of poor conservation conditions. Some of the most precious objects were restored by the "Istituto Centrale per il Restauro" team in 2004, immediately after the installation of a new restoration workshop provided by the Italian Ministry of Culture.
The 2003 Nasiriyah bombing was a suicide attack on the Italian military police headquarters in Nasiriyah, Iraq, south of Baghdad on November 12, 2003. At least 28 people were killed, including 17 Italian "carabinieri", two Italian civilians, and nine Iraqi civilians. More than 100 people were injured, including 19 Italian soldiers.
The attack was the worst incident involving Italian soldiers since Operation Restore Hope in Somalia and the highest loss of Italian soldiers since World War II.
The Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena was a covert operation by the Italian military secret service, SISMI, to rescue Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena from kidnappers in Iraq. After the successful retrieval of Ms Sgrena, on March 4, 2005, the car with her and two secret agents came under friendly fire by US Army troops along the Baghdad airport road; secret agent Nicola Calipari was killed by US Army Specialist Mario Lozano. The incident created tension between the two countries, and arguably increased public hostility in the Italian public towards the United States of America.
Italian troops pulled out of Iraq in 2008, following the establishment of the Prodi government in Italy
Iraqi diaspora in Italy.
The current population of Iraqis in Italy stands at around 17,300; however one source claims there to be 56,300, which is approximately 50 families. Most of these are priests, nuns and seminarians who have come to pursue their studies in Italy. The majority are residents of Rome.

Duke Road Racing Rankings

With road circuits such as the Isle of Man TT and Ulster Grand Prix being dropped from the FIM Moto GP calendar, and with the FIM Formula 1 being dropped in 1988. Geoff Duke and his son Peter (Duke Video and DVD publishers) thought that the road racing scene, at least in the UK and Ireland should be rewarded with a championship.
The Duke Road Race Rankings has rapidly approached its 10th anniversary, and as last year’s competition demonstrated, the series is going from strength to strength. Dungannon’s Ryan Farquhar enjoyed a stunning season to win the 2012 standings, heading Michael and William Dunlop and fourth place Guy Martin. It was the seventh time Farquhar had taken the title, making him the most successful rider in Duke Road Race Rankings’ history.
Established in 2002, the Duke Road Race Rankings is the only series which recognises the season-long performances on the roads. It was the idea of Peter Duke, boss of the Isle of Man-based Duke Video and son of World Champion Geoff Duke. He worked with road racing journalist Leslie Moore, author Mac McDiarmid and archivist Phil Edge to develop a scoring system which would recognise the significance of the event as well as the individual performance and, for the first time, allow a year-long assessment of road racing, letting the most consistent racer claim the ‘championship’ title. Since that first year in 2002, won by Ian Lougher, all the big names of road racing have figured, with the likes of Adrian Archibald, Richard Britton, Jason Griffiths, Darran Lindsay and, more recently, Manxman Conor Cummins, battling for honours.
The purpose of the Duke Road Race Rankings is to recognise achievements across the year, to give those riders who commit themselves not just to the ‘major’ meetings, but also to the smaller road races to have their dedication and hard work celebrated. Star names determined to claim the impressive Geoff Duke Trophy will attend lower profile events to earn points, helping to ensure strong grids for meetings which would otherwise be in the shadow of the Isle of Man TT, North West 200 and Ulster Grand Prix. Figuring on the Duke Road Race Rankings’ calendar alongside the International events also gives these events increased prestige. A look through the records reveals that, despite some fascinating battles, the spoils have been split between Ryan Farqhuar and Ian Lougher, apart from 2007. In that amazing year Conor Cummins, from the Isle of Man, took on and beat the best in only his second full season on the roads.
The Duke Road Race Rankings series features around two dozen meetings every year, including many of the long-established Irish and Isle of Man road races, and has remained largely unaltered since 2002 – apart from cancellations and the addition of new meetings, such as the Armoy Road Races 4 years ago. The standing of the series continues to grow, with extensive coverage in leading specialist publications, such as Motor Cycle News, Road Racing Ireland and Irish Racer, and the annual presentation being made at star-studded, black tie events. Ryan Farquhar received the trophy for his 2011 victory at the Adelaide Racer Awards in Belfast in January, in front of racing greats.
2013 season.
The Duke Road Race Rankings Series commenced for its 12th year of competition at Oliver's Mount, 
Scarborough, North Yorkshire on Sunday 21 April 2012 at the Ian Watson Spring Cup National Road Races. Organised by the Auto 66 Club.
Unfortunately the Bush and Kells Road Races announced at the beginning of the year they would skip 2013 so to concentrate on raising funds with the plan to return next year.
The overall winner this year of the Duke road race rankings championship was Michael Dunlop. It turned into a wonderful year of racing for Michael who won four races in a week at the Isle of Man TT and won at the North West 200, Ulster Grand prix, Armoy road races, Southern 100 and for the first time won the Steve Henshaw international gold cup

2011 season.
The Duke Road Race Rankings celebrated its 10th year in 2011 and has gone from strength to strength over the decade. Last year’s provisional calendar, began with the Ian Watson Spring Cup at Scarborough on 17 April, boasted 26 meetings, including the TT, and ran until 9 November with the season-closing Macau Grand Prix, which joined the schedule in 2010 for the first time.
In 2011 Ryan Farquhar retained the Duke Road Rankings title for the fourth successive year and his sixth time in all and will receive the 'new' Geoff Duke Trophy at the Adelaide Motorcycle Awards Night in Belfast in January 2012.
Ryan has the original trophy in his permanment collection having won the unique award outright after competing a hat-trick of title wins in 2008, 2009 and 2010.
2011 Results.
Ryan Farquhar says he is 'made up' to win his sixth Duke Road Race Rankings Series after another superb season on his KMR Kawasaki machines. The Dungannon racer claimed 43 victories and 11 podium finishes on his way to a winning points tally of 3,754.
Farquhar, 34, said: "It's my fourth in a row and I am made up to win it again. It's been another grand season."
William Dunlop claimed second place ahead of brother Michael, who won a second TT title in 2011. Farquhar set 27 fastest laps during the 23-round series but said he was disappointed at not claiming more wins at the International road races.
"The national races went great but we had a few problems at the internationals this year for a few different reasons and I will be looking to put that straight next season," he added. Farquhar won at both the Manx Grand Prix and Southern 100 meetings on the Isle of Man this year.
Ian Lougher, who was the inaugural winner in 2002 and took the titles again in 2005 and 2006, finished in fourth place.
John Burrows slotted into fifth place, a climb of three places on the previous year, whilst Castletown's Chris Palmer took sixth ahead of Guy Martin, Cameron Donald and Davy Morgan.

2008 Results.
TT winner Ryan Farquhar has clinched the Duke Road Race Rankings for the third time. He wrapped up a brilliant 2008 season by clinching the rankings title at the final meeting of the year, the Gold Cup races at Oliver’s Mount, Scarborough. The Dungannon ace put in a series of high-class performances and a quartet of podium finishes to complete an excellent year.
Farquhar said: ‘It’s been a really good weekend and it’s great to end the year with more success and my third Duke Championship.’
The 2008 Duke Road Race Rankings had been scheduled to be held over 23 rounds, but that number was cut to 19 due to four race meetings being hit by bad weather and other factors.

Previous winners.
2007
One of the stars of the Centenary TT has secured the Geoff Duke Trophy as winner of the Duke Road Race Rankings.
Manxman Conor Cummins, who secured a fifth, two sixths and an eighth place at TT, secured the top position without turning a wheel in the final round.
With a commanding lead in the series, Cummins decided to sit out the final round - the 57th Steve Henshaw International Gold Cup Races. It must have been a nail-biting weekend for the 21- year-old star as he waited to see if second-placed Guy Martin could do enough to overhaul his lead.
Guy, who secured three podium finishes at the Centenary TT, and his Hydrex Honda were almost unbeatable at Oliver’s Mount, Scarborough. He re-wrote the record books, but it wasn’t enough to beat Conor’s Duke Road Race Rankings lead.
Guy had to settle for second place, 138 points behind, but 281 points ahead of third placed William Dunlop. It is a remarkable feat by Conor, of Ramsey, in only his first full year of pure road racing.
Duke Video managing director Peter Duke offered his congratulations to Conor. ‘What a fantastic result for the Isle of Man, and for road racing in general, to have Conor with the Geoff Duke Trophy in only his first full year in pure road racing. He has always shown great promise on both short and road circuits, but to be number one with such consistency, maturity and sheer speed against top opposition tells us we have a real star in the making here.’
2006
The twenty-five round series, held at all national and international road races in the north and south of Ireland, the Isle of Man and England, was the closest fought to date.
At the conclusion of the series a mere 147 points separated the champion and second place man, Martin Finnegan, who in turn was just nine points ahead of the late Darran Lindsay. Guy Martin joined the fray in 15th position after the North West 200 and only competed in a handful of road races in 2006, but still managed to finish in an impressive fourth place, with Raymond Porter and Cameron Donald, completing the top six.
The famous Dunlop family filled three of the top ten places, Michael in seventh, William in ninth and Robert in tenth position.

Hadena irregularis

The Viper's Bugloss "(Hadena irregularis)" is a species of moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found in Europe.
The wingspan is 32–36 mm. The moth flies from July to August depending on the location.
The larvae feed on "Silene otites" and "Gypsophila" species.
In 1998 the United Kingdom government removed "Hadena irregularis" from schedule 5 (animals) of the The Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981 as it is believed to be extinct. The cause of extinction has been hypothesised to be destruction of habitat, primarily the food source, which in the United Kingdom was limited to Spanish catch-fly ("Silene otites").

Charles Namoloh

Major General Charles Dickson Ndaxu Phillip Namoloh (born 28 February 1950) is a Namibian diplomat, politician and military figure. Beginning in 2005, Namoloh has been a member of the National Assembly of Namibia, as well as the defense minister of the country from 2005 to 2012. He currently is Namibia's Minister of Regional and Local Government, Housing and Rural Development.
Personal.
Namoloh was born on 28 February 1950, in Odibo, Ovamboland (now Ohangwena Region).
Career.
Namoloh entered politics as a union organizer for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in 1971, in Walvis Bay during the Namibian War of Independence. Temporarily fleeing to southern Angola, Namoloh returned but was arrested in 1973 for pro-SWAPO activities. After spending time in prison, Namoloh was released to Kwanyama (Ovamboland) authorities to receive lashes for supporting SWAPO. Following the decolonization of Angola in 1974 following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, Namoloh fled with other SWAPO Party Youth League members through Angola to SWAPO bases in Zambia. Rising quickly through the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), Namoloh became the chief of staff of Dimo Hamaambo in 1979. He fought under the nom de guerre "Ho Chi Minh". Namoloh helped establish the Namibian Defence Force following independence in 1990 and worked within the NDF 1990-95. In 1995, Namoloh was sent to Angola as Namibia's representative. In 2003, the former PLAN commander was sent to New Delhi, India as Namibia's top diplomat in that country. 
Namoloh returned home in 2005 to be selected for the National Assembly and the Defense ministry position which he held until the fifth SWAPO congress at the end of November 2012. In the wake of this congress a Cabinet reshuffle followed on 4 December 2012, in which Namoloh was deployed as Minister of Regional and Local Government, Housing and Rural Development, succeeding Jerry Ekandjo. Former Prime Minister Nahas Angula took over Namoloh's Defence portfolio.

Napatree Point

Napatree Point, often referred to simply as "Napatree", is a long sandy spit created by a geologic process called longshore drift. Up until the Hurricane of 1938, Napatree was sickle-shaped and included a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) long northern extension called Sandy Point. Napatree now extends 1.5 miles (2.4 km) westward from the business district of Watch Hill, a village in Westerly, Rhode Island forming a protected harbor. It is the southernmost and westernmost point of mainland Rhode Island.
Name origin.
Reportedly, the name "Napatree" derives from Nap or Nape (Neck) of Trees. Napatree Point was once heavily wooded. However, when the Great September Gale of 1815 struck the area, the trees were destroyed.
Geography and geology.
Napatree Point is a slender, 1.5 mile long peninsula in Block Island Sound. To the north of the peninsula is Little Narragansett Bay, a small estuary into which the Pawcatuck River empties. The small bay is an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean.
The peninsula is partially made from longshore drift. It is also made from glacial moraine, and is similar in makeup to nearby Fishers Island. The same moraine that Fishers Island is made out of resurfaces in Watch Hill, the village which contains Napatree Point. This region of the Northeastern United States made by glacial moraines from the Wisconsonian glaciation is known as the Outer Lands.
History.
In 1898, the federal government purchased at the elbow of Napatree Point for the construction of a coastal artillery installation, one of many such forts designed to protect the eastern entrance to Long Island Sound as part of a defense network for New York City. Fort Mansfield began operations in 1901. However, war games in 1907 demonstrated a fatal design flaw, and by 1909 it was removed from the list of active posts.
In 1926, the government put the land up for sale. A New York developer proposed Sandy Point be subdivided in 674 lots. A private syndicate of Watch Hill residents mobilized to prevent the construction of "cheap little houses" and protect the exclusive character of their town. The purchase was finalized in 1928, and all government buildings at Fort Mansfield were demolished that winter. Today, all that remains are the three concrete gun emplacements, which were left behind. The syndicate was unable to meet mortgage payments and in 1931 the land was foreclosed upon by the Washington Trust Company.
The Hurricane of 1938 caught New England by surprise. Forty-two people were in their Fort Road homes on Napatree when the hurricane struck, and 15 died. The storm demolished all the homes built on Napatree as well as one of the Fort Mansfield gun emplacements. It created several breachways in the spit. The first of these breachways was near the current beach club bathhouses. At least three more broke the connection between Sandy Point and Napatree Point, severing it from the mainland. Sandy Point is now an island in Little Narragansett Bay. Combined with the 1938 hurricane, erosion by the sea has caused the Napatree beach line to retreat some 200 feet since the mid-1930s.
In 1940, the Sandy Point portion was deeded to Alfred Guildersleeve of Stonington, Connecticut. In 1945, the remainder of the land was sold to the Watch Hill Fire District for $10,000.
Present-day conservation.
Napatree Point is now a wildlife preserve and a popular public beach protected by the Watch Hill Conservancy and Fire District, which have hired wardens to protect the area's wildlife and habitat. These wardens work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the piping plover, a federally endangered species. Napatree is also home to ospreys and a resting area for migratory birds.

Richard Poon

Richard Poon (born December 8, 1973) is a Chinese Filipino singer-songwriter and TV personality in the Philippines. He is a former member of U-Turn. He has gone on a successful solo career, and is a well-known jazz singer in the Philippines.
Early life.
Poon was born on December 8, 1973 in Makati City, Philippines. Despite being of Chinese descent, he was raised by his parents Robert Poon and Eva Huang in the Philippines, together with his sister Eva Marie. He inherited his singing skills from his mother. Another field in which he has established a good reputation is in the Culinary Arts. He specializes in Oriental food available in his Little Poon Restaurant.
As a musician, Poon together with his skilled four piece band, have proudly graced many lounges and bars across Metro Manila, including a regular stint at Eastwood Central Plaza. They are also consistently invited to perform in various weddings,
Personal life.
Richard Poon is married to Maricar Reyes. They were married on June 9, 2013 at the Bellevue Hotel in Alabang, Muntinlupa City.
Career.
Though it may have become the norm for many an artist aiming to make it big in the local, music scene to simply accede and conform to prevailing musical trends and fads, there are still a few who admiringly dare to be different, taking themselves to task by choosing to take the road less traveled, aspiring for glory on their own terms.
Among them is young, up and coming singer Richard Poon who is fast making his mark even as he continues to steer away from doing usual pop fare, keenly devoted as he is to becoming a romantic crooner in the vein of Harry Connick, Michael Buble and famous balladeer Jose Mari Chan.
Poon describes his music as "Fresh, Old-school," which is only apt as his repertoire is filled with highly-energized, inspiring takes of the standards famously rendered by the likes of Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Rod Stewart among others. Born and raised in the Philippines, Poon inherited his parents' special skills. He got his musical skills from his mom who is a big star in Taiwan and his culinary expertise from his Cantonese dad who is a restaurateur/chef based in Hong Kong.
Poon is an accomplished musician whose deep knowledge of music allows him to delve into a wide variety of other musical genres. It is as such, that during his well-attended concerts, aside from his usual set of standards, Poon would also often treat his audience with unexpected, inimitable covers of many contemporary hits as well.
As exciting and prolific as he is, Poon together with his skilled four piece jazz band, have proudly graced many lounges and bars across the metro including a regular stint at Eastwood Central Plaza. They are also consistently invited to perform in various weddings, corporate shows and parties.
Besides being adept in re-interpreting well-loved tunes of old, Poon also sings and writes his own music, one of which dubbed, "Lalala" was sung by Regine Velasquez and Piolo Pascual for the soundtrack of their movie "Paano Kita Iibigin."
Television.
Currently, Richard sings regularly every Sunday at Philippines’ no. 1 variety show ASAP (ABS-CBN channel 2) with the powerhouse cast of ASAP Sessionistas (Bossa Nova princess Sitti, powerful belter & Diamond Record Awardee Nina, well-loved pop-folk singer/guitarist Aiza Seguerra, sweet-singing Juris Fernandez (formerly of MYMP), R&B singer Duncan Ramos, acoustic sweetheart Princess Velasco, and popular rocker Kean Cipriano)
Awards.
In 2008, in his first year as a solo artist, Richard won prestigious back-to-back Awit Awards’ Best New Male Recording Artist and Aliw Awards Best Male Performer in Hotels, Bars and Music Lounges.
In 2009, Richard was awarded Breakthrough Artist of the Year by the 1st Radio Music Awards and bagged the 2009 Best Male Entertainer and Recording Artist by the Dangal Ng Bayan “Who’s Who in the Philippines”.
In 2010, Richard garnered the Aliw Awards Best Male Concert Performer.

Palatography

Palatography is a technique used to identify which parts of the mouth are used when making different sounds. This technique is often used by linguists doing field work on little-known natural languages. A record made through palatography is called a "palatogram".
It involves painting a coloring agent, such as a dye or a mixture of charcoal and olive oil on the tongue or the roof of a person's mouth and having that person pronounce a specific sound. A photograph is then made of the mouth roof and tongue in order to determine how the sound was articulated.
The technique can also be performed electronically using a tool called a pseudo-palate, which consists of a retainer-like plate lined with electrodes that is placed on the roof of the mouth while the speaker pronounces a sound.

Cartilage tumors form in Cartilage tissue. They can be either benign (Chondroma) or malignant (chondrosarcoma). Frequently these tumors appear in bone, and not in pre-existing cartilage tissue. In some cases tumors that formed in other tissues may produce a cartilage-like matrix, an example of this is the pleomorphic adenoma of the sexual reproduction salivary glands.

Southern Gospel Choir

The Southern Gospel Choir is a gospel choir based at the Tasmanian Conservatorium of Music in Hobart, Tasmania, and is directed by Dr. Andrew Legg.
The choir and its band, the Very Righteous Gospel Band were formed by Dr. Legg in 2000, soon after he became a staff member at the Conservatorium.
The Southern Gospel Choir and Legg have received acclaim internationally with leading gospel artists in the USA. Legg has worked with many prominent US gospel artists including Myron Butler, Kirk Franklin, Horace Clarence Boyer, Marvin Weatherford and Xanielle Davis. The choir were nominated for an ARIA award in 2005.
Choir structure.
The choir consists of three main groups:
Members of the choir range in age from 14 to 60 and come from many varied backgrounds and parts of the Tasmanian community.
Many Hobart musicians, especially singers, are or have previously been members of the Southern Gospel Choir, and some have been featured as soloists, including vocal coach Maria Lurighi. Soloists are usually picked from the choir by Lurighi or Dr. Legg to suit a particular song.
Styles.
Whilst performing under the general genre of gospel music, the Southern Gospel Choir integrates songs of many styles into its repertoire. These include traditional spirituals such as Steal Away, as well as many contemporary pieces which take their inspiration from styles such as jazz, funk, pop, rock, and hip hop. This is intended to make the music performed by the choir accessible and enjoyable to a wide range of audiences.
The Southern Gospel Choir performs varied styles of gigs, from performances with their band to "unplugged" concerts with just piano and choir, to collaborations with other musicians such as The Idea of North and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. A usual concert consists of many songs from various styles of gospel music, some with the band and some without, and many of the pieces feature soloists and improvisation.
Association with the Conservatorium & University.
The Southern Gospel Choir is run as several units at the Tasmanian Conservatorium of Music, which is part of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Tasmania. Members of the general public who are not enrolled in a university degree can audition for and join the choir, and are then enrolled in the choir unit as a part of an Associate Degree in Music Studies. This can then count towards this degree (or a number of other degrees) if they choose to later enrol in a course at the University of Tasmania.
Many students at the Conservatorium who are enrolled in courses, classical or contemporary, such as the Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Music Studies, Associate degrees, Rock Revolutions or Musical Theatre courses use the gospel choir units to count towards their degrees.
Weekly rehearsals for the choir are held at the Conservatorium, and ticket sales for the choir's performances are handled by the Conservatorium's booking office.

Articular cartilage injuries

Cartilage structures and functions can relatively easily be harmed, often resulting in damage. Such damage can result from a variety of causes, resulting from a bad fall or sport-accident (traumatic), previous knee injuries (post-traumatic) or wear and tear over time. Immobilization for long periods can also result in cartilage damage.
Articular cartilage damage might be found on its own but it will more often be found in conjunction with injuries to ligaments and menisci. People with previous repairs to ligaments and or menisci often face greater chances of new articular cartilage damage due to altered mechanics in the joint.
Repairing articular cartilage damage.
Though articular cartilage damage is not life threatening, it does strongly affect the quality of life. Articular cartilage damage is often the cause of severe pain, swellings, strong barriers to mobility and severe restrictions to the patient's activities. Over the last decades, however, surgeons and biotech ventures have elaborated promising procedures that contribute to articular cartilage repair.

Otometeki Koi Kakumei Love Revo!!

Gameplay.
Love Revo takes place over a school year and works on a 3-day block basis where the player decides what actions to take for the next three days (one if it is a Sunday or a holiday). The player can choose to spend the whole day, or divide her day, using half the time for studying in school. The actions vary for each choice; if the player chooses to use the whole day, the actions follow as study, literature, science, and physical education. Whereas when the player choose to use half her day to study, after she may explore, eat candy to relieve her stress, diet, go to the club, and so on. On holidays and Sundays, all actions are available including going on a date with guys.
Plot.
The main character, (default name, changeable), was once a cute, beautiful girl, winning beauty contests in childhood. However, after losing to the temptation of junk food received from fans, she has steadily gained weight... until she reached 100 kg in her second year of high school. At the beginning of the school year, the main character and her brother moved into her father's mansion-like dorm. She discovered that the school's most popular guys are also moving in. Their impressions on her shocked her into starting a diet.
Gameplay.
Dieting is a half-day option on normal days and accumulates the most stress. The player can lose weight through exercises, by using equipment, or consuming slimming products. Each activity is given a star value and the player can only use up to certain values on different days. 
As a result of dieting, Hitomi will gain stress. In order to reduce stress, the main character has to consume snacks and foods which, sometimes, depending on the food, may increase weight. 
There are many shops and facilities that Hitomi can visit in the game. By using these shops to her advantage the main character can purchase snacks, dieting products, equipment and services like facials.
For each male character there are two endings: a love ending and a friend ending. In addition, there are two extra endings: one where Hitomi successfully diets but fails to win a boyfriend and one where she fails to diet altogether.
Characters.
The most popular guy at school. A perfectionist with a cool attitude, he has blond hair at medium length and normally stands at the front of the No.5 best of the school. It is said that because of his handsome attire many people come attracted to him but not many people can approach him also because of his cool attitude. During the character's diet training he visits her from time to time, but says only a few words of encouragement.
Ranked second most popular. Easy to talk to and loves sports. He had a friend who had once betrayed him and he could not trust anyone again. His smiles and laughs prove to be fake. He loves his dog, whom you can normally find going on a walk with.
Shouta is a year younger than the protagonist, he is one of the only guys that treat you nicely in the beginning of the game. He loves sweets and often invites the character to have some with him at night. He participates in the festival play with the player as the main character and he becomes rather fond of the character, even if she does not show affection to him, often saying things like "If you don't like something about me, tell me, 'cause I'll change it". You can meet him at the sports center on random days.
Fourth most popular guy. He is an heir to a Yakuza gang but he has a very different dream from being a Yakuza leader in mind. He is known as the cool, or mature guy of the school (a bit like Ichinose). He talks politely and the character can find him at the goods store after a while. He loves basketball although he claims to have no hobby. Although his attire may seem cold he's really very shy.
Fifth most popular. He is the nice, warm, caring, quiet type and loves reading. Quite sickly and collapses if too strained. Thought to have anemia.
The main character's childhood friend. With his father being a manga artist and his mother a cosplayer, he himself also grew to love anime and manga. Starts off as chubby like the main character but due to her influence decides to start dieting as well. He's always a bit timid or shy, blushing often when the character or Onii-chan compliments him. He worries about the character on her diet and later he goes to the US coming back slim and as handsome as the others, after not being able to eat the food properly and coincidentally breaking his glasses and switching to lens.
A student that transfers in week 2. He is still getting used to new life around campus and is often seen with Yurika. He has long purple hair and wears glasses. He is known to do ikabanna.
The school's doctor. Wakatsuki-sensei is rather like a student than a doctor. He loves alcohol, cigars and beer. He likes to tease the character and sometimes views her as 'impossible' but he helps her anyway. He is also a bachelor although he can't walk the character home as often as the others. He is always seen with a sky blue pony tail and head phones. 
The main character's brother. He is usually known as Onii-chan (big brother in Japanese). Onii-chan supports the main character through her diet and also makes monthly charts that show how 'in love' the various candidates are with her. He is quite hot-headed, gets jealous easily, very protective and has an obvious sister complex. He is quite popular within the fandom. He also gives you a monthly allowance of 5000 yen.
A hidden character based on the actual Matsuda Satoshi that can be unlocked if certain requirements are met.
Daughter of a high-class family. Yurika is beautiful to the point that flowers are usually seen around her. However her personality is the exact opposite. She loves picking on the main character, though acting kind or polite most of the time, she envies the main character for staying at the same house as the No.5 best. She is considered innocent and beautiful to the class room boys.
One of the main character's friends. She is the 2nd friend of the character, with two pink pony tails, she looks rather sleepy or calm.
One of the main character's friends, she has short black hair and looks rather cool. She cares deeply for the main character as a friend and stands by her side.
Manga.
A manga adaptation by Yūki Fujinari was published by Enterbrain beginning in 2006.
Reception.
Famitsu rated the PSP version 31 out of 40.
An English-language fan translation patch was made for the Nintendo DS version of "Otometeki Koi Kakumei Love Revo!".

<doc id="19026694" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19026694" title="Henry Andrews Bumstead">
Henry Andrews Bumstead

Henry Andrews Bumstead (1870–1920) was an American physicist known for his research into electromagnetism.
Education.
Bumstead graduated from the Decatur High School (Illinois). He then went to Johns Hopkins University in 1887, expecting to study medicine and to enter his father's profession. Courses taken under Fabian Franklin, however, turned his attention to mathematics. The influence of Rowland so stimulated the interest that he decided to switch to physics. After receiving his BA degree in 1891, he remained in Baltimore for two years as an assistant in the physics laboratory, taking as much graduate work as time would allow. Notebooks found among his effects show that he took a course in thermodynamics under Rowland in 1891 which included, in addition to the classical thermodynamics, a considerable amount of the material contained in Josiah Willard Gibbs' great work "On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances". The following year he attended Rowland's lectures on Electrostatics and on the Electromagnetic Theory of Light.
In 1893 Bumstead was brought to Yale University by Professor Charles S. Hastings as an instructor in the Sheffield Scientific School. What time he could spare from his teaching duties he devoted to continuing his study of physics in the Yale Graduate School. He took courses with Gibbs in Vector Analysis, Multiple Algebra, Thermodynamics, and Electromagnetic Theory of Light. Bumstead obtained his PhD in 1897, submitting as thesis a paper entitled "A Comparison of Electrodynamic Theories". Unfortunately it does not seem to have been published, the only copy in existence being the manuscript in the author's own handwriting which has been preserved in the archives of the Yale library.
Personal life.
The year before receiving his doctor's degree he married Luetta Ullrich, daughter of John Ullrich, a banker of Decatur, Illinois. A son, John Henry, was born in 1897 and a daughter, Eleanor, in 1902. The son has adopted the profession of his grandfather, having obtained his MD at Johns Hopkins University in 1923 and being at present connected with the Yale Medical School.
Career.
In 1900 Bumstead was promoted to an assistant professorship, and six years later he left the Sheffield Scientific School to succeed Arthur Williams Wright as Professor of Physics in Yale College and Director of the Sloane Physics Laboratory. In 1902 he published a short paper in which he showed how Maxwell's equations completely accounted for an anomaly in the reflection of electric waves which had been causing controversy. If standing waves are set up on a pair of parallel guide wires terminating
in a conducting plane at right angles to their length, the node in electric intensity found at the end of the wires is at a distance from the nearest node on the wires agreeing with the distance between other adjacent nodes. If, however, the conducting
plane is removed, the loop to be expected at the free end of the wires is found to be at a distance from the nearest node somewhat less than a quarter wavelength. Bumstead showed that the introduction of a fictitious magnetic conductivity into Maxwell's equations established a close correspondence between this case and the well-understood arrangement in which the ends of the parallel conductors are united by a short connecting wire.
Death.
The day after Christmas, 1920, he boarded a train for Chicago to attend the annual meeting of the American Physical Society. During the first two days of the session there were high gales and bitter cold. On the Wednesday evening he attended a meeting of the National Research committee of which he had been chairman, and contributed to the discussion until almost midnight. The morning of Friday, December 31, he spent with Robert Andrews Millikan, at whose home he had been staying, in going over the research work of the Ryerson Laboratory. He left Millikan about 11:30 am and started on the return trip to Washington in the early afternoon. During the evening he mentioned a feeling of fatigue to friends on the train and decided to retire early. The next morning his friends were surprised at his absence from breakfast in the dining car, and Vernon Kellogg went back to his berth to ascertain if he had been taken ill during the night. The curtains before the berth were still closed; on pulling them apart Kellogg found him dead. Apparently he had died from heart failure during his sleep.

Des White

__NOTOC__
Desmond Henry "Des" White (born 1927) is a New Zealand former professional rugby league footballer of the 1940s and 50s. A record-breaking goal-kicking fullback, he was named amongst the country's finest players of the 20th century. His total for points scored in all matches (61) for the Kiwis is a record 467 (7 tries and 233 goals). He won championships with Auckland's Ponsonby club and his total of 794 points (391 goals and four tries) is the all-time club record.
Playing career.
White played his first senior game with the Auckland Rugby League's Ponsonby club in 1947. 
White toured Britain with the New Zealand national team in 1951, playing in the first ever televised match of rugby league at Station Road, Swinton against Great Britain and kicking two goals. During the 1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand, White was selected to play for both Auckland and New Zealand at fullback. He later kicked a world record 11 goals (from 14 attempts) against Australia in 1952 when New Zealand won the Test series in Brisbane. On that tour he set another record by scoring 107 points to become the first Kiwi to top the century in Australia. White kicked 18 goals in the series, equalling the world record.
In 1954, while playing for Auckland against Great Britain, he ruptured his spleen when tackled illegally by Doug Greenall. White underwent surgery and was out of the game for two years, missing the first ever World Cup in 1954.
He scored 132 points in 21 tests, a Kiwi record until overtaken by Matthew Ridge. His total of 467 points in 61 matches in the black and white jersey may never be overtaken now that long tours are a thing of the past. White's record 202 points on the tour of Britain and France in 1951/52 will probably last forever.
Later years.
Following his retirement, White became a coach and led Auckland. He was appointed coach of the New Zealand national team in 1961, only spending one season in the position.
Des White was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. In 1995 he was one of the inaugural inductees of the NZRL's Legends of League. He is also an Auckland Rugby League Immortal.
In 2007, White was named at fullback in the New Zealand Rugby League's team of the century of 1907 to 2007.

The decoration was created by a decree of May 26, 1920, under the name Médaille d'honneur de la famille française ("Medal of Honour of the French Family") with the aim of honouring mothers of large families. The text of the decree underwent several changes before being completely reformed by a decree of October 28, 1982, which renamed the decoration Médaille de la Famille française ("Medal of the French Family"). This decree came into force on January 1, 1983, and was completed by an "arrêté" (administrative order) of March 15, 1983. The reform opened the award of the decoration to fathers or anyone else who had raised several children in an appropriate way: for example, the Catholic priest Père Mayotte, curate of the parish of Randan, Puy-de-Dôme was granted the award in recognition of his raising the six children of his housekeeper, a widow who died suddenly.
Decoration.
Three classes of medal exist: bronze for those raising four or five children, silver for parents of six or seven children, and gold for those with eight or more children. A bronze medal is also granted to widowed mothers of three children whose husbands have been killed in action. The recipient's eldest child must be at least sixteen years old. The medal is decorated with the words "Famille Française" ("French Family") and a modernistic image of a couple and their children. The words "République Française" ("French Republic") are inscribed on the reverse side. The ribbon is divided vertically into three equal parts, the outer two being red and the inner green. Recipients of silver and gold medals are also granted a rosette in the same colours.
Conditions.
Recommendations or applications for the award must be deposited at the local town hall. An enquiry into the family is then conducted. If the enquiry reports positively, the final decision on whether to grant the award belongs to the prefect of the department. While the award has always been open to mothers raising families alone, and to other single parents and legal guardians since the 1982 reforms, this applies only in cases of widowhood or abandonment: the medal is only granted to divorced parents in the most exceptional circumstances. The medal may be awarded posthumously, provided that the application is made within two years of the recipient's death.

Portman baronets

The Portman Baronetcy, of Orchard Portman in the County of Somerset, was a title in the Baronetage of England. It was created on 25 November 1611 for John Portman (d.1612), son of Sir Henry Portman, knight, (d.1590) of Orchard Portman, Somerset, by Jane Mitchell. Orchard Portman is 2 miles SE of Taunton. Sir Henry was the son of Sir William Portman (d.1557), Lord Chief Justice of England between 1555 and 1557. Sir William Portman had acquired land in Marylebone, London, which through the later housing developments of Henry William Portman became the Portman Estate, which today is one of Central London's largest landlords and is still the basis of the wealth of the Portman family. Sir Henry Portman, 2nd Baronet (d.1620/1 or 1623) was Member of Parliament for Somerset, and married Lady Anne Stanley, daughter of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby; they had no progeny. His heir was his brother Sir John Portman, 3rd Baronet (1605–1624), who died unmarried as a 19 year-old undergraduate at Wadham College, Oxford, in the chapel of which exists his elaborate marble monument containing his effigy. John's aunt Joan Portman was the wife of Sir John Wyndham (1558–1645) of Orchard Wyndham, Somerset, whose mother was Florence Wadham, who founded Wadham College in accordance with the wishes of her brother Nicholas Wadham. His brothers the fourth and fifth Baronets both represented Taunton in the House of Commons. The sixth Baronet was Member of Parliament for both Taunton and Somerset. The title became extinct on his death in 1690.
The family estates passed under a settlement to Henry Seymour, fifth son of Sir Edward Seymour, 3rd Baronet, of Berry Pomeroy and Anne, the second daughter of Sir John Portman, 1st Baronet. He took the surname Portman, but left no issue. The property then devolved upon William Berkeley, of Pylle, who took the surname Portman. His great-grandson was Edward Berkeley Portman, Member of Parliament for Dorset, father of Edward Portman, 1st Viscount Portman. See Viscount Portman for later history of the family.

Robert Lecker

Robert Lecker is a Canadian scholar, author, and Greenshields Professor of English at McGill University, where he specializes in Canadian literature. He received the H. Noel Fieldhouse Award for Distinguished Teaching at McGill University in 1985. Lecker is a leading authority on Canadian literature. In 2012, Lecker was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in recognition of his influential studies on literary value in English Canada and Canadian cultural identity. In addition to his teaching and academic writing, Lecker has held a number of prominent positions in the Canadian publishing industry throughout his career. He co-founded ECW Press in 1977, he co-edited the Canadian literary journal "Essays on Canadian Writing" between 1975 and 2004, he has edited several anthologies of Canadian and international literature, and he currently heads a literary agency in Montreal, the Robert Lecker Agency.
Biography.
Early Life and Education.
Lecker was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec and began his university studies at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in 1970. The following year, he transferred to York University in Toronto where he met Jack David, who had founded the critical journal "Essays on Canadian Writing" in 1974. Lecker joined the editorial board of "ECW" in 1975.
Academic Training and Teaching Posts.
Lecker completed his BA (1974), MA (1976), and PhD (1980) in English at York and was awarded a number of fellowships and scholarships throughout these years. Lecker discusses his formative experiences at York in his 2006 memoir, "Dr. Delicious". His PhD dissertation, “Time and Form in the Contemporary Canadian Novel,” examines disruptive representations of time in seven Canadian novels written between 1968 and 1977.
In 1977 Lecker and Jack David founded ECW Press, which was originally devoted to publishing reference works and critical studies about Canadian literature. The press expanded and moved into commercial trade publishing in the mid-1990s. Lecker managed the Montreal office and David ran the Toronto office. In 2003, Lecker left the press to start his own literary agency, Robert Lecker Agency.
Between 1978 and 1982, Lecker was Assistant Professor of English at the University of Maine at Orono.
Lecker began teaching at McGill University in 1982. He was Associate Chair of the Department of English from 1984 to 1986, and directed the M.A. Program from 1989 to 1993. He also served as a sexual harassment and discrimination officer for McGill University from 1995 to 1997 and 2005 to 2007. From 1996 to 1998 Lecker was a member of the adjudication committee for the Canada-U.S. Fulbright Program, and in 1999 he was Chair of that committee.
Books and Articles.
Lecker is the author of eight books, which are all critical studies of either Canadian authors or theoretical problems related to the study and history of Canadian literature. Over the past 15 years he has focused on two areas in particular: canonicity in Canadian literature and anthology formation as a reflection of the evolution of literary value and taste. Lecker’s books in these areas are widely cited and have been adopted for use in Canadian studies courses across the country. Lecker is currently beginning work on a new study devoted to CBC's "Canada Reads" series and its role in contemporary Canadian canon formation. In addition to his book publications, Lecker has authored over 60 scholarly articles in journals and books in Canada, the US, and overseas, including "PMLA"," Critical Inquiry", "Canadian Literature", "Canadian Poetry", "Open Letter", "Studies in Canadian Literature", "Australasian Canadian Studies", and the "American Review of Canadian Studies".
"Keepers of the Code: English-Canadian Literary Anthologies and the Representation of Nation" (2013)
"Keepers of the Code" is the first book-length history of English-Canadian literary anthologies from 1837 to the present. Lecker aims to show that these anthologies, like all literature, are shaped by the conflict and contact among various individuals and institutions, including publishers, writers, reviewers, professors, tenure committees, funding agencies, critical journals, banks, and the bookselling industry. Lecker comments in detail on approximately 75 anthologies. Although there are scattered articles that focus on these questions in terms of English-Canadian anthologies, this is the first sustained historical study. The book was released in March 2013 and was positively reviewed in the "Times Literary Supplement".
"The Cadence of Civil Elegies" (2006)
Dennis Lee’s poem, "Civil Elegies", originally published in 1968 and revised in 1972, remains one of the most potent poems devoted to the nature of Canadian identity and civil space. In this study, Lecker shows us the poem’s importance to Canada’s literary canon, by emphasizing the new vision of Canada that Lee saw.
"Dr. Delicious: Memoirs of a Life in CanLit" (2006)
Lecker's tragicomic memoir, "Dr. Delicious", reviews his career as a publisher and editor of Canadian literature and criticism. The book is an irreverent history of an explosive era in Canadian literature, a glimpse into the mind of a preoccupied professor, and a unique record of the generation that made Canadian literature what it is today.
"English-Canadian Literary Anthologies: An Enumerative Bibliography" (1997)
"English-Canadian Literary Anthologies" is first detailed bibliography of Canadian anthologies from 1837 to the present. It lists approximately 2000 anthologies and is the departure point for any comprehensive commentary on anthology formation in Canada.
"Making It Real: The Canonization of English-Canadian Literature" (1995)
Eight wide-ranging essays are brought together in this study of the origins and development of Canadian literary canons. Lecker explores many of the myths surrounding the teaching, studying, publishing, and promotion of Canadian literature. He focuses on the work of Northrop Frye, Frank Davey, and the New Canadian Library series.
"An Other I: The Fictions of Clark Blaise" (1988)
"An Other I" is a study of the fiction of Clark Blaise.
"Robert Kroetsch" (1986)
"Robert Kroetsch" is a study of the poetry, fiction, and literary criticism of Robert Kroetsch.
"On the Line: Readings in the Short Fiction of Clark Blaise, John Metcalf, and Hugh Hood "(1982)
"On the Line" includes detailed readings of individual stories by three prominent Canadian writers.
Editorial Work.
Lecker edited the 24-volume series entitled "Canadian Writers and Their Works: Essays on Form, Context, and Development" with Jack David and Ellen Quigley. This 24-volume series comprises almost 10,000 pages of commentary on 100 Canadian writers from the nineteenth century to the present. Each author is treated in a discrete essay that provides a biography, a critical overview, a description of the writer's milieu, an analysis of each of the writer's works, and a bibliography of primary and secondary material. The volumes are organized chronologically so as to present a historical perspective. The editors coordinated the production of these essays by 100 scholars and released the existing series over a ten-year period.
Lecker was the senior editor for several multi-volume series published by Macmillan (New York) and G.K. Hall (Boston), including Masterworks and Critical Essays on World Literature. He was also the Canadian editor for Twayne’s World Authors Series. Lecker has edited numerous anthologies of Canadian literature from 1981 to the present, including one large anthology for HarperCollins in New York (the only anthology of Canadian literature published by a mainstream American publisher since 1943).
Robert Lecker Agency.
In 2004, Lecker established the Robert Lecker Agency in Montreal. The agency provides international literary representation, consulting services, and editorial services.

Nautel

Nautel Ltd. is a Canadian manufacturer of AM and FM radio broadcast transmitters, navigational radio beacons, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) transmitters, medium frequency (MF) telegraph and NAVTEX transmitters, and high frequency (HF) amplifiers for dielectric heating applications. Nautel is best known as the first company to develop a commercially available fully solid state broadcast transmitter. 
History.
Nautel was founded in 1969 in the rural community of Hackett's Cove, Nova Scotia. Its primary operation was building and supplying solid state navigation beacons for the Canadian government. To better serve the US market, Nautel Maine Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary located in Bangor, Maine, was founded in 1974.
Nautel delivered its first transmitter, a radio beacon for the Canadian government, in 1970. This was a fully solid state unit operating in the 190-535 kHz Aeronautical/Marine navigation band. These transmitters were the first ever commercially available solid state transmission devices, all transmitters up to this point having been of the tube variety. Because of the greater reliability and longevity of solid state transmitters many of these early models are still in use today.
The introduction of 10 kW and 50 kW solid state AM transmitters from Nautel in 1982 and 1985 was another first for the broadcast industry. The first 50 kW AM transmitter from Nautel was purchased by CBA (AM) in Moncton where it remained operational until April 8, 2008, when the station's AM signal was taken off the air. Although commonplace today, solid state transmitter technology was non-existent before Nautel entered the market. More than 20 years after being introduced, many of Nautel's first generation of AM transmitters can still be found operational and on the air at transmitter sites around the world. 
Nautel's introduction of solid state transmitter technology has had a large impact on the radio broadcast industry. As the benefits of solid state technology became clear, the industry began to shift away from the use of tube transmitters and began to adopt the more reliable and efficient solid state designs. By the early 1990s solid state transmitters were being widely used in radio broadcasting, while sales of vacuum tube transmitters began to decline. Since its inception in 1969 Nautel has focused solely on solid state broadcast technology with a lineup of 100% solid state radio transmitters at power levels ranging from 300 W to over 1000 kW.

Clinical clerkship

Clinical clerkships encompass a period of medical education in which students – medical, nursing, dental, or otherwise – practice medicine under the supervision of a health practitioner.
Medical clerkships.
For medical students, clerkships occur after the basic science curriculum, and are supervised by medical specialists at a teaching hospital or medical school. Typically, certain clerkships are required to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree or the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree in the United States (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics), while others are elective (e.g., dermatology, pathology, and neurology).
The intent of the clinical clerkship is to teach the medical student the fundamentals of clinical examination, evaluation, and care provision, and to enable the student to select the course of further study. During the clinical clerkship, the medical student will interact with real patients much as a physician does, but their evaluation and recommendations will be reviewed and approved by more senior physicians.

Edward Williams (painter)

Edward Williams (1781 – 24 June 1855) was an English landscape painter during the Victorian era. He had six sons, who were well-known landscape painters as well. Williams is considered the patriarch of the Williams family of painters, which is also referred to as the Barnes School.
Biography.
Life and career.
Although 1782 is usually given for his birth date, Edward Williams was actually born in 1781 in London, and baptized 13 October 1781 at St. Mary's Church in the Lambeth district. His mother Mary Ward was a sister of James Ward, the well-known animal painter, and a sister of the equally well-known engraver William Ward. She was also a sister-in-law of the brilliant figure painter George Morland, and a sister-in-law of Henry Chalon, another animal painter. His father, also named Edward Williams, was an engraver who worked with the master mezzotint engraver John Raphael Smith, and ran with a notorious group of drinkers that included the aforementioned George Morland, and Thomas Rowlandson the caricaturist. As such, the younger Williams grew up surrounded by artists, of whom Ward and Moreland were two the best-known painters in Georgian London.
Edward Williams, junior was sent around 1792 or 1793 to live with his maternal uncle James Ward, R.A. (1769–1859), but it seems unlikely that he received any painting instruction from him. Instead he was informally apprenticed to a carver and gilder named Thomas Hillier, who had a shop on Carnaby Street. Ultimately young Williams did become a painter, yet not a figure painter like his uncles, but a landscape painter, which, given his heritage is surprising as this was an age when landscape artists were considered inferior to figure painters. Although he never attained the fame of his uncles, he was nonetheless successful enough to enjoy a comfortable living. More important though, he fathered six sons, all artists like himself, who carried on the styles of landscape painting that he taught them, and some of whom were among the most popular landscape artists of the Victorian era.
Most of Edward Williams' life was spent in or near the artists quarter associated with Tottenham Court Road in London, until 1846 when he moved his family to 32 Castelnau Villas in rural Barnes, Surrey. There he, his wife, three of their children, and some of their grandchildren shared a large house, with a carriage house in back that became their studio. Three of his older sons eventually moved to nearby houses, some virtually next door, with only his oldest son Edward Charles Williams remaining in London. Here in Barnes, close to marshes of the Thames River, and near farm fields and wooded estates, the Williams family lived and worked in a communal artist setting. The hundreds of skillfully painted landscapes, all similar in subject and style, that flowed from their Barnes studios under the tutelage of Edward Williams gave rise to the popular attribution of the "Barnes School" of artists. However, they are most commonly referred to more simply as the "Williams family of painters".
Edward Williams between 1814 and 1855 exhibited at the Royal Academy (36 works), the British Institution (21 works), the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists (38 works), and elsewhere. He often shared venues with his sons, causing some confusion with the public who had trouble telling one Williams painting from another. He is often called ""Old Williams"" to distinguish him from his oldest son, and he is referred to in some of the art journals of the time as ""Moonight Williams"", as moonlit scenes of the Thames were one of his favorite subjects in his paintings. He was predeceased by his wife, and he is said to have never quite overcome the grief of her passing. He died on 24 June 1855 at the Castelnau Villas, and is buried nearby in the Old Barnes Cemetery.
Family.
Edward Williams was the son of the engraver Edward Williams (c.1755-1797?) and Mary Ward. He married Ann Hildebrandt (c.1780-1851) on 12 February 1806 in St Pancras, London, Ann being the daughter of Frederick and Sarah Hildebrandt. They had the eight children who follow. Three of Edward and Ann Williams' sons eventually changed their last name so that the public would not confuse their paintings with those of the rest of the family.
Art.
Style and influence.
Edward Williams probably began his art career making picture frames, but he was surrounded by relatives who were well-known painters and engravers, and over the years he reinvented himself as a painter. He started by painting miniatures, and copying Baroque landscapes from the 1600s in the style of the Dutch painters Ruisdael (1628-1682) and Hobbema (1638-1709) - the former known for woodland scenes with detailed renderings of trees, particularly the leaves, and water scenes with small boats moored beneath windmills; the latter known for his densely folliated trees with stippled leaves.
As Edward Williams developed his own style, he moved on to contemporary landscapes of the English countryside that, not surprisingly, hint of some of the work of his uncle George Morland. However, he became best known for moonlit scenes of boats and windmills along the Thames River, which earned him the epithet with the public of "Moonlight Williams", or simply the "moonlight painter". He rarely signed his work, perhaps but one painting in a hundred, and when he did he signed simply as "E.Wms." As a consequence, the work of "Old Williams" can be difficult at times to distinguish from that of his son Edward Charles Williams, who painted in a similar style and signed his paintings "E. Williams."
The Athenaeum on 14 July 1855 ran an obituary for Edward Williams in which they wrote, ""The name of Mr. E. Williams, the Elder, must be added to the year's obituary. This agreeable landscape painter died, we perceive, in the seventy-fourth year of his age . . . trained what must almost be called a school of landscape painters in his sons . . . whose works . . . do credit to him who trained them. His best landscapes (and none from his had were bad) may now rise in value among the collectors."" Edward Williams was a master at painting detailed country landscapes in which the figures, if present at all, were generally subordinate to the scenery, but he is perhaps best remembered for passing that style on to six sons, some of whom were among the most popular landscape painters of their time.

Dimo Hamaambo

Mweukefina Kulaumone Jerobeam Dimo Hamaambo (27 October, 1932 - 8 September, 2002) was a Namibian military commander in both the Namibian War of Independence as a SWAPO member and in independent Namibia as a high level commander in the Namibia Defence Force. 
Pre-military career.
Hamaambo was one of the thirteen children of his mother Josephina Melila Shipo and father Jona Hamaambo in Eengava, Ovamboland (now Ohangwena Region). After receiving some education in area schools, Hamaambo went to work outside of Ovamboland as a contract labourer on a White owned farm as well as a domestic worker, at a cannery in Walvis Bay and eventually in the gold mines of Johannesburg, South Africa. Hamaambo eventually returned to Namibia and joined the Ovamboland People's Organization (OPO), a predecessor of the SWAPO, at Walvis Bay in 1959. In 1960-61, Hamaambo attempted to leave the country via a boat leaving Lobito, Angola for the United Kingdom but was caught and returned to Namibia.
Exile.
Hamaambo finally went into exile in 1962 through Bechuanaland (now Botswana) and into Tanganyika (now Tanzania). From Tanzania, Hamaambo went for military training in newly independent Algeria and later the Soviet Union before becoming Second Deputy Army Commander of what was to become the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) in 1966, the year which began the Namibian War of Independence. Quickly rising through the ranks, Hamaambo become First Deputy in 1967 and Army Commander in 1968. He remained Army Commander of PLAN forces until PLAN's absorption into the new Namibia Defence Force in 1989. After PLAN's absorption, Hamaambo returned to Namibia prior to independence. Upon independence in March 1990, the PLAN veteran was named first Chief of Defence Forces, which lasted until his retirement in 2000 at the age 68. Hamaambo died in September 2002 and was the first person buried as a hero at Heroes' Acre, a war memorial south of Windhoek.

Operation Scheduled Departure

Operation Scheduled Departure was a 2008 project of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to organize the voluntary deportations of 457,000 eligible illegal immigrants from five U.S. cities. The goal was to benefit the government with a "quick, cheap" reduction in the fugitive count, and to save money by not having to keep immigrants in detention centers.
Operation.
The operation was first announced on a Univision Sunday news program and formally began on August 5 and ended on August 22. The five targeted cities were Charlotte, North Carolina, Chicago, Illinois, Santa Ana, California (Los Angeles area), Phoenix, Arizona, and San Diego, California. Illegal immigrants who ignored a deportation order ("fugitives") and didn't have a criminal record could walk into an ICE office and agree to be deported. They would be given 90 days to make arrangements for their U.S. born children. Of the 457,000 fugitives eligible for the program, 8 volunteered to be deported.

Marie Brenner (born 1949) is an American author, investigative journalist and writer-at-large for "Vanity Fair". She has also written for "New York", "The New Yorker" and the "Boston Herald" and has taught at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Her "Vanity Fair" article on tobacco insider Jeffrey Wigand, "The Man Who Knew Too Much", inspired the 1999 movie "The Insider", starring Russell Crowe and Al Pacino.
Personal.
Marie Harriet Brenner was born in San Antonio, Texas to Milton and Thelma Brenner. She grew up in San Antonio and moved to New York in 1970.
Her father was chairman of Solo Serve Corporation, a chain of Texas discount stores started by her grandfather Isidor Brenner, who emigrated from Mexico to Texas during the Mexican Revolution.
She is the niece of Anita Brenner, anthropologist and author of "Idols Behind Alters", published in 1929. Anita was a member of the circle of Mexican muralists and artists, Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Edward Weston and Tina Modotti, who flourished in Mexico in the 1920s and was widely credited with helping to introduce their work in the United States. One of the first women to be a regular contributor to
"The New York Times", Anita Brenner once interviewed Leon Trotsky, the deposed leader of the Russian Revolution and was an authority on Mexico and Latin American affairs.
She had an older brother Carl, a lawyer turned apple farmer who was the focus of her memoir, "Apples and Oranges: My Brother and Me, Lost and Found." 
Career.
Brenner earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Texas at Austin and received a M.A. from New York University Film School. She was the first female baseball columnist covering the American League, traveling with the Boston Red Sox for the Boston Herald during the 1979 season.
Brenner worked as a contributing editor for ""New York" (magazine)" from 1980–1984, and covered the Royal Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer.
Brenner joined "Vanity Fair" as a special correspondent in 1984. She left the magazine in 1992 to become a staff writer at "The New Yorker", returning to Vanity Fair in 1995 as writer-at-large.
Her explosive 1996 article for "Vanity Fair" on Jeffrey Wigand and the tobacco wars, titled "The Man Who Knew Too Much" was made into the 1999 feature film "The Insider", starring Russell Crowe and Al Pacino, and directed by Michael Mann. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
Brenner's 2002 "Vanity Fair" article, "The Enron Wars," delving into the investigation into the Enron scandals made national news when Senator Peter Fitzgerald used it to question witnesses testifying before a senate committee.
An archive of Brenner's work is stored at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.
In 2009, the Manhattan Theater Club announced that it had commissioned Alfred Uhry to adapt Brenner's memoir "Apples and Oranges: My Brother and Me, Lost and Found" for the stage.

Songs for Survival

"Bruce Parry Presents Amazon - Tribe - Songs for Survival" is a double album released by Kensaltown Records in support of a tribal peoples charity.
Background.
The album was released in support of Survival International, the human rights organisation for tribal peoples. The themes of the album are life around the Amazon River and other remote tribal areas. These topics are covered in the Bruce Parry television series "Tribe" and "Amazon". All of the music on the album is exclusive and was written for the project. Many of the songs on the record contain samples recorded by Bruce Parry whilst living with tribal communities. The first track on the album by supergroup Apparatjik was used for the credits roll on the BBC series "Amazon with Bruce Parry".
The album was released digitally on 15 September 2008, which was also the debut of the "Amazon" series on BBC 2, and then on 13 October on CD. It is available from retailers such as iTunes, Play.com and Amazon.co.uk.
Every track on the album is exclusive, and has been written especially for the project. Around £45,000 has been raised for Survival International through album purchases.
The album was put together by Molly Oldfield, daughter of musician Mike Oldfield. She and Bruce Parry took samples from all the tribes (taken from BBC's "Tribe") and sent them all the musicians involved on the project. Each one chose their favourite sample around which to write a song. Other musicians preferred to write a straightforward song without using the samples but all are inspired by the issues facing indigenous communities all over the world. The first track to be received was by Hot Chip (Molly was at Oxford University with Joe Goddard) who sampled music from the Babongo tribe in Gabon, Africa. Mike Oldfield's "Song for Survival" was composed in 2007, he sampled the islanders of Anuta singing in church, this was the second track to be received for the project.
Apparatjik.
"Ferreting", the theme to "Amazon", is performed by Apparatjik, a supergroup composed of Guy Berryman, Magne Furuholmen, Jonas Bjerre (of Coldplay, a-ha and Mew respectively) and Martin Terefe.

If customers find a lower price, Road Runner Sports will match it. Lastly, VIP members save 10 percent on everything all year long, and a Warp Speed Promise that an order is on its way within two hours from the time it is placed.
History.
In the early days of Road Runner Sports, the atmosphere was much different than it is today. Gotfredson sold his first pair of running shoes out of his garage. On the first day of business, a lone Running Specialist sold seven pairs of shoes, writing each order by hand on credit card forms. He individually phoned in each charge for authorization and shipped out the orders with handwritten mailing labels from his small Del Mar, California garage with no computers or technology perks. Checking inventory required that same sales representative to open the warehouse door and ask, “Do we have any Excalibur in a size 9?” Work stopped when a shipment of shoes arrived. Out the door went the entire staff to check in the 100 or so pairs of shoes rolling off the truck.
Today.
Over the years, Road Runner Sports has grown from its beginnings in that Del Mar garage to having distribution centers in San Diego, California and Columbus, Ohio, plus 30 (and counting) retail stores coast to coast.
Brick and mortar locations are placed in areas targeting existing independently owned running specialty stores. Stores are located within close proximity to independent retailers in order to benefit from their existing customers. The running store’s retail locations include Tempe and Scottsdale, Arizona; Campbell, Carlsbad, Concord, Costa Mesa, San Carlos, Laguna Hills, San Diego, Santa Monica and Studio City (coming 2013), Thousand Oaks, Torrance, and West Hills, California; Westminster, Colorado; Atlanta and Marietta, Georgia; Chicago, Naperville, Kildeer, and Wilmette, Illinois; Columbia, Maryland; North Brunswick, Paramus, Shrewsbury, New Jersey; Tualatin, Portland (coming 2013), Oregon; Columbus, Ohio; Falls Church, Virginia; Kent, Seattle, and Bellevue, Washington with more opening year after year. Many of these Road Runner Sports stores have opened in areas where a small, independent running specialty shop exists and has successfully been in business for years. These locations are sometimes as close as a quarter of a mile away from existing independent local shops.
Road Runner Sports offers running and walking apparel, gear and shoes, including Brooks, adidas, ASICS, Nike, New Balance, Saucony, Puma, Vibram and more.

Forever Activists

Forever Activists: Stories from the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade is a 1990 documentary film by Connie Field and Judith Montell that shares interviews with seven American veterans of the Spanish Civil War who fought for the Loyalist cause during the war and went on to live lives of activism. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.
Summary.
The film makes the point that for many of the men and women who fought in the Spanish Civil War it was just one of a series of continuing social struggles that they believed in.
The scene-setting material (old newsreel clips) is familiar, but veterans' faces and their stories seem ever new and raw, even when it is apparent that the same tales have been told many times before. All of those who testify are creatures of the Great Depression, idealistic and dedicated to improving the lot of the people President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed as his fellow Americans.
The film's highlight is a reunion of the veterans in Spain in 1986, on the 50th anniversary of the war's outbreak. It looks to have been both a picnic and a time for summing up. Yet the film's most moving moments come when the veterans recall their treatment when they went home after the war.
Passports were revoked, and for many their membership in the brigade was to cost them jobs and reputations for decades to come. Most, it seems, absorbed the shocks and went on to fight on behalf of labor, civil rights and the peace movement during the Vietnam War.

NewHolly (formerly Holly Park) is a neighborhood in southeast Seattle, Washington, USA.
Holly Park was built in the 1940s to house defense workers and veterans, but in the 1950s, it was converted into public housing under the aegis of the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA). As the mid-century style of low-income housing projects fell out of fashion, and with its housing stock not faring well over the decades, SHA decided in 1995 to rebuild Holly Park as a mixed-income neighborhood. The resulting neighborhood is now officially NewHolly, described by the SHA as "the first new neighborhood in Seattle in 50 years."
NewHolly consists primarily of housing, but also includes a learning center; a branch of Seattle Public Library; several classrooms attached to South Seattle Community College; a Head Start preschool; child care, youth, family, and teen programs; and community-building activities and employment programs intended to help residents obtain and secure living-wage jobs.
South Seattle Community College's NewHolly Learning Center teaches ESL and family literacy, ABE/GED preparation, and a worker retraining program associated with Community Corrections and Protective Service.

Juanita Cruz is a novel written by Magdalena G. Jalandoni in 1966. It was originally written in Hiligaynon.
Plot.
Juanita Cruz or Nita, is the only daughter of Don Macario and Dona Beatriz, one of the most affluent families from the town of Salog (at present, known as Jaro) in the province of Iloilo. Her friendship with Lina, a daughter of a poor family opened her eyes to see the disparity between the rich and the poor. As a child, the early demise of Lina gave Nita her first heartache. 
Nita was sheltered and pampered as she grows. She is considered the binukot, the untouched princess, of her rich and powerful family. Her fate started to change when she met the already fine man named Elias, the only brother of her friend Lina. Since Elias’ family belongs to a lower social status, Nita’s parents and brothers- Edgar and Chito, are against their relationship. 
The day before Elias leaves the country to study in Spain under a scholarship grant, the lovers secretly met in a garden. Unfortunately, they were caught by Don Macario and Dona Beatriz. Soon, Nita’s position in her family was replaced by her cousin Mila. Later on, Nita could no longer bear her sufferings that she decided to leave their house and found herself challenged by the waves of fate that would have drowned her in uncharted depths of the ocean. 
Since then, Nita went on a journey in pursuit of her passions in life. She remained single until she finally met Elias-the man of her dreams, again. The love story of Nita and Elias ended with the death of Elias as one of the high-ranking officers of the revolutionary army against the Spanish colonizers.

<doc id="19027360" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19027360" title="Hurricane Gustav">
Hurricane Gustav

Hurricane Gustav was the second most destructive hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm was the seventh tropical cyclone, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season. Gustav caused serious damage and casualties in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Cuba and the United States. Gustav caused at least $6.6 billion (2008 USD) in damages.
It formed on the morning of August 25, 2008, about southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm that afternoon and into a hurricane early on August 26. Later that day it made landfall near the Haitian town of Jacmel. It inundated Jamaica and ravaged Western Cuba and then steadily moved across the Gulf of Mexico.
Once into the Gulf, Gustav gradually weakened because of increased wind shear and dry air. It weakened to a Category 2 hurricane late on August 31, and remained at that intensity until landfall on the morning of September 1 near Cocodrie, Louisiana. Weakening continued, and Gustav weakened to a tropical storm that evening and to a tropical depression the next day as it meandered around the south-central US. The weak system became extratropical on September 4 and was absorbed by another low on September 5.
In total, an estimated 153 deaths had been attributed to Gustav in the U.S. and Caribbean. Damage in the U.S. totaled to $4.3 billion (2008 USD) with additional damage of $2.1 billion in Cuba and $210 million in damage in Jamaica.
Meteorological history.
Gustav formed out of a tropical wave that had previously produced t-rain and squalls in the Lesser Antilles. It developed well-defined curved bands and briefly exhibited an upper-level eye feature. The NHC designated it Tropical Depression Seven and dispatched a hurricane hunter aircraft to investigate the system. At the time, the system had a well-defined outflow in all but the southeast and southwest quadrant,
and data from the hurricane-hunter aircraft confirmed that the tropical depression had strengthened into a tropical storm, which was soon designated Tropical Storm Gustav.
A brief period of disorganization
proved to be temporary as a well-defined eye wall formed that same night.
In the early hours of August 26, as the storm approached Haiti's southwestern peninsula,
another hurricane hunter aircraft confirmed what forecasters already suspected—that Gustav had strengthened into a hurricane with winds topping 90 mph (150 km/h).
Before reaching Haiti, its satellite presentation continued to intensify, a central dense overcast became more prominent,
and the minimum central pressure fell.
Hurricane Gustav regained a pronounced eye as it made landfall on Haiti, with winds,
near the town of Jacmel.
As the hurricane moved over Haiti's mountainous terrain its circulation was disrupted and it lost a little strength.
Although downgraded to a tropical storm, it still had a pronounced eye in its mid- and upper-level structures. Its outflow improved throughout the night of August 26,
and the system was not very disrupted when it moved back over water into the Gulf of Gonâve.
However, the storm's movement slowed, and continued interaction with nearby Haiti, combined with the incursion of mid-level dry air from the northeast, resulted in further weakening during the day on August 27.
The storm began a west-southwesterly movement that brought it closer to Jamaica. On the morning of August 28 it was found that, overnight, Gustav had either reformed farther to the south or had moved farther to the south than previously thought. The storm was also found to have restrengthened nearly to hurricane status.
It then was upgraded to a hurricane again during the late afternoon of August 29. At 11:00 a.m EDT (1500 UTC) on August 30, as Gustav neared the west end of Cuba, it was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale,
with sustained winds near 125 mph (205 km/h). Gustav continued its rapid deepening trend, and three hours later, it had already reached Category 4 strength. Gustav's maximum sustained winds had reached 155 mph (250 km/h)
with a minimum pressure of 941 millibars.
On August 30 Gustav made landfall twice on Cuba: first, on Isla de la Juventud and then on the mainland near the community of Los Palacios in Pinar del Río Province. By the early hours of August 31, Gustav entered the Gulf of Mexico with maximum sustained winds of and minimum central pressure of 958 millibars.
During August 31, the storm moved in a northwest direction slightly losing its strength (despite passing over a shortened Loop Current) with sustained winds at 115 mph. On the evening of August 31, Gustav weakened to a Category 2 hurricane and remained at such intensity until landfall. Gustav made landfall along the Louisiana coast with 105 mph (170 km/h) winds near Cocodrie, at about 9:30 a.m CDT (1430 UTC). By 10 pm CDT, Gustav had been downgraded to a Tropical Storm with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) about 20 miles (30 km) southwest of Alexandria, Louisiana and by 4 am CDT on September 2 Gustav had diminished to a Tropical Depression with a threat of severe flooding in the lower Mississippi Valley and eastern Texas.

Immediately upon the storm's designation as a tropical depression it was expected to strengthen into a tropical storm and strike the island of Hispaniola, shared by the Dominican Republic on the east and Haiti on the west. Tropical storm warnings were issued from the coast of the Dominican Republic south of Santo Domingo to the Haitian coast south of Port-au-Prince. A tropical storm watch was issued for the Haitian coast, north of Port-au-Prince to the northern border with the Dominican Republic. Hours later, when Gustav was upgraded to a tropical storm, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the tropical storm watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning.
The Haitian government ordered emergency shelters to prepare. The country is particularly vulnerable to floods and landslides as rainfall runs off its largely deforested mountains. The government issued a red alert and advised the population to take precautions, but few Haitians took heed. Fair weather led many to doubt whether a hurricane was even approaching. American Airlines canceled all of its flights into and out of Port-au-Prince on August 26, stranding travelers hoping to escape the storm.
Jamaica and Cayman Islands.
On August 25, Carnival Cruise Lines diverted one of its ships from Montego Bay, Jamaica, to Mexico in order to avoid the storm. Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) readied response systems in anticipation of Hurricane Gustav affecting the island.
In the Cayman Islands, a hurricane watch was issued at 6 pm August 25 and upgraded that to a warning on 6 pm August 27. Banks and non-essential government services were closed Friday to allow residents to prepare. Extra flights were organized to get tourists off the island and, per usual practice, further visits were banned until the All Clear was given. Stores and gas stations were busy and each district office offered free plywood to protect windows and residents hurried about to secure their business interests and property.
Cuba.
60,000 were evacuated overnight on August 29 from Cuba's western coasts. Gustav was projected to strike Cuba on the afternoon of August 30. Additional evacuations were ordered on the afternoon of August 30 as Gustav strengthened to a strong Category 4 hurricane, particularly in the low-lying Pinar del Río Province where 190,000 were evacuated. On Monday, September 1, Cuban officials reported that Gustav's winds damaged or destroyed 90,000 homes in Pinar del Río, and knocked down 80 high-tension towers. The combined damage estimate from Gustav and the subsequent hurricanes Ike and Paloma is about $9.4 billion (USD), with about 2.1 billion of that from Gustav.
United States.
On August 31, the NHC predicted with 45% probability that Gustav would remain at Category 3 or above on September 1. This influenced preparations, although in fact Gustav had dropped just below the Category 3 threshold to Category 2 by landfall, and Category 1 shortly afterwards.
Louisiana.
On the morning of August 26, with Gustav still over Haiti, Louisiana emergency preparedness officials met several times to discuss predictions that Gustav would reach the state as a major hurricane in three to five days. Several areas of Louisiana planned for evacuations. Several parishes in the New Orleans area announced plans for voluntary evacuations beginning Saturday, August 30. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin said that it was possible thousands of people who need city help could start leaving on Saturday, as the first wave of a full-scale evacuation. Later, he ordered the mandatory evacuation of the whole of New Orleans commencing on the morning of August 31, calling Gustav "the storm of the century ... the mother of all storms." On August 31, Nagin also declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew and the cessation of city assistance in evacuations by the afternoon. By that afternoon, 1.9 million people had evacuated southern Louisiana, with 200,000 being residents of New Orleans alone, making it the largest evacuation in the history of Louisiana.
Officials had finalized evacuation plans, which proposed assisted evacuations as early as August 29: Contraflow lane reversal on all major highways, and 700 buses to help move evacuees. For those evacuees in need of shelter, the state government secured tens of thousands of shelter beds. Wary of repeating the mistakes of Hurricane Katrina, authorities chose not to use the Louisiana Superdome and New Orleans Convention Center as emergency shelters. The following day, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency, activating between 3,000 and 8,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard.
Mayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin shortened his appearance at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, to assist in preparations. The residents of low-lying Grand Isle, Louisiana, were under a voluntary evacuation order beginning August 29. Traditionally, the community is one of the first to vacate when tropical storms threaten. Residents of lower Cameron Parish, Louisiana, were also given a voluntary evacuation order on August 29. Mandatory evacuation orders have since been given. In Plaquemines Parish, Parish President Billy Nungesser flew in a helicopter counting the number of vessels and barges that potentially would be a safety issue to people, property, and the levee system during a hurricane. Parish officials called the owners of about 150 vessels and told them to move the vessels or the parish would sink them. 70 of the 150 were sunk, some by the parish, some by the owners. [http://www.wwltv.com/topstories/stories/wwl091608mlplaq.82dc39c1.html] Also, parish officials started a last-ditch effort to save Belle Chasse by constructing a sand levee across Louisiana Highway 23. Approximately eight hours later, the parish government announced the completion of the levee.
The Mississippi River was shut to all ship traffic between the Gulf of Mexico and New Orleans on August 30. Pilots at Lake Charles in west Louisiana, and Sabine Pass in east Texas, also were making plans as of August 30 to halt traffic. Tulane University, Loyola University New Orleans, the University of New Orleans, and Xavier University of Louisiana all closed their campuses for the entire week but resumed classes on the following Monday of September 8, 2008. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette also canceled classes for September 2 and 3, as did Louisiana State University and Baton Rouge Community College.
On September 1, Plaquemines Parish officials asked the residents of Braithwaite, Louisiana to leave, as levee failure was considered imminent. FEMA had estimated there were only about 10,000 people left in New Orleans on September 1.
Local events.
One major sporting event was directly affected by the disaster preparations. On August 30, Louisiana State University (LSU) opened its 2008 football season against Appalachian State. The originally scheduled kickoff time of 4 pm CDT would have conflicted with the start of contraflow lane reversal, and Interstate 10 is a key evacuation route through Baton Rouge. Accordingly, LSU moved kickoff to 10 am CDT. A college football game between Nicholls State University and New Mexico State University, scheduled for September 4, was canceled. The Triple-A baseball New Orleans Zephyrs cancelled the final three games of their season because of the impending approach of Gustav and evacuation preparations. The New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL) proceeded with plans to evacuate from New Orleans and headed to Indianapolis, where they practiced at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Saints returned to New Orleans to play their first home game as scheduled on Sunday, September 7, defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24–20.
Hotel and business closures related to Gustav had impact on New Orleans' Southern Decadence celebrations, which were scheduled for August 27 through September 1, 2008.
After the lessons from Katrina the main hospitals remained open. Non critical patients were evacuated but serious cases remained with full support. As an example Tulane had installed an independent power system. This allowed them to continue critical care. At the height of the crisis only 4 patients remained in ICU but had full support, even to the extent that a liver transplant was successfully performed during Gustav.
Texas.
Texas Governor Rick Perry activated 5,000 members of the Texas Military Forces on August 29 in response to the possible crisis, in addition to preparations made by other agencies. As of August 29, other preparations in Texas to deal with Gustav and its effects were implemented. Some evacuees were being placed in Northeast Texas, including in Dallas County, Tarrant County, and Tyler, Texas.
In Harris County, Texas, Judge Ed Emmett said that the Reliant Astrodome will not be used as a shelter for evacuees if Hurricane Gustav hits New Orleans, because Houston is also vulnerable to Hurricane Gustav; according to Emmett, it would make more sense to evacuate to a more inland area.
Voluntary evacuations of Jefferson and Orange Counties started on August 30 with mandatory evacuations in the two counties started on August 31. Also, the Texas Governor deployed other assets to help handle the oncoming disaster.
Mississippi and Alabama.
On August 27, requests and orders began for evacuations along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. All schools in Harrison County's five public school districts were closed until September 2. Several schools in Pearl River County were also confirmed closed until September 2. The University of Southern Mississippi was closed on September 2, as well as the Alcorn State University.
Much of the Alabama National Guard was mobilized to assist evacuees from the other states. Governor Bob Riley called for mandatory evacuation of Dauphin Island, Plash Island, Gulf Shores, as well as everything south of Fort Morgan Road, Gulf Shores on August 31. The Mobile Regional Airport closed on August 31, and remained closed September 1. It is reopened September 2. The Bankhead Tunnel in Mobile, Alabama, closed on August 31. WARN systems are agreements between rural water associations and government agencies in neighboring states that coordinate the response to large water emergencies. Water technicians and trailers of portable generators, pumps, spare parts and testing equipment were readied along the gulf coast and neighboring states to respond to the emergency.
Impact.
Operationally, Gustav went from a tropical depression to a hurricane in 14 hours, tying Hurricane Humberto's record of 14 hours, although this may be disputed in post-season analysis.
In the aftermath, the Canadian government sent a C-17 airlifter, with a medical team, from CFB Trenton to assist in the evacuation of New Orleans. and two C-130 Hercules airlift planes from Greenwood, Nova Scotia and from Winnipeg, Manitoba. The United Kingdom sent HMS "Iron Duke" and RFA "Wave Ruler" to provide emergency assistance and assess the damage caused by Gustav. Anheuser-Busch provided canned water to affected residents. Russia announced it would send 4 cargo planes with tents, construction materials, food, and essential supplies to Cuba.
Hispaniola.
In the Dominican Republic, a landslide in a rural area killed eight people. Two people were injured. Government authorities said that some 67,255 persons were evacuated and more than 1,239 homes were damaged with 12 destroyed. 50 communities were isolated by the flooding.
Gustav made landfall in Haiti at approximately 1 pm EDT on August 26, about 10 miles (16 km) west of the city of Jacmel. While inland, Gustav's rains triggered a landslide in the community of Benet which killed one person. Two more were killed in southwestern Haiti when their house collapsed. Another two deaths were caused by an explosion inside a house, thought to be possibly related to Hurricane Gustav. The southern town of Jacmel, where the hurricane made landfall, was bisected by floodwaters.
According to Haiti's National Director of Civil Protection, 77 people died as a result of the hurricane. Some 2,100 houses were destroyed and another 8,150 damaged, causing an estimated 7,200 people to live in temporary shelters, including churches, community centers and schools.
Jamaica.
In Jamaica, 15 deaths were reported after Gustav swept through the area as a tropical storm. Flash flooding was also reported on the island as a result of Gustav's heavy rains.
The banana sector in the parishes of St. Thomas, St. Mary and Portland suffered significant damage.
The Hope River Bridge linking the capital Kingston with the eastern reaches of the city including Harbour View and St. Thomas collapsed and the Georgia bridge in Portland was destroyed. Jamaica's government ministry initially estimated US$41.8 million in damage to the road infrastructure in the country. Total damage in Jamaica was estimated at $210 million.
Cayman Islands.
In the Cayman Islands, Gustav's heavy rains and storm surge flooded the streets of Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, the smaller easternmost "Sister Islands" in the chain. More than 1,100 people spent the night in government shelters in the three islands as high waves and heavy winds battered the chain, the National Emergency Operations Center said in a statement. Most people waited out the storm in private homes or hotels.
Cuba.
On Saturday August 30, 2008, Gustav made landfall on mainland Cuba near the community of Los Palacios in Pinar del Río—a region that produces much of the tobacco used to make the nation's famed cigars. In Los Palacios some 7,000 homes were roofless and many with their walls collapsed. The rice and banana farms sustained much damage.
At least 300,000 people were evacuated from Gustav's path as 140 mph (220 km/h) winds toppled telephone poles and fruit trees, shattered windows and tore off the tin roofs of homes. Cuban authorities declared that Gustav is the worst hurricane to hit the country in 50 years. Authorities called the storm damage the worst since 1956. The 211 mph (341 km/h) wind gusts registered in the city of Paso Real de San Diego were the highest in Cuba's history, according to the provincial newspaper, the "Guerrillero". Winds were so strong that the weather station instruments broke. Gustav is considered Cuba's worst hurricane in 45 years, the last hurricane that was worse than Gustav for Cuba was Hurricane Flora in 1963, which was the deadliest Cuban storm since the 1932 Cuba Hurricane.
Cuban Civil defense authorities initially stated that there were "many people injured" on Isla de la Juventud, an island of 87,000 people south of the mainland. Nearly all the island's roads were washed out and some regions were heavily flooded. No fatalities have been reported in Cuba, despite the extreme damage.
By September 3, Cuba's President Raul Castro said that 20,000 of the 25,000 houses on Isla de la Juventud were damaged. More than 90,000 homes were damaged in the western province of Pinar del Río according to government news agency AIN. 3,306 tobacco houses were destroyed, with 906 tons of tobacco leaves wet. More than of crops were ruined, including of grain and nearly 1,500 of fruit. 42,000 cans of coffee were destroyed, and 3,100 tons of grapefruit lost. 930,000 chickens had to be euthanized.
According to Pinar del Río civil defense authorities, 86,000 homes were damaged, 80 electric towers and 600 electric posts fell. Cuba's electric company, indicated that a total of 136 electric towers toppled over and that the electrical grid on Isla de la Juventud was 100% damaged. In all, damage from Hurricane Gustav totaled $2.1 billion in Cuba.
United States.
Although the storm was still in its formative stages on August 26, fears that Hurricane Gustav might eventually disrupt oil production in the Gulf of Mexico caused oil prices to rise. On August 27, U.S. oil and natural-gas companies began evacuating personnel from their oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico amid continued forecasts that Gustav would strengthen and move into the gulf. By August 30, 76.77% of oil production and 37.16% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico had been shut in. By mid-day August 31, 96% of oil production had stopped. Out at sea, one death was reported. Sunk in the Gulf as an artificial reef in 2004, the USS Oriskany (CV/CVA-34) shifted and was buried 10 feet deeper in the ocean floor after Gustav passed over.
Louisiana.
In the state of Louisiana, 34 parishes were declared as disaster areas.
Hurricane Gustav reached the Louisiana coast on the morning of September 1, making landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana ("see rainfall map"); however, at 9 am wind speed at Grand Isle had been 115 mph ( km/h), the highest eyewall speed, indicating the eyewall had traveled over 4 hours along the coast. The center of the storm continued northwest across the state, so damage and deaths were widespread in many areas.
48 deaths in the state of Louisiana were blamed on Hurricane Gustav. Five were due to falling trees, two due to a tornado and the rest were indirect deaths.
After Gustav weakened to a tropical depression, several tornadoes were spawned including one (rated EF2) that killed two near Mamou during the early hours of September 3. The tornado also injured two others.
In Baton Rouge, wind damage from Gustav was the worst of any storm in memory. The damage was severe enough to effectively shut the city down for over a week. While most residents chose not to evacuate further inland due to the minuscule threat of major flooding, large numbers of people fled the city after the storm due to the crippled power system in the city. Because most storms dissipate to below tropical-storm levels by the time they reach Baton Rouge, many trees that survived weaker storms in the past fell onto homes, cars, and power lines. In many of the more heavily wooded sections of Baton Rouge, large trees and fallen power lines blocked streets, causing relief to come slowly to those living in residential areas. Nearly all businesses remained closed through September 5, five days after landfall. Power lines along Baton Rouge's tree-lined streets were easily brought down as thousands of trees were uprooted and snapped in half by Gustav's fierce winds. Entire sections of the city were cut off by the mountains of debris. Few homes escaped roof damage as the storm passed over the capital city. Most schools were closed for at least one week, and many for two or three while power was restored to the area around the school. Many signs were blown down, including a large portion of the Interstate 10 Highland Road/Nicholson Drive exit sign, which blew off of the Bridge and into the Mississippi River. It would be three weeks before power was restored to all residents. Debris cleanup was still ongoing at the end of 2008, four months after the storm had passed.
Around 1.5 million people were without power in Louisiana on September 1.
The state reported about 100,000 people remained on the coast, after evacuation. Nearly 2 million people had evacuated from south Louisiana in the days before Gustav's arrival.
The city of New Orleans had the official reopening date on Thursday (Sept. 4), after crews had restored most electric power and other services.
Damage assessments came as residents returned to inspect their properties. Damage included numerous trees down in various locations, such as around some Marriott hotels, and large tree limbs were broken from oak trees along St. Charles Avenue. Millions of smaller branches were scattered throughout neighborhoods, blown by the strong winds. Area hotels planned to reopen the week of September 8, some by Saturday, September 6 (such as the InterContinental & 16 area Marriotts, which already had electricity restored).
The Associated Press reported on the floodwall along the Industrial Canal (the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal), which connects Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River, and is susceptible to surges via the Gulf Outlet. High water splashed over the floodwalls onto new splash guards (designed to prevent foundation erosion), but the walls were not breached. Minor street flooding began in the upper Ninth Ward of New Orleans.
The community of Houma, Louisiana and the surrounding area in south-central Louisiana sustained extensive wind damage. The winds blew off many roofs, blew windows out of houses and knocked down many trees and left much of the region without power. Shingles and awnings were scattered throughout downtown Houma. At Ellender High in Houma, the school's new gym was heavily damaged, with a rear wall collapsed. The roof of the Houma-Terrebonne Chamber of Commerce was also blown away. Overall, the area was considered to have dodged a bullet. Had the storm come ashore farther west, the Intracoastal Waterway would have been a highway for storm surge to penetrate into the heart of Houma. However, flooding was relatively minor in the region.
Central Louisiana was also hard hit. Many trees and power lines were knocked down in that region as well, and many houses sustained damage from the winds and localized flooding. Part of the roof at the Alexandria Mall collapsed. Two people died in the region — one was electrocuted and one had a tree crush her trailer. The area's water supply was also hampered as power was knocked out to most of the water wells in the Alexandria and Pineville areas.
Damage and significant power outages were reported as far north as northern Louisiana, in the Interstate 20 corridor. Highest rainfall totals received thus far across the state include near Bunkie, Louisiana, and at Barataria Bay Pass.
President Bush declared 34 Louisiana parishes as disaster areas and visited the area on September 3.
On Wednesday, September 3, field staff and emergency supplies from the Arkansas Rural Water Association departed to assist the Louisiana Rural Water Association restore water and wastewater service to impacted communities. Staff and supplies from other state associations, including Alabama, Mississippi and Florida went on stand-by the same day. By Friday, September 5, response teams from Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi were assisting efforts to restore water and wastewater service. There was little structural damage to the water infrastructure, with power loss the primary difficulty. Rural water teams provided 771 on-site technical assistance visits to 370 affected water and wastewater systems. Later, the LRWA efforts received applause from the Louisiana Joint Select Committee on Homeland Security.
The LSU football team postponed their game, scheduled for September 6, against Troy University and rescheduled it for November 15 after damage was caused to Tiger Stadium. The swirling wind in the stadium tore awnings, threw team benches from the sidelines of the playing field into the stands and littered the stadium with debris.
Mississippi and Alabama.
The National Weather Service reported 14 confirmed tornadoes spun by Gustav from Biloxi to Mobile. All during September 1, numerous tornado warnings (more than 100) were issued from Mobile all the way to Natchez, Mississippi, based on radar-rotation patterns that indicated strong circulating winds.
In Mississippi, damage from Gustav was far less severe than that caused by Hurricane Katrina, with its 2005 storm surge of 27 ft (7 m); however, Gustav's storm surge was high as 15 feet (4.5 m) in places on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Sections of U.S. Route 90 (including Gulfport and Biloxi) were flooded and some houses were flooded. Two people from Metairie, Louisiana died near Vicksburg in an automobile accident while evacuating from the storm.
In Alabama, scattered damage already reached multi-million dollar levels, with the destruction of the Dauphin Island berm (sand dune barrier) by storm surge waves, flood damage to island roads & homes, and extensive flooding around Bayou La Batre. The manmade sand berm took about two years to complete, and there is no official plan yet to construct another berm for Dauphin Island, which acts as a barrier island for the western Alabama coastline at Mobile Bay.
A fuller assessment of damage can be expected when more residents return to the coastal areas and further insurance claims are filed.
Florida.
The state of Florida was affected by both the Cuba landfall, with Gustav traveling past the Florida Keys, and the Louisiana landfall (September 1), affecting the Florida panhandle, with storm surge and outer band tornadoes and thunderstorms. Several tornado warnings were issued around the Pensacola area. Panhandle beaches had rip currents, and officials in Pensacola Beach had been passing out pamphlets warning of deadly rip currents that could continue for days. Four people died in rip currents on Florida beaches.
The "USS Oriskany", now an artificial reef off the coast of Pensacola, shifted 10 feet deeper leaving the flight deck at following Gustav.
Four people died in a car accident on Interstate 20 near Carrollton, Georgia while evacuating from Louisiana. Two other people in the car were alive and airlifted to nearby hospitals.
Arkansas.
Because of Gustav's slow motion across northwest Louisiana and Arkansas on September 4 and September 5, significant rainfall accumulation was seen statewide. The maximum amount in Arkansas was at Hamburg, where had fallen,
making Gustav the third wettest tropical cyclone to affect the state since 1972.
Texas.
Especially affected was the small southeast Texas coastal town of Bridge City where nearly the entire town received heavy water damage.
Political implications.
United States.
Hurricane Gustav was expected to make landfall near New Orleans almost exactly three years after Hurricane Katrina struck the same region. It also arrived in the midst of the campaign for the 2008 U.S. presidential elections and during the week the 2008 Republican National Convention was scheduled to start. The federal and state administrations, as well as the candidates for the 2008 presidential election were sensitive that Gustav was likely to remind U.S. voters of the "botched response" by state and local municipalities and subsequent federal aid authorities to the earlier storm.
On August 30, President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney canceled their planned attendance at the 2008 Republican National Convention. Because of the expected U.S. landfall, governors and some other political leaders from Louisiana and other states chose to stay home from the 2008 Republican National Convention. As the hurricane approached the coast, presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain canceled all non-essential opening-day festivities at the convention and said that he might give his acceptance speech via satellite from the affected area.
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and Vice Presidential nominee Joe Biden, monitoring the situation in the Gulf Coast, encouraged New Orleans residents to evacuate. Obama also announced that he would ask his large network of donors and volunteers to contribute money, goods and work to assist victims of the storm according to what was most needed after the storm hit.
Louisiana's Congressional primary election, originally scheduled for September 6, was delayed to October 4, which then delayed the general election for two races that required a runoff vote to December 6, 2008.
Cuba.
Fidel Castro addressed in a "reflection," published on September 1 in the official daily "Granma". "Two days ago ... out of 11 international press reports devoted to Cuba, none told about the hurricane that moved toward our island and the feverish efforts of our Civil Defense," Castro writes. Instead, the news services, "echoing a Yankee press organization dedicated to the media war and campaigns against Cuba," reported about the defection of TV actor Yamil Jaled. (The "Yankee press organization" appears to be an allusion to "El Nuevo Herald", which broke the news of Jaled's arrival in Miami.) "What a patriot! What a democrat! What a brilliant example," wrote Castro. "This way, the world is informed about a character a lot less known and important than Hurricane Gustav. They want to make a sacred cow out of him."
Retirement.
Because of the damage and deaths, on April 22, 2009, the name "Gustav" was retired by the World Meteorological Organization, and won't be used again. It will be replaced with Gonzalo in 2014.

Allan Wright

Group Captain Allan Richard Wright (born 20 Feb 1920) is a British former RAF flying ace who flew during the Battle of Britain in the Second World War. Wright scored 11 kills, three shared kills, five probable kills and seven damaged against the German "Luftwaffe" and one of the last surviving airmen called "The Few".
Early life.
Wright was born in Devon on 12 February 1920. His father had been in the Royal Flying Corps from 1916 and retired from the RAF in 1943. He entered Royal Air Force College Cranwell as a Flight Cadet in April 1938.
Military career.
After training Wright was posted to No. 92 Squadron RAF at RAF Tangmere on 29 October flying Bristol Blenheim night fighters. On March 8, 1940, the squadron converted to Spitfires. Wright flew his first combat mission on May 23, 1940 over Dunkirk and claimed a probable Messerschmitt Bf 110 destroyed and two damaged. The following day Wright added one confirmed Me 110 and one 'probable' Me 110 and on June 2nd a Messerschmitt Bf 109.
During the Battle of Britain he shared a Heinkel He 111 destroyed on 14 August, a Heinkel He 111 of Kampfgeschwader 27 (KG 27) at night over Bristol on 29 August, a Heinkel He 111 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 'probable' on 11 September, a Messerschmitt Bf 109 damaged on the 14th, a Messerschmitt Bf 109 'probable' on the 15th, a Junkers Ju 88 'probable' on the 19th, a Dornier Do 17 on the 26th, a Junkers Ju 88 on the 27th, and two Messerschmitt Bf 109's on the 30th. On 30 Sept he was shot down and wounded near Brighton by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 of Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27) and hospitalised. The award of the DFC was made on 22 October 1940. On 6 December 1940 he destroyed a Messerschmitt Bf 109.
By July 1941 Wright had received a bar to the DFC. He was posted to 59 OTU (Operational Training Unit) RAF in July 1941. Service with RAF Fighter Command HQ and as an instructor followed until being posted to No. 29 Squadron RAF at RAF West Malling in March 1943, where as a night fighter he had his last confirmed kill - a Junkers Ju 88 on 3 April.
For the remainder of the war, Wright worked on training and fighter tactics. He became chief instructor at the Pilot Gunnery Instructor Wing of the Central Gunner School, and later commanded the Air Fighting Developing Unit (AFDU) at RAF Wittering. In early 1945, Wright was transferred to RAF El Bellah in Egypt where commanded the fighter wing of the Middle East Advanced Bombing and Gunnery School.
Remaining in the RAF post-war, he retired as a Group Captain on 12 February 1967.
Honours and awards.
22 October 1940- Pilot Officer Allen Richard Wright (33499) is awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) -

Response factor

Response factor, usually in chromatography and spectroscopy, is the ratio between a signal produced by an analyte, and the quantity of analyte which produces the signal. Ideally, and for easy computation, this ratio is unity (one). In real-world scenarios, this is often not the case.
Expression.
The response factor formula_1 can be expressed on a molar, volume or mass basis:
where A is the signal (e.g. peak area) and the subscript "i" indicates the sample and the subscript "st" indicates the standard. The response factor of the standard is assigned an arbitrary factor, for example 1 or 100.
Response factor of sample/Response factor of standard=RRF
Chromatography.
One of the main reasons to use response factors is to compensate for the irreproducibility of manual injections into a gas chromatograph (GC). Injection volumes for GC's can be 1 microliter (µL) or less and are difficult to reproduce. Differences in the volume of injected analyte leads to differences in the areas of the peaks in the chromatogram and any quantitative results are suspect.
To compensate for this error, a known amount of an internal standard (a second compound that does not interfere with the analysis of the primary analyte) is added to all solutions (standards and unknowns). This way if the injection volumes (and hence the peak areas) differ slightly, the ratio of the areas of the analyte and the internal standard will remain constant from one run to the next.
This comparison of runs also applies to solutions with different concentrations of the analyte. The area of the internal standard becomes the value to which all other areas are referenced. Below is the mathematical derivation and application of this method.
Consider an analysis of octane (C8H18) using nonane (C9H20) as the internal standard. The 3 chromatograms below are for 3 different samples. 
The amount of octane in each sample is different, but the amount of nonane is the same (in practice this is not a requirement). Due to scaling, the areas of the nonane peak appear to have different areas, but in reality the areas are identical. Therefore, the relative amounts of octane in each sample increases in the order of mixture 1 (least) < mixture 3 < mixture 2 (most).
This conclusion is reached because the ratio of the area of octane to that of nonane is the least in mixture 1 and the most, in mixture 2. Mixture 3 has an intermediate ratio. This ratio can be written as formula_3.
In chromatography, the area of a peak is proportional to the number of moles times some constant of proportionality, Area = k×n. The number of moles of compound is equal to the concentration (molarity, M) times the volume, n = MV. From these equations, the following derivation is made:
Since both compounds are in the same solution and are injected together, the volume terms are equal and cancel out. The above equation is then rearranged to solve for the ratio of the k's. This ratio is then called the response factor, F.
The response factor, F, is equal to the ratios of the k's, which are constant. Therefore F is constant. What this means is that regardless of the amounts of octane and nonane in solution, the ratio of the ratios of area to concentration will always yield a constant.
In practice, a solution containing known amounts of both octane and nonane is injected into a GC and a response factor, F, is calculated. Then a separate solution with an unknown amount of octane and a known amount of nonane is injected. The response factor is applied to the data from the second solution and the unknown concentration of the octane is found.
This example deals with the analysis of octane and nonane, but can be applied to any two compounds.

Treasure Island (1977 TV series)

Treasure Island is a 1977 television adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous 1883 novel. It was filmed in 1977 on location in Plymouth and Dartford, and in Corsica, and also at BBC Television Centre at Wood Lane, London. 
Jim Hawkins (Ashley Knight) discovers a treasure map and embarks on a journey to find the treasure, but pirates led by Long John Silver (Alfred Burke) have plans to take the treasure for themselves by way of mutiny. This four-episode adaptation by John Lucarotti, while particularly faithful to the original, adds an expanded narrative concerning the declining Daniel Hawkins, as well as clarifying Squire Trelawney's naiveté in trusting Blandly and Silver.
This takes place in the first episode; Billy Bones tempts Jim's father into arranging a two-man treasure voyage, the corrupt shipping agent Ezra Blandly guesses their intentions and tips off Silver, who hoodwinks and then cruelly tortures the information out of a hapless alcoholic Mr Arrow. Billy Bones plans founder, and Hawkins snr catches pneumonia in the rain, which finishes him.
Lucarotti's additions to the original provide useful backstory, and the pirate idiom is sufficiently well captured for these additions not to be too obvious.
While the director, Michael E. Briant, has clearly made sure that all the characters are much more strongly defined on screen than they are in the novel, and has cast most of the great TV character actors of the 70s, Alfred Burke is a quite astonishing Sea Cook; slick, violent, cunning, and dangerously plausible. The characterisation bears comparison with that of Robert Newton.

Robert Ullyett

Robert Bassett Ullyett (April 5, 1936 – October 19, 2004) was a Rhodesian first-class cricketer who played for Rhodesia in the Currie Cup.
The all-rounder was one of six 'South African Cricket Annual Cricketers of the Year' in 1964 on the back of a strong Currie Cup season in which he scored 449 runs at 49.88. It was the first time that he had played as a specialist batsman and he was Rhodesia's leading run-getter that season. Despite having success with the ball in previous years, he didn't add to his 46 first-class wickets from that season until his retirement, only bowling the occasional over. He had twice taken seven wickets in an innings back in 1958, with a best of 7/42 against North Eastern Transvaal at Benoni.
Ullyett represented Rhodesia in field hockey at the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo and scored a goal in their 4-1 loss to Great Britain. His son Kevin Ullyett is a professional tennis player who won Grand Slam doubles titles at the US and Australian Opens.
In 2000 Ullyett served at the Match Referee in two List A matches at a ICC Emerging Nations Tournament which Zimbabwe hosted.

Pettaquamscutt Historical Society Museum

The Pettaquamscutt Historical Society Museum is a former jail building in Kingston, Rhode Island, USA, that houses the organization, a collection of fine Early American artifacts, and a history within the building's wall. 
History of the building.
"Pettaquamscutt Historical Society Museum" was the location of the former old Rhode Island Washington County Jail. situated at the crest of the hill on Kingstown Road and Upper College Road at the University of Rhode Island southeastern entrance on Route 138. The front building was constructed in 1792 recognized by the National Register of Historical Places plaque, the rear building 1856 as the old jail, for the purpose of confining criminals who disrupted the society of old Washington County, with further redesigned 1861. One of many locals tradesmen, Amos Reynold Sweet set the rafters of the structure with local oakwood, and built walls of mica greywacke and Westerly RI granite stones, mortar and the iron cell gates. The jail was closed in 1956, and the building by 1958 housed the Pettaquamscutt Historical Society Museum. The front section of the building was redesigned in 1956 to establish the museum art collection, library and historical records, while the rear section of jail cells was refurbished and opened to the visiting public.
History of the society.
The Pettaquamscutt Historical Society was founded in 1958 by South County, RI residents to encourage the study and appreciation of the history of the region; collect and preserve materials of historic interest; and preserve and mark local historical sites. A quarterly newsletter is printed offering sponsored educational workshops and lectures, and historical site visits. Pettaquamscutt Historical Society is a member of the Historical Sites Coalition of RI (HSCRI).
Pettaquamscutt Historical Society Museum collection.
The artifact collection and library content was initiated in 1958 by donations from local residents' personal ancestral items of Early American history. 
Marjorie Webster Schunke,(1905-2002) a historian was instrumental in gathering the archived historical materials in the library and wrote volumes of printed research on local genealogy, sites and cemeteries.
On loan to Pettaquamscutt Historical Museum by his family, William Russell Sweet (1860-1946) carved in 1896 a hutch cabinet themed upon the poem "The Song of Hiawatha" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published 1855. William Russell Sweet greatly admired the American Indian and depicted their lifestyle in some of his art pieces. William Russell Sweet carved many wood pieces including wall plaques, tables and chairs each of individual themes; such as the Sweet Coat of Arms, New England sea shells as quahogs and scallops, maple leaves, nuts and berries, textile weaving patterns, and animals. His great grandson, Carson Young Sweet Ferri Carson Grant has placed on loan several other artworks to the Pettaquamscutt Historical Society Museum in RI.
The 14-by-6-foot mural depicting a white overseer and black slaves in 18th century Narragansett, RI, entitled "The Economic Activities of the Narragansett Planters", the painting's subject matter—slavery—disturbs some people, while others argue it's important to remember southern Rhode Island's plantation past. The mural was painted by Rhode Island native and renowned illustrator Ernest Hamlin Baker in the 1930s, as part of the federal government's Work Projects Administration. It hung for nearly 60 years in the Wakefield, RI post office, until the post office closed in 1999.

Hira Singh of Nabha

Sir Hira Singh (18 December 1843 – 24 December 1911) was the ruler of Nabha State, one of the Phulkian states in the Punjab.
Early life.
Hira Singh was born at Badrukhan, Jind, on 18 December 1843, the second son of Sardar Sukha Singh (died 1852), from a distant branch of the royal Sikh Phulkian dynasty of Patiala, Jind and Nabha. Little is known about his early life.
The throne of Nabha.
In 1871, the line of the Phulkian dynasty which had ruled Nabha, a small 11-gun state, since 1718 became extinct upon the death from tuberculosis of the young Raja, Bhagwan Singh (1842–1871). The remaining two lines of the dynasty-the rulers of Patiala and Jind-in conjunction with the British government fixed upon Hira Singh as the successor to the Nabha "gadi" (throne). Hira Singh ascended the throne of Nabha on 9 June 1871 and began a long and successful reign that would usher Nabha into the modern era. Great monuments and public buildings were erected, roads, railways, hospitals, schools and palaces were constructed and an efficient modern army was established that saw service during the Second Afghan War and the Tirah Expedition. As well, agriculture flourished with the construction of an irrigation canal at Sirhind, and Nabha soon produced bountiful harvests of wheat, sugar, pulses, millet and cotton, thus enabling the state to increase the value of its land revenue assessments.
As a result of Hira Singh's improvements, in 1877 Nabha was raised to a salute of 13-guns and Hira Singh himself was decorated with the Empress of India Gold Medal and knighted two years later with the GCSI.
Later years.
In 1894, Hira Singh was granted the title of Raja-i-Rajagan and in 1898 was granted a 15-gun personal salute. He was appointed a GCIE in 1903 and the following year was made a Colonel of the 14th King George's Own Ferozepore Sikhs in the British Indian Army. Only a fortnight before his death, Hira Singh was raised to the rank of Maharaja of Nabha. Hira Singh died at the Hira Mahal on Christmas Eve 1911, aged 68 after a four-decade reign. He was succeeded by his only son, Ripudaman Singh.
Family.
Hira Singh married four times and had two children, a son and a daughter

Poor Little Peppina

Poor Little Peppina is a 1916 American silent film directed by Sidney Olcott. The film was in 1916 Mary Pickford's longest film to be made. It was soon surpassed by her later films.
Plot.
Robert Torrens (Edwin Mordant) is a wealthy American, residing in Italy with his wife (Edith Shayne) and only daughter, Lois (Eileen Stewart). Franzoli Soldo (Antonio Maiori) is a mafia chief who pretends to be a butler and is in Torrens' employ. One day, he drinks too freely of his masters' wine. Fellow employee Pietro (Ernest Torti) informs Mr. Torrens, who next dischargs Soldo.
Soldo wants revenge and kills Pietro. He is caught, however, and is being put on trial for the murder. He is found guilty and sentenced to a life in jail. One month later, a mafia member helps him escape. He is determined to take revenge on the Torrens family and kidnaps Lois. When the parents find out, they call the police. Soldo is soon thought of to be the kidnapper, but he ordered some of Torrens' staff member to convince the parents Lois drowned in an accident.
Meanwhile, Soldo flees to his relatives, including his wife Bianca (Mrs. A. Maiori) - who is ordered to raise Lois as her own - and his son Beppo (Jack Pickford). Lois grows up to be Peppina (Mary Pickford), Beppo's sister. Soldo decided to meanwhile take refuge in America. Fifteen years later. The Duchess, an American heiress, takes an interest in Peppina and teaches her English.
A man named Bernando wants to marry Peppina and convinces her parents to let him take her hand. Peppina, however, has no desire to be with him and asks the Duchess what to do. She helps her escape overseas and promises her a friend of hers will provide her a home in America. Peppina runs away from home in disguise and dresses up as a boy so nobody will recognize her.
Hugh Carroll (Eugene O'Brien) is on the boat as well and meets Amy, a socialite from New York. Peppina takes refuge in his cabin, but is soon caught by him. He provides her comfort and food and offers her to stay at his cabin for the night. However, he doesn't know Peppina is actually a girl.
In New York, Soldo finds out the Torrens family will move to New York as well. He thinks he will be rewarded if he brings their daughter back to him and is determined to make some money. He sends his relatives in Italy a letter they should bring Peppina to him. Bianca responds she doesn't know where Peppina is. Meanwhile, Peppina spots Hugh together with Amy and decides to leave him. In New York, she applies for a job in Soldo's café.
After a bad experience with Soldo, Peppina becomes a messenger "boy". When she is taken under arrest, she confesses she is actually a girl. Hugh happens to be a chief at the police station and releases Peppina and orders for Soldo to be taken under arrest. After Soldo arrives at the police station, Peppina realizes he was the one who abducted her as a child. Peppina is now recognized as the Torrens' kid. Mr. and Mrs. Torrens are soon informed and reunited with their child.
Three years have passed. Peppina, now living in wealth, and Hugh are in love with each other.

Long Tieng

Long Tieng (also spelled Long Chieng, Long Cheng, or Long Chen) is a Laotian military base located in Xiangkhouang Province. During the Laotian Civil War, it served as a town and airbase operated by the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States. During this time, it was also referred to as "Lima Site 98" (LS 98) or "Lima Site 20A" (LS 20A).
At the height of its significance in the late 1960s, the "secret city" of Long Tieng maintained a population of 40,000 inhabitants, making it the second largest city in Laos at the time, although it never appeared on maps throughout this period.
History.
In 1962 the CIA first set up a headquarters for Major General Vang Pao in the Long Tieng valley, which at that time had almost no inhabitants. By 1964 a 1260m-long runway had been completed and by 1966 Long Cheng was one of the largest US installations on foreign soil, becoming one of the busiest airports in the world.
In 1971 a US Air Force F-4D Phantom mistakenly hit Long Tieng with cluster bombs, causing a fire that destroyed the CIA operations shack.
North Vietnamese forces began to threaten Long Tieng in late 1971, and came close enough to start shelling the area on December 31 at 15:30 local time. In early January, 19,000 North Vietnamese forces launched a four pronged attack on Long Tieng from all four cardinal directions, encircling the site, capturing several facilities and positions, and installing antiaircraft batteries. Despite subsequent claims of victory from communist forces, the 10,000 defenders of Long Tieng, a mixture of Hmong, Thai, and Lao, had not been overrun, and in mid-month reinforcements appeared in the form of CIA-led Thais and 1200 elite irregulars from southern Laos. After enduring a third to 50% casualties, these forces succeeded in taking back key positions by the end of the month.
Description.
Long Tieng was often described as “The Most Secret Place on Earth”. It was located in a valley at 3,100 feet elevation, high enough to have chilly nights and cold fogs. It was surrounded by mountains and on the northwest side of the runway were karst outcrops several hundred feet high. In the shadow of the Karst outcrops was “Sky” the CIA headquarters in Long Tieng. Jerry Daniels, a CIA officer codenamed “Hog,” is said to have named Sky after his home state of Montana, known as “Big Sky Country.” Long Tieng was protected on three sides by limestone mountains.
“What a place is Long Tieng,” said USAID officer Jim Schill. “Tribal soldiers dressed in military garb standing next to traditionally dressed Hmong, with Thai mercenaries milling about. And the Americans here are mostly CIA operatives with goofy code names like Hog, Mr. Clean, and Junkyard. The town itself is not much. There’s one paved road running through it and tin shacks on either side with eating shops, food stalls, and living quarters.”
During the Secret War, Long Tieng became the largest Hmong settlement in the world. In the words of one author, Long Tieng "became a desultory metropolis, an unpaved, sewerless city of 30,000 where Hmong ran noodle stands, cobbled shoes, tailored clothes, repaired radios, ran military-jeep taxi services, and interpreted for American pilots and relief workers."
Evacuation.
On February 22, 1975, the final defensive outpost for Long Tieng was defeated, leading US Brigadier General Heinie Aderholt to begin planning an evacuation. By May 1975, there were almost 50,000 guerillas and refugees living in and around the city. However, by then, the U.S. had withdrawn all its civilian and military personnel from Indochina, except for a few Embassy personnel in Laos and Jerry Daniels in Long Tieng. There were few resources for an evacuation. Daniels had only a single transport aircraft and Hmong pilot in Long Tieng to take evacuees to Udon Thani, Thailand. Aderholt located three additional American transport aircraft and pilots in Thailand. He had the planes “sheep dipped” to remove all markings identifying them as American-owned and sent them to Long Tieng. On May 10, 1975, Vang Pao reluctantly followed the CIA's counsel and decided that he could no longer maintain Long Tieng against the opposing forces. Between May 10 to May 14, 1975, US C-130s and C-46s airlifted people from the airbase to US bases in Thailand. Between 1,000 and 3,000 Hmong were evacuated. Crowds of civilians surrounded the flights on the runways, creating a chaotic atmosphere. Those evacuated were primarily Hmong military leaders and CIA employees.
The evacuation ended with the departure of Major General Vang Pao and Jerry Daniels. Vang Pao told the people still on the tarmac "Farewell, my brothers, I can do nothing more for you, I would only be a torment for you," as he boarded a helicopter. Tens of thousands of fighters and refugees were left behind. The 10,000 or more Hmong clustered around the airfield expected more aircraft to return, but they soon realized that none would come. The shelling of Long Tieng began on the afternoon of May 14. Many of the Hmong fighters and their families made their way overland to Thailand during the next several years, a dangerous journey that cost many of them their lives.
The American pilots, all civilians, participating in the evacuation were Les Strouse, Allen Rich, Matt Hoff, Jack Knotts, and Dave Kouba.
After 1975.
Long Tieng was incorporated into the restricted Xaisomboun Special Zone in 1994. This zone was dissolved on 13 January 2006, and it is now part of Xiangkhouang Province. The base is still maintained by the Laotian military.
The area's history was documented in the 2008 film "The Most Secret Place on Earth".
Namesake.
A charter school in Saint Paul, Minnesota, home to many Hmong immigrants, was named Long Tieng Academy.

Pavani (raga)

Pavani (pronounced pāvani, meaning "the purifier") is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 41st "melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Kumbhini in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 5th rāgam in the 7th "chakra Rishi". The mnemonic name is "Rishi-Ma". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra ga mi pa dhi nu". Its "" structure is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
The notes used in this scale are "shuddha rishabham, shuddha gandharam, prati madhyamam, chathusruthi dhaivatham" and "kakali nishadham". It is a "sampurna" rāgam - a rāgam that has all seven "swaras" (notes). It is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of "Manavati", which is the 5th "melakarta" scale.
"Janya" rāgams.
"Chandrajyoti" is a "janya" rāgam (derived scale) that is associated with it, in which Thyagaraja has composed couple of songs. See List of "janya" rāgams for a full list of "Pavani's janyas".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Pavani's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam" does not yield any other "melakarta". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam.
This is obvious for the 6 "Rishi chakra" rāgams ("Salagam, Jalarnavam, Jhalavarali, Navaneetam" and "Raghupriya" being the other 5), as they have 3 missing notes between G1 and M2. Since no other "swara" pair in rules of "melakarta" rāgams have a 3 note gap, "Graha bhedam" yields only invalid scales within those rules.
Cinema Song.
Ilayaraja has composed Partha Vizhi partha padi sung by K.J. Yesudas in the film Guna on this raga!

William Henry Tibbs

William Henry Tibbs (June 10, 1816 – October 18, 1906) was a Tennessee attorney and politician who served in the Confederate States Congress during the American Civil War. He was noted as a firebrand States' Rights advocate and Southern secessionist.
Biography.
Tibbs was born in Appomattox, Virginia. In 1838, he married Mary McSherry in Bledsoe County, Tennessee. The couple had two children. However, she died four years later in Mississippi. Tibbs then married Cilena Augusta Hardwick on February 2, 1843 in Cleveland, Tennessee. They were to have four more children of their own. Lucretia Clay in September 1844, John in February 1847, Mary Belle in 1849 and William in 1853 Tibbs owned and operated a prosperous hotel in Dalton, Georgia called The National located at the corner of Crawford and Hamilton Streets. The hotel was torn down to make way for the Hotel Dalton which was built in 1890. At the height of the Civil War he also owned and lived in the famous Chief Vann House in Spring Place where he lived for nine years. He was a director of the Knoxville and Dalton Telegraph Company.
Tibbs unsuccessfully ran for the 8th Senatorial District's seat in the Tennessee State Senate in 1857. He filed a formal claim for the seat, but his appeal was denied.
Following the state's ordinance of secession and the outbreak of the Civil War, he was a delegate from his East Tennessee district in the First Confederate Congress from 1862–64. A late 19th century historian compared him to two of his two colleagues in the House from East Tennessee, William G. Swan and Joseph B. Heiskell, claiming, "The third of these representatives, William H. Tibbs, was perhaps more extreme than either of the others, but of far less capacity."
After the war, Tibbs was a director of the Dalton and Morgantown Railroad in northern Georgia.
Colonel Tibbs is buried in West Hill Cemetery in Dalton, Georgia. The Tibbs Bridge, spanning the Conasauga river in Murray County, Georgia, was named after him.The first Tibbs Bridge probably was built in the 1880s. It was replaced by a steel bridge between 1913 and 1918. The steel bridge was replaced by a concrete structure around 1980.

Buena Suerte, Palawan

Buena Suerte (officially the Barangay Buena Suerte), or more known as Zone II, is one of the eighteen barangays comprising the Municipality of El Nido in the province of Palawan in the Philippines. Its name literally means "Good Luck" in Spanish. 
During the Spanish era, Cabigsing, the westernmost purok of the barangay, was the center of the town. It was then known as the "Inventario".
Geography.
Buena Suerte, one of the four Población barangays, sits on the western section of the town proper, occupying the areas from the famous limestone and marble cliffs called "taraw" that act as a backdrop and run from the southern to its westernmost sections, the Lapus-Lapus Trail that leads to the beaches of Ipil Point and Siete Commando opposite the surrounding mountain walls, and to the St. Francis of Assissi Parish Church that serves as the main office of the Parish of El Nido. It is bordered by Masagana on the east and Maligaya on the southeast. A creek, draining from Maligaya, transverses in the south and to the sea in the northwest. Off the coast of Buena Suerte lies Cadlao Island, the largest among the 45 islands in the Bacuit Bay. Its highest peak towers up to 640 meters above sea level, and is considered as El Nido's tallest mountain. The island has several pockets of white sand beaches, hidden lagoons and nature trails that lead to lush tropical rainforest. One of these nature trails leads to the charming saltwater Makaamo Lagoon, which is surrounded by mangroves that attract a proliferation of birds. Sabang Beach, one of its many beaches, was one of the settings for the Scandinavian show Robinson Expedisjonen, the predecessor to Survivor.
Government.
Buena Suerte is composed of four puroks or sitios namely, Aplaya, the beachfront area; Putting Bato ("White Rock"), the cliffside area; Cabigsing, the port area, and Cadlao, the largest island off the coast of the municipality. 
Like all other barangays in the country, it is governed from the Barangay Hall by a "Barangay Captain", an elected official entitled for three-year term, who is aided by the "Sangguniang Barangay member"s ("barangay kagawads" or counselors), also elected. In 2005, it has a budgetary allocation of PHP 681,365 from the Philippine government.
Demographics.
Population.
Buena Suerte, one of the most densely populated area in the entire municipality, ranks only third to Bucana and Teneguiban in terms of the total number of constituents. As of August 1, 2007, it has a population of 2,209. The barangay has a heavy presence of migrants from other parts of the Philippines, and it is also home to a number of foreigners who intermarried with the local inhabitants.
Livelihood.
Being a coastal area, the main livelihood is fishing and tourism. Seafood is a local speciality, in fact, many fishes are exported to Manila, and to other Southeast Asian countries. Commercial and tourist establishments also abound the area. Bay View Inn (also known as El Nido Sands Inn), the oldest tourist inn, can be found here.
Religion.
Buena Suerte is predominantly Catholic as the rest of El Nido, although there are sizable number of people who constitute other Christian denominations, such as Baptist, Iglesia Ni Kristo, among others.
Transportation.
Seaport.
Located in Cabigsing, El Nido Port Zone, serves a number of cargo and passenger ships from Coron and Manila. Since March 7, 2005, the port zone has been managed and supervised by the Philippine Ports Authority. Pump boats and speedboats also dock at the side of the port. 
In 2009, plans of establishing a 51,440 square meter-Roll On Roll Off (Roro) port in Buena Suerte was stalled after facing strong opposition from the Department of Tourism and local communities. Citing that the project would not only damage the ecosystem, critics of the port project also found out that it would go against the municipality's Comprehensive Land and Water Use Plan, which stated that the area is limited to "low density and nature-based" tourism activities.
Road systems and bridges.
Most roads and streets in Buena Suerte are made of concrete materials and rolled gravel. The main roads are Calle Real near Putting Bato (White Rock) and Sirena Street in Aplaya. Tricycles and motorcycles are the most popular types of transportation to go around the barangay because some of the streets here are too narrow for jeepneys and private vehicles to pass by. In addition, makeshift and wooden bridges are common in estuarine parts of Putting Bato and Cabigsing that are lying on a nearby creek or situated in what used to be mangrove forests.

Lioré et Olivier LeO 21

__NOTOC__
The Lioré et Olivier LéO 21 was a 1920s French biplane airliner and later military transport based on the earlier LéO 20 night bomber.
Development.
First flown in August 1929 the LéO 21 was a twin-engined biplane airliner with a fixed tailskid landing gear. It retained the basic structure of the LéO 20 night bomber but with a new wider fuselage. It had room for six passengers in a nose cabin and a further 12 passengers in the main cabin with an open cockpit for the pilot.
The second LéO 21 was fitted with two 450 hp (336 kW) Renault 12Ja engines and re-designated as a LéO 212. It was converted by the Wagons-Lits company as a "dining aircraft". The first LéO 21 became an avion-bar in 1929 and was re-designated LéO 211; it was later modified in 1931 with Renault engines as the LéO 213. One aircraft was produced as the LéO 21S fitted as a 10-stretcher ambulance. The first production LéO 213 was built in 1928 and a total of eleven were built and operated on routes from Paris to London, Lyons, Marseilles and Geneva. The LéO 213 had an increased wingspan, improved sound proofing and three baggage holds. When modified for night services they were re-designated as LéO 213N. In 1934 all the surviving LéO 213s were bought by the "Armée de l'Air" (French Air Force) and were converted to transports for 14-troops on bench seats and re-designated LéO 214.

The Holocaust Experience

The Holocaust Experience is a 2003 documentary by Oeke Hoogendijk that takes a serious, slightly critical, look at Holocaust museums around the globe. The film asks where the line between remembering the genocide and exploiting the dead lies and if it's already been crossed.
Summary.
Putting Holocaust victims’ hair on display became a controversial exhibit for the United States Holocaust Museum, when survivors protested that the display would be an exploitation of those who had died. "The Holocaust Experience" looks at this and other moral questions surrounding what has become an industry of remembrance.
Sixty years after the Holocaust, survivors are dying and concentration camp infrastructure is beginning to decay. Deliberate efforts must be made in order to preserve the past. Few would argue the importance of remembering; but is there something wrong with learning about the Holocaust through blockbuster films, or with hopping off a tour bus, in fanny pack and sunscreen, into a concentration camp?
The Holocaust Experience moves between the noisy, hyper-realistic Holocaust museums in America and the decaying ruins of Auschwitz to quietly critique the role of both as proper memorials. At the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C., animated tour guides give rehearsed speeches that try to both shock and entertain their groups, while in Poland, tourists arrive at Auschwitz on buses with “Cracow Tours” painted on the side, and pose for pictures at the entrance gate, below the notorious sign reading “Arbeit Macht Frei” (work makes you free).
Auschwitz was once the largest of the Nazi concentration camps, where 1.1 million people were murdered. But sixty years have passed since the world learned of the genocide that took place there, and now the documentary’s camera captures icy, poetic shots of beautiful young girls jogging around the camp, little boys playing soccer nearby, and a woman hanging up her laundry to dry right next to its fence. Earth that was stained with the blood of over a million people is now casually trod on everyday.
The truth is, survivors agree, if you did not live through the Holocaust, you will never know their fear, and never fully understand the horrors. “I try to paint a picture that will stir them up, get them thinking,” a survivor who serves as a tour guide says, “but I never expect the audience to understand what it was like.”

MultiCare Mary Bridge Children's Hospital &amp; Health Center

Mary Bridge Children's Hospital and Health Center is a pediatric hospital located in Tacoma, Washington. It is a 72-bed facility and a state-designated level II pediatric trauma center. Mary Bridge was established in 1955 by members of Tacoma Orthopedic Association, a women's volunteer group established in 1921. Members of the Tacoma Orthopedic Association saw a need for a specialized pediatric health care center in Tacoma. Key funding came from the estate of Dr. Albert W. Bridge, a physician who practiced in Eatonville, Washington and later also opened a clinic in Tacoma. The hospital was named for his mother, Mary. 
Mary Bridge is physically connected with Tacoma General Hospital and both hospitals are owned and operated by MultiCare Health System, a Tacoma-based not-for-profit integrated health organization. Consequently, Mary Bridge and Tacoma General cooperate extensively and share resources with each other. Mary Bridge is affiliated with the University of Washington and is an active teaching site for medical students. It also has a joint pediatric heart surgery program with Seattle Children's hospital.
Facilities.
Mary Bridge has 72 licensed beds. It has a 13-bed pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and a separate 65-bed neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) housed in Tacoma General Hospital, the adjoining adult facility. In 2004, a $67 million surgery center was added to the Mary Bridge campus. In 2005, the outpatient center moved into a new facilities.
Volume of health care services.
In 2007, Mary Bridge Children's Hospital had 3,990 medical and surgical inpatient admissions, 359 pediatric intensive care unit admissions, performed 5,392 surgeries, received 30,147 emergency department visits, and 41,055 outpatient clinic visits.

<doc id="19027847" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19027847" title="Paha (landform)">
Paha (landform)

A Paha is a hill or ridge, typically formed of sand and capped with loess. The word "paha" means hill in Dakota Sioux. The most well known Paha is the paha around which the town of Mount Vernon, Iowa developed.
Origin.
An early theory of the origin of the paha hills of Iowa described them as being "composed in part of water-laid sand and silt and in part of ice-moulded till."
Later, after it came to be understood that loess was wind deposited silt, pahas came to be interpreted as a kind of sand dune. "Their persistent southeasterly trend suggests deposition of the loess by prevailing northwesterly winds, possibly anticyclonic winds blowing from the retreating ice sheet."
Explaining Pahas as a kind of dune does not explain why they are not shaped like other dune forms. The modern explanation is that the shape of Pahas was the result of the permafrost conditions that dominated glacial till plains of the Iowan surface during the last ice age. Permafrost effects controlled both the way this surface eroded and the way loess accumulated on this surface.
The origin of paha can be explained using a relatively new concept involving snowmelt erosion (Iannicelli, 2000; Iannicelli, 2003; Iannicelli 2010). There are two categories of unlithified paha: Illinois-type paha and Iowan paha. The geomorphic shapes of both categories are basically the same, that being all paha are either oval, oblong or elongated. However, the regional geomorphology of both categories of paha differ greatly: the Illinois-type paha occur in great numbers while the paha-ridges are contiguous and bunched together; the Iowan paha occur in less numbers and are usually at a distance from one another. The region of the Iowan Erosion Surface (upon which the paha lay) and contiguous regions northeast of it (Paleozoic Plateau & the Driftless Area) laid in relative proximity to the edge of the nearby ancient continental ice sheet. During the cold phases of the Pleistocene, a harsh & peculiar snowy world existed in all three of these regions. This is because an anticyclonic wind system hovered over the ice sheets while it blew snow-bearing winds from off the glacial ice sheet towards the southwest. This caused extra accumulated snow amounts within the previously-mentioned regions. All of the paha are oriented NW-SE which would be transverse to the snow-bearing winds that blew to the southwest. If we apply the concept of transverse snow dunes and their erosive snowmelt carving out parallel linear depressions and sub-parallel (slightly anastomising) depressions, we can manifest the early stages of initial paha formation (Iannicelli, 2003). This early form of the paha topography is seen in the extreme northwestern part of Illinois because of the existence of relict Illinois-type loess paha (Iannicelli, 2003). These type paha are oblong ridges that are separated from one another by linear depressions. Illinois-type paha cannot be loess dunes because true loess is deposited from dust settling out from atmospheric suspension and then onto the ground which contrasts from that of dunes because dunes only originate from saltation transport. Thus, newly formed loess deposits originally expresses itself as a blanket of fine-grain material. The general position of Illinois-type paha in northwestern Illinois, lays south of the Driftless Area of Illinois. Wind strength generated from the anticyclonic system was minimal here, so that it drifted the snow into the shape of transverse snow dunes. Erosion here was only vertical and it only carved down into the loess and not into the till that lay beneath the loess. As any observer looks towards the northwest into Iowa, the topography changes so that an extensive flat tract of till surrounds loess-capped till paha, causing the paha to be isolated from one another. This planed expanse of land that surrounds the paha is known as the Iowan Erosion Surface (I.E.S.). Other investigators have identified the I.E.S. as being formed and flattened by running water (Ruhe et al., 1968) or sheetwash (Hallberg et al., 1978). Hallberg et al. (1978) identified the flat I.E.S. as "non-classical" pediments. However, when we apply the concept of snow-bearing winds dumping an extraordinary amount of snow onto the I.E.S., a better-modified interpretation of the I.E.S. is that it was leveled by cryopedimentation through widespread, blanket-like snowmelt erosion which would account for its planar form (Iannicelli, 2010). Hence, Iowan paha embryonically started off in similarity to Illinois-type paha but then cryopedimentation isolated them (essentially unlithified inselbergs) to give them their own distinctive geomorphic flavor. The nearby regions of the Paleozoic Plateau & the Driftless Area as a unit, have their own version of paha-forms, that being these are lithified paha which are now known as "rock paha" (oriented, oblong ridges of rock) (Iannicelli, 2010). They too also lay on extensive flat surfaces and the same concept that was applied to the I.E.S. is applied to them because they have correlating planed surfaces known as the Lancaster & Dodgeville Erosion Surfaces (Iannicelli, 2010). The upland planed surface of the Driftless Area & Paleozoic Plateau regions is specifically explained as being created by cryoplanation that was sourced from snowmelt (Iannicelli, 2010) that originated from snow blown off the continental ice sheet. Thus, the isolated Iowan till paha are equated as unlithified paleopermafrost inselbergs while the rock paha would be equated simply as inselbergs in the non-classical sense (Iannicelli, 2010).
Distribution.
There is a well-defined band of pahas between Mount Vernon, Iowa and Martelle, crossed by Iowa Highway 1. The large majority of pahas are in Benton, Linn, Johnson and Jones counties in Iowa. These are on the Iowan surface in north-east Iowa. 
Casey's Paha State Preserve in Hickory Hills County Park, Tama County, Iowa preserves the south-east end of a long paha.
Paha ridges have also been identified on the Kansan surface, generally not far from Iowa, and in western Illinois and eastern Europe.
Similar ridge forms occur in the arid upwind parts of the Palouse region of Washington. Outside of the Midwest, several of the above-cited authors use the term "greda" to refer to features that are indistinguishable from Paha ridges.

Gil Green (1906–1997) was a leading figure in the Communist Party of the United States of America until 1991. He is best remembered as the leader of the party's youth section, the Young Communist League, during the tumultuous decade of the 1930s.
Biography.
Early years.
Gil Green was born Gilbert Greenberg in Chicago in 1906. His parents were working class Jewish immigrants from the Russian empire.
Political career.
Green joined the Young Communist League in 1924 and rose through its ranks, becoming its national secretary in 1931. In 1935 Green was named one of three communist youth leaders named to the Executive Committee of the Communist International in Moscow.
Later in 1935, the 6th World Congress of the Young Communist International (YCI) elected Green to the Executive Committee and Secretariat of that body.
Green remained a prominent youth leader of the American Communist Party throughout the depression decade, attending the 1936 World Youth Congress held in Geneva and serving as one of three YCI delegates to a meeting with the rival Socialist Youth International that drew up a unity agreement with regards to aiding the Spanish Republic in the ongoing Spanish Civil War. Green was also a delegate to the 1938 World Youth Congress held in the United States at Vassar College.
Leaving the communist youth movement at the end of the decade, Green was selected as a member of the National Board of the Communist Party, USA. He served as the party's top official, district organizer, of the key party district of New York from 1941 to 1945. Following the fall of his patron Earl Browder in 1945, Green was moved out of New York to become district organizer in Chicago. He was returned to New York City and a place on the party's National Board in 1947.
Green's status as a top official of the Communist Party made him a target for prosecution during the McCarthy era. Along with 11 other top party officials, Green was indicted in July 1948 under the Smith Act and convicted and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment following a lengthy 1949 trial. Unlike his co-defendants Green became a fugitive from justice following the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the verdict in 1951, remaining in the underground until voluntarily surrendering to authorities on February 27, 1956, Thereafter, Green was incarcerated in federal prison until July 29, 1961.
In the 1960s Green again returned prominence as the Communist Party's Chairman in New York, but he fell afoul of party leader Gus Hall in 1968 when he joined a section of party members who vocally criticized the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia. Thereafter, Green quit the National Committee, although he remained a member of the Communist Party for another two decades.
In 1991, following the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union, Green left the party and helped found the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism.
Death and legacy.
Green died on May 4, 1997 at a nursing home in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He was 90 years old at the time of his death.
Green's papers reside at the Tamiment Library of New York University in New York City.

HIV/AIDS in Namibia

HIV/AIDS in Namibia is a critical public health issue. The prevalence of HIV in Namibia is among the highest in the world. Since 1996, HIV has been the leading cause of death in the country. Close to 17 per cent of the country’s children under the age of 18 are orphaned by at least one parent – mostly due to HIV. Consequently, life expectancy has declined since independence from 61 years (in 1991) to 49 years in 2001.
In Namibia, HIV is mainly spread through heterosexual sex, driven by high rates of multiple and concurrent partnerships, transactional sex and child abuse, misconceptions in the general population about the risk of contracting HIV, low and inconsistent condom use, low rates of male circumcision, high rates of alcohol abuse, a high rate of mobility and migration, and a decline in marital and cohabiting unions. Of greatest concern to many are the AIDS orphans and vulnerable children left behind in the trails of this disease.
Government Programmes.
Surveys.
To determine prevalence, the Namibian government conducts a bi-annual serological survey among pregnant women, ages 15–49. The survey is done anonymously during routine antenatal care visits, which means that the results cannot be linked to anyone.
In 2008, Namibia had an HIV prevalence rate of 17.8% in adults ages 15 to 49, which is lower than 19.9% in 2006. However, the figure is still quite distressing. The peak occurred in 2002 when Namibia’s prevalence hit 22%. The most recent survey (2008) further indicates that HIV prevalence is highest at 27% in the 30-34 year-old age group and is at its lowest (5.1%) among women aged 15–19 years. In response to this information, the Namibian Ministry of Health and Social Services recommended that prevention measures be intensified, that HIV/AIDS components be main-streamed into all development projects, that more Namibians be encourage to use voluntary counselling and testing services, and that antiretroviral treatment be expanded to all parts of the country, especially the rural areas.
Data compiled by the Ministry of Health and Social Services show that AIDS became the leading cause of death in Namibia in 1996. It is estimated that AIDS accounts for at least half of all deaths among individuals ages 15 to 49. However, there is great variation in HIV prevalence rates from region to region in Namibia. Infection rates also differ by gender, with UNAIDS estimating that women account for 58 percent of all HIV infections.
Treatment.
Namibia is the second most sparsely populated country in the world. Providing comprehensive HIV/AIDS services to the mostly rural population requires a fully decentralized, community-based approach with strong policies and leadership from the central level. Insufficient numbers of skilled technical personnel and limited managerial capacity at all levels have exacerbated the challenges of decentralization, and access to services remains limited for those living in sparsely populated areas. As the country with one of the highest levels of income disparity in the world, poverty and household nutrition pose major challenges. Yet, by the end of 2007, some 52,000 people in Namibia were receiving anti-retroviral therapy to combat HIV. At the same time, mother-to-child transmission has also fallen dramatically – starting from just two hospitals in 2002. This is one of Namibia’s greatest success stories of modern times.
Orphan Care and Support.
Namibia's Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare works closely with various development partners, non-governmental organizations and faith-based groups to implement the National Plan of Action for Orphans and Vulnerable Children. 
There are many organizations working in Namibia to provide services to orphans and vulnerable children. Two of the larger organizations are: Catholic AIDS Action (http://www.caa.org.na) and the Church Alliance for Orphans (CAFO)(http://www.cafo-namibia.org).
Although data on contribution of various development partners is inadequate, the US government's contribution is especially significant. Its PEPFAR program has allocated approximately $158 million for care and support to orphans and vulnerable children in Namibia since 2004. In 2007, 78,700 children received at least some assistance, although the total number of orphans is estimated to be about 250,000. (This number does include vulnerable children who are not orphans, which renders the total number of needy children much higher.)

The Eternal Grind

The Eternal Grind is a 1916 silent drama film directed by John B. O'Brien, and starring Mary Pickford. The film is inspired by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which took place in 1911. 
Plot.
Louise (Pickford) is a sewing-machine girl in a sweatshop in New York City. She lives together with her sisters Amy (Loretta Blake) and Jane (Dorothy West) and are all deprived by bad conditions at work and sickness. Louise tries for the three of them to survive and regards herself as the keeper of her sisters.
Meanwhile, she stands up to her bosses and complains about the dreadful circumstances they work in. When Amy is seduced by the son of the shop-owner, Louise butts in and stops the romance. He eventually abandons Amy and becomes seriously injured in a cave-in. Louise has a secret crush on the son herself and tries to rescue him, hoping he will admit he loves her.
Reception.
The film was received generally negatively, with "The New York Times" saying, "Obliged by her Famous Players contract to star in pedestrian melodramas like The Eternal Grind, it was no wonder that Mary Pickford yearned to become her own producer".

HIV/AIDS in Nigeria

As of 2012 in Nigeria, the HIV prevalence rate among adults ages 15–49 was 3.1 percent. Nigeria has the second-largest number of people living with HIV. The HIV epidemic in Nigeria is complex and varies widely by region. In some states, the epidemic is more concentrated and driven by high-risk behaviors, while other states have more generalized epidemics that are sustained primarily by multiple sexual partnerships in the general population. Youth and young adults in Nigeria are particularly vulnerable to HIV, with young women at higher risk than young men. There are many risk factors that contribute to the spread of HIV, including prostitution, high-risk practices among itinerant workers, high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI), clandestine high-risk heterosexual and homosexual practices, international trafficking of women, and irregular blood screening.
Nigeria is emerging from a period of military rule that accounted for almost 28 of the 47 years since independence in 1960. Consequently, the policy environment is not fully democratized. Civil society was weak during the military era, and its role in advocacy and lobbying remains weak. The size of the population and the nation pose logistical and political challenges particularly due to the political determination of the Nigerian Government to achieve health care equity across geopolitical zones. The necessity to coordinate programs simultaneously at the federal, state and local levels introduces complexity into planning. The large private sector is largely unregulated and, more importantly, has no formal connection to the public health system where most HIV interventions are delivered. Training and human resource development is severely limited in all sectors and will hamper program implementation at all levels. Care and support is limited because existing staff are overstretched and most have insufficient training in key technical areas to provide complete HIV services.

Ammannia robusta

Ammannia robusta is a species of flowering plant in the loosestrife family known by the common name grand redstem. It is native to most of western and central North America, where it grows in moist places, such as ditches and pond margins. It is an annual herb reaching about a metre in maximum height when growing erect. The leaves are up to 8 cm long and linear to lance-shaped. The leaves and stem are green to red in color. The inflorescences are clusters of up to five flowers in the leaf axils. The flowers are urn-shaped with light lavender petals about half a centimetre long and protruding stamens with yellow anthers. The fruit is a spherical capsule about half a centimetre wide containing several tiny seeds.

HIV/AIDS in Rwanda

Rwanda faces a generalized epidemic, with an HIV prevalence rate of 3.1 percent among adults ages 15 to 49. The prevalence rate has remained relatively stable, with an overall decline since the late 1990s, partly due to improved HIV surveillance methodology. In general, HIV prevalence is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, and women are at higher risk of HIV infection than men. Young women ages 15 to 24 are twice as likely to be infected with HIV as young men in the same age group. Populations at higher risk of HIV infection include people in prostitution and men attending clinics for sexually transmitted infections.
Rwanda is among the world’s least developed countries, ranking 166 of 187 in the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Human Development Index. Some 60 percent of the population lives in poverty. During the three months of genocide in 1994, mass rape, sexual torture and psychological trauma were common. Massive population flows following the genocide have resulted in an increase in the urban population. The shortage of human resources throughout the health sector is a significant constraint. Of Rwandans killed or displaced during the genocide, a disproportionate number were highly skilled and educated members of society, including doctors, nurses and other health workers. Many health centers lack essential physical facilities, equipment and supplies. Electricity supply is erratic throughout Rwanda, impacting hospitals, health centers and laboratories. Blood safety, data management and drug storage are all impacted by the erratic electricity supply. While stigma continues to be a problem for people living with HIV/AIDS, it would appear that the situation is slowly improving due to good information sharing at all levels about HIV/AIDS.

HIV/AIDS in Zambia

Zambia is experiencing a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic, with a national HIV prevalence rate of 17 percent among adults ages 15 to 49. The primary modes of HIV transmission are through heterosexual sex and mother-to-child transmission. HIV prevalence rates vary considerably within the country. Infection rates are highest in cities and towns along major transportation routes and lower in rural areas with low population density. HIV prevalence among pregnant women can range from less than 10 percent in some areas to 30 percent in others. In general, however, young women ages 25 to 34 are at much higher risk of being infected by HIV than young men in the same age group. The prevalence rates are 12.7 and 3.8 percent, respectively. Other at-risk populations include military personnel, people in prostitution, truck drivers, and people who work in fisheries. Although men who have sex with men have a higher risk of HIV transmission than those who do not, the government-operated National AIDS Control Program does not address same-sex relationships. While Zambia’s national prevalence rate remains high and shows no sign of declining, the country has been noted for its significant increases in antiretroviral treatment (ART) access.
With about one million Zambians living with HIV/AIDS and 200,000 of these persons requiring ART, the Government of the Republic of Zambia has prioritized making ART available to all Zambians in need. A recent rapid assessment of the Zambian ART program identified several important constraints including: inadequate human resources for counseling, testing, and treatment-related care; gaps in supply of drugs in the public sector; increase in value of the Zambian Kwacha; lack of adequate logistic/supply chain systems; stigma that hinders people from seeking treatment and care; lack of information on the availability of treatment services; a high level of misinformation about ART; need for a continuous funding stream as an accumulation of patients on ART results in a growing need for support; high cost of ART to patients, despite subsidies from the public sector; lack of referral between counseling and testing services and ART; and lack of referral between home-based care services, testing and ART.

Frederic Ewen

Frederic Ewen (1899 – October 18, 1988) was an English professor at Brooklyn College from 1930 to 1952. During the height of the McCarthy period Ewen was forced to resign his teaching position after refusing to cooperate with a Senate Internal Security Committee investigation of communism and higher education.
Early years.
Frederic Ewen, who was born in Lemberg, Austria in 1899, one of eleven children. He immigrated to the United States with his family in 1912. He graduated from the City College of New York and received his Ph.D. in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University. His first book, "The Prestige of Schiller in England", based on his doctoral dissertation, was published by Columbia University Press.
Academic career.
Ewen was appointed assistant professor of English at Brooklyn College in 1930. he joined the Teachers Union shortly thereafter and was involved in left politics on campus and within the larger movement in New York City.
In 1940 the New York State Legislature's Joint Committee to Investigate Procedures and Methods of Allocating State Moneys for Public Purposes and Subversive Activities, known as the Rapp-Coudert Committee, launched an investigation of public schools and city colleges. Along with 6 other professors, Ewen was summoned before the committee and refused to testify. He described the committee's work as "an attack on the things that the system stands for and has fought in the last 20 years to obtain." The Committee sought to jail some of them, including Ewen, for contempt. In his defense he submitted an affidavit stating "I am not a Communist or a member of the Communist party and I have never engaged in any 'subversive' activities at Brooklyn College or elsewhere." Ewen and his Brooklyn College colleagues were tenured, so they retained their position, while City College professors including Morris Schappes and Moses Finley lost their jobs when their contracts were not renewed. 
In 1942, the English department recommended Ewen for promotion to associate professor. College president Harry Gideonse declined to approve it. In 1952, Ewen and three of the other Brooklyn College professors who had been called to testify by the Rapp-Coudert Committee were summoned before the U.S. Senate Internal Security Committee chaired by Pat McCarran. They again refused to testify. Having served 30 years, Ewen was eligible for retirement and announced his decision to retire when he took the witness chair". He later told reporters he did so "for reasons of intellectual honesty". The other three professors lost their jobs.
After being forced to leave Brooklyn College, Ewen assembled a team of blacklisted actors, including Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, and John Randolph to present dramatic readings of great works of literature. The group performed at union halls, theaters, and other venues. 
When the repression of the McCarthy era began to lift in the early 1960s, Ewen, along with Phoebe Brand and John Randolph, produced an adaptation of James Joyce's "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man", which had a two-year run (1962–63) at the Martinique Theatre in New York City. In 1967 Ewen published "Bertolt Brecht: His Life, His Art, and His Times". Howard Clurman, reviewing it in the "New York Times", said "it conveys the excitement, the turmoil and triumph of Brecht's career." During these years he worked with Brand and Randolph on adaptations of a series of Anton Chekhov's plays for CBS's Camera Three series.
The 1972, he signed a letter protesting the treatment of Leopold Trepper by the Polish government, along with John Hersey and others.
Later years.
Ewen remained active until well into his 80s. In 1984 he published "The Heroic Imagination: The Creative Genius of Europe from Waterloo (1815) to the Revolution of 1848", in which he took issue with the new literary criticism that focused on a close reading of the text without considering social context as literary critics had when Ewen was coming of age in the academy of the 1930s and 1940s. At the time of his death, Ewen was working on a second volume, which appeared posthumously as "A Half-Century of Greatness: The Creative Imagination of Europe 1848–1884". These two volumes explore the relationship between Marxism and Romanticism, the politics of protest and revolution, and the European literary tradition.
Shortly before his death, Brooklyn College formally apologized to him and to the other professors dismissed during the McCarthy era. The college later established a lecture series on civil rights in his name.
Ewen died in New York City of a heart attack on October 18, 1988. That same month Citadel Press published his introduction to a collection of the stories of Maxim Gorky.
He was married to composer Miriam Gideon (1906-1996).

HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe

Recent estimates from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) indicate that approximately 1.6 million adults 15 years and older were living with HIV/AIDS in 2005. Despite the severity of the epidemic, prevalence rates in Zimbabwe have begun to show signs of decline, from 22.1 percent prevalence among adults ages 15 to 19 in 2003 to 20.1 percent prevalence in the same age group in 2005. Dr. Peter Piot, head of UNAIDS, said that in Zimbabwe, “The declines in HIV rates have been due to changes in behaviour, including increased use of condoms, people delaying the first time they have sexual intercourse, and people having fewer sexual partners.”
Zimbabwe has a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic with HIV transmitted primarily through heterosexual contact and mother-to-child transmission. High risk groups, including migrant laborers, people in prostitution, girls involved in intergenerational sexual relationships, discordant couples, and members of the uniformed services warrant special attention in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Young adults and women are hardest hit by the epidemic. In 2005, approximately 930,000 women over the age of 14 were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe continues to suffer a severe socioeconomic and political crisis, including unprecedented rates of inflation and a severe ‘brain drain’ of Zimbabwe’s health care professionals. Elements of a previously well-maintained health care infrastructure are crumbling. Zimbabwe’s HIV crisis is exacerbated by chronic food insecurity. Sub-optimal nutrition increases the vulnerability of individuals with compromised immune systems to life-threatening opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis. Gender inequality and widespread practices of multiple and concurrent sexual relationships, and cross-generational sex fuel Zimbabwe’s epidemic, particularly among youth. Social norms, including stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, excessive alcohol consumption, and a reluctance to talk about HIV status or sexual relations also create barriers to behavior change.

International Value Wine Awards

The International Value Wine Awards or IVWA are held annually each summer in Calgary, Alberta. The competition has the specific goal of determining the finest value wines in the world available to Canadians. The awards are organized and operated by Wine Access magazine; results of the competition are released on 1 October to the competition’s website, and published in Wine Access magazine's October/November issue.
History.
In June 2006 Wine Access held the first ever International Value Wine Awards. The awards focused only on wines that retail for less than CDN $25 a price category that accounts for 97% of wine purchases by volume in Canada. In its first year, the IVWA judged nearly 1,000 wines from 17 countries.
Awards were organized by varietal or style and by country of origin. The highest rated red wine was Château Sainte-Eulalie 2003 La Cantilène, from the Minervois appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) in Languedoc, France. La Cantilène is a blend of 55% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 15% Carignan. It was awarded a score of 91 points. The highest rated white was Goundrey 2005 Homestead Unwooded Chardonnay from Western Australia; it scored 90 points.
In 2007 the awards returned to Calgary and again saw just under 1000 wines entered from 271 different wineries in 14 different countries. Unlike the previous year, overall best red and best white awards were not handed out. The highest scoring red in 2007 was Nugan Estate 2005 McLaren Parish Shiraz from McLaren Vale, South Australia; and the highest scoring white was Cathedral Cellar 2005 Chardonnay from Paarl, South Africa. Each wine scored 92 points.
In 2008 the awards saw 1067 wines entered. Again, wines were compared against others of the same varietal or style. Results will be released on October 1, 2008 on the IVWA website and published in the October/November issue of Wine Access magazine.
Structure of the Awards.
Judges.
The IVWA carefully selects judges from across Canada. In addition to established writer-tasters who report regularly to the public in the media, the IVWA also seeks out new and emerging talent from within the industry. This blend of experienced and emerging judges, and the representation of different regions of Canada, attempts to ensure results are balanced representations of Canadian opinion.
The Tasting Process.
The IVWA diligently works to ensure results are sound. Wines are organized into flights, then tasted blind and scored independently by a panel of judges. Entries that progress to later rounds are re-scored by two additional panels that have no knowledge of the specific identity of the wines being tasted.
Categories.
The official categories of the 2008 IVWA were:

Jeff Roth

Jeff Roth is a semi-retired American professional wrestler who has competed in North American independent promotions throughout the 1990s including Florida Championship Wrestling, Future of Wrestling and the National Wrestling Alliance. A frequent tag team partner of Anthony Michaels, the two wrestled as Schmuck and Snot Dudley respectively as well as competing under the name Wild Side. He and Michaels were part of Animal House with Chris Charger and Billy Fives, a stable which dominated numerous Southeastern independent promotions during the late 1990s.
Career.
Trained by "The Wild Samoan" Afa Anoa'i, Roth wrestled for numerous Northeastern independent promotions before forming a tag team with Anthony Michaels who had left Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1995. Wrestling as Schmuck and Snot Dudley throughout the East Coast and Mid-Atlantic independent circuit, the two were among the earliest tag teams to join Bobby Rogers' Future of Wrestling promotion in 1998.
Forming a stable with Michaels, Chris Charger and Billy Fives, their stable Animal House would dominate FOW and other Southeastern promotions throughout the late 1990s. Roth, who used an underdog gimmick while in FOW, would win the FOW Lightweight Championship in addition to winning the FOW Tag Team Championship twice with Michaels and once with Charger.
On July 6, 2000, he and Michaels took part in a special wrestling event at the Boys and Girls Club of Miami in front of over 2,000 children. After defeating their opponents, Phi Delta Slam (Bruno Sassi & Big Tilly), they also gave a ""brutal paddling"" to their manager Fabulous Frank. He and Roth also competed in other Florida-based promotions that year such as Outlaw Championship Wrestling.
On April 13, Roth and Michaels were among those at FOW's fourth anniversary show at the Bergeron Arena in Davie. Appearing on the undercard in front of 3,500 fans, with the main event being a 3-way dance between Terry Funk, Abdullah the Butcher and Kevin Sullivan, they defeated Suicidal Tendencies (Dennis & Sean Allen). The event was later released in the promotion's first dvd, however their match did not appear.
Feuding with The Vandalz during 2002, he and Michaels defeated their rivals at a June 29 house show in Davie, Florida attended by over 1,500 fans.

Provisional Constitutional Order

The Provisional Constitutional Order (popularly term as PCO), is an emergency and extra-constitutional order that suspends either wholly or partially the Constitution of Pakistan— the supreme law of land. 
The PCO fulfills and act as the temporary order while the actual constitution is held in abeyance or suspension. Mostly, the orders have been enforced during the times of the martial law imposed by the armed forces of the country against the civilian governments.
Overview of Provisional Constitutional Order.
Provisional Constitutional Order, 1981.
Soon after the martial law went into immediate effect in 1977, the constitution of Pakistan was suspended. The first PCO was declared on 24 March 1981 by then-President and chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq. It was the first PCO having declared by the President General Zia-ul-Haq in the history of the country.
Under this new order, the senior justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan were asked to take an oath of office under the provisions set by the PCO. On March 1981, President Zia terminated 19 senior justices of the supreme court when they refused to take the oath. Chief Justice Dorab Patel and Senior justice Fakhrauddin Ebrahim declined to take the oath; thus opting for retirement. Interestingly, Senior justiceAnwarul Haq also resigned after refusing to take the oath whilst the Senior justice Mushtaq Hussain who was willing to take the oath was not asked to do so.
Senior justices Hussain and Haq had previously approved Bhutto's hanging were reportedly restrained to take an oath under the secretive directives issued by President Zia. All of these Senior justices were asked to tender their resignation, which they did.
Provisional Constitutional Order effecting the Judicature of Pakistan
Provisional Constitutional Order, 1999.
Political tensions arising after the border incidents with India that nearly pushed the two countries at the brink of the war, Chairman Joint chiefs and chief of army staff General Pervez Musharraf immediately imposed the martial law against conservative Prime minister Nawaz Sharif, on 14 October 1999.
General Musharraf effectively imposed the state of emergency and suspended the constitution after introducing the provisional order. Nearly, all Senior justices were forcefully required to take an oath of office under this new order, and concerns were raised that this would "erode the independence of the judiciary".
Provisional Constitutional Order effecting the Judicature of Pakistan
Provisional Constitutional Order, 2007.
In 2007, another Provisional Constitutional Order was issued by General Pervez Musharraf. The PCO was issued on November 3, 2007 and later amended on November 15, 2007. It was lifted on December 16, 2007.

Central Blues

The Central Blues are an Australian rules football club based in Toronto, Canada.
History.
The club was founded in 2005 by ex Guelph Gargoyles players Bruce Parker and Rob Chapman.
Despite being one of the newest clubs in the league, it is one of the best supported ones, this is partially due to the alignment with the AFL club by the same nickname.
In 2008 the Blues finished 5th on the league ladder and qualified for finals for the first time in the club's brief history. The Blues would go on to defeat the Guelph Gargoyles in rnd1, but experience defeat in the semis at the hand of the Broadview Hawks.
2009 saw the club finish 6th at the end of the regular season to make it into the finals for the 2nd consecutive season. The club managed to once again surprise their opponent (Toronto Dingos) to easily win their first final, only to lose to the Etobicoke Kangaroos in the preliminary final to end up 4th overall.
In 2010 the Central Blues won their first OAFL Premiership versus their downtown Toronto rivals the Toronto Dingos.
Women's Team.
In 2009 the Central Blues expanded to included Ontario's first organized Women's Australian Football team. The club plays inter-squad games as well as games versus teams such as Montreal and New York. An Ontario Women's League is in the planning stages. The Women's team was started by Bruce Parker and Sherrelle Kelly-Witt with assistance from the Central Blues' executive.

HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh

With less than 0.1 percent of the population estimated to be HIV-positive, Bangladesh is a low HIV-prevalence country.
Prevalence.
The country faces a concentrated epidemic, and its very low HIV-prevalence rate is partly due to prevention efforts, focusing on men who have sex with men, female sex workers, and intravenous drug users. Four years before the disease’s 1989 appearance in the country, the government implemented numerous prevention efforts targeting the above high-risk populations as well as migrant workers. Although these activities have helped keep the incidence of HIV down, the number of HIV-positive individuals has increased steadily since 1994 to approximately 7,500 people in 2005 according to the International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. UNAIDS estimates the number to be slightly higher at 11,000 people.
Whilst HIV prevalence is very low in the general population, amongst Most At Risk Populations (MARPs) it rises to 0.7%. In some cases it is as high as 2.7%, for instance among casual sex workers in Hili, a small border town in northwest Bangladesh. Many of the estimated 11,000 people living with HIV are migrant workers. The 2006 National AIDS/STD programme estimated that 67% of identified HIV positive cases in the country were returnee migrant workers and their spouses. This is similar to findings from other organisations. According to the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B), 47 of 259 cases of people living with HIV during the period 2002-2004 were identified during the migration process. Other data from 2004 (from the National AIDS/Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) programme of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)) shows that 57 of 102 newly reported HIV cases were among returning migrants.
While HIV prevalence among male homosexuals and sex workers has remained below 1 percent, unsafe practices among drug users, particularly needle sharing, have caused a sharp increase in the number of people infected. Measurements at one central surveillance point showed that between 2001 and 2005, incidence of HIV in IDUs more than doubled – from 1.4 percent to 4.9 percent, according to UNAIDS. In 2004, 9 percent of IDUs at one location in Dhaka were HIV-positive. Compounding the risk of an epidemic, a large proportion of IDUs (up to 20 percent in some regions) reported buying sex, fewer than 10 percent of whom said they consistently used a condom.
Preventive programs.
HIV/AIDS prevention programs have successfully reached 71.6 percent of commercial sex workers (CSWs) in Bangladesh, according to the 2005 United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) Country Report. However, only 39.8 percent of sex workers reported using a condom with their most recent client, and just 23.4 percent both correctly identified ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and rejected major misconceptions about HIV transmission. Other factors contributing to Bangladesh’s HIV/AIDS vulnerability include cross-border interaction with high-prevalence regions in Burma and northeast India, low condom use among the general population, and a general lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). For instance, a study in 2008 found poor HIV knowledge among female migrant workers who were flying for an overeas job. Research performed by Islam & Conigrave (2007) found that there were substantial gaps between current needs and the ongoing prevention efforts. The authors stressed the importance of developing a pre-departure and post-departure program for international migrants; increased coordination among intervening agencies and equitable coverage of prevention programs.
Tuberculosis.
Bangladesh also has a high tuberculosis (TB) burden, with 102 new cases per 100,000 people in 2005, according to the World Health Organization. HIV infects about 0.1 percent of adult TB patients in Bangladesh and HIV-TB co-infections complicate treatment and care for both diseases.
National response.
Bangladesh's HIV/AIDS prevention program started in 1985, when the Minister of Health and Family Welfare established the National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Program under the overall policy support of the National AIDS Council (NAC), headed by the President and chaired by the Minister of Health and Family Welfare. The National AIDS/STD Program has set in place guidelines on key issues including testing, care, blood safety, sexually transmitted infections, and prevention among youth, women, migrant populations, and sex workers. In 2004, a six-year National Strategic Plan (2004–2010) was approved. The country’s HIV policies and strategies are based on other successful family planning programs in Bangladesh and include participation from schools, as well as religious and community organizations. The AIDS Initiative Organization was launched in 2007 to fund for those without proper medication in order to combat the virus. The National HIV and AIDS Communication Strategy (2006–2010) was also developed and launched.
Since 2000, the Government of Bangladesh has worked with the World Bank on the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project, a $26 million program designed to prevent HIV from spreading within most-at-risk populations and into the general population. The program is being integrated into the country’s Health, Nutrition and Population Program, which is supported by the government and external donors. In 2003, a national youth policy was established on reproductive health, including HIV/AIDS awareness. Since 2006, students in 21,500 secondary and upper-secondary schools have been taught about HIV/AIDS issues. The educational program introduces a "life skills" curriculum, including a chapter on HIV/AIDS drafted with assistance from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
Bangladesh developed its first Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment guidelines in 2006, with PLHIV able to buy subsidised antiretroviral drugs from specified pharmacies. Unfortunately, most HIV diagnostic facilities are provided by NGOs based in Dhaka and most rural and cross-border migrants miss out on ART, HIV testing and other associated care and support services. If they seek private care, the cost is often beyond their means.
Currently, the program funded by the Global Fund is leading the national response to fight HIV and AIDS. Bangladesh had received 3 grants on HIV/AIDS from The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria- Round 2 from 2004-2009, Round 6 from 2007-2012 and Rolling Continuation Channel (RCC) from 2009-2015. The Round 2 grant focused mainly on prevention of HIV among young people with strategies including- 1. HIV/AIDS prevention messages dissemination through information campaign in mass and print media 2. HIV/AIDS orientation, training and services via Life skills education, Youth Friendly Health services and accessing condom 3. Integration of HIV/AIDS in school and college curriculum 4. Advocacy and sensitization of religious leaders, parents and policy makers 5. Generating information for policies and programs. The main focus of Round 6 grant was on Most at Risk Populations (MARP) and scaling up of the Round 2 project including interventions with vulnerable youth. The interventions for High Risk population and vulnerable young people includes essential services for injecting drug users and female sex workers; treatment, care and support for PLHIV; and awareness and prevention strategy for vulnerable young people including garment industry workers. National level capacity building, strengthening district coordination, support to networks and self-help groups are also among the strategies.
Round 2 and Round 6 has been implemented through Public-Private Partnership where Economic Relations Division of the Government of Bangladesh worked as Principal Recipient and Save the Children USA managed the grants as Management Agency in collaboration with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Based on the satisfactory level of completion of the Round 2 project, Global Fund awarded Bangladesh with the 6 year fund termed as “Rolling Continuation Channel (RCC)” from 2009-2015, which is consolidated with the Round 6 grant. For high level of performance the Project is appreciated as a” best practice” example in Asia and is rated as “A” by the Global Fund. The program is being implemented through 13 technical packages by 13 consortiums comprising 61 organizations nationwide. Save the Children, as a Principle Recipient of the grant is facilitating implementation through technical and compliance related support to all the consortia. Other Principal Recipients are National AIDS/STD Program and ICDDR,B. The main objectives of RCC Program are-

Christopher Simcox

Christopher Simcox (10 December 1909 - 1981) was an English double murderer, notable and perhaps unique in being twice sentenced to death, and twice reprieved.
Simcox, a maintenance fitter by trade, lived in Smethwick in the West Midlands of England. He was divorced by his first wife for cruelty.
Simcox murdered his second wife in 1948, and was sentenced to death at Stafford Assizes. However, in April 1948 the House of Commons had passed Sidney Silverman's amendment to the then current Criminal Justice Bill to suspend capital punishment for murder for five years. The House of Lords overturned the amendment later in the year, but in the intervening period the Home Secretary, James Chuter Ede had announced that he would reprieve all condemned prisoners until the law was settled. Between March and October 1948 26 persons, including Simcox, were thereby reprieved. Simcox served 10 years in jail, before being released on licence.
He was married, for the third time, in 1962 to Ruby Irene. In 1963 he threatened his wife with an air-pistol, but was put on probation. His wife subsequently left him, with the help of relatives. On 11 November 1963 Simcox, armed with a rifle, went in search of his wife. He shot her sister, Mrs Hilda Payton, fatally through the head, before pursuing his wife to her brother's house. There he shot them both, but they survived. Simcox then turned the gun on himself, shooting himself twice through the body, but he also survived.
In February 1964 Simcox was again tried at Stafford Assizes, and sentenced to death by Mr Justice Finnemore. The Homicide Act 1957 had restricted capital murder to a limited class of crimes, including murder with a firearm, and a second murder committed on a different occasion from the first. Simcox was eligible to be hanged on both grounds.
The wording of Simcox's sentences of death was slightly different on the two occasions. In 1948 he was sentenced "to be hanged by the neck until you are dead", while in 1964 he was sentenced "to suffer death in the manner authorised by law". This change in language was provided in the 1957 Act; the old language was considered anachronistic, as since the 1870s Britain had employed the "long-drop" method of hanging, which was held to cause near-instantaneous death.
Simcox's date of execution was set for Tuesday 17 March 1964 at Winson Green Prison, Birmingham. However, his lawyers petitioned the Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, on the grounds that Simcox was still severely injured from his self-inflicted wounds, could not walk, and would probably have to be hanged in a wheelchair. There was no precedent for postponing an execution until a prisoner was fit enough to be hanged, and there was a history of reprieving prisoners whose executions might result in an unseemly spectacle owing to existing injuries or infirmity. On 14 March 1964 Brooke announced that Simcox had been reprieved, the sentence of death automatically being replaced by life imprisonment; at that time there was no provision for attaching special conditions to such a sentence, meaning that one day Simcox might be released again, albeit on licence.
Five months later, the last-ever hangings in Britain took place, and in 1965 the death penalty was in practice abolished for murder. 
In 1969 Simcox's wife divorced him, and the civil judge in that case took the unusual step of recommending that Simcox never be released.
Simcox died in Portsmouth in early 1981, aged 71. It is currently not known whether he was still a prisoner at the time of his death.

HIV/AIDS in Indonesia

UNAIDS has said that HIV/AIDS in Indonesia is one of Asia’s fastest growing epidemics. In 2010, it is expected that 5 million Indonesians will have HIV/AIDS. In 2007, Indonesia was ranked 99th in the world by prevalence rate, but because of low understanding of the symptoms of the disease and high social stigma attached to it, only 5-10% of HIV/AIDS sufferers actually get diagnosed and treated.
History.
Indonesia’s first case of HIV was reported in 1987 and between then and 2009, 3,492 people died from the disease. Of the 11,856 cases reported in 2008, 6,962 of them were people under 30 years of age, including 55 infants under 1 year old. There are a high number of concentrated cases among Indonesia’s most at risk including injection drug users (IDUs), sex workers their partners and clients, homosexual men and infants who contract the disease through the womb or from being breast fed. 
In the last 15 years, HIV/AIDS has become an epidemic in Indonesia. The highest concentration areas are Papua, Jakarta, East Java, West Java, Bali and Riau and all are considered to be zones that need immediate attention. 
Due to the increasing number of IDUs, the number of new infections has grown rapidly since 1999. Moreover, a generalised epidemic is already under way in the provinces of Papua and West Papua, where a population-based survey found an adult-prevalence rate of 2.4% in 2006. A whopping 48% of Papuans are unaware of HIV/AIDS, and the number of AIDS cases per 100,000 people in the two provinces is almost 20 times the national average. The percentage of people who reported being unaware of HIV/AIDS increases to 74% among uneducated populations in the region.
The epidemic in Indonesia is one of the fastest growing among HIV/AIDS in Asia. The epidemic of injecting drug use continues to be the primary mode of transmission, accounting for 59% of HIV infections, and heterosexual transmission accounted for 41% in 2006. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Health, recent surveys report that more than 40% of IDUs in Jakarta have tested positive for HIV, and about 13% tested positive in West Java. Many IDUs sell sex to finance their drug habits. Yet in 2005, 25% of IDUs in Bandung, Jakarta, and Medan said they had unprotected paid sex in the last 12 months.
The Indonesian archipelago stretches more than 3,000 miles along the Equator. Cultural practices and levels of urbanization have an impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. For instance, a culture of paid and “transactional” sex among young men and women aged 15 to 24 has been a driving factor in Papua. Among 15 to 24 year olds, HIV-prevalence rates were 3% in 2006, according to the Ministry of Health. Prevalence rates among sex workers in Papua’s major urban areas ranged from 9% in Timika to 16% in Sorong in 2004.
Numerous factors put Indonesia in danger of a broader epidemic. Risky sexual behaviors are common. Only 54.7% of sex workers and 56.5% of men who have sex with men (MSM) use condoms consistently, and just 18.5 percent of IDUs consistently use both sterile needles and condoms, according to Indonesia’s 2006 report to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS). Many IDUs are also sex workers or clients of sex workers, increasing the likelihood of HIV/AIDS spreading to the general population. Awareness of HIV status among at-risk populations is low. According to a 2004–2005 study cited in the UNGASS report, 18.1% of IDUs, 15.4% of MSM, 14.8% of sex workers, and 3.3% of clients of sex workers had received HIV testing in the previous 12 months and knew their test results. Stigma and discrimination persist and many people living with HIV hide their status for fear of losing their jobs, social status, and the support of their families and communities, thus decreasing the likelihood that they will receive proper treatment and increasing the chances of HIV spreading undetected.
National response.
Indonesia established a National AIDS Commission in 1994 to focus on preventing the spread of HIV, addressing the needs of people living with HIV/AIDS, and coordinating government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private sector, and community activities. The Government of Indonesia signified its continued commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS in 2005 when it budgeted $13 million to HIV/AIDS programs, an increase of 40 percent over the amount disbursed in 2004. However, the national budget for HIV/AIDS has since been stagnant. A 2006 Presidential Regulation reinforced the Commission’s position as the The National AIDS Strategy for 2003–2007 stressed the role of prevention as the core of Indonesia’s HIV/AIDS program, while recognizing the urgent need to scale up treatment, care, and support services. The strategy emphasized the importance of conducting proper HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection (STI) surveillance; carrying out operational research; creating an enabling environment through legislation, advocacy, capacity building, and antidiscrimination efforts; and promoting sustainability. Building upon this framework, the National AIDS Strategy for 2007–2010 added the priority targets of reaching 80 percent of people most-at-risk with comprehensive prevention programs; influencing 60 percent of the most-at-risk population to change their behaviors; and providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to 80 percent of those in need.
The Government of Indonesia initiated a program to subsidise the cost of ART in 2004. By 2005, the program provided low-cost ART at 50 hospitals. However, only 20 percent of HIV-infected people received ART in 2006, according to UNAIDS, and for every one person who starts ART another six get infected. Treatment adherence continues to be a challenge in Indonesia as more often than not, people living with HIV drop out of antiretroviral therapy due to many complex factors. Other competing demands on the government such as dealing with natural disasters and other health emergencies such as avian influenza also pose challenges to sustaining the momentum of the AIDS response.
Indonesia's local governments have investigated innovative techniques to slow down the spread of the disease, including using microchip tagging technology to keep track of the infected individuals known to be sexually active.
International Help.
Indonesia receives assistance from several international donor organizations, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Global Fund approved a fourth-round grant in 2005 for Indonesia to provide comprehensive care for HIV/AIDS-infected and -affected individuals.
In 2007 Australia donated A$100 million to help contain the epidemic in Indonesia. The aim of the program is to limit the number of people who contract the disease though education of at risk groups, improve the quality of life for suffers, and reduce the socioeconomic effects on Indonesia. Australia has been assisting Indonesia to tackle HIV/AIDS for over 15 years and introduced the first methadone program to a prison in Asia, the program is now in 95 prisons across Indonesia.
America also supports Indonesia’s National Aids Program, donating US$8 million annually 
. The program aims to increase awareness of the risks and prevention methods and will work closely with NGO’s and provincial governments to develop services in areas where the spread is now considered to be an epidemic.

Mossom Boyd

Mossom Boyd (7 December 1814 – 24 July 1883) was ‘a member of the Anglo-Irish gentry,’ who, upon moving to Canada, quickly became the lumber king of the Trent.
Biography.
Early life.
Mossom Boyd was born in India to Captain Gardiner Boyd, ‘a North of Ireland officer of the Bengal Army,’ and his wife Arabella Chadwick. Both of his parents died in 1829 during the cholera epidemic, after which, Mossom Boyd and his sister Anne were sent to live with guardians in London. This unfortunate transition must have had an ill effect on the children; their behaviour was considered ‘difficult’ and they were promptly relocated to Ireland’s Derry district to live with an aunt. Boyd began to spend an increasing amount of time in the local pubs while waiting to be called upon by the British Army. After the Napoleonic Wars there were decreasing opportunities for new military recruits, and immigration to Britain’s North American colonies began to increase in response to a decline in the workforce necessary for modern production. Boyd’s choice to relocate to Canada was heavily influenced by his accomplice in pub-crawling, John Darcus.
Life in Canada.
Landing in Canada in 1834, Boyd made the long trek towards his newly acquired of land in Verulam Township. Upon arrival, Boyd eventually fell in with some of the ‘gentleman farmers, including members of the Need, Langton, and Dunsford families. The connections made with these members of the local gentry aided Boyd greatly, and allowed for his transition from working hand to an entrepreneurial giant. Anne Langton described him as a ‘most resolute home-stayer and a very industrious settler,’ who ‘has chopped all his own land himself.’ She seemed to quite admire his simple hard working nature: ‘he is a favourite of mine; he is not brilliant or animated, but has much goodness and kindness, and simplicity of character, and is an example to all our young men for industry, attention to business, and study of economy.’
In 1844 Boyd solidified his connections with John Langton and the Dunsford family by marrying Caroline Dunsford. This friendship precipitated a short-lived partnership between Boyd and John Langton. In 1845 Mossom and Caroline’s first son, Gardiner Boyd, was born. Caroline and Mossom had six children altogether: Gardiner, Anne, Mary Arabella, Caroline, Mossom Martin, and Emma Blackall. Boyd’s wife Caroline died a year after the birth of her last child, Emma, in 1857 from an unknown cause. Boyd was left with six children under twelve; this was extremely difficult for him due to the tremendous amount of energy and time necessary to maintain his business. He was concerned about the children living in Peterborough, and in great need of help Boyd contacted Letitia Magee Cust, a childhood friend from Derry. He wrote to her knowing she was still unmarried, warning her that she ‘may not find me at all what you imagine or be able to conceive what effects such a rough life may have had on me, both in appearance and in all other respects.’ Letitia agreed to undertake the long journey alone to Bobcaygeon. Upon her arrival she married Boyd and took control over house and children, eventually adding to the brood with three of her own, one of which died. The Boyd children were provided with a thorough education. Mossom Martin attended school until age six-teen when his father decided that he was needed to help with the lumbering business. One of Boyd’s other sons, William (W.T.C.) from his marriage with Letitia, was also inducted into the family business. In 1880 an addition was built over the south wing of the Boyd home; these new rooms were for Boyd’s private use during his illness. Mossom Boyd died on the evening of July 24, 1883, and was buried in the Peterborough cemetery on July 27, 1883.
Lumbering.
Boyd was a very industrious worker, clearing all of his own land upon arrival in Verulam Township. After a few years Boyd began to realize that creating a productive farm was not as profitable as he initially thought, and the demand for surplus crops was minimal. As Boyd was a bachelor, he was an excellent candidate to mind Thomas Need’s sawmill and store, on the site, which is now Bobcaygeon, while Need returned to England for business. This provided Boyd with some cash, and opportunity for future advancement. Need increasingly relied on Boyd to look after his property and mill as he made more and more frequent trips to England. On March 15, 1843 Need began leasing ‘part of lot 15 in Concession X, Verulam, the mill reserve, with “gristmill, sawmill and tenement thereon”, for a term of seven years,’ costing £40 per annum to Boyd. The same year as Boyd’s marriage to Caroline (1844) Need received his inheritance, which enabled him to permanently return to England. Boyd’s early introduction into the lumbering trade, and partnership with John Langton in 1849 allowed for much needed financial aid and advice. Langton writes about Boyd: 
‘Boyd is an Irishman whose blood got an extra boiling by being born in India… Boyd is admirably adapted in many respects for the work he is at. When a raft is once started almost everything must yield to dispatch, and a restless being who can keep himself and everything that comes in contact with him in a state of excitement for two or three months at a time is just the man to drive a river.” 
Unfortunately, owing to ill-health, Boyd and Langton’s partnership did not last, and upon his recovery in 1851, Langton made a smooth transition from lumbering to politics.
On July 1, 1851, Need had a new lease contracted for 21 years with an annual rent of £15 a year for the first seven years, after five years Boyd would have the power to purchase for £500. By paying £100 a year Boyd was able to pay for the, roughly , and two mills by September 13, 1855.
Quebec.
The European market for white pine, oak, and elm offered great opportunities for Canadian Lumbermen. The Quebec City harbour was ideal for the lumber trade, with its gently sloping shore, and a very firm bottom. This allowed timbers and spars to be stocked on shore for shipment, and the incoming tide enabled them to be easily floated when necessary. Local merchants were able to make a sizable profit from the space they rented in their coves for the logs, and rafts. At this point the logs would be measured, culled, and graded, as standardized by the Canadian government in 1808. Driving the logs to Quebec was worth the time and effort, the American demand on Canadian timber forced competitive prices from Great Britain, keeping the price on the Quebec market high. The superior quality of Boyd’s pine logs gave Boyd a cutting edge in the vicious Quebec market. 
Boyd manned his first river driving expedition to Quebec City in 1848, with the help of a neighbour, Kelly. Boyd was in need of some ready money, and he believed that he had gained the necessary skills to successfully make it to Quebec with the masts. He began his journey early in the spring, but the strong current caused by melting snow and heavy rainfall did not help their passage, and they did not reach Peterborough until July, three months after they began. At this point Kelly dropped out, but Boyd decided to stick it out, and although he did not reach Quebec until late in the season, he managed to sell all of the pine. 
The following year, Boyd formed a partnership with John Langton and James Dunsford, but neither had the enthusiasm for the Quebec trade that Boyd did; both soon removed themselves from the business. Langton remained involved with Boyd after he withdrew, often backing Boyd when his credit was low. After 1851 Boyd was on his own, facing many hardships during the years to come, but his determination outlasted his difficulties. Boyd was one of the last lumbermen to dabble in the Quebec market. Mossom Boyd continued, until the bitter end, to make the trip down to Quebec. He never tired of this journey mentioning that: ‘travelling on our own back lakes, one never tires of that.’
Expansion.
Around the 1850s Mossom Boyd realized the necessity of expanding his lumbering activities. He purchased Crown land ‘in the northern part of Verulam as well as in Somerville and Harvey townships.’ Boyd was able to clear these lands of their best pine, and later sell them to prospective settlers. These partially cleared lands were a more favourable purchase for the settlers, who often found clearing heavily forested areas too daunting a task. 
In the 1860s the Department of Crown lands began to realize the advantages of having land cleared before settlement commenced. The Crown auctioned rights to clear Snowdon, Glamorgan, and Monmouth townships, which Boyd was able to acquire. The length of time these limits would remain available to Boyd was not guaranteed, so he was reluctant to expand without gaining a contract that would survive a minimum of ten years. The opportune moment came when The Canadian Land & Emigration Company decided to purchase the townships in 1861, in the area, which is now Haliburton. The Canadian Land and Emigration Company had very few families, less than eighty, move into the area they had purchased. They decided to sell one township to the lumbering company Thompson and Dodge, due to lack of interest, and poor land for farming. The outright sale of the land angered member, C.R. Stewart, forcing him to resign, and to request his brother Hartley Stewart to intervene. ‘He advised that the company should get a reliable lumberman to harvest the large trees in the other nine townships in an orderly fashion.’ As it was primarily the Trent water system in this area, this contract was an excellent opportunity for Boyd to gain some capitol. Boyd was able to get the cutting rights on Canadian Land & Emigration Company Land for ten years.
Boyd had expansive limits in Ottawa and Quebec, and by 1882 he had begun sending rangers to explore Nipissing, Manitoba, and Minnesota. A Gravenhurst firm cut the lumber from his land in Havelock, which was later, shipped into Buffalo. At the time of his death, lumbering around northern Peterborough had come to a halt, as well as in Burnt River. His last timber raft went to Quebec in 1883.
Legacy.
Mossom Boyd’s humble beginnings in Bobcaygeon grew into unimagined success. The lumbering empire begun by Boyd was taken over by his two sons: Mossom Martin Boyd, and William Thornton Cust Boyd who expanded the empire, which lasted until the First World War. The Boyd family left a lasting legacy on the village of Bobcaygeon.

American Cat Fanciers Association

The American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) is an American non-profit organization formed with the intent of allowing for greater flexibility in the development of pedigreed cats.
The ACFA has become one of the largest cat registries in the world for purebred, pedigreed cats, experimental breeds of cats, and household pet cats.
ACFA sanctioned cat shows include classes for championship adult cats, championship altered cats, registered kittens from the age of four to eight months, and household pet cats. Wins from licensed shows can be used to claim titles including championships and multiple championships, grand championships and multiple grand championships, and the household pet titles of Royal Household Pet and Supreme Household Pet.
ACFA is directly affiliated with the Cat Aficionado Association of China, who use the ACFA breed standards.
Founding.
ACFA was founded in 1955 by a group of cat fanciers desiring to show their cats in a democratic association, that is, one where individual members had voting rights on election of officers, acceptance of new show rules, by-laws and breed standards and acceptance of new breeds of cats.

HIV/AIDS in Jordan

Prevalence.
Jordan has low HIV/AIDS prevalence, but if preventive measures are not implemented, HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases could increase or re-emerge and have significant social and economic consequences.
In 2007, there were an estimated 380,000 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in the region, according to UNAIDS. Although figures are low compared with southern Africa or Asia, they are still a cause for alarm, particularly since they are rising rapidly, especially among high-risk groups, such as injecting drug users (IDUs) and vulnerable youth. Systematic monitoring of the epidemic, however, is far from complete. Surveillance systems remain inadequate in their coverage of at-risk groups and thus fail to reflect risk behaviors or provide incidence and prevalence rates.
In addition to weak surveillance, the adoption of preventive practices is very limited, the participation of PLWHA and civil society in the HIV/AIDS response is still nascent, and despite some progress, general attitudes, institutions, and laws often do not facilitate implementation of an expanded response. The first step in addressing the spread of HIV/AIDS is recognizing the presence of the disease and the sociocultural, political, and economic patterns that fuel and bear the burden of its impact.
Although the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported that 550 cases of HIV/AIDS were diagnosed in Jordan as of December 2007, the actual number is thought to be much higher due to under-reporting. For those cases diagnosed, the routes of transmission included 16.5 percent through blood and blood products, 60 percent through sexual transmission, and 3.3 percent through injection drug use. Perinatal HIV transmission accounted for 1.5 percent, and 18.2 percent of cases were of unknown transmission route. In addition, a significant number of diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases are from foreigners in Jordan (185 Jordanians and 365 non-Jordanians). Since the first case of HIV/AIDS in Jordan was diagnosed in 1986, 85 Jordanians have died of AIDS. Little is known about HIV prevalence rates in high-risk populations in Jordan.
A 2003 assessment conducted of about 1,200 women presenting to obstetrics and gynecological clinics in urban centers in Amman, Zarka, and Rusaifah showed a prevalence of gonorrhea of 0.7 percent, chlamydial infection of 1.2 percent, trichomoniasis of 1.2 percent, bacterial vaginosis of 5.4 percent, and candidiasis of 19.1 percent. Regional variations indicate that rates are much higher in some sites than in others. No syphilis infection was identified.
Stigma and discrimination against PLWHA prevails, as 29 percent of ever-married women surveyed in the 2002 Demographic and Health Survey were unwilling to care for PLWHA at home, while 63.5 percent of young people responding to a knowledge, attitude, practice, and behavior study believed that AIDS patients should be isolated.
Jordan’s cultural sensitivities pose the greatest threat to the country’s low prevalence. Because of difficulties in discussing sexual matters, many Jordanians still harbor misconceptions about HIV/AIDS and PLWHA. A 2005 study of the general population (USAID/JHU/HCP: 2005 Communication Partnership for Family Health Baseline Survey, Key Results) found that talking about HIV/AIDS is still taboo and that PLWHA still face stigma and discrimination. For instance, 65 percent of women and men said people with the AIDS virus should not be allowed to work with others in shops, offices, or on farms, even if they are not feeling sick. Many people responding to the survey did not understand how to prevent HIV/AIDS and did not know that condoms can be used for this purpose.
At an estimated two new cases of tuberculosis (TB) per 100,000 people (WHO 2005), TB incidence in Jordan is relatively low. Currently, fewer than 1 percent of adult TB patients are HIV-positive. However, continued monitoring is necessary because an increase in the incidence of HIV-TB co-infection could add to the complexity of fighting both diseases in Jordan.
National response.
Jordan’s national response to HIV/AIDS is characterized by strong political commitment to addressing HIV. The response is managed through the MOH National AIDS Program (NAP) and includes the formation of a National AIDS Committee and the appointment of an AIDS program manager. The MOH
continues to support the national blood transfusion service, mandatory HIV testing, strong control measures for foreigners who reside in Jordan, and provision of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for Jordanians who test HIV-positive. There are currently 12 part-time focal point persons who are responsible for HIV/AIDS in all governorates of the country.
In 2005, Jordan launched the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (2005–2009), outlining the key goals, objectives, and initiatives for the response. The key goal is to maintain low HIV prevalence among the population and all vulnerable sub-populations of Jordan.
Jordan has received funding from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to strengthen and expand existing HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and support activities since 2003. In July 2007, the MOH was granted $1.25 million from the Global Fund to maintain low HIV prevalence among its population.
