Biography.
On July 1, 1984, Doris Self made video game history when, at the age of 58, she gained recognition as the "world's oldest video game champion." As a competitor on Q*Bert at Twin Galaxies 1984 Video Game Masters Tournament, Doris scored a world record mark of 1,112,300 points on Twin Galaxies' Tournament Settings (TGTS) -- the most difficult settings that allow for only five-men in the game.
In 2005, Doris traveled to London to continue her quest to regain the Q*Bert World Record. She was one of the featured stars at the Classic Gaming Expo-UK, held Saturday, August 13, 2005 in Croydon, United Kingdom. As an honorary member of the U.S. National Video Game Team, she was part of a contingent of video gamers who traveled to Paris, France on Napoleon's birthday (August 15, 2005) to hand-deliver an tall proclamation signed by hundreds of British players that challenged Paris to a London vs. Paris video game championship.
During the weekend of April 6–9, 2006, Doris Self faced-off against Kelly Tharp, of Sellersburg, Indiana, in a highly publicized Q*Bert showdown, held at Apollo Amusements in Pompano Beach, Florida. Titled the "The King vs The Queen Q*Bert Smackdown," the event was filmed as part of the "King of Kong" movie.
In the 2007 Guinness World Records Book, Doris was recognized as the world's oldest video game competitor. In "The King of Kong", Doris' quest to recover her standing as the "oldest champion" was documented, as she tried to regain the title back from John Lawton, the 72-year old co-founder of the Funspot Family Fun Center in Weirs Beach, New Hampshire, who had captured the world title on Depth Charge.
Doris was still practicing and preparing for her next world record attempt on Q*Bert when she died from injuries suffered in an automobile accident in Plantation, Florida on October 3, 2006.
Doris' Q*Bert career was not the first time that she had made her mark on history. At the age of 19, she was among the first female flight attendants at Eastern Air Lines, graduating in 1945 as a member of Eastern Air Lines’ first class of airline stewardesses. And, in 1954, while working with legendary air ace Eddie Rickenbacker, she co-organized "The Silver Liners," history’s first association for ex-stewardesses. Today, the DC-3 Doris used to fly on back in the 1940s is hanging from the ceiling of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

Rosetta Stoned

"Rosetta Stoned" is a song by the American rock band Tool. It was released on May 2, 2006, as the eighth track off their fourth studio album, "10,000 Days".
Structurally, the song contains complex fast-to-slow drum fills, performed by the band's drummer Danny Carey. The song mostly uses Quintuple meter time signature and is characterised by its aggressive riffs. The song also features unconventional percussion instruments and polyrhythms.
The name of the song is a reference to the Rosetta Stone. Lyrically, the song deals with a man's encounter with aliens, spiritual realizations and his state of coma after the incident. The song is written in a stream of consciousness style and contains references to the Birkenstocks.
The preceding track in the album, "Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)" serves as a conceptually synchronized prologue for the song. It depicts a conversation between a patient (Albert Hofmann), a nurse and the doctor (R. Gordon Wasson), which occurs after the event in Rosetta Stoned.
The song generally received positive reviews by the critics. Nevertheless, it was criticized by some for its lyrics (which include extensive use of profanity) and Maynard James Keenan's experimental vocal delivery. It was also praised for its arranging and performing skills, especially due to Danny Carey's "multi-limbed" percussion skills and creative drumming. Critics also likened the song to The Grateful Dead's works. The similarities between this song and another Tool song, "Third Eye," also have been noted. Nick Cowen from Drowned in Sound gave a positive review to the song with appreciating its narration, intense mood and guitar work. The song was also musically compared to an extensive jam.

Kangaroo leather

Kangaroo leather is a strong light weight leather derived from the hide of kangaroo. 
Kangaroos are harvested. Both the meat and the hides are sold. Although most species of macropod are protected from hunting by law, a small number of the large-sized species which exist in high numbers can be hunted by commercial hunters. This policy has been criticised by some wildlife activists.
Applications.
The leather is used in a wide variety of shoes. The unique structure of kangaroo leather allows it to be cut down to very thin substance (thickness of the leather) but still retain strength. 
Kangaroo leather is also popular in manufacture of motorbike leathers and is used to make a wide variety of other applications such as car upholstery, military boots, football boots and fashion accessories.
Kangaroo leather is the material of choice for whip makers as the strips can be cut thin to keep the whip flexible, without sacrificing durability.
Properties.
Studies conducted by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) confirm that kangaroo is one of the strongest leathers of similar substance available.
Similarly when split into thinner substances kangaroo retains considerably more of the original tensile strength of the unsplit leather than does calf. When split to 20% of original thickness kangaroo retains between 30 to 60% of the tensile strength of the unsplit hide. Calf on the other hand split to 20% of original thickness retains only 1-4% of original strength. 
Kangaroo leather is lighter and stronger than the hide of a cow or goat. It has 10 times the tensile strength of cowhide and is 50% stronger than goatskin.
Studies of the morphology of kangaroo leather help explain its particular properties. 
The collagen fibre bundles in cattle hide are arranged in a complex weaving pattern. The fibres are often at angles as much as 90 degrees to the skin surface. Cattle hide also contain sweat glands, erector pili muscles and a distinct gradation in elastin levels, concentrated in the upper part of the skin. Kangaroo on the other hand has been shown to have a highly uniform orientation of fibre bundles in parallel with the skin surface. It does not contain sweat glands or erector pili muscles and elastin is evenly distributed throughout the skin thickness. This structural uniformity explains both the greater tensile strength of the whole leather and the greater retention of strength in splits. Bovine skin is much more complex in cross section. Hence in whole section it has many more weak points from which tears can start when placed under tension. In addition when sliced into splits the collagen fibres running at significant angles to the skin surface will be cut. These then become weak points in the structural strength.
Environmental aspects.
The Australian kangaroo industry produces a range of meat and leather products from animals harvested from the wild under strict government controlled Management Plans. These ensure the harvest is sustainable and humane.
A wide cross section of Australian ecologists support the kangaroo industry as being both sustainable and environmentally wise. Many argue kangaroos, which are native to Australia, are a more environmentally friendly livestock option than introduced sheep and cattle. The two most important facets of Kangaroos' better ecological fit than European agricultural animals relate to their adaptation to Australia's aridity. Kangaroos have small chest development and so require less water to breathe than placental mammals, which usually must expand a diaphragm. This means they lose more moisture in respiration. Kangaroos just make small pants while immobile and in motion expand and contract their lungs effectively using their leg muscles. The belly flops up and down, contracting and expanding the lungs respectively. Also, the kangaroo's paw is softer and does not compact the ground as hoofed cattle and sheep do. Instead, its hopping leaves very small bowl-shaped cuts in the surface of even dry clay soil, which let native grass seeds carried on the wind settle into them. The bowl shape concentrates any moisture that may fall into it into a wet point that the grass seed can use to germinate. Thus, kangaroos deplete the water table at a slower rate than cattle or sheep and would even be viable in the absence of any bore water at all. The ecological arguments for kangaroos replacing sheep and cattle as arid land livestock are compelling, though they must be set against objections of kangaroos' lack of domestication and breeding rate.
Kangaroos are eaten in most states of the union.

Bloodville, New York

Bloodville is a hamlet of Ballston Spa, Saratoga County, New York State.
History.
It is named after Isaiah Blood, who operated the Ballston Axe & Scythe Works beginning in 1831.
The factories were located on the Kayaderosseras Creek just north of Ballston Spa, and consisted of the lower mill, for the manufacture of axes, and the upper mill, for the manufacture of scythes. Several fires destroyed the two enterprises, but they were rebuilt at a much greater capacity in the 1860s.
From Nathaniel Bartlett Sylvester's "History of Saratoga County, New York," 1878:
"The edge tool property remained in the hands of its founders until Blood's death in November, 1870; it then passed into the hands of his son-in-law, Henry Knickerbocker, a banker and broker in New York. The business requires from 200 to 250 hands. The quantity of goods sold yearly is simply immense - twelve thousand dozen of scythes, eight thousand dozen of axes, and ten thousand dozen of other tools."
Bloodville also contained the lumber-yard, planing mill, and sash factory of Benjamin Barber, who was the inventor and manufacturer of a popular and nationally renowned water wheel.
During its peak in the 1890s, the hamlet contained several stores, churches, a schoolhouse, and a trolley railroad called The Ballston Terminal Railroad. The tool factories were purchased by the American Axe & Tool Company (the hard edge tool trust) in 1892, but ten years later, both enterprises were completely destroyed in two separate fires. Today the hamlet is a popular residential area.

Książ Wielki is a village in Miechów County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Książ Wielki. It lies approximately north-east of Miechów and north of the regional capital Kraków. The village has a population of 820.
The settlement of Książ Wielki was for the first time mentioned in 1120, in chronicles of a Cysterian monastery in Jędrzejów. In the late 14th century the village belonged to Spytek of Melsztyn, and it gained town rights some time between 1333 - 1370. At that time, Książ Wielki belonged to Lesser Poland’s Krakow Voivodeship, and until the Partitions of Poland was the seat of a county, which included such locations, as Miechów, Wolbrom and Jędrzejów. In the 16th century, the town had a parish school, and was an important center of the Protestant Reformation, especially of Calvinism. In 1795 Książ Wielki was annexed by Austria (see Partitions of Poland), and in 1815 it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Kingdom. In 1875, as a punishment for participation of its inhabitants in the January Uprising, the Russians reduced Książ Wielki to the status of a village. During World War II, the Germans opened here a ghetto in 1942. Most of Jewish population was killed in the Holocaust, and in early August 1944, the Germans burned down the village, killing 12 people for their support of the Home Army.
Książ Wielki has a Holy Spirit church (1381), and St. Wojciech parish church from the 14th century. There also is a Renaissance palace (1585 - 1595), destroyed during the Kościuszko Uprising, and rebuilt in neo-Gothic style (1841-1846), as well as a syngagogue (1846).

Laguna Canyon

Laguna Canyon (also called Cañada de las Lagunas, Spanish: Lagoon Canyon) is the name of a canyon that cuts through the San Joaquin Hills in southern Orange County, California, in the United States, directly west of the city of Irvine. The canyon runs from northeast to southwest, drained on the east side by tributaries of San Diego Creek and on the west by Laguna Canyon Creek. It is deeper and more rugged on the southwestern end near Laguna Beach. 
Geologically, the canyon likely originated millions of years ago as the result of San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills. Uplift diverted that stream to its present course, leaving Laguna Canyon as a wind gap. California State Route 133 runs the entire length of the canyon connecting Laguna Beach and Irvine, while California State Route 73 crosses it, running southeast-northwest. A majority of the canyon is located within the Laguna Coast Wilderness; small portions are part of Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park and the cities of Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo.
Geography and geology.
Laguna Canyon is approximately long and wide at the widest points. The city of Irvine lies to the northeast, Lake Forest and Aliso Viejo to the east, the undeveloped San Joaquin Hills to the west, and Laguna Beach to the south. The drainage divide of the canyon near its northern end separates Laguna Canyon Creek from the San Diego Creek watershed.
State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, winds through Laguna Canyon for the entire length of the gorge. California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section of the canyon is part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness, while the upper section also has a few smaller wilderness preserves. The upper section contains the Laguna Lakes, a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake of the canyon. A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme of the canyon lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.
The canyon was most likely formed by San Diego Creek cutting through the rising San Joaquin Hills over a span of about 1.22 million years. At some point, however, the creek changed course, and the water gap it had formed was walled off by the mountains and became a separate watershed. The gradient of the drainage divide separating Laguna Canyon and the San Diego Creek watershed is very small, allowing for the canyon's modern use as a transportation route.
The creek.
Laguna Canyon Creek begins as an ephemeral creek draining a mountainside west of the valley floor down into the canyon. It is briefly culverted where it crosses under Laguna Canyon Road, but most of the upper course flows in a natural channel. It soon passes the Laguna Lakes and receives Little Sycamore Canyon from the right; this creek drains a narrow side canyon which runs about eastward. The creek continues southward, and then passes beneath Laguna Canyon Rd. again and receives Camarillo Canyon, a short and steep tributary, from the right.
The stream then runs south under the twin California State Route 73 bridges and enters an underground culvert beneath an onramp. While in this culvert, Laurel Canyon (which harbors a waterfall) and larger Willow Canyon join from the right, then about later, the creek re-emerges from underground and flows in a riprap lined channel for the next few miles. It receives its major tributary, El Toro Creek, from the left. El Toro Creek, which follows El Toro Road for much of its length, drains parts of Laguna Hills and Aliso Viejo before emptying into Laguna Canyon Creek.
The creek turns sharply west and then back south, then shortly after, is forced into a concrete-lined box culvert that carries it through downtown Laguna Beach (This stretch is also known as Broadway Creek.) It then is diverted completely underground and its channel winds to an outfall at Main Beach, one of the most popular beaches in Laguna Beach.
Modifications.
Laguna Canyon and its side tributaries have received some flood control modifications. These include debris basins at the mouth of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined flood control channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called "retention basins", are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few flood control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.
There is little development within the main canyon, although the El Toro Creek area is primarily residential. There is also some residential and commercial development downstream of State Route 73. The concrete channel in this area is small and undersized for major floods, which caused it to overflow in the late 1990s and again in 2010.
Wildlife.
Animals.
The Laguna Canyon area supports a variety of native Southern California wildlife, including large mammals such as mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes and mule deer. Like Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park to the south, the canyon supports over one hundred species of birds. Some of its endangered species include California Gnatcatcher, Cactus Wren, and Orange-throated whiptail. Except for the Laguna Lakes, the canyon has no fish habitat, and riparian habitat is sparse because the local creeks have only seasonal flow.
Plants.
The dominant vegetation cover of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 years after the beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to California, are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and sagebrush.
Recreation.
Laguna Canyon forms the center section of an approximately strip of wilderness preserve running northeast-southwest along the Pacific coast. Most of the canyon is covered by Laguna Coast Wilderness, which extends over . It is bordered on the south by Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park, and on its north by Crystal Cove State Park. The parks are managed by the County of Orange and the California Department of Fish and Game, while portions of Laguna Coast are also owned by the City of Laguna Beach. Although there is no trail that follows the main canyon (as it is traversed by State Route 133), there are many trails, mostly hiking, that lead up narrow side canyons, as well as a trail that circumnavigates Laguna Lakes. Several connecting trails run east-south towards Aliso and Wood Canyons, providing access between the two watersheds.

Hydaspitherium

Hydaspitherium is an extinct genus of giraffidae.
Giraffids are represented in the late Miocene of the Siwaliks by large Sivatheriinae such as "Sivatherium", "Bramatherium", "Helladotherium", and "Hydaspitherium". It has been proposed that "Hydapitherium" is synonymous with "Bramatherium". "H. megacephalum" is restricted to the Dhok Pathan Formation (, paleocoordinates ) in northern Pakistan.
Four separate species of "Hydaspitherium" were described more than a century ago, but concluded that their differences can be explained as sexual dimorphism and intraspecific variability: "H. birmanicum" () is based on a single right upper molar. "H. grande" () and "H. magnum" (Pilgrim 1910) are only slightly larger than "H. megacephalum" and the variation in dentition does not support separate taxa. Bhatti et al. 2012 accepted two species in the Siwaliks: the smaller "H. megacephalum" and the larger "H. grande" until more material has been collected.

Sexually transmitted disease

Sexually transmitted diseases (STD), also referred to as sexually transmitted infections (STI) and venereal diseases (VD), are illnesses that have a significant probability of transmission between humans by means of sexual behavior, including vaginal intercourse, anal sex and oral sex. Some STIs can also be contracted by using IV drug needles after their use by an infected person, as well as through childbirth or breastfeeding.
Sexually transmitted infections have been well known for hundreds of years, and venereology is the branch of medicine that studies these diseases. While in the past, these illnesses have mostly been referred to as STDs or VD, in recent years the term "sexually transmitted infections" ("STIs") has been preferred, as it has a broader range of meaning; a person may be "infected", and may potentially infect others, without having a "disease".
There are 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections every year in the United States, and, in 2005, the World Health Organization estimated that 448 million people aged 15–49 were being infected a year with curable STIs (such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia).
Classification.
Until the 1990s, STIs were commonly known as "venereal diseases", the word venereal being derived from the Latin word venereus, and meaning relating to sexual intercourse or desire, ultimately derived from Venus, the Roman goddess of love. "Social disease" was a phrase used as a euphemism.
"Sexually transmitted infection" is a broader term than "sexually transmitted disease." An infection is a colonization by a parasitic species, which may not cause any adverse effects. In a disease, the infection leads to impaired or abnormal function. In either case, the condition may not exhibit signs or symptoms. Increased understanding of infections like HPV, which infects a significant portion of sexually active individuals but cause disease in only a few has led to increased use of the term "STI." Public health officials originally introduced the term "sexually transmitted infection", which clinicians are increasingly using alongside the term "sexually transmitted disease" in order to distinguish it from the former.
"STD" may refer only to infections that are causing diseases, or it may be used more loosely as a synonym for "STI." Most of the time, people do not know that they are infected with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term "sexually transmissible disease" is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, meningitis is transmissible by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an STI because sexual contact is not the primary vector for the pathogens that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means "other than sexual contact". In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact, but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated means—blood transfusion, sharing of hypodermic needles—are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact.
The diseases on this list are most commonly transmitted solely by sexual activity. Many infectious diseases, including the common cold, influenza, pneumonia, and most others that are transmitted person-to-person can also be transmitted during sexual contact, if one person is infected, due to the close contact involved. However, even though these diseases may be transmitted during sex, they are not considered STIs.
Cause.
Transmission.
The risks and transmission probabilities of sexually transmitted diseases are summarized by act in the table to the right.
Main types.
Sexually transmitted infections include:
Pathophysiology.
Many STIs are (more easily) transmitted through the mucous membranes of the penis, vulva, rectum, urinary tract and (less often—depending on type of infection) the mouth, throat, respiratory tract and eyes. The visible membrane covering the head of the penis is a mucous membrane, though it produces no mucus (similar to the lips of the mouth). Mucous membranes differ from skin in that they allow certain pathogens into the body. The amount of contact with infective sources which causes infection varies with each pathogen but in all cases a disease may result from even light contact from fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto a mucous membrane.
This is one reason that the probability of transmitting many infections is far higher from sex than by more casual means of transmission, such as non-sexual contact—touching, hugging, shaking hands—but it is not the only reason. Although mucous membranes exist in the mouth as in the genitals, many STIs seem to be easier to transmit through oral sex than through deep kissing. According to a safe sex chart, many infections that are easily transmitted from the mouth to the genitals or from the genitals to the mouth are much harder to transmit from one mouth to another. With HIV, genital fluids happen to contain much more of the pathogen than saliva. Some infections labeled as STIs can be transmitted by direct skin contact. Herpes simplex and HPV are both examples. KSHV, on the other hand, may be transmitted by deep-kissing but also when saliva is used as a sexual lubricant.
Depending on the STI, a person may still be able to spread the infection if no signs of disease are present. For example, a person is much more likely to spread herpes infection when blisters are present than when they are absent. However, a person can spread HIV infection at any time, even if he/she has not developed symptoms of AIDS.
"All" sexual behaviors that involve contact with the bodily fluids of another person should be considered to contain some risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Most attention has focused on controlling HIV, which causes AIDS, but each STI presents a different situation.
As may be noted from the name, sexually transmitted diseases are "transmitted" from one person to another by certain sexual activities rather than being actually "caused by" those sexual activities. Bacteria, fungi, protozoa or viruses are still the causative agents. It is not possible to catch any sexually transmitted disease from a sexual activity with a person who is not carrying a disease; conversely, a person who has an STI got it from contact (sexual or otherwise) with someone who had it, or his/her bodily fluids. Some STIs such as HIV can be transmitted from mother to child either during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
Although the likelihood of transmitting various diseases by various sexual activities varies a great deal, in general, all sexual activities between two (or more) people should be considered as being a two-way route for the transmission of STIs, i.e., "giving" or "receiving" are both risky although receiving carries a higher risk.
Healthcare professionals suggest safer sex, such as the use of condoms, as the most reliable way of decreasing the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases during sexual activity, but safer sex should by no means be considered an absolute safeguard. The transfer of and exposure to bodily fluids, such as blood transfusions and other blood products, sharing injection needles, needle-stick injuries (when medical staff are inadvertently jabbed or pricked with needles during medical procedures), sharing tattoo needles, and childbirth are other avenues of transmission. These different means put certain groups, such as medical workers, and haemophiliacs and drug users, particularly at risk.
Recent epidemiological studies have investigated the networks that are defined by sexual relationships between individuals, and discovered that the properties of sexual networks are crucial to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. In particular, assortative mixing between people with large numbers of sexual partners seems to be an important factor.
It is possible to be an asymptomatic carrier of sexually transmitted diseases. In particular, sexually transmitted diseases in women often cause the serious condition of pelvic inflammatory disease.
Prevention.
Prevention is key in addressing incurable STIs, such as HIV and herpes. Sexual health clinics promote the use of condoms and provide outreach for at-risk communities.
The most effective way to prevent sexual transmission of STIs is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Not all sexual activities involve contact: cybersex, phonesex or masturbation from a distance are methods of avoiding contact. Proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk. Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom.
Both partners should get tested for STIs before initiating sexual contact, or before resuming contact if a partner engaged in contact with someone else. Many infections are not detectable immediately after exposure, so enough time must be allowed between possible exposures and testing for the tests to be accurate. Certain STIs, particularly certain persistent viruses like HPV, may be impossible to detect with current medical procedures.
Many diseases that establish permanent infections can so occupy the immune system that other diseases become more easily transmitted. The innate immune system led by defensins against HIV can prevent transmission of HIV when viral counts are very low, but if busy with other viruses or overwhelmed, HIV can establish itself. Certain viral STI's also greatly increase the risk of death for HIV infected patients.
Vaccines.
Vaccines are available that protect against some viral STIs, such as Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and some types of HPV. Vaccination before initiation of sexual contact is advised to assure maximal protection.
Condoms.
Condoms and female condoms only provide protection when used properly as a barrier, and only to and from the area that it covers. "Uncovered areas are still susceptible to many STDs". In the case of HIV, sexual transmission routes almost always involve the penis, as HIV cannot spread through unbroken skin, thus "properly shielding the insertive penis with a properly worn condom from the vagina or anus effectively stops HIV transmission". An infected fluid to broken skin borne direct transmission of HIV would not be considered "sexually transmitted", but can still theoretically occur during sexual contact, this can be avoided simply by not engaging in sexual contact when having open bleeding wounds. Other STIs, even viral infections, can be prevented with the use of latex, polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms as a barrier. Some microorganisms and viruses are small enough to pass through the pores in natural skin condoms, but are still too large to pass through latex or synthetic condoms.
Proper usage entails:
Not following the first five guidelines above perpetuates the common misconception that condoms are not tested or designed properly.
In order to best protect oneself and the partner from STIs, the old condom and its contents should be assumed to be infectious. Therefore the old condom must be properly disposed of. A new condom should be used for each act of intercourse, as multiple usage increases the chance of breakage, defeating the effectiveness as a barrier.
Nonoxynol-9.
Researchers had hoped that nonoxynol-9, a vaginal microbicide would help decrease STI risk. Trials, however, have found it ineffective and it may put women at a higher risk of HIV infection.
Diagnosis.
STI tests may test for a single infection, or consist of a number of individual tests for any of a wide range of STIs, including tests for syphilis, trichomonas, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, hepatitis and HIV tests. No procedure tests for all infectious agents.
STI tests may be used for a number of reasons:
Not all STIs are symptomatic, and symptoms may not appear immediately after infection. In some instances a disease can be carried with no symptoms, which leaves a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Depending on the disease, some untreated STIs can lead to infertility, chronic pain or even death. Early identification and treatment results in less chance to spread disease, and for some conditions may improve the outcomes of treatment.
There is often a window period after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test.
Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional. One report indicated that afflicted people turn to the Internet rather than to a medical professional for information on STIs to a higher degree than for other sexual problems.
Management.
High-risk exposure such as that which occurs in rape cases may be treated prophylactically using antibiotic combinations such as azithromycin, cefixime, and metronidazole.
An option for treating partners of patients (index cases) diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea is patient-delivered partner therapy, which is the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of index cases by providing prescriptions or medications to the patient to take to his/her partner without the health care provider first examining the partner.
Epidemiology.
[[File:STDs excluding HIV world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|Age-standardized, disability-adjusted life years for STDs ("excluding HIV") per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. 
STD incidence rates remain high in most of the world, despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances that can rapidly render patients with many STDs noninfectious and cure most. In many cultures, changing sexual morals and oral contraceptive use have eliminated traditional sexual restraints, especially for women, and both physicians and patients have difficulty dealing openly and candidly with sexual issues. Additionally, development and spread of drug-resistant bacteria (e.g., penicillin-resistant gonococci) makes some STDs harder to cure. The effect of travel is most dramatically illustrated by the rapid spread of the AIDS virus (HIV-1) from Africa to Europe and the Americas in the late 1970s.
In 1996, the World Health Organization estimated that more than 1 million people were being infected daily. About 60% of these infections occur in young people <25 years of age, and of these 30% are <20 years. Between the ages of 14 and 19, STIs occur more frequently in girls than boys by a ratio of nearly 2:1; this equalizes by age 20. An estimated 340 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis occurred throughout the world in 1999.
Commonly reported prevalences of STIs among sexually active adolescent girls both with and without lower genital tract symptoms include chlamydia (10–25%), gonorrhea (3–18%), syphilis (0–3%), Trichomonas vaginalis (8–16%), and herpes simplex virus (2–12%). Among adolescent boys with no symptoms of urethritis, isolation rates include chlamydia (9–11%) and gonorrhea (2–3%). At least one in four U.S. teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease, a CDC study found. Among girls who admitted ever having sex, the rate was 40%.
AIDS is the single largest cause of mortality in present-day Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of HIV infections are acquired through unprotected sexual relations between partners, one of whom has HIV. Approximately 1.1 million persons are living with HIV/AIDS in the United States, and AIDS remains the leading cause of death among African American women between ages 25 and 34. Hepatitis B is also classed as a sexually transmitted disease because it can be passed on sexually. The disease is found globally, with the highest rates in Asia and Africa and lower rates in the Americas and Europe. Worldwide, an estimated two billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus.
History.
The first well-recorded European outbreak of what is now known as syphilis occurred in 1494 when it broke out among French troops besieging Naples. From this centre, the disease swept across Europe, killing more than five million people. As Jared Diamond describes it, "syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495, its pustules often covered the body from the head to the knees, caused flesh to fall from people's faces, and led to death within a few months," rendering it far more fatal than it is today. Diamond concludes,"[By 1546, the disease had evolved into the disease with the symptoms so well known to us today."
Prior to the invention of modern medicines, sexually transmitted diseases were generally incurable, and treatment was limited to treating the symptoms of the disease. The first voluntary hospital for venereal diseases was founded in 1746 at London Lock Hospital. Treatment was not always voluntary: in the second half of the 19th century, the Contagious Diseases Act was used to arrest suspected prostitutes. In 1924, a number states concluded the Brussels Agreement, whereby states agreed to provide free or low-cost medical treatment at ports for merchant seamen with venereal diseases.
The first effective treatment for a sexually transmitted disease was salvarsan, a treatment for syphilis. With the discovery of antibiotics, a large number of sexually transmitted diseases became easily curable, and this, combined with effective public health campaigns against STDs, led to a public perception during the 1960s and 1970s that they have ceased to be a serious medical threat.
During this period, the importance of contact tracing in treating STIs was recognized. By tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, STI clinics could be very effective at suppressing infections in the general population.
In the 1980s, first genital herpes and then AIDS emerged into the public consciousness as sexually transmitted diseases that could not be cured by modern medicine. AIDS in particular has a long asymptomatic period—during which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others—followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States in about 1969 likely through a single infected immigrant from Haiti. Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.

Eugene Monroe

Eugene Christopher Monroe (born April 18, 1987) is an American football offensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. He was selected eighth overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at Virginia.
High school career.
Monroe played at Plainfield High School in Plainfield, New Jersey, where he was teammates with Donald Jones. A two-time first-team all-state lineman, Monroe went the final 25 games of his career without allowing a quarterback sack. After his senior season, Monroe participated in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, and was named a SuperPrep All-American, a Parade All-American, and All-USA by USA Today.
Regarded as a five-star recruit by "Rivals.com", Monroe was ranked first among the top offensive tackle prospects in 2005. “has everything: great footwork, balance, excels as both a run and pass blocker and is able to dominate in both the run and pass game. The perfect left tackle for some lucky college,” said Tom Lemming, "ESPN" recruiting analyst. Monroe chose Virginia over offers from Florida State, Miami (FL), Nebraska, and Oklahoma, among others.
College career.
As a true freshman at Virginia, Monroe played played in every game and saw action at left tackle, as back-up to D'Brickashaw Ferguson, and right guard. In his sophomore year, he played in 12 games and started six games, splitting starting duties at left tackle with Zak Stair. As a junior in 2007, Monroe was honorable mention All-ACC selection after starting 11 games at left tackle, missing two games due to knee injury. He did not allowed a sack during the regular season and had 20 knockdown blocks during the regular season, according to Virginia coaches.
In 2008 Monroe was a Unanimous All-Atlantic Coast Conference selection and was voted the ACC's most outstanding blocker. He started all twelve games at left offensive tackle and registered a school season-record 105 knockdowns, according to the coaching staff and had blocking consistency grade of 88.42%.
Professional career.
2009 NFL Draft.
Monroe was widely believed to be one of the top two offensive tackles available in the Draft (alongside Jason Smith). Particularly praised for his pass blocking ability, Monroe drew comparisons to Walter Jones. He was selected eighth overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars, a pick that was declared a "steal" by "Sports Illustrated's" Tony Pauline. Monroe was the third offensive lineman from Virginia selected in the top 15 of an NFL draft in four years, following D'Brickashaw Ferguson and Branden Albert.
Jacksonville Jaguars.
In an effort to rebuild their offensive line, the Jaguars selected Monroe and Eben Britton with their first two picks. Monroe was expected to compete with veteran free-agent acquisition Tra Thomas for the start at left tackle. On August 14, 2009 the Jaguars agreed to a five-year deal with Monroe.
In the 2012 season, Monroe started all 16 games at left tackle for the team.
Baltimore Ravens.
On October 1st, 2013, the Jacksonville Jaguars traded Monroe to the Baltimore Ravens in exchange for Baltimore's fourth- and fifth-round draft selections in the 2014 NFL Draft. His uniform number changed from 75 to 60 out of respect to Hall of Famer and former offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden.

Michael D. Johnson (born February 7, 1987 in Selma, Alabama) is a professional American football defensive end for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League. He was drafted in the 3rd round (70th overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft by the Bengals. He played college football at Georgia Tech. He originally played linebacker until the 2011 season.
Early years.
Johnson played at Dallas County High School where he was a tight end. He caught 42 passes for 650 yards and six touchdowns as a senior while making 92 tackles and 14 sacks. He had 25 receptions for 300 yards and three touchdowns as a junior. He was also an outstanding basketball player, who averaged 16 points and 10 rebounds as a junior.
College career.
As a senior at Georgia Tech, Johnson, in 2008, ended the regular season with Recorded 46 tackles (28 solos) as he led the team and finished third in the conference with nine sacks and 17.5 stops for losses and two forced fumbles. He was voted as an AFCA coaches First-team All-American with the likes of Brian Orakpo and Terrance Cody. He also garnered first team All-ACC honors as well as numerous other accolades. 
In 2007 Johnson was played in 13 games and started one. He had 21 tackle (11 solo) and six went for losses. He had four sacks and forced three fumbles and recovered one. He also blocked two kicks. The previous season, 2006, he played in and started all 12 games and had 34 tackles (25 solo) and six were for a loss. He recorded five sacks and forced three fumbles and broke up two passes. In 2005, as a true freshman, he played in 11 games and had 5 solo tackles and one assisted for a total of six tackles, one going for a loss. He also recorded one sack and forced one fumble.
Professional career.
Cincinnati Bengals.
Johnson was not selected in the 1st round of the 2009 NFL Draft where many analysts predicted he would go, instead falling into the 3rd round and being picked up by the Bengals. During an interview, Johnson was mentioned by head coach Marvin Lewis as maybe being "one of the best pass rushers he has ever worked with." Before the 2010 season, the Bengals announced that Johnson would be moved to outside linebacker.
In 2012, Johnson accumulated 52 tackles, 35 solo, and 11.5 sacks. He also had one interception and one force fumble.
The Bengals placed their non-exclusive franchise tag on Johnson on March 1, 2013.

Flag of convenience (business)

In business and commerce, the term flag of convenience is the use of a place, jurisdiction, state or country as a nominal 
(in name only) "home base" for one's operations or charter, even though either no or virtually no operations or business are conducted there. It is also used where the organization operates in one place even though nearly all of its customers are from somewhere else. It is a type of jurisdiction shopping.
There are several reasons for doing this.
Corporation requirements.
The most common use of a flag of convenience is a U.S. corporation being chartered as a domestic corporation in Nevada or Delaware because of favorable corporate governance rules. The reason for this sort of a choice is that, in general, in the United States, a corporation which operates in more than one state (or country) has a particular state where it is incorporated, to which it is a domestic corporation. In all other states where it operates and has filed papers to be allowed to operate, it is a foreign corporation, and the requirements for corporate governance in the case of a lawsuit do not use the law where the corporation is sued, but instead, the law where the corporation is a domestic corporation.
For example, because of the provisions on "piercing the corporate veil" are corporate governance matters, if a corporation is chartered in California, for example, (which has much more creditor friendly provisions permitting this) is sued anywhere, California law applies, but a corporation chartered in Nevada, which operates only in California, is sued in a California court, the California court would use Nevada law in determining what the requirements permitting this, and in this issue Nevada law applies (which is much more supportive of the corporation's interest), even if the corporation only operates in California and has never had any other contact with Nevada and is simply chartered there as a flag of convenience.
Legal restrictions on operations.
Use of a different base of operations than one normally operates within can often be done because of legal restrictions on operations in one area which are avoided by changing the nominal base of operations.

Ruby Summers

Ruby Summers is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe first appearing in the one-shot "X-Factor: Layla Miller".
Fictional character biography.
Ruby is the daughter of Scott Summers and Emma Frost from the dystopian alternate future Earth-1191.
Meeting Layla Miller.
Ruby has been living in the ruins of Atlantic City with her father, Scott Summers for decades. When Layla Miller and a man named Dwayne show up one day looking for the now aged Cyclops. Ruby attacks them and after finding out who Layla Miller is, brings her to her father, who has been waiting to see Layla for decades. After a conversation with Cyclops, Layla convinces Ruby to meet up with a new mutant named Linqon. Together they start the Summers Rebellion.
Years later.
Years after the start of the rebellion, Ruby rescues the, now aged, Layla and Jamie Madrox, whom Layla had just brought into the future from the past, from a sentinel attack. She is not pleased to find out Layla disobeyed her in bringing Madrox to the future. She later brings Scott and Layla to an old, broken down hotel where an old, fragile Doctor Doom currently resides. They question him about time travel when they are attacked by sentinels, only to be saved by Trevor Fitzroy.
She has also become very close with Layla, developing a very sisterly relationship.
Ruby is seen next when an aged Doctor Doom brings Cortex to their time, however reprogrammed, and forces the Madrox dupe to attack the mutants. Although initially at a disadvantage, as Doom has taken control Cyclops due to his cyborg nature, she manages to defeat Doom, Cortex, and Cyclops. Doom escapes and Ruby swears to kill him. 
While Madrox battles Cortex, Ruby asks Layla to revive Fitzroy who was killed during Cortex's initial assault. Although Layla does not think that it is a good idea she complies since Ruby persuades her that they may take control of their own destiny.
Powers and abilities.
Ruby has the power to emit force beams from her eyes, like her father, but hers are black and take 13 seconds to regenerate. She also has the ability to transform her body into organic ruby similar to her mother's diamond form. This ruby form halts the aging process and allows her to survive without sustenance, but due to fear that she might "age nearly seventy years in seconds" if she reverts, she has remained in this form for decades.

Fort Mansfield

Fort Mansfield was a coastal artillery installation located at the end of Napatree Point, a long barrier beach in the village of Watch Hill in Westerly, Rhode Island.
History.
Fort Mansfield and similar forts stretching from Galveston to Maine can be traced back to a joint Army-Navy Board created in 1883 known as the Gun Foundry Board. Its report a year later warned of the defenseless condition of the USA's coasts and recommended a system of fortifications to protect harbors and coastal cities from invasion. In 1885 this Board was replaced by what has become known as the Endicott Board which in 1886 issued formal recommendations for a major coastal defense network. Fort Mansfield was one of numerous coastal artillery installations constructed to guard the eastern entrance to Long Island Sound as part of the coastal defense network for New York City. It was named in honor of Joseph K. Mansfield (1803–1862) who had served as Chief Engineer Of The Army during the Mexican War and was eventually promoted to Inspector General Of The Army.
Construction.
In 1898 the United States government purchased on Napatree Point, a long, narrow spit of land jutting out from Watch Hill. The fort was located on a bend in the spit beyond which was called Sandy Point. Construction of the fort began the following year. When the fort was first manned in 1901 it was considered a sub-post of Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut. But when the fort was fully manned in 1902 its status changed to an independent battery. The fort’s main armaments consisted of two Crozier disappearing guns plus several rapid-fire cannon and were divided among three batteries: Wooster, Crawford, and Connell.
Fatal flaw.
War games held in 1907 proved the fort had a fatal flaw. Any attacking vessel could approach Fort Mansfield from a “dead angle” along the Rhode Island coast which its long-range 8 inch cannon, did not cover. The installation could be bombarded with impunity and depending on where an invading party landed, it could assault the fort opposed by nothing better than small-arms fire. A report on the war games stated "... I believe I could capture Ft. Mansfield with a fleet of coal barges, equipped with 6-inch rapid fire guns".
Because of this fatal design flaw, the fort was removed from the list of active coastal artillery posts in 1909. By 1911 only 18 men were left to man the post. That dropped to six men in 1916 and that small contingent remained until 1926 when the government placed the land up for sale. With one developer proposing nearby land on Sandy Point to be divided up into some 674 plots, the land was purchased by a private syndicate eager to prevent the land from being used for “cheap little houses” that might affect the exclusive character of Watch Hill. The sale was finalized in 1928.
Demolition.
All the government buildings were demolished during the winter of 1928–29 leaving the three concrete gun emplacements behind. Batteries Wooster and Crawford, while overgrown, survive to this day but Battery Connell has succumbed to sea erosion which has pushed the beach back some since the fort was built. What remains of Connell can sometimes be seen at low tide.
Cleanup.
In August 2009, a small group of young adults interested in historical preservation began a cleanup project on Fort Mansfield. Finding roots to be the major source of cracks and deterioration, foliage was cut back. The fort's decay has slowed because of the lack of the roots' pressure against the structure.
While this project proved beneficial in alleviating some of the stresses upon the fort, efforts from the community must occur to maintain the integrity of the constructions.In 2011, the Watch Hill Fire Department placed railings along the top edges of the main building to prevent people from enjoying and exploring the fort. They also placed steel covers blocking the steps to prevent tourists from accessing the lower level of the site.

In the early Middle Ages, Czerwien/Czermno was one of the largest Slavic gords of this part of Europe. Its history dates back to the 5th/6th century, and Czermno probably was main center of the so-called “Czerwien/Cherven Towns”. Czermno/Czerwien was first mentioned in 981, when Vladimir the Great captured it from the Poles. Czerwien remained part of Kievan Rus' until the Mongol invasion of Europe, when it was probably ransacked and destroyed. 
The location of the historic gord in what is today the village of Czerwien was confirmed by archaeologists, who worked here in 1952, 1976-79 and 1997. Total area of the gord was probably 100 hectares, divided into center, suburbs, settlements and three cemeteries. It was spread along both banks of the Huczew river, with a wooden bridge joining the two parts of the village. Czerwien was protected by ramparts and moats, there also were piers for boats. According to archaeologists, in the early Middle Ages it was as large as main centers of early Polish statehood, Poznan and Gniezno.
In April 2011 two hoards of silver jewellery were found by archaeologists during the excavation of the early medieval castle and associated settlement at Czermno. The hoards, which were situated 20 metres apart, comprised about forty items of jewellery, including earrings, finger rings, armlets, bracelets, and temple pendants. One of the hoards was found in an earthenware pot, and the other hoard was probably originally placed in a cloth or leather bag which has since decayed. The jewellery dates to the 13th century, and it is thought that the hoards may have been buried in response to the Mongol invasion of Poland in 1240.

1964 Australian Touring Car Championship

The 1964 Australian Touring Car Championship was a CAMS sanctioned national motor racing title for drivers of Appendix J Touring Cars and Group E Series Production Touring Cars. The championship was contested over a single race staged at the Lakeside circuit in Queensland, Australia, on 26 July 1964. The race was won by Ian Geoghegan, the first of his five Australian Touring Car Championship titles. Geoghegan drove a Ford Cortina in what was the first Australian championship victory for a Ford driver and the first time the Jaguars had been defeated for the title.
Race.
For the first time the race was held at a circuit within easy reach of a major city. Lakeside's proximity to Brisbane ensured a large crowd as for the first time the race appeared wide open with many fancied runners. The Jaguars had faded, although Bob Jane's Mark II was certainly a potential front runner, the rise of the Ford Cortina in either its GT specification or the Lotus tuned version, of which only Jim McKeown's was ready in time for the race. For the first time too Holden was a front runner with the S4 versions of the EH Holden. In the lead up to the race Ian Geoghegan rolled and destroyed his Cortina and a factory test car was driven up from Melbourne to get Geoghegan back in the race.
Brian Muir lead from the start but lost the lead to Jim McKeown in the early running. Muir was then passed by Jane who then moved into the lead when McKeown had a brief off and dropped behind Muir to third. Later McKeown clipped the abandon Warren Weldon Holden and hit the barriers, promoting Norm Beechey into third, a position he lost to Ian Geogehegan just passed half-distance. Jane struck clutch problems and dropped down the order putting Muir back into the lead. Beechey climed into second, not only was an Australian car leading the ATCC for the first but was second as well. With 13 laps to go though Muir pitted to replace a worn out tyre. Geoghegan pushed Beechey hard and with seven laps to go took the lead and won. Behind Beechey, Jane limped home for second ahead of the Minis of Brian Foley and Peter Manton with local Glynn Scott home for sixth position.

Street dogs in Bangkok

It is estimated that there are over 120,000 Free-ranging dogs in Bangkok, Thailand. The management of ""soi" dogs" has become a serious problem in the capital. 
Status.
Most of the 120,000 stray dogs in Bangkok are not aggressive, and many have been injured in traffic. However, strays occasionally attack people, and few have been vaccinated against canine diseases.
Management.
In the 1990s, more than 200 dogs were euthanized each day. In 1998, however, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals campaigned against the practice, which they argued violated Buddhist principles. The campaign generated substantial public outcry against the euthanization of dogs, and the city adopted a pro-life dog policy.
A recent regulation has forbidden the feeding of stray dogs in public places.
In September 2007, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration began a program of mandatory registration for dogs; the program was aimed to deter the abandonment of dogs, which could be traced to their owners. Requirements for such registration include the implantation of a microchip identifying the owner, rabies vaccination for dogs less than one year old, and sterilization; dog owners were required to register their pets before July 2008. Starting on July 4, 2008, dogs found unregistered may be sent to a dog kennel in the northern province of Uthai Thani and their owners may be fined up to 5,000 baht. Critics of mandatory registration have asserted that it has actually increased the number of strays, as dog owners who do not wish to pay for implementation are abandoning their pets rather than risking receiving fines.
Before prominent events, stray dogs have been rounded up and sent to shelters. This occurred before the 2003 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, when thousands of dogs were removed from the city and sent to the Livestock Development Department's animal quarantine stations in Phetchaburi and Sa Kaeo provinces. Stray dogs were again transported from the city in preparation for the king's 2006 anniversary celebration, with efforts focusing on areas near expensive hotels where royal guests stayed. These strays were sent to the kennel in Uthai Thani, where it was planned they would stay until their death.
In popular culture.
The 2006 Thai movie "Kao Niew Moo Ping" by Siwaporn Pongsuwan focused on the relationship between a runaway girl and the stray dog she befriends.

This Toronto band’s unusual sound has been described as “medieval ghost pop”, “sexy robot make-out music” and “ABBA and the B-52's meets a history of organ music”, though the band members themselves prefer “four gargoyles spewing juices from our throats”.
Pony Da Look released their first self-titled album in 2001, then followed it up with "The Forcefield Weakens" in 2003. The two releases combined attracted attention from Canadian music major players like Polaris Music Prize winner Owen Pallett (Final Fantasy), Joel Gibb (The Hidden Cameras) and Sloan.
Sloan signed Pony Da Look to their label Murderecords in 2007 and released "Shattered Dimensions" in 2008. Though artistically diverse, Pony Da Look and Sloan have been fans and friends of each other for years. Rebecca Mendoza and Sloan's Chris Murphy celebrated the birth of their son Francisco in 2007.
Bowles and Bates continue to paint and exhibit regularly. Mendoza is a modern dancer and choreographer Stockhausen is a TV producer and photographer.

Smilosuchus

Smilosuchus (meaning "chisel crocodile") is an extinct genus of leptosuchomorph phytosaurid from the Late Triassic of North America. The type species was first described in 1995 as a replacement generic name for "Leptosuchus gregorii". Because of the large rostral crest it possessed, it was considered to be distinct enough from other species of "Leptosuchus" (all of which had smaller and more restricted crests) to be within its own genus. Some studies seem to suggest that "Smilosuchus" is congeneric with "Leptosuchus", as the enlarged crest could have been independently developed in "Leptosuchus". However, newer studies support the idea that "Smilosuchus" is distinct from the type species of "Leptosuchus", "Leptosuchus crosbiensis". Phylogenetic analyses suggest that "Smilosuchus" is more closely related to pseudopalatines than to "Leptosuchus" species.

Sunset Tower

Sunset Tower, previously known as The St. James's Club, The Argyle, and The Sunset Tower Hotel, is a historic building and hotel located on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. Designed in 1929 by architect Leland A. Bryant, opened in 1931, it is considered one of the finest examples of Art Deco architecture in the Los Angeles area. In its early years, it was the residence of many Hollywood celebrities, including John Wayne and Howard Hughes. After a period of decline in the early 1980s, the building was renovated and has been operated as a luxury hotel under the names The St. James's Club, The Argyle, and most recently the Sunset Tower Hotel. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
Construction and architecture.
The art deco Sunset Tower is considered one of the finest examples of the Streamline Moderne form of Art Deco architecture in Southern California. In their guide to Los Angeles architecture, David Gebhard and Robert Winter wrote that "this tower is a first class monument of the Zig Zag Moderne and as much an emblem of Hollywood as the Hollywood sign." It is situated in a commanding location on the Sunset Strip with views of the city and is decorated with plaster friezes of plants, animals, zeppelins, mythological creatures and Adam and Eve. Originally operated as a luxury apartment hotel, it was one of the first high-rise reinforced concrete buildings in California. When it was completed in August 1931 at a cost of $750,000, the "Los Angeles Times" reported: "What is described to be the tallest apartment-house in Los Angeles County, rising 15 stories or 195 feet, was completed last week at Kings Road and Sunset Boulevard by W.I. Moffett, general contractor, for E.M. Fleming, owner."
Hollywood landmark.
Marketing the building to Hollywood celebrities, an advertisement in the February 1938 issue of the Screen Actors Guild magazine read: "Faultless in Appointment-The Ultimate in Privacy . . . Hollywood's Most Distinguished Address." In 1933, the "Los Angeles Times" ran an article about the trend toward luxurious penthouse apartments in the city and noted that Sunset Tower boasted the city's highest penthouse: "It is the highest in the city and due to the location of the fifteen-story structure that supports it, its tenants live on a level with the tower of the Los Angeles City Hall. Imagine the view!" John Wayne, Howard Hughes, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Buss and novelist James Wohl lived in the penthouse at different times, and Hughes reportedly also rented some of the lower apartments for his girlfriends or mistresses. John Wayne reportedly once brought a cow up to his penthouse apartment at 3 a.m. telling his party guests who were gathering for coffee that they would have to go directly to the source if they wanted cream. Other former residents include Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Marilyn Monroe, Michael Caine, Quincy Jones, Roger Moore, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Billie Burke, Joseph Schenck, Paulette Goddard, Zasu Pitts, George Stevens, Preston Sturges, and Carol Kane.
In 1944, resident Bugsy Siegel, described by the "Los Angeles Times" as a "Hollywood sportsman", was charged with running a bookmaking operations from his apartment at Sunset Tower. Siegel called it "a bum rap," and witnesses testified that Siegel and his friends were only playing "a friendly game of gin rummy." Siegel later pleaded guilty, paid a $250 fine, and was "asked" by management to leave his apartment at Sunset Tower.
The building was also the site of a publicized "Battle of the Balcony" involving bandleader Tommy Dorsey in 1944. Dorsey became involved in a fistfight with actor Jon Hall after the actor "paid undue attention to (Dorsey's) actress-wife Pat Dane" at a party held in Dorsey's apartment. The "Los Angeles Times" reported that actor Eddie Norris "darn near got killed . . . during the celebrity-infested brawl . . . when he tried to act as peacemaker" between Dorsey and Hall, who "came out of the fracas with his classic nose almost severed from his suntanned face."
In 1947, Truman Capote wrote in a letter: " I am living in a very posh establishment, the Sunset Tower, which, or so the local gentry tell me, is where every scandal that ever happened happened." Others report that the Sunset Tower was "notorious for having the best-kept call girls in Hollywood."
The hotel has also appeared in several feature films, including "The Italian Job", "Get Shorty", "The Player" and "Strange Days."
Decline in the 1980s.
By 1982, a plan to convert the building to condominiums failed, and construction was halted abruptly with residents still living there. The building had deteriorated and was described as "like something from a war-ravaged land." At the time, resident Werner Klemperer (Col. Klink from "Hogan's Heroes") said of the building: "Welcome to Beirut West."
The St. James's Club.
The building was saved from deterioration and possible demolition when it was purchased in 1985 from architect David Lawrence Gray, FAIA by Peter de Savary who promised to "lovingly restore" the building to its former glory by spending $25 million to convert the building into the first American branch of his luxury hotel chain, the St. James's Club. David Gray's firm handled the historic restoration of this treasure and in 1988, the Los Angeles Conservancy gave the owners an award for their work in preserving the Sunset Tower. The exterior and interior Lighting Design (excluding fixtures) was completed by ex-Disney designers Shawn Barrett, Gary Bell and William Sly. The St. James's Club operated an upscale hotel for several years, popular with celebrities, including David Bowie.
Restoration and operation by Jeff Klein.
The Lancaster Group purchased the hotel from de Savary in 1992, renaming it the Argyle. In 2004, Jeff Klein purchased the hotel. Klein hired designer Paul Fortune to renovate the hotel, adding more modern amenities, and restored its original name. In 2006, Toronto's "The Globe and Mail" reviewed the renovated Sunset Tower and noted: "This isn't a place that needs to declare itself 'hip' because its grand history speaks for itself—and has been successfully carried forward to the present." London's "Daily Mail" noted: "Bill Murray and Penélope Cruz are often spotted in the restaurant, where, on most nights, you can hear 84-year-old Page Cavanaugh, who played for Sinatra and Doris Day in the 1940s, tinkle the ivories."
As part of the 2006 restoration, the Tower Bar was reconfigured to have a more turn of the century ambience. After the Tower Bar opened in 2006, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that it had become one of the trendiest in Los Angeles: "On a recent night at the intimate Tower Bar, Jennifer Aniston dines 10 feet away from Joaquin Phoenix and white-coated waiters weave between tables like players in a Broadway musical. A $155 bottle of Pinot Noir is uncorked here, chilled oysters delivered there and a bow given every now and then." "The New York Times" also reported on the transformation of the hotel: "The striped silk-and-walnut Tower Bar restaurant is already a retro clubhouse for the mature Hollywood set (think Brian Grazer and Barbara Walters), complete with $13 martinis and the octogenarian former Sinatra pianist Page Cavanaugh tickling the ivories. On a Friday night in mid-December, Anjelica Huston and Courtney Love swanned by to dine with a 30-something crowd far more sophisticated than the teenyboppers roaming Sunset Boulevard outside." Other celebrities visiting the Tower Bar include Sean Penn, Victoria Beckham, Tom Cruise and Jennifer Lopez. Dmitri Dmitrov, a 60-year-old Macedonian immigrant with Rudolph Valentino hair, is the Tower Bar's maître d’hôtel. Dmitrov is a sphinxlike figure who knows everything and says nothing. In the six years since Klein, following a suggestion from the designer Tom Ford, rescued Dmitrov from a fading career at drearily elegant places like a local Russian restaurant that featured a harpist, ice swans and a caviar menu, he has become a Hollywood institution. In February 2007, the "New York Post" reported that the hotel's front desk manager was nearly fired when Britney Spears tried to book three rooms. Owner Jeff Klein was reportedly overheard yelling at the manager, "If that piece of trailer trash so much as enters my driveway, you are fired. She can't come here with all my chic guests, she'll ruin the place." Also in 2007, Sean "Diddy" Combs showed up with an entourage to attend a Golden Globes party, and was told his name was not on the list. When Combs was reported to have become "verbally abusive," owner Jeff Klein personally asked Combs to leave. When Klein said he would call the police if Combs did not leave, the "New York Post" reported that Combs was heard shouting, "Just try it - I'll spend the rest of my life hunting you down!" In February 2009, Vanity Fair hosted its Oscar party at the Sunset Tower.
Historic designation.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Greg Hardy

Gregory McKarl Hardy (born July 28, 1988), nicknamed The Kraken, is an American football defensive end for the Carolina Panthers. He was drafted by the Panthers in the sixth round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football at Ole Miss.
Early years.
Hardy formerly played with offensive lineman Michael Oher at both Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Tennessee and Ole Miss. Hardy was considered a three-star prospect by "Rivals.com" and ranked 30th among weakside defensive end prospects in 2006.
College career.
Hardy was considered one of the best pass rushers eligible for the 2009 NFL Draft but he elected to return to Ole Miss for a senior season. He underwent surgery on a broken bone in his right foot during the off-season but was ready for the 2009 season.
Hardy had 38.5 career tackles for loss and 26.5 sacks, which included a best in the SEC 10.0 sacks in 2007.
Professional career.
Pre-draft.
In April 2009 "Sports Illustrated", Hardy was named the top prospect for the 2010 NFL Draft. However injuries, poor production, and an unimpressive combine, caused his draft stock to fall significantly.
Carolina Panthers.
Hardy was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the sixth round (175th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. He was signed to a contract on June 17, 2010. Hardy managed to record a blocked punt for a safety as well as force a fumble and record 4 tackles in his rookie debut.
Although Hardy had played in 15 games his rookie year, he had started none. He did however, finish the year with 30 tackles, 3 sacks, two forced fumbles, and the aforementioned safety.
Hardy recorded 11 sacks in a stellar 2012 campaign in spite of sustaining a broken thumb in September.
On November 9, 2012, Hardy was fined $15,750 for a roughing the passer penalty against Robert Griffin III versus the Washington Redskins in Week 9.
On June 11, 2013, Hardy spoke to reporters during a summer minicamp claiming his goal for sacks in the 2013 season to be 50. Regarding such a lofty number, more than twice the current record, Hardy stated, "Why shoot low, right? If I'm going to shoot at it, I'm going to shoot at it with a 50 caliber. I'm going to shoot at a little bird with a 50-caliber bullet. That's the goal for this year, 50 sacks, that's where I'm at. That's the goal, 50. You heard it first.". He ended up recording a team-record 15 sacks, earning his first trip to the 2014 Pro Bowl and being named a second-team All Pro by the Associated Press.
Set to become a free agent during the 2014 offseason, it was announced on February 28, 2014, that the Panthers had placed the franchise tag on Hardy, allowing him to return to the field for them during the 2014 season.

K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 Final

K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 Final was a martial arts event held by the K-1 on Saturday December 6, 2008 at the Yokohama Arena in Yokohama, Japan. It was the 16th K-1 World GP Final, the culmination of a year full of regional elimination tournaments. All fights followed the classic 8-man tournament format and were conducted under K-1 rules; three rounds of three minutes each, with a possible tiebreaker. The qualification for the top eight fighters in this event was held at K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 in Seoul Final 16.
Final 8 match ups.
The drawing of the final 8 match ups took place in the ring right after the final 8 had been determined in Seoul, Korea. A random draw assigned the selection order and the fighters one by one made their way to a stage. First, Ruslan Karaev chose the third fight, next up was Bonjasky who opted for the fourth fight. Zimmerman went to the second bout. Saki, selecting fourth, matched himself up with Karaev. Selecting next, Teixeira decided Zimmerman in the second bout. Aerts eschewed a match-up with Bonjasky, instead of still-empty first bout. LeBanner, with the option of Aerts or Bonjasky, put himself in against the latter. Hari therefore ended up with Aerts.

William de Croÿ (bishop)

William de Croÿ (known as Guillaume de Croÿ in French and Guillermo de Croÿ in Spanish); (1497 – January 7, 1521) was Archbishop of Toledo from 1517–1521. He was born in the Burgundian Netherlands and died in Worms, Germany.
Appointment as Archbishop.
William de Croÿ was the nephew of the powerful William de Croÿ, one of the most important advisers to Charles of Ghent, the future Holy Roman Emperor. Thanks to this connection, he was granted the lucrative bishopric of Soria. As an absentee bishop, this entailed no duties or work, and merely gave him an income source. Pope Leo X appointed William the additional office of cardinal on April 1, 1517.
On November 8, 1517, the Archbishop of Toledo, Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, died. The Archbishopric of Toledo was the richest and most powerful in Spain, and very prestigious. The main other claimant to succeed Cisneros was Alonso de Aragón, Archbishop of Saragossa and King Ferdinand II of Aragon's illegitimate son and young King Charles's half-uncle. However, the seventeen-year-old Charles's biggest influence was still William de Croÿ, who maneuvered his twenty-year-old nephew into the Archbishopric. The decision was made on November 9, though complications meant he was only appointed in the first week of 1518. Most notably, Queen Isabella I of Castile's will had specifically prohibited the granting of ecclesiastical offices to foreigners. Charles solved this problem by issuing a writ of naturalization on November 14 to William decreeing him a Castilian. Additionally, Pope Leo X had granted an indult on October 12 freeing William from any current or future residency requirement to an office. It had been originally meant to legitimize his holding of the Bishopric of Soria, and was now used to justify the Archbishopric of Toledo.
This appointment was immensely scandalous in Castile. Cisneros had been universally respected, and William was an unknown foreign boy. The representatives at the Cortes of Valladolid in 1518 presented petitions protesting the act. The petitions demanded that no further foreigners be granted naturalization writs and that Croÿ reside in his see. Charles agreed, but ignored the petition anyway; Croÿ never lived in Toledo. The outrage at this act of patronage would be one of the many sparks of the Revolt of the Comuneros in 1520.
Death.
William was injured by a fall from his horse while in Emperor Charles V's train on January 6, 1521. The Emperor's court had been at Worms, Germany at the time, and William died the next day. The news was concealed for a time while the royal authorities considered what to do, and as a result the death was only announced January 11. This date was incorrectly used as his death date when initially announced.
William de Croÿ's death provoked a clamor back in Spain, which his death was known by January 25. Antonio Osorio de Acuña, bishop of Zamora and comunero rebel, dropped his campaign in the North of Castile around Palencia to head south to Toledo and attempt to succeed William as Archbishop. The comuneros were eventually defeated, though, and Alonso III Fonseca became the new Archbishop of Toledo in 1523.
Little pity was shown Croÿ in Castile; a contemporary account from Alonso de Santa Cruz, royal historian of King Philip II, said that "it was a just judgment of God that neither did Croy enjoy the archbishopric nor was the Marquis restored." (Diego López Pacheco, the Marquis of Villena, had been one of the very few nobles to support William's appointment, likely in an attempt to gain the elder de Croÿ's favor, but failed to get his lost lands back.)

Squirrel King

Squirrel King is a platform/action video game produced, without license from Sega, by the Taiwanese developer Gamtec for the Mega Drive. Gamtec is also responsible for the development of a number of other games, including many for the Gamate handheld system.
It appears to be loosely based upon Capcom's "Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers" video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, sharing its gameplay mechanics, although it is not licensed by Disney. As in the aforementioned game, the main character must throw crates at the enemies in order to defeat them. Sometimes crates have helpful things like extra fireballs, extra lives, and health boosts. Other times, they have "power-downs" that reduce the player's health. Despite some animation issues, this game is considered to be of professional quality. Players are given a limited amount of lives and continues to beat the game with; it takes half as many games to gain an extra life in two-player mode as opposed to the single-player mode. This video game is divided into seven acts; with a elephant denomined Barnett as the final boss of the game.
This game was eventually used as the basis for the unofficial Mega Drive "Super Mario World" game. Two of the levels in this game have their background music based on that of the Super NES video game "Donkey Kong Country".
A hack version of Super Mario World, also known as Super Mario Bros. (both titles appear in-game) also exists, which is a copy of "Squirrel King" and uses ripped graphics from "Super Mario Bros.". Newly drawn sprites to make the "Squirrel King" characters look more appropriate are used as well. Despite its overhauled appearance, the gameplay was unchanged, so, unlike the original "Super Mario Bros." game it resembles, Mario and Luigi are unable to stomp on enemies and must instead throw crates at them.

Guardian Industries

Guardian Industries is a privately held industrial manufacturer of glass, automotive and building products based in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
The company manufactures float glass, fabricated glass products, fiberglass insulation and building materials for commercial, residential and automotive applications.
The company employs more than 18,000 people and has present activities in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
History.
Guardian Industries was founded in 1932 as Guardian Glass Company. The company was originally established as a small windshield fabricator. In 1957, the same year Guardian filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, William Davidson became president of Guardian, 10 years after he graduated from the University of Michigan in 1947. After three years in 1960, Guardian came out of bankruptcy. In 1968, the company officially changed its name to Guardian Industries Corp. and under William Davidson’s leadership; they went public with the initial trade valued at $17 a share. The following year Guardian began trading on the American Stock Exchange.
In 1970, Guardian started producing flat glass with the newly invented float glass process. They opened their first production line in Carleton, Michigan and today the company counts 28 float glass lines and 13 glass fabrication plants around the world. In 1973 it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
From on 1980, Guardian started to diversify its activities and they started the production of fiberglass insulation. The European market entry took place in 1981 when the company opened their production line in Bascharage, Luxembourg. Further plants came up in Germany, Spain, England, Hungary and Poland.
The company went back to a privately held company in 1985 after 17 years as a public company.
In the 1990’s, Guardian could note down an upswing both in the sectors construction materials and automotive products due to several takeovers and acquisitions: Automotive Moulding Company Warren, Michigan; Lab. Radio from Valencia, Spain; Builder Marts of America (BMA) and Cameron Ashley Building Products (which is now the Guardian Building Products Distribution) in 2000.
In 1995, corporate headquarters moved from Novi to their present location in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
The takeover of Siegel-Robert Automotive in 2008 led to the formation of SRG Global.
Business divisions.
Guardian’s activities can be divided into three main sections:
(I) Glass products: Those are the registered trademarks belonging to the float glass section:
(II) Automotive products : Guardian serves the automotive market with Automotive Glass and SRG Global,a Guardian company and Tier 1 supplier of grilles and exterior/interior trim. SRG Global is one of the world's largest manufacturers of chrome plated plastic parts, used by virtually every car manufacturer in the world. Guardian also supplies windshields and replacement glass for cars and RVs through its Automotive Aftermarket.
(III) Building products : Guardian Building Products (GBP) is one of the largest manufacturers of fiberglass insulation and is among the largest building material distribution networks in North America. It has a growing presence in the global building materials industry, too. GBP claims to have more than 30,000 customers in the residential and light commercial construction industries.
Those are the present (2012) leader persons:

Battle of Lanzerath Ridge

The World War II Battle of Lanzerath Ridge was fought on December 16, 1944, the first day of the Battle of the Bulge, near the town of Lanzerath, Belgium. It was fought between 18 men belonging to an American reconnaissance platoon, four U.S. Forward Artillery Observers, and a battalion of about 500 German paratroopers. During a day-long confrontation, the American reconnaissance men inflicted dozens of casualties on the Germans and bottled up the advance along a key route for the 1st SS Panzer Division, which had been selected to spearhead the advance of the entire German 6th Panzer Army.
The Germans finally flanked the American forces at dusk, capturing them. Only one American, a forward artillery observer, was killed, while 14 were wounded: German casualties totaled 92. The Germans paused, believing the woods were filled with more Americans and tanks. Only when "SS-Standartenführer" Joachim Peiper and his Panzer tanks arrived at midnight, twelve hours behind schedule, did the Germans learn the woods were empty.
Due to lost communications with Battalion and then Regimental headquarters, and the unit's subsequent capture, its disposition and success at delaying the advance of the 6th Panzer Army that day was unknown to the U.S. commanders. Lt. Lyle Bouck considered the wounding of most of his men and the capture of his entire unit a failure. When the war ended five months later, the platoon's men, who were split between two prisoner-of-war camps, just wanted to get home. It was only after the war that Bouck learned that, because his platoon prevented the lead German infantry elements from advancing, the schedule for the armored units' advance was also pushed back by about 20 hours. On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying, a Congressional hearing, and letter-writing by Bouck, every member of the unit were finally recognized for their valor that day, making the platoon the most decorated American unit of World War II.
Background.
Prior to the Battle of the Bulge, the U.S. Army was engaged in a campaign to attack the Roer River dams before invading the rest of Germany. The 99th Infantry Division was supporting the 2nd Infantry Division in their attack on the German West Wall at Wahlerscheid. During two days of hard fighting, the U.S. Army had finally managed to slip through the heavily fortified lines and penetrate the German defenses. The Americans were expecting a counterattack in the area, but their intelligence completely failed to detect the German's movement of hundreds of armored vehicles and tens of thousands of infantry into the region. Much of the region was relatively quiet, lending the area the title of "Ghost Front."
During early December 1944, the American's defensive line in the Ardennes had a gap south of Losheimergraben. General Leonard T. Gerow, in command of V Corps, recognized this area as a possible avenue of attack by the Germans. This area, which lay between V Corps and Troy H. Middleton's VIII Corps, was undefended; just patrolled by jeep. The patrols in the northern part of the area were conducted by the 99th Infantry Division's 394th Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon, whereas those in the south were conducted by the 18th Cavalry Squadron, 14th Cavalry Group, which was attached to the 106th Infantry Division.
In the border area between Germany and Belgium, there was only one road network that could support a military advance: It was through the area known as the Losheim Gap, a long, narrow valley at the western foot of the Schnee Eifel. This was the key route through which the German Sixth and Fifth Panzer Armies planned to advance.
On December 11, General Walter M. Robertson, commander of the battle-hardened 2nd Infantry Division, was ordered to attack and seize the Roer River dams. In case he had to pull back, he chose Elsenborn Ridge as his defensive line. General Walter E. Lauer, commanding the 99th Infantry Division, was charged with building up the defenses around Elsenborn Ridge. Lauer knew his front was very long and very thinly manned; he gave instructions to his division's soldiers to dig in and build cover for their foxholes.
Prelude.
Inexperienced American units.
The platoon consisted of two nine-man reconnaissance squads and a seven-man headquarters section, which was attached to the 394th regimental S2 section. As the platoon was not intended, nor trained, for combat, they were told to avoid direct engagement with the Germans. Nonetheless, they took part in several missions behind enemy lines,even as far as Losheim behind the front line, to capture enemy soldiers for intelligence. Bouck and several of his men were among the first group in their regiment to be recognized with the Combat Infantry Badge. Most often their patrols consisted of creeping through snow-clogged defiles obscured by fog in an attempt to fix enemy positions.
On December 10, the reconnaissance platoon was ordered by Major Kriz to a new position, about south east of Hünningen, near Lanzerath, Belgium, a village of about 15 homes. The village lay at a critical road junction in the northern part of the Losheim Gap. The 18-man unit was charged by Kriz with plugging a gap in the front line between the 106th Division to the south and the 99th Division to the north. The only reserve was the 394th Infantry Regiment's 3rd Battalion, which was at Bucholz Station. Behind them lay roads that would give the enemy rapid access to the Army's rear and allow them to easily flank the thinly placed 99th Division.
American defensive preparations.
The I&R platoon took over positions on a ridge top immediately northeast of Lanzerath that were formerly occupied by part of the 2nd Infantry Division. They were ordered to improve their foxhole positions and maintain contact with Task Force X, made up of four towed three-inch guns from the 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion, which was attached to the 14th Cavalry Group, 106th Infantry Division of VIII Corps. They were reinforced by the 22 men of the 820th's 2nd Recon Platoon, commanded by Lieutenant John Arculeer, who were mounted on an armored half-track and two jeeps. Members of the Second Platoon took up positions within two homes inside the village of Lanzerath about to the southeast. Together, the two units comprised the foremost units in their sector of the American forces facing the Siegfried Line.
The Americans were attacking through the Siegfried Line at Walerscheid about to the north, and a localized counter-attack was expected. Lt. Bouck followed procedure and ordered his men to build fortifications with interlocking fields of fire. Taking advantage of the foxholes left by the previous unit, they dug them deeper so that two or three men could stand in them and fire from the concealed edges. They covered each hole with to pine logs. Their hilltop location was just inside the edge of a forest and overlooked a pasture bisected by a high barbed wire fence parallel to their location. Their position covered about along a shallow ridge line, about above the road and northwest of the village. Their foxholes were situated in a shallow curve along the ridge line in a northeast direction, almost to a fork in the road at their left flank. Snow fell, covering their dug-in fortifications inside the woods, leaving them virtually invisible from the road below.
Once an hour, in an attempt to fill the gap in their sector, they ran a jeep patrol up and down the line to stay in contact with units on their right and left flank and to detect any enemy movement. They hoped they would be relieved soon: "We weren't trained to occupy a defensive position in the front lines. We were trained to patrol and get information about the enemy," Bouck said in an interview 60 years later. On the night of December 16, they heard the clanking of armor and the sound of vehicles in the distance; Bouck ordered his men to remain awake. The temperature ranged from to the low during the day.
German positions.
Many of the German units were recent conscripts with very little experience. Sergeant Vinz Kuhlbach's platoon was typical. Most of his soldiers had little combat experience and even less training. The German units had been formed by conscripting teenage boys and men over 50, men previously rejected as physically unfit for service, wounded soldiers newly released from hospitals, and men transferred from the "jobless" personnel of the shrinking Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe. The German 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division, which had previously acquired a superb combat reputation, had been virtually destroyed during the Normandy Invasion in the Falaise pocket. It had been resurrected by using replacements from the 22nd, 51st, and 53rd Luftwaffe Field Regiments. The German units were usually organized around small cadres of seasoned veterans. Although they carried the new Schmeisser machine pistol and were equipped with rifle grenades, few had ever fired them in combat. The German recruits were told the American soldiers they faced would not have the nerve to stand and fight. Their officers said the Americans were "a gum-chewing, undisciplined half-breed with no stomach for real war."
To preserve the available armor, the infantry of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division, had been ordered to lead the attack through Lanzerath and clear the village before advancing towards Bullingen. The German commanders estimated they would face a full division of U.S. troops.
The German's initial position was east of the German-Belgium border and the Siegfried Line near Losheim. SS Oberstgruppenführer Sepp Dietrich's plan was for the Sixth Panzer to advance northwest through Losheimergraben and Bucholz Station and then drive through Honsfield, Büllingen, and a group of villages named Trois-Ponts, to connect to Belgian Route Nationale N-23, and cross the River Meuse. It was then another to Antwerp. Unfortunately for the Germans, during their retreat earlier that autumn they had destroyed the Losheim-Losheimergraben road-bridge over the railway, which prevented their use of this route. While German infantry were able to use the Lanzerath-Losheimergraben road to advance on Losheimergraben, the railroad overpass could not bear the weight of the German armor. On the first day of the offensive, the German engineers were slow to repair the Losheim-Losheimergraben road, thus forcing Peiper's vehicles to take the road through Bucholz Station.
Once the infantry captured Lanzerath, Sepp Dietrich’s Sixth Panzer Army led by Kampfgruppe SS Standartenführer Joachim Peiper's 1st SS Panzer Division would proceed without delay. The infantry would then secure the right flank of the attack route near Losheimergraben. Despite the losses that had brought the Allies to the border of their homeland, German morale was surprisingly strong. The men knew the Allies were demanding an unconditional surrender. They were now fighting for the fatherland, defending the soil of their beloved country, not just fighting for Hitler.
Dietrich knew the plan had flaws. The Germans had captured the same terrain during the summer of 1940 in three days. Now they were being asked to do it in winter in five days. The plan counted on bad weather to keep the Allied planes grounded. Dietrich only had one-quarter the fuel they needed; their plan counted on capturing Allied fuel depots and keeping to an ambitious timetable. Dietrich's assigned route (or Rollbahn) included narrow roads – in many places single-tracks – which would force units of the Kampfgruppe to tail each other, creating a column of infantry and armor up to long. The roads would prevent the attackers from concentrating their forces in the blitzkrieg fashion which had served them so well in the past. The main roads designated for their use had many hairpin turns and traversed steep hillsides that would delay his already slow-moving towed artillery and bridging trains. Dietrich knew that a determined fight at one of these critical choke points by even a token U.S. force could seriously impede his schedule. When Hitler's operations officer Generaloberst Alfred Jodl gave him his orders, Dietrich yelled, "I'm a general, not a bloody undertaker!"
Battle.
German barrage.
Many shells exploded in the trees, sending shards of steel and wood into the ground, but the men were protected by their reinforced foxholes. The German guns cut deep holes the size of trucks in the pasture.
German advance.
German infantry began to advance near Losheim before the artillery barrage lifted, preparing to cross the front line as soon as it ended. They marched under the glow of massive searchlights, bouncing light off the clouds. The armor was located farther back, near Blankenheim, Germany. At 8:00, as the sun rose, the American platoon heard explosions and guns around Buchholz Station and Losheimergraben to the east and north where the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 394th Infantry Division was located. The 55 soldiers of U.S. 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 14th Cavalry Group was initially ordered south to help protect Manderfeld, but shortly afterwards were redirected to join the active battle near Buchholz Station. They withdrew from the village and left without contacting the I&R platoon. This left the platoon as the only unit in the sector and without armor support.
Bouck sent James, Slape and Creger to set up an observation post in a house on the eastern side of the village that had been abandoned by Task Force X. Accompanying them, he spotted in the dawn light a long column of what appeared to be about 500 German troops headed toward them from the east. Their distinctive helmet style told Bouck they were paratroopers, among the best soldiers Germany could field. None of his training or experience prepared him for this situation, outnumbered as he was by perhaps 20 to 1. Bouck and James scrambled back to the ridge top and the rest of their unit. The platoon's telephone land line to 1st Battalion headquarters in Losheimergraben was knocked out, but their SCR-300 radio still worked. Bouck reached Regimental headquarters at Hünningen on the radio and requested permission to withdraw and engage in a delaying action. He was told to "remain in position and reinforcements from the 3rd Battalion will come to support you."
In town, Creger watched as a forward element of the German infantry advanced, with weapons slung, into Lanzerath. They obviously did not expect to encounter any Americans. Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more direct route. As he returned to the American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.
On the eastern side of the road, Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola attempted to rejoin their platoon, but found the way blocked by German soldiers who threatened to flank them. They decided to head for Losheimergraben and seek reinforcements. They crossed a deep railroad cut and once on the far side encountered soldiers from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division. Trying to outflank the 1st Battalion, 394th Infantry Regiment in Losheimergraben, they spotted the three men. After a brief firefight, Robinson and McGeehee were wounded and all three were captured.
Germans entered the home that Creger and Slape were using as an observation post. Slape climbed into the attic, while Creger only had time to hide behind a door. He pulled the pin on a grenade as the door knob jammed into his ribs. Bullets from the I&R platoon struck the building, and the Germans suddenly left. Creger and Slape exited by the back door and ducked into a nearby cowshed. They crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield. Picking their way forward, they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans. Opening fire, they killed them. Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and Milosovich across the road and sprinted towards them, drawing German fire. They made it back to their ridge-top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters. He requested artillery support, but when he reported the German column advancing on his position, the voice on the other end of the radio told him "he must be seeing things". Bouck told them he had 20-20 vision and demanded artillery fire on the road in front of his unit.
U.S. artillery unavailable.
But the platoon's position at the southern end of the 99th Division's sector was not only outside their own regimental boundary, it was outside their Division's boundary and V Corps boundary. The division prioritized artillery fire for targets within its boundary. Bouck waited in vain for the sound of incoming artillery. He called Regimental Headquarters again, asking for directions. He was told to "hold at all costs," which essentially meant until dead or captured. Bouck knew that if his platoon gave way, the 99th Division's right flank, already thin and undermanned, could be in grave danger.
Radio operator James Fort attempted to contact headquarters on the SCR-284 radio mounted on a jeep by the command post and found that German martial music jammed the channel. He then used a side-channel and Morse code, hoping the Germans weren't listening, to send a status report to regimental headquarters.
German attack.
As the German forces moved through Lanzerath and in front of their positions, Bouck and his men allowed lead members of the unit to pass, hoping to surprise the Germans. They were preparing to fire on three men who they believed were the Regiment's officers when a girl from the village emerged from one of the homes. Talking to the officers, she pointed in their general direction. An officer yelled a command, and the paratroopers jumped for ditches on either side of the road. The Americans thought she had given their position away and fired on the Germans, wounding several. (In October 2006, more than 50 years later, a writer found the now adult woman, still living in the village. She told him she did not know the Americans were still in the area, and was pointing out the direction the Tank Destroyer unit had departed, towards Bucholz Station.)
Four members of a Forward Observation Team from Battery C, 371st Field Artillery had been in the village when the Tank Destroyer unit withdrew. Lieutenant Warren Springer and the other three men, Sergeant Peter Gacki, T/4 Willard Wibben, and T/5 Billy Queen joined Bouck's unit on the ridge where they could continue to observe the enemy movement. Bouck distributed them among the foxholes to help reload magazines and reinforce their position.
The German infantry deployed and about two platoons of the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, then attacked the Americans head-on, bunched together in the open and charging straight up the hill, directly at the platoon's hidden and fortified positions. The Americans were surprised at the inexperienced tactics. For the Americans, it was like "shooting clay ducks in California at an amusement park." Several attackers were killed trying to climb over the -high barbed wire fence that bisected the field, often shot at close range with a single shot to the heart or head. Lt. Springer used his jeep-mounted SCR-610 radio to call in coordinates for artillery fire. A few shells landed near the road outside Lanzerath, but they did not hinder the German attack. His jeep was then struck by machine gun fire or mortar shrapnel and his radio was destroyed.
Slape and Milosevich fired continually, as fast as they could reload. Slape thought the Germans were mad to attack in such a suicidal manner, straight across the open field. He later recalled that it was one of the "most beautiful fields of fire" he had ever seen. After only about 30 seconds, the firing stopped. Nearly all of the attacking Germans had been killed or wounded. McConnell, shot in the shoulder, was the only American casualty.
During a second attack made around 11:00 am, Milosevich fired the .50 caliber jeep-mounted machine gun until enemy fire drove him back into his foxhole. In both the first and second attack that morning no German soldier got past the fence in the middle of the field. Bodies were piled around it. German medics waved a white flag late in the morning and indicated they wanted to remove the wounded, which the American defenders allowed. The Americans again suffered only one wounded on the second attack, when Pvt. Kalil was struck in the face by a rifle grenade that failed to explode.
The Germans mounted a third attack late in the afternoon, around 3:00. Several times German soldiers attempted to penetrate the American lines. The Americans left their foxholes and in close combat fired on the attackers to push them back down the hill. At one point PFC Milsovech spotted a medic working on and talking to a soldier he felt certain was already dead. As mortar fire on his position got more accurate, Milsovech noticed a pistol on the supposed medic's belt, and decided he must be calling in fire on their position. He shot and killed him. Bouck contacted Regimental Headquarters once more, seeking reinforcements. At 3:50, Fort sent the unit's last update to Regimental headquarters in Hünningen. He reported they were still receiving some artillery fire but were holding their position against an estimated enemy strength of about 75, who were attempting to advance from Lanzerath towards the railroad to the northwest.
As dusk approached and their ammunition ran dangerously low, Bouck feared they could be flanked at any time. He planned to pull his men back just before dusk, when they would have enough light to escape through the woods. Bouck ordered his men to remove the distributor caps from their Jeeps and to prepare to evacuate to the rear. He dispatched Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston through the woods to locate Major Kriz at Regimental HQ and seek instructions or reinforcements.
Bouck tried to contact Regimental headquarters on the SCR-300 radio for instructions. A sniper shot the radio as Bouck held it to his ear. The sniper also hit the SCR-284 radio mounted in the Jeep behind Bouck, eliminating any possibility of calling for reinforcements or instructions.
The German troops were reluctant to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk. Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, and he thought he would be shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger; it was empty. Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck said it was not his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village.
Conclusion.
During their dawn to dusk fight, the 15 remaining men of the I&R platoon plus the four men of the 371st Artillery Forward Observation Team repeatedly engaged elements of the 1st Battalion, 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division of about 500 men. The Germans reported 16 killed, 63 wounded, and 13 missing in action. Other reports say the Americans inflicted between 60 and five hundred casualties on the Germans. Only one American, forward artillery observer Billy Queen, was killed; in Bouck's platoon, 14 out of 18 men were wounded. The small American force had seriously disrupted the schedule of the entire 6th Panzer Army's drive for Antwerp along the entire northern edge of the offensive. After virtually no sleep during the preceding night and a full day of almost non-stop combat, with only a few rounds of ammunition remaining, flanked by a superior enemy force, the platoon and artillery observers were captured.
Aftermath.
German armor advance.
Kampfgruppe Peiper, the lead element of the Sixth Panzer Army's spearhead, 1st SS Panzer Division, consisted of 4,800 men and 600 vehicles. On December 16, it started as much as to the east in Tondorf, Germany, and was unable to advance at its scheduled rate because of road congestion. The road from Scheid to Losheim was one solid traffic jam, in part due to two blown railroad overpasses blocking access to Losheimergraben, but also due to American resistance. Peiper's lead units did not reach Losheim until 7:30 pm, when he was ordered to swing west and join up with the 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division, which had finally cleared the route through Lanzerath. Peiper was furious about the delay. En route to Lanzerath, Peiper's unit lost five tanks and five other armored vehicles to American mines and anti-tank weapons. Kampfgruppe Peiper finally reached Lanzerath near midnight.
Lt. Bouck, held in Café Scholzen, turned 21 years old at midnight on December 17. At midnight, he watched as a senior German officer (who he later identified as Peiper) attempted to obtain accurate information about the U.S. Army's strength in the area. Peiper was told by Obersturmbannführer i.G. von Hoffman, a former Luftwaffe general staff officer from Berlin and commanding officer of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division, that his men had run into stiff resistance. He reported that the woods and road ahead were packed with American troops and tanks. He had bedded his troops down for the night and planned to probe the forest for Americans at first light. Their expectations of further resistance was all based on the stiff defense offered by Bouck's force of just 18 men.
Peiper asked the Battalion commander and a Hauptmann (captain) in the same unit about the American resistance. Both said they had not personally seen the Americans, but that the woods were heavily fortified. Peiper learned that no patrols had been conducted into the woods and no one had personally reconnoitered the area. Disgusted, Peiper demanded that von Hoffman give him a battalion of paratroops to accompany his tanks. At 4:30 on December 17, more than 16 hours behind schedule, the 1st SS Panzer Division rolled out of Lanzareth and headed east for Bucholz Station. The entire timetable of their advance on the River Meuse and Antwerp had been seriously slowed, allowing the Americans precious hours to move in reinforcements.
Peiper's lead units entered Bucholz Station without resistance at 5:00 am. They found only two rifle companies from the 3rd Battalion, 394th Infantry Regiment had been left to defend it; these were quickly captured, except for a headquarters company radio operator. Hidden in a cellar, he called in reports to division headquarters until he was finally captured. Driving east, the Germans entered Honsfield at 6:00 am where his column merged in the dark with an American column. In Honsfield, they encountered one of the 99th Division's rest centers, which was clogged with still sleeping, confused American troops. They killed many, destroyed a number of American armored units and vehicles, and took several dozen prisoners, who were later executed by elements of his force.
Based on the noise to the northeast, Peiper decided that the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend was encountering more resistance than expected. Unable to contact his division headquarters, and with his vehicles low on fuel, Peiper decided to switch his planned route to the south through Büllingen, where he believed an American fuel depot existed. His units entered the town at 8:00 am and easily captured of fuel for his vehicles. He was apparently unaware he had nearly taken the town and unknowingly bypassed an opportunity to flank and trap the entire 2nd and 99th Divisions. Peiper turned south to detour around Hünningen, interested only in hurrying west as quickly as he could. The unit gained notoriety when on this route they encountered a lightly armored American convoy and apparently murdered 84 U.S. prisoners of war in what became known as the Malmedy massacre.
The German advance never recovered from its initial delay, and Kampfgruppe Peiper only got as far as Stoumont, where the remaining vehicles ran out of fuel and came under heavy attack from American artillery and tanks. Having advanced less than half-way to the River Meuse, they were forced to abandon more than a hundred vehicles in the town, including six Tiger II tanks. The soldiers were left to find their own way back to the east on foot. Having started the offensive with about 5,800 men, 60 tanks (some Tigers), 3 flak tanks, 75 half-tracks, 14 20mm Flak Wagons, 27 75mm assault guns, plus 105 and 150mm SP Howitzers, Hitler's prized Kampfgruppe was reduced to 800 S.S. troopers creeping through the brush at night, trying to get back to their own line.
The task of defeating the 99th Division was the objective of 12th SS Panzer Division reinforced by additional Panzergrenadier and Volksgenadier divisions. On December 17, German engineers repaired one of the road bridges over the railroad along the Losheim-Losheimergraben road and the 12th Division's armor began advancing towards the key road junction at Losheimergraben and the twin villages of Rocherath and Krinkelt. However, in more than ten days of intense battle, they were unable to dislodge the Americans from Elsenborn Ridge, where elements of the V Corps of the First U.S. Army prevented the German forces from reaching the road network to their west.
Due to the determined resistance of the 99th Division, which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops, along with the 2nd and 23rd Divisions, the northern shoulder of the Battle of the Bulge was a sticking point for the entire offensive operation. Had the Americans given way, the German advance would have overrun the vast supply depots around Leige and Spa and possibly have changed the outcome of the Battle of Bulge.
Prisoners of war.
The I&R platoon members who were able to walk were sent to Germany. James and Kalil, who were seriously wounded, were loaded onto trucks and eventually transported to hospitals in Frankfurt and Hanover. McConnell, also wounded, ended up like James in Stalag XI-B near Bad Fallingbostel, the most primitive POW camp in Germany where about 6,000 Soviet prisoners had died of typhus during 1941. After two days of walking through the cold, Bouck and the remainder of his platoon were loaded into a boxcar in the village of Junkerath. They spent 11 days traveling deep into Germany, as the POW camps were overflowing with prisoners. Their unmarked trains were prime targets for Allied aircraft, who attacked Bouck's train on December 21, killing and wounding several POWs. The prisoners were allowed off only once, and were given only some bread and water during the entire trip.
Bouck and his men were finally imprisoned in Stalag XIII-D in Nuremberg and later in Stalag XIII-C in Hammelberg, where the non-commissioned and enlisted men were split, with the officers sent to Oflag XIII-B. Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston were captured before they reached Allied lines, and they later joined Bouck and the rest of the platoon in the prison. The men barely survived, most suffering from the advanced effects of malnutrition. When Task Force Baum from Patton's 4th Armored Division attempted to liberate the camp, Bouck pretended to be a field grade officer and accompanied the task force as it attempted to return to the front lines. However, almost the entire task force was captured or killed, and Bouck was returned to prison for the remainder of the war. When he was freed, he was too weak to file a combat report, and he did not think his men had accomplished that much. "We were in those foxholes and ... what we did was to defend ourselves and try to live through it."
Unit recognition.
All who were wounded and captured recovered to return home after the war. In 1965, the U.S. Army published a multi-volume history of World War II, including one on "The Ardennes: The Battle of the Bulge." Author Hugh M. Cole only briefly mentioned Bouck's platoon, which upset former platoon member William James (who had changed his name from Tsakanikas). James contacted Bouck and encouraged him to get his men proper recognition.
Bouck contacted his former division commander, Maj. Gen. Walter E. Lauer, who nominated Bouck for a Silver Star. In June 1966, a Silver Star arrived in Bouck's mailbox, but no other platoon member was recognized. Bouck was shortly afterward interviewed by John S. D. Eisenhower for his book "The Bitter Woods", which described the actions of the unit in detail. Columnist Jack Anderson unsuccessfully campaigned for William James (Tsakanikas) to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Congressional hearings on the men's action resulted in a recommendation to the Secretary of Defense that Bill James be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force concurred, but the Marine Corp responded that James failed to show sufficient "intrepidity". The hearings also resulted in Public Law 96-145, which waived the time limitation exclusively for members of the platoon. It was signed by President Jimmy Carter on December 14, 1979.
On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying and letter-writing by Bouck, the men of the unit were finally decorated. Fourteen of the 18 were present at the ceremony hosted by Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh. Every man was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. Four received the Distinguished Service Cross, five the Silver Star, and nine got the Bronze Star with V device for their 10-hour struggle against a 500-man strong German battalion.
Platoon members and the citations they received were:
Lieutenant Warren Springer and his three-man artillery observation unit — Sergeant Peter Gacki, T/4 Willard Wibben, and T/5 Billy Queen - also joined the men in battle. Queen was killed in action before the remainder were captured. All four were awarded the DSC for their valor at Lanzerath.
In 2004, the book "The Longest Winter" was published, documenting the defensive actions of the platoon. Bouck cooperated with the author, Alex Kershaw, but imposed one condition, "I told him that other authors never wrote about the other men in the platoon, just me. I said I wouldn't talk to him unless he promised that he'd also write about the other men."
On May 12, 2005, veterans of the 99th Infantry Division and local citizens of Lanzerath, Belgium, dedicated a monument composed of a small brass plaque alongside a bench and a United States flag to commemorate the fight on the grassy hill overlooking the village.

Adampol, Lublin Voivodeship

Adampol is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Wyryki, within Włodawa County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.
During World War II, Adampol was the site of an "Arbeitslager", a slave-labor subcamp of the Sobibor extermination camp nearby. Jewish partisans rescued several Jewish girls from a farm at Adampol, where they were being kept hostage 'for the pleasure of German officers'. Most of the Jews of Wlodawa and the surrounding towns were transported daily from the Wlodawa Ghetto to the camp at Adampol, until October 1942, when almost all of them, some 8,000 people, were shot or deported to Sobibor.
Survivors, including Jack (Yankele) Glinzman and his uncles, Jack (Yankel), Israel (Srulka) and Joseph (Yuscha) Glincman and cousins Bob (Bollek) Becker, Pomeranc and others fled into the forest on the Belorussian border and joined up with the Parczew partisans. 
There is a memorial to the Jews who were murdered in Adampol at the entrance to the estate where the Nazis were headquartered, paid for by the Pomeranc and Blaichman families.

Conceptual proliferation

In Buddhism, conceptual proliferation(, ) refers to conceptualization of the world through the use of ever-expanding language and concepts. The translation of papañca as conceptual proliferation was first made by Katukurunde Nanananda Thera in his research monograph Concept and Reality. It is a useful concept, not only in Buddhism but in many other fields (see below).
It is intended to elucidate reality, although it has the unexpected result of blotting out or reducing direct nonverbal sensory perception. In part, this is due to each person's limitation of how many things they can pay attention to at the same time. A person who can only attend to two things at once, may be able to receive a direct sensory picture of the tree while at the same time saying "The apple tree in the garden," but the picture will not be as complete.
Accident Prevention
For example, California lists distraction (conceptual proliferation is perhaps the biggest) as one of the 3 major causes of accidents.
The term is mentioned in a variety of "suttas" in the Pali canon, such as the Madhupindika Sutta (MN 18), and is mentioned in Mahayana Buddhism as well. When referencing the concepts derived from this process, such concepts are referred to in Pali as "papañca-saññā-sankhā".
Nippapañca.
"Nippapañca" is the diametrical opposition of "papañca".

Naszczowice is one of the oldest villages of the region. Its name probably comes from a man named Nosacz, and in the oldest preserved documents from 1233, it was spelled Nossaczouicy. Jan Dlugosz provides two spellings of the name: Nossaczowycze and Noszaczowycze, while in the 1794 Austrian census, it was spelled Naszacowice and Naschatowitz Colonia.
According to archaeologists, a large fortified gord existed here in the 8th century. It was located in the spot of an earlier Lusatian culture settlement, and in the early years of the Kingdom of Poland, the gord was an important center of local administration and the Dunajec river trade route to the Kingdom of Hungary. The gord lost its importance after a great fire, and was replaced by Podegrodzie.

Podegrodzie is a village in Nowy Sącz County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Podegrodzie. It lies approximately south-west of Nowy Sącz and south-east of the regional capital Kraków. The village has a population of 1,700.
Podegrodzie is the seat of one of the oldest Roman Catholic parishes in historic Lesser Poland. It was probably established here in 1014 by Boleslaw Chroby, due to the fact that in the early Middle Ages, two fortified gord existed in this area: Zamczysko and Grobla. Furthermore, Podegrodzie is one of the centers of an ethnic group Lachy Sadeckie. Here, the Museum of Lachy Sadeckie is located. 
The village owes its name to the location. Podegrodzie in loose translation means "a settlement under the gord", as it was located at the two castellan residencies, the gords of Grobla and Zamczysko. It was first mentioned in documents from the late 13th century, and Jan Dlugosz wrote its name in two ways: Podgrodzye and Podgrodze. In 1538 it was spelled Podegrodze, and in 1581 - Podgrodzie.
In the late 10th century, when southern Lesser Poland became part of the Kingdom of Poland, the seat of the Castellan was a gord at Naszczowice. After it had burned, the castellans moved their residence to the Zamczysko gord, which also burned after some time. Next residence was the gord of Grobla, located on a hill several hundred meters southwards. The village of Podegrodzie was established between the two gords. In 1241, Podegrodzie and Grobla were destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Poland. As a result, the town of Stary Sacz was founded in 1278, replacing Grobla as main administrative center of the region.

James Humphreys (lawyer)

James Humphreys (c. 1768–1830) was a Welsh barrister, law reformer and legal writer. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and called to the bar in 1800 by Lincoln's Inn. Politically he was a liberal. His major publication in the field of law reform was "Observations on the Actual State of the English Laws of Real Property, with the outlines of a Code" (1826).
Life.
A native of Montgomeryshire, Humphreys was articled to a solicitor named Yeomans at Worcester. He then entered Lincoln's Inn in November 1789, read with Charles Butler, was called to the bar (25 June 1800), and obtained a good practice as a conveyancer.
In politics Humphreys was a Whig and liberal, and was friendly with Charles James Fox, Henry Clifford, Sir James Mackintosh, and Sir Francis Burdett. He went to John Horne Tooke's parties at Wimbledon, and delivered a course of lectures on law at the newly founded University of London. 
Humphreys died on 29 November 1830, in Upper Woburn Place, London.
Works.
Humphreys's major work, "Observations on the Actual State of the English Laws of Real Property, with the outlines of a Code" (London, 1826, 2nd edit. 1827), gave him a reputation as a legal reformer. Fox is said to have suggested the work, but it came from association with Charles Butler and with the school of analytical jurists led by Jeremy Bentham and John Austin. Bentham wrote a flattering notice in "The Westminster Review". Changes that Humphreys proposed were opposed at the time, but most were later adopted in the 19th century: shortened forms of conveyance, registration of title, abolition of copyhold tenure, increase in the number of judges, improvement of procedure, the alteration of the law of descents, and others. Edward Burtenshaw Sugden, John James Park, and others published criticisms of Humphreys's proposals, but his scheme was praised by James Kent in America. The need for radical change in the land laws was recognised by the appointment in 1827 of the real property commission. Humphreys also wrote "Suggestions respecting the Stamp Duties affecting Real and Personal Property", published posthumously in 1830, and other pamphlets.

James Lysaght Finegan

James Lysaght Finegan or Finigan (died 8 September 1900) was an Irish barrister, soldier, merchant and politician. 
He was educated by the Congregation of Christian Brothers and described as an "Anti-clericalist", and with his family engaged in the tea trade, while supporting the Nationalist cause. In 1867 a nationalist called Michael Breslin was forced to leave Ireland, and only avoided arrest thanks to documents given to him by Finegan certifying him as a tea trader.
Finegan later served in the French Foreign Legion during the Franco-Prussian War, leaving in 1871 at the conclusion of the war. In the 1879 by-election in Ennis he was proposed as an alternative candidate to that of the Home Rule League by Charles Stewart Parnell; he won by only six votes, out of 247 electors. His service in parliament was brief; he resigned in 1882.

The privileges included the Dolina Lejowa, Polana Bialy Potok, Hawrylowka, Roztoki, Polynica, the forests of Furtaska, Kryta and Krzyskowka. During Poland's Partition Period (123 years) the region remained under Austrian jurisdiction and the town and its privileges were sold in Vienna to land investors. Under the communists' jurisdiction, in 1976 the governmental decree illegally expropriated Dolina Lejowa. The forests of Furtaska, Kryta, Krzyskowka and Bialy Potok, Hwrylowka and Roztoki valley did survive and remained as part of the 7 Villagaes Commonwealth with the Head Office in Witow. Presently the village counts about 640 residences. A significant number of them emigrated to USA and Canada. They became strong contributing members of new North American communities and also active members of the Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America (Zwiazek Podhalan) in Chicago and Toronto.

St. Matthias' Abbey

St. Matthias' Abbey is a Benedictine monastery in Trier, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.
The abbey church, a Romanesque basilica, is a renowned place of pilgrimage because of the tomb of Saint Matthias the Apostle, after whom the abbey is named, located here since the 12th century, and the only burial of an apostle in Germany and north of the Alps. The abbey was originally named after Saint Eucharius, first Bishop of Trier, whose tomb is in the crypt. The church has been given the status of a basilica minor.
History.
First foundation.
Monks have lived in the present St. Matthias' Abbey since late antiquity. The monastery adopted the Rule of St. Benedict in about 977.
Since the 10th century the bones of the founders of the Archbishopric of Trier, bishops Eucharius and Valerius, have been preserved here.
The bones of the Apostle Matthias were supposedly sent to Trier on the authority of the Empress Helena, mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine I, but the relics were only discovered in 1127 during demolition work on the predecessor of the present church buildings, since which time the abbey has been a major centre of pilgrimage.
Efforts to reform in the wake of the Council of Basle, under Johannes Rode, the Carthusian prior appointed by the bishop, led to spiritual and economic renewal, to the extent that St. Matthias' became an example for other monasteries. The attempt to found a congregation round it came to nothing, however, and St. Matthias' in due course joined the Bursfelde Congregation in 1458.
The abbey passed through the Reformation almost unscathed, but it was badly affected by wars and looting, and also by conflicts with various bishops or abbots. The last abbot was relieved of his office as early as 1783, years before the actual dissolution of the abbey, and management from then on lay in the hands of the prior.
When the troubles of the French Revolution spilled over onto German territory, the abbey buildings were requisitioned by the French army, and monks were obliged to leave the abbey, at first with the intention that this was to be a temporary absence, living from 1794 to 1802 in the parish house ("Mattheiser Pfarrhaus"). In 1802 however the abbey was nationalised and secularised. When the premises were sold off, the local businessman Christoph Philipp Nell acquired the bulk of the main building complex and used it with little alteration for his residence, thus preserving it from the demolition and gross alterations for industrial purposes that befell many other monastic buildings at this period.
Apart from the main abbey complex there remain, particularly in villages along the Moselle, many farmhouses and estate buildings which formed the abbey's economic basis before secularisation. They are often called "Mattheiser Hof" ("Matthias' farm") or other names making reference to the abbey. An especially large farm of this sort was the "Roscheider Hof" near the village of Merzlich (now Konz-Karthaus), now the "Volkskunde- und Freilichtmuseum Roscheider Hof" ("Local History and Open-air Museum, Roscheider Hof"), where the original building is preserved as one of the exhibits.
Second foundation.
After several attempts to revive the monastery in the 19th century, monks from Seckau Abbey, part of the Beuron Congregation, moved into the "Mattheiser Pfarrhaus" after World War I. On 22 October 1922 the main building complex was rededicated as a Benedictine abbey and resettled. The new community joined the Beuron Congregation.
In 1941 the National Socialist government suspended the monastery and the monks moved to Maria Laach Abbey. After their return in 1945 there was dissension over the care of the parish of St. Matthias, which was now independent of the Benedictine order, for whom parochial duties with the secure income they provided represented a staple economic resource. It was recommended that the monastic community should move to Tholey Abbey in the Saarland, a move which split the community between those who were willing to go to Tholey, and those who preferred to stay in Trier. Those monks who remained in St. Matthias' became independent of any congregation, and remained so until 1981, when they joined the Congregation of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary ("Congregatio Annuntiationis BMV").
Since 1991 the abbey has had a close link with Huysburg Priory in Saxony-Anhalt, refounded in 1972. In September 2004 the two monasteries joined as one community.
The community devotes itself to the cure of souls - in 2007 10,000 Roman Catholics belonged to the parish of St. Matthias - as well as hospital and pilgrimage duties. The community also receives guests and leads ecumenical discussions. Individual brothers may also pursue secular occupations, such as judge, town planner or teacher.
From 1981 to 2005 Dom Ansgar Schmidt led the community as its abbot until his election as President-Abbot of the Congregation. Ignatius Maaß was elected his successor, and nominated Matthias Vogt as his new prior; the benediction took place on 22 October 2005. 
As of 2007 19 monks lived in the abbey.
Buildings and art.
Basilica.
St. Matthias' Basilica, which was dedicated on 13 January 1148, combines four functions. It is the parish church of the parish of the same name; the monastic church of the Benedictine community; a pilgrimage church centred on the tomb of Saint Matthias the Apostle; and the burial church of the first bishops of Trier, Eucharius und Valerius. The church building, like all such, is in a constant state of tension between on the one hand the preservation and care of the structure, and on the other the need to meet current demands.
The basilica has therefore been thoroughly transformed during a long-drawn-out exercise in cleaning up and alteration. The crypt has been extended by a further two bays and provided with new means of access. The place of the veneration of Saint Matthias the Apostle, as well as the altar space, have been adapted to modern requirements. Stable choir stalls have been built for the monks' choir. A lift has been installed for easier access to all levels. On 10 December 2007 during a solemn pontifical office with Bishop Reinhard Marx the bones of the Apostle Matthias in their shrine were translated to their final location in the crypt, with the solemn dedication of the altar planned for 24 February 2008. The conclusion of the building works with an overhaul of the electrics and a final paint job is not presently possible due to financial constraints.
Reliquary of the Cross.
In the Chapel of the Cross ("Kreuzkapelle") in the north side-tower of the basilica is kept the reliquary of the cross, or "staurotheca". It dates from the 13th century and is made of worked gold; in the centre is a golden cross set with precious stones, which is said to contain pieces of the True Cross. The Chapel of the Cross is accessible on guided tours.
Abbots (incomplete list).
After the refoundation:
The community split in 1949: one part resettled in Tholey with Abbot Petrus Borne; the remainder in Trier belonged to no congregation and was directly subordinate to the Abbot-Primate of the Benedictine Order.
Relations to other communities.
Delegations from St. Matthias' visit both Dinklage and Mirfield every year, who in turn send every year a delegation to St. Matthias'.
