Airedale-Wharfedale Senior Cricket League

The Airedale and Wharfedale Senior Cricket League is an amateur cricket competition in North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. It is made up of 36 local teams spread over three divisions. The league runs 3 distinct competitions (1st, 2nd and 3rd XIs) as well as a cup competition for each.
Organisation & Structure.
36 clubs are divided into three divisions. The league is run by the management committee and other than the general rules of cricket, rule amendments are suggested and voted upon by all the member clubs. Two clubs are relegated from divisions 1 and 2 each year (those finishing in the bottom two places), with two clubs being promoted from the division below. The two clubs finishing, bottom and second to bottom respectively, of the third division must state its case for re-election each year.
The 36 clubs are spread over a relatively wide geographical area in North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. The location of the clubs broadly follows the valleys and landscapes of the River Aire and the River Wharfe.
The league is known for being well organised as competently run by the management committee and the standard of cricket is considered to be one of the best of the 'second tier' of Yorkshire league cricket, with the Bradford Cricket League, the Yorkshire ECB County Premier League and the South Yorkshire Cricket league (and perhaps the North Yorkshire/South Durham Cricket League) occupying the first tier. 
The 'A&WSCL' is remarkable for its diversity. There are small village style teams (Steeton, Bardsey, Illingworth, Upper Wharfedale, Beckwithshaw) as well as established multi-sport clubs (Adel, Pool, Guiseley, Collingham) within the competition, often competing on similar terms. In recent years the league has progressed in terms of quality and preparation, some argue as a result of the rise of Kirkstall Educational Cricket Club as one of the regular title contenders. 
The diversity extends to the physical grounds themselves, some being rural and picturesque whilst other are more charming inner city facilities.
Players.
A number have clubs have been the home to test or international cricketers at a time during their career, with many more having housed players that have represented counties at junior or second XI level. Due to their overlapping geography, players frequently transfer between the A&WSCL clubs and the clubs in the Bradford Cricket League.
The League Competition.
League fixtures take place between late April and early September each year. Each side plays every other team in that division home and away. Each fixture comprises a 50 over game with no fielding restrictions. Points are allotted from a total of 6. 
There are no bonus points on offer. If during the course of a season sides are tied on points in the league competition the side with the most outright wins is the winner.

Plutonium borides

Several plutonium borides can be formed by direct combination of plutonium and boron powders in an inert atmosphere at reduced pressure.
PuB was reported to form at 1200 °C with a range of 40–70% boron. It supposedly has a Pu-B bond length of 2.46 Å and the NaCl structure, as do TiB, ZrB and HfB. The existence of PuB was contested later based on several arguments.
PuB2 is formed at 800 °C and has a similar structure to most other metal diborides.
At 1200 °C with 70–85% boron, mixtures of PuB4 and PuB6 are formed, with more of the latter as the temperature increases; PuB4 has the tetragonal structure (same as UB4), and PuB6 has cubic structure, same as all hexaborides (CaB6, LaB6 etc.).
The most remarkable plutonium boride is arguably PuB100. Its existence demonstrates the importance of contamination in boride research because as little as 1% of an impurity is capable of changing its crystal structure.

Frederik V Schenck van Toutenburg

Frederik Schenck van Toutenburg (Vollenhove, ca. 1503 – Utrecht, 25 August 1580) was the first archbishop of Utrecht (previously only a bishopric).
Biography.
The son of Georg Schenck van Toutenburg, he graduated in law at the Reichskammergericht in Speyer. After being made a priest, he became archdeacon of the Pieterskerk in Bishopric of Utrecht and priest at the Sint-Plechelmusbasiliek in Oldenzaal. He spent his time writing tracts on church law until he was promoted to the Dutch episcopate in 1559 by Philip II, who named him as the very first Archbishop of Utrecht (which was then confirmed in 1561 by Pope Pius IV). Until that time, the Bishopric of Utrecht reported to the Archbishop of Cologne. By agreement between Philip II and Rome in the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, the low countries (at that time a loose set of Seventeen Provinces) received its own archbishoprics, which besides Utrecht were Mechelen and Cambrai. This was an attempt to give the various parts of the low countries some self-government as a way of fending off the Protestant Reformation. These measures were not very successful, and Scheck van Toutenburg's archbishopric saw the Catholic reaction against the Council of Trent in the northern Netherlands. Governor Margaret of Parma forced him to lead support for the decrees of the Council of Trent and led him to call a provincial synod in 1565. The clergy and canons were fiercely opposed to the new disciplinary measures and tried to frustrate their introduction, but Schenck van Toutenburg used his power to break the opposition and to give leadership in the fight against Protestantism.
Protestant Reformation.
Schenck van Toutenburg was unable to unite the Catholics under his archbishopric. Under his tenure, many good Catholic Utrecht burgers became secret Protestants. As the Dutch Revolt began and William the Silent, stadtholder since 1559, fled, Maximilien de Hénin-Liétard was named the official stadtholder of the Netherlands in 1567 with his base in Utrecht at Vredenburg (castle). Like Schenck van Toutenburg, he met with insurrection with those under his command. After unsuccessfully preventing the Capture of Brielle in April–June 1572, he convened a meeting of the States General in The Hague in July 1572, but many representatives convened a new meeting in Dordrecht later that month, in which they pledged allegiance to William the Silent (or now, William of Orange). As the country turned to Protestantism and the Orange sympathies grew, Hénin-Liétard was taken prisoner at the Battle on the Zuiderzee on October 11, 1573. His Spanish troops based at Vredenburg thus lost their local leader.
The nearby city of Oudewater was massacred by Spanish troops for its participation in rebellion on 7 augustus 1575. Only those who could pay ransom money escaped. This shocked many leading Utrecht burgers. Though Hénin-Liétard was released as a term of treaty in the Pacification of Ghent in 1576, he no longer had command of Vredenburg and chose the side of William of Orange. This caused a problem of loyalties among the Spanish stationed at Utrecht. The city council of Utrecht sent representatives to Archbishop Schenk van Toutenburg to borrow money to pay the Spanish mercenaries at Vredenburg who had as a result pointed their canons at the city itself. These Spanish troops still had no leader and worse, had not been paid. Schenk van Toutenburg refused to pay, and the city fathers forced the lock on his money chest to "loan" 40,000 guilders. This was the end of Utrecht's allegiance with Catholicism, as they feared a fate like Oudewater. In June 1580 the city council of Utrecht decided to ban Catholic services in Utrecht. The archbishop died later that summer on August 25.
Legacy.
He became the first and last Archbishop that Utrecht had for 237 years. The Cathedral of Utrecht was closed from June onwards, though Roman Catholics still received permission to bury their dead (including their late archbishop) in the cathedral. Schenck van Toutenburg's funeral ceremony on 30 August 1580 was the last Catholic service in Utrecht for a long while and was disturbed by Protestants, who sang their version of psalm 130 against the Catholic version ("De Profundiis").

Joachim Alva

Joachim Ignatius Sebastian Alva (21 January 1907 – 28 June 1979) was an Indian lawyer, journalist and politician from Mangalore. He was a prominent Christian figure involved in the Indian independence movement.
After Independence, Alva was appointed Sheriff of Bombay in 1949. In 1950, he entered the Provisional Parliament of India. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1952, 1957 and 1962 from North Kanara.
History.
Joachim Alva belonged to the Alva-Bhat, a Mangalorean Catholic clan from Belle in Udupi district. He was educated at Elphinstone College, Government Law College, Mumbai and Jesuit St. Xavier's College, Mumbai.
In 1928, Alva became the first Christian to be appointed as Secretary of the fifty-year old Bombay Students Brotherhood. Along with Khurshed Nariman, H.D. Raja and Soli Batliwala, he was a pioneer of the Bombay Youth League.
In 1930, Alva founded the Nationalist Christian Party with the goal of drawing the Christian community into the freedom struggle. He was expelled from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai for moving a resolution at the Catholic Students Union urging it to throw open its doors to students of other communities. In 1937, Alva presided over a large meeting of Christians at Bombay addressed by Jawaharlal Nehru. He was actively involved in organizing the "No-Tax" campaign at the Bardoli Satyagraha and appointed Dictator of the War Council.
Imprisoned twice by British Indian authorities on charges of sedition, Alva was jail companion to Vallabhbhai Patel, Jayaprakash Narayan, Morarji Desai and J. C. Kumarappa. In 1934, Mahatma Gandhi wrote a letter to Alva to inform him that he had missed him at Yerwada Jail because of his early release.
In Nasik prison, Alva wrote two books: "Men and Supermen of Hindustan" and "Indian Christians and Nationalism." Although the manuscripts of both were confiscated by prison authorities, "Men and Supermen of Hindustan" was subsequently re-drafted and published in 1943.
In 1937, Alva married Violet Hari, a Gujarati Protestant from Ahmedabad and professor of English at St. Xavier's Indian Women's University College. Violet would also go on to become active in national politics.
On August 9, 1943, the first anniversary of Quit India Day, Joachim and Violet Alva founded "FORUM", a weekly news magazine which became known for its championing of the cause of independence.
After Independence, Alva was appointed Sheriff of Bombay in 1949. In 1950, he entered the Provisional Parliament of India. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1952 and 1957 and 1962 from North Kanara. In 1952, Violet was elected to the Rajya Sabha making them the first couple to be elected to Parliament under adult franchise.
The Government of India issued a stamp commemorating the couple in November 2008.
Personal life.
Joachim and Violet Alva had two sons, Niranjan and Chittaranjan, and a daughter, Maya.
The couple were close associates of Khin Kyi, Burma's ambassador to India from 1960, widow of Burmese nationalist General Aung San and mother of Aung San Suu Kyi. The late Henry F. Grady, the first US Ambassador to India, was godfather to Maya. 
Niranjan Alva is married to Margaret Alva, née Margaret Nazareth, former General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee, former Governor of Uttarakhand and presently Governor of Rajasthan.

Mark Burke

Mark Stephen Burke (born 12 February 1969) is an English former footballer who played as a midfielder. A player skilled at retaining the ball, he enjoyed a 15 year professional career in England, the Netherlands, Japan, Romania, and Sweden.
He began his career at Aston Villa, turning professional in February 1987. He was sold on to Middlesbrough for £50,000 in December 1987, and played for Fourth Division champions Darlington on loan in October 1990. He transferred to Wolverhampton Wanderers for a £25,000 fee in March 1991, before playing on loan at Luton Town in March 1994. He signed with Port Vale in August 1994, before moving on to Fortuna Sittard the following year. He joined Omiya Ardija in 1999, before signing with TOP Oss via Rapid Bucharest and IF Brommapojkarna in 2001, helping the latter to the Division 2 Östra Svealand title.
Playing career.
Burke joined Aston Villa on schoolboy forms aged 14, and played for England Schoolboys, before signing professionally in February 1987. He made his senior debut in a 1–0 defeat to Everton on 18 April 1987, as the "Villans" were relegated out of the First Division in 1986–87. They were immediately promoted in 1987–88, but Burke managed only eight appearances for the club before joining fellow Second Division side Middlesbrough for £50,000 in December 1987.
"Boro" ended the campaign behind second placed Aston Villa on goals scored, yet they too won promotion after beating Chelsea in the promotion/relegation play-offs to claim a place in the top flight; Burke did not feature in either leg of the play-off final. They finished one place and one point behind Aston Villa in 1988–89, but this time their inability to surpass his former club cost them, as they occupied the final relegation place. "Boro" plummeted to 21st in the second tier in 1989–90, finishing just two points ahead of relegated Bournemouth. Burke was largely on the sidelines after falling out with manager Bruce Rioch, and after a spell on loan at Darlington in October 1990, he finally left Ayresome Park in search of regular football at Wolverhampton Wanderers, signing for a £25,000 fee in March 1991. This move reunited him with Graham Turner, who had been Villa manager at the time of Burke's arrival there. Darlington went on to top the Fourth Division in 1990–91, whilst Wolves finished 12th in the Second Division.
The midfielder made his Wolves debut in a 3–3 draw with Oxford United on 16 March 1991, but was again unable to hold down a regular first team spot. The club improved slightly to post an 11th place finish in 1991–92. His best season at Molineux came in 1992–93 when he managed 34 appearances, scoring 8 times – the best seasonal tally of his career, as Wolves again came 11th. He was again on the periphery for the following campaign, as his side finished 8th, three points behind Derby County in the play-offs.
After a short spell on loan at First Division rivals Luton Town in March 1994, he returned to his parent club to find Graham Taylor, another of his former managers from his Villa days, was now at the helm. Burke was unable to win a place in Taylor's plans though, and had a trial at Tottenham Hotspur, before eventually joining Port Vale in August 1994. He scored twice in 15 First Division games under manager John Rudge in 1994–95, before quitting England to explore foreign football.
His first foreign club were Fortuna Sittard in the Dutch Eredivisie, where he played under Pim Verbeek. Fortuna finished 13th in the Eredivisie in 1995–96, 11th in 1996–97, 7th in 1997–98, and 10th in 1998–99. He did not get along with new boss Bert van Marwijk, and so followed Pim Verbeek all the way to J2 League club Omiya Ardija in June 1999. He scored five goals in 20 games in 1999 and 4 goals in 31 games in 2000. Burke eventually returned to Europe after his contract expired in Japan and spent some time training with Fortuna Sittard again before signing for Rapid Bucharest on a short-term contract in March 2001, making him the first English footballer to ever play in Romania. Rapid finished fourth in Liga I in 2000–01. Burke moved on to Swedish Division 2 club IF Brommapojkarna, and helped his new club to the Östra Svealand title in 2001. He then played four games for TOP Oss of the Eerste Divisie in 2001–02.
Style of play.
He has been described as "sure of touch, calm of mind, he would lope around in seemingly lackadaisical fashion before offering a cute little pass here or a deft touch there. A man with an eye for ball retention."
After football.
In 2013 Burke released his first eBook "A different kind of soccer book", aimed at children, coaches and parents.
He is capable in several languages: English, Spanish and Dutch.

Ferussaciidae is a family of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Achatinoidea.
This family has no subfamilies. The family name Ferussaciidae is from 1883 and therefore it is more recent than the family name Cecilioididae Mörch, 1864, however the latter has been declared as a nomen oblitum because it has not been used for over 100 years. Ferussaciidae has been declared a nomen protectum.
Distribution.
The distribution of Ferussaciidae includes Africa to Europe and the Near East, tropical Americas, Hawaii and tropical Asia.
Fossil record.
"Cecilioides sommeri" is the family's oldest fossil record, dating from the Middle Paleocene of Brazil (Itaboraí Basin). 
Anatomy.
In this family, the number of haploid chromosomes lies between 26 and 30 (according to the values in this table).

Military career.
Gerhard Bielig joined the Reichsmarine as a "Seekadett" on 26 September 1934. He was promoted to "Fähnrich" (Ing.) on 1 July 1935 and to "Oberfähnrich" (Ing.) on 1 January 1937. Bielig was transferred to the U-boat service in October 1937. Now a "Leutnant" (Ing.), he was posted to "U-20" as chief engineer (German language: "Leitender Ingenieur" LI). Bielig participated on eight patrols onboard of "U-20". "Oberleutnant" (Ing.) Bielig left "U-20" in March 1940 and was assigned to "U-103" as chief engineer in July 1940. He went on five patrols with this U-boat. He left the boat as "Kapitänleutnant" (Ing.) in December 1941 only to be transferred to "U-177" in March 1942. "U-177" at the time was under command of Robert Gysae. Here he was bestowed with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 10 February 1943 after he saved the U-boat from severe depth charging. After two combat patrols he left "U-177" in October 1943 again and became an instructor at the 2. Unterseeboots-Lehr-Division.
On 16 November 1944 he married Marianne Bastian. The marriage produced two sons, Detlef born 1948 and Frank born 1949.

Shlomo Havlin (born July 21, 1942) is a Professor in the Department of Physics at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel. He served as President of the Israel Physical Society (1996–1999), Dean of Faculty of Exact Sciences (1999–2001), Chairman, Department of Physics (1984–1988).
Biography.
Professor Shlomo Havlin was born in Jerusalem, Israel (then part of The British Mandate of Palestine). He graduated from Bar-Ilan and Tel-Aviv Universities with Highest Distinction. He obtained an academic position at Bar-Ilan University in 1972 where he became a full Professor at 1984. During 1978–1979 he was a Royal Society Visiting Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, where he worked with Professors William Cochran and Roger Cowley. In 1984 he became the Chair of the Physics Department at Bar-Ilan University until 1988. During 1983–1984 and 1989–1991, Professor Havlin was a Visiting Scientist at NIH where he collaborated much with Drs. George Weiss, Ralph Nossal and other members of NIH. During 1984–1985 and 1991–1992 he was a Visiting Professor at Boston University, where he collaborated with Professor H. Eugene Stanley.
Centers and research impact.
Professor Havlin established four Centers at Bar-Ilan, the Gonda-Goldschmiedt Medical Diagnostic Research Center (1994), the Minerva Center for Mesoscopics, Fractals and Neural Networks (1998), Science Beyond 2000 – Science Education Unit (1996) and Israel Science Foundation National Center for Complex Networks (2003). He was the President of the Israel Physical Society (1996–1999) and the Dean of the Faculty of Exact Sciences at Bar-Ilan University (1999–2001). Professor Havlin had more than 100 graduate students and postdocs, and collaborated with more than 300 scientists around the globe. He published more than 600 articles and 11 books. He is currently in the editorial board of the scientific journals: Fractals,
Physica A,
New Journal of Physics, Research Letters in Physics and co-editor of Europhysics Letters.
Prizes and awards.
Professor Havlin obtained numerous prizes for his outstanding research, including the Landau Prize for Outstanding Research in Physics (1988), the Humboldt Award – Germany (1992), Prize for best scientific paper of 2000, Bar-Ilan University (2000) and Prize for best popular scientific paper, Minister of Science, Israel (2002). He also obtained the Nicholson Medal of the American Physical Society (2006), the Chaim Weizmann Prize for Exact Sciences (2009) and the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize (2010).
Professor Havlin made many important contributions to science. The following are descriptions of his main contributions in randomness and complexity.
Physical properties of disordered systems.
Disordered systems that are self-similar on certain length scales are ubiquitous and often modeled by percolation-type models. The laws that describe transport processes or chemical reactions in these systems are significantly different from those in homogeneous systems. The earlier works of Prof. Havlin, where he discovered several of these important anomalies, had an enormous impact on the development of the whole field and are summarized in the monograph “Diffusion and Reactions in Fractals and Disordered Systems” that he wrote together with his former graduate student Daniel ben-Avraham (Cambridge University Press, 2000). The book describes the anomalous physical laws discovered during 1980-2000 in fractals and disordered systems, many of them by Prof. Havlin and his collaborators. His review article (Adv. in Phys. (1987)) was cited more than 1100 times and was chosen by the journal's editors to be published again (Adv. in Phys. (2002)).
Complex networks.
In 2000, Professor Shlomo Havlin and his student Reuven Cohen, together with Prof. Daniel ben-Avraham developed a novel percolation-type approach and derived the first theory on the stability of realistic complex networks such as the Internet under random breakdown (Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 4626 (2000)) and intentional attacks (Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3682 (2001)). This study is particularly useful for optimizing the stability of networks against intentional attacks and viruses. They also derived a novel result about the “small world” nature of complex networks and found that the diameter of scale free networks is significantly smaller and then called them “ultrasmall worlds” (Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 58701 (2003)). Since 2010, Havlin and collaborators have focused heavily on interdependent networks.

Xylota is a genus of hoverflies similar in structure to the related genera "Chalcosyrphus" and "Brachypalpoides". As the larvae are saprophytic in rotting wood the adult flies are generally found associated with woodland and woodland edges and can often be seen running over the upper sides of leaves. Unlike other syrphids the adults of many species rarely visit flowers preferring instead to gather pollen from leaf surfaces. 
There are over 100 described species of which 12 can be found in Europe. Seven species have been recorded in Britain.

In around 1100 the site held the county chapel of the counts of Holland, rebuilt in 1121. The present building took approximately 180 years to build, starting in 1390. Famous Leiden dignitaries are buried there, including the painter Jan Steen and the Leiden professor Herman Boerhaave. The beautiful stained glass windows already took a terrible blow during the Beeldenstorm, but were completely destroyed a couple of centuries later, in the gunpowder explosion of January 12, 1807. The windows were boarded up, and it wasn't until 1880 that a large-scale restoration took place.
The "Pieterskerk" used to have a church tower, the "Westtoren" (west tower) from 1290 on. It was nicknamed "Coningh der Zee" (king of the sea), and was completed in stages, eventually reaching 110 meters (including the 35 meters tall wooden spire). It collapsed in the night of 5 March 1512. The tower was not restored and the church remained towerless.
The building was deconsecrated in 1971 and since 1975 is managed by a foundation and rented for a wide variety of events. Since 2001, with 50% government funding, a long-term restoration project has been started that will run until 2010. Discoveries made during this and earlier restorations are on permanent display in the church. A mummy is also on display, that the foundation has chosen not to subject to scientific scrutiny. Though the windows have been lost, the various grave monuments by prominent Leiden sculptors can still be seen. The building is open to the public.
Burials.
Before 1811 many prominent people were buried in the Pieterskerk, such as the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius (known for Arminianism), Herman Boerhaave, Jan Steen, and John Robinson, pastor of the "Pilgrim Fathers".

Glenn Melvin Allen

Glenn Melvin Allen, born , is a South African underwater rugby champion. He began his underwater rugby (UWR) career in 1993 after winning several informal tournaments most notably at the Margaret Maytom aquatic centre in Virginia, Durban. He eventually retired from the sport in 1997 (to pursue a business career) having won three South African UWR titles and became the face of UWR in South Africa.
His participation in UWR began with the more traditional field rugby, where in 1989 he starred as the Northlands Boys High School right wing. Throughout his high school field rugby career Allen showed a lot of promise but failed to fully reach his potential in the more traditional version of the game. It was in his final year in High School that Allen began entering informally arranged UWR tournaments.
At the time UWR was seen as a borderline sport with no organising bodies and no formal sports affiliations, the tournaments Allen began competing in were arranged informally between UWR enthusiasts and typically involved meeting at the Virginia UWR club headquarters the "Virginia Grill and Tavern" a local eatery. 
Throughout the summer of 1993 Allen began to make a name for himself in UWR circles as a genuine talent albeit with discipline problems. While Allen was building his formidable reputation, the sport of UWR was starting to develop along more traditional lines. Formal tournaments were arranged and the UWRSSA was formed (Under Water Rugby Society of South Africa), the UWRSSA began to formalise regional tournaments and in 1994 started the South African UWR national championships, this provided the platform for UWR legends such as Glenn "Poodle" Allen, Claudio "Luciano" Beltramini, Grant "Monkey" Oliver, Craig "Bushman" Davidson and Darren "Smoothie" Morgan. left the sport of UWR in 1996 to pursue field rugby and went on to play for the Natal Sharks and Springboks.
After the successes of 1993, the summer of 1994 proved to be a defining year for Allen, the sport he had been instrumental in founding had started to define itself with an official national body and provincial sub committees which ran the sport in the provinces co-ordinating district, regional and provincial championships. It was with the KZN UWR organising committee that Allen had his most publicised disputes with many in the sport referring to him as UWR's John McEnroe. Several disciplinary issues led to a three-week suspension in June 1994, most infamously the incident during the KZN duo finals.
In UWR "Duo's" is the most competitive and popular format, this involves a two man team competing in a specially reduced pool of no more than 10m x 5m.
The disciplinary incident in question happened during the 1994 KZN provincial duo championship, Allen was playing with his longtime duo partner Darren "Smoothie" Morgan, after his alleged popularity with the opposite sex against their fiercest duo rivals, the team of Craig Davidson and Claudio Beltramini, Allen was penalised by referee Garth Parsons for illegal use of the elbow late in the fourth quarter, this culminated with Allen out the pool and confronting a UWR official in Parsons, after physical contact with the referee, Allen was red carded leaving Morgan to play the last three minutes of the championship match alone (which amazingly Allen/Morgan won due to a 32-18 lead at the time of Allen's red card).
Allen spent the three-week suspension training hard and overcoming his mental shortcomings, to return to the pool in July 1994, in the meantime his duo partner Morgan had won the 1994 UWR National championship with stand in partner Grant Oliver.
Allen ended 1994 winning the Durban North classic regional tournament at the Ennisdale baths.
In 1995 Allen dominated the sport of UWR winning the singles, duo and team events, the duo final between Allen/Morgan and the Gauteng pair of Pienaar/Bothma was a UWR classic with the Durban team winning it on the final hooter. 
Regional and National championships were again won by Allen in 1996 earning him the 1996 UWR player of the year at gala awards dinner in Johannesburg.
In 1997 Allen met his future wife Fiona Harris and began contemplating a career in the business world, UWR may have been Allen's passion but it did not pay the bills. At the end of 1997 Allen retired from the then fledgling sport but not before scooping the duo title again with Morgan. Allen lost the singles title to Gary "Stabsie" Woolley an aggressive new up and coming player also from Allen's home town of Durban. Once again in this match controversy was not far away with Woolley accused of "illegal manhandling", many claim this tactic was enough to rob Allen of the 1997 title.
In 2005 Allen was inducted into the South African UWR hall of fame and has been instrumental in the development of UWR in South Africa.
Allen currently resides in Durban North and is a director of one of South Africa's biggest security firms, he has a 16 month old son named Luke.

Mordaunt Bisset

Mordaunt Fenwick Bisset (1825 – "c."August 1884) was a British Conservative Party politician and famous west-country Master of Staghounds.
Origins.
He was the only son of the Venerable Maurice Fenwick (1797–1879), Rector of Drumholm and Archdeacon of Raphoe, both in County Donegal, Ireland, son of William Fenwick of Lemmington Hall, Edlingham, Northumberland, by his wife Elizabeth Bisset. Maurice had married his cousin Jane Harriot Bisset (d.1866), the eldest daughter of Maurice George Bisset (1757–1821) of Lessendrum, Aberdeen, which manor had been held by the Clan Bisset since 1252, by his wife Harriat (sic) Mordaunt (b.1753) one of the illegitimate children of Charles Mordaunt, 4th Earl of Peterborough (1708–1779) by his mistress Robiniana Brown, who became his second wife in 1755. Maurice Fenwick adopted the additional name of Bisset following his wife's inheritance of the estate of Lessendrum from her father. His son Mordaunt Fenwick-Bisset inherited as well as Lessendrum, the residual estate, including the Wiltshire manor of Dauntsey, of Charles Henry Mordaunt, 5th Earl of Peterborough (1758–1814), his natural great-uncle, the first legitimate son of the 4th Earl by Robiniana, who died without progeny, and whose brothers, legitimate and otherwise had all predeceased him. The titles all became extinct. The Mordaunt property was left to Jane in trust as a life-interest, which was inherited absolutely on her death in 1866 by her son Mordaunt.
The arms of Fenwick-Bisset of Lessendrum are: "Quarterly 1st & 4th: Azure, a bend argent (Bisset), 2nd & 3rd: party per fesse gules and argent, six martlets counterchanged (Fenwick)".
Career.
He was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for West Somerset at the 1880 general election, but resigned from the House of Commons on 18 November 1883 by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead.
Sporting career.
He served as Master of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds from 1855 to 1881. He accepted the mastership when west-country stag-hunting was at a low ebb. In 1824 the entire pack of staghounds, of an ancient native bloodline, was sold by a previous master to a German Baron. Following this action, the wild deer were almost poached to extinction, the lack of sport having removed the main reason for their preservation in the eyes of the hard-pressed farmers whose crops they damaged. Mr Froude Bellew, MFH, offered a draught from his own pack of foxhounds to anyone who would re-established a pack of staghounds. Mr Bisset accepted the offer. His mastership was instrumental in increasing wild red deer numbers on Exmoor, he improved the breeding of the hounds and built permanent new kennels at Exford, which he donated to the Committee. In 1878 an outbreak of rabies occurred in the kennels, and he took the difficult decision to put-down all the hounds on 22 January 1879. He immediately started a new pack the same year, made up from a draught from Lord Rothschild's Staghounds.
He left 13 large volumes of his hunting diaries which became the property of Viscount Ebrington, later 4th Earl Fortescue his successor as Master, whose brother Hon. John Fortescue used them as a basis for his work "Record of Staghunting on Exmoor, London, 1887".
Marriage.
He married in 1851 Susan Popham, daughter and heiress of Francis Popham of Bagborough House, Bagborough, Somerset, and rented for his residence Pixton Park, near Dulverton, from the Earl of Carnarvon. He had no surviving progeny and his heir was his sister Janet.
Portraits.
His portrait was painted by Samuel John Carter and was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1871, under the catalogue description: ""A September evening, Exmoor Forest". A wild stag at bay with portraits; to be presented to the master of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds, Mordaunt Fenwick-Bisset Esq., at the beginning of his seventeenth season by upwards of 400 deer preservers and friends"". The painting was presented to him at a dinner at Dunster on 14 September 1871. He is shown on his hunter "Chanticleer" surrounded by his favourite hounds, with a stag at bay at Badgworthy Water, Exmoor Forest. An engraving of Bisset standing on a North Devon beach watching a hunted stag swimming away into the sea is published in Fortescue, op.cit., opposite p. 87, with the caption: "And there stood the stalwart form of Mr Bisset".
Death & burial.
He died in August 1884 and was buried at Bagborough.

Brita Sophia De la Gardie

Brita Sophia De la Gardie (1713–1797) was a Swedish noble and amateur actress. She was a central member of the cultural life in Stockholm in her time. She played a part in the history of Swedish theatre. She was the maternal aunt of Count Axel von Fersen the Younger. 
Biography.
Brita Sophia De La Gardie was born to the politician Count Magnus Julius De la Gardie and the political salonist Hedvig Catharina Lillie. She was the sister-in-law to the scientist Eva Ekeblad. During the 1720s and 1730s, amateur theatre was immensely popular in Stockholm and at the royal court. At the time, there were no Swedish language theatre in the capital; only foreign theatre companies performed professionally at the national stage of the Bollhuset Theatre. In 1732, "Dom Japhlet d'Arménie" by Scarron was performed at the stage of Bollhuset by the noble amateur troupe of Count Carl Gustaf Tessin and Countess Ulla Tessin, who also participated themselves. The most famous one of these amateur troupe was the troupe commonly known as "Greve De la Gardies komedianter (The Comedians of Count De la Gardie)" (active in 1734–1737), managed by the theatre-interested De la Gardie family. 
The De la Gardie amateur theatre performed in the palace "Torstensonska huset" (later known as now Arvfurstens palats) in the palace "Lefebuerska huset" and, occasionally, on the stage of Bollhuset Theatre, led by Höpken, between 1734 and 1737. Höpken had returned from Paris in 1734 and organized the troupe to perform more seriously and regularly than the other troupes. Brita Sophia De la Gardie was the lead female actor and star of this troupe. As such, she was well known in the city and a center of its cultural life. Historians have argued whether this troupe performed for the public and can be counted as more than an amateur troupe. According to memoirs, "The whole city" was present at the performances, but the upper-class memoirists may likely have referred to people from their own class. The plays may have been half public, with a symbolic sum paid by the audience, who likely came only from the city's upper-classes. 
These amateur troupes created an enthusiasm for native speaking theatre which prepared for the foundation of the first Swedish language national theatre at Bollhuset in 1737. The foundation of the national theatre had been laid by the performance of a student theatre troupe. When the first Swedish national theatre opened in 1737, a suggestion was made (serious or not) to make Brita Sophia an honorary consultant in the theatre management, with a reserved box at the theatre. This never came about. When the first professional actresses were hired to the theatre, it was jokingly suggested that another of the amateur actresses at the De la Gardie troupe, Augusta Törnflycht, should be asked to seek the position. One of the first professional Swedish actresses jointly with Beata Sabina Straas in the theatre troupe on the new national theatre, "Miss Wijkman" are suggested to have been Magdalena Wickman, earlier an employee at the De la Gardie household. 
In 1738 Brita Sophia became a member in the board of a musical academy who arranged concerts in the palace Lefebuerska huset. After the death of her father in 1741, Brita Sophia and her mother moved to Paris in France, where they converted to Catholicism. After her mother's death in 1745, she entered an convent and became a nun. She inherited Ekesjö manor in Sweden, but as she had not received royal consent to convert and as she remained in France, her property was sold by her siblings. She died in Paris.

Son of the Tree

Son of the Tree is a science fiction novella by Jack Vance. It was first published in "Thrilling Wonder Stories" magazine, June 1951, and in book form as half of an Ace Double in 1964 together with "The Houses of Iszm". The version that appears in the Ace Double is still less than novel length at about 31,000 words, but is essentially the same as the original magazine version. "Son of the Tree" was re-published as a stand-alone volume in 1974 by Mayflower.
Plot introduction.
One of Vance's earliest efforts, and part science fiction, part espionage story, protagonist Joe Smith has to contend with the machinations of various alien societies in search of the Earthman who ran off with his girl.
Plot summary.
"Son of the Tree" begins with the arrival of Joe Smith on the planet Kyril, so distant that Earth is but a myth. Kyril is dominated by a religious aristocracy called "Druids", who rule over the five billion commoner "Laity", and who control worship of the "Tree of Life" – a huge tree with a trunk five miles in diameter, and height of twelve miles. The Druids are xenophobic, and consider Joe to be a spy. For unknown reasons, he is befriended by Hableyat, a native of the world of Mangtse, self-admitted spy who finds him a job as a chauffer for Druid Princess Elfane.
After witnessing a murder committed by Princess Elfane's lover Manaolo, Joe Smith flees Kyril on the spaceship "Belsaurion" bound for the world Ballenkarch, his original destination – only to find that his fellow passengers include Hableyat, Manaolo and Princess Elfane, and that he is caught up as a pawn in a complex three-way political plot between the opposing worlds. Surviving a couple of murder attempts and puzzling over the intentions of Hableyat and Princess Elfane, he arrives on Ballenkarch, where he finds to his surprise that the earthman he was seeking has made himself ruling prince, with the woman he left behind on Earth as his princess. However, his biggest surprise is yet to come, when he discovers the horrific true nature of the so-called "Tree of Life".
Major themes.
The theme of trees with special powers connected to a religious sect recurs in a number of Vance's works, including "The Houses of Iszm" (where trees are the center of a society, similar to Kyril), "" (where “Druids” tend trees which can absorb people) and "The Gray Prince "(where a race of natives worship trees, which they climb to die). The theme of a religious orthodoxy dominating a society to its detriment is also in many of Vance's earlier works.

Its construction began in 1039 and it was inaugurated on 1 May 1048 by Bernold, Bishop of Utrecht (although the lost west towers were probably only finished about a century after the inauguration). The church was the eastern end of Utrecht's "Kerkenkruis", of which the Domkerk was the centre. Characteristic of the Romanesque style in which it is built are the church's large nave pillars, each hewn from one piece of red sandstone, and the crypt under the choir.

The Firefly is a 1937 musical film starring Jeanette MacDonald and Allan Jones. The film is an adaptation of the operetta of the same name by composer Rudolf Friml and librettist Otto A. Harbach that premiered on Broadway in 1912. The film used nearly all of the music from the operetta but jettisoned the plot in favor of a new storyline set in Spain during the time of the Emperor Napoleon I. It added a new song, "The Donkey Serenade", which became popular, as was one of the Friml songs, "Giannina Mia", both of which were released on 78 r.p.m. gramophone records.
Plot.
Secret agent Nina Maria Azara (Jeanette MacDonald) is working undercover for the King of Spain (Tom Rutherford) as a singer known as the "Mosca del Fuego" or "Firefly." Despite her love for Captain Andre (Allan Jones), she tricks him so that his general will change the French defensive positions, thus allowing the Duke of Wellington to win the Battle of Vitoria.

1972 European Super Cup

The 1972 European Super Cup was a football match played over two legs between the winner of the 1971–72 European Cup and the winner of the 1971–72 European Cup Winners' Cup. The match was proposed by Anton Witkamp "De Telegraaf" to decide who was the best club in Europe.
In 1972 Witkamp proposed the idea to Van Praag, the then president of Ajax, who were holders of the European Cup at that time. The idea was then taken to UEFA to seek official endorsement; however Artemio Franchi, the president of UEFA at that time, rejected the idea as the reigning European Cup Winners' Cup champions—Rangers—were serving a one-year ban at the time imposed by UEFA for the alleged misbehaviour of their fans.
The match went ahead, but unofficially as a celebration of the Centenary of Rangers F.C.. The first leg was played on 16 January 1973 and the second on 24 January 1973. Ajax won the tie 6–3 on aggregate, beating Rangers both at home and away, 3–1 in Glasgow and 3–2 in the second leg in Amsterdam. Despite not being officially reconigised by UEFA it is often regarded as the first ever European Super Cup match.

WHDI enables delivery of uncompressed high-definition digital video over a wireless radio channel connecting any video source (computers, mobile phones, Blu-ray players etc.) to any compatible display device. WHDI is supported and driven by Amimon, Hitachi Ltd., LG Electronics, Motorola, Samsung Group, Sharp Corporation and Sony.
Versions.
The WHDI 1.0 specification was finalized in December 2009. Sharp Corporation will be one of the first companies to roll out wireless HDTVs. AT CES 2010 LG Electronics announced a WHDI wireless HDTV product line.
In June 2010, WHDI announced an update to WHDI 1.0 which allows support for stereoscopic 3D, and WHDI 2.0 specification to be completed in Q2 2011.
WHDI 3D update due in Q4 2010 will allow support for 3D formats defined in HDMI 1.4a specification
WHDI 2.0 will increase available bandwidth even further, allowing additional 3D formats such as "dual 1080p60", and support for 4K × 2K resolutions.
Technology.
WHDI 1.0 provides a high-quality, uncompressed wireless link which supports data rates of up to 3 Gbit/s (allowing 1920×1080 @ 60 Hz @ 24-bit) in a 40 MHz channel, and data rates of up to 1.5 Gbit/s (allowing 1280×720 @ 60 Hz @ 24-bit or 1920×1080 @ 30 Hz @ 24-bit) in a single 20 MHz channel of the 5 GHz unlicensed band, conforming to FCC and worldwide 5 GHz spectrum regulations.

Russian reaction.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accused the States of using Operation Assured Delivery as a cover for delivering military support to Georgia. Media reports have suggested that USS "McFaul" docked in the Georgian controlled port of Batumi, rather than the primary Georgian port of Poti to avoid possible confrontation with Russian troops still in Poti. However, USS "Mount Whitney" docked in Poti. Russian authorities have been concerned of the ship's arrival, claiming that it can't bring much humanitarian aid, but instead bring significant U.S. surveillance capabilities to the area.

Andrei Eberhardt

Andrei Augostovich Eberhardt (, occasionally transliterated as Ebergard) (1856–1919) was an Admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy of Swedish ancestry.
Eberhardt graduated from the Marine Cadet Corps in 1878. From 1882 to 1884, he served in the Pacific Fleet as a signals officer. In 1886 he became a flag officer and adjutant to Admiral Shestakov (Minister of the Navy) and in 1891 he became a flag officer to Admiral Tyrtov commanding the Russian Pacific Squadron. In 1896 Eberhardt was moved to the Black Sea Fleet, where he was gunnery officer on the battleships "Ekaterina II" and "Chesma". In 1898 he moved to the Far East, where he commanded the "Admiral Nakhimov" and took part in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion.
During the Russo–Japanese War, Eberhardt was chief naval aide to Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, the viceroy of Manchuria. In 1905, he was captain of the Russian battleship Imperator Aleksandr II and in 1906 he was made captain of the Panteleimon. He was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1907 and Vice Admiral in 1909
Eberhardt was Russia's Chief of the Russian Naval General Staff from 1908 and Commander-in-Chief of the Black Sea Fleet from 1911. During World War I, his top achievement was setting up a naval blockade of Zonguldak coal fields, choking coal supply of the German-Turkish fleet. He also commanded the Russian battleship squadron during the Battle of Cape Sarych. However he was cautious to start further offensive actions against Turkish positions in Bosporus and was replaced by Aleksandr Kolchak in 1916.
Eberhardt retired from service in 1917 and was arrested by the Cheka in 1918 but released. He died in 1919 and is buried in the Novodeviche Cemetery in St Petersburg.

Winmor

WINMOR is a radio transmission protocol intended to be used in the Winlink 2000 Global Radio E-mail System by amateur radio operators, marine radio stations, and radio stations in isolated areas. WINMOR will complement the PACTOR modes in the high frequency portion of the Winlink system. WINMOR debuted at the 2008 ARRL / TAPR Digital Communications Conference. Unlike PACTOR II & III, only a simple computer soundcard-to-radio interface is required, as compared to PACTOR's relatively expensive external terminal node controller. It has two modes, either 500 or 1600 hertz in bandwidth, and provides ARQ speeds ranging from 67 to at least 1300 bits per second, similar to PACTOR's various modes. It is fully documented and without restrictions or license issues preventing anyone from using the protocol in other software. WINMOR supports both connected (ARQ) and FEC (broadcast) modes. 
Operational peer-to-peer (on-air) beta testing of WINMOR began on September 17, 2009. Deployment of RMS WINMOR servers for the Winlink system began in January 2010.

Walloon church

A Walloon church (French: "Église Wallonne"; Dutch: "Waalse kerk") describes any Calvinist church in the Netherlands and its former colonies whose members originally came from the Southern Netherlands and France and whose native language is French. Members of these churches belong to the Walloon Reformed Church (French: "Réformé wallon"; Dutch: "Waals Hervormd" or, prior to 1815, "Waals Gereformeerd"), a demonination of the long-distinguished Dutch-speaking Dutch Reformed Church.
The French Calvinists, known also as Huguenots, were persecuted in France by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1598, King Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes, which was to relieve the persecution and allow rights to freely worship. However, in 1685 his grandson Louis XIV issued a Edict of Fontainebleau, revoking the prior edict, and persecution returned. Many Huguenots fled France to other countries offering safe harbor, with large numbers settling in England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the Cape Colony and parts of the New World (particular the colonies of the Carolinas, New York and Pennsylvania). Many of the technical skilled workers of the silk weaving industry left France with little or nothing, re-establishing their trades elsewhere. Many of these who left were also of French nobility, and it is said that little of the industry of France remained after this period.

Universal War

Universal War (ВсеЛенская Война Ъ) is an artist's book by Aleksei Kruchenykh published in Petrograd at the beginning of 1916. Despite being produced in an edition of 100 of which only 12 are known to survive, the book has become one of the most famous examples of Russian Futurist book production, and is considered a seminal example of avant-garde art from the beginning of the twentieth century. 
Published at the height of Russian involvement in World War I (see Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive), the book attempts to echo the chaos and destruction of the war with the chaos and disruption of collage techniques new to the Russian Avant-Garde at the time, and opens with the bleak prophecy "Universal War will take place in 1985". Shortly after the book was published, Kruchenykh left Petrograd to live in a hut in the Caucausus to avoid the draft.
"One of the most outstanding merits of the album- a dadaist work in the fullest sense- is its successful realization of Kruchenykh's concept of collage as an artistic method transcending mere technique and capable of metaphorically expressing the 'discordant concordance' of the age." 
The book is an early attempt to link zaum poetry (often translated as 'transrational' or 'beyonsense' poetry) with 'zaum' images. In the foreword, Kruchenykh refers to the book as 'Poetic zaum shaking the hand of the pictorial zaum'.
"Universal War" is often erroneously credited as a collaboration between Kruchenykh and his wife, the artist Olga Rozanova. Whilst the pair often collaborated on artist's books-including "A Game In Hell" (1914) and "Transrational Boog" (1915)- most authorities now consider the work to be by Kruchenykh alone. A series of similar collages - also credited to Kruchenykh - in the book "1918" was published in Tiflis (Tbilisi) in January or February 1917, whilst Rozanova was still in Moscow and the Verbovka Village Folk Centre working for Malevich and, later, Izo Narkompros.
The emergence of Russian futurist books.
Kruchenykh had been a member of the Gileia group in Moscow that had published "A Slap In the Face of Public Taste", a manifesto/provocation, an early Succès de scandale that helped to establish Futurism in Russia. He left Gileia in 1912 to join the rival Donkey's Tail group. Each of the members would collaborate with Kruchenykh on his next three artist's books; "A Game In Hell", "Worldbackwards" and "Old-Time Love". These three publications set the tone for a radical deconstruction of the book format:
"If Kruchenykh had consciously set out to dismantle (nowadays we might say "deconstruct") the legacy of Johannes Gutenberg, it is unlikely that he could have done it more completely...In a series of remarkable book works of 1912 to 1920, Kruchenykh and his collaborators challenged this legacy in an unprecedentedly complete way, step-by-step departing from our European expectations about what a twentieth century book should be," Gerald Janecek
"Universal War" in Russian literature.
"Universal War" was an atypical book for Kruchenykh, since despite training as an artist, he usually only supplied the poetry for his books. This allowed collaborating artists such as Natalya Goncharova, Kazimir Malevich and Rozanova unusual levels of freedom to integrate their pictures with his hand-written words. "Universal War" featured his own collages, in an abstract style Kruchenykh referred to as 'Non-Objective'. The series of collages run parallel to the poetry printed on the first two sheets. Germany is depicted as a belligerent spiky helmet with its shadow, a black panther, fighting Russia.
The book starts with two pages of poems, under the headline "Universal War will take place in 1985" with page references to associate them with specific images. These poems are followed by 12 related collages, consisting of coloured sheets of card-mostly dark blue, but interspersed with grey, white and pink sheets- with various other papers and fabrics stuck to the sheets. Whilst the copies are similar, they show subtle differences.
Poetic and pictorial Zaum.
Zaum poetry attempted to “…lead the artist far beyond the restraints of socially sanctioned patterns and the vice of national vocabularies" and, whilst similar to Marinetti's insistence on the concrete nature of words, Kruchenykh insisted that Zaum was a liberation from meaning as well as form.
The poems are short, and are filled with onomatopeiac syllables;

chachen 
respact 
herself 
female 
tuningfork
Page 3—Explosion of a Trunk
with the queue full of whips 
cuts the stone with vengeance 
hil ble faes 
och fi ge 
In the preface Kruchenykh claimed that the collages were born of the same source as transrational language- 'the liberation of creation from unnecessary conveniences (through non-objectiveness)'. He cited the style as originating with Rozanova, and taken up by Malevich under 'the rather uninformative name' of Suprematism. In fact, the Russian avant-garde were well aware of Kandinsky's experiments with Abstract art. Kandinsky, a Russian living in Munich, regularly returned to Russia, and had contributed to "A Slap In The Face Of Public Taste" with a poem from "Klänge", an artist's book of sound poetry placed in tandem with abstract woodcuts, published in Munich, 1912. Another seminal artist's book, "La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France" by Blaise Cendrars and another Russian, Sonia Delaunay, had been exhibited in Russia in late 1913, and similarly linked colourful abstract images with concrete poetry.
The work pre-dates Hans Arp's similar experiments with abstract collages done for the Cabaret Voltaire, an early Dada venue, although it's not known if the two men were aware of each other's works.
Exile.
Unlike the Italian futurists, the attitude of the Russian futurists to the war and the Russian Revolution were at best ambiguous- Kruchenykh, like Kamensky, dodged the draft by retiring to a wooden hut in the Caucausus sometime in 1916. By 1917, he had moved to the newly independent (if short-lived), menshevik-controlled Democratic Republic of Georgia, and became a member with Ilia Zdanevich and Igor' Terent'ev of the avant-garde group 41°, centered at the Fantastic Cavern, an underground cabaret in downtown Tiflis. The scattering of artists during the revolution effectively brought Cubo-Futurism to an end, to be replaced by constructivism.
There are copies of "Universal War" in MOMA, New York, and in the Costakis collection.

Pan-American invert

As part of the Pan-American Exposition held in Buffalo in 1901 the United States Post Office Department issued a series of six commemorative stamps. Each stamp featured an ornate colored frame enclosing a black-and-white image of some means of (or adjunct to) modern rapid transportation. In the standard American Scott catalog, these six stamps carry the numbers 294-299. The first day of issue for the stamps was May 1, 1901.
The two color printing left the possibility of errors. Three of the denominations, 1 cent, 2 cents and 4 cents, were printed in sheets on which the center vignette was inverted relative to the frame. The inverts carry the Scott catalog numbers 294a, 295a, and 296a respectively.
While the 1 cent and 2 cent inverts reached post offices by accident, the 4 cent invert was printed deliberately as the result of a misunderstanding--and, in fact, never went on sale. After the discovery of the 1¢ and 2¢ inverts in mid-1901, the Third Assistant Postmaster, Edwin C. Madden, decided to track down any additional errors, and in late summer had his assistant instruct the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to send any inverted Pan-American stamps in their inventory to Madden's office. No inverted stamps in fact remained on hand, and proper procedure would have been for the Bureau to inform Madden that none were still in stock. However, interpreting Madden’s communique as an unconditional demand for inverts, the Bureau produced four sheets of them from the 4 cent plates and sent 400 copies on to Madden. The word "specimen" was then handstamped in purple ink on about half of the stamps. Between 1901 and 1904 Madden distributed 172 four cent inverts as gifts to friends, associates and his sons (also keeping one for himself), both with and without the overstamp. News of this prompted charges of impropriety and an official investigation by the Postmaster General, but Madden was cleared of any wrongdoing, given that no money had changed hands. Of the copies that remained, a pane of 100 went into the Government Collection of American Stamps in the Washington National Museum. The curator there later traded 97 inverts fom that pane to stamp dealers in exchange for examples of rare U. S. issues missing from the museum’s collection. (No record exists of what happened to the rest of the 400 original copies.)
The one cent invert is considerably more common than the others—still, the catalogue value of a set of all three inverts is estimated at $100,000 though one single stamp of each value was sold at auction in April 2009 for a total cost of $199,000 (respectively, $19,000; $90,000; $90,000). and a block of four of each invert value realised $1,146,000 in the same auction ($21,000; $800,000; $325,000).("Specimen" copies of the 4 cent invert command a considerably lower price than unmarked examples.) 
In 2001, for the centenary of the inverts issue, the USPS produced a souvenir sheet which contained reproductions of the three original inverts, along four 80-cent stamps based on a souvenir stamp circulated at the original Pan-American Exposition.

World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983

The World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 was an Act of the Parliament of Australia which provided for certain protections for World Heritage listed places.
The validity of the Act was considered by the High Court of Australia in "Commonwealth v Tasmania", also known as the Tasmanian Dams case. That case found several provisions of the Act to be invalid, but most of its major provisions were held to be valid.
The Act was repealed in 1999, and replaced by parts of the "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999".
History.
The "World Heritage Properties Conservation Bill" was introduced on 21 April 1983, by the then Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment, Barry Cohen.
The Tasmanian Dams case (1983) revolved around the validity of the Act. The High Court of Australia was asked separate questions about the validity of:
On the first part of question, the court held that s 6(1), (2)(b) and (3) were valid, but that it was not necessary to determine the validity of the other subsections. It held that s 9(1)(h) was valid, but that the remaining subsections of s 9(1) and (2) were invalid. On the second part of the question, the court found that s 7 was valid, and that s 10(1) and (4) were valid (the other parts of s 10 being unnecessary to consider). On the third part of the question, the court held both s 8 and s 11 invalid. It held that it was not necessary to answer the fourth part.
The Act was repealed in 1999 by Schedule 6 of the "Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Act 1999", as part of the reforms that saw the introduction of the "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999", which replaced several prior pieces of environmental legislation. It ceased to have effect on 16 July 2000.
Provisions.
The core of the legislation provided for a system of proclamations: sections 9, 10 and 11 set out certain acts which were unlawful if done with respect to properties or sites to which the sections applied, and sections 6, 7 and 8 respectively allowed the Governor-General of Australia to make proclamations declaring that those sections applied to certain eligible properties or sites. The three pairs of sections were set up to make use of three different powers available under the Constitution of Australia: the external affairs power, the corporations power and the race power.
Section 6 concerned sites of natural or cultural heritage value. It allowed proclamations to be made with respect to World Heritage nominated sites, sites which Australia was otherwise obliged to protect under international law, sites that were otherwise a matter of international concern, or sites "part of the heritage distinctive of the Australian nation". These overlapping provisions were designed to touch on different aspects of the external affairs power in the Constitution of Australia, and the last of these was designed to touch on the implied nationhood power.
If the Governor-General were satisfied that a property falling under the above definitions "is being or is likely to be damaged or destroyed" then they could make a proclamation with respect to that property. Once a proclamation was made under section 6, certain acts were prohibited by section 9, including carrying out excavation works, exploratory drilling, constructing "a building or other substantial structure" and felling any trees on the site.
Section 7 was far broader than section 6; it allowed the Governor-General to make proclamations with respect to "any identified property is being or is likely to be damaged or destroyed". However section 10, which set out the consequences of a proclamation under section 7, was narrow in its application; while it covered the same types of acts as section 9, it only made those acts unlawful if performed by certain corporations, namely foreign or trading corporations (that is, those corporations subject to the corporations power in the Constitution). Section 10(4) went further, and specifically made those same acts unlawful if done by such a corporation "for the purposes of its trading activities".
Section 8 allowed proclamations to be made with respect to sites of significance to Indigenous Australians, if either the sites themselves, or any artefacts or relics on them, were or were likely to be damaged or destroyed. Section 11 covered the same acts as described in sections 9 and 10, and rendered them unlawful if done with respect to properties subject to proclamations under section 8.
Once proclamations were made, they had to be tabled before both houses of the Parliament of Australia in accordance with the procedures set out in section 15. Proclamations could be revoked by the Governor-General once the threat of damage or destruction had passed.
Exceptions.
Section 12 provided certain statutory exceptions to the prohibitions in sections 9, 10 and 11, to do with acts permitted under management plans in other federal environment legislation, and acts permitted under state or territory law.
Sections 9, 10 and 11 each provided that acts normally prohibited by those sections would not be unlawful if done with the permission of the relevant Minister (then titled the Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment); section 13 set out the procedures to be followed by the Minister in granting such consent. Section 18 allowed the power to grant consent to be delegated.
Enforcement.
Section 14 granted jurisdiction to both the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia to grant injunctions restraining acts unlawful under sections 9, 10 or 11; such injunctions could be applied for by the Attorney-General of Australia, or by any "interested person" (which was defined in subsections 3 through to 5 of section 14).
Compensation.
Section 17 provided for a compensation scheme, in the event that any proclamation should amount to an acquisition of property within the meaning of section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution.

The technical problems were severe in comparison to the design of land based high frequency direction finding systems, due to the very detrimental effect of unwanted radio reflections from the ship's superstructure. The Germans considered the problem insoluble, and U-boats continued to use their high frequency radios to communicate with base stations in Western Europe, thus giving their positions to convoy escort vessels.
In his book 'Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunted, 1942-1945', the American naval historian Clay Blair Jr., refers to Struszynski's achievement as 'a breakthrough of transcendent importance'.
Struszynski subsequently worked at the Marconi Research Laboratories, Great Baddow, Essex, where he was a Consultant in communications research until his retirement.
The father of Wacław Struszyński was Professor Marceli_Struszyński, a member of the Polish resistance, who analysed the fuel used in the V2 rocket, the formula being subsequently sent to England.

Basilica of St Plechelm

The basilica of St Plechelm (Dutch: "Sint-Plechelmusbasiliek") is a Roman Catholic church in the Dutch town of Oldenzaal dedicated to the 8th-century Irish monk Saint Plechelm, whose festival on 15 July has been on the calendar of the medieval diocese of Utrecht ever since his canonisation in the 10th century. This festival is still celebrated annually at the basilica, and the saint's 1050th anniversary was celebrated there in 2004. The pope granted it the title of minor basilica in 1950.
History.
The oldest parts of the existing building date from the middle and the second half of the 12th century, but the history of the church goes back to the 8th century, when the traveling missionary Plechelmus founded the first church on the site, the Silvesterkerk, initially dedicated to pope Silvester and sometime before 954 rededicated to Plechelmus himself (canonised after the elevation of his relics). In 954, bishop Balderik of Utrecht founded a chapter in Oldenzaal and expanded and restored the 8th-century church, allowing the relics of Plechelmus used on his canonisation to be transferred to it. Since then had the Plechelmuskerk of Oldenzaal has had high status - for example, during the Middle Ages its chapter was one of only four outside Utrecht that could participate in electing the bishop of Utrecht.

Catharina Anna Grandon de Hochepied

Catharina Anna Grandon de Hochepied (21 May 1767 – 1803) was a Hungarian and Swedish noble. As the wife of the Swedish ambassador in the Ottoman Empire, she became the likely first woman ever to have performed on stage in Islamic Turkey.
Born to the Hungarian count Jan Daniel Grandon de Hochepied, she married Gerhard von Heidenstam, the Swedish ambassador of the Ottoman Empire, in 1783 and moved with him to Istanbul, where they lived.
Hedienstam organized an amateur theatre at the Swedish hotel in the Pera district of the city. In 1786, the theatre opened with the opera "L’ecole des Jaloux", the first Italian Opera ever performed in Turkey and, likely, in the Muslim world. The music was played by the embassy staff. Catharina Anna participated in the opera, together with a couple of other amateur actresses from the embassy staff's families, in front of three hundred spectators, thereby becoming perhaps the first woman ever to perform on a public stage in a Muslim country. She was complimented on her performance by members of the audience, which consisted of both foreign diplomats and Muslim nobles.

Fran Stallings

Fran Stallings is an American storyteller for people of all ages. She has performed at numerous national and international storytelling festivals, in schools and libraries, and on the radio. She performs primarily folktales from around the world. She has authored several audio recordings and books of stories and songs.
Stallings's storytelling style is noted for its ability to entrance listeners, a phenomenon she wrote about for "The National Storytelling Journal" in 1988. She teaches teachers to use stories in the classroom to hold students' attention while conveying lessons.
Biography.
Fran grew up in New York City but spent much of her childhood in Lancaster, Ohio, to which she attributes her Midwestern rather than New York accent. She began storytelling while caring for her four younger siblings; her mother was concerned that their imaginations would be stunted by growing up with television. 
She attended Wellesley College partly on the basis of their dance program but majored in biology after a campus job doing illustrations of botanitcal specimens aroused her interest in plant physiology, and a professor used storytelling in his lectures to interest her in chemistry She then attended the University of Wisconsin as a National Science Foundation Fellow in botany, studying cell differentiation in fungus. She met her husband, Gordon, when they were both in their senior year of undergraduate school. She worked as an assistant professor at a branch of Kent State University from 1970-1973 before following Gordon's work to Ann Arbor, Michigan and then to Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Finding no market for her botanical skills in Bartlesville, she pursued her interest in folktales and began storytelling in the classroom in 1978, while her two children were in elementary school. Her biology background and teaching experience both resurfaced as a thread in her storytelling: as "EarthTeller" she teaches science through stories.
Fran's scientific background (and young children) got her involved as a group leader in Bartlesville's La Leche League, and her connections there led her to local organizing to pass the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). When the ERA did not pass, and a spinal problem in 1980 caused her to spend most of a summer in bed, she picked up the phone and helped to organize a women's shelter, a gifted education program, and what became the Bartlesville Women's Network.
By 1985, while still recovering from spinal surgery, Fran began working as an artist-in-residence for the Oklahoma State Arts Council. In 1993 Fran visited Japan with her family and met Hiroko Fujita, a storyteller from Fukushima Prefecture, and the two began a professional partnership, touring the U.S. twelve times and Japan seven times from 1995-2008. Their partnership was awarded the International Storybridge Award in 2003.
In March, 2009, Fran won the Tejas Storytelling Association's John Henry Faulk award for "the person who has contributed the most toward the art of storytelling in the Southwest."

Prevention (album)

Prevention is the second studio album by Scottish indie rock band De Rosa, released on March 2, 2009 on both Chemikal Underground and Gargleblast Records. Regarding the album, guitarist Chris Connick stated that the album features "ten tracks of misery and place, from Lanarkshire," and noted that it "differ sonically from "Mend" quite a bit. The songs are more layered, and we used a lot more electronics and beats on this album. There’s also more emphasis on the album's coherence as a whole, and I think it plays better as a collection of songs than "Mend" did."
Vocalist and guitarist Martin Henry stated that: "the scratchy, falling-apart sound of parts of "Mend" frustrates me sometimes, so with "Prevention" I wanted to make something that was prettier and heavier at the same time. We were more interested in layers of vocals and instruments, with an emphasis on percussion, not just guitar. There are definitely a lot more keyboards on this one too.
The band worked with producer Andy Miller at Chem 19 recording studios in Lanarkshire, Scotland. Guest musicians on the album include Barry Burns of Mogwai and Robert Johnston of Life Without Buildings.
Artwork.
The album's front cover features artwork by Glasgow writer and artist Alasdair Gray. Guitarist Chris Connick notes that: Our friend Sorcha Dallas (and wife-to-be of Robert Johnson from Life Without Buildings, who played on our album) is an art dealer and gallery owner based in Glasgow. She helped put us in touch with Alasdair regards the cover art. Being a huge fan of Alasdair’s writing and in particular books such as "Lanark" and "1982, Janine", I was really excited and a bit scared when the sittings for the portrait came around. It was really cool to meet Alasdair and he turned out to be a lovely and engaging man, so I can thoroughly dismiss the adage “Never meet your heroes” as absolute bollocks.
Vocalist and guitarist Marin Henry notes that: The portraits were painted first, then there was the idea of a table with some meaningful objects. The map and the copy of "Mend" came from Alasdair a little later on and I remembered there being an old map lying about Chem19, where we recorded the album. The guitar in the image is my little acoustic. I write all of the De Rosa demos on it.
Track listing.
"Lyrics by Martin John Henry. Music by De Rosa."
Personnel.
The album also features choir vocals performed by a group of friends and family members of De Rosa.

Cyborg Soldier

Cyborg Soldier is a science fiction film released on October 7, 2008, directed by John Stead, and starring Rich Franklin, Tiffani Thiessen, and Bruce Greenwood.
Plot.
I.S.A.A.C. (Intuitive Synthetic Autonomous Assault Commando), played by former UFC Middleweight Champion Rich Franklin, is the first prototype of a secret "human weapon" program. Once a death-row inmate, he is now a genetically reconstructed, highly trained, deadly assassin whose body and mind have been modified to become a physically regenerative, intellectually superior human being.
While on the run, I.S.A.A.C. takes Deputy Lindsay Rearden (Tiffani Thiessen; "Beverly Hills, 90210") hostage. Their lives are in jeopardy from military agents being led by robotics engineer Simon Hart (Bruce Greenwood; I, Robot; ). Deputy Reardon and I.S.A.A.C. work together to expose the military group constructing the super beings.
Critic Review.
While obviously made on a B-grade budget, the plot follows a typical scenario of this type of action movie. Fans of Universal Soldier (Cluade Van-damme) will likely enjoy the escaped cyborg out for retribution element. 
While there are some unintentional funny moments, which I won't give away, for those that enjoy such things they may even enjoy this title.
It's not the movie to watch with your lady friend (unless she's into this style of movie) as its certainly no chick flick or family movie. However, if you're a male in the target audience age range and don't take this movie to seriously you may like aspects in it.
Final thoughts, while it's not the best movie in the dvd store's shelves, you might consider it in somewhere in the middle half of the B'grades in store, which you haven't watched yet.

Wang Yongchen () is the Senior Environment Reporter for China National Radio. Wang founded Green Earth Volunteers, a Chinese environmental NGO, in 1996. She is the president of the group and organizes many of its activities.
Biography.
Wang Yongchen received her graduates' degree at Peking University. She worked as a journalist specializing in the environment. A pioneer of radio programs for the environment, she founded "Classroom on Wednesday" and "Journalists' Salon," which encourage public awareness as well as debate. She specifically hopes to increase awareness on the relationship between humans and nature and the social responsibility in the protection of nature.
She has received many awards for her reporting including the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union prize in 1993, 1999 and 2001, the Condé Nast Traveler Environmental Award in 2004, and the Earth award or Globe award in 2001. The latter is China's most esteemed environmental award. She contributed the Earth award prize money, a sum of 20,000 RMB, to China's Environmental Foundation and founded the Green Earth Education Fund.
Involvement with the Nu River.
The Nu River, in southwestern China, is one of only two major rivers in China that remain undammed. Proponents of the dam project said it was a prime source for hydroelectricity, and said it would lift locals out of poverty. Opponents said it threatened the area’s cultural and ecological diversity. The Nu River is home to more than 7,000 plant species, more than half of China's animal species, and some 22 ethnic minority groups.
Wang organized a campaign to stop dam projects on the Nu River. Their efforts led to Premier Wen Jiabao's announcement in April 2004 to put the dam project on hold due to concerns about the environment and ethnic minorities. The project could still be completed despite the fact that many locals do not support the project. In August 2005, scores of Chinese organizations and individuals signed an open letter to the government, asking the authorities to publish environmental-impact documents and hold public hearings on the Nu River plans. By August 2006, the government still had not responded to the open letter.
In February, contractors claimed the Nu River project was set to begin, with the project developer, China Huadian, beginning initial preparations. But it is still unclear whether the project received final approval from Beijing. A local government official reportedly denied the dam had been approved, saying a mandatory green assessment by the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) was still pending.
Positions.
Wang thinks it is a false choice to choose between economic development and environmental protection:
"The biggest problem in increasing awareness, I think, is that environmental protection still involves nothing but slogans. While many people see a conflict between economic development and environmental protection, I believe that when you come closer to nature to learn more about it, you will find no real conflict between the two. On the contrary, a deteriorating environment makes economic development a 'mission impossible.' It is just like when people sacrifice health to make money and then have to spend that money to recover their health. The Green Earth Volunteers is a big family of nature lovers. If you are interested in our goals, just join us and you will be surprised at how much you will enjoy."
Works.
Wang publishes articles for chinadialogue, which are available in Chinese and English.

Hey Monday

Hey Monday is an American rock band from West Palm Beach, Florida, formed in 2008 and are currently on a hiatus as of December 2011. They released their debut album "Hold on Tight" in 2008 which produced singles "Homecoming" and "How You Love Me Now". The album was followed up with their 2010 EP "Beneath It All", which achieved moderate commercial success, and "Candles" EP in 2011. "The Christmas EP" came on December 6 later that year. The group has toured extensively both as supporting acts and headliners, and have appeared on Warped Tour. Hey Monday has toured with bands such as Fall Out Boy, All Time Low, Yellowcard and We The Kings. Hey Monday is currently on hiatus and claims to not be "broken up". Lead singer Cassadee Pope pursued a solo career and subsequently won season three of "The Voice".
History.
Formation and "Hold on Tight".
Hey Monday was formed in March 2008 after Cassadee Pope and Mike Gentile's former band Blake broke up. Pope and Gentile wanted to continue playing music and began holding auditions for a new band around their local Florida music scene. Pope and Gentile quickly joined forces with drummer Elliot James who then recruited rhythm guitarist Alex Lipshaw. Soon afterward they enlisted bassist Michael "Jersey" Moriarty and Hey Monday was formed. They were discovered when Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz heard one of their demos while he was in the Crush Management office. Wentz wanted to sign them to his label, Decaydance, but Columbia Records was also interested so the band ended up signing a joint deal with both labels. They recorded their debut album, Hold On Tight, throughout the summer of 2008 and it released later that fall on October 7 to very minor commercial success; it charted on "Billboard" Heatseekers albums. Soon after their debut album dropped, Hey Monday began extensive touring with the likes of The Academy Is..., We The Kings, The Cab, This Providence, A Rocket To The Moon, VersaEmerge, and Cash Cash. That following year they supported Fall Out Boy on both their major U.S. and international tours. Their popularity grew and the band went on their first headlining tour with This Providence, The Friday Night Boys, Stereo Skyline, and The Bigger Lights as support. They also headlined a few dates in Europe. In the fall of 2009 they supported All Time Low on the Glamour Kills Tour.
Departure of Elliot James.

George Sandford

George Montagu Warren Sandford ("c."1821 - 17 June 1879), known until 1886 as George Montagu Warren Peacocke, was a British Conservative Party politician.
At the 1852 general election, Sandford (as Peacocke) was elected Member of Parliament for Harwich but his election was voided on petition in the following year.
Sandford won a by-election at Maldon in August 1854 where the 1852 election had also been declared void. He was defeated in 1857, re-elected in 1859, and 1865, but defeated again when Maldon's representation was reduced to one seat in 1868. He was re-elected in 1874, and held the seat until he resigned from the House of Commons on 5 December 1878 by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead.

Eucalyptus longifolia

Eucalyptus longifolia, known by the common name woollybutt, is a tree of the myrtle family myrtaceae native to eastern Australia. It has thick, fibrous bark usually colored light gray and white, and long narrow grey-green leaves. The drooping flowerheads in groups of three are a distinguishing feature. It grows in heavy soils often near water.
Taxonomy.
The woollybutt was described by German naturalist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link in 1822. The specific epithet is the Latin words "longus" "long" and "folium" "leaf". Within the genus "Eucalyptus", it belongs in the subgenus "Symphyomyrtus". The term woollybutt relates to the bark.
Description.
"Eucalyptus longifolia" grows as a tall tree to 35 m (100 ft) high, with a trunk diameter attaining 1 m (3 ft). The long narrow leaves are lanceolate (spear-shaped) and measure 10–25 cm (4–10 in) long and 1.5–2.6 cm (0.6–1 in) wide. They are a uniform grey-green or blue-green in colour. The white flowerheads are arranged in groups of three, and droop.
Distribution and habitat.
The range is from Morisett in central New South Wales south to the Victorian border. In the north of its range it is more scattered in its distribution, but becomes more common south of Nowra to Bega. It generally grows on clay soils and floodplains, sometimes in areas with poor drainage, in valleys and low areas. In open sclerophyll forest, it grows alongside such trees as white mahogany ("E. acmenoides"), grey box ("E. moluccana"), forest red gum ("E. tereticornis"), and rough-barked apple ("Angophora floribunda"), while in swampy areas it is found with swamp mahogany ("E. robusta") and paperbark species such as snow-in-summer ("Melaleuca linariifolia"), prickly paperbark ("M. styphelioides") and swamp paperbark ("M. ericifolia").
Ecology.
The woollybutt regenerates by regrowing from epicormic buds after bushfire. Trees live for over a hundred years. The Grey-headed Flying Fox ("Pteropus poliocephalus") and Little Red Flying Fox ("P. scapulatus") eat the flowers. The longhorn beetle species "Paroplites australis" has been recorded from the woollybutt.
Uses.
The dark red timber is hard and resistant to water, and termites. It has been used in railway sleepers and other general construction. The woollybutt is also important in beekeeping and the honey industry. It is useful as a shade tree or windbreak in paddocks, but grows too large for the average garden.

William J. Hamblin

William James Hamblin (born 1954) is a Mormon apologist and professor of history at Brigham Young University (BYU). He is a former board member of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) at BYU.
Biography.
Hamblin served as an LDS missionary in Italy from 1973–75.
Hamblin received his bachelors degree in history from BYU. He did his graduate studies from the University of Michigan, receiving an M.A. in history in 1981, an M.A. in Near East Studies in 1984, and a Ph.D. in history in 1985. The title of his Dissertation was "The Fatimid Army During the Early Crusades". Prior to joining the faculty of BYU in 1989, Hamblin was a history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi, an instructor at Campbell University and a middle east intelligence analyst for the United States Department of Defense. Hamblin contributed many articles to "The International Military Encyclopedia".
Hamblin lives in Provo, Utah with his wife, Loree, née Peay. They have three children. He has taught as a professor at the BYU Jerusalem Center and is currently teaching at Brigham Young University in the History Department.
Apologetics.
Hamblin is perhaps best known in his role as a Mormon apologist. He has written on archaeology and the Book of Mormon, both in general articles for the "Journal of Book of Mormon Studies" and in response to criticisms to the historicity of the Book of Mormon.
Controversy over personal attacks.
After becoming upset with Brent Metcalfe, a scholar who had criticized the Book of Mormon, Hamblin published a paper in the 1994 FARMS Review which included an encrypted message stating "Metcalfe is Butthead." After the Review went to press, the editors became aware of this barb and hastily removed it. Metcalfe expressed surprise that Hamblin "would stoop to such an inane level." Jerald and Sandra Tanner, frequent critics of the LDS church, characterized this as simply another example of Hamblin's personal attacks on those who criticize his work or the LDS church.

Codex Basiliensis A. N. IV. 1

Codex Basiliensis A. N. IV. 1, known as "Minuscule 2" (on the Gregory-Aland), ε 1214 (in Soden's numbering). It is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, dated palaeographically to the 11th or 12th century. It was used by Erasmus in his edition of Greek text of the New Testament and became the basis for the Textus Receptus in the Gospels. The manuscript has complex contents.
Description.
The codex contains a complete text of the four Gospels on 248 parchment leaves with size (text only ). The text is written in 1 column per page, 20 lines per page, in minuscule letters and contains ornaments in colour, the initial letters in red.
The text is divided according to the ("chapters"), whose numbers are given at the margin (not in John), and their ("titles of chapters") at the top of the pages. There is also another division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections. Matthew is divided into 359, Mark – 240, Luke – 342, and John into 231 Ammonian Sections (common accepted number of the Ammonian Sections: 355, 235, 343, 232). There is no references to the Eusebian Canons.
The tables of the ("tables of contents") are place before each Gospel and subscriptions at the end of each Gospel. Some leaves of the codex were lost, but the text of the Gospels has survived in complete condition.
Text.
The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden classified it to the textual family Kx. Aland placed it in Category V. Hermann von Soden classified it to the textual family Family Kx. According to the Claremont Profile Method it has mixed Byzantine text in Luke 1. In Luke 10 and Luke 20 it represents Kx.
The text is not good.
In Luke 6:28 it lacks phrase . It was added by one of correctors in the lower margin.
In John 8:6 it used textual variant μη προσποιουμενος, erased by corrector. Τhis variant have also the manuscripts 07, 011, 017, 028, 041, and majority of the Byzantine manuscripts. It is not included by the manuscripts 021, 028, 030, 036, 045, 047, 7, 8, 9, 196, 461c2, 1203, 1216, 1243, 1514, ℓ "663". Erasmus did not use this phrase in his Novum Testamentum.
History of the codex.
The early story of the manuscript and its provenance is unknown. The codex was bought by monks at Basel for two Rhenish florins. Since 1559 it was held in the University of Basel. Its later story is the same as that of Codex Basilensis and Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2. 
Desiderius Erasmus received this codex from the Dominican monks at Basel, and chiefly used it as the basis for the Gospels portion of the first edition of his "Novum Testamentum" (1516), with press corrections by his hand, and barbarously scored with red chalk to suit his page format. 
Robert Estienne did not directly consult this manuscript in his Editio Regia (1550), but since his edition was based on the Erasmian text, 2's readings became a basis for the Textus Receptus. 
Martin Crusius used this manuscript in 1577. The manuscript was examined by Bengel (codex β), Wettstein, Burgon, Hoskier, Gregory. According to Bruce M. Metzger it is one of the inferior manuscripts used by Erasmus. Wettstein gave for it number 2 on his list. This siglum is still in use.
The codex is located now at the Basel University Library (A.N. IV. 1) at Basel.

Construction Photography

Construction Photography is a photo library and agency based in London, England. It was established in 2001 to provide the construction and built environment industries an alternative to multinational agencies such as Getty images and Corbis.
Using digital asset management software technology Construction Photography delivers creative content over the internet to government organizations such as Transport for London, Highways Agency, ConstructionSkills, Waste & Resources Action Programme as well as multinational corporations such as Vinci Plc, Lafarge, Compass Group, Corus Group, Gardiner & Theobald, Murphy Group. etc.).
Construction Photography is the largest supplier of images for the construction industry worldwide. It has a stock collection of over 100,000 built environment related images of which 30,000 are available online and 170 assignment photographers operating from 15 countries.
Line of business and skills.
Image licensing and search.
The library licence Managed and Free images from content providers, photographers, agencies, museums and libraries around the world. In 2007 Construction Photography signed an agreement with the Russian state news agency Ria novosti to represent its built environment content worldwide. In March 2005 Construction Photography launched a search engine including a feature called “Image Weight”. The search results are primarily ordered by image weight. Images increase in weight when users add them to a lightbox or a cart or open an image preview or large preview. Each action has a different weight. Images decrease in weight when they are removed from a lightbox or from the cart. An algorithm calculates in real time all these parameters to give each image a constant updated weight. Also included in the algorithm are the upload date and the keyword relevance to the search.
Commercial libraries have the constant dilemma of how to show chosen images to their users, as search results order relying mostly on the choice of editors based on their knowledge and experience. This proved a very subjective approach and a time-consuming effort for the administrators of the website, ranking images manually and updating the ranking order on a daily basis with new content being uploaded. With Construction Photography's Image Weight system, customers have a direct influence over the image results as most relevant and popular images are returned first.
In 2007 Construction Photography launched improvements to its "Image Weight" system with the ability for their editors to overwrite weighting on a batch or on single image in order to promote quickly new content, exclusive imagery or simply outstanding visual content. Royalty Free and Rights Managed images can have different weight algorithm depending on sales strategy.
Photo assignments.
The agency produces imagery for most industries within the built environment: construction, engineering, architecture, property development and house building, machinery, rail and energy. Clients can order shoots and edit them online with images uploaded on editing galleries within minutes after a shoot.
Company skills include:
Video production.
The agency focuses on broadcast quality content, media products and services for business-to-business, business-to-customer and business-to-employee communications.
Media management.
Construction Photography is the exclusive distributor of The Data Archive media management software "(The Data Archive is the parent company of Construction Photography)". The web-based digital assets management software helps companies within the built environment to manage their media content over the internet including photographs, videos, any type of media files or documents. The secure service also includes hosting, metadata management and data migration.
Awards.
Construction Photography was a finalist for the 2007 Construction Industry IT Awards organised by Contract Journal, the UK weekly magazine for the construction industry published by RBI (Reed Business Information). The agency was a finalist again for the Quality in Construction 2008 Awards organised by Construction News, the other main weekly magazine published by Emap Construct for Excellence in use of ICT.
Industry membership.

Fonte de Aldeia

Fonte de Aldeia is a parish in the municipality of Miranda do Douro, Portugal, which is located 15 kilometres south of Miranda do Douro proper, directly on the Spanish-Portuguese border. The village presumably dates back to a Roman fort that existed on Mount Trinidad and of which there are almost no traces left. Fonte de Aldeia was first recorded in the "Torre do Tombo" register in 1528.
Economy.
Aldeia is a rural village in the heart of the Mirandês plateau, which mainly depends on agriculture and livestock. Often the traditional farmwork is still carried out manually, though this is being replaced by mechanised farming.
History and traditions.
Fonte de Aldeia was home to a wealthy religious order, which also had possessions in neighbouring Castile. Each friar offered a certain quantity of cereals, which was deposited in a barn (that still exists) to serve as a loan to families in need. In addition to the twelve annual Holy Masses which are still held today in memorial of the souls of the dead friars, there is also one single grand church service with a large number of priests for the same purpose.

Hurricane Hanna (2008)

Hurricane Hanna was the deadliest storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm was the eighth tropical cyclone and fourth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands on August 28. The cyclone struck Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, before moving up the Eastern Seaboard to become an extratropical cyclone as it moved by New England into Atlantic Canada early on September 7. The system raced across the North Atlantic, sweeping west of Great Britain on September 10 before turning north and becoming absorbed by a stronger extratropical cyclone between Iceland and Greenland late on September 12. At least 537 deaths were reported (the final death toll will likely never be known), mostly due to flooding in the northern part of Haiti, making it the deadliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Stan in 2005. Hanna also caused $160 million in damages to the U.S, but the exact damage in Haiti is unknown. The next hurricane to impact the New York area was Hurricane Irene in 2011.
Meteorological history.
During late August 2008, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. After several days, an associated area of low pressure gained deep convection and organization. On August 28, while to the east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, the low formed into Tropical Depression Eight. Later that day, it attained tropical storm status, and as such was named "Hanna" by the National Hurricane Center. At the time, the low-level center of circulation was partially exposed on the western edge of the convection, indicating westerly wind shear.
Early on September 6, 2008, Hanna made landfall near the South Carolina-North Carolina border. The system became an extratropical cyclone as it moved into Atlantic Canada early on September 7 and raced across the North Atlantic, sweeping west of Great Britain on September 10 before turning north and becoming absorbed by a stronger extratropical cyclone between Iceland and Greenland late on September 12.
Preparations.
In the Turks and Caicos, streets were cleared and schools and airports were closed ahead of Hanna's arrival. Transportation on and off the Island was stopped until the system lightens or passes.
NASA also announced that the movement of the Space Shuttle Atlantis to the launchpad for Flight STS-125 from the Kennedy Space Center would be pushed up a day due to the threat of Hanna. Amtrak also canceled some train routes that run through the southeast United States.
In Wilmington, North Carolina, the University of North Carolina at Wilmington canceled all classes and activities for Friday, September 5, and Saturday, September 6, in preparation for the storm, and issued an advised voluntary evacuation. UNCW officially closed at noon on Friday, and reopened at noon on Saturday, after the storm had passed. Specifically Wagoner Dining Hall, Randall Library, and the Student Recreation Center were reopened to students. Classes resumed regular schedules on Monday, September 8.
Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia canceled all class and activities on Friday and Saturday and issued a mandatory evacuation due to fears of a power outage. The College of William & Mary and Old Dominion University nearby had not made any similar plans. Old Dominion University and nearby neighboring school Norfolk State University did cancel classes for both Friday afternoon, and Saturday, due to the possibilities of heavy rain and wind. Two other Hampton Roads schools, Regent University and Virginia Wesleyan College, did not close on Friday, but Regent closed completely on Saturday, while Virginia Wesleyan canceled classes on Saturday but otherwise remained open.
On Friday, September 5, NASCAR announced that they would postpone the NASCAR Nationwide Series Emerson Radio 250 (scheduled to be run that evening) and the next day's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Chevy Rock and Roll 400 until Sunday afternoon after Hanna had moved north of Virginia. Both races were held at the Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, VA. With a delay in the storm during the day on September 6, the US Open tennis tournament went on, but was eventually cancelled as the rains came. Nearby at Shea Stadium, the baseball game between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies was cancelled in advance of the storm, rescheduled as a day-night doubleheader on September 7.
On Friday, September 5, rural water associations along the east coast and neighboring states prepared staff and equipment to respond to emergencies. Associations activated their mutual aid networks, preparing for the landfall of Hanna and Hurricane Ike while still providing assistance to areas impacted by Hurricane Gustav. On September 5, 2008 the Emergency Measures Organization of the Canadian province of New Brunswick issued a warning to expect "significant rainfall" and "localized flooding" on September 7, 2008 and September 8, 2008.
In Long Island, power companies were preparing for a minimal hurricane to be fully prepared for the first real test of New York's readiness for a strong storm impacting the region. In Nassau, phone calls were attempted to volunteer fire departments but at the same time, calls were being made to 193,000 residences about the West Nile Virus, slowing down phone connections. Over 800 workers were on standby in case anything were to happen due to the storm.
Impact.
Turks and Caicos Islands.
On September 1, widespread rain and strong winds were reported in the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands as a result of Hanna. No major damage or fatalities were reported in either area.
Hanna returned to the area and in the Turks and Caicos, floods hit low-lying neighborhoods throughout the archipelago. The popular tourist destination of Providenciales saw considerable flooding in neighborhoods such as Kew Town, Five Cays and the Blue Hills. Also a medical clinic on the Grand Turk island suffered roof damage.
Hispaniola.
Haiti, already rain-saturated by Fay and Gustav, was hit hard by flooding and mudslides from several days of heavy rainfall, particularly in the city of Gonaïves which also suffered catastrophic damage in 2004 from Hurricane Jeanne. Nearly the entire city was flooded with water as high as 2 meters (6.6 feet) deep, and some people had to be rescued on their roofs. In Les Cayes, a hospital had to be evacuated as it was swamped by flood water. At least 5,000 people there were moved to public shelters due to the flooding. The United Nations have ordered relief convoys to the hard-hit region, including rafts to help rescue victims. As of late on September 4, Haiti's government said the death toll from Tropical Storm Hanna had increased to at least 529, with most of the deaths coming in the flooded port city of Gonaïves, where the destruction was described as "catastrophic" and 495 bodies were discovered as of late on September 5. Haitian authorities said the tally could grow once officials are able to make their way through Gonaïves. "The assessment is only partial, because it is impossible to enter the city for the moment", Gonaïves Mayor Stephen Moise said.
In the aftermath of Hanna at least 48,000 from the Gonaïves areas went to shelters. Some people slept on the roofs of their house to protect them from looters. The catastrophe has left many homeless
begging for food and clothes. Others had left for the mountains hoping to wait out the next storms on the horizon.
People are starting to get frustrated with the assistance that has come. Very little aid has come from international organizations.
Bridges north and south of Gonaïves collapsed and the roads are swampy lakes and it is extremely difficult to get to the city by road.
Over a week after Hanna brushed the Dominican Republic, the body of a fisherman who drowned in the storm was found in the Atlantic just off the northern coast.
United States.
While in the Atlantic near the Bahamas, high surf and rip currents were produced by Hanna off the Southeast US coast. A 14-year-old boy drowned at John U. Lloyd Beach State Park near Hollywood, Florida as a result of the rip currents brought up by the distant Hanna. Two more deaths were reported off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida as they drowned in the high seas. Because of the threat of a medium-term impact on the state and anticipated track of the storm, the governors of Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland declared a state of emergency for their states and commonwealth. Washington, D.C., along with numerous other state and municipalities activated their Emergency Operations Centers in preparation for the storm. Hanna may have also spawned tornado(s) near Greenville, North Carolina and Allentown, Pennsylvania.
After landfall in the Carolinas, Hanna was at its strongest when its center was just south of New York City at 11 pm EDT on September 6, when 60 mph (95 km/h) winds were recorded at the center, however, because most winds past the center were more gusty than sustained, most damage in the area was related to the rain. A 38-year-old man drowned due to rip currents in New Jersey as Hanna approached. Hanna knocked out power to about 32,000 people on Long Island as it quickly passed through on September 6.

Government.
The purpose of Village Development Committees is to organise village people structurally at a local level and creating a partnership between the community and the public sector for improved service delivery system. A VDC has a status as an autonomous institution and authority for interacting with the more centralised institutions of governance in Nepal. In doing so, the VDC gives village people an element of control and responsibility in development, and also ensures proper utilization and distribution of state funds and a greater interaction between government officials, NGOs and agencies. The village development committees within a given area will discuss education, water supply, basic health, sanitation and income and will also monitor and record progress which is displayed in census data.
In VDCs there is one elected chief, usually elected with over an 80% majority. From each ward, there is also a chief that is elected along with these there are also four members elected or nominated.

The single was released on the Bronze label with catalogue reference BRO 50, and the track spent 11 weeks in the chart. Their lead vocalist was Peter 'Quackers' McDonald. Their lack of subsequent chart success made Goldie a one-hit wonder.
The band performed and recorded together for four years, and appeared on the TV show "Top of the Pops". The group disbanded in 1980. Geoff Robson, their bass guitarist, appeared on series 25 of "Never Mind the Buzzcocks" in September 2011.

Government.
The purpose of Village Development Committees is to organise village people structurally at a local level and creating a partnership between the community and the public sector for improved service delivery system. A VDC has a status as an autonomous institution and authority for interacting with the more centralised institutions of governance in Nepal. In doing so, the VDC gives village people an element of control and responsibility in development, and also ensures proper utilization and distribution of state funds and a greater interaction between government officials, NGOs and agencies. The village development committees within a given area will discuss education, water supply, basic health, sanitation and income and will also monitor and record progress which is displayed in census data.
In VDCs there is one elected chief, usually elected with over an 80% majority. From each ward, there is also a chief that is elected along with these there are also four members elected or nominated.

Harry Dansey

Harry Delamere Barter Dansey MBE (1 November 1920 – 6 November 1979) was a New Zealand Māori journalist, cartoonist, writer, broadcaster, local-body politician, and race relations conciliator.
Early life.
Harry Dansey was born in Greenlane, Auckland, New Zealand to Harry Delamere Dansey, a civil engineer, and his wife Winifred Patience Dansey (née Barter).
Dansey began his education at Remuera Primary School in the Auckland suburb of Remuera. His family moved to Rotorua in 1930, where he completed the rest of his primary education, and then high school from 1934 to 1939. He had a knack for English, and his father instilled in him a love for Māori culture, somewhat influencing his career.
He married Te Rina Makarita (Lena Margret) Hikaka on 19 May 1943 at Oeo, near the town of Manaia, Taranaki.
He was a member of the 28th (Māori) Battalion during World War II in North Africa and Italy. Dansey often scouted ahead to gather intelligence information to aid the advancement of the Battalion. This required him to sketch landscapes and buildings, which he enjoyed. While in Italy, Dansey was assistant to Corporal Arapeta Awatere. He was discharged from the Army in 1946, reaching the rank of Sergeant.
Journalism career.
Dansey first started his journalism career when he completed an apprenticeship with the "Hawera Star", before moving on to become editor and part-owner of the "Rangitikei News". His family then moved to New Plymouth where he took up a position with the Taranaki Daily News. This was where he started his cartoon-drawing for multiple newspapers.
He also enjoyed the freedom of freelance journalism and social commentary, contributing to the Māori-aimed magazine "Te Ao Hou - The New World", and commenting on Māori issues on radio. This led to him and his family moving to Auckland where he earned the position as a writer on Māori and Pacific Island affairs at the Auckland Star.
Dansey wrote a full-length play in 1971, "Te Raukura: the feathers of the albatross", which first played in 1972 at the Auckland Festival.
In 1974, Dansey was made Member of the Order of the British Empire for his contributions to journalism.
Race relations conciliator.
Dansey was appointed New Zealand's second race relations conciliator in 1975. This entailed investigating complaints, and mediation. He stressed the need for people to respect other cultures, and he consulted and trained in business, government, legal and professional organisations. He believed that New Zealand would develop its own unique culture, derived from both Māori and European culture. Dansey became a member of the Human Rights Commission in 1978.
Other interests and vocations.
Dansey was elected to the Auckland City Council in 1971, serving until 1977 with a reserve in Central Auckland being named in his honour, recognising his contribution to the city. In 1973, he moved to the Department of Māori Affairs to further develop the Department's public relations profile.
Besides journalism, politics, cartooning and theatre, Dansey became interested in radio broadcasting, and subsequently became one of station 1ZB's first talkback hosts, and was also a frequency to current affairs programmes.
Later life and death.
Dansey retired from his role as race relations conciliator in October 1979, dying a few weeks later. He was survived by his wife, three sons and one daughter.
He was buried with his relations at Muruika cemetery in Ohinemutu, Rotorua.

Marynell Meadors

Marynell Meadors (born August 27, 1943) is an American women's basketball coach at the college and professional level. She most recently served as head coach and general manager of the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association and was one of the original eight head coaches when the WNBA started in 1997.
Biography.
Meadors grew up in Nashville, Tennessee and began playing basketball at a young age. shooting at a backboard mounted against a willow tree. According to Meadors, she decided in seventh grade to become a basketball coach. After graduating from Hillsboro High School, she attended Middle Tennessee State University not far from Nashville. She graduated with a B. S. in Physical Education in 1965 and with an M. S. in Physiology of Exercise in 1966.
College coaching.
Meadors was allowed by MTSU to begin coaching women's sports, and coached basketball at MTSU before it was a varsity sport and before Title IX was passed. In 1970, women's basketball became a varsity sport. She would coach twenty seasons at Tennessee Tech, finishing with a 363-138 (.724) lifetime record. Meadors would win six consecutive Tennessee state championships, four Ohio Valley Conference championships and two Metro Conference championships.
Looking for opportunities on a larger stage, she would coach at Florida State University from 1986 to 1996 where she led the Seminoles to two NCAA tournament appearances and the 1991 Metro Conference Championship. She left Florida State after the 1995-96 season to take over coaching duties of the Charlotte Sting. 
Meadors also served as an assistant coach at the University of Pittsburgh from 2003 to 2005.
Professional coaching.
In 1997, Meadors was hired as the head coach and general manager of the Charlotte Sting. It was the first year of the WNBA's existence, and she led the Sting to a 15-13 record, and a spot in the playoffs. In 1998, the Sting finished 18-12, and again were in the WNBA playoffs. However, during a 5-7 start in 1999, Meadors was fired after an 82-56 loss to the Cleveland Rockers.
Between coaching jobs, Meadors would become director of scouting for the Miami Sol in 1999, before the team began play in 2000. She would keep the job until the team folded in 2002. Meadors would then be hired as an assistant coach for the Pittsburgh University women's basketball team and coach there between 2003 and 2005.
In April 2005, Meadors was hired as an assistant coach by former Washington Mystics head coach Michael Adams. Adams resigned from the Mystics in the same month to join the coaching staff at the University of Maryland, and new Mystics head coach Richie Adubato kept Meadors on the coaching staff. Meadors would remain with the Mystics during Adubato's stint with the Mystics, and would finish 2007 with Tree Rollins as head coach. (The Mystics would go 50-52 while Meadors was on the coaching staff.) 
Atlanta Dream.
On November 27, 2007, Marynell Meadors was hired by owner Ron Terwilliger to become the coach of the new, Atlanta Dream WNBA franchise in Atlanta. Meadors presented detailed plans for the new franchise in an interview, and had a master list of WNBA players and college players, with notations as to which players might be protected and which college players might be worth acquiring. "I wouldn't give them the list until they hired me," said Meadors. 
With the new team forced to acquire much of its talent from an expansion draft, and with key players being injured or not signing, the Dream endured an 0-17 start to the season and only won four games during their inaugural season.
The next year, the Dream went 18-16, finishing second in the Eastern Conference, and making the playoffs. This tied for the largest win turnaround in WNBA history of 14 game win total from the previous year (Detroit Shock 9 wins in 2002; 25 wins in 2003). 
As general manager, Meadors was responsible for convincing veteran Chamique Holdsclaw to return from retirement, drafting rookies Angel McCoughtry (forward) from Louisville and Shalee Lehning (guard) from Kansas State, and getting Michelle Snow and Sancho Little in the supplemental draft from the folding of the Houston Comets. 
Meadors was named WNBA Coach of the Year receiving 30 votes, finishing ahead of Lin Dunn of the Indiana Fever who received 6 votes.
In 2010, the Dream went 19-15, finishing fourth in the Eastern Conference, and making the playoffs despite new ownership. Likewise, they lost Snow and Holdsclaw to the San Antonio Silver Stars. In the playoffs, the swept through No. 1 seed Washington and No. 2 seed New York to advance to the WNBA Finals for the first time in their history. Despite the odds, they played three close games with the Seattle Storm which featured Swin Cash, Sue Bird, and Finals MVP Lauren Jackson. 
The next year, the Dream went 20-14, finishing third in the Eastern Conference, and making the playoffs despite another ownership change. They added Lindsay Harding from a trade with the Washington Mystics as well as adding players in Courtney Paris and Sandora Irvin. Angel McCoughtry made her first All-Star debut with an outstanding season as well as contributions from Sancho Lyttle, Iziane Castro-Marques and Erika DeSouza. In the playoffs, the swept through No. 2 seed Connecticut and beat No. 1 seed Indiana 2-1 to advance to the WNBA Finals despite losing star player Erika DeSouza to the Brazilian team. In the Finals the Dream were swept again this time by the Minnesota Lynx with MVP Seimone Augustus taking stage. Still, the Dream are the only pro-basketball team in Atlanta to make it to a championship final.
In 2012, with the Dream at 12-12 and some unstated issues related to Angel McCoughtry, Meadors was fired on August 27, 2012.
USA Basketball.
Meadors was selected as the assistant coach of the team representing the USA in 1992 at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team started out with an eight point win over Japan, then won their next five with double-digit margins. In their game against Australia, they trailed at halftime, but came back to win by ten points. In their next-to-last game, the USA faced South Korea, who gave the USA the toughest challenge yet, but the USA prevailed 91–84. The final game, for the gold medal, was a rematch against Australia. The score was tied late in the first half, but the USA team finished the half with seven straight point, taking a lead they would not give up. The USA completed the competition with an 8–0 record and won the gold medal. Lisa Leslie, at age 19 was playing in her first Jones cup competition. She was the leading scorer and rebounder on the USA team.
Meadors moved up from assistant to head coach of the team representing the USA in 1993 at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The team did not start well, they lost the opening game to Japan, and followed that with a three point loss to Republic of China - Cathay Life. The USA went on to win the next five contests, including a close 74–72 win against Russia, which propelled them to a medal context. That game was a rematch against Russia, and again the results were close. The USA team won 71–69 to win the bronze medal.
Meadors was named assistant coach of the USA National team in preparation for competition in the 2010 World Championships and 2012 Olympics. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win their first game against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Swin Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Lindsay Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia—the USA jumped out to a 24 point lead, but the Australian team cut the lead back to single digits late in the game. The USA prevailed 83–75. The USA won their next two games by over thirty points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The USA team had only a five point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer, and went on to win the championship and gold medal.

Kilo Class (novel)

Kilo Class is a 1998 novel by Patrick Robinson. It features characters found in his earlier novel, "Nimitz Class", including Admiral Arnold Morgan.
The novel concerns an attempt by the People's Republic of China to obtain a fleet of Kilo class submarines from Russia, and a series of covert operations carried out by the United States Navy using a Los Angeles class submarine and Navy SEALs in order to prevent the Chinese from receiving the new boats. The submarines are wanted by China because their ability to operate silently at low speed would make it possible to dominate the Taiwanese Strait even against US Naval opposition. The novel is set in the USA, Russia, China, Taiwan and the Southern Ocean Kerguelen Islands.

A27 motorway (Netherlands)

The A27 motorway is a motorway in the Netherlands. It is approximately 109 kilometers in length.
The A27 is located in the Dutch provinces North Brabant, South Holland, Utrecht, North Holland, and Flevoland. It connects the city of Breda with the Almere. On its way, it passes the cities of Gorinchem, Utrecht and Hilversum.
The northernmost section, connecting the town of Huizen with Almere, has been opened in 1999.
'Shared section' with A58 motorway.
Although not officially a part of the "Rijksweg 27", the section of the A58 motorway between interchanges Galder and Sint-Annabosch is also being referred to as A27, next to the road's official reference number A58.
Technically this situation is incorrect, since the A27's official start is only at interchange Sint-Annabosch. However, the reference A27 has probably been added to the road signs to help traffic coming from Antwerp in finding their way from the A16 / E19 towards the A27.
European routes.
No major European routes follow the A27 motorway. The only one to follow it, is the E311 road between interchange Sint-Annabosch near Breda and interchange Lunetten near Utrecht. This section of the A27 immediately comprises the entire E311 road, since it does not follow any other roads.
Besides, the 'shared section' with the A58 is part of the European route E312.

Rehabilitation Through the Arts

Rehabilitation Through The Arts (RTA) was founded by Katherine Vockins in 1996 in Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, New York and now operates in five men's and women's, maximum and medium security New York State prisons: Sing Sing, Bedford Hills, Woodbourne, Green Haven and Fishkill. RTA is the lead program of Prison Communities International, a registered tax-exempt non-profit organization. 
Background.
RTA began in Sing Sing with a group of men who wanted help writing and presenting a play, and has since expanded to include dance, movement, visual arts, voice, music, literature and creative writing.
Mission.
RTA uses creative arts to build skills in communication, leadership, problem-solving, conflict resolution and respect for self and others. These life skills help prisoners reconnect with family, pursue education and re-enter community life on release.
The Program.
RTA runs innovative creative arts workshops in various aspects of theatre - improvisation, playwriting, devised, physical and technical theatre, Shakespeare studies - along with dance, movement, visual arts, voice, music and creative writing. Inmates perform in workshop and full scale productions of both original and published works. RTA also operates a successful modern dance program for men - the only program of its kind nation- (and perhaps world) wide.
Through creative arts, prisoners develop their ability to communicate, collaborate, set goals, express themselves and imagine alternate scenarios. Even in the harsh environment of prison, trust and community can build. Prisoners undergo a profound transformation; on release, many RTA alumni express remorse for their crimes by working in gang prevention, substance abuse and educational programs that help others make better choices in life.
Two research studies have clearly demonstrated the positive effects of the RTA program. John Jay College of Criminal Justice's 2003 study with the NYS Department of Correctional Services showed that RTA participants had fewer infractions and spent fewer days in keeplock than a control group. A 2010 study conducted by SUNY Purchase and the NYS Department of Correctional Services concluded that RTA participants complete the GED earlier in their incarceration, more RTA participants complete educational programs beyond the GED, and that after joining RTA, participants spent an almost three-fold increase in time enrolled in post-GED courses than those who did not participate. 
RTA invites over 250 community guests to its full scale productions in Sing Sing Correctional Facility each year. These are extraordinary opportunities for the public to peak behind prison walls; they are amazed at the intelligence, talent and humanity they find there. 
RTA's classes and productions are facilitied by over 30 volunteers who fan out to remote prisons across three state counties. These volunteers are professional artists and experienced teachers - most have advanced degrees and many teach in prestigious academic institutions such as NYU's graduate program in Educational Theatre, Bard College and Wesleyan University.
Theatrical Productions.
The following plays were produced as a part of Rehabilitation Through The Arts at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Ossining, NY:
Superior Donuts

Benefits and Events.
RTA held its first New York City Benefit performance "From Sing Sing to Broadway – An Evening Without Walls" in June 2006 at Playwrights Horizons Theatre, with special guest performance by Charles Dutton.
RTA's November 2010 benefit "The Inside Story", directed by Connie Grappo, featured Broadway actors Lee Wilkoff and Anne Twomey, performances by RTA alumni and an exciting auction of artwork created by RTA participants behind prison walls.
Board Members.
Board members of Prison Community International are: Katherine Vockins; Suzanne Kessler; William Hanauer; Robin Melen; Richard Waksman; Hans Hallundbaek; Jens Schott Knudsen; Raji Mangat; Mark Wallace; Sean Dino Johnson and Jabbar Collins.

<doc id="19075363" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19075363" title="Lost circulation">
Lost circulation

In oil or gas well drilling, lost circulation occurs when drilling fluid, known commonly as "mud", flows into one or more geological formations instead of returning up the annulus.
Lost circulation can be a serious problem during the drilling of an oil well or gas well. 
Consequences.
The consequences of lost circulation can be as little as the loss of a few dollars of drilling fluid, or as disastrous as a blowout and loss of life, so close monitoring of tanks, pits, and flow from the well, to quickly assess and control lost circulation, is taught and practiced. If the amount of fluid in the wellbore drops due to lost circulation (or any other reason), hydrostatic pressure is reduced, which can allow a gas or fluid which is under a higher pressure than the reduced hydrostatic pressure to flow into the wellbore.
Another consequence of lost circulation is "dry drilling". Dry drilling occurs when fluid is completely lost from the well bore without actual drilling coming to a stop. The effects of dry drilling range from as minor as destroying a bit to as serious as major damage to the wellbore requiring a new well to be drilled. Dry drilling can also cause severe damage to the drill string, including snapping the pipe, and the drilling rig itself.
Categories.
Lost circulation falls into two main categories:
Total losses may also occur, where the return of fluids is completely lost to the surface. This may fall into either the minor or severe losses categories, depending on the amount lost and the time involved in regaining circulation.
Control.
Although preferred, stopping lost circulation completely is not always possible or required. Controlled losses allow drilling to continue while keeping the wellbore full, preventing an influx of gas or fluid into the wellbore, known as a" kick", which can lead to a blowout.
A number of options are available when lost circulation occurs, depending on the severity.
Total losses can be regained through conventional use of increased viscosity and additives, or through use of unconventional methods such as pumping of golf balls, tree branches, rags, additive sacks, and other items in conjunction with, or followed by, a high viscosity fluid. If total losses occur and circulation cannot be regained, several options are available, depending on the operational requirements and depth being drilled in relation to desired production geological zones. Continuing drilling while pumping drilling fluid is one option, though continued drilling while pumping water is less costly and more often used. Sometimes the cuttings from continued drilling will aid in reducing leaks or stop losses altogether. A third option is to cement the zone where the losses occurred, and to drill through the cement and continue drilling the well. This third option is very often the most cost effective if severe losses occur, as lost circulation sometimes cannot be controlled with other methods.
Additive considerations.
Several factors are considered in what additives are used:

John Daniel (priest)

John Daniel (born 1745; died in Paris, 3 October 1823) was an English Roman Catholic priest, and the last effective head of the English College, Douai.
Life.
He was educated first at Dame Alice's School, Fernyhalgh, and then at Douai, where he was ordained priest and made professor of philosophy (1778) and afterwards of theology. When the president, Edward Kitchen, alarmed by the French Revolution, resigned his office in 1792, Daniel was appointed president, and was soon after, with his professors and students, taken prisoner and confined first at Arras and then at Dourlens. They were taken back, 27 November 1794, to the Irish College at Douai and in February, 1795, were allowed to return to England. 
Though it has been stated that Daniel was then appointed president of the college at Crook Hall (since removed to Ushaw College), this is difficult to reconcile with contemporary documents in the Westminster diocesan archives; he did not in fact take up residence at Crook Hall, but retired to Lancashire till 1802, when he went to Paris in order to recover the property of Douai College and other British establishments. After 1815 compensation amounting to half a million pounds was paid by the French Government, but the English Government confiscated this money, neither returning it to France nor allowing the English Catholics to receive it. Daniel was the last "de facto" president of Douai, though the Rev. Francis Tuite was appointed titular president, to succeed him in prosecuting the claims.
Works.
Daniel wrote an "Ecclesiastical History of the Britons and Saxons" (London, 1815, 1824).
Family.
He was the son of Edward Daniel of Durton, Lancashire, and great-nephew of the Rev. Hugh Tootell, better known as Dodd the historian.

America COMPETES Act

The America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act of 2007 or America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69) was signed by President Bush and became law on 9 August 2007. This was an Act, "To invest in innovation through research and development, and to improve the competitiveness of the United States."
On 29 May 2010, the U.S. House passed a measure to reauthorize the America COMPETES Act. On 22 July 2010, the U.S. Senate's Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation approved the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 and sent it to the Senate for a vote.
On 4 January 2011, President Obama signed into law the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358).
America COMPETES Act of 2007.
The provisions of The America COMPETES Act of 2007 covered a wide range of activities of a great number of federal agencies and offices including the Office of Science and Technology Policy (Title I), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Title II), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Title III), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Title IV), the Department of Energy (Title V), and the National Science Foundation (Title VII). In many places, the Act mandates that each agency cooperate with its partner agencies and offices, and it calls attention to the importance of high-risk, high-reward research in areas of critical national need.
General Provisions.
The America COMPETES Act of 2007 has many provisions in its 146 pages.
It created the President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness (Title I, Sec. 1006). This council appears never to have been formed. Instead, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) was formed in 2010 by President Obama to serve in its place. This committee is also known as the President's Innovation and Technology Advisory Committee.
It called for a National Science and Technology Summit (Title I, Sec. 1001) and numerous reports on the state of innovation and competitiveness in the United States (e.g., Sec. 1002, 1005, 1006, 1007, 2006, 3004, 3005, 3011, 7007, 7010, 7014, 7016, 7032) and assessments of each unit's effective support of the Act's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education agenda (e.g., Sec. 2001.f, 3011)
In several places, it called for the enhancement of research capabilities and coordination (e.g., Sec. 2003, 5006, 5011) and emphasized the importance of undergraduate research experiences as tools that promote careers in STEM fields (e.g., Sec. 2005, 7025).
The Act also sets baselines for targeted funding appropriations (e.g., Sec 3001, 5004.f, 5005, 5007, 5008, 5009, 5012, 6115, 6116, 6304, 6502, 7002) which range from overall levels of funding for an agency or targeting funding for new programs to be delivered by a given agency. Of special note is the Act's goal of doubling the annual appropriations for the National Science Foundation by the year 2011.
Education Provisions.
The Act pays considerable attention to the efforts each agency makes in the area of educating future STEM professionals, sometimes through amendments made to other Acts (e.g., Sec 5003.a, 3015, 4002, 5004), a general technique which is used in several places in the Act. In addition, the Act devotes considerable space to education and places it at the same level of prominence in the Act as the Federal agencies mentioned above (i.e., as Title VI). Title Vi, Subtitle A of the Act is titled "Teacher Assistance" and is divided into parts, each of which address separate provisions:
Title Vi, Subtitle B of the Act is titled "Mathematics". Its purpose is to enable all elementary and middle school students to reach or exceed grade-level academic achievement standards and to prepare the students to enroll in and pass algebra; to provide summer term programs in mathematics, technology, and problem-solving; and to provide targeted support for low-income and special needs middle school students and their teachers. Subtitle C of the Act is titled "Foreign Language Partnership Program". It will increase the opportunities to study critical foreign languages and the context in which the critical foreign languages are spoken; and increase the number of American students who achieve the highest level of proficiency in critical foreign languages. Subtitle D of the Act is called "Alignment of Education Programs", and it aims to coordinate learning outcomes and assessments across State and Federal stakeholders. Subtitle D of the Act, called "Mathematics and Science Partnership Bonus Grants", sets out modest (e.g., $50,000) awards to high-need schools in each state which show the greatest improvement on the State's assessment in mathematics, and another for the greatest improvement on the State's assessment in science.
Provisions for the National Science Foundation.
Title VII addresses the National Science Foundation directly. The National Science Foundations is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences, so it reasonable for both the America COMPETES Act of 2007 and this article to single out the agency.
In Sec. 6002, the Act makes specific provisions on the appropriation for the following NSF programs in FY2008 through FY2010: the Major Research Instrumentation program, the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program, the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program, the Graduate Research Fellowship program, a new the professional science master’s degree program, for Mathematics and Science Education Partnerships, the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, the Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Talent Expansion Program, and the Advanced Technological Education program. The NSF's FY2008 appropriation is set at $6.6 billion by this Act, and the appropriation grows to $8.132 billion in FY2010.
The Act mandates new proposal requirements such as a mentoring plan for all postdoctoral positions (Sec. 7008), that each institution receiving NSF funds for STEM research or education have a plan to provide training on the responsible conduct of research to undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers (Sec. 7009), and the sharing of final project reports (Sec. 7010, 7011).
It also appears that research directorates are being directed to share some of the cost of the educational work of the NSF (e.g., Section 7025).
The Act mandates that the NSF commission a report from the National Academies of Sciences about barriers to increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and to identify strategies for bringing more underrepresented minorities into the STEM workforce (Sec. 7032).
America COMPETES Act of 2010.
The House reauthorized the Act on 28 May 2010 by a vote of 262-150. On December 17, 2010, the Senate passed an amended version of H.R. 5116 by unanimous consent. Then, on December 22, the House voted 228-130 to pass the Senate's version and allow it to become law.
The America COMPETES Act of 2007 rejuvenated focus on increasing basic research investment in the physical sciences, strengthening educational opportunities in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields and developing a robust innovation infrastructure. Reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act continues a robust investment in basic research and education and preserves the essence of the original Act by increasing the investment focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics basic research an education as a national priority.
The Economic and Statistics Administration, in the Department of Commerce, created the http://www.commerce.gov/competes web site with the text of the Act, information on the innovative and competitive capacity of the U.S. and video recordings of top Commerce officials.

United States Innovation and Competitive Capacity.
Section 604 of the COMPETES Act required a study on the competitive and innovative capacity of the United States. The Economic and Statistics Administration in the Department of Commerce completed the report. The report includes
COMPETES Report.
The report was released on January 6, 2012 by Secretary of Commerce John Bryson. The report outlines the major accomplishments of the American model (pertaining to the aforementioned criteria) in the past and offers brief recommendations for ensuring future success. Here is a summary:
Chapter 1: Rising to the Challenge details the US economy’s exceptional past performance, the cause for alarm in employment, wages, innovation indexes, education attainment, and manufacturing, and the interconnectedness between innovation, competitiveness, and the assorted factors contributing to both.
Chapter 2: Keys to Innovation defines the major concepts behind innovation, competitiveness and government intervention. Chapter 2 also goes into more depth into what made the United States successful in the past. Detailed sections on how the United States created a competitive edge through widespread education, large-scale funding of public works projects, research and development and successful public –private partnerships. 
Chapter 3: Federal Support for Research and Development provides justification for increasing federal support for research and development. Research and development is highlighted throughout the report as a key item necessary for increasing the innovative and competitive capacity of the United States.
Chapter 4: Educating our Workforce highlights the positive role STEM education and jobs has in an advanced economy. The STEM workforce is expanding but American students are not gaining STEM skills at the same rate as other developing or industrialized nation. As this trend continues, the competitive edge between the US and other countries diminishes. This chapter also expounds on the role community colleges play in making higher education affordable and a viable option.
Chapter 5: Infrastructure for the 21st Century presents the notion of an information infrastructure. Alongside traditional infrastructure such as the road network, telephone lines, water and sewage this chapter states the American advanced economy must have an information infrastructure – high speed internet access, adequate spectrum allotment, cloud network etc. – that can support the increasingly wireless and technology-based economy.
Chapter 6: Revitalizing Manufacturing explores the importance of the strong manufacturing sector to the US economy. The chapter details the current state of the manufacturing sector and details the recent decline in employment, increase in productivity and the effects outsourcing and other recent conventions have had on output.
Chapter 7: The Private Sector as the Engine of Innovation provides a catalog of recommendations not included in the previous 6 chapters that will help the economy grow. Topics ranging from corporate taxes, intellectual property rights, regional clusters, and increased export initiatives.
The COMPETES report pushes for increased federal support in basic research, the redoing of the American education system and the reallocation of wireless spectrum. It also details the importance of the manufacturing sector to the American economy and the how improvements in research and development, education and information infrastructure can lead to employment and a greater competitive edge.
Innovation Advisory Board.
The innovation advisory board was a fifteen member group of business and nonprofit leaders in the fields of science, technology and innovation: Robert Atkinson, Rebecca Bagley, Jim Clements, Abby Joseph Cohen, Larry Cohen, Judy Estrin, Rebecca Henderson, Irwin Jacobs, Arthur Levinson, James Manyika, Natalia Olson-Urtecho, Kim Polese, Lucy Sanders, Julie Shimer, and Stephen Tang.

<doc id="19075439" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19075439" title="Slot-waveguide">
Slot-waveguide

A slot-waveguide is an optical waveguide that guides strongly confined light in a subwavelength-scale low refractive index region by total internal reflection.
A slot-waveguide consists of two strips or slabs of high-refractive-index (nH) materials separated by a subwavelength-scale low-refractive-index (nS) slot region and surrounded by low-refractive-index (nC) cladding materials.
Principle of operation.
The principle of operation of a slot-waveguide is based on the discontinuity of the electric field (E-field) at high-refractive-index-contrast interfaces. Maxwell’s equations state that, to satisfy the continuity of the normal component of the electric displacement field D at an interface, the corresponding E-field must undergo a discontinuity with higher amplitude in the low-refractive-index side. That is, at an interface between two regions of dielectric constants εS and εH, respectively:
where the superscript N indicates the normal components of D and E vector fields. Thus, if nS«nH, then ESN»EHN.
Given that the slot critical dimension (distance between the high-index slabs or strips) is comparable to the exponential decay length of the fundamental eigenmode of the guided-wave structure, the resulting E-field normal to the high-index-contrast interfaces is enhanced in the slot and remains high across it. The power density in the slot is much higher than that in the high-index regions. Since wave propagation is due to total internal reflection, there is no interference effect involved and the slot-structure exhibits very low wavelength sensitivity.
Invention.
The slot-waveguide was born in 2003 as an unexpected outcome of theoretical studies on metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) electro-optic modulation in high-confinement silicon photonic waveguides by Vilson Rosa de Almeida and Carlos Angulo Barrios, then a Ph.D. student and a Postdoctoral Associate, respectively, at Cornell University. Theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration of the first slot-waveguide implemented in the Si/SiO2 material system at 1.55 μm operation wavelength were reported by Cornell researchers in 2004.
Since these pioneering works, several guided-wave configurations based on the slot-waveguide concept have been proposed and demonstrated. Relevant examples are the following:
In 2005, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology proposed to use multiple slot regions in the same guided-wave structure (multi-slot waveguide) in order to increase the optical field in the low-refractive-index regions. The experimental demonstration of such multiple slot waveguide in a horizontal configuration was first published in 2007.
In 2006, the slot-waveguide approach was extended to the terahertz frequency band by researchers at RWTH Aachen University. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology also demonstrated that a slot waveguide, in combination with nonlinear electrooptic polymers, could be used to build ring modulators with exceptionally high tunability. Later this same principle enabled Baehr-Jones et al. to demonstrate a mach-zehnder modulator with an exceptionally low drive voltage of 0.25 V 
In 2007, a non-planar implementation of the slot-waveguide principle of operation was demonstrated by researchers at the University of Bath. They showed concentration of optical energy within a subwavelength-scale air hole running down the length of a photonic-crystal fiber.
Fabrication.
Planar slot-waveguides have been fabricated in different material systems such as Si/SiO2 and Si3N4/SiO2. Both vertical (slot plane is normal to the substrate plane) and horizontal (slot plane is parallel to the substrate plane) configurations have been implemented by using conventional micro- and nano-fabrication techniques. These processing tools include electron beam lithography, photolithography, chemical vapour deposition low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) or plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), thermal oxidation, reactive-ion etching and focused ion beam.
In vertical slot-waveguides, the slot and strips widths are defined by electron- or photo-lithography and dry etching techniques whereas in horizontal slot-waveguides the slot and strips thicknesses are defined by a thin-film deposition technique or thermal oxidation. Thin film deposition or oxidation provides better control of the layers dimensions and smoother interfaces between the high-index-contrast materials than lithography and dry etching techniques. This makes horizontal slot-waveguides less sensitive to scattering optical losses due to interface roughness than vertical configurations.
Fabrication of a non-planar (fiber-based) slot-waveguide configuration has also been demonstrated by means of conventional microstructured optical fiber technology.
Applications.
A slot-waveguide produces high E-field amplitude, optical power, and optical intensity in low-index materials at levels that cannot be achieved with conventional waveguides. This property allows highly efficient interaction between fields and active materials, which may lead to all-optical switching, optical amplification and optical detection on integrated photonics. Strong E-field confinement can be localized in a nanometer-scale low-index region. As firstly pointed out in, the slot waveguide can be used to greatly increase the sensitivity of compact optical sensing devices or to enhance the efficiency of near-field optics probes.
At Terahertz frequencies, slot waveguide based splitter has been designed which allows for low loss propagation of Terahertz waves. The device acts as a splitter through which maximum throughput can be achieved by adjusting the arm length ratio of the input to the output side.

Île Verte (Grenoble)

L'Île Verte is a neighborhood in Grenoble, located in a bend in the Isère river. It is relatively independent from downtown. The district is one of the most heavily populated in the town, due primarily to the large apartments (three large towers, as well as an ?S-shaped apartment complex). The area is mostly residential, but the Police Headquarters (Hotel de Police) is also located here.
The Three Towers.
The landmark Residence Île Verte, popularly referred to as "the Three Towers of Grenoble," was built within a park in the Île Verte district between 1963 and 1967, on a plan by Roger Anger and Pierre Puccinelli. At a height of 98 meters (not counting the antenna), the three towers were the highest inhabited buildings in Europe when they were completed, with a total of 504 apartments spread among 28 inhabited floors, each tower containing a total of 33 stories. The towers are named Belledonne, Vercors, and Mont Blanc.
Saint Roch Cemetery.
In the Ile Verte district, Saint Roch Cemetery is not the oldest cemetery in Grenoble, but it is the first that was opened by the city and intended for all residents. It was inaugurated in 1810 and took its name from the nearby Saint Roch chapel. It is still in use, augmented in 1941 by the cemetery of the Grand Sablon at La Tronche, on the other side of the Isere river.
Some of the funerary monuments have real artistic value, among them the works of Grenoble sculptors Victor Sappey and Henri Ding.

Pakistanis in Spain

Pakistanis in Spain form one of the country's smaller migrant communities. Their numbers began to grow rapidly in the early 2000s.
Migration history.
Pakistanis began settling in Spain, mainly in the city center of Barcelona, as early as the 1970s, and most Pakistanis in Spain still reside there However, it took until November 2006 for the Pakistani government to approve plans to open a consulate there. They primarily trace their origins to the province of Punjab. Migrants largely consist of men; according to Spain's Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE), only 13% are women. There are various conflicting data regarding the size of their community. 2004 figures from Pakistan's Ministry of Labour, Manpower, and Overseas Pakistanis show just 2,000 Pakistanis in Spain, which would make them the 15th-largest Pakistani community in Europe, or just 0.2% of the total number of Pakistanis in Europe. In contrast, the INE gave a figure for the year 2009 of more than twenty-six times that, 53,691, which represented growth of 27.5% over the 2007 figure of 42,105. Finally, some media reports around 2007 and 2008 give a figure of 70,000.
Employment.
Common areas of employment among the Pakistanis in Barcelona include in agriculture, as skilled tradespersons such as mechanics, carpenters, or welders, and in construction. A small proportion are engaged in the liberal professions, mainly medicine, law, and engineering. About four-tenths also run their own businesses. Grocery stores, butchers' shops, clothing stores, mobile phone shops, and discount shops are some of the more common types of businesses. The first halal butcher's shop in Barcelona was opened in 1983 by a Pakistani businessman. About half remit money to their families in Pakistan.
Language.
Punjabi is the most common first language among Pakistanis in Spain, reported by 63.6% of one survey group in Barcelona. The national language Urdu is also widely spoken, but very few have it as their first language. In the same survey, 95.4% stated that they could speak at least some Spanish, and 54.6% could also speak English; 12.9% also claimed some knowledge of Catalan, the language spoken in Barcelona where much of the Pakistani population in Spain lives.
Religion.
Islam is by far the most common religion among Pakistanis in Spain, and serves as an important marker of community belonging. In Solé Aubia and Rodríguez Roca's 2005 study, every single one of their 280 interviewees stated that he or she was a Muslim; of them, 82.5% indicated that they continued to practise Islam properly, while 13.2% claimed that they would like to practise it properly but were prevented by various constraints, and just 2.9% did not practise the religion because they did not want to.
In Barcelona, the two mosques most frequented by Pakistanis are the Tariq ben Zyad Mosque and the Minhaj ul-Quran Mosque. The Tariq ben Zyad Mosque, on the "calle Elisabets", was founded in 1981. It is named for Tariq ibn Ziyad, the general who led the Muslim conquest of Spain beginning in 711, and belongs to the Tablighi Jamaat movement.

Inter-ethnic relations.
The presence of Pakistanis in Spain was not much noted by mainstream society until late in the year 2000. That year, the government passed amnesty laws which would enable foreigners residing in Spain illegally to regularise their status; however, as a result of being unable to meet the requirements, a group of about a hundred, among them many Pakistanis, barricaded themselves in two churches in Barcelona and declared a hunger strike, which would last from 20 January to 8 March 2001 and would attract an additional seven hundred protestors during that time. Despite a widespread knowledge of Spanish among them, most Pakistanis do not have many personal relationships with Spaniards; in Barcelona, only 28.2% stated that they knew any Spaniards personally.

MIL-PRF-38535

MIL-PRF-38535 is a United States military specification that establishes the general performance and verification requirements of single die integrated circuit device type electronics. It is a performance-based specification document defining the general requirements, as well as the quality assurance and reliability requirements, for the manufacture of microelectronic or integrated circuits used in military applications and high-reliability microcircuit application programs.
Origins and Evolution.
The specification provides the device manufacturer with the flexibility to implement best commercial practices while still providing a product that meets military performance needs. To be granted such privilege, a manufacturer must certified pursuant to the Qualified Products List (QPL) and the Qualified Manufacture List (QML) program. Developed in 1995 pursuant to DoD 4120.24M, the QPD/QML program moved defense procurement processes away from the use of strict detail specifications to a newer system based on industry practices.
Specification Overview.
MIL-PRF-38535 allows the device manufacturer the flexibility to implement best commercial practices while still providing a product that meets military performance needs.
Document Structure.
As a performance specification, the document provides the device manufacturers with an acceptable established baseline to support Government microcircuit application and logistic programs. The basic section of this specification has been structured as a performance specification, which is supplemented with detailed appendices. These appendices provide guidance to manufacturers on demonstrated successful approaches to meeting military performance needs. These appendices are included as a benchmark and are intended to impose performance requirements. For QML microcircuits the manufacturer developed a program plan that meets the performance detailed in these appendices. Appendix A is mandatory for manufacturers of device types supplied in compliance with MIL-STD-883 and forms the basis for QML classes Q and V. Appendix B is intended for space application and is required for V level devices. Appendix C is mandatory for devices requiring RHA. Appendix D is mandatory for statistical sampling, life test, and qualification procedures used with microcircuits.
RHA levels.
The specification defines some Hi dose rate TID total dose Radiation Hardness Assurance levels:

Karl Kani philosophy.
Carl Williams symbolizes the “American Dream”. Karl realized his childhood dream of combining his passion for Hip Hop music and fashion. 
When Karl started his clothing line in Los Angeles, he had a rough start. The question that had obsessed him for years “ Can I do it?” remained unanswered. He kept asking himself: “Can I do it? Can I build a fashion empire? Can I become the ‘Ralph Lauren of the streets’?” 
These questions provided the basis for his brandname, Kani, a variation on "Can I?". Karl replaced the “C” with a stylish “K” and ventured his own optimistic reply, Karl Kani.
Karl used the expanding appeal of the men’s collection to launch a woman’s line and spread his positive message to ladies as well. 
Kani Ladies.

Gorwa

Gorwa is a residential-commercial area in the Vadodara district of the Gujarat State in India. Gorwa lies on the north-western part of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) limits. The place is also referred as 'Gorva'. The place is known so due to the very famous Gorwa lake which still is the center of this region. Situated alomost on the border of the urban city limits, Gorwa lies in the middle of the famous Bhailal Amin Road in Vadodara. Gorwa boasts about a mixture of both residential and commercial sites along with numerous restaurants and medical centers and one of the biggest and the oldest vegetable market of Vadodara.
About.
Gorwa is situated in Vadodara, Gujarat, India, and its geographical coordinates are 22° 19' 0" North, 73° 10' 0" East and its original name (with diacritics) is Gorwa. 
Gorwa is connected by 2 major roadways. The first is the Bhailal Amin Marg (BA Road), connecting Gorwa to the outer city-sites of IOC and IPCL industrial areas on one side and the colonies of Alembic and Fatehgunj on the other. The second major road is the Ellora Park Road, connecting Gorwa to the famous Race-Course circle and Alkapuri, the economic hub of Vadodara, on one side and merging with the Bhailal Amin Marg on the other end.
Gorwa was originally a village and remained so until the late 1980s, when the Industrial boom in Vadodara saw a great influx of people from all around the country looking for a cheap residential accommodation. Majority of the residential areas in Gorwa are managed by the Gujarat Housing Board (GHB), a government undertaking. Few of the famous residential societies in Gorwa are Laxmikunj Society, Adarsh Duplex, Akansha Duplex, Millenium Society, Narmada Nagari, Vitthalesh Bunglows housing projects from GHB and many more. It has many medical clinics and centers spear across, but the nearest major Hospitals like the Bhailal Amin General Hospital and the Sterling-Unity Hospital are less than 10 kilometers away. Gorwa also houses the Gorwa Industrial Estate and the famous Industrial Training Institute (I.T.I). 
Gorwa is also known for its Garba-Navratri celebrations that takes place every year near the Lakshmipura substation ground. Counting by the size of the garba circle, this is one of the biggest in Vadodara City.

Schiefe Ebene

The Schiefe Ebene ( literally: 'inclined plane') is a steep railway incline on the course of the Bamberg–Hof section of the Ludwig South-North Railway in the region of Upper Franconia, in Bavaria, Germany.
Location and Construction.
The Schiefe Ebene is located in the "Landkreis" (country district) of Kulmbach, beginning east of Neuenmarkt–Wirsberg station and ending at Marktschorgast. The route is not electrified, but has been widened to two tracks. On the adjacent incline between Marktschorgast and Stammbach, the second track has been subsequently dismantled. On its way into the Fichtelgebirge mountains the ramp climbs 157.7 metres over a distance of 6.8 kilometres and therefore has an average incline of 23‰. It was built between 1844 and 1848 as part of the Ludwig South-North line and was opened on 1 November 1848. With its numerous supporting walls, cuttings and stone embankments it was technically one of the great engineering feats of its time. The cost of construction was 917,318 Gulden.
Operation.
In the era of steam, the ramp proved a real challenge for locomotives and crews. The majority of trains had to be reinforced by heavy pusher locomotives. These were stationed in the well-known locomotive depot at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg. They included famous locomotives such as the DRG Class 95 (ex-Prussian T 20) and DRG Class 96 (ex-Bavarian Gt 2x4/4), as well as DRG Classes 57 (ex-Prussian G 10) and 50.
In the early 1970s, the route was one of the last stamping grounds of the Deutsche Bundesbahn's Class 01 express train steam locomotive. From 2001 to 2004 the Schiefe Ebene was also traversed by modern ICE-TD power cars (DBAG Class 605) with tilting technology. Today the line is worked by the tilting DMUs of DB Class 612, that serve the hourly RegionalExpress lines of Hof–Würzburg and Hof–Lichtenfels as well as the "Interregio-Express" line Nürnberg-Hof-Dresden.
At the foot of the ramp in the former locomotive depot at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg station – located in Neuenmarkt – is the German Steam Locomotive Museum ("Deutsches Dampflokomotiv-Museum") or DDM. In the upper station, in the former waiting room of Marktschorgast station, there is a small museum and information centre on the history of the Schiefe Ebene. Entrance is free. 
Marktschorgast station is also the start of a railway history trail that runs along the Schiefe Ebene and recounts the history of the line on display boards. The walk ends at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg station. The trail should be walked with stout footwear and can be completed in a few hours (length 7–8 km, hilly terrain). On the road side of Marktschorgast station is an overview board of the trail; the first display board is on the road side of the former goods shed, about 20 m northeast (in the direction of Hof) next to the railway yard.
Accident in 1944.
On 27 December 1944 a military train derailed in Neuenmarkt station, after its brakes had been unable to reduce the speed of the train sufficiently coming down the Schiefe Ebene. The exact cause remains unknown; the train was operating with two locomotives (one at the head and one at the tail of the train).
One person was killed and an unknown number of people were injured. Reports of the accident are very sketchy.

Georg Schenck van Toutenburg (German - "Georg Schenk von Tautenburg") (1480, Windischeschenbach – 2 February 1540, Vollenhove) was Stadhouder of Friesland (1521-1540), succeeding Wilhelm van Roggendorf. Later he was also Stadholder of Overijssel, Drenthe and Groningen. His son Frederick was the first archbishop of Utrecht.
Georg built the Toutenburg in Vollenhove, where he had been appointed bailiff. He succeeded in pushing back the Guelders led by Christoffel, Count of Meurs. Jancko Douwama came into conflict with Schenck, but lost. Schenck captured Dokkum (see J. of Golstein), and ultimately Sloten and Lemmer. He took the war out of Friesland, fighting Charles, Duke of Guelders in the Guelderian Wars, becoming stadholder of Overijssel, defeating the Anabaptists at Bloemkamp, and also capturing Groningen and Drenthe (1536) after the Battle of Heiligerlee, where he also became stadholder. Friesland's current administrative structures owe much to him. Under his administration the Protestants gained power, despite strict bans.

German–Kosovan relations are foreign relations between Germany and the Kosovo. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and Germany recognised it on 20 February 2008. Germany has an embassy in Pristina since 27 February 2008. Kosovo has an embassy in Berlin and consulates in Frankfurt and Stuttgart.
Germany is the second-largest donor to Kosovo behind the US.
BND affair.
On 19 November 2008 three agents of the Bundesnachrichtendienst were arrested in Kosovo and accused of involvement in a bomb attack five days earlier. The German media speculated that this arrest was meant as some kind of punishment for the BND, which in 2005 certified that Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi was involved in the Kosovar-Albanian mafia network. Even though the Kosovo police claimed to have video evidence proving the involvement of the three agents (which was never shown to the public), they were released on November 28, 2008. An unknown group called Army of the Republic of Kosovo (ARK) claimed responsibility for the bomb attack.
Military.
Germany participated in the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which resulted in a UN administration of Kosovo and then to eventual independence. Germany currently has 2,350 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO led Kosovo Force. Originally there was 8,500 German troops in KFOR. Klaus Reinhardt was the 2nd KFOR Commander from 8 October 1999 - 18 April 2000. Holger Kammerhoff was the 8th KFOR Commander from 3 October 2003 - 1 September 2004. Also Roland Kather was the 11th KFOR Commander from 1 September 2006 - 31 August 2007.
Germany sent 600 Soldiers to serve as Peacekeepers in EULEX; an EU Police, Civilian and Law Mission in Kosovo.

Christian Science Society (Nanaimo)

Christian Science Society, also called the Christian Science Society Building, is an historic single storey style Christian Science church edifice located at 20 Chapel Street in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada. It was built between 1900 and 1910 as a single-family house and was known as the McDonald Property. In 1932 it was converted to church use by being placed on a concrete foundation and having its exterior stuccoed while the interior was gutted and remodeled for its new use. Citing the building as a "good example of early adaptive re-use" and '"very good example of Classical Period Revival architecture", albeit "a very modest rendition of the style", the city designated it a local heritage site on October 7, 2002.
Christian Science Society is still an active congregation listed in the Christian Science Journal.

Integration using parametric derivatives

In mathematics, integration by parametric derivatives is a method of integrating certain functions.
For example, suppose we want to find the integral
Since this is a product of two functions that are simple to integrate separately, repeated integration by parts is certainly one way to evaluate it. However, we may also evaluate this by starting with a simpler integral and an added parameter, which in this case is "t" = 3:
This converges only for "t" > 0, which is true of the desired integral. Now that we know
we can differentiate both sides twice with respect to "t" (not "x") in order to add the factor of "x"2 in the original integral.
This is the same form as the desired integral, where "t" = 3. Substituting that into the above equation gives the value:

Construction.
"LT 535" was a Large Tug (LT), Design 377-A, 505 gross ton, vessel built as hull #331 by Levingston Shipbuilding of Orange, Texas for the U.S. Army Transportation Corps during 1943-1944. She was delivered to the Army April 26, 1944 and placed in service as the U.S. Army "LT-535". 
Service career.
"LT-535" had been in service with the U.S. Army from 1945 to 1984 when she was acquired and placed in service with the U.S. Navy in 1985, performing her duties with the Navy until finally struck at an unknown date and disposed of.

Integration using Euler's formula

In integral calculus, complex numbers and Euler's formula may be used to evaluate integrals involving trigonometric functions. Using Euler's formula, any trigonometric function may be written in terms of "e""ix" and "e"−"ix", and then integrated. This technique is often simpler and faster than using trigonometric identities or integration by parts, and is sufficiently powerful to integrate any rational expression involving trigonometric functions.
Euler's formula.
Euler's formula states that
Substituting −"x" for "x" gives the equation
These two equations can be solved for the sine and cosine:
Simple example.
Consider the integral
The standard approach to this integral is to use a half-angle formula to simplify the integrand. We shall use Euler's identity instead:
At this point, it would be possible to change back to real numbers using the formula "e"2"ix" + "e"−2"ix" = 2 cos 2"x". Alternatively, we can integrate the complex exponentials and not change back to trigonometric functions until the end:
Second example.
Consider the integral
This integral would be extremely tedious to solve using trigonometric identities, but using Euler's identity makes it relatively painless:
At this point we can either integrate directly, or we can first change the integrand to cos 6"x" - 2 cos 4"x" + cos 2"x" and continue from there.
Either method gives
Using real parts.
In addition to Euler's identity, it can be helpful to make judicious use of the real parts of complex expressions. For example, consider the integral
Since cos "x" is the real part of "e""ix", we know that
The integral on the right is easy to evaluate:
Thus:
Fractions.
In general, this technique may be used to evaluate any fractions involving trigonometric functions. For example, consider the integral
Using Euler's identity, this integral becomes
If we now make the substitution "u" = "e""ix", the result is the integral of a rational function:
Any rational function is integrable (using, for example, partial fractions), and therefore any fraction involving trigonometric functions may be integrated as well.

The British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) is a national facility for looking after and distributing data about the marine environment. BODC deal with a range of physical, chemical and biological data, which help scientists provide answers to both local questions (such as the likelihood of coastal flooding) and global issues (such as the impact of climate change). BODC is the designated marine science data centre for the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). The centre provides a resource for science, education and industry, as well as the general public. BODC is hosted by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), Liverpool.
Approach and goals.
BODC's approach to marine data management involves:
History.
The origins of BODC go back to 1969 when NERC created the British Oceanographic Data Service (BODS). Located at the National Institute of Oceanography, Wormley in Surrey, its purpose was to: 
In 1975 BODS was transferred to Bidston Observatory on the Wirral, near Liverpool, as part of the newly formed Institute of Oceanographic Sciences. The following year BODS became the Marine Information and Advisory Service (MIAS)[http://www.soton.ac.uk/library/about/nol/mias.html]. Its primary activity was to manage the data collected from weather ships, oil rigs and data buoys.
The data banking component of MIAS was restructured to form BODC in April 1989. Its mission was to 'operate as a world-class data centre in support of UK marine science'. BODC pioneered a start to finish approach to marine data management. This involved:
In December 2004, BODC moved to the purpose built Joseph Proudman Building on the campus of the University of Liverpool.

Petrus Codde

Pieter Codde also known as Petrus Codde (27 November 1648 in Amsterdam – 18 December 1710 in Utrecht) was apostolic vicar of the Catholic Church's Vicariate Apostolic of Batavia, also known as the Dutch Mission, from 1688 to 1702.
Life.
Codde studied in Leuven, taught by the Oratorians, and was ordained priest in 1672. In 1688 he was named Vicar Apostolic for the nation, although the Jesuits suspected and accused him of Jansenist sympathies. He had to justify himself to Rome against these accusations in 1694 and, after being charged with them a second time, in 1697. On the second occasion he went to Rome in person, but his "apologia" did not satisfy his critics and he was finally suspended from his office in 1702 by Pope Clement XI (with his definitive discharge from the post coming in 1704, thanks to the intervention of Giovanni Battista Bussi).
Jacques Forget wrote, in the "Catholic Encyclopedia", that since the Dutch Republic was for the most part Protestant, Catholics there lived under the direction of vicars apostolic. These representatives of the pope were soon won over to the theological position of Jansenism. Johannes van Neercassel, who governed the whole church in the Netherlands from 1663 to 1686, made no secret of his intimacy with the party. Under Neercassel the country began to become the refuge of all whose obstinacy forced them to leave Kingdom of France and Spanish Netherlands as well as a number of priests, monks, and nuns who preferred exile to the acceptance of the pontifical Bulls.
Codde, who succeeded Neercassel in 1686 went further than his predecessor and refused to sign the formulary. He was summoned to Rome, defended himself so poorly that he was first forbidden to exercise his functions, and then deposed by a decree of 1704. Codde died obstinate in 1710.
Gerard Potkamp was appointed as Codde's replacement, but Potkamp and those that followed were rejected by some of the clergy, to whom the States-General lent their support. The conflict lasted a long time, during which the episcopal functions were not fulfilled. In 1723 the Chapter of Utrecht, in this case a group of seven or eight priests who assumed the name and quality in order to put an end to the situation, elected on their own authority the vicar general, Cornelius Steenhoven, as archbishop of Utrecht. This election was not canonical, and was not approved by the pope. Bishop emeritus Paul-Werner Scheele and Bishop emeritus Fritz-René Müller wrote, in the preface to the International Roman Catholic–Old Catholic Dialogue Commission's report "The Church and Ecclesial Communion", that these "differences regarding the relationship of the local church and papal primacy" were one of the "major grounds for the separation" of the churches. But the "Old Catholic churches have however never questioned the special position of the pope in the church as a whole," according to Scheele and Müller.

Eugene M O'Neill (September 10, 1850-November 26, 1926) was an Irish-born American lawyer and newspaper owner.
Biography.
O'Neill was born in Clonroche, County Wexford, Ireland, the son of Hugh O'Neill, headmaster of town school, and Kate (Navin) O'Neill. He received his primary education at the local school run by his father then went to the University of Dublin where he graduated at age 17.
After graduation O'Neill, emigrated to the United States in March, 1867 to Pittsburgh. At the time, O'Neill's brother, Daniel O'Neill, was publisher, editor, and owner of the "Pittsburgh Dispatch", and O'Neill started work on the paper as a reporter. He worked at the paper as an editorial writer until 1874, when he began practicing law. He was admitted to the bar of Allegheny County and practiced in both county and city courts for three years.
In 1875, he was elected City Councilman of Pittsburgh, the only political office he ever accepted. When his brother died on 30 January 1877, O'Neill took over management of the paper, a position he retained until again retiring from newspaper work in March 1902.
In addition to practicing law and his work in journalism, O'Neill was an active investor in real estate and industry, accumulating a fortune which at his death was estimated at $8,000,000.
Eugene married Daniel's widow, Mrs Emily Martha “Emma” (Seely) O'Neill. They had no children. The couple lived in the family home "Linden House" in Pittsburgh, located on the corner of Penn Avenue and Linden Street. O'Neill died on 26 November 1926 at St Luke's Hospital in New York City after a three month illness. The cause of death was pneumonia. He left a son, Florence O'Neill of Paris, France, and a daughter, Emily O'Neill Davies, and 3 grandchildren. After his death, he was interred at the Allegheny Cemetery.

Ljudevit Jonke

Ljudevit Jonke (Karlovac, 29 July 1907 — Zagreb, 15 March 1979) was a Croatian linguist.
Life and work.
After finishing primary school and gymnasium in Karlovac, he graduated at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Zagreb the history of Yugoslav literatures, Croatian and Old Church Slavonic language and folk history with Russian and Latin. He spent two years (1930-1932) at the Charles University in Prague. Demonstrating the affiliation to literary and historical topics, he starts to translate from Czech. From 1933 he works as a professor at the gymnasium in Sušak, and in 1940 he relocates to Zagreb, where professor Stjepan Ivšić chooses him as an assistant in 1942. He was married to Nada Marković in 1940 with whom he had a daughter Dubravka and son Mladen (1944).
Simultaneously engaging himself in the topics of Croatian and Czech studies, he receives his Ph.D. with a thesis "Dikcionar Karlovčanina Adama Patačića" (Work of JAZU #274). From autumn 1945 he teaches Czech language and literature, and from autumn 1949 modern Croatian language at the newly established department which he was a head from 1950, when he acquired the status of "docent", up until the retirement in 1973. He became a regular professor in 1960. In 1950s Jonke engages in systematic study of a completely neglected subject of problems of Croatian language from the Illyrian times to the end of 19th century ("Borbe oko književnog oblika imeničkog genitiva množine u 19. stoljeću", 1957.; "Osnovni problemi hrvatskoga književnog jezika u 19. stoljeću", 1958; "Sporovi pri odabiranju govora za zajednički književni jezik Hrvata u 19. stoljeću", 1959). He carefully examined the work of Bogoslav Šulek and Adolfo Veber Tkalčević.
He was a participant of Novi Sad agreement, styliser and the editor of "common" orthography, one of the editors of (also common) "Dictionary of Serbo-Croatian literary language", member of JAZU. As soon as the applications of Novi Sad conclusions became detrimental at the expense of Croatian language, he publishes a series of polemics with Serb linguists and writers in which he defends the right of Croatian nation to its own language and the right of that language to achieve equal social status. He edited two columns of language advices (from 1961 in "Telegram" and since 1971 in "Vjesnik"), edited the journal "Jezik" for 17 years, has been the vice-president of Matica hrvatska. In 1963 he was elected as a member of JAZU. Due to the alleged "Croat nationalism", having been denounced after signing the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language, and after the coup in Karađorđevo (1971) he was forcefully retired in 1973. Since then he has worked on the completion of JAZU dictionary. Jonke's main contribution (beside polemical and political discussions in which he had done lion's share of fight against forceful Serbification of Croatian language) is in revitalising the interest to the contributions of Zagreb philological school and its essential role in the standardisation of Croatian language - a fact whose importance was often diminished and neglected for political reasons.

Port San Antonio

Port San Antonio is a multi-purpose, facility in San Antonio, Texas, USA established to serve as an aerospace complex, international airport and industrial hub with two railroads and close access to three interstate highways. Established at the former site of Kelly Air Force Base, the facility is centrally located between the coasts of the United States and along the NASCO corridor between Canada and Mexico. Port San Antonio enjoys designation as a Foreign Trade Zone (#80-10).
Originally established in 1995 by the San Antonio City Council as the Greater Kelly Development Authority, it was re-established under its current name in 2007. Its tenants include such companies as The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin, Pratt & Whitney, CDI Technology Services, and Standard Aero. Currently in the planning stage is a Town Center project at the port's center which would offer office space as well as provide retail, dining and housing options.
There are more than 70 companies with facilities at Port San Antonio, including aerospace, information technology and heavy industrial customers, among others. According to a 2010 study, the 13 aerospace companies operating out of the Port were found to have accounted for $1.46 billion in annual economic activity for the region.
Transportation.
Transportation offerings for Port San Antonio include Kelly Field airport which features an adjacent runway, accessibility by the Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe class I railroads, and three interstate highways: IH-35; IH-10; and IH-37. Kelly Field's runway is operated jointly with Lackland Air Force Base. 
Markets of more than 90 million people are within two days drive of Port San Antonio. Five major seaports are accessible within a three day drive: the Ports of Houston (TX), Corpus Christi (TX), Manzanillo (Mexico), Lázaro Cárdenas (Mexico) and Veracruz (Mexico).
Kelly Field.
Port San Antonio's Kelly Field (SKF) has a 11,500-foot (3,505 m) runway which can handle all types of heavy lift aircraft. Immediately adjacent to the runway is 575 acres (232.7 hectares) of mixed use airport property. The Port's airfield has sufficient space available on the ramp areas and terminals for quick re-fueling and efficient turnarounds. The airfield is operated under a joint use agreement with Lackland Air Force Base. Both entities are located on either side of the runway, which affords the airport exceptional security.
East Kelly Railport.
Port San Antonio's East Kelly Railport sits at the center of a railway intersection which services the NASCO corridor from Mexico to Canada, as well as the East and West Coasts of the United States. The East Kelly Railport has access to two Class I railroads, Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern & Santa Fe, and is immediately adjacent to the Union Pacific's South San Antonio Classification Yard, which is the destination for most local industry traffic. This location is utilized for various shipments, including bulk industrial, products for manufacturing, and bulk retail goods. The East Kelly Railport has direct rail access to the following deep water Ports: Houston (TX); Corpus Christi (TX); Long Beach (CA); Los Angeles (CA); Lázaro Cárdenas (Mexico); Manzanillo (Mexico); Veracruz (Mexico); Tampico (Mexico); and Altamira (Mexico).
The East Kelly Railport also has direct access to the following major US cities: Dallas (TX); Kansas City (KS); Chicago (IL); and Detroit (MI).
US Customs- Federal Inspection Services (FIS).
Port San Antonio has an on-site, Federal Inspection Services (FIS) facility for international cargo and agricultural products. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency is the primary authority for assessing and collecting duties, taxes and fees on imported goods. The FIS facility opened in early 2009 and is manned by a U.S. Customs and Agricultural Inspector.
Town Center.
The Port San Antonio Town Center project is to be constructed on a plot in the middle of the facility. It is intended to provide office space to businesses and to offer dining and retail opportunities for employees of the Port's tenants. It is also intended to include residential space. The area currently hosts a 1940s office building and an area of existing bungalows used in the 1920s to house Air Force personnel. The properties will be working to incorporate the historic structures as part of Kelly Town Center.
2010 Aerospace Economic Impact Study.
In a 2010 study by the SABER Research Institute, the thirteen aerospace companies operating out of Port San Antonio were found to have produced 4,300 direct and 4,500 indirect jobs at the Port, accounting for $1.46 billion in annual economic activity. The aerospace-related direct and indirect jobs alone at Port San Antonio have an annual payroll of about $487 million. Furthermore, the Port's aerospace companies help generate $683 million in "value-added impacts," which includes investment in facilities, and $145 million in local, state and federal taxes.
The following is a list of aerospace companies operating out of Port San Antonio: Aerospace Products SE, Inc; Atlantic Aviation; AVCHEM, Inc; The Boeing Company; Boeing Services Company; Chromalloy; EG&G KDC; GexPro; Gore Design Completions; Lockheed Martin; New Breed Logistics; Pratt & Whitney; and Standard Aero.

French occupation of Santo Domingo

The French occupation of Santo Domingo started in 1795 when France came to own the whole island when by the Treaty of Basel Spain ceded Santo Domingo as a consequence of the French Revolutionary Wars. At the time, slaves led by Toussaint Louverture in Saint-Domingue were in revolt against France. In 1801 Toussaint Louverture captured Santo Domingo from the French and took control of the entire island. 
In 1802 an army sent by Napoleon under the command of Charles Leclerc, captured Toussaint Louverture and sent him to France as prisoner. His successors and yellow fever succeeded in expelling the French again from Saint-Domingue. The nation declared independence as Haiti in 1804. France went on to recover Spanish Santo Domingo. In 1808, following Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the "criollos" of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule, an event known as the Reconquista.
The first battle took place in Palo Hincado on November 7, 1808, when Gen. Juan Sánchez Ramírez, leading an army of local and Puerto Rican soldiers, attacked by surprise and a garrison of the French Army under the command of Governor Gen. Louis Ferrand, who later committed suicide. The news was heard by Gen. Dubarquier who garrisoned 2000 soldiers in Santo Domingo. The Spanish laid siege to the city on November 27, 1808, with the aid of 6 frigates from the Royal Navy, and troops under the command of General Hugh Lyle Carmichael. Santo Domingo was returned to Spanish control by 9 July 1809.

Death (personification)

The concept of Death as a sentient entity has existed in many societies since the beginning of history. In English, Death is often given the name Grim Reaper and, from the 15th century onwards, came to be shown as a skeletal figure carrying a large scythe and clothed in a black cloak with a hood. It is also given the name of the Angel of Death ("Malach HaMavet") or Devil of Death or the angel of dark and light stemming from the Bible and Talmudic lore. The Bible itself does refer to "The Angel of Death" when he reaps Egypt's firstborns although he is not connected to Satan. There is also a reference to "Abaddon" (The Destroyer), an Angel who is known as the "The Angel of the Abyss". In Talmudic lore, he is characterized as archangel Samael.
In some cases, the Grim Reaper can actually cause the victim's death, leading to tales that he can be bribed, tricked, or outwitted in order to retain one's life, such as in the case of Sisyphus. Other beliefs hold that the Spectre of Death is only a psychopomp, serving to sever the last ties between the soul and the body and to guide the deceased to the next world without having any control over the fact of the victim's death. In many languages (including English), Death is personified in male form, while in others, it is perceived as a female character (for instance, in Slavic and Romance languages).
Indo-European folklore/mythology.
Hellenic.
Ancient Greece found Death to be inevitable, and, therefore, he is not represented as purely evil. He is often portrayed as a bearded and winged man, but has also been portrayed as a young boy. Death, or Thanatos, is the counterpart of life, death being represented as male, and life as female. He is the twin brother of Hypnos, the god of sleep. He is typically shown with his brother and is represented as being just and gentle. His job is to escort the dead to the underworld, Hades. He then hands the dead over to Charon, who mans the boat that carries them over the river Styx, which separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. It was believed that if the ferryman did not receive some sort of payment, the soul would not be delivered to the underworld and would be left by the riverside for a hundred years. Thanatos' sisters, the Keres, were the spirits of violent death. They were associated with deaths from battle, disease, accident, and murder. The sisters were portrayed as evil, often feeding on the blood of the body after the soul had been escorted to Hades. They had fangs and talons, and would be dressed in bloody garments.
Celtic.
Breton folklore shows us a spectral figure portending death, the Ankou. Usually, the Ankou is the spirit of the last person that died within the community and appears as a tall, haggard figure with a wide hat and long white hair or a skeleton with a revolving head who sees everyone, everywhere. The Ankou drives a deathly wagon or cart with a creaking axle. The cart or wagon is piled high with corpses and a stop at a cabin means instant death for those inside.
In Ireland was a creature known as a dullahan, whose head would be tucked under his or her arm (dullahans were not one, but an entire species), and the head was said to have large eyes and a smile that could reach the head's ears. The dullahan would ride a black horse or a carriage pulled by black horses, and stop at the house of someone about to die, and call their name, and immediately the person dies. The dullahan did not like being watched, and it was believed that if a dullahan knows someone's watching them, they'll lash their eyes with their whip, which was made from a spine, or they would toss a basin of blood on the person, which was a sign that the person was next to die.
Scottish folklore believe a black or dark green dog known as a Cù Sìth took the soul of a dying person to the afterlife. Cù Sìth means Fairy Dog in Scottish Gaidhlig.
Poland.
In Poland, Death, or "Śmierć", has an appearance similar to the traditional Grim Reaper, but instead of a black robe, Death has a white robe. Also, due to grammar, Death is a female (the word "śmierć" is of feminine gender), mostly seen as an old skeletal woman, as depicted in 15th century dialogue ""Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią"" (Latin: ""Dialogus inter Mortem et Magistrum Polikarpum"").
Scandinavia.
In Scandinavia, In Norse mythology death was personified in the shape of Hel, the goddess of death and ruler over the realm of the same name, where she received a portion of the dead. 
In the times of the Black Plague death would often be depicted as an old woman known by the name of Pesta, meaning "plague hag". She wore a black hood. She would go into a town carrying either a rake or a broom. If she brought the rake, some people would survive the plague; if she brought the broom, however, everyone would die.
Later, Scandinavians adopted the classic Grim Reaper with a scythe and black robe.
Baltic.
Lithuanians named Death "Giltinė", deriving from word "gelti" ("to sting"). Giltinė was viewed as an old, ugly woman with a long blue nose and a deadly poisonous tongue. The legend tells that Giltinė was young, pretty and communicative until she was trapped in a coffin for seven years. The goddess of death was a sister of the goddess of life and destiny, Laima, symbolizing the relationship between beginning and end.
Lithuanians later adopted the classic Grim Reaper with a scythe and black robe.
Hindu Scriptures.
The Sanskrit word for death is Mrtyu (cognate with Latin "mors" and Polish "Śmierć"), which is often personified in Dharmic religions. In Hindu scriptures, the lord of death is called Yama, or Yamaraja (literally "the lord of death"). Yamaraja rides a black buffalo and carries a rope lasso to carry the soul back to his home, called Naraka, pathalloka or Yamaloka. There are many forms of reapers, although some say there is only one who disguises himself as a small child. His agents, the Yamadutas, carry souls back to Yamalok. There, all the accounts of a person's good and bad deeds are stored and maintained by Chitragupta. The balance of these deeds allows Yama to decide where the soul has to reside in its next life, following the theory of reincarnation.
Yama is also mentioned in the Mahabharata as a great philosopher and devotee of the Supreme Brahman.
Yama is also known as Dharmaraja, or king of Dharma or justice. One interpretation is that justice is served equally to all whether they are alive or dead, based on their karma or fate. This is further strengthened by the idea that Yudhisthira, the eldest of the pandavas and considered as the personification of justice, was born due to Kunti's prayers to Yama.
Buddhist scriptures also mention Yama or Yamaraj, much in the similar way.
East Asian folklore / mythology.
In Chinese mythology, Yanluo (), is the god of death and the ruler of Di Yu (Jp. 地獄 Jigoku, Ko. 지옥 Jiok, "hell" or the underworld). The deity originated from Yama in Hinduism and was adopted into the Chinese pantheon and eventually spread to Japan as Enma-Daioh () and Korea as Great King Yŏmna (염라대왕). He is normally depicted wearing a Chinese judge's cap and traditional Chinese robes in both Chinese and Japanese depictions.
In Korean mythology, the equivalent of the Grim Reaper is the Netherworld Emissary (저승사자). He is depicted as a stern and ruthless bureaucrat in service of Great King Yŏmna (염라대왕), who escorts all—good or evil—from the land of the living to the netherworld when the time comes.
In Japanese mythology and in the Kojiki, after giving birth to the fire god Hinokagutsuchi, the goddess Izanami dies from wounds from his fire and enters the perpetual night realm called Yomi-no-kuni (the underworld) that the gods retire to and to which Izanagi, her husband, traveled in a failed attempt to reclaim her. He discovers his wife as not-so beautiful anymore, and, following a brief argument afterwards, she promises him she will take a thousand lives every day, signifying her position as the goddess of death.
There are also death gods called shinigami, which are closer to the Western tradition of the Grim Reaper. Shinigami (often plural) are common in modern Japanese arts and fiction and essentially absent from traditional mythology.
Latin America folklore / mythology.
Santa Muerte (Saint Death) is a sacred figure and feminine skeletal folk saint venerated primarily in Mexico and the United States in Folk Catholicism. As a figure made holy by popular belief, the saint of death developed through syncretism between Mesoamerican indigenous and Spanish Catholic beliefs and practices. Since the pre-Columbian era Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death, which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the syncretic Day of the Dead. Elements of that celebration include the use of skeletons to remind people of their mortality. It is more commonly known as La Catrina.
San La Muerte (Saint Death) is a skeletal folk saint that is venerated in Paraguay, the Northeast of Argentina and southern Brazil. As the result of internal migration in Argentina since the 1960s the veneration of San La Muerte has been extended to Greater Buenos Aires and the national prison system as well. Saint Death is depicted as a male skeleton figure usually holding a scythe. Although the Catholic Church in Mexico has attacked the devotion of Saint Death as a tradition that mixes paganism with Christianity and is contrary to the Christian belief of Christ defeating death, many devotees consider the veneration of San La Muerte as being part of their Catholic faith. The rituals connected to and powers ascribed to San La Muerte are very similar to Santa Muerte.
In the Brazilian religion Umbanda, the orixá Omolu personifies sickness and death, and also the cure. The image of the death is also associated with Exu, lord of the crossroads, who rules the midnight and the cemeteries.
In Aztec mythology, Mictecacihuatl is Queen of Mictlan, the underworld, ruling over the afterlife with Mictlantecuhtli, another deity who is designated as her husband. Her role is to keep watch over the bones of the dead. She presided over the ancient festivals of the dead, which evolved from Aztec traditions into the modern Day of the Dead after synthesis with Spanish cultural traditions. She is said now to preside over the contemporary festival as well. Mictecacihuatl is known as the "Lady of the Dead", since it is believed that she was born, then sacrificed as an infant. Mictecacihuatl was represented with a defleshed body and with jaw agape to swallow the stars during the day.
In Abrahamic religions.
The "Angel of the Lord" smites 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp (II Kings 19:35). When the Angel of Death passes through to smite the Egyptian first-born, God prevents "the destroyer" ("shâchath") from entering houses with blood on the lintel and side posts (Exodus 12:23). The "destroying angel" ("") rages among the people in Jerusalem (II Sam. 24:16). In I Chronicles 21:15 the "angel of the Lord" is seen by King David standing "between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem." The biblical Book of Job (33:22) uses the general term "destroyers" ("memitim"), which tradition has identified with "destroying angels" ("mal'ake Khabbalah"), and Prov. 16:14 uses the term the "angels of death" ("mal'ake ha-mavet"). Azra'il is sometimes referred as the Angel of Death as well.
Memitim.
The memitim are a type of angel from biblical lore associated with the mediation over the lives of the dying. The name is derived from the Hebrew word "mĕmītǐm" and refers to angels that brought about the destruction of those whom the guardian angels no longer protected. While there may be some debate among religious scholars regarding the exact nature of the memitim, it is generally accepted that, as described in the Book of Job 33:22, they are killers of some sort.
In Judaism.
Form and functions.
According to the Midrash, the Angel of Death was created by God on the first day. His dwelling is in heaven, whence he reaches earth in eight flights, whereas Pestilence reaches it in one. He has twelve wings. "Over all people have I surrendered thee the power," said God to the Angel of Death, "only not over this one which has received freedom from death through the Law." It is said of the Angel of Death that he is full of eyes. In the hour of death, he stands at the head of the departing one with a drawn sword, to which clings a drop of gall. As soon as the dying man sees Death, he is seized with a convulsion and opens his mouth, whereupon Death throws the drop into it. This drop causes his death; he turns putrid, and his face becomes yellow. The expression "the taste of death" originated in the idea that death was caused by a drop of gall.
The soul escapes through the mouth, or, as is stated in another place, through the throat; therefore, the Angel of Death stands at the head of the patient (Adolf Jellinek, l.c. ii. 94, Midr. Teh. to Ps. xi.). When the soul forsakes the body, its voice goes from one end of the world to the other, but is not heard (Gen. R. vi. 7; Ex. R. v. 9; xxxiv.). The drawn sword of the Angel of Death, mentioned by the Chronicler (I. Chron. 21:15; comp. Job 15:22; Enoch 62:11), indicates that the Angel of Death was figured as a warrior who kills off the children of men. "Man, on the day of his death, falls down before the Angel of Death like a beast before the slaughterer" (Grünhut, "", v. 102a). R. Samuel's father (c. 200) said: "The Angel of Death said to me, 'Only for the sake of the honor of mankind do I not tear off their necks as is done to slaughtered beasts'" ('Ab. Zarah 20b). In later representations, the knife sometimes replaces the sword, and reference is also made to the cord of the Angel of Death, which indicates death by throttling. Moses says to God: "I fear the cord of the Angel of Death" (Grünhut, l.c. v. 103a et seq.). Of the four Jewish methods of execution, three are named in connection with the Angel of Death: Burning (by pouring hot lead down the victim's throat), slaughtering (by beheading), and throttling. The Angel of Death administers the particular punishment that God has ordained for the commission of sin.
A peculiar mantle ("idra"-according to Levy, "Neuhebr. Wörterb." i. 32, a sword) belongs to the equipment of the Angel of Death (Eccl. R. iv. 7). The Angel of Death takes on the particular form which will best serve his purpose; e.g., he appears to a scholar in the form of a beggar imploring pity (The beggar should receive Tzedakah.)( 28a). "When pestilence rages in the town, walk not in the middle of the street, because the Angel of Death pestilence strides there; if peace reigns in the town, walk not on the edges of the road. When pestilence rages in the town, go not alone to the synagogue, because there the Angel of Death stores his tools. If the dogs howl, the Angel of Death has entered the city; if they make sport, the prophet Elijah has come" ( 60b). The "destroyer" ("") in the daily prayer is the Angel of Death (Ber. 16b). Midr. Ma'ase Torah (compare Jellinek, "B. H." ii. 98) says: "There are six Angels of Death: Gabriel over kings; over youths; Mashbir over animals; over children; and over man and beast."
Scholars and the Angel of Death.
Talmud teachers of the 4th century associate quite familiarly with him. When he appeared to one on the street, the teacher reproached him with rushing upon him as upon a beast, whereupon the angel called upon him at his house. To another, he granted a respite of thirty days, that he might put his knowledge in order before entering the next world. To a third, he had no access, because he could not interrupt the study of the Talmud. To a fourth, he showed a rod of fire, whereby he is recognized as the Angel of Death (M. K. 28a). He often entered the house of Bibi and conversed with him ( 4b). Often, he resorts to strategy in order to interrupt and seize his victim (B. M. 86a; Mak. 10a).
The death of Joshua ben Levi in particular is surrounded with a web of fable. When the time came for him to die and the Angel of Death appeared to him, he demanded to be shown his place in paradise. When the angel had consented to this, he demanded the angel's knife, that the angel might not frighten him by the way. This request also was granted him, and Joshua sprang with the knife over the wall of paradise; the angel, who is not allowed to enter paradise, caught hold of the end of his garment. Joshua swore that he would not come out, and God declared that he should not leave paradise unless he was absolved from his oath; if not absolved, he was to remain. The Angel of Death then demanded back his knife, but Joshua refused. At this point, a heavenly voice ("") rang out: "Give him back the knife, because the children of men have need of it" (Ket. 77b; Jellinek, l.c. ii. 48-51; Bacher, l.c. i. 192 et seq.).
Rabbinic views.
The Rabbis found the Angel of Death mentioned in Psalm 134:45 (it should be noted that Psalms 134 only has 3 verses in all English translations)(A. V. 48), where the Targum translates: "There is no man who lives and, seeing the Angel of Death, can deliver his soul from his hand." Eccl. 8:4 is thus explained in Midrash Rabbah to the passage: "One may not escape the Angel of Death, nor say to him, 'Wait until I put my affairs in order,' or 'There is my son, my slave: take him in my stead.'" Where the Angel of Death appears, there is no remedy (Talmud, Ned. 49a; Hul. 7b). If one who has sinned has confessed his fault, the Angel of Death may not touch him (Midrash Tanhuma, ed. Buber, 139). God protects from the Angel of Death (Midrash Genesis Rabbah lxviii.).
By acts of benevolence, the anger of the Angel of Death is overcome; when one fails to perform such acts the Angel of Death will make his appearance (, viii.). The Angel of Death receives his order from God (Ber. 62b). As soon as he has received permission to destroy, however, he makes no distinction between good and bad ( 60a). In the city of Luz. the Angel of Death has no power, and, when the aged inhabitants are ready to die, they go outside the city ( 46b; compare Sanh. 97a). A legend to the same effect existed in Ireland in the Middle Ages ("Jew. Quart. Rev." vi. 336).
In Catholicism.
In Roman Catholicism, the archangel Michael is viewed as the good Angel of Death (as opposed to Samael, the controversial Angel of Death), carrying the souls of the deceased to Heaven (cf. his invocation in the traditional offertory of the requiem Mass). A few people in Mexico regard the Angel of Death as a saint, known as Santa Muerte, and as San La Muerte in Argentina and Paraguay, but this local cult is not acknowledged by the Catholic Church.
In Islam.
In Islam, Death is represented by Azrael, Malak al-Mawt (Angel of Death), one of God's archangels. When Azrael comes to take the soul of a human he can appear in a good looking form for a good person or a terrifying form for an evil person.

Since 1897 Dimitar Rizov worked as a diplomat. He was a Bulgarian ambassador in Skopje (1897–1899), diplomatic agent in Cetinje (1903–1905), Belgrade (1905–1907), plenipotentiary minister in Rome (1908–1915), and Berlin (1915–1918). In 1917 in Berlin, together with his brother, Nikola Rizov (also diplomat and publicist), he published the Atlas "Bulgarians in their historical, ethnographic, and political frontiers, Berlin 1917", containing 40 maps and explanatory texts in German, English, French, and Bulgarian. Of special significance are the maps, drawn by the leading Bulgarian scientists Prof. Anastas Ishirkov (geography) and Prof. Vasil Zlatarski (history). The atlas contains facsimiles of maps by Pavel Jozef Šafárik, Ami Boué, Ljubomir Davidović, Lejean, F. Hahn and Zach, Mackensie and Irby, Prof. Erben, Elisée Reclus, Kiepert, Synvet, Vasil Kantschoff, and others.
Rizov often changed his political positions for which he was known with the nickname "The Man of the Hundred Opinions". For his opposition to Kniaz Ferdinand, Rizov was sent to prison; later, however, Rizov accepted the Kniaz's regime and political aims. With respect to the Bulgarian national question, and, in particular, to the Macedonian Question, Rizov is unwavering in defending the rights of Bulgarians living outside of the Bulgarian borders.

Forking lemma

The forking lemma is any of a number of related lemmas in cryptography research. The lemma states that if an adversary (typically a probabilistic Turing machine), on inputs drawn from some distribution, produces an output that has some property with non-negligible probability, then with non-negligible probability, if the adversary is re-run on new inputs but with the same random tape, its second output will also have the property.
This concept was first used by David Pointcheval and Jacques Stern in "Security proofs for signature schemes," published in the proceedings of Eurocrypt 1996. In their paper, the forking lemma is specified in terms of an adversary that attacks a digital signature scheme instantiated in the random oracle model. They show that if an adversary can forge a signature with non-negligible probability, then there is a non-negligible probability that the same adversary with the same random tape can create a second forgery in an attack with a different random oracle. The forking lemma was later generalized by Mihir Bellare and Gregory Neven. The forking lemma has been used to prove the security of a variety of digital signature schemes and other random-oracle based cryptographic constructions.
Statement of the lemma.
The generalized version of the lemma is stated as follows. Let "A" be a probabilistic algorithm, with inputs ("x", "h"1, ..., "h""q"; "r") that outputs a pair ("J", "y"), where "r" refers to the random tape of "A" (that is, the random choices A will make). Suppose further that "IG" is a probability distribution from which "x" is drawn, and that "H" is a set of size "h" from which each of the "hi" values are drawn according to the uniform distribution. Let acc be the probability that on inputs distributed as described, the "J" output by "A" is greater than or equal to 1.
We can then define a "forking algorithm" "FA" that proceeds as follows, on input "x":
Let frk be the probability that "FA" outputs a triple starting with 1, given an input "x" chosen randomly from "IG". Then
Intuition.
The idea here is to think of "A" as running two times in related executions, where the process "forks" at a certain point, when some but not all of the input has been examined. In the alternate version, the remaining inputs are re-generated but are generated in the normal way. The point at which the process forks may be something we only want to decide later, possibly based on the behavior of "A" the first time around: this is why the lemma statement chooses the branching point ("J") based on the output of "A". The requirement that "hJ" ≠ "h'J" is a technical one required by many uses of the lemma. (Note that since both "hJ" and "h'J" are chosen randomly from "H", then if "h" is large, which would be normal, the probability of the two values not being distinct is extremely small.)
Example.
For example, let "A" be an algorithm for breaking a digital signature scheme in the random oracle model. Then "x" would be the public parameters (including the public key) "A" is attacking, and "hi" would be the output of the random oracle on its "i"th distinct input. The forking lemma is of use when it would be possible, given two different random signatures of the same message, to solve some underlying hard problem. An adversary that forges once, however, gives rise to one that forges twice on the same message with non-negligible probability through the forking lemma. When "A" attempts to forge on a message "m", we consider the output of "A" to be ("J", "y") where "y" is the forgery, and "J" is such that "m" was the "J"th unique query to the random oracle (it may be assumed that "A" will query "m" at some point, if "A" is to be successful with non-negligible probability). (If "A" outputs an incorrect forgery, we consider the output to be (0, "y").)
By the forking lemma, the probability ("frk") of obtaining two good forgeries "y" and "y' " on the same message but with different random oracle outputs (that is, with "hJ ≠ h'J") is non-negligible when "acc" is also non-negligible. This allows us to prove that if the underlying hard problem is indeed hard, then no adversary can forge signatures.
This is the essence of the proof given by Pointcheval and Stern for a modified ElGamal signature scheme against an adaptive adversary.
Known issues with application of forking lemma.
The reduction provided by the forking lemma is not a tight reduction. Pointcheval and Stern proposed security arguments for Digital Signatures and Blind Signature using Forking Lemma. Claus P. Schnorr provided an attack on blind Schnorr signatures schemes, which were argued to be secure by Pointcheval and Stern. Schnorr also suggested enhancements for securing blind signatures schemes based on discrete logarithm problem.

<doc id="19075866" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19075866" title="Ticagrelor">
Ticagrelor

Ticagrelor (trade name Brilinta in the US, Brilique and Possia in the EU) is a platelet aggregation inhibitor produced by AstraZeneca. The drug was approved for use in the European Union by the European Commission on December 3, 2010. The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on July 20, 2011.
Indications.
Ticagrelor is indicated for the prevention of thrombotic events (for example stroke or heart attack) in patients with acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction with ST elevation. The drug is combined with acetylsalicylic acid unless the latter is contraindicated. Treatment of acute coronary syndrome with ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel significantly reduces the rate of death.
Contraindications.
Contraindications for ticagrelor are: active pathological bleeding and a history of intracranial bleeding, as well as reduced liver function and combination with drugs that strongly influence activity of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, because the drug is metabolized via CYP3A4 and excreted via the liver.
Adverse effects.
The most common side effects are shortness of breath (dyspnea, 14%) and various types of bleeding, such as hematoma, nosebleed, gastrointestinal, subcutaneous or dermal bleeding. Allergic skin reactions such as rash and itching have been observed in less than 1% of patients.
Physical and chemical properties.
Ticagrelor is a nucleoside analogue: the cyclopentane ring is similar to the sugar ribose, and the nitrogen rich aromatic ring system resembles the nucleobase purine, giving the molecule an overall similarity to adenosine. The substance has low solubility and low permeability under the Biopharmaceutics Classification System.
Pharmacokinetics.
Ticagrelor is absorbed quickly from the gut, the bioavailability being 36%, and reaches its peak concentration after about 1.5 hours. The main metabolite, AR-C124910XX, is formed quickly via CYP3A4 by de-hydroxyethylation at position 5 of the cyclopentane ring. It peaks after about 2.5 hours. Both ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX are bound to plasma proteins (>99.7%), and both are pharmacologically active. Blood plasma concentrations are linearly dependent on the dose up to 1260 mg (the sevenfold daily dose). The metabolite reaches 30–40% of ticagrelor's plasma concentrations. Drug and metabolite are mainly excreted via bile and feces.
Plasma concentrations of ticagrelor are slightly increased (12–23%) in elderly patients, women, patients of Asian ethnicity, and patients with mild hepatic impairment. They are decreased in patients that described themselves as 'coloured' and such with severe renal impairment. These differences are considered clinically irrelevant. In Japanese people, concentrations are 40% higher than in Caucasians, or 20% after body weight correction. The drug has not been tested in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Mechanism of action.
Like the thienopyridines prasugrel, clopidogrel and ticlopidine, ticagrelor blocks adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptors of subtype P2Y12. In contrast to the other antiplatelet drugs, ticagrelor has a binding site different from ADP, making it an allosteric antagonist, and the blockage is reversible. Moreover, the drug does not need hepatic activation, which might work better for patients with genetic variants regarding the enzyme CYP2C19 (although it is not certain whether clopidogrel is significantly influenced by such variants).
Comparison with clopidogrel.
The PLATO trial,found that ticagrelor had better mortality rates than clopidogrel (9.8% vs. 11.7%, p<0.001) in treating patients with acute coronary syndrome. Patients given ticagrelor were less likely to die from vascular causes, heart attack, or stroke but had greater chances of non-lethal bleeding (16.1% vs. 14.6%, p=0.0084) and higher rate of major bleeding not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting (4.5% vs. 3.8%, P=0.03). While the patient group on ticagrelor had more instances of fatal intracranial bleeding, there were significantly fewer cases of fatal non-intracranial bleeding, leading to an overall neutral effect on fatal or life-threatening bleeding vs. clopidogrel (P=0.70). Rates of major bleeding were not different. Discontinuation of the study drug due to adverse events occurred more frequently with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel (in 7.4% of patients vs. 6.0%, P<0.001).
The PLATO trial showed a statistically insignificant trend toward worse outcomes with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel among US patients in the study – who comprised 1800 of the total 18,624 patients. The HR actually reversed for the composite end point cardiovascular (death, MI, or stroke): 12.6% for patients given ticagrelor and 10.1% for patients given clopidogrel (HR = 1.27). Some believe the results could be due to differences in aspirin maintenance doses, which are higher in the United States. Others state that the central adjudicating committees found an extra 45 MIs in the clopidogrel (comparator) arm but none in the ticagrelor arm, which improved the MI outcomes with ticagrelor. Without this adjudication the trials' primary efficacy outcomes should not be significant.
Consistently with its reversible mode of action, ticagrelor is known to act faster and shorter than clopidogrel. This means it has to be taken twice instead of once a day which is a disadvantage in respect of compliance, but its effects are more quickly reversible which can be useful before surgery or if side effects occur.
Interactions.
Inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole and possibly grapefruit juice, increase blood plasma levels and consequently can lead to bleeding and other adverse effects. Conversely, drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4, for example simvastatin, show increased plasma levels and more side effects if combined with ticagrelor. CYP3A4 inductors, for example rifampicin and possibly St. John's wort, can reduce the effectiveness of ticagrelor. There is no evidence for interactions via CYP2C9.
The drug also inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp), leading to increased plasma levels of digoxin, ciclosporin and other P-gp substrates. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX levels are not significantly influenced by P-gp inhibitors.
In the US a boxed warning states that use of ticagrelor with aspirin doses exceeding 100 mg/day decreases the effectiveness of the medication.

Czechoslovakism

Czechoslovakism (, ) refers to the nationalism of Czechoslovaks and Czechoslovak culture. Czechoslovakism was developed by Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and Edvard Beneš, based on the premise that Czechs and Slovaks are one people who had become divided due to Austro-Hungarian imperial rule and Hungarian assimilationist policies in particular. Czechoslovakists note that a united Czechoslovakian people existed in the historical state of Great Moravia, where the Slavonic tribes of Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia were formerly embraced within Great Moravia. Czechoslovakists typically emphasize secularism to break down the religious divide between Czechs and Slovaks.
While the Cleveland Agreement in 1915 and the Pittsburgh Agreement on May 31, 1918 made allowance for a Czech nation and a Slovak nation, the Washington Czechoslovak declaration of independence on October 18, 1918 mentions only the one Czechoslovak nation. The published version of the Slovak Martin Declaration (October 30, 1918) mentioned "the Slovak branch of the unified Czecho-slovak nation". The original approved text of the Martin Declaration and proceedings were "lost" after the return of Milan Hodža from Budapest. The published text was claimed to be a forgery. Hodža didn't succeed with his proposed changes but had the text willfully changed in the following night. The change consisted in removing the Slovak demand of national self-determination.
This ideology was essential for the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, and for the establishment of the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920. Statistics from the era of the First Republic (1918–1938) mentioned Czechoslovaks rather than Czechs or Slovaks:
Not all people agreed with the ideology (mainly Slovaks). During World War II, when Czechoslovakia was occupied by the German Third Reich, the Slovak Republic was created as a client state of Nazi Germany, and Subcarpathian Ruthenia was annexed by Hungary. After World War II, Czechoslovakia was reunited, but the ideology of one nation was not fully restored.
After the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia had limited the autonomy granted to Slovakia, the Constitutional Law of Federation of 1968 stated that Czechoslovakia was a federation of two national republics and introduced dual citizenship.

Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai

The Movement for Democratic Change Zimbabwe (MDCZ) is a political party and currently the main opposition party in the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe. It is the main formation formed from the split of the original Movement for Democratic Change in 2005.
History.
Foundation.
The Movement for Democratic Change was founded in 1999 as an opposition party to the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party led by President Robert Mugabe. The MDC was formed from members of the broad coalition of civic society groups and individuals that campaigned for a "No" vote in the 2000 constitutional referendum, in particular the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions. The party split following the 2005 Senate election, with the main faction headed by the founder leader Morgan Tsvangirai and the other formation headed by Arthur Mutambara. At the Morgan Tsvangirai-led 2006 Congress, Thokozani Khuphe was elected for Vice-President replacing Gibson Sibanda who was now part of MDC-M.
The two factions subsequently won a combined majority in the March 2008 parliamentary election.
Developments in 2007.
On 3 August 2007 it was widely reported that two officials of the smaller Arthur Mutambara-led MDC formation had defected to the main Tsvangirai-led Movement for Democratic Change Zimbabwe formation, a week after talks to reunite the two parties had broken down. At a media briefing, former Member of Parliament Silas Mangono and Masvingo Province chairman Shaky Matake announced that they had defected from the Mutambara-led formation.
An opinion poll in 27 September 2007 by the Mass Public Opinion Institute of Zimbabwe found that of the 22% of poll respondents who are supporters of the MDC, 21% backed the main MDC formation led Tsvangirai and 1% expressed support for the smaller Mutambara's faction.
The poll takers acknowledged the survey was conducted mainly in the rural areas, traditionally a ZANU-PF stronghold, because the majority of the population lives there. It polled 1,202 of eligible voters.
Political negotiations.
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) mandated South African President Thabo Mbeki to mediate between ZANU-PF and the MDC in April 2007 to create conditions for free and fair elections for the 2008 polls. Mbeki appointed Sydney Mufamadi, South Africa's Minister of Provincial and Local Government, and director-general in the presidency, Frank Chikane, as the main mediators in the talks. All parties agreed to refrain from commenting on the progress of the talks in the media. Due to the media silence, it is relatively difficult to judge the progress of these talks, but both parties have agreed to constitutional amendments and the revision of certain key media and security laws. Critics argue that these changes are superficial and the mediation seems to have had little impact on a practical level. The MDC faction led by Morgan Tsvangirai threatened to pull out of the talks if the conditions were not created in which free and fair elections can take place.
In July and August 2008, the MDC and ZANU-PF entered into negotiations to settle electoral disputes and to reach a compromise. The talks were both mediated by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki.
SADC Facilitated Government Power-Sharing Agreement.
On 15 September 2008, the leaders of the 14-member Southern African Development Community witnessed the signing of the power-sharing agreement, brokered by Mbeki. At the Rainbow Towers hotel in Harare, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed the deal to resolve the crisis. According to the deal, Mugabe will remain president, Tsvangirai will become prime minister, the MDC will control the police, Mugabe's ZANU (PF) party will command the Army, and Mutambara will become deputy prime minister. Tendai Biti has now been confirmed as the Finance Minister in the GNU and will be sworn in on Wednesday 11 November 2009.
New constitution and gay rights.
On 25 October 2011, Zimbabwe's Justice Minister and ZANU-PF member Patrick Chinamasa rejected calls by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai to enshrine gay rights in a new constitution.
Political performance.
Tsvangirai and Mutambara failed to unite on a single MDC candidate for the March 2008 presidential election. Tsvangirai ran for President while Mutambara backed the independent candidacy of Simba Makoni. In the election, Tsvangirai won 47.9% of the vote according to Zimbabwe Electoral Commission results, ahead of Mugabe's 43.2%, necessitating a run-off because neither candidate won a majority. However, Tsvangirai claimed to have won a narrow first-round majority on 50.3% based on the mandatory posting of votes counted at polling booths.
In the simultaneous parliamentary election, both factions contested most seats, with the Tsvangirai faction winning 99 and the Mutambara faction 10, compared with 97 for Zanu PF, 1 independent, leaving 3 vacancies caused by deaths of candidates.
On 28 April 2008, the two factions of the MDC announced that they were reuniting, thus enabling them to have a clear parliamentary majority. As of June 2008, the factions have not formally merged.
International media reported that MDC members and supporters, including prominent activist Tonderai Ndira who was murdered in May, were subjected to arrests, beatings and killings during the campaign period for the second round of the election.
On 22 June 2008, Tsvangirai announced at a press conference that he was withdrawing from the run-off against Mugabe, due to be held on 27 June, describing it as a "violent sham" and saying that his supporters risked being killed if they voted for him. He vowed that the MDC would ultimately prevail and that its victory could "only be delayed".

Route 33 (MTA Maryland)

Route 33 is a bus route operated by the Maryland Transit Administration in Baltimore. The line currently runs from the Rogers Avenue Metro Subway Station in Northwest Baltimore to a loop in Moravia in Northeast Baltimore. Service is provided about once every 10–15 minutes during rush hour, every 20 minutes midday, every 30 minutes on Saturdays, and hourly on Sundays. The line operates primarily along the cross-town corridor of Coldspring Lane and Moravia Road, transversing Arlington, Park Heights, Roland Park, Homeland, and Montebello. The line passes several universities, including Loyola College, Notre Dame, and Morgan State University.
History.
The first bus route to operate along Coldspring Lane was the no. 35 bus, which operated briefly from 1968 to 1969 before being discontinued. The line performed well on AM trips operating to Morgan State, and PM trips from Morgan State, but reverse trips were nearly empty, thereby leading the route to be considered a failure at the time.
The no. 33 designation was previously used in Baltimore transit history for three other routes, including a streetcar that served the Arlington area, near a portion of the present Route 33. The other routes include a streetcar route along Hudson Street that operated 1920-24, and was merged into the no. 18 streetcar (currently bus route 7, and a bus that operated along Milton Street 1950-1954 that is now a part of Route 13.
The current Route 33 started operating in 1977. At that time, it was introduced as an experimental service, with expectations that it would not be successful. It ran on weekdays only during rush hour and midday, and there was no evening or weekend service. Its route was from Arlington to Morgan State only.
About a year later, the line was seen as somewhat of a success. Service was extended during rush hour to the current Moravia loop, and middays to Montebello State Hospital.
The line saw no further improvements until 1986. During that year, evening and Saturday service were added. On weekdays, the line operate until 10 PM, and on Saturdays, intervals were 90 minutes, the most service allowable with a single bus.
In 1993, the line was improved again. All trips were extended to the Moravia loop, and midday service was improved from intervals of 50 to 35 minutes. Evening hours were extended to midnight, and Saturday service was doubled to intervals of 45 minutes.
In 1995, Sunday service on this line was added, though it operated only once every 90 minutes, the previous Saturday frequency.
In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, the line saw an unplanned extension. The original plan was to extend Route 33 to Eastpoint Mall via North Point Boulevard, and to improve the frequency. But with a public outcry in response to the elimination of certain branches on other lines, particularly a deviation on Route 35, Route 33 was extended to provide bus service in those communities. Service that was extended to Eastpoint Mall started operating via the Armistead Gardens community. This resulted in a slight reduction in service frequency except on Sundays. But the frequency of service on this line, which had been proposed for an increase in the original phase of GBBI, was improved in 2006.
Three months later, the route was extended again about a mile to the Essex Park-and-Ride lot in order to improve efficiency in looping. An later modification shifted service from Eastern Avenue to Rolling Mill Road.
On August 30, 2009, all trips on Route 33 were shortened to the Moravia loop, and Route 24 was extended west from Middle River to replace service south of Moravia.

Strictly Come Dancing (series 6)

The sixth series of Strictly Come Dancing began on BBC One on 20 September 2008, with Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly returning as presenters, and Craig Revel Horwood, Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli returning as judges.
The show featured 16 celebrities (two more than the previous series) who were paired with 16 professional dancers. The new professionals were Brian Fortuna and Hayley Holt, who had previously appeared in the American and New Zealand versions of the show respectively, and Russian dancer Kristina Rihanoff, who had taken part in the Dancing with the Stars tour. Nicole Cutler was the only professional from the previous series not to return.
Tom Chambers and Camilla Dallerup were crowned the winners on 20 December 2008.
This was the last series to feature Arlene Phillips on the judging panel, as she was controversially replaced by Alesha Dixon for the seventh series.
Format.
The couples dance each week in a live show. The judges score each performance out of ten (with four judges giving a maximum score of forty). The couples are then ranked according to the judges' scores and given points according to their rank, with the lowest scored couple receiving one point, and the highest scored couple receiving the most points (the maximum number of points available depends on the number of couples remaining in the competition). The public are also invited to vote for their favourite couples, and the couples are ranked again according to the number of votes they receive, again receiving points- the couple with the fewest votes receiving one point, and the couple with the most votes receiving the most points.
The points for judges' score and public vote are then added together, and the two couples with the fewest points are placed in the bottom two (if two couples have equal points, the points from the public vote are given precedence). As with the previous series, the bottom two couples will have to perform a dance-off on the results show. Based on that performance alone, each judge then votes on which couple should stay and which couple should leave, with Goodman (as head judge) having the last and casting vote.
However, the situation was different on 13 December 2008, the semi final, when it was announced in the live results show that all three remaining couples would be going through to the final, regardless of the judges' scores and the public vote. This was due to a tie at the top of the leaderboard, which made it mathematically impossible for Tom Chambers and Camilla Dallerup to avoid the dance-off. Despite this, viewers were encouraged to vote, although the problem was noticed by the start of the results show, which was shortened by 10 minutes. All phone votes cast were carried on to the following Saturday, the final.
Couples.
This year there were 16 couples: 8 male celebrities and 8 female celebrities.

Charles Garrison Harker

Charles Garrison Harker (December 2, 1837 – June 27, 1864) was a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was killed in action at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in northern Georgia during the Atlanta Campaign. Fort Harker in Kansas, an active garrison of the United States Army from 1866 to 1872, was named in his honor.
Early life and career.
Harker was born on December 2, 1835, in Swedesboro, New Jersey. As a youth, he worked as a clerk in a retail store owned by U.S. Congressman Nathan T. Stratton. Through the influences of Stratton, Harker received an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Harker graduated in 1858 with the brevet rank of second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Infantry and was assigned to garrison duty at the United States Army post on Governor's Island in New York Harbor. Subsequently, Harker served at outposts in the Oregon and Washington territories.
Civil War service.
With the outbreak of the Civil War, Harker was assigned to duty in Ohio to help train newly recruited volunteer soldiers. He was promoted to first lieutenant of the 15th U.S. Infantry on May 14, 1861, and then to captain on October 24, 1861. He was subsequently appointed as colonel of the 65th Ohio Infantry, a regiment in the forces of Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. He became the regiment's colonel on November 11, 1861.
Harker and the 65th OVI participated in the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh, as well as the subsequent Siege of Corinth, Mississippi. In late June, he took over command of the 20th Brigade, 6th Division, Army of the Ohio, replacing James A. Garfield. Later that year, he was involved in the Battle of Perryville in Kentucky. Harker received praise for his significant contributions during the Battle of Stones River at the end of the year while leading the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, Left Wing of XIV Corps of the Army of the Cumberland.
In 1863, he was in command of the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, IV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, Military Division of the Mississippi. He again drew the attention of his senior commanders with a determined stand against Confederate attackers during the Battle of Chickamauga in northern Georgia. In recognition of his performance and service, he was promoted to fill an opening as a brigadier general, dating from September 20, 1863. After participating in the fighting around Chattanooga and the assault on Missionary Ridge, he and his men helped relieve Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside during the Siege of Knoxville. 
In mid-1864, as the Atlanta Campaign began, Harker commanded a brigade under Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard. On May 7, he successfully held the peak of Rocky Face Ridge despite determined Confederate efforts to dislodge his men. In June William T. Sherman's Union army attempted to displace Confederate troops from their fortifications on Kennesaw Mountain. Harker was shot from his horse and mortally wounded during a failed attack on June 27, 1864. His body was shipped back to his native Swedesboro, New Jersey, where it was buried in Trinity Episcopal Church Cemetery.
In popular culture.
Harker is portrayed by Bob Gunton in the 1989 Civil War film, "Glory".

John Berry (film director)

John Berry (September 6, 1917 – November 29, 1999) was an American film director, who went into self-exile in France when his career was interrupted by the Hollywood blacklist.
Early life.
John Berry was born Jak Szold in The Bronx, New York, the son of a Polish Jewish father and a Romanian mother. He began his entertainment career by as a child performer in vaudeville, first going on stage at the age of 4. In his teens, he briefly worked as a boxer under the name "Jackie Sold". Berry's father was a restaurateur, and at one point he owned 28 restaurants around New York City. His father went out of business during the Great Depression, and Berry sought to support himself by working as a comedian and actor.
Mercury Theatre and Hollywood.
His first big break came when he was hired by the Mercury Theatre for a presentation of "Julius Caesar" that was produced by John Houseman and directed by Orson Welles. Berry acted in other roles with the theater and assisted Welles in directing the 1942 production of "Native Son". In a late-life interview with "The New York Times", Berry spoke positively of his association with Welles and Houseman. "It was like living near the center of a volcano of creating inspiration and fury, glamorous and exciting, full of the kind of theatricality that seems lost forever," he said.
In 1943, Houseman was producing films in Hollywood at Paramount Pictures and he hired Berry to direct the film "Miss Susie Slagle's" starring Veronica Lake and Lillian Gish. Berry stayed in Hollywood and directed other features, most notably "From This Day Forward" starring Joan Fontaine, "Cross My Heart" with Betty Hutton, the musical "Casbah" with Tony Martin and Yvonne De Carlo, and "He Ran All the Way" (1951) starring John Garfield and Shelley Winters.
Blacklisted.
In 1950, Berry agreed to direct a short documentary on the Hollywood 10, a group of directors and writers who refused to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in their pursuit of supposed Communist Party infiltration within the U.S. film industry. After directing the crime drama "He Ran All the Way", Berry was named as a communist by fellow director Edward Dmytryk, a Hollywood Ten member who had been jailed for contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with HUAC. After being released from prison, Dmytryk had gone into exile in England, but subsequently, he sought to reenter the Hollywood film industry. Thus, ex-Party member Dymytrk voluntarily testified before HUAC in April 1951, clearing himself by "naming names."
Berry was one of the 26 alleged "communists" named by Dmytryk, who was then able to resume his career. Berry was also named as a communist by ex-Communist Party member Frank Tuttle. (Tuttle also testified before HUAC in 1951, after returning from Vienna, Austria to clear his name and regain employment in Hollywood by "naming names". ) Unable to secure work, Berry left the U.S. and resettled with his family in Paris. "He Ran All the Way" would be the last American film Berry directed for nearly a quarter of a century.
In France, Berry was hired to co-direct "Atoll K", the film comedy film of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. However, the blacklisted Berry did not receive screen credit; only French director Léo Joannon was credited as director.
During the 1950s, Berry directed two films starring Eddie Constantine, "Ça va barder" (1953) and "Je suis un sentimental" (1955), and he also directed "Tamango" (1958), a film about a slave uprising that starred Dorothy Dandridge.
Exile's return.
The blacklist was broken in 1960 with the release of two films written by blacklisted Hollywood Ten member Dalton Trumbo, "Exodus" and "Spartacus", which gave Trumbo (one of the most prominent of the Ten) his first screen credits since being blackballed by Hollywood. With the blacklist broken, Berry returned to the U.S. in the early 1960s, where he directed episodes of the TV shows "East Side/West Side" and "Seaway".
He continued to work in France, but again returned to the U.S in the 1970s and directed several films, most notably "Claudine" (1974), starring Diahann Carroll in an Academy Award-nominated performance, and "The Bad News Bears Go to Japan" (1978). At the time of his death in Paris, he was editing "Boesman and Lena", a film version of the Athol Fugard play starring Danny Glover and Angela Bassett.
Legacy.
John Berry divided the remainder of his career between theater direction in London and film direction in Paris. His experiences during the Hollywood blacklist era were the inspiration of the character played by Robert De Niro in the film "Guilty by Suspicion" (1991). Berry had played Ben, the night club owner, in the movie "Round Midnight" (1986), which had been produced by Irwin Winkler, the writer-director of "Guilty by Suspicion".)
Berry, looking back at his career for an interview with "Newsday", remarked: "I wouldn't give up my life for anything. I have been a curiously blessed individual despite all I've lived through."
Dennis Berry, also a film director, was his son.

Pasquale Barra

Pasquale Barra is a former Italian Camorrista who was a senior member and hitman for the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO), a Camorra organization in Naples. Barra has the distinction of being the first NCO member to become a pentito, when he decided to collaborate with Italian Justice in 1982. 
Barra sported numerous nicknames, both self-appointed and those given to him. The first one was ""'o Sturiente"" (The Student), which was given to him by Cutolo during his years as a student in Ottaviano. Then there was his public nickname, ""'o Nimale"" (The Animal), which was allegedly given to him by the Italian media. The third one was ""Alias"", a self-appointed war name.
Biography.
Association with the NCO.
A native of Ottaviano, the same town near Naples where Neapolitan crime boss, Raffaele Cutolo was born, Barra was the first and most devoted member of Cutolo's gang ever since they were both teenagers. At 6'3 iches tall, he was physically impressive with a lean and athletic build. When Cutolo set up the NCO at their hometown on October 24, 1970, Barra became his second in command and immediately took charge of reinforcing all intimidation, extortion and racketeering activities within their territory. He became a full-time killer for the organization, favoring the use of knives and butchery tools over guns and automatic weapons to carry out his hits.
Relationship with Raffaele Cutolo.
The relationship between Barra and Cutolo had always been a close one. From the very beginning, Barra had been a faithful follower of Cutolo whom he practically revered. Moreover, being a more practical and ordinary man, he was able to muffle some of the more extreme features of Cutolo's behavior and reveal them to the other people who would have otherwise been simply too scared to approach Cutolo. Barra was in fact the de facto link between Cutolo and other NCO members, bridging Cutolo's charisma with a more practical vision of life. As such, Cutolo greatly appreciated Barra's role within the organization. 
For instance, when Cutolo purchased a 16th-century castle in Ottaviano which had previously belonged to the Medici dynasty, he had a special postcard of the castle printed with the caption ""Castello Mediceo, private property of R. Cutolo and P. Barra."" His great admiration for Barra was expressed in a poem entitled ""N'omme 'e Camorra"" (A man of the Camorra) which was written by him for Barra's birthday.
Chief of Ottaviano.
During the period between 1976 and 1983, when the NCO had total control over Ottaviano and the Neapolitan hinterland, Barra ruled this town of 200,000 inhabitants as his own personal fiefdom, ruling on every aspect of the town's activities, from illegal businesses such as prostitution, gambling and extortion to more respectable businesses. The NCO even had their own men inside the city council. When Barra's younger brother was shot in the knee-caps by a rival gang, they were able to find him a job inside City Hall, after having provided him with a governmental pension for an alleged permanent infirmity.
War with the Nuova Famiglia.
Barra's arrest in 1979 did not diminish his influence inside and outside of prison. On the contrary, he established himself as the second in command of the organizational executive board inside the "cielo scoperto" (i.e., the prison penitentiary system). When the NCO began its long standing war against the rival Camorra clans, particularly the newly formed Nuova Famiglia, he decided to primarily concentrate on the killing of rivals inside the prison system. It was during this time that the media started calling him ""the killer of the prisons,"" and he acquired the nickname ""'o Nimale"" (The Animal), due to the utmost cruelty and pitiless way in which he killed his enemies. His many murder convictions earned him a life sentence from the Italian court.
He pursued his newly appointed mission with a fervent religious zeal and he became almost suicidal in his attempts to eliminate his adversaries. He never worried about getting caught. In fact, some of his letters sent to other members of the NCO attest to his thirst for blood. He once wrote to Marco Medda, an NCO board executive: ""Brother, I beg you to give a kiss to our Prince (Cutolo). I am doing all I can to get transferred to Napoli to kill some of these scumbags, and I will perform one of my best dramas: they must pay, understand?"" 
In another letter to Cutolo's sister, Rosetta, he used even stronger words while describing about his project: ""My dearest comare, regarding this crawling vermin (the traitors), be confident. I will give you full satisfaction. I was so nervous that my own liver rotted because i did not have a chance yet to meet and greet these scumbags. I am telling you: be calm. I will take care of them with the help of the people who love the prince (Cutolo) for life and death.""
When one of Cutolo's major enemies was arrested, Barra wrote directly to Cutolo: ""My dearest compare, you have heard about the arrest of that big don. He peed in his pants because he thought that he got caught by the men of the Prince. Now tell me how these people think that they can survive, and anyway I am waiting to cross the paths of some of these conspirators, because I want to show them how much Alias is worth. Be calm, they will pay with their last drop of blood.""
Killing rivals.
In just a couple of years Barra had amassed an impressive list of killings, the most famous of which were the three deadly assaults that occurred during the 1980 Irpinia earthquake. During the night of November 18, 1980, an earthquake of 6.8 on the Richter scale hit Naples and the Campania region. In the Poggioreale prison, the confusion and terror were magnified by the feeling of being entrapped. In order to avoid panic and a greater disaster, the prisoners were allowed to go to the jail courtyard presumed to be safer from collapsing buildings. However, this decision made by the prison authorities had an unintended consequence. The courtyard soon became a battlefield. Old rancors, impending vendettas and gang feud's exploded and were resolved in the bloodiest ways. Among many assassinations, Barra personally killed three rival NF members. These hits as well as many others greatly increased Barra's prestige and standing among the other NCO members.
Murder of Francis Turatello.
However, it was another murder which would eventually lead to his downfall and subsequent defection from the NCO. On August 17, 1981, under Cutolo's orders Barra organized an ambush to kill Milanese crime boss and Cosa Nostra associate, Francis Turatello aka ""Faccia D'Angelo"" (Angel Face) in the courtyard of Bad'e Carros, the high security prison in Nuoro, Sardinia. Barra was assisted in the murder by two well known Sicilian assassins, Vincenzo Andraus and Antonino Faro. Turatello was unable to escape the ambush. Barra and Andraus held Turatello, while Faro stabbed him sixty times. In the ensuing confusion from the attack, Andraus was also wounded and would later receive minor surgery in the prison infirmary. After Turatello was dead, Faro disemboweled and chewed Turatello's intestines, then spat it out as a sign of contempt. 
Among the two Sicilian hitmen, Barra had come to know Faro well. Faro and Andraus were from Catania, Sicily. Faro was 28 years old at the time of Turatello's murder and by then, had already been convicted of five murders. Barra once wrote to Cutolo about him: ""Catania, with its sons, must be hugged by the prince."" The murder resulted in the two assassins being more loyal to Cutolo than to anyone else. By involving both Faro and Andraus in the murder, Barra hoped to share responsibility with the Sicilian Mafia over the murder. The rationale for this was that the Mafia would never allow a killing of which it did not approve.
Downfall.
However, the two assassins were from an Eastern Sicilian family headed by Giuseppe Calderone, not involved with the ruling corporate group of the Sicilian Mafia based in Western Sicily. As a result, the whole plot backfired. Turatello had close and powerful contacts within the Sicilian Mafia. Frank Coppola, a powerful Gambino family figure in New York City, was his godfather and Luciano Leggio, the head of the Corleonesi faction of the Sicilian Mafia had himself put Turatello in charge of all drug trade in the region of Milan.
They took Turatello's murder as an insult to their honor and reacted angrily. They held Cutolo responsible for the murder and threatened to immediately retaliate against him. Faced with certain defeat against the Mafia, with threats against his life already carried out, Cutolo chose to dissociate himself from the murder. 
Through his sister, Cutolo told the Sicilians that he had never wanted Turatello killed and that Barra had acted out on his own. He claimed that Barra was in fact, a former friend who had turned into a crazed out of control assassin. Moreover, he promised to collaborate with them in taking care of Barra. Barra was not only left alone to fend off the reprisals of the Sicilians, but now he also had to watch out against violent attacks from the other NCO members.
Becoming a Pentito.
Barra had barely escaped two attacks and was completely stressed out by being on the lookout 24 hours a day. He avoided contact with everyone and chose to prepare his own tea and coffee, while carrying a knife carefully hidden in his anus at all times. Following this betrayal by Cutolo and his abandonment by the NCO, Pasquale Barra decided to become a pentito. From his cell in the local penitentiary in Foggia, Barra summoned Judge Apperti to inform him of his decision to collaborate with the Justice Department on October 18, 1982, thus becoming the first NCO member to become an informant. 
In exchange for greater protection, Barra decided to reveal details of NCO murders, and went on to testify against Cutolo and numerous NCO members during the three-year-long Maxi Trials which resulted from the NCO's crackdown in 1983. Barra's testimony along with those of Giovanni Pandico, Pasquale D'Amico, Mario Incarnato, etc. were found reliable and convincing enough to become a significant factor in the convictions of more than 800 defendants. However, many of the pentiti's allegations were proved to be fabrications and several of the convicted defendants were released.

Kosovo–Latvia relations

Kosovan–Latvian relations are foreign relations between the Republic of Kosovo and Latvia. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and Latvia recognized it on 20 February 2008. Latvian and Kosovan governments established diplomatic relations on 11 June 2008. However, Latvia's involvement in Kosovo dates back to 2000 when it first sent peacekeeping troops.
History.
In 2000, Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga suggested that NATO's willingness to intervene in Kosovo means that the Western alliance will be prepared to come to the aid of Latvia and other East European countries should Moscow threaten them at some point in the future. She said: Kosovo is not a member of the NATO alliance and yet the alliance was able to take action when it felt that, according to the principles on which it is founded, action and intervention was necessary.I would expect it to do no less anywhere else in Europe.
In November 2005, Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova met Latvian Foreign Minister, Artis Pabriks.
Following the formal recognition of Kosovo in February 2008, Latvian Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins said: "Latvia is ready to share its experience in order to facilitate Kosovo's development towards its Europeisation". The Minister also stressed the significance of Latvia's involvement in both the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo), the key objective of which is to assist Kosovan public administration, courts, and law enforcement bodies, and in the International Steering Group for Kosovo.
In July 2008, Foreign Minister Riekstins visited Kovoso and met with President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi and Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni. President Seijdiu said he was appreciative of the work of the representatives of the Latvian Contingent within the NATO-led peacekeeping forces (KFOR), and also the participation of Latvian experts in the EU Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) in Kosovo.
During this visit, Minister Riekstins said: "One can draw certain parallels between the history of Latvia and Kosovo, because Latvia too in the early 1990s had to start from the very beginning in the formation of state institutions, this is precisely why we are prepared to share our experience with the government of Kosovo, offering both our political and practical support." 
Peacekeeping.
In July 1999, the Latvian Parliament approved by a majority of 71-6 to send peacekeepers to Kosovo. In 2000, the first Latvian troops were sent to Kosovo for peacekeeping. In 2005, Latvia committed 105 troops to the peacekeeping effort in Kosovo. Latvia currently has 17 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO led Kosovo Force.

Geoffrey Allard

Flight Lieutenant Geoffrey "Sammy" Allard DFC, DFM & Bar was a British RAF flying ace of the Second World War. Allard scored 19 victories against enemy aircraft, as well as five shared kills, two probable kills during the war.
Early life.
Allard was born in York in September 1912 the son of Sydney Harold Allard and Elizabeth Allard (née Higgins). He joined the RAF in 1929, and served an apprenticeship at RAF Halton, qualifying as a LAC mechanic. He applied for pilot training in 1936 and became a Sergeant Pilot with No. 87 Squadron RAF in 1937.
He married Kathleen Minnie Ross in York in 1937. In June 1938 he joined No. 85 Squadron RAF.
Second World War.
He was made a Flight Sergeant on 17 August 1940 (with seniority from 15 August).
Eight more kills were scored in the Battle of Britain between 24 August 1940 and 1 September 1940. Recognised as one of the cream of The Few, Allard was selected by Fighter Command to have his portrait drawn by Cuthbert Orde, sitting for it on the same day that he was awarded a second Distinguished Flying Medal, 13 September 1940.
In October the Squadron was withdrawn to become a night-fighter unit. He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) the same month.
On 6 December 1940, Allard was promoted from Pilot Officer to Flying Officer.
On 13 March 1941, Allard was scheduled to take the newly promoted P/O Francis "Frank" Walker-Smith to RAF Ford to collect a version of the twin-engined Douglas Boston (known to the RAF as the Douglas Havoc and used primarily for night-fighting duties). At the last moment New Zealand ace P/O William Henry "Ace" Hodgson (who was reputed to have a girlfriend at RAF Ford) hitched a lift. A loose gun inspection panel became dislodged and flew back jamming the rudder. This caused the aircraft to crash, killing all three occupants at Wimbish, close to RAF Debden.
Allard and Walker-Smith had seen action together as part of the British Expeditionary Force (based at Lille/Seclin, France) in early 1940 and all three had success as Battle of Britain pilots.
Allard is buried alongside Hodgson and Walker-Smith at the Saffron Walden Cemetery.
Honours and awards.
13 September 1940 – 563859 Sergeant Geoffrey Allard DFM is awarded a bar to the Distinguished Flying Medal.
8 October 1940 – The Distinguished Flying Cross is awarded to Pilot Officer Geoffrey Allard, DFM, (44551) — "Between 30 August and 1 September 1940, this officer destroyed seven enemy aircraft; previously he had destroyed ten and shared in the destruction of others. He has displayed outstanding skill and courage in combat against the enemy."
On 12 March 2011, a 70th anniversary commemorative event was staged at Carver Barracks – the old RAF Debden near Saffron Walden – which is 85 Squadron's World War II spiritual home. Relatives and friends of the three men who died on 13 March 1941 met at the Officers' Mess. The event included a display by a Supermarine Spitfire from the Historical Aircraft Collection (a last-minute substitute for the planned Hawker Hurricane flypast) and a Memorial Service held in Wimbish Church, the parish church for RAF Debden. On 13 March 2011, there was a ceremonial laying of wreaths on the graves of Allard, Hodgson and Walker-Smith in Radwinter Road Cemetery, Saffron Walden, and the official naming of a road in the town called "Allard Way".

Route 59 (MTA Maryland)

Route 59 is a bus route operated by the Maryland Transit Administration in Baltimore and its suburbs, mostly along Reisterstown Road. The line currently runs from the Reisterstown Plaza Metro Subway Station to the Owings Mills Town Center. The line was a split-off from Route M-9, and resembles the pre-1997 route of Route M-9. It is the successor to several other bus routes and streetcars.
History.
Route 59 has only been operating since February 17, 2008. Prior to this date, the no. 59 designation was never used for a bus operating on Reisterstown Road. The only other bus route in Baltimore transit history that had the no. 59 designation was the Colgate Shuttle, a service that operated during rush hour from 1948 to 1952. But the Reisterstown Road corridor between Pikesville and Owings Mills has a history of being served by many other bus routes and streetcar lines.
1916 to 1932.
Service on Reisterstown Road was provided by the No. 5 Streetcar Line, which ran from Emory Grove to Patterson Park, providing all transit service than offered along any parts of Reisterstown Road. The no. 5 streetcar was had the most northern point of all Baltimore streetcars. At this time, the Owings Mills area was minimally developed.
1932 to 1948.
In 1932, the no. 5 streetcar was shortened to Pikesville. Service between Pikesville and Emory Grove was provided by Bus Route M (no relationship to "M-lines").
1948 to 1959.
In 1948, the no. 5 streetcar was completely converted to a bus operated. The new line was identified as the no. 5/7 line.
1959 to 1984.
The no. 7 bus line provided service on all parts of Reisterstown Road from Glyndon to Pennsylvania and North Avenues, then continued along Pennsylvania Avenue to downtown Baltimore and Canton along the same route as the present no. 7 line. Even after the no. 7 line was shortened in 1984 in favor of shorter Metro feeder buses, the no. 7 line continued to operate along this full route until 2001, when the Metro connection buses started to operate 7 days a week, some 24 hours a day.
1984 to 1987.
Following the opening of the Baltimore Metro, a new series of feeder buses were developed to bring riders into Metro stations. During this time, Route P-4 operated along virtually the same route as Route 59, with the exception of the deviation into the Owings Mills Metro Station, which at the time, did not exist. Additionally, Route P-1 overlapped along Reisterstown Road, then operated to Reisterstown.
1987 to 1997.
During the years 1987 to 1997, Route M-9 operated over the present route of Route 59. The line started by running from Reisterstown Plaza to the Owings Mills Metro Subway Station at most times, with trips before 9 AM continuing to the Owings Mills Town Center. After 9 AM, service to between the Metro Station and Town Center was provided by a shuttle identified as Route M-17, no relationship to the current Route M-17 that serves other parts of the Owings Mills area.
In June 1992, the Route M-17 shuttle was discontinued, and service was provided by extending all trips on Routes M-9 and M-16 to the Owings Mills Town Center. At the same time, Route M-15, which duplicated service on Route M-9 and several other routes, was discontinued. The only section of Route M-15 that was not covered by any other bus lines was a branch of selected trips to Business Center at Owings Mills. To replace this service, six daily M-9 trips were extended to this location. Currently, this service is not provided by Route 59, but by Route M-17.
1997 to 2008.
In 1997, Route M-9 was combined with Route M-16. A single line was formed that operated between the Reisterstown Plaza Metro Subway Station and Reisterstown, with all trips operating via the Owings Mills Town Center. A new Route M-17 was formed to provide service on all special branches.
In 1999, the destination signs of the buses bound for Reisterstown were marked ""Glyndon"" in order to avoid confusion with those in the opposite direction marked ""Reisterstown Plaza Station"".
In September 2001, all Metro connection buses, except those that operated weekdays only, were expanded to operate 7 days a week for the first time. The schedules of all at the time, including Route M-9, matched those of Saturday service.
2008 to Present.
On February 17, 2008, the M-9 line was split into two new routes: nos. 59 and 56. These routes resemble the former original Routes M-9 and M-16, respectively. This was done in order to improve schedule adherence on both routes.
On August 30, 2009 Route M-17 was discontinued and service along Red Run Boulevard was replaced by extending peak hour service on Route 59 to Red Land Court. These trips do not enter the Owings Mills Mall parking lot (Mill Run Circle), but pass Owings Mills Mall on Red Run Boulevard.

Grey Mare's Tail, Conwy

The Grey Mare's Tail is a waterfall on the very edge of the Snowdonia National Park near Gwydir Castle in the county of Conwy, north Wales. It lies just off the B5106 road between the town of Llanrwst and the large village of Trefriw. The origins of the name are unknown, other than being descriptive, and its Welsh name, "Rhaeadr y Parc Mawr" ("Parc Mawr waterfall"), is rarely used. This Welsh name derives from the fact that the falls are fed by a large stream that has its source in the Gwydir Forest, and flows through the old Parc Mine, about a mile to the southeast.
In all there are some ten types of waterfall, a horsetail being described as a fall where the descending water maintains some contact with bedrock.
Despite its name, this waterfall actually comprises two cascades, the water flowing around both sides of a large rock at the top. However this was possibly not always the case—in 1895 Francis Frith published a postcard showing the "White Mare's Tail Cascade, Llanrwst". Although only showing a single waterfall—as opposed to today's twin cascades—it is probable from the woodland setting that this is indeed the same location.
Below the falls is a shallow plunge pool, and on leaving the wood the waters flow under the road to join eventually the River Conwy.
The woodland area in which the falls lie is known as "Coed Felin Blwm" ("Lead Mill Wood"), and the remains of mill buildings can be seen near the falls. Felin Blwm lead mill (a name now taken by the adjacent house) was originally erected by the Gwydir Estate to crush ore from Parc Mine in the Gwydir Forest and it is possible that this is the mill listed in surviving 18th-century Estate accounts. A later decline in lead mining saw the mill converted to a sawmill. Both lead and wood from this site was transported down the River Conwy from Trefriw.
The waters of the falls are not especially pure because of the minerals (not just lead) in the rocks of the Gwydir Forest.
When Sir John Wynn was laying out the ornamental gardens at Gwydir Castle in the 1590s, he took a spur of water from above the falls, channelling it along the hillside in a leat. Collected in a header tank, from here the water was of sufficient pressure to feed the fountain in the gardens.
In her book "Castles in the Air", the current owner of Gwydir Castle describes the waterfall thus:
The area around the falls is now a nature reserve, owned by the Forestry Commission, as is much of the adjacent Gwydir Forest. There is a tiny signed car park at the gate, but otherwise the existence of the falls is not signed at all, and remains unknown to many who pass by. The falls can also be reached from above, from the lane which leads up to the hamlet of Llanrhychwyn.

Curly Howard (DJ)

Howard Sisk (c. 1930-October 1, 2001), known on the air as Curly Howard, was a disc jockey on several North Carolina (United States) radio stations.
When Howard joined WKMT in Kings Mountain, North Carolina in 1992, he had spent more than 30 years in radio. 18 of these were at WKBX in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He married Jerri September 26, 1966, and had a son Gregg, who was 21 when Howard joined WKMT.
Early life.
Howard grew up in Shelby, North Carolina with Don Gibson, the country music performer best known for "Oh Lonesome Me" and the writer of "I Can't Stop Loving You". He and Gibson went to country music concerts at the National Guard armory, and when he heard Red Foley sing "Peace in the Valley", Howard cried. He dreamed not of becoming a cowboy or a firefighter, but of being able to sing in such a way that he could touch people the way Foley did.
At 15, Howard saw an ad in "Billboard" for a guitarist and singer for "a small-time traveling tent show", and he went to Greeneville, Tennessee and asked for the job. He was offered the job because his parents, believing he would get homesick, didn't try to stop him. Howard ended up spending fourteen years on the road. He ended up performing alongside Lash LaRue and Fuzzy St. John and "hayseed comics".
Career.
Later, Howard performed on a national radio show, "Virginia Barn Dance". At Louisiana Hayride with Faron Young and Webb Pierce, Howard met Hank Williams Sr. and Elvis Presley. Howard shook Williams' hand, and he observed how the audience loved Williams so much he received a standing ovation before he had even sung.
Howard's own career wasn't going anywhere, but he was making $50 to $60 a week, good money at the time. Later he decided to go into radio in eastern North Carolina. He eventually moved to WKBX. While he was at WKBX, Howard told his friend Roger Stockton, who worked for WSJS radio, that WSJS-FM should switch to country music. Stockton listened and WTQR became the number one station in the market.
In addition to his on-air duties, Howard served as a master of ceremonies at country music shows. Soon, his career at WKBX ended, because the 10,000-watt daytime-only station could not compete with WTQR, and the station dropped country music.
Howard moved to WCGC in Belmont for five years, then to WSVM in Valdese, then back to WCGC for three and a half years, when he was told they could not afford him. Four months after leaving WCGC, Howard was back on the air as morning host at WKMT in Kings Mountain, run by his old friend Jonas Bridges, who had worked with him in the early 1950s on a Shelby radio station. The station's format of country, bluegrass and gospel music had not changed in years.
By 1993, Howard was paired with Tobie Sawyer. In 1995, Tommy Faile, formerly of Arthur Smith and the Crackerjacks, was his partner.
Howard's last broadcast was September 28, 2001 from the Shelby Fair. At the time he was doing a "Swap Shop" program on Piedmont Super Station, selling commercial time, and doing remote broadcasts. He died October 1 at 71.
Style.
Howard's style was compared to that of Grady Cole of WBT (AM), because he talked "directly and personally" to his listeners. He described his voice as "cultivated ... sometimes it even sounds like it's plowed under." He would hang out at the stores he did commercials for, and he would talk to the people there just like he was one of them. On the air he would tell stories about his days as a performer, let people call in to tell what was going on in their lives, and play records. In one commercial, he talked about the 11-pound turnip he saw.

IMBEL

IMBEL is an acronym for Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil (Brazilian War Material Industry) a Brazilian state company, founded in 1975 as a quango of the Ministry of Defence.
Its missions are to cooperate in the planning and production of war material through the transfer of technology, encouraging the creation of new industries and provide financial and technical assistance to them; administer their own industrial and commercial park of war material, and promote development for other activities related to their goals.
History.
IMBEL was founded on July 16, 1934, in the city of Itajubá, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The original factory was designated Fábrica de Canos e Sabres para Armas Portáteis (Barrels and Sabres Factory for Portable Arms) and later as Fabrica de Itajubá (FI) which directly involved the Brazilian Army in the production of military material.
On July 14, 1975 the Law no. 6227 created Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil - IMBEL, linked to the Ministry of the Army and with defined policies to promote based on private initiative, deployment and development of the war material industry of interest to the Army. Later the concept and policies were expanded to promote the military material industry in Brazil.
The military material industry has expanded and specialized to the point of receiving international recognition, with research work, design and implementation done by the Itajubá plant.
It was initially involved in manufacturing Mauser rifles.

Vickers V-1000

The Vickers-Armstrongs V-1000 was a prototype jet-powered cargo aircraft designed to a UK Ministry of Supply requirement for a strategic transport to support the V bomber fleet. Both the Ministry and Vickers also intended to use the same basic design as the VC7, a six-abreast trans-Atlantic jet airliner for BOAC. With the prototype largely complete, the Ministry of Supply cancelled the development contract in 1955. By this time the design had garnered interest from the airlines, and led to re-designs in the competing US Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. The V-1000 is one of the great "what-ifs" of British aviation, and its cancellation was the topic of considerable debate in the House of Commons.
History.
All of the manufacturers supplying designs for the V bombers considered airliner derivatives at one point or another. Perhaps the least innovative of these was the Vickers VC5, which was essentially a slightly-stretched Vickers Valiant bomber with windows. It retained the Valiant's shoulder-mounted wing, which would have left many rows windowless, and also meant that it had long landing gear that BOAC considered unsuitable. Originally designed in the late 1940s, the VC5 attracted little interest and was dropped.
New beginnings.
In 1952 the UK Ministry of Supply (MoS) offered a contract for a jet-powered transport that would be able to support the V bomber fleet through cargo and crew freighting, as well as in-flight refuelling. There was an unstated criterion that the aircraft would also be adaptable as an airliner design for BOAC, then government-run. All of the V bomber entrants responded with designs.
Handley Page offered the HP.97, which featured a two-level layout that moved the passenger seating above the wing of a design otherwise almost identical to the Handley Page Victor. BOAC rejected the design, which led to the more highly-modified HP.111, which was similar in layout but had a modern six-abreast single-deck fuselage.
Avro started with their Vulcan design, keeping its tailless delta wing planform and mating it with a new fuselage, producing the Avro Atlantic (Avro Type 722). As the name implies, the design was specifically intended to offer trans-Atlantic range. Avro boasted that the delta wing offered good takeoff performance without the need for flaps or slats that conventional wings would require, while also offering a high cruising speed. Various versions were offered with 2+2 to 3+3 seating, with the added oddity that the seats faced to the rear of the aircraft.
Vickers re-visited their VC5 and decided to modify it more heavily for the new requirements. A larger 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) fuselage was added with six-abreast seating for 131 passengers. The wings were moved to a low-mounted position, slotted flaps were added, and the wing was made considerably larger. Their new design won the MoS competition in March 1953, and work started on a prototype, serial number "XD662", along with an order for six production versions.
The VC7 was of some concern in the United States, where both Boeing and Douglas were in the process of designing their own jet transports to a very similar requirement from Strategic Air Command. Both companies had responded with designs sized for 2+3 seating (the original 707 design was 2+2), and had smaller passenger capabilities than the VC7. Additionally, the VC7's wing design offered a number of advanced features and increased wing area that greatly reduced take-off run and allowed it to operate from a wider selection of airports, while at the same time offering longer ranges. Finally, the VC7 was intending to use the Rolls-Royce Conway, the first production bypass engine, which further increased range and improved fuel economy.
When these companies approached carriers with their plans, they found that they were constantly rejected as the VC7 was more interesting. Both companies started expensive re-design projects to compete, enlarging the fuselage to match the VC7's 3+3 layout, and increasing the size and weights of the aircraft as a whole. When they were re-introduced to the markets in this larger form in 1955, they fared considerably better, and after an initial order from Pan American Airways, orders started rolling in from around the world. The better range that the VC7 offered took longer to address, and at one point was solved by incorporating the Conway into those designs.
Cancellation.
In 1955, BOAC started expressing concerns about the project, notably their reservations about the Conway engine all of the designs were based on. The Conway, the world's first turbofan, was still in development and was by no means a "sure thing". Instead, BOAC claimed that they were perfectly happy with the Bristol Britannia for their trans-Atlantic routes, and would remain so until an enlarged de Havilland Comet 4 arrived in a few years.
At the same time, the MoS was experiencing budget pressures, and wanted to move the budget assigned to the V-1000 to other projects to avoid their cancellation. They also started to question the need to support the V bomber fleet at long distances, given the ever-shrinking Empire. Finally, they stated that Transport Command's needs for strategic airlift were immediate, and chose to purchase several Britannias of their own to fill this role. This coincided with political pressure to bolster employment in Northern Ireland, where much of the production of the de Havilland Comet 2 was to have been conducted under licence by Short Brothers. The Comet's cancellation had left Short's with a bleak future, and an order for Britannias, to be built in the same factory, was seen as providing a neat solution for all concerned.
In the end, BOAC's decision would quickly be reversed when it became clear that their competitors were going to enter the jet age before them. The VC7 had been cancelled by this point, and a study demonstrated it would be too costly to restart the line. Instead, BOAC ordered the Boeing 707 in October 1956, ironically in a special model to be powered by the Conway. Contrary to BOAC's worries, the Conway proved to have an almost flawless development cycle, and on several occasions outstripped the development of the models it was meant to power. Likewise, the attempt to save other military projects proved futile, and almost all ongoing projects were cancelled as part of the 1957 Defence White Paper.
As had been pointed out at the time, the VC7's performance from limited airfields was considerably better than that of the Boeing 707, which required long runways and extensive ground support. This limited the BOAC 707s to high-volume routes between larger well-equipped airports in Europe and North America. BOAC was also under strong political pressure to offer jet service on a number of limited-capacity "Empire routes" that the Boeing could not service, and turned to Vickers for a solution. The result was the Vickers VC10, with additional power and a smaller fuselage that dramatically improved "hot and high" performance. Although the VC10 was successful in this role, most of the airports for which it had been designed were soon improved sufficiently for the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 to be able to serve them comfortably after all. The VC10 lost its competitive edge, and sold only in limited numbers.
Parliamentary debate.
The cancellation led to a lengthy series of questions in the House that went on for weeks. John Peyton characterised it as "this disappointing and retrograde decision". Deputy Leader of the Labour Party George Brown asked "does not this decision mean that the American companies, the Douglas and the Boeing, will, in effect, be so far ahead of us in the next development of the pure jet that we shall have 10 or 20 years to make up at some stage afterwards?", a prediction that proved astonishingly accurate. Air Commodore Arthur Vere Harvey expressed concerns of the industry in general, while William Robson Brown questioned the wisdom of cancelling at such a late date given that £2.3 million had been invested in the project.
In response, the Minister of Supply, Reginald Maudling, noted that it was extremely unlikely that other airlines would order the VC7, as "everyone concerned accepts that we cannot launch an aircraft of this category into the markets of the world unless we first have a home purchaser who will buy and operate it, which is not so in this case." He declined to offer continued financial support to Vickers for the civilian model for this reason. He also claimed that development was lagging and weight had increased to offset performance.
These later claims were attacked several weeks later in a lengthy statement by Paul Williams, who pointed out that weight had indeed increased, but Rolls-Royce had addressed this by increasing power to offset this effect. He also noted that the aircraft had a built-in margin of safety due to its larger wing. He described the entire issue as "one of the most disgraceful, most disheartening and most unfortunate decisions that has been taken in relation to the British aircraft industry in recent years."
Debate on the issue continued, and the V-1000 continued to come up in debate as late as 1957.
Description.
The V-1000 was an all-metal jet-powered airliner of conventional layout, which in overall terms looked like a de Havilland Comet with a new fuselage or the Valiant. The fuselage section looks similar to any modern "narrow body" airliner, although the nose was a rounded ogive similar to the Comet's (a design note also copied on the Sud Aviation Caravelle). Although it may have looked similar, the V-1000/VC7 was designed for a six-abreast layout, and thus had a much larger diameter than the Comet.
The wing planform was largely that of the Valiant with engines embedded in the wing near the wing-root, which decreased drag but increased difficulty in maintenance and was later considered to increase the risk of fire. Later designs universally used podded-engines on pylons to address these concerns. The wing shared a number of design notes from the Vickers Valiant bomber. The tail surfaces were conventional, although the horizontal stabilizers had a pronounced dihedral to keep them clear of the jet exhaust.
The aircraft was designed from the start to mount the Rolls-Royce Conway engine, the world's first turbofan. The in-wing mounting dramatically limited the amount of bypass air, however, to about 25%. There are reports of a follow-on design, the V-1001, which would used under-wing podded engines instead.
Some of the design notes of the VC7 would go on to influence the Vickers VC10. In particular, the wing arrangement with the various high-lift devices proved useful in the "hot and high" roles the VC10 would later fill. Additionally, the VC10 was powered by the Conway, albeit in a higher-powered version with much greater bypass ratio.

Tart Abbey

Tart Abbey, also Le Tart Abbey, was the first nunnery of the Cistercian movement. It was located in the present commune of Tart-l'Abbaye in Burgundy (Côte-d'Or), near Genlis, on the banks of the River Ouche and only a few miles away from Cîteaux Abbey, the Cistercian mother house. The community moved to Dijon in 1623, and the abbey buildings in Tart were destroyed by war shortly afterwards; only ruins remain.
History.
Tart.
Foundation and first century.
The foundation charter of Tart Abbey is dated 1132, although the deed mentions three previous gifts from 1125. The founder was Arnoul Cornu, lord of Tart-le-Haut, and his wife Emeline, and their gift consisted of the land of Tart, the tithes of Rouvres and Tart-la-Ville and the grange of Marmot.
It seems clear that the creation of this community was the result of a lengthy series of transactions, which may have begun in about 1120, involving not only Arnoul but the lord of Vergy (his overlord); Josserand de Brancion, Bishop of Langres; the family of Hugh II, Duke of Burgundy; the cathedral chapter of Langres; and Stephen Harding, abbot of the nearby Cîteaux Abbey.
The first abbess was Elizabeth de Vergy, widow of Humbert de Mailly, lord of Faverney or Fauverney, daughter of Savary de Donzy, Count of Chalon-sur-Saône. She was previously a novice in a Benedictine nunnery, Jully Abbey or Priory, at Jully-les-Nonnains, from where the new foundation at Tart was settled. She remained its head for the next 40 years.
Pope Eugene III put the abbey under Papal protection by a bull of 1147, confirmed by his successors.
Thanks to its support from the upper echelons of society, if not to more popular appeal, the abbey received sufficient endowments to ensure its financial stability through the difficult times to come. Its lands included several vineyards, and the sale of wine was a significant element in the abbey's economy: five hectares of the "Vignoble de Bourgogne", others located at Beaune, Chambolle-Musigny, Morey-Saint-Denis, Chézeaux and Vosne-Romanée. Physical labour in the fields and vineyards was regarded as too strenuous for female religious, and the work was undertaken by lay brothers from Cîteaux. These were often in short supply, and the nuns were obliged to hire day-labourers to make up the shortfall.
The abbot of Cîteaux also oversaw the spiritual discipline of the nunnery and was responsible for the appointment of the abbess, who was not elected by the community, as was the practice elsewhere. Tart soon became the head of the female branch of the Cistercians, and was directly responsible for the foundation of many further nunneries in France
and more in Spain.
By the end of the 13th century, when the supply of gifts was drying up, the abbey had amassed sufficient wealth, mostly in the form of land, and gained sufficient ability to manage it, to secure their future through the hardships to come, of which there were many: the Hundred Years' War, the "Grandes Compagnies" and the "Écorcheurs", and the epidemics and calamities that these brought with them, lasted more or less right up to the start of the French Wars of Religion.
Decadence and reform.
For the first century of its existence, under the close supervision of the mother house at Cîteaux, Tart Abbey maintained very high standards of devotion and rigour, which assured its predominant position at the head of the women's houses of the Cistercian Order. After that, however, a decline began to set in, brought about partly by deteriorating external conditions - wars, famine, pestilence, economic crisis and so on - but also by the tendency, which affected most if not all medieval women's religious foundations, for wealthy and influential families to use them as secure accommodation for their unmarried and widowed female relatives. Such women were by no means always inclined to the religious life, and their presence in any numbers inevitably affected a community's spiritual practice and discipline for the worse. By the 16th century the abbey was in a state of advanced decadence and moral collapse, which neither bishops nor popes were able to remedy, and was notorious for its worldly life and sexual impropriety.
In 1617, however, Jeanne-Françoise de Courcelles de Pourlan (b. 1591), who had been educated as a girl at Tart, returned as abbess, with a strong determination to bring about the required reform. Despite the great resistance of the rest of the community, she found a powerful ally in Sébastien Zamet, Bishop of Langres. Opposition to the reform, inside and outside the nunnery, was so great that there was an attempt on the bishop's life. Eventually they decided that reform was impossible as long as the community remained in the abbey at Tart, and that the only way to bring it about was to transfer the nunnery into Dijon, on the basis that in a town it was far easier to maintain seclusion and the discipline of the spiritual life. 
Accordingly, those of the community who were willing to accept the new and stricter life - five, plus two novices - moved to Dijon on 24 May 1623.
Dijon.
The first few years in Dijon were not comfortable. There were long delays in preparing suitable premises, made longer by the severe reduction in the income of the community in Dijon that resulted when in 1636 the troops of Matthias Gallas sacked and burnt the abbey buildings at Tart in the course of the Thirty Years' War, except for an isolated chapel.
After the election of an opponent of the reform, Pierre Nivelle, as abbot of Cîteaux, Jeanne de Pourlan (who had taken the religious name of Jeanne de Saint Joseph) put herself under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Langres. At the same time she changed the previous system, whereby the abbot of Cîteaux had directly nominated the abbess, to a three-yearly election by the nuns.
The community was dissolved during the French Revolution. The buildings after passing through a number of uses are now a museum of Burgundian life, the "Musée Perrin de Puycousin", and the former church is now the Dijon Museum of Sacred Art ("Musée d'art sacré de Dijon").

Hipólito Vieytes

Juan Hipólito Vieytes (San Antonio de Areco, Buenos Aires Province, 6 August 1762 – San Fernando, Argentina, 5 October 1815), was an Argentine merchant and soldier. He was the son of Juan Vieytes and Petrona Mora Fernández de Agüero. His family's house was at 133 Calle Real (today's Ruiz de Arellano street) in front of the central square.
Biography.
When still a young child, his family moved to Buenos Aires and enrolled him and his brother at the Jesuit school "Colegio Real de San Carlos".
He married Josefa Torres and adopted two children: Carlota Joaquina and José Benjamín (his son studied medicine and became a doctor in 1827).
Vieytes started as a successful businessman, in a soap factory in partnership with Nicolás Rodríguez Peña. There he began to get involved in politics and used the business as a meeting place for the conspirators before the May Revolution (1810), with other prominent citizens, all members of the "Patriotic Society" (""Sociedad Patriótica""), (Belgrano, Castelli, Moreno, Paso and French).
He was also a newspaperman and founded the second newspaper published in Buenos Aires, the ""Semanario de agricultura, industria y comercio"" ("Weekly news on agriculture, industry and commerce").
He played a part in the reconquest of Buenos Aires, during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, where he attained the rank of captain. In 1810 he supported the May Revolution and assisted the Cabildo. He was named war auditor, but was later removed when he declined to take part in the execution of Santiago de Liniers. After the death of Mariano Moreno, he replaced him as secretary to the Primera Junta, until 1811.
Conmemoration.
Today, there are streets and schools named in his honor in Buenos Aires and in his hometown of San Antonio de Areco.
In popular culture.
Hipólito Vieytes is the subject of the book Vieytes, el Desterrado, wrote by Francisco Suárez in 2001. Despite not being a real autobiography, the book is written in first-person narrative, and shows the investigations made by Suárez.

American-Hawaiian Steamship Company

The American-Hawaiian Steamship Company was founded in 1899 to carry cargos of sugar from Hawaii to the United States and manufactured goods back to Hawaii. Brothers-in-law George Dearborn and Lewis Henry Lapham were the key players in the founding of the company.
At the time of the company's founding, its steamships sailed around South America via the Straits of Magellan to reach the East Coast ports. By 1907, the company began using the Isthmus of Tehuantepec Route. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. When American political troubles with Mexico closed that route, American-Hawaiian returned to the Straits of Magellan route.
When the Panama Canal opened for traffic in August 1914, American-Hawaiian began routing all of its ships via this route. The temporary closure of the canal because of a series of landslides forced the company to return to the Straits of Magellan route for the third time in its history.
During World War I, twelve of the company's ships were commissioned into the United States Navy; a further five were sunk by submarines or mines during the conflict.
Roger Dearborn Lapham, a future mayor of San Francisco, California, served as company president in the mid-1920s.
During World War II, the company operated many Liberty ships and Victory ships under the War Shipping Administration, including the "Daniel Boone", the "John Milledge", the "John Drake Sloat", the "Benjamin Goodhue" and the "Chanute Victory".

FS Class E.403

E.403 is a class of electric locomotives to be used on fast freight trains by the Italian railway company FS Trenitalia. It is designed and manufactured in Italy by AnsaldoBreda.
History.
In the early 2000s Trenitalia developed plans to expand its freight operations into mainland Europe, especially on the Italy-Austria-Germany corridor. A new locomotive had to be conceived for the plans to become reality, and was originally designated E.402C. It was a further evolution of the E.402B locomotive, with additional equipment to operate in these countries and substantially different Hembot bogies. The locomotives would originally be delivered between 2004 and 2006.
The programme started to suffer major blows: as AnsaldoBreda built this locomotive series exclusively for Trenitalia, on a non-standard platform (unlike the TRAXX and EuroSprinter locomotives which share standard components) the costs were exploding. The locomotive was downsized with the removal of the 1.5 kV and 15 kV parts and French, German and Austrian safety systems. Instead Trenitalia took 51% of the shares in TXLogistik and sought approval for its E.412 locomotives in Austria and Germany. The (limited) Austrian and German approval was given in 2006, with TXLogistik drivers operating the trains in Austria and Germany.
The E.402C programme was renamed E.403 in 2005, with its characteristics finalised in the same year: the locomotive would now be used on fast freight trains, partly operating on the new high-speed lines. Delivery started in 2006 and approval was planned for 2007. However, by February 2010 no freight train has ever run on HS lines, and the E.403 are not yet entered in regular service. In the early months of 2010 Trenitalia decided to assign these locomotives to the Passenger Division.

Yvonne Gleeson

Yvonne Doyle, previously Gleeson is a fictional character in the Irish soap opera "Fair City". She was originally portrayed by Alex MacDowall (sister of Sarah MacDowall who plays Suzanne Doyle) and subsequently by Ciara O'Callaghan.
About Yvonne.
Yvonne arrived in Carrigstown in 1991. She is Mike's widow and was the show's former female antagonist. After spending a few years in London to live with her sister Helen, Yvonne arrived in Carrigstown and began a relationship with Mike Gleeson. She was always very domineering, ordering Mike around in an effort to move up in the world. This has seemingly caused her personality to rub off on her husband, as he now is very snobby. Making money was Yvonne's favourite hobby, but she eventually found herself alone with no one to talk to. This resulted in Yvnone attempting to commit suicide at Christmas. Mike found the drugged Yvonne and took her to hospital. Yvonne vowed to be a good person from then on, but she soon went back to her old ways. Acquiring a partnership in both the Bistro and Rainbows Café, Yvonne became powermad, wanting everything to be done her way. With Mike turning into a boring husband, Yvonne began an affair with Richard. This resulted in Yvonne becoming pregnant with Richard's child. While in a car with a drunken Richard, Yvonne watched in horror as he knocked down a child. The two of them ran away, but the child's mother recognized her. Yvonne and Richard subsequently fled the country, with Yvonne returning to Australia. She then lived there with her baby son.
On 2 September 2008, Yvonne returned to Ireland for Mike's funeral from Australia entering wearing a hat and started an argument with Geraldine at Mike's graveside. She irritated Mike's former girlfriend Geraldine Fahey and told Bela and Suzanne that she was back to hear Mike's will. Eventually Yvonne got her share of the business as she bought it off Mike's brother who had been given shares in the will. Yvonne then became ruthless towards her family as she was caring for her mun Rita who had a stroke and Yvonne left the Doyle household and Rita collapsed after her being so uncaring by leaving her home on her own. Bela then threw Yvonne out after she said Rita was better off being dead or being left in a home.
In early 2010, it was revealed that Yvonne was bisexual. Her girlfriend (Connie) from Australia arrived in early 2010. Yvonne and Connie were to be married in Northern Ireland in summer 2010. When Yvonne gave birth to her child Ruth from which she had with Paul Connie left for Australia as Yvonne was going to put the baby up for adoption. In May 2010, Yvonne left Carrigstown and left Ruth with Niamh, Paul's wife. She had slept with Paul behind Connie's back in September 2009. Her son Stephen, fathered by her former partner Richard, is in care as a result of her drug abuse.
In January 2013, Yvonne shocked her family when she spoke at the funeral of her mother Rita, informing the mourners how ashamed her mother would be of her bickering family.

Tatton Old Hall

Tatton Old Hall is a historic building in Tatton Park near Knutsford, Cheshire, England. It is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building which is owned by the National Trust and administered in conjunction with Cheshire East Council. Its site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.
History.
The hall stands on a site near the village of Tatton, which has since disappeared. It was built as a manor house around the start of the 15th century by either the Stanley family or Sir Richard Brereton. By 1585 a two-storey wing had been added at a right angle to the original house by Sir Thomas Egerton, Lord Chancellor of England. In the 1770s a new hall was built on the site of the present Tatton Hall and the old hall was used as a farmhouse and then a century later converted into three estate cottages. It remained in the possession of the Egerton family until 1958 when it was given to the National Trust.
Architecture.
The hall is built in red brick with a stone slate roof. It was originally timber-framed, but this was replaced by brick in the late 17th or early 18th century. The hall is L-shaped and externally appears to have two storeys. Internally the floors which were added to the older hall have been removed, exposing the complex wooden roof. This has a carved wall plate, carved beams and three tiers of quatrefoil wind braces. The hall contains a gallery which was added in the 20th century. The newer wing retains its two floors and is divided into separate rooms.
Cruck barn.
In the grounds of the hall is a cruck barn dating from the beginning of the 17th century which was originally in a farm at Frodsham, Cheshire. In a dilapidated state, it was removed from its original site in 1976 and rebuilt and restored at Tatton. The barn is long and contains four crucks on sandstone plinths. The long walls of the barn are timber-framed with brick infill on a stone base and the short sides are in plain brick. The roof is thatched in Norfolk reed with sedge on the ridge. On the southeast front are two double doors and one single door; on the northwest front is one single door. Internally, cambered ties have been inserted between the crucks. The barn is listed at Grade II.
Present use.
The hall and barn are open on advertised days for escorted tours, and group or educational visits can be arranged. Historical re-enactments are organised on the site, which may have a medieval theme.

A Wednesday!

A Wednesday! is a 2008 Indian thriller drama film written and directed by Neeraj Pandey. It stars Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher in the lead roles. Set between 2 pm to 6 pm on a Wednesday, the film depicts an about-to-retire police commissioner(Anupam Kher) narrating a sequence of events that unfolded on a particular Wednesday. They do not exist in any written record, only in his mind and in those of several individuals who were involved, willingly and unwillingly, and how those events affected the lives of all the concerned people. It was remade in Tamil as "Unnaipol Oruvan" and Telugu as "Eeenadu", with Kamal Hassan donning the role played by Naseeruddin Shah in the original and Mohanlal and Victory Venkatesh playing the role acted by Anupam Kher in the original in Tamil and Telugu respectively. A Common Man is the official remake in English starring Ben Kingsley and Ben Cross.
The film, made at a small budget, was a sleeper hit at the box office grossing over Rs. 340 million worldwide. Despite its low hype, it was a box office success due to critical acclaim and positive word-of-mouth. Box Office India declared it a hit. Critics credited the movie for its effective storyline and its twist ending. Subsequently, it won a number of awards including the Indira Gandhi Award for Best First Film of a Director at the 56th National Film Awards.
Plot.
"A Wednesday!" opens with Mumbai police commissioner Prakash Rathod (Anupam Kher) resting after a jog, describing in a voice-over that he is going to retire the following day. He goes on to describe the most challenging case he faced in his career.
The film switches into a narrative, showing the events that occurred on a certain Wednesday. An unnamed man (Naseeruddin Shah) carries a travel bag, assumed to contain explosives, in the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station and proceeds to hide the bag in the restroom of a police station near the Mumbai Police headquarters. He then arrives on the rooftop of a building under construction where he has set up his base of operations, equipped with several sim cards, mobile phones and other gadgets. He calls Rathod and informs him that he has placed five bombs in locations throughout Mumbai and has programmed them to explode simultaneously within four hours unless the Commissioner gives in to his demands and releases four militants. In response, Rathod immediately alerts his team involved in intelligence research and surveillance, tapping all the available resources to trace the location of the caller. Meanwhile, the caller tips off television news reporter Naina Roy (Deepal Shaw), telling her to reach the police headquarters immediately as it is going to be "the most important day of her life". Rathod initially suspects the anonymous caller is bluffing, but his doubts are dispelled as the caller, to prove his seriousness and the police force's helplessness, reveals that a bomb has been planted in the police station right across the Police headquarters. He further scares them by calling the cell phone attached to the bomb but does not detonate the bomb. Just then Roy reaches the scene on the caller's instructions and reports about the situation.
As Rathod and his team desperately try to locate the caller, the four militants demanded by the caller are rounded up by police officers Arif (Jimmy Shergill) and Jai (Aamir Bashir). The caller then asks the two police officers to leave the four militants near a bench on an airport runway, but Arif leaves only three militants behind and takes one of them captive as he suspects that the caller would not reveal the locations of the bombs even after the militants are released.
A phone placed under the bench rings once Arif and Jai are several feet away and an explosion occurs in which the three terrorists perish. Arif relays this information to Rathod, and the anonymous caller reveals he does not belong to any terrorist organization, and his plan was not to free the terrorists but to kill them. The caller sought to avenge all the terrorist attacks they had helped carry out in Mumbai and other major cities of India, specifically the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. His final demand is that the officers kill the fourth militant themselves or he would set off all five bombs in Mumbai. In response, Rathod orders Arif and Jai to kill the fourth militant.
After the death of the fourth militant is confirmed on the news, the caller calls Rathod for a final time to reveal that he had not planted any other bombs in the city. At this point, Rathod surprisingly declares he already knew there were no more bombs, hence his decision to kill the last terrorist was not taken in fear but in confidence. Rathod reaches the caller's location just as the latter is leaving the place, having destroyed all his gadgets and equipment. The two meet briefly when Rathod, identifying the anonymous caller on the basis of a face sketch, offers the man a ride home and introduces himself. The film freezes momentarily just as the man begins to smile and utter his name, when Rathod's voice-over cuts back and he says the man told him his real name but he does not wish to reveal it since doing so would give away the man's religion. The film ends on an idealistic note, with Rathod admitting that he knew the common man was disturbed because of the insecure environment and the incompetence of the governing authorities, but he never imagined a common man would go to such lengths to achieve this end. He also notes that the facts of this incident cannot be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it, and further acknowledges that although the incident has ambiguous moral significance, he personally feels that whatever happened, happened for the best.
Development.
Though a work of fiction, the script was inspired by the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings. In fact, the incidents that followed the bombings were used as details in the plot.
After finishing the script, Pandey sent it to Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah, who were his only choice for the two principal characters. Once both accepted the roles, he approached producer Anjum Rizvi who liked the subject and the casting. Meanwhile UTV Motion Pictures heard of the project, took it on, and bought the film’s rights from Rizvi and Pandey.
Production.
From casting to completion, "A Wednesday!" took about eight months. It was filmed on location around Mumbai in 28 days. The terrorist's ‘workstation’ was an actual under-construction 25-story building; it was chosen from 50 other such buildings for its clear view of the Mumbai skyline. Since the building had no elevators, a trolley lift was installed; Shah walked up the 25 floors every day.
Release.
The release was delayed as UTV own production "Mumbai Meri Jaan" (2008), also based on the Mumbai train serial blasts, was scheduled for an August release. "Wednesday!" was released in September alongside "Hijack" and Santosh Sivan's "Tahaan".
Reception.
"A Wednesday!" received positive reviews with many comparing it to the movies of the "Die Hard" series. In a "Tehelka" review, while commending Neera Pandey for a tightly scripted film, "red herrings, finely etched characters", also noted "(for the film), the real Anupam Kher, whom we met in "Saransh", and the real Naseeruddin Shah, whom we knew from "Bazaar" and "Mandi" and "Sparsh", both show up." "The Times of India" 's critic Nikhat Kazmi called the movie "an intelligent diatribe against terrorism, refreshingly packaged as a racy thriller, reminiscent of the Die Hard Series." Rony D'Costa of Box Office India gave it 3 stars out of 5, stating "it will take just 100 minutes of your time but will give you an exciting & enriching movie going experience. A good watch, any day of the week."
Noted critic Rajeev Masand of "CNN-IBN" gave 4 out of 5 stars, and a positive review saying that "it's difficult to explain just how good A Wednesday is without giving away too much about the film. Because believe me, it's a film best seen without any impressions. It's a film whose charm lies in its unraveling". "The Economic Times"'s critic Gaurav Malani wrote that "A Wednesday is one of those rare variety films about which one can't discuss much despite a strong desire for it could hamper your viewing experience as an unappraised audience. It's a film one wants to rave liberally about but even then you can't conveniently converse on the instances of acclaim since those are the moments of surreptitious surprise held in reserve by the director. It's the kind of film that is discussed in detail once it acquires the cult status.", also giving it 4 stars out of 5.
Anupama Chopra of NDTV thought the film to be a "provocative theatre. Its message is urgent and relevant but also disturbing and dangerous." She also felt what it suggested was "implausible".
Boxoffice.
"A Wednesday!" net grossed around Rs 120 million in India. The film had a distributor share of Rs 4.46 crore in India. It gave satisfying results to the producers, distributors and exhibitors.
Prequel.
On 14 April 2009, it was announced that a prequel for "A Wednesday!" was being planned by the film makers. Employing the same cast, it is to be directed by Pandey's assistant. As UTV owns the rights to the title, an alternative would be chosen, as it being produced by Neeraj Pandey.
Remakes.
The film was remade into Tamil/Telugu starring Kamal Haasan and Mohanlal/Venkatesh in primary roles.
In Telugu it was remade as "Eeenadu" (2009) and in Tamil it was remade as "Unnaipol Oruvan" (2009). UTV sold the rights of the film to Asia Media and Gemini Media, which remade it into "A Common Man", starring Ben Kingsley and Ben Cross.

Minuscule 2814

Minuscule 2814 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), Aν20 (Soden). Formerly it was labelled as 1rK in all catalogues, but it was renumbered as a 2814 by Aland. It is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, dated palaeographically to the 12th century.
Description.
The codex contains the Book of Revelation with a commentary of Andreas from Caesarea. Last six verses were lost (22:16-21). The text is written on a parchment in minuscule, in 1 column per page, 20 lines per page. 
The Greek text of the Gospels is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Aland placed it in Category V.
History of the codex.
This codex was chiefly used by Desiderius Erasmus as a basis for his first edition of the Novum Testamentum (1516). It was the only Greek manuscript of the Book of Revelation used by Erasmus. Erasmus translated the missing last six verses from the Vulgate back to Greek for his editions. In result its readings and his translation became a basis for the Textus Receptus.
Erasmus borrowed the manuscript from Reuchlin, but it was lost for many years until rediscovered in 1861 by Franz Delitzsch. 
The manuscript was included to a critical apparatus by Kurt Aland in his 25th edition of Novum Testamentum Graece (1963).
The codex was located in Harburg (Öttingen-Wallersteinsche Bibliothek), and was transferred together with the whole library to the library of University of Augsburg (I, 1, 4 (0), 1).

AVCA Showcase

The AVCA Showcase, established by the American Volleyball Coaches Association, is an annual NCAA volleyball tournament that is held at the start of each fall season. In the old format, four teams, usually ranked in the top 15, compete for the showcase title. In the new format, it was changed to a conference challenge.
The tournament was founded in 1995, and ten times, the showcase champion has made the NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship final four, with the team winning the national championship twice.
Prior to 2005, it was called the "State Farm/NACWAA Classic". At the start of 2008, Runza Restaurants started sponsoring, thus the name becoming "Runza/AVCA Showcase".
History.
As of 2007, the showcase champion went on to the NCAA Final Four 10 times out of 13. The only time the winner failed to advance to the Final Four was Colorado State in 2000, Texas in 2006 and Nebraska in 2007. However, only twice has the showcase champion won the NCAA Championship: Long Beach State in 1998 and Southern California in 2003. Ironically, those two schools both had undefeated records en route to the NCAA title. The only other school to go undefeated in the NCAA era (since 1981) was Nebraska in 2000.
The following table lists the past winners, runners-up, city the tournament is hosted in, and the Most Valuable Player.
Old format.
Prior to 2008, the showcase was done with four teams, with the winners of the first match playing for the championship and the losers playing for third place in the consolation match.
New format.
In 2008, the AVCA announced that the showcase would take on a new format. Instead of four teams competing in a tradition 1st–4th place tournament, it would be two teams from an athletic conference taking on two teams from another athletic conference. The two teams from the same conference do not play each other. The tournament will be held in Omaha, Nebraska at the Qwest Center through 2010.
Other teams.
The following is a list of teams that participated, but never won or finished as runners-up in the tournament.

II Corps (Pakistan)

The II Corps, known as II Strike Corps or Army Reserve South, is army corps of Pakistan Army stationed in Multan, Punjab Province of Pakistan. The II Strike Corps is one of Pakistan's four heavy armoured corps. Also known as Army Reserve South, the corps is currently active in Pakistan's theater in War on Terror where its administrative divisions and brigades led numerous operations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. The Corps is currently commanded by 3-star general Lieutenant-General Abid Pervaiz as Corps Commander. The Corps longest-serving Commander was then Lieutenant-General Rahimuddin Khan.
History.
II Corps was formed in 1971 as the winds of war began to blow in the sub-continent. It was responsible for the defense of all of Pakistan south of Multan; a huge undertaking, as well as the launching of counterattacks against India itself. As war came its units would be heavily involved in the first task.
1971 War.
The Corps was commanded by Tikka Khan during the war. Controversially one of its divisions; the 18th Infantry Division, was taken out of II Corp's command and sent on an ill-fated offensive towards Ramgarh; which led to the debacle at the Battle of Longewala, the fact it was under GHQ rather than II Corps, spared the corps of any blame, but was latter deemed one of the causes of failure. A major Indian attack towards Umerkot would be defeated by two of the corps divisions; the 18th after its return from Ramgarh and to II Corps command, and the 33rd Infantry Division, a task for which they were commended, after the war. In the final analysis its performance in the war; while commended by many parties, would be controversial, since at no time was its most powerful formation, 1st Armoured Division, committed to action.
War in North-West Pakistan.
As a heavy armour and mechanised formation, it was unsuited for the mountain warfare that characterised the army's commitments over the next three decades in Kashmir, Siachen and Kargil, although it a few units did see action attached to other corps. As Pakistan's main strategic reserve, it was also not sent on overseas operations under the UN and with allies (such as Gulf War I and Somalia) which the army was ordered to undertake.
It would not be until 2008 when the elements of the corps would see action again. As the war in FATA heated up and militant activity increased to a hitherto unseen level, the government responded by launching a massive operation (code-named Operation "Zalzala" meaning earthquake) against the militant strongholds South Waziristan. The operation would be spearheaded by 14th Infantry Division of II Corps, and would succeed in evicting the militants from their stronghold. On December 26, 2008, elements of the 14th Infantry Division, are currently being redeployed to the Indian border.

History.
In May, 1983, Portugal concluded the renegotiation of the contract for the purchase of ex-USN A-7 Corsair II aircraft, resulting in a second order of 30 Corsair II (24 A-7P and six TA-7P), adding to the 20 A-7P already delivered between 1981 and 1982. Subsequently to this additional purchase the 304 Squadron ""Magníficos"" was activated on October 4, 1984, commanded by Major Botelho da Costa. The primary missions of tactical air support for maritime operations (TASMO) and aerial interdiction (AI), and the secondary missions of defensive and offensive counter air operations (DCA/OCA) were assigned to the squadron upon its creation.
It was disbanded in July, 1999, with the retirement of the A-7P Corsair II fleet in service with the Portuguese Air Force.

RNAS Burscough (HMS Ringtail)

RNAS Burscough (HMS Ringtail) was a Fleet Air Arm (FAA) naval air station which was situated 1.5 statute miles south-west of Burscough, Lancashire. The Admiralty acquired of land in December 1942 and the airfield was built with four runways and several hangars, being commissioned on 1 September 1943.
Operational history.
The air station was planned to accommodate FAA day, night and torpedo fighter squadrons for their formation, training and working-up. Many FAA squadrons were based at Burscough for a period of a few weeks or months, before moving to front-line FAA bases or on to aircraft carriers for deployment in action in the European or Far Eastern war fronts.
One of the first FAA units to operate from HMS Ringtail was 809 Squadron FAA, equipped with Supermarine Seafires, it arrived from RAF Andover on 19 December 1943, then departed on 29 December when it flew its aircraft aboard the aircraft carrier HMS Stalker.
Postwar operations.
RNAS Burscough closed for flying in May 1946. Thereafter, the hangars were used for the storage of aircraft engines and other FAA equipment, under the direction of RNAS Stretton, until both airfields was disposed of in 1957.
During the 1960s, civil cropduster agricultural aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters, used the now otherwise inactive airfield as an operating base for refuelling and filling the aircraft's spray tanks.
As of early 2009, four naval hangars still survive in use for non-aviation purposes, and were used by the Merseyside Transport Trust, from the late 1970s until January 2012, when the charity moved to new premises within the industrial estate. The four hangars now stand empty and unused. These four hangars include 'Pentad' type hangars, and are located on the western edge of the old airfield.

<doc id="19076796" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19076796" title="Teledermatology">
Teledermatology

Teledermatology is a subspecialty in the medical field of dermatology and probably one of the most common applications of telemedicine and e-health. In teledermatology, telecommunication technologies are used to exchange medical information (concerning skin conditions and tumours of the skin) over a distance using audio, visual and data communication. Applications comprise health care management such as diagnoses, consultation and treatment as well as (continuous) education.
The dermatologists Perednia and Brown were the first to coin the term “teledermatology” in 1995. In a scientific publication, they described the value of a teledermatologic service in a rural area underserved by dermatologists.
Modes of data transmission.
Teledermatology (as telemedicine) is practised on the basis of two concepts: Store and forward (SAF) and real time/live interactive teledermatology. Hybrid modes also exist (combining SAF and real time applications).
The SAF method is most commonly used in teledermatology: It involves sending (forwarding) digital images associated with (anonymous) medical information to the data storage unit of a consulted specialist. It can be as easy as sending an email with a digital image of a lesion to seek advice for a skin condition. Advantages of this method are that it does not demand the presence of both parties at the same time and does not usually require expensive equipment. 
In real-time/ live interactive teledermatology applications, provider and individuals usually interact via live videoconferencing. It may also involve remote surgery and the use of telerobotic microscopes in dermatopathology. This mode generally requires more sophisticated and costly technology than used in the SAF mode. Both participants must be available at the same time.
Areas of application.
Health care management.
Telemedicine developed by Remote meeting Technologies (RMT) substantially reduces the cost of Telediagnosis and telecommunication. Remote Meeting Technologies’ real-time, full-HD telepathology solution benefits everyone involved. From the pathologists who do the work, to administrators who pay the bills, to the IT department maintaining security and reliability and most of all the patients, whose well-being is the ultimate concern. RMT currently delivers real time solutions to many medical facilities throughout the United States and Canada. Remote Meeting Technologies, true high-definition, brilliant color, high-definition video allows pathology for both gross and microscopic imaging. True 1920 x 1080p resolution is shared realtime over standard networks. The next generation of diagnostics is now being provided world wide.
Health care management.
Direct consultation involves an individual with a skin condition contacting a dermatologist via telecommunication to request diagnosis and treatment. In this field, mobile applications of teledermatology gain importance.
Telediagnosis in the absence of personal contact with health care workers to the individual is complex. It requires active participation of the individual and without appropriate guidance may lead to improper management. However, as a triage tool, leading the individual directly to the appropriate specialist for his/her disease, it could be very valuable in the near future. 
Specialist referral is a major area of application in teledermatology A general practitioner (or other medical professional) that sees the individual consults a specialist/ specialised centre via telecommunication in order to get a second opinion. The specialist then helps the GP in rendering a diagnosis, providing management options et cetera.
Home telehealth/telehomecare involves an individual with a chronic condition being examined and managed remotely at home. An important field of interest of telehomecare in dermatology is the follow-up treatment of individuals with skin conditions requiring regular follow-up such as crural ulcers. Crural ulcers are a common skin condition that needs follow up visits up to twice a week demanding significant time commitments by the individuals in addition to causing a financial burden on the health care system. Teledermatology can help to reduce the time and costs involved in the follow-up of such conditions.
Education and information.
Medical education/continuous education are a major advantage of telemedicine/e-health. Numerous universities offer online courses, computer based training and Web applications in this field principally aimed at medical students. Specialist training courses via internet are also available, particularly in dermoscopy.
General medical/health information may be accessed by non-professionals, such as individuals affected by a skin condition, and their relatives, through the internet. They are also able to join peer support groups with others affected by the same condition.
Domains with special interest.
Teledermoscopy.
In teledermoscopy, digital dermoscopic lesion images (with or without clinical images) are transmitted electronically to a specialist for examination. This can be done on the web-based telediagnostic network Campus Medicus
Dermoscopy (dermatoscopy, epiluminescence microscopy) is the technical field of using an epiluminescence microscope for viewing skin lesions in magnification in-vivo. It is particularly useful in the early detection of malignant skin lesions (i.e., melanoma). Digital dermoscopic images can be taken with a digital camera attached to a dermatoscope or special video cameras suited for dermoscopy, e.g. the FotoFinder. Since dermoscopy is based on examination of a two-dimensional image it is very well suited for digital imaging and teledermatology.
Teledermatopathology.
Teledermatopathology is the transmission of dermatopathologic images either in real-time with the aid of a robotic microscope or using a store-and-forward system (transmission as a single file). In the latter method (SAF) a rather new development is the introduction of virtual slide systems (VSS).
Virtual slides are made by digitally scanning an entire glass slide at a high resolution and then sending the images to a storage system. These can be then assessed on a computer screen similar to conventional microscopy, allowing the pathologist to maneuver around the image and view every part of the slide at any magnification.
Teledermoscopically-aided dermatopathology.
This is the transmission of crucial medical data and dermoscopic as well as clinical images to a pathologist who renders the conventional histopathologic diagnosis. 
In the everyday clinical setting, skin biopsies are taken by the physician directly responsible for the individual and are assessed by a dermatopathologist. This pathologist has most likely never seen the clinical aspect of the lesion and might not have any information about the person. These limitations can be overcome by teledermoscopically-aided dermatopathology whereby a patient history and clinical data may increase the sensitivity of diagnosis. 
Additionally it has been shown that provision of such data may improve the level of diagnostic confidence held by the assessing dermatopathologists.
Mobile Teledermatology.
Mobile telemedicine is a system in which at least one participant (the person seeking advice or the doctor, for instance) uses wireless or mobile equipment (i.e. mobile phones, handheld devices), in contrast to conventional stationary telemedicine platforms. Travellers who develop skin lesions as well as doctors who are on the move in hospital/non-hospital area can benefit from this new development in teledermatology. In order to facilitate access to medical advice and enable individuals to play a more active role in managing their own health status, mobile teledermatology seems to be especially suited for patient filtering or triage. (i.e. referral based on the severity and character of their skin condition). Another possible practical application is for follow-up of individuals with chronic skin conditions.
Suitability of cases for Teledermatology.
Not all cases are suitable for teledermatology.The type of cases suited for teledermatology is a topic, which requires more studies. Some studies have observed that eczema and follicular lesions were diagnosed with relatively more certainty,while in some other studies it was seen that diagnoses were made with more certainty in cases like viral warts, herpes zoster, acne vulgaris, irritant dermatitis, vitiligo, and superficial bacterial and fungal infections. Unlike in western studies where pigmented lesions suspicious of melanomas are one of the most referred cases for teledermatology (with or without teledermatoscopy), Asian studies have fewer cases referred based on the suspicion of melanoma.

TeamViewer

TeamViewer is a proprietary computer software package for remote control, desktop sharing, online meetings, web conferencing and file transfer between computers. The software operates with the Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS, Android, Windows RT and Windows Phone operating systems. It is also possible to access a machine running TeamViewer with a web browser. While the main focus of the application is remote control of computers, collaboration and presentation features are included.
TeamViewer GmbH was founded in 2005 in Uhingen, Germany. TeamViewer is a unified partner with GFI.
Establishing connections.
TeamViewer may be installed with an installation procedure, although the 'Quick Support' version will run without installation. To connect to another computer, TeamViewer has to be running on both machines. To install TeamViewer, administrator access is required, but once installed it can be run by any user. When TeamViewer is started on a computer, it generates a partner ID and password (user-defined passwords are also supported). To establish a connection from a local client to a remote host machine, the local operator must communicate with the remote operator, request the ID and password, and then enter these into the local TeamViewer.
To start an online meeting, the presenter gives the Meeting ID to the participants. They join the meeting by using the TeamViewer full version or by logging on to http://go.teamviewer.com/ and enter the Meeting ID.
It is also possible to schedule a meeting in advance.
Security.
TeamViewer uses RSA private/public key exchange (2048-bit) and AES (256-bit) session encryption.
In the default configuration, TeamViewer uses one of the servers of TeamViewer.com to start the connection and the routing of traffic between the local client and the remote host machine. The software then determines how to establish a connection. In 70% of the cases, after the handshake a direct connection via UDP or TCP is established; the other connections are routed through TeamViewer GmbH's router network (via TCP or http-tunneling).

James Q. Miller

James Q. Miller MD (1926 – May 15, 2005) was an American neurologist and educator in neurology based at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.
Early life and education.
He was born James Quinter Miller in Ohio. His undergraduate education was at Haverford College near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and his medical degree from the Columbia in New York City. He was one of the first neurology residents at the Department of Neurology of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. He received additional training in neuropathology, genetics, and child neurology at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. He enlisted in the Air Force and served as a physician at the base in Newfoundland, Canada.
Clinical Practice and Research.
In 1962 he was hired as a faculty neurologist at the University of Virginia.
He established the first cytogenetics laboratory in Virginia. In this capacity, he established statewide screening programs for sickle cell disease and heritable neurological disease. One of his early papers was his description of two siblings with lissencephaly, now known by the eponym Miller-Dieker syndrome.
Although his main early interests were in neurogenetics and inflammatory diseases of the nervous system, he maintained activities in most of the subspecialty fields of neurology. In collaboration with his colleague Fritz E. Dreifuss, he helped maintain a system of field clinics administered by the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Child Neurology Program. Although the emphasis was on epilepsy, patients with a wide range of neurological disorders were served. Three Appalachian field clinics in Tazewell, Wise, and Bristol, Virginia continue to be staffed by University of Virginia neurologists.
He established one of the early comprehensive multiple sclerosis programs and was highly active in promoting research and participating in regional and national support groups and educatory efforts for multiple sclerosis patients. In his honor, the current multiple sclerosis program at the University of Virginia is entitled the “James Q. Miller Center for Multiple Sclerosis”.

Superstar Ice Hockey

Superstar Ice Hockey is a hockey sport game published by Mindscape in 1987.
Summary.
Gameplay allows for players to choose from either the centre or goalie positions, a 2 player option allows for head to head play or co-operative play where one player is the centre and the other the goalie. Coaching decisions such as line changes and strategy choices can be made during a game between whistles. Player creation, development and trades all take place before and after games.
Gameplay as a centre was limited due to only having one action button, this meant that when playing as a centre, pressing the "fire" button would cause the player to swing his stick. If the player had possession of the puck this would result in a shot. Swinging the stick with or without the puck also had the potential to knock other players down depending on their proximity to the swinging stick, often resulting in a penalty, if no penalty is called the player knocked down would spin for several seconds before getting back up (if you as the centre were knocked down you were effectively out of the play until you regained your feet).
The game was notable for its player creation and development system, the game used "trade points" as a measure of value when creating new players, trading players and running team practices. The more points spent on an activity, in general the better the result. Players also aged and their skills declined, the most noticeable being speed.

Leopard bush fish

The leopard bush fish ("Ctenopoma acutirostre "), also known as leopard bushfish, spotted ctenopoma, leopard ctenopoma, spotted climbing perch, spotted leaf fish, African leaf fish, spotted cichlid or spotted bushfish, is a freshwater fish. It is part of the unique "Anabantidae" family, that is freshwater fish that originate from South East Asia and Africa, and is therefore related to the Siamese fighting fish ("Betta splendens").
It is relatively common in the aquarium industry and is often sold as a beginners' "oddball" fish.
Habitat.
The leopard bush fish is endemic to the Congo River basin in Africa and has adapted to suit many different biotopes 
within this system from fast flowing streams to stagnant ponds. 
Size.
The leopard bush fish is slow growing and may take several years to reach an adult size which in the wild can easily reach 8 in or 20 cm. However in captivity a fish of 6 in or 15 cm is considered large.
In the aquarium.
In the aquarium the leopard bush fish is often seen as a hardy oddball that fits into most community tanks.
The leopard bush fish in the wild is a predator so it will take small fish up to the general size of an adult female guppy; anything larger than this will for the most part be ignored. It is not generally a good idea to mix this fish with large aggressive cichlids as they may injure the leopard bush fish or out-compete it for food. Good tank mates for the leopard bush fish include all gourami species, bala shark, silver dollar, Corydoras, Plecostomus species, Ancistrus catfish, and anything that won't fit into its mouth. They enjoy lots of space and places to hide, so 55 gallons is acceptable if it is not overstocked and has good filtration.(ctenopoma-acutirostre)
Diet.
In the wild Leopard bush fish will eat any fish or insect that they come across small enough to fit into their mouths. In the aquarium however they will readily learn to accept dead alternatives such as bloodworms (chironomid midge larvae) and some sinking pellets, however that said few learn to accept flake foods and many people prefer to feed them with live food so that they are able to watch the Leopard bush fish's unusual stalking method.

Emory University Hospital Midtown

Emory University Hospital Midtown (originally Emory Crawford Long Hospital) is a 511-bed acute care teaching hospital located in the SoNo district of Atlanta, Georgia, and affiliated with Emory University. The hospital's COO is Dane Peterson. Emory University Hospital Midtown is staffed by more than 1,000 private-practice and Emory Clinic physicians, spanning 28 specialties including cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, neurosciences, general and vascular surgery, internal medicine, urology, obstetrics and gynecology.
Emory’s Midtown hospital celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2008.
The institution’s history dates back to 1908, when two physicians, Dr. Edward Campbell Davis and a former student of his, Dr. Luther C. Fischer, opened the 26-bed Davis-Fischer Sanatorium on Crew Street, near present-day Turner Field. With just 26 beds, the hospital quickly outgrew its capacity and by 1911, Davis and Fischer moved the hospital to its present site, opening an 85-bed Davis-Fischer Sanatorium on Linden Avenue.
In 1931, the hospital was renamed Crawford W. Long Memorial Hospital in honor of Dr. Crawford W. Long, the Georgia physician who discovered sulphuric ether for use as an anesthetic, and was the first doctor to use anesthesia during surgery.
Emory Crawford Long Hospital was renamed "Emory University Hospital Midtown", effective February 13, 2009. However, as part of Emory's commitment to honor a more than 100-year history of the original name, 'Crawford W. Long Memorial Hospital' is retained on exterior monuments.

Direct Metal Mastering

Direct Metal Mastering is a vinyl record manufacturing technology by TELDEC. Records manufactured with this technology are often marked by a "DMM" logo on the outer record sleeve.
The cutting lathe for DMM engraves the audio signal directly onto a copper-plated master disc, instead of engraving the groove into a lacquer-coated aluminum disc. Examination of early DMM discs revealed what appeared to be a high frequency modulation in the groove, thought to be caused by the use of an ultrasonic carrier tone. In fact, there was no carrier tone and the modulation was simply caused by the vibration (squeal) of the cutter head as it was dragged through the copper disc.
There is one drawback of this approach and that is because of the modulation arising from this cutting method, criticisms have arisen of the sound of such 'DMM' records. They are often labelled as bright or edgy.
The Direct Metal Mastering technology addresses the lacquer mastering technology's issue of pre-echoes during record play, caused by the cutting stylus unintentionally transferring some of the subsequent groove wall's impulse signal into the previous groove wall. In particular, a quiet passage followed by a loud sound often clearly revealed a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time (the duration of one revolution at 33 rpm). This problem could also appear as post-echo, 1.8 seconds after a peak in volume.
Another improvement is noise reduction. The lacquer mastering method bears a higher risk of adding unwanted random noise to the recording, caused by the enclosure of small dust particles when spraying the silvering on the lacquer master, which is the necessary first step of the electroplating process for reproduction of the master disc. As the DMM master disc is already made of metal (copper), this step is not required, and its faults are avoided.

Edgar Bonham-Carter

Sir Edgar Bonham-Carter, KCMG, CIE (2 April 1870 – 24 April 1956) was a British barrister and administrator in the Sudan and Iraq. In his younger days he was a rugby player of some note and represented England at international level.
Early life and rugby career.
Bonham-Carter was born in London, the son of Sibella Charlotte (née Norman) and the businessman and lawyer Henry Bonham Carter, and was educated at Clifton College and New College, Oxford, where he took second class honours in jurisprudence in 1892. While at Oxford Bonham-Carter played rugby union for the University team and won two sporting 'Blues' in 1890 and 1891. While still at Oxford he was selected to play for the England national team, in the 1891 Home Nations Championship, against Scotland. This was his only international appearance, but he continued playing rugby after leaving university, joining Blackheath, before turning out for invitational tourists the Barbarians in 1892.
Service in Sudan and Iraq.
Bonham-Carter was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1895 and in 1899 was appointed Legal Secretary of the Sudan.
In Sudan, he had to devise an entirely new legal system, the criminal part of which was largely based on the Indian Penal Code. He held the post, latterly also an Official Member of the Council of the Governor-General of the Sudan, until 1919, when he was appointed Senior Judicial Officer of Mesopotamia (later Iraq), newly under British Mandate after long being a part of the Ottoman Empire. Here he also had to devise a new legal system, adapting the Ottoman system to fit in with modern British ideas of justice, but not imposing too many foreign ideas on the country's longstanding legal system.
While in Iraq, he interested himself in archaeology. At the request of the family of Gertrude Bell he became honorary secretary of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq, which he established on a firm basis. He was chairman of the school until 1950.
Later life.
On his retirement in 1921, he returned to England. He contested the London County Council election in 1922 as a Progressive candidate for Bethnal Green North East and was elected. He served for one three-year term. From 1929 to 1939 he was chairman of First Garden City Ltd, which was responsible for the development of Letchworth and from 1940 to 1942 he was chairman of the National Housing and Town Planning Council. He was also a member of the council of the National Trust, which took up much of his time, and was president of the Commons Preservation Society.
Bonham-Carter was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1909, Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1919, and Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours for his work in Iraq. He was also awarded the Egyptian Order of the Nile 1st Class in 1916.
Bonham-Carter's brothers included General Sir Charles Bonham-Carter and the politician Sir Maurice Bonham Carter, who was the grandfather of the actress Helena Bonham Carter.
