1st Louisiana Native Guard (CSA)

The 1st Louisiana Native Guard (CSA) was a Confederate Louisiana militia of free persons of color formed in 1861 in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was disbanded in February 1862; some of the members joined the Union Army's 1st Louisiana Native Guard regiment (later the 73rd Regiment Infantry U.S. Colored Troops).
Confederate Louisiana militia.
Shortly after Louisiana's secession, Governor Thomas Overton Moore issued pleas for troops on April 17 and April 21, 1861. In response to the governor's request, a committee of ten prominent New Orleans free blacks called a meeting at the Catholic Institute on April 22. About two thousand people attended the meeting where muster lists were opened, with about 1,500 free blacks signing up. Governor Moore accepted the services of these men as part of the state's miltia.
The new militia regiment was formed on May 2, 1861, consisting mostly of free persons of color Creole French Speakers (gens de couleur) between the ages of 15 and 50. At that time, an estimated 10,000 African American residents of the state of Louisiana and the city of New Orleans had gained their freedom. On May 29, 1861, Governor Moore appointed three white officers as commanders of the regiment, and company commanders were appointed from among the free blacks of the regiment.
The militia unit was the first of any North American unit to have African-American officers. This regiment was called the Louisiana Native Guard. Though ten per cent of its members would later join the Union Army's 1st Louisiana Native Guard, the two were separate military units.
Activities.
The South did not use this Confederate Native Guard regiment in any military action, and failed to provide it with uniforms or arms. Most of the men in the unit used their own resources to obtain weapons and uniforms which were displayed in a parade in New Orleans on January 8, 1862. It was largely considered part of the Confederacy's public relations campaign. The Native Guard tried to become known by offering their service to escort Union prisoners, captured from Manassas, through New Orleans. Despite the Confederacy choosing white militiamen instead, the Native Guard still participated in two other grand reviews. The Louisiana State Legislature passed a law in January 1862 that reorganized the militia into only “...free white males capable of bearing arms… ”. 
The 1st Louisiana Native Guard was affected by this law. It was forced to disband on February 15, 1862, when the new law took effect. "Their demise was only temporary, however, for Governor Moore reinstated the Native Guards on March 24 after the Federal navy under Admiral David G. Farragut entered the Mississippi River." 
As the regular Confederate forces under Major General Mansfield Lovell abandoned New Orleans, the Native Guard were left to fend for themselves. The Native Guard were again, and in finality, ordered to disband by General John L. Lewis, of the Louisiana Militia, on April 29, 1862, as the Union troops entered the city to take possession of it. General Lewis cautioned the Native Guard to hide their muskets and dispose of their uniforms before returning home.

Spiritus Sanctus Academies

Spiritus Sanctus Academies is a group of private schools based in southeastern Michigan teaching the Roman Catholic faith and regular classes founded by Thomas Monaghan and run by the Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist. Currently, there are two active schools. One school was built in California, but still is waiting for applications for Transitional Kindergarten & Kindergarten, to be activated in February 2008. One is situated close to Dominos World Resource Center, the headquarters of Domino's Pizza, and the other is located at Plymouth, Michigan.
History.
The Academies were founded by the entrepreneur, Catholic philanthropist, and billionaire Tom Monaghan after his religious awakening. He met with the Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist and collaborated with them to establish the first academy in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Academies grew and started forming schools at Ypsilanti, Michigan, Plymouth, Michigan, and Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Today.
There are now only two school campuses after Tom Monaghan withdrew financial support from the school leaving the Dominican sisters with the school. Each school is receiving about three hundred students. A new school in Granite Bay, California opened in the fall of 2008, started up by a mission of the Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist stationed at California.

Edward Lawrence (Ted) Wheelwright (1921–2007) was a notable Australian economist, radio host and anti-war activist who taught at the University of Sydney from 1952 until 1986. He has written on Australian economic history, often from an institutionalist or Marxian perspective, and his published works have included the analysis of capitalism in Australian history and an analysis of the influence and development of transnational corporations. He authored 11 books independently and 5 with co-editors, and made frequent appearances on ABC Radio's "Notes on the News" program. He is the namesake of a memorial lecture at the University of Sydney and an annual prize in the university's political economy course. While at the University of Sydney, he set up the Transnational Corporations Research Project.
Study of transnational corporations.
Wheelwright was a vocal critic of the influence of transnational corporations in the politics of sovereign countries. Writing in 1982 with G.J. Crough, he argued:
Along with fellow University of Sydney economist Gregory Crough, Ted Wheelwright was one of the founding members and permanent staff of the Transnational Corporations Research Project, set up through the University of Sydney in July 1975. The stated goal of the project was to "provide information on, and initiate research into aspects of foreign investment, and the activities of transnational corporations in Australia." Publications of the project assert three objectives;
Through the project Wheelwright kept a correspondence with the United Nations Information and Research Centre on Transnational Corporations, the Transnational Institute in Washington, and an institute of the same name in Amsterdam. More than forty documents were published by the Transnational Corporations Research Project.

Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747 (1986) was a United States Supreme Court case involving a challenge to Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act of 1982. 
Case facts.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists sought an injunction to all enforcement of the Pennsylvania law. Although the law in question was similar to the one in "City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health", in "Thornburgh" the Reagan administration asked the justices to overrule "Roe v. Wade", a case which Chief Justice Warren Burger had now decided to abandon.
Opinion of the court.
Justice Blackmun's opinion for the court rejected this position, reaffirming "Roe". Justice O'Connor distanced herself from the court in dissent, "disput not only the wisdom but also the legitimacy of the Court's attempt to discredit and pre-empt state abortion regulation regardless of the interests it serves and the impact it has." The 7-2 majority of "Roe" had now shrunk to 5-4.
Aftermath.
Justice Blackmun's opinion in "Thornburgh" emphasized women's rights, rather than the rights of physicians, the emphasis of his opinion in "Roe". He wrote: "Few decisions are more personal and intimate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy, than a woman's decision - with the guidance of her physician and within the limits specified in "Roe" - whether to end her pregnancy. A woman's right to make that choice freely is fundamental."

Matudán mac Muiredaig

Matudán mac Muiredaig (died 857) was a Dál Fiatach king of Ulaid, which is now Ulster, Ireland. He was the son of Muiredach mac Eochada (died 839), the previous king. He ruled from 839-857.
Life.
His father had been killed by his own brother Áed. However, Matudán killed his uncle and was able to acquire the throne.
Vikings were on Lough Neagh in 839 and wintered there in 840-841 in the opening years raiding the various parts of the north including the Ulaid territories. In 852 the Norse fought a fierce naval battle with newcomers, the Danes, in Carlingford Lough but were heavily defeated. Matudán may have given land support to the Norse forces in this battle.
In 851 Matudán met with the high king Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid (died 863) of the southern Uí Néill in Armagh. In a meeting presided over by the clerics of Armagh and Mide, Matudán formally acknowledged the authority of the high king. This led in 855 to an attack by Áed Findliath, King of Ailech, of the northern Ui Neill. However his foray failed and he left behind slain kin. Áed Findliath had as one of his wives the sister of Matudán- Gormlaith Rapach "the harsh".
The annals record a possible co-ruler (leth-rí -"half king") Cathmal mac Tommaltaig of the Leth Cathail branch of the Dál Fiatach (in Lecale, modern County Down) who is not recorded in the king lists. Cathmal was slain by the Norse in 853.
Matudán died in 857 and according to the "Fragmentary Annals" he took clerical orders prior to his death. His descendants (if any) did not hold the throne of Ulaid which descended through the line of his uncle Áed.

W. Otto Miessner

William Otto Miessner (May 26, 1880 - May 27, 1967) was an American composer and music educator.
Life and career.
Born in Huntingburg, Indiana, Miessner was the son of Charles Miessner and Mary Miessner (née Reutepohler). He graduated from Huntingburg High School in 1898. He earned a diploma from the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, where he studied music theory with A. J. Gantvoort, piano with Frederick Hoffman, and singing with Adolph Devin-Duvivier. He later pursued further studies in New York with Frederick Bristol (singing), A. J. Goodrich (harmony and counterpoint), and Edgar Stillman Kelley (composition). He also studied voice in Berlin, taking lessons in 1910 with Alexander Heinemann. He then taught music from 1900 until 1904 at a school in Boonville, Indiana, before going to Connersville to teach elementary and high school music; he stayed there from 1905 until 1909. Miessner has been quoted as saying that "The idle mind is the devil’s workshop. But this is my workshop and I’ll not tolerate an idle mind as long as there’s excitement in music."
One day in 1906, Miessner met three students in the street; they had been suspended from school earlier in the day due to misbehavior. The three were watching a minstrel show, keeping time with their hands while listening. Miessner made a deal with the three boys: he would get them reinstated in school if they, in exchange, would learn to play instruments in a school band which he was at the time planning to form. They agreed; Miessner, for his part, encouraged them to practice by promising them a public concert and uniforms in the school colors. The experiment was a success, and Connersville High School became possessed of the first public high school band in the United States. Miessner received a great deal of exposure for his work in starting the band, which was chosen to perform at a convention of the Northern and Southern Indiana Teacher’s Association in 1908. This performance received a notice in "School Music", at the time a national publication for music educators, and Miessner's name was made.
Miessner went on to serve in a number of teaching and administrative positions during the remainder of his career. He was the director of the music schools of Milwaukee State Teachers College from 1914 until 1922, and from 1911 until 1924 taught at summer sessions at Northwestern University. He founded the Miessner Institute of Music in Milwaukee in 1924. In 1936 he became head of the Department of Music Education at the University of Kansas, where he headed the graduate studies program and remained until 1945. In addition, he co-edited music textbooks for Silver Burdett for forty years and served ten years as president of the Miessner Piano Company in Milwaukee. He also received many honors for his work as an educator, including honorary doctorates from the Cincinnati Conservatory and Chicago Musical College. He was a life member of the Music Educators National Conference, whose president he was from 1923 until 1924; he was also a member of Phi Delta Kappa, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, and Pi Kappa Lambda. While in Boonville, he also served as a music director for a number of local organizations, including the Methodist church. In 1986 he was inducted into the Music Educators National Conference Hall of Fame.
Upon his retirement, Miessner returned to Connersville. Upon learning that no music teacher could be found for some of the local schools, he obtained an emergency permit that allowed him to return to teaching for three years, beginning in 1956. He was then told that he would have to take a beginners' course in teaching to retain his permit; feeling that his experience as a teacher should exempt him from such work, he declined. He died in Connersville in 1967.
Miessner is primarily remembered as an educator, but he wrote music as well. Most of his music was composed for choir, but he also wrote songs as well as some pieces for piano. He also wrote pedagogical works for beginning violinists and pianists, and compiled teaching materials about symphonic music and American songs.

Julian Antonisz

Julian Antonisz (November 8, 1941 – January 31, 1987), born Julian Józef Antoniszczak, was a Polish avant-garde filmmaker, artist, animator, screenwriter, composer, and inventor.
Best known as an inventor and promoter of his unique animation technique called non-camera. "Sun: A Non-Camera Film" 1977 ("Słońce - film bez kamery") was his first all non-camera movie, although the technique has been used also in Antonisz's earlier productions. The idea after the tehnique was to paint or scratch the images directly onto the movie tape instead of using a camcorder. Usually one second of movie uses 24 frames. For example, his debut film "Phobia" 1967, lasts 11 minutes. 660 seconds times 24 frames gives us 15,840 images that had to be painted.
Antonisz famous of his mechanical skills, has constructed numerous accessories supporting the creation of non-camera movies. Antoniszograf fazujący was a machine which scratched a set of frames, with a fluid transition between the two following images. Another invention was a prototype of chropograf (could be translated as scabrographe), which created an image with distinctive levels of roughness, allowing the blind to recognize shapes presented on the picture.
His most awarded work is "How a Sausage Dog Works" 1971 ("Jak działa jamniczek").

Nittany Lion Shrine

The Nittany Lion Shrine is a large lion sculpture made by Heinz Warneke located at the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University. The shrine is the second most photographed landmark in Pennsylvania, behind the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia.
History.
The Nittany Lion Shrine at Pennsylvania State University was dedicated on October 24, 1942 during Homecoming. Animalier Heinz Warneke and stonecutter Joseph Garatti created it from a 13-ton block of Indiana Limestone. The shrine was chosen from six models submitted by Warneke.
The shrine is a gift of the class of 1940 and rests in a natural setting of trees near Recreation Building.
In 2013 the shrine was renovated to improve the lighting, add a sidewalk, and add large decorative stones. The improvement was the gift by the Penn State's class of 2012. 
Incidents.
In 1966 Sue Paterno (wife of football coach Joe Paterno), and a friend secretly splashed water-soluble orange paint on the Nittany Lion statue the week of the Syracuse game. Later that week Syracuse fans covered the statue in oil-based paint, which was tougher to remove. Since then, students guard the Lion Shrine every homecoming.
In another football weekend incident in 1978, the Lion Shrine was vandalized when a blunt object was used to break off the statue's right ear. The original sculptor - Heinz Warneke - was alive at the time and, with some difficulty, was able to match the stone and repair the damaged ear. This incident led to the site being guarded during home football games.

A mobile tracking platform for recording data on missiles and satellites that are out of range of established land stations, "Range Tracker" was homeported at Port Hueneme, California, on the Pacific Missile Range from June 1961 to 1969. 
She was operated by the Military Sea Transportation Service with a civilian crew. 
Tracking astronauts.
USNS "Range Tracker's" inertial navigation system monitored astronaut Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit space flight during July 1963.

The field was inaugurated on October 7, 1911 with the college football team's 29-0 win over Mercer. Two months later on the field, Auburn High School played the program's first football game, against Sidney Lanier High School, on November 25, 1911.
Auburn High School continued to play football at the stadium until moving to their on-campus stadium Ross Field in 1921; they returned to Drake Field in 1935 after outgrowing that facility. Both the high school and the college football teams moved to adjacent Auburn Stadium, today Jordan-Hare Stadium, in 1939. The college baseball team continued playing at Drake Field until 1949, when they moved to Plainsman Park. The field remained until the construction of the Haley Center in the late 1960s.

The Antique Gift Shop

The Antique Gift Shop () is a manhwa created by Lee Eun. In the United States Yen Press (originally Ice Kunion) publishes the series. The series is still being released in the U.S.
The series is about Bun-nyuh Cho, a girl who once attended the famous S University with stellar grades who was tricked by her grandmother to run an antique shop instead. But the cursed antiques have their own way of selecting and affecting the lives of their new owners, or mysteriously finding a way back to their old masters.
Bun-nyuh is a modern girl who can't stand her new job as shop proprietor, speaks her mind, hates everything superstitious and doesn't believe in things that can't be explained by science. Originally slated to go to medical school, she makes a bet with her grandmother that if she is able to sell all the antiques in the shop, she will be free to live the life she chooses. If she does not, she must give up her modern lifestyle and follow in her grandmother's footsteps as a shaman in the family business.
In the United States the first volume was originally released in November 2005, while the second appeared in February 2006 and the third appeared in May 2006. Now published by Yen Press, volumes five and six were finally released in the U.S. August and December 2008.
Volume One.
Chapter 1: The Summer Guest
An introductory story about a twice returned antique ""jookbu-in"." The long-haired, tall and handsome Mr. Yang, the store's sole employee, makes his first appearance. He has a mysterious knowledge of all the antiques in the store and an uncanny talent for reading minds.
Chapter 2: The Fox Lantern
One day a girl who is incapable of loving others walks into the shop and asks for some candles but ends up buying a magic fox lantern, once used in the emperor's palace to quell anxieties. The spirit in the lantern brings her dreams of a young man who has lost his love. 
Chapter 3: The Secret Garden, part 1
The tale of a love triangle between three high school students, Eun-jae, Yang-ji and Dan-soo that almost ends badly but for the help of Mr. Yang and an antique diary that can only be read when moistened with tears.
Volume Two.
Chapter 3: The Secret Garden, part 2
The story of Dan-soo, cursed now by ""mongdalgui"" until the day he dies, and Jae-min, a recently deceased "mongdalgui". It's an unlucky day for Bun-nyuh when she, out of spite, takes off the talisman her grandmother gave her for protection.
Volume Three.
Chapter 4: The Secret Garden, finale
Mr. Yang comes to Bun-nyuh's rescue with the help of an antique back scratcher and places the talisman around her neck once more. Bun-nyuh learns that even if she doesn't believe in her grandmother's ways, her past is still a part of who she is.
Chapter 5: "Gahwi"
Bun-nyuh's past is surrounded by bad luck—it's no wonder she's suppressed most of the bad memories. Raised by her grandmother in a small, quiet village in rural Korea, young Bun-nyuh's first encounter with the cursed antiques results in tragedy. Mr. Yang's connection to Bun-nyuh's past, and the origins of the antique gift shop are revealed.
Volume Four.

List of characters.
Bun-nyuh Cho: The young proprietor of "The Antique Gift Shop" who would rather be in school. She was raised by her grandmother in the rural countryside of Korea but abandoned in Seoul at a young age on a rainy night. Her mother was also buried on a rainy day, therefore causing Bun-nyuh to have a phobia of rain. Bun-nyuh was raised in a Christian orphanage and watched over by a distant relative during her adolescence. Because of her tomboyish and rough attitude, she was much admired by the girls in school when she was younger.
Though she is able to see spirits and ghosts, she stubbornly refuses to admit belief in anything that can't be explained by science. Bun-nyuh also excels in fortune-telling, just like her mother and grandmother. She has a selective memory of the tragic events in her past and is constantly in denial of her true feelings. She hates feeling weak or helpless. Bun-nyuh is also very modern, cursing and swearing and giving the one-fingered salute wherever she goes. She loves designer labels and would rather go shopping than pay her employees. She maintained excellent grades while in school before taking a leave of absence from the prestigious S University. Despite her loathing for it, she is also an excellent salesperson.
Yang/Mr. Yang: The only employee of the "Antique Gift Shop", Mr. Yang is almost 7 feet tall and has long, silky hair flowing nearly to the floor. He has a very god-like quality about him. When he is not dressed in his shop uniform and apron, he dons archaic embroidered robes and very old-fashioned clothing. His delicate features are very beautiful and almost feminine.
Though not revealed in volumes 1 - 6, the reader has the sense that he has known Bun-nyuh's family for quite some time. He refers to her ancestral village as his "hometown." He also possesses the ability to "speak" to the antiques and to read minds. Though he dislikes humans for their inability to believe things they don't understand our cannot see, he is known by the antiques as "the one who serves humans." There is the sense that he has served one human in particular, Bun-nyuh, for centuries.
Mr. Yang actually knows more about Bun-nyuh and her family than he lets on, and more than even Bun-nyuh is aware of herself. Though their relationship is often characterized as "master-servant" in other instances the relationship between Bun-nyuh and Mr. Yang could be characterized as "student-teacher." In brief moments in the manhwa, their relationship can be characterized as "intimate," as when they go to the movies together, when he puts her to bed as she recovers from a hangover, when he saves her from being raped by the "mongdalgui" possessed Dan-soo, and when he tells the "hwatu" characters to cheer her up while he's gone because he knows it will rain. 
Grandmother: Bun-nyuh's only living blood relative in the world, her grandmother is a shaman of the Divine Spirit and can see ghosts/spirits, conduct purifications, exorcisms and predict/read fortunes. She is mysteriously under a curse and is constantly hounded by a 'spirit guide' who takes the form of a woman in white with long hair. Her spirit guide claims that Bun-nyuh's grandmother 'owes her' but is willing take over Bun-nyuh to satisfy this debt. The nature of grandmother's curse stems from both her and her spirit guide having the same fiancé in the past who collected the cursed antiques to begin with, Mr. Sailor Park. Bun-nyuh's grandmother abandoned her in Seoul to let her granddaughter live a 'normal' life for as long as possible before the family curse caught up with Bun-nyuh.
Ie-rang Ha/Nae-soong Ha: Bun-nyuh's best friend in high school who subsequently became a popular Korean actress. Ie-rang was a beautiful but shy girl who was bullied. Like Bun-nyuh, Ie-rang was primarily an orphan. Bun-nyuh holds a grudge against Ie-rang for stealing her first love. Ie-rang only stole Bun-nyuh's first love because she was in love with Bun-nyuh. She later confesses that Bun-nyuh was her first love in her autobiographical movie, "Raise the Flag." Bun-nyuh slept through most of the movie. Ie-rang was supposed to go the US for her career, but she postponed that and additional plastic surgery to pop in on Bun-nyuh from time to time after she discovered Bun-nyuh's Antique Gift Shop.
In-gyu: A young man from a wealthy family who has amnesia after a car accident. He loses his lover in the accident and his family will not let him remember her because they disapproved of their union. He is beckoned to wander and find the red lantern he sees in his dreams. 
Yoon-ju: In-gyu's deceased lover. She was known to have a psychological disorder. 
Soo-young: The anti-social young writer who takes up renting In-gyu and Yoon-ju's old apartment. She purchases the Fox Lantern from the shop because its spirit called to her. The lantern brings her dreams of In-gyu and she finds herself falling in love with him and wishing she were Yoon-ju. She is unaware of their plight until she finally meets In-gyu in person. 
Eun-jae Jung: A young girl who purchases the Hollow Diary from the shop. She intents to share it with her best friend Yang-ji, whom she is secretly in love with. Yang-ji, however, is in love with Dan-soo, a popular boy from school. Eun-jae soon discovers that Dan-soo is a playboy who is dating and mistreating her sister. Yang-ji misunderstands and believes Eun-jae is in love with Dan-soo, thus causing a rift in their relationship.
Dan-soo: One of the most good looking and popular boys in school, his classmates are unaware that he made a pact with cursed ghosts called "mongdalgui" in order to get that way. Over time, he begins to lose control to the mongdalgui and lust after more women and even tries to force himself on Yang-ji and Bun-nyuh. Yang stops him and tells him he must become a monk or he will die young. 
Yang-ji: Eun-jae's clueless best friend from school who doesn't realize the value of their friendship until she almost loses it.
Ji-yong: Bun-nyuh's childhood friend who carried an umbrella everywhere he went and died under mysterious circumstances. His spirit still lingers at Bun-nyuh's ancestral home.
Yun-ook: A headstrong mob daughter who is in love with her childhood friend Tae-joo, but can't have him because of a prophecy that she will kill her first husband.
Tae-joo: The unlucky object of Yun-ook's desires since childhood. He runs the mob group organized by her father after the untimely death of the mob boss. He is unable to marry because he is in love with Yun-ook.
Green Ruperts: Grim reapers who take the dead to Hell. They have pale faces and dress all in black as they carry a list in the form of a scroll with the names of the dead when they work. Their mottos are 'no gambling' and 'precision.' Despite this they have a love for gambling and playing "hwatu" cards, and on some occasions are not precise in who they claim for dead. The leader of the Green Ruperts has an intimate history with Bun-nyuh's family as he was the one who took her mother on the day she died when he was originally supposed to take Bun-nyuh.
Bun-hong: Bun-nyuh's insane mother. Faulted for being 'weak minded' as a shaman, she was possessed and then went insane, was cursed to act like a child for the remainder of her days. She ran away from home and worked in a beauty salon for a time, conceived Bun-nyuh with the son of a wealthy family, and then came back. Every February 12, on the anniversary of her death, Bun-nyuh's grandmother and Mr. Yang will greet Bun-hong's spirit, now in her right mind in death. Bun-hong waits every year for her daughter to come pay her respects, but every year waits in vain.

'Katok Tsewang Norbu' (Wylie: "kaḥ thog tshe dbang nor bu") (1698–1755) was a Nyingmapa (follower of the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism) who championed the view of 'extrinsic emptiness' or Zhentong (Wylie: "gzhen-stong") which he propagated amongst his tradition. His seat was the Katok Monastery of Tibet.
Contextualising Zhentong.
After the suppression of the Jonang school and its texts and the texts of Sakya Chokden by the 5th Dalai Lama in the 17th century, various Shentong views were propagated mainly by Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas. In particular, the 8th Tai Situ Rinpoche (Situ Paṇchen Chökyi Jungné (si tu paṇ chen chos kyi 'byung gnas) (1700–1774)) and Katok Tsewang Norbu (kaḥ thog tshe dbang nor bu) (1698–1755), close colleagues and Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas respectively, were very instrumental in reviving Shentong among their sects. He influenced his student Situ Panchen in the study, who accordingly spread his beliefs; according to 2003's "The Budda from Dolpo", "n the end it would be Situ more than anyone who would create the environment for the widespread acceptance of the Zhentong theories in the next century. This revival was continued by Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye, a 19th-century Rime ('non-partisan') scholar and forceful partisan of Shentong, and were also advanced recently by the eminent Kagyu Lamas Kalu Rinpoche and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche.

Polypterus ornatipinnis

The ornate bichir ("Polypterus ornatipinnis") is a bony fish found in Lake Tanganyika and the Congo River basin in Central and East Africa.
Description.
"P. ornatipinnis" has black and yellow patterning on its body, head, and fins, with 9 to 11 dorsal spines. It is the largest of the "Polypterus" species, with a protruding upper jaw, reaching in length. This fish can range in colour from dark brown to brownish grey, and is very common in the aquarium trade, like many other bichirs. This fish has a primitive pair of lungs, enabling it to survive out of water for a short time. It has eyes on the sides on its head and two pectoral fins, and is one of the more attractive of the bichirs.

Utah State Route 93

State Route 93 (SR-93) is a state highway in the US state of Utah providing a connection from I-15 to US-89. The highway is completely in the city limits of Woods Cross, spanning . The entire route is routed along 2600 South. It was formed in 1965 coinciding with the construction of I-15 through the area. At the time of formation, the highway extended east to SR-106. However, in 1977 SR-106 became resigned as US-89.
Route description.
The highway initially begins at a three-way intersection at 800 West and 2600 South in Woods Cross. From that intersection, SR-93 heads southeast on 2600 South briefly before intersecting at a diamond interchange at I-15 at exit 315. The road intersects with a local road and veers northeasterly briefly before straightening out to the east and terminating at US-89. The entire highway is located in a commercial environment, with restaurants, supermarkets, car dealerships, and gas stations a portion of the businesses located on the road.
The interchange nearing the highway's western terminus provides the first exit in Davis County for northbound motorists on I-15 (southbound motorists are given an exit at Center Street southwest of 2600 South).
History.
State Route 93 was established in 1961 to provide a state-maintained connection from the under-construction I-15 to the town of Woods Cross and southern Bountiful. At that time, 2600 South was named 6500 South. However, in between 1961 and 1965, the road was renamed to its present designation. The route initially went east to SR-106. In 1969, a half-mile portion was transferred from SR-131 to SR-93, extending SR-93 south. In 1977, SR-106 was rerouted and US-89 replaced SR-106. In 1985, the western terminus was moved back to I-15.

Katok Monastery

Katok Monastery (Wylie: "kaḥ thog") is one of the six principal Nyingma monasteries, one of the main lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. It is located in Derge, Sichuan.
History.
Katok Monastery was founded in 1159 by a younger brother of Phagmodrupa, Katok Dampa Deshek, at Derge, the historic seat of the Eastern Tibetan Kingdom of Derge.
Katok Monastery's third abbot, Jampa Bum (1179-1252), whose 26-year tenure as abbot ended in 1252, "is said to have ordained thousands of monks from across Tibet, and especially from Kham region of Minyak (mi nyag), Jang ('byang), and Gyarong (rgyal mo rong)."
The original gompa fell into disrepair and was rebuilt on the same site in 1656 through the impetus of Tertön Düddul Dorje (1615–72) and the terton Rigdzin Longsal Nyingpo (1625-1682/92 or 1685–1752).
Katok Monastery held a reputation of fine scholarship. It is held that prior to the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese in 1951, that Katok Monastery housed about 800 monks.
Katok was long renowned as a center specializing in "kama" (as opposed to "terma"), and as a center of monasticism, although both of these features were disrupted under Longsel Nyingpo (1625–1692).
According to "The Tibetan Buddhist Resource Centre", disciples of Kenpo Munsel and Kenpo Jamyang at Katok Monastery in 1999 compiled a Katok edition of the "Kama" (Wylie: bka' ma shin tu rgyas pa (kaH thog)) in 120 volumes: "... twice the size of the Dudjom edition, it contains many rare Nyingma treatises on Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga that heretofore had never been seen outside of Tibet."
According to Alexander Berzin,
Katog has 112 branch monasteries, not only in Tibet, but also in Mongolia, Inner China, Yunnan, and Sikkim. For instance, Katog Rigdzin-tsewang-norbu (Ka:-thog Rigs-‘dzin Tshe-dbang nor-bu) (1698-1755) founded a large branch in Sikkim, and when the Eighth Tai Situ Rinpoche, Situ Panchen Chokyi-jungney (Si-tu Pan-chen Chos-kyi ‘byung-gnas) (1700-1744), visited China, he stayed at the Katog branch-monastery at the Five-Peaked Mountain of Manjushri (Ri-bo rtse-lnga, Chin: Wutai Shan), to the southwest of Beijing.
Anuyoga.
Kathog Monastery became a bastion of the Anuyoga tradition when it became neglected by other Nyingmapa institutions. The "Compendium of the Intentions Sūtra" (Wylie: "dgongs pa ’dus pa’i mdo") the root text of the Anuyoga tradition was instrumental in the early Kathog educational system. Nubchen Sangye Yeshe wrote a lengthy commentary on the "Compendium of the Intentions Sūtra" rendered in English as "Armor Against Darkness" (Wylie: "mun pa’i go cha").

Ross Field was an American football and baseball field located in Auburn, Alabama, United States from 1921 until 1998. It was the home field of the Auburn High School Tigers football team from 1921 until 1935. Ross Field was named for Bennett Battle Ross, Jr., an Auburn High School alumnus who was Dean of Chemistry and acting president of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (today Auburn University) who had worked to bring county flagship status to Auburn High in 1914. Ross Field was the first on-campus stadium for Auburn High School; previous football teams had shared Drake Field with the Auburn University football team. From 1929 onward, the field was sometimes known as Mitchell Field.
By the mid-1930s, Ross Field had grown too small to accommodate football crowds, and Auburn High games were moved back to Drake Field. When the former high school campus was transferred to the city of Auburn as a community center in the 1950s, the field was used as a community football and baseball field, and the football field was reconstructed as a softball field in 1964. The Jan Dempsey Community Arts Center was built on the site of Ross Field in 1998.

Berenguer de Palou II

Berenguer de Palou II (died 1241) was bishop of Barcelona from 1212 to 1241. He was a major supporter of James I of Aragon. 
He began his career as a canon priest in Barcelona Cathedral during the episcopate of his uncle Berenguer de Palou I. Shortly after being elected bishop in 1212, he marched with Peter II of Aragon on the latter’s crusade against the Almohads in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Later Palou served as royal councilor and chancellor of the Crown of Catalonia-Aragon. 
In 1219, he participated in the Fifth Crusade against Damietta in Egypt, contributing to the effort 50 knights and peons and unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the Cathar Crusade. 
He founded various establishments for the destitute, offering the Castle of Aviñón del Penedés and some of his own properties for this effort. He supported the founding of the Mercedarian Order in 1218. Bishop Berenguer de Palou gave Peter Nolasco and his companions the white habit that they would wear as characteristic of the Order; he gave them the Rule of Saint Augustine as a norm for their life in common and he gave his authorization for the sign of his cathedral, the Holy Cross, to be on the habit of the Order. After that, Peter Nolasco and the first Mercedarians made their religious profession before the bishop.
In 1219, Bishop Berenguer also supported the introduction into Barcelona of the Dominican and Franciscan Orders. 
In 1225, he accompanied James I on the unsuccessful attack on Peñíscola, Valencia. 
Together they planned the invasion of Majorca, to which he contributed 99 knights and 1,000 foot soldiers. As a reward, he received 875 knighthood lands and 8 windmills, which had originally been the possession of the barony of Andratx. During the military operations against the Muslims of Mallorca, he was wounded, his foot being mutilated during the last campaign against the Muslims of this island. 
In 1233, he was elected Archbishop of Tarragona, but Pope Gregory IX did not approve the election, and Palou did not occupy this see. 
In 1237, he helped found the Monastery of Santa Clara in Barcelona. 
In 1238, he participated in the conquest of the taifas of Valencia and Dénia. He received various estates as a result and the Seignory of Almonesir. 
He died in 1241, and his sepulcher can be found in the cathedral of Barcelona.

<doc id="18897988" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18897988" title="Degema language">
Degema language

Dẹgẹma is a Nigerian Delta Edoid language spoken in two separate communities on Degema Island by about 22,000 people, according to 1991 census figures (including projection figures for the two Dẹgẹma-speaking communities). The two communities are Usokun-Degema and Degema Town (Atala) in the Degema Local Government Area in Rivers State. Each community speaks a mutually-intelligible variety of Dẹgẹma, known by the names of the communities speaking them: the Usokun variety (spoken in Usokun-Degema) and the Degema Town (Atala) variety (spoken in Degema Town). Both varieties are similar in their phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic properties.
No standard variety has so far emerged between the two varieties of Dẹgẹma. However, there appear to be more scholarly and descriptive linguistic publications on the Usokun variety than on the Degema Town (Atala) variety.
The Dẹgẹma language is not also called "Atala" or "Udekaama", as stated in some publications. Atala is the alternative name for one of the Degema-speaking communities (Degema Town), and Udekaama is the name of a clan (which comprises Usokun-Degema and Degema Town). Similarly, "Kala Degema" is not an alternative name for the Usokun-Degema variety of Dẹgẹma as contained in the entry for Degema in the Ethnologue.
Phonology.
Dẹgẹma is the only Edoid language to match the vowel inventory reconstructed for Proto-Edoid. There are ten vowels, in two harmonic sets: and .
Degema history.
Oral tradition asserts that the Degema people (originally part of the Engenni people) migrated from Benin (in what is now the Edo State of Nigeria) to Ewu in present-day Engenni, in the Ahoada Local Government Area of Rivers State. According to Mark Roman (a native of Engenni and a staff member at the University of Port Harcourt, the people of present-day Degema settled at Ewu (near Akinima) when they left Benin with other groups who settled at Okilogua in Engenni (not in Akinima, as claimed). Roman asserts that Ewu is also in Okilogua. At Ewu, there was a split which took some of the inhabitants to Enuedua (Joinkrama) (forming the Enuedua group), some to Ediro (forming the Ediro group) and some to Ogua, forming the Ogua group. These groups make up the Engenni community. Roman also asserts that the Degema people belonged to the Ogua group.
The split at Ewu was in due to a disagreement over fish belonging to all the people living there. Some of those who contributed their own water to the cooking of fish did not get their share of the water after the cooking was done, not considering that water evaporates when heated. Those aggrieved decided to leave Ewu, and the name "Udekaama" became associated with the aggrieved group.
The Udekaama group went to the uninhabited Degema Island around the 15th century CE and settled at Ipokuma ("headland" or "cape" in Dẹgẹma), now known as Doctor’s Farm. The headland is the part of Degema Island adjacent to an uninhabited island on which Abonnema (a Kalabari-speaking community in the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State is situated. Udekaama is an umbrella term for two groups: Usokun-Degema and Degema Town (Atala) (headed by Ugu and Ekeze, respectively, who led the two groups from Ewu to Ipokuma. Ekomburu (Obonoma) is one of the groups comprising the Udekaama clan.
The settlement at Ipokuma was before the arrival of the Abonnema (about 1882) and the Kalabari tribe:
At Ipokuma Ugu and Ekeze led Usokun-Degema and Degema Town, respectively, north to their present sites for fishing, hunting and farming.
Neither of these two communities considers itself (or its leader) subordinate to the other; the two groups consider themselves independent.
The name "Degema" is a bastardized form of "Udekaama" (the name by which colonists referred to the Udekaama people), which may have resulted from the Kalabari mispronunciation of "Udekaama" as "Dekema" (which, in turn, became "Degema" on contemporary documents. "Udekaama" may also be an unwelcome reminder of the rift between their forefathers at Ewu. "Udekaama" is still found in official documents, mainly due to the assertion of ethnic identity by the Degema people (who are surrounded by Kalabari-speaking communities). The people of Degema are linguistically and culturally distinct from their Kalabari neighbours (The Kalabari people speak Kalabari, an Eastern Ijo language spoken in the Akuku Toru and Asari-Toru Local Government Areas of Rivers State. Kalabari is also spoken in some parts of the Degema Local Government Area.
Degema refers not only to the language spoken by the inhabitants of Usokun-Degema and Degema Town, it also refers to the people themselves, the land on which they live and their government (the administrative headquarters of the Degema Local Government Area).

Combat Arms

Combat Arms is a collective name in a system of administrative military reference to those troops within national armed forces which participate in direct tactical land combat. In general they include the Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery units.
In some countries, notably the British Army, the artillery units are categorised as Combat Support. Some armies such as the United States Army, classify combat engineers as a combat arm also, while armoured troops constitute a combat arm in name although many have histories derived from cavalry units. This is also true for the combat aviation units in many armed forces throughout the world. 
Artillery is included as a combat arm primarily based on the history of employing cannons in close combat, and later in the anti-tank role until the advent of anti-tank guided missiles. The inclusion of special forces in some armed forces as a separate combat arm is often doctrinal because the troops of special forces units are essentially specialized infantry, often with historical links to ordinary light infantry units. 
In Commonwealth Countries the combat arms in the Army are:
In the United States Army the following branches are considered Combat Arms:
- Note that Aviation and Engineer branches have many different roles, as such these branches can be Combat Arms, Combat Support or Combat Service Support depending on function.
United States Marine Corps doctrine designates only Infantry forces as Combat Arms, with all other Ground Combat Element forces (Artillery, Assault Amphibian, Combat Engineer, Light Armored Reconnaissance, Reconnaissance, and Tank) considered Combat Support. (Air Defense, as a part of Marine Aviation, is contained within the Aviation Combat Element.)

List of Maryland hurricanes (1950–1979)

Between 1950 and 1979, approximately 29 recorded tropical cyclones have significantly affected the U.S. state of Maryland. The Delmarva Peninsula is often affected by cyclones that brush the East Coast, while central and western Maryland commonly receive rainfall from the remnants of storms that make landfall elsewhere and track northward. Hurricanes are the most intense classification of tropical cyclones; tropical storms and tropical depressions are generally weaker.
Hurricane Agnes of the 1972 season was the deadliest storm, killing 19 people as a result of heavy flooding. Agnes was also the costliest storm, leaving about $80 million in damage. Hurricane Hazel caused sustained hurricane-force winds (winds of 75 mph (121 km/h) or greater) in the state, the only storm during the time period to do so. No storms made landfall in Maryland at hurricane intensity. Between 1950 and 1979, tropical cyclones have collectively killed approximately 40 people and inflicted over $93 million in damage.

Anything for Love

Anything for Love is a 1993 direct-to-video teen comedy film, starring Corey Haim and Nicole Eggert. It was aired on television in the United States as Just One of the Girls, and as "He's My Girl II" in Germany and Hungary.
Plot.
Summer is over and 16-year-old Chris (Corey Haim), who is constantly bullied, is enrolling in a new high school. Tired of being beaten up, he asks his father to teach him how to fight. The school bullies can still beat him up, however, so he decides that he will disguise himself every day as a girl to walk past them into school. Initially, he only plans on dressing up as a girl to get into school, but he soon grows used to the role of being a female. For instance, he likes being able to talk trash to his chief tormentor, Kurt (Cameron Bancroft), who falls in love with him, and also befriending a girl named Marie (Nicole Eggert), a cheerleader and also Kurt's sister, whom Chris has a crush on.
Enthusiastic at the prospect of going to cheerleader camp and sharing a room with Marie, Chris signs up to become a cheerleader. In a short period of time, Chris wins both Marie and Kurt's trust. After Kurt admits to Chris that he is only behaving the way he does because of peer pressure, Chris convinces him to apologize to his friend Dan, who has also been bullied by Kurt and his gang. 
Problems begin when Kurt starts to make advances towards Chris and he starts almost getting caught. His PE teacher notices he is looking at the girls in the locker room, and thinking Chris is a lesbian, takes him to her office for a conversation. Chris, thinking she is talking to him about actually being a boy, admits his disguise. The PE teacher threatens to tell the principal the truth, but Chris convinces her not to do so by lying that he is a transvestite and enjoys dressing up in women's clothing. Later that evening, Marie visits Chris at home. His parents, unaware that Chris is going to school as a girl, mistake her for his girlfriend.
Dealing with Marie and his parents at the same time causes Chris some trouble, but he keeps up his subterfuge. However, when Kurt drops by to bring Chris flowers, his father Louis starts to think he is gay. By lying about Kurt's sexuality, Chris is able to convince his father that he is straight and nothing is wrong. The next day Chris is to leave for cheerleader camp. When Louis finds out, he finally realizes Chris has been dressing up as a girl. Meanwhile, Chris attempts to kiss Marie while practicing their cheerleadering choreography, but she pushes him away and runs off.
Encouraged by his PE teacher to tell the truth, Chris reveals himself to be a boy during a cheerleader performance. Kurt threatens to beat him up, but when Chris defends him for not being gay, they finally make peace. Marie feels betrayed, thinking that Chris only tried to get her in bed, but she eventually decides to forgive him.

Striped killifish

The striped killifish ("Fundulus majalis"), also called the striped mummichog, is a North American species of saltwater killifish (occasionally also found in brackish water), dwelling in shallow coastal waters close to shore, and is found from New Hampshire to Florida.
It exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the males having vertical black stripes and the mature females having horizontal black stripes along the sides of their silver-colored bodies. Juvenile females have vertical stripes, however, and one or two vertical stripes remain at the end of the tail even on adult females. The striped killifish reaches lengths of 6 (or occasionally 7) inches.
Tidepool survival techniques.
In Feb 1916, Popular Science Monthly had a news article on research being done by Professor S. O. Mast of the zoological department of Johns Hopkins. The professor was studying the "Fundulus majolisis" and noted their ability to survive the draining of ocean tide pools. These fish would swim and out of the tide pools on regular intervals, somehow knowing when to swim out before the tidewaters drained from the pools. If for some reason the outlet of the pool were to close off as the tide went out, the fish would quickly swim around the tide pool randomly looking for an alternate escape route.
If the fish cannot find an exit, they actually leave the water and flop over land to reach the ocean. Professor Mast saw scores and scores of these fish leave large tide pools and travel across sand bars up to 12 feet wide and six inches tall. The fish nearly always leave the pool on the side towards the ocean, and are able to travel straight towards the ocean rather than flopping around randomly. At the time it was not known how the fish are able to find the ocean so readily.
After about three minutes of becoming trapped in a rapidly disappearing tide pool, a dense aggregation of fish form on the side of the pool towards the ocean, and swim up and down the side of the pool. Then in groups of about twelve the fish leave the pool and head across land towards the sea.

LaMB

LaMB is an animated film produced by Animax. The film has also been developed into four different episodes for Mobile and PSP users.
The original script for the film was written by Carmelo S. J. Juinio, one of the finalists of the 2007 Animax Awards Pan-Asia Animation competition. In 2009, the competition was broadcast in high definition across several countries. The film was illustrated by Yasufumi Soejima and directed by Ryosuke Tei. It was the first Animax original production that provided two different songs for the opening and ending themes of the movie, featuring the music of Simple Plan and The Click Five. 
The film tells the story of a futuristic inhabited planet that has seemingly perfected a system of justice and imprisonment, called "Lamination". Individuals convicted of serious crimes are encased in laminated suits, which results in virtual slavery. The criminals are referred to as "LaMBs". The protagonists struggle with the political and ethical system of laminated imprisonment, leading to the eventual development of a romantic relationship between a free citizen and a LaMB.
Plot summary.
"LaMB" takes place in the distant future on a desert planet called Cerra. The story features a prison system, in which prisoners are sealed in personal containment systems known as "laminated suits" and used for labor. Prisoners go through a "Lamination" process, where they are fitted with cybernetic, laminated skin-tight suits. In these suits, they can move around and completed work assignments that cannot be done by machine or robots. Law-abiding citizens are protected, while the criminals become members of society in a futuristic prison system. This process ensures that convicted criminals remain productive members in a system of virtual slavery. The story encompasses the dichotomy between the theory and practice of a futuristic society's justice system.
The lamination process and system of virtual slavery has made both jails and the death penalty obsolete in a world where human ingenuity, creativity, and labor continue to be precious commodities that cannot be replaced by robots or any form of artificial intelligence. The system also sparks off philosophical debates among citizens presenting pros and cons of the ethical feasibility of "Lamination".
The story follows protagonists Sara Integra and Jack Griswold's struggle against Cerra's system of imprisonment. Major Sara Integra is a former weapons specialist in bio-weapons division. While she was on a military assignment, innocent lives were lost during an experiment gone wrong. She was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 200 years encased in a laminated suit. Sara forever became known as Eve, or Eve1135.
When she became a LaMB, Eve was assigned a Shepherd. Shepherds control the actions and movement of the LaMBs. Included among the laws of society are that LaMBs must only act upon instructions of their Shepherds. While LaMBs can hear others, they cannot speak, nor can they touch another human being unless ordered by their Shepherd. Dr. Jack Griswold was assigned to be Eve's Shepherd. 
Griswold is a scientist from another planet, specializing in advanced botanical engineering. He has been assigned the task to restore vegetation to the dry, desert planet. Among Griswold's superiors is Keiko Suzuki, Chief Scientific Advisor specializing in biophysics, and Sara Integra's niece. She has been deeply affected by the death of her parents, and her aunt's imprisonment, and lamination and has made revenge her ultimate goal in life. 
Griswold tends to display workaholic traits, presumably in order to forget the recent loss of his wife. His curiosity and soul-searching thirst to understand the complexities of the universe drives his research. He tends to spend more time in the lab than anywhere else and his intense focus on his research makes him appear awkward when in comes to social interaction. Griswold inadvertently gets pulled into the politics and ethics behind the system of "Lamination", as well as a romance with Eve.
Keiko's anti-LaMB organization and conspiracy is discovered, and she is put into a lamb suit. Due to recent developments in technology her suit is part plant possibly. She goes on a rampage and tries to destroy Eve1135, but she is immobilized by touching Griswold while she attacked him. She loses her balance and falls off the building. Eve1135 is eventually released from prison (possibly hundreds of years later) and she is just Sara Integra and she kisses Griswold after they put flowers on his wife's grave.
Production development.
LaMB is based on a screenplay originally entitled "Laminated Woman: To the Sand Planet Cerra", written by Carmelo S. J. Juinio. Its release is considered by Animax, to be an example of the industry potential of user-generated content. The film has been dubbed into several languages for several different regions: English for the Southeast Asian region, Mandarin for China, Cantonese for Hong Kong, and Japanese for Animax Japan. The film has been shown on Animax channels throughout the world. 
The film is Animax's first original production presented in high definition (HD), and encompasses a series of multi-platform, multidisciplinary, and multimedia activities that revolve around the launch of the movie. The goal of the film producers included the desire to redefine the entertainment experience for consumers from premiere to post-premiere of the film. 
Voice actors.
American Taiwan-based singer and actor Vanness Wu provided the voice for protagonist Dr. Jack Griswold. LaMB represents Wu's first venture into voice acting for animation, providing dubs in both English and Mandarin. His only previous voice acting experience was in the Mandarin version of Disney/Pixar's animated feature, "Cars".
Petrina Kow provides the voice of protagonist Sara Integra, known as Eve. Kow, based in Singapore, is a nationally-known Animation Voice Director and radio host. She has directed and voiced pre-school shows, which include "Taoshu: The Warrior Boy", "Shapes" and "Olive and The Rhyme Rescue Crew." She was a presenter on the Class 95FM morning radio show with Mark Van Cuylenberg from 2000-2002, and co-hosted the Radio 91.3 morning show with Joe Augustin from 2006-2007. 
The voice of Keiko Suzuki was provided by award-winning Hong Kong actress Josie Ho. Dubs were made in English and Cantonese. In 2004, she was honored with the Hong Kong Award as Best Supporting Actress for her work on the film, "Naked Ambition". Tanaka Chie, a Japanese-born, Taiwan-based actress provided Keiko with her voice in the Mandarin dub.
Soundtrack.
Canadian band Simple Plan's "I Can Wait Forever" is used as the title track for LaMB. The song "Summertime", by American band The Click Five is also featured in the film. Animax Asia and Peach Blossom Media produced music videos for both songs that premiered on Animax across Asia and online on December 2008.
Fashion design.
Vivienne Tam, a New York based Fashion designer, designed the dresses used by LaMB characters. The designs have been made into real dresses for LaMB based events held across Asia.
Online game.
Sony Pictures Television has developed a LaMB online game, broken into four, unique chapters. There is also a meta game that offers each user the opportunity to select a side in the battle. User options include pro– or anti–lamination. Individual scores earned are additionally compiled and contributed to each side for an overall competition of "LaMBs vs. Shepherds".

<doc id="18898168" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18898168" title="Brown v. United States">
Brown v. United States

Brown v. United States, , was an appeal from the Court of Claims regarding one James Brown, the intestate of the appellant, who was a boatswain in the United States Navy. The petition in this case was filed against the United States by the administratrix of his estate in the Court of Claims to recover a balance of pay which she alleged was due to Brown at his death.
The Court of Claims found the following facts:
The decedent Brown, was appointed a boatswain in the Navy of the United States, January 4, 1862. On October 22, 1872, the Naval Retiring Board, before which he had been ordered by the Secretary of the Navy under the provisions of § 23 of the Act of August 3, 1861, 12 Stat. 291, reported that he was incapacitated from performing the duties of his office, and that there was no evidence that such incapacity was the result of any incident of the service. He was accordingly, upon the day last mentioned, by order of the President, retired on furlough pay. From October 22, 1872, to June 30, 1875, Brown received pay at the rate of $900 per annum, and from July 1, 1875, to June 6, 1879, at the rate of $500 per annum. On the day last named, he died.
The court also found that the Acts of August 3, 1861, 12 Stat. 290, and of December 21, 1861, 12 Stat. 329, were soon after their enactment construed by the President and Navy Department to include warrant officers, and under that construction it had been the uniform practice of the President to place warrant officers on the retired list, and large numbers of these officers had been so retired. No protest or objection was made by Brown during his lifetime, either to his retirement or rate of pay. The accounting officers of the Treasury had uniformly held that longevity pay to retired officers was not authorized by § 1593 of the Revised Statutes.
From these findings of fact the Court of Claims deduced, as a conclusion of law, that Brown was legally placed on the retired list, and had received the full amount of pay allowed him by law, and was not entitled to recover, and entered judgment dismissing the petition. The appeal of the petitioner brings that judgment under review.
The appellant asserted that the law applied only to commissioned officers, and not to warrant officers, to which latter class Brown belonged.
The question, however, was not a new one, and the findings showed that soon after the enactment of the act, the President and the Navy Department construed the section to include warrant as well as commissioned officers, and that they have since that time uniformly adhered to that construction, and that under its provisions, large numbers of warrant officers have been retired. This contemporaneous and uniform interpretation is entitled to weight in the construction of the law, and in a case of doubt ought to turn the scale.
The appellant next contended that the retirement of Brown was illegal because, at the time of his retirement, no officer could be placed on the retired list for disability not originating in the line of duty.
The theory behind this contention is this: the statute required that all officers retired for disability or incompetency not resulting from long and faithful service or wounds or injuries received in the line of duty or from sickness or exposure therein should be retired on furlough pay, and, as §§ 3, 5, and 19 of the Naval Appropriation Act of July 15, 1870, 16 Stat. 321, abolished the furlough pay list, the President was only authorized to retire Brown wholly from the service with one year's pay. The court thought it was clear that the sections of the statute referred to were not intended to abolish the furlough pay list. So far as they refer to retired officers, they apply to the retired list, and not the retired list on furlough pay. For thirty years, the legislation of Congress has divided retired naval officers into two classes. By § 2 of the Act of February 28, 1855, 10 Stat. 616, the officers on the retired, or, as it was then designated, reserved list were divided into those entitled to receive leave of absence pay and those entitled to receive furlough pay.
The distinction between the two classes of retired officers has been preserved down to the present time. By § 23 of the Act of August 3, 1861, 12 Stat. 290, 291, under which Brown retired, provided that officers incapacitated for active service from long service, wounds, etc., should be placed on the list of retired officers, but those incapacitated from other causes should be retired upon furlough pay. So, by § 2 of the Act approved July 28, 1866, 14 Stat. 345, it was provided that the rate of pay of officers of the navy on the retired list and not on duty nor retired on furlough pay, should be one-half the pay to which such officers would be entitled if on duty at sea.
This legislation has been reproduced in the Revised Statutes, where the distinction between officers on the retired list and officers on the retired list on furlough pay is preserved. Thus, §§ 1588 and 1592 prescribe one rate of pay for retired officers, and § 1593 a different rate for officers on the retired list on furlough pay, and § 1594 authorizes the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to transfer any officer of the navy on the retired list from the furlough to the retired pay list. It is plain, therefore, that section 5 of the Act of July 15, 1870, relied on by appellant and which is the only one which refers to the pay of retired officers, applies in both its terms and meaning only to the pay of officers on the retired list, and not to the compensation of officers retired on furlough pay, to which class Brown belonged, and did not abolish the furlough pay list. The order of the President retiring Brown on furlough pay was therefore made strictly in accordance with the provisions of the statute then and still in force.
It was next objected that the order of the President retiring Brown was illegal and void because the retiring board, having reported him incapacitated, did not find and report what was the cause of his incapacity, but only that there was no evidence that it was the result of any incident of the service. But as it is incumbent on the officer whose case comes before a retiring board to show, in order to secure a report which will entitle him to be placed on the retired list rather than on the retired list on furlough pay, that his incapacity was the result of some incident of the service, the report of the board that there was no evidence to support such a finding is to all intents and purposes a report that the incapacity was not the result of an incident of the service, and justifies an order retiring the officer on furlough pay.
The court's opinion was that the order of the President retiring Brown was authorized by law, and was regular and valid.
Appellant next insists that, conceding the retirement of Brown to be valid, he did not receive, after July 1, 1875, the pay to which he was entitled.
However, in the court's opinion, Brown was paid in his lifetime all that he was entitled to receive under the laws then in force. The judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing his petition was therefore right, and was affirmed.

Boutique manufacturing

Boutique manufacturing is a method used for the custom production of certain products in limited quantities by hand or with a restricted level of automation. Products produced this way often include ceramics, furniture, amplifiers, yachts, boats, leather goods or watches and jewellery among others. In industrial countries, boutique manufacturing is being selected generally for high class goods in upper price levels and only for single products or small batches.
Benefits and disadvantages.
The key advantages of boutique manufacturing in comparison to traditional factory manufacturing with batch fabrication, large or mass production are as follows:
Consequently, boutique manufacturing closes the gap between piece production and small batch/low volume production. The workflow organization of a boutique manufacturing entity can be a mixture of both – elements of jobbing or batch production, however involving higher standardization than the first one. Often boutique manufacturing workshop and factories are organized with single workplaces or production cells carrying out a number of subsequent production steps until completion of certain components or even the whole product. Flexibility and variety of products being able to produce in the entity therefore are much higher than with the more standardized method batch production. 
However, with this method, manufacturing of larger quantities of unified products is not possible at reasonable costs. Serial fabrication or large production of goods then would be suitable alternative production methods involving higher grades of automation and standardization.

Douglas Ollivant is a Senior National Security Studies Fellow at the New America Foundation as well as a Principal of the O2 Group and an operating advisor to Monument Capital Group. Most recently, Doug was a senior counterinsurgency advisor to Regional Command-East, as part of the International Security Assistance Force COIN Advisory and Assistance Team. A former Director for Iraq on the National Security Council under the Bush and Obama administrations. Ollivant has served two tours in the Iraq War, first as the operations officer for the First Battalion, Fifth Cavalry Regiment during OIF II and later as the Chief of Plans for Multi-National Division-Baghdad during the “Surge”, leading the team which wrote the Baghdad Security Plan
Military service.
A former assistant professor at the United States Military Academy's Department of Social Sciences, he is affiliated with a group of military intellectuals, who have been tapped to provide insight and recommendations to General David Petraeus, in what was labeled by Tom Ricks as Petraeus’s “brain trust” or "warrior-intellectuals". Others in this list include, Brigadier General Bill Rapp, Colonel(P) H.R. McMaster, Colonels Peter Monsoor, and Michael Meese, Lieutenant Colonels John Nagl, Mike George, Jen Easterly, Paul Yingling, Bill Ostlund and Charles Miller, as well as Dr. David Kilcullen and Dr. Carter Malkesian.
In her 2008 book, Tell Me How This Ends, Linda Robinson called Ollivant the “right person in the right place at the right time” for his work in devising the operational implementation of the successful Baghdad Security plan.
Military Writings.
In 2006 Ollivant co-authored, with Captain Eric Chewning, an influential article in Military Review, entitled "Producing Victory: Rethinking Conventional Forces in Counterinsurgency Operations", and a 2007 follow-on article, entitled "Producing Victory: a 2007 postscript for implementation", that articulated the need for US forces to abandon sprawling forward operating bases and move into Iraqi communities. The premise of the essay was that counterinsurgency requires military units to simultaneous execute security operations, train local security forces, promote economic development, and foster political institutions. Ollivant and Chewning argued that conventional military units best operate in such an environment when partnered with indigenous security forces co-located among the target population.
The white paper, which was based on Ollivant and Chewning’s experience during combat operations in Iraq in 2004 and 2005, significantly influenced the tactical deployment of US and Iraqi ground forces during the “Surge”. From October 2006 to December 2007 Ollivant was Chief of Plans for Multi National Division-Baghdad and was the lead coalition force planner for the development and implementation of the Baghdad Security Plan in coordination with the Iraqi Security Forces.
In 2008 a review symposium on the FM 3-24 Counterinsurgency Manual sponsored by Perspectives on Politics, Ollivant called for an expansion of irregular warfare doctrine and warned of a potential over reliance on counterinsurgency frameworks in the future. He notes that the absence of a larger framework of warfare tends to pull all instances of irregular war into the counterinsurgency model. This theoretical lacuna presents a difficulty since future conflicts will require peace enforcement, peacekeeping, nation building, and other paradigms to also compete as frameworks for action.
In March 2010, Ollivant and Chewning published an article in The American Interest outlining the military, political, and economic actions necessary for a successful US-Iraqi relationship after the US troop withdrawal.
Other Writings.
Beyond his contributions to military theory, Ollivant wrote a series of articles and book reviews dealing primarily with Catholic political theorists Jacques Maritain and Orestes Brownson, and edited a book of collected essays on the former.
Education & Professional Associations.
Ollivant, a graduate of the US Army’s School of Advanced Military Studies, holds a PhD and MA in political science from Indiana University (political theory and American politics) and a BA in political science from Wheaton College. He is also a life-member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the American Political Science Association.
Media Appearances.
Following his retirement from the military, Ollivant has appeared on media outlets to provide perspective on the current state of military and political affairs in Iraq.

Johannes Gad

Johannes Wilhelm Gad (June 30, 1842–1926) was a German neurophysiologist who was a native of Posen. He was father-in-law to psychiatrist Oskar Kohnstamm (1871-1917).
He was an assistant to Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818–1896) at the physiological institute at the University of Berlin, and later worked under Adolf Fick (1829–1901) at the University of Würzburg. In 1893–1894 he was a visiting lecturer of physiology at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and after returning to Germany, became departmental head at the physiological institute in Berlin. In 1895 he succeeded Ewald Hering (1834–1918) as manager of the department of physiology at the University of Prague. 
Gad is known from his work in experimental physiology. He performed numerous investigations involving electrophysiology, spinal cord functionality, the relationship between lactic acid to muscle contraction, et al. With Edward Flatau (1868–1932), he conducted experiments that were critical of Bastian-Bruns Law in regards to the loss of function following spinal cord injury.
Among his written works was a textbook on human physiology that he co-authored with pharmacologist Jean-François Heymans, called "Kurzes Lehrbuch der Physiologie des Menschen", and a treatise on skin sensation that he published with Alfred Goldscheider (1858–1935), titled "Ueber die Summation von Hautreizen".

McKinley Tennyson

McKinley Tennyson (born March 24, 1979 in Monterey, California) is an American soccer forward who played two seasons with the Portland Timbers and the 2002 playoffs with the Los Angeles Galaxy. He was the 2002 USL First Division points leader.
Youth.
Tennyson grew up the son of an U.S. Army officer, moving every few years. When he was eight, the family settled in Indianapolis, Indiana where Tennyson lived until graduating from North Central High School. Tennyson won four consecutive state championships with the North Central soccer team while being selected as a 1995 and 1996 Parade Magazine High School All American. In 1997, he entered UCLA where he would play on the men’s soccer team until 2000. In 1997, Tennyson and his team mates won the NCAA Men's Soccer Championship and in 2000, he was a second team All American. He graduated with a bachelors degree in sociology in 2004.
National team.
Tennyson earned two caps with the United States U-17 men's national soccer team and six with the U.S. U-20 national team. He was an integral part of the team as it qualified for the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, but was not selected for the roster at the finals.
Professional.
In February 2001, the Columbus Crew selected Tennyson in the 4th round (39th overall) in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. Tennyson did not sign with Columbus, but moved to Europe where he trained with teams in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. On September 5, 2001, he signed with GIF Sundsvall becoming the first African-American from UCLA to play professional soccer in the Swedish Allsvenskan. On August 17, 2001, the Crew traded the rights to Tennyson to the Los Angeles Galaxy in exchange for a 2002 conditional draft pick. In 2002, Tennyson signed with the Portland Timbers of the USL First Division. That season, Tennyson led the Timbers in scoring with 18 goals and 6 assists in 24 games. This was good enough to lead the USL First Division in points and tied him with Fadi Afash and Eduardo Sebrango as joint goals leader. Tennyson was named to the USL All-Star First Team and earned other league awards. On August 15, 2002, following his successful rookie season, Tennyson signed as a developmental player with the Los Angeles Galaxy. On October 2, 2002, he entered his first game with Galaxy and in Major League Soccer, a playoff game against the Kansas City Wizards. He scored 31 seconds later. Tennyson's fortune continued and the Galaxy went on to win the 2002 MLS Soccer Championship beating the New England Revolution in the final. After unsuccessful negoiations with the Galaxy, Tennyson returned to Portland Timbers for the 2003 USL season. In 2003, his production dropped due to a painful hip injury, which required surgery in the offseason. However, Tennyson still finished with 11 goals and 3 assists in 28 games. In 2004, Tennyson signed a two year contract with the Timbers. Unfortunately, Tennyson could not honor the contract and was forced to retire because of the hip surgery and unsuccessful rehabilitation program. McKinley consulted hip specialist at Santa Monica Orthopaedic & Sports Medicine Group and Orthopaedic Medical Group of San Diego to make his final decision.
Post soccer career.
In May 2006, Tennyson completed the Riordan Fellows Program at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, an eight-month fellowship for minorities with outstanding leadership potential. The Riordan Fellows Program targets current college students and recent college graduates who are considering graduate education in business management. Its core purpose is to educate, prepare, and motivate these individuals to competitively apply and succeed in a top MBA program and a career in management. McKinley is currently a Business Development Manager in the Office of Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa for the City of Los Angeles, supporting small business owners with access to capital and contracting opportunities with public/private entities.

Cao Fang (曹方; formerly 曹芳; born May 6, 1983 in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan) is a Chinese indie pop singer/songwriter and melodica player. Some of her songs show the influence of trip hop, bossa nova, and the music of China's ethnic minorities, such as the Jino people, whom she visited in Xishuangbanna as a child. 
In 1996 she went to Kunming to study. In high school, she began writing songs and joined a band. The band recorded a demo, which impressed the musician Xiao Ke, who heard it in approximately 2001 while recording traditional music in Yunnan, but was unable to locate her. Several months later, she came to Beijing for a university students' original music competition, for which Xiao Ke was a judge; she won the awards for best lyrics and best group, and Xiao Ke invited her to join the label he had founded.
Cao moved to Beijing in 2002, where she began working as an assistant at Xiao Ke's label. Soon thereafter she signed to the label. She released her first CD, "Black Perfume" (黑色香水), in 2003. The album was poorly promoted and sold poorly, but she gradually achieved renown via discussion of her works on Chinese blogs.
Her second album, "Meet Me" (遇见我), was released in 2005 on the Tai You Wen Hua (钛友文化) label, selling over 100,000 copies and winning several awards. In the same year, she changed the written form of her name from 曹芳 to 曹方. Her five-track EP, "Farther Than the Sky" (比天空还远), was released on her own label in late 2007.
In 2008, GE Healthcare used her song "In Summer" (在夏天) in a television commercial for Healthcare Re-imagined. She has also composed songs for several other Chinese singers, including Jin Haixin, Qin Hailu, and the first "Super Girl" winner An Youqi.
Her hobbies include drawing and lomography.

Murphys Creek, Queensland

Murphys Creek is a town in Queensland, Australia, located at the foot of the Great Dividing Range. The town's name is correctly spelled without an apostrophe.
History.
Murphys Creek developed as a railway town on the line between the regional city of Toowoomba and settlements to the east, including Helidon, Ipswich and Brisbane. A railway station in the town was opened in 1867, as a part of the Ipswich-Toowoomba segment of the Southern and Western Railway. Based at the foot of the Great Dividing Range, the station and water tank were intended to provide water and services for steam locomotives about to embark on the difficult journey up the steep slopes of the Toowoomba range. The station was named for a creek that ran through the area, that was in turn named for a shepherd who had built a hut in the area around 1864. A correspondent for the Brisbane Courier newspaper around this time described the site as a "feeding place for the engines" travelling to and from Toowoomba.
A small town quickly sprang up around the station, which had grown such an extent that by 1877 tenders had been called for the construction of a booking office and passenger platform at the station. These improvements were completed by 1878. However, in 1887 a fire at the station destroyed the lamp room and ladies' waiting room, and in 1917 the station ceased to be used as a watering station for trains travelling up the range, with watering stations being provided elsewhere on the line (although a 40,000 litre emergency water tank was constructed at the station in 1921 for emergency purposes). 
The need to maintain the Murphys Creek railway station diminished in the second half of the 20th century with the introduction of the diesel-electric locomotive. These new trains were capable of climbing the steep slopes west of Murphys Creek without the requirement for attached locomotives. Steam operations had ceased completely on the line by the mid 1960s, and the station was finally closed in 1992, with the installation of computerised signalling systems removing the last justification for the continued existence of the station. The station buildings were sold to the local progress association in 1993, and the water tank was re-assigned to be used as emergency water storage for the township, as well as for use watering the occasional steam heritage trains that periodically ran from Brisbane to Toowoomba.
Heritage listings.
Murphys Creek has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
Demographics.
At the 2011 census, the town was recorded as having a population of 664 persons, living in 150 occupied dwellings. The median age of the population was 38 years, all of whom reported speaking English primarily at home. 65% of the population of the town were born in Australia, 4.2% in England, 1.3% in Zimbabwe, with the remainder being born in New Zealand, the Philippines or the United States of America.

Game backup device

A game backup device, formerly usually called a copier and more recently a flash cartridge, is a device for backing up ROM information from a video game cartridge to a computer file called a ROM image and playing them back on the real hardware. Recently flash cartridges, especially on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS platforms, only support the latter function; they cannot be used for backing up ROM data. Game backup devices also make it possible to develop homebrew software on video game systems. Game backup devices differ from modchips in that modchips are used in conjunction with systems that use generally available media such as CDs and DVDs, whereas game backup devices are used with systems that use cartridges.
Video game companies consider these devices as a tool for reverse engineering to circumvent copying. Most of the devices are made in China, but they are available globally. Recently, action has been taken by companies such as Nintendo to remove these devices from the marketplace, but the easy dissemination of information and selling of products over the Internet has made it difficult to eradicate this problem. Hobbyists argue that these devices are and should stay legal because they fulfill the need to back up games in case the original is damaged or lost; and because they permit the private development of new software on the device.
In Japan these devices are known as , an umbrella term for any device that enables piracy on game consoles.
History.
The spiritual forefather of copier devices can be traced back to the Famicom Disk System, an official add-on device for the Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Users quickly discovered ways to copy these disks with ordinary home computers of the time and transmit the copied data to others using the emerging electronic bulletin board systems. Nintendo attempted to counter the piracy problem by slightly modifying the hardware in newer revisions, but they were unable to stop the unauthorized copying. Later, the Famicom Disk System was discontinued, supposedly because cartridge technology had caught up in capacity, but the influence of rampant piracy cannot be discounted.
When the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released, Hong Kong based companies were quick to cash in on the same idea. They produced cartridges that fit in the video game console's cartridge slot, but were interfaced with a floppy disk drive through a connecting cable. The copier, as they were called, also had a passthrough slot into which a real game could be inserted. The device, once powered up, could be used to copy the cartridge's ROM data into files on ordinary MS-DOS formatted 3.5" floppy disks and thereafter to play the game from the same disks, without having to rely on the original cartridge being present.
When these devices were introduced to the United States and Europe, video game enthusiasts quickly started swapping the copied games over bulletin board systems. Release groups formed to cater to the need of fresh games, and also to crack the protection that was employed to thwart copying in several games released after copiers became available. Release groups would also add their own intros to games, to advertise their BBSes and new releases.
The copier devices and dissemination of hardware information through BBSes made it possible to start developing software on the video game consoles. The software evolved from crack intros to demos, and finally to home-made games. The homebrew software development scene is still alive and active today on multiple contemporary platforms.
Legality.
Similar to modchips, the legality of these methods is disputed. While they are often advertised for their ability to make legal backups, to be used to play legal homebrew software and are considered a cheap method of development compared to purchasing official development kits, a backup device's potential for software piracy is a major concern to hardware and software manufacturers.
Companies such as Nintendo have fought long legal battles against companies like Bung Enterprises and the makers of the R4DS on the grounds that their products are used primarily for piracy and qualify as theft.

Super UFO series- by UFO Enterprise. Available from 16 to 32 Megabits. 
Compatible with Pro Fighter and Game Doctor file formats. File format extension is 1 to 
8GM.
Game Doctor Series - by Bung Enterprise. Available up to 64 Megabits (and upgradable to 128 Megabits) with 
optional Digital Signal Processor cartridge to run games like Pilot Wings, Super Mario Kart 
and many others. Contrary to misinformation games like Tales of Phantasia, Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Star Fox do not use DSP-1. Tales of Phantasia is a standard cartridge with different a memory map than most games due to a larger size of ROM. Street Fighter Alpha 2 uses the SDD-1 coprocessor chip which primarily is used for graphics decompression. Star Fox uses the Super FX chip which is a RISC processor intended for software rendering 3D graphics used in the game. File format extension is *.078
Multi Game hunter (MGH) by Venus Corp. a dual solution game copier for both Sega Genesis and SNES.
Double Pro Fighter by China Coach Limited is a dual solution game copier for both Sega Genesis and SNES.
Retrode by Retrode UG is a USB interface for both Sega Genesis and SNES cartridges and controllers that can be extended via so-called plug-in adapters to accommodate games for other systems as well.
It is important to note that no commercially produced Backup Device for Super Nintendo can play back games which use additional processing hardware in the cartridge with the sole exception of DSP-1. This is due in part to the way in which these processors operate. It may be possible with some copiers to manage to back up a game using an extra coprocessor chip though. However a very small number of games fall into this category but there are notable games included. Some examples are Mega Man X2, Mega Man X3, Star Fox, Kirby's Dreamland 3, Super Mario RPG, , and more.
Many games are commonly incorrectly said to have extra coprocesser chips or said to have one but the wrong one is named. Games such as Donkey Kong Country and Tales of Phantasia often are incorrectly stated to have these chips.
Nintendo 64.
There are two devices for the Nintendo 64 that plug into the extension port on the bottom of the system, initially intended for the 64DD: the Doctor V64 and the CD64. In addition to playing backups from a CD, they can both be used to create them by copying the information from a cartridge that is plugged into the Nintendo 64. They store the ROM image in internal memory and can be transferred to a computer via a parallel port for distribution elsewhere. The Z64 uses the cartridge slot on the top of the N64 and has a cartridge slot itself for booting backups as well as making backups. It reads from and stores backups on zip diskettes. The NEO N64 Myth Cart was released in December 2009, long after the Nintendo 64 had been discontinued, and is marketed for retro gamers. The NEO N64 Myth Cart connects to a PC using USB, and ROM images are stored in flash memory.
Schematics, PCB designs and source code for a cartridge emulator known as "PVBackup" were released by Valery Pudov.
Backup devices for handhelds.
Game Boy.
For the original Game Boy and its color successor there are numerous external copiers, such as GB Xchanger, which can back up an inserted Game Boy or Game Boy Color cartridge. The GB Xchanger plugs into a computer in order to copy the games, which can later transfer the game(s) back through the copier to a blank flash cartridge.
Game Boy Advance.
Early copiers for the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Micro, like the Flash Advance Xtreme are similar to those used for the original Game Boy, as they are external copiers that use parallel ports to communicate with personal computers.
The copiers eventually made use of USB with products like first generation XG-Flash carts, which also used external copiers, but benefited from faster write speeds than its parallel port predecessors. This technology evolved into onboard external copiers like the EZFlash Advance that used the Game Boy Advance itself as a copier. These USB cables would plug into the GBAs proprietary port used for link cables or accessories like the ereader and when booted while holding Start and Select, would connect to a PC. These version are not compatible with the Game Boy Micro because it uses a different port than the GBA and GBA SP.
Nintendo DS.
There aren't any commercial backup devices for the Nintendo DS that are widely available, yet many devices exist to play backups on a DS. These flashcarts are capapable of using specific software to backup both DS and Game Boy Advance games.
Other Handhelds.
Bung released a copier for the Neo Geo Pocket and the Neo Geo Pocket Color. It resembled their GB Xchanger and it served the same function.
Team Pokeme and Dark Fader both released homemade game backup devices for the Pokémon Mini. Both devices used USB for communicating with a PC.
A copier for the Japan-only handheld, the Wonderswan, as well as the Wonderswan Color and to a lesser extent, the SwanCrystal, was released called the WonderMagic. It uses a parallel port for communication with a PC.

Wildside (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch song)

"Wildside" is a song by American hip-hop group Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. It was released in October 1991 as the second single from their 1991 album "Music for the People". It heavily samples Lou Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side". All vocals on the track are performed by the group's leader Mark Wahlberg.
Content.
The song was written and produced by Boston pioneer rapper M.C. Spice (Amir Quadeer Shakir), and describes the effects of America's greed, violence, and drug addiction on innocent, unsuspecting people. The song tells of the unfortunate events that occur due to the traits mentioned above in a similar way to the Lou Reed song. It referenced two notorious crimes that happened in Boston; the murder-suicide of Charles Stuart and his wife and the murder of 12-year old Tiffany Moore shot as she sat on a stoop during a drive by shooting by a youth gang. Originally recorded and performed by M.C. Spice, "Wildside" aired on Boston's W.I.L.D. Radio for nearly two years before Spice agreed to allow Wahlberg to record the song for the actor's debut album. However, Spice removed content which referenced his best friend, Wesley "DJ Wes" McDougald and Wesley's violent death. M.C. Spice still records under the name Quadeer Shakur and M.C. Spice, and is founder of the world famous BlackBerry Soul Radio online music station.
Chart performance.
"Wildside" followed the success of the group's previous single, "Good Vibrations", and peaked at number 10 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming the group's second and final top-40 single.

Maldon Grain Riots

The Maldon Grain riots of 1629 took place after a particularly poor grain harvest. In March of that year a group of rioters led by one “Captain” Ann Carter, the wife of a butcher boarded a Flemish grain ship. There was a widespread belief at the time that women were beyond the law and that any prosecution could only be made against any man who might lie behind the felony. Refer to Legal rights of women in history. The women and child rioters removed some grain from the ship by filling their caps and gowns.
Captain Ann, seemingly emboldened by her success toured the local area drumming up support among clothing workers. The situation came to a head when a further riot took place on 22 May. This was taken much more seriously by the authorities and attracted the attention of the Privy Council. A special commission was established and Captain Ann was hanged.
The style of Captain was adopted by a number of other female activists during the Seventeenth century. "Captain" Dorothy Dawson organised a protest at Thorpe Moor and "Captain" Kate is recorded at an election meeting in Coventry

Museo Casa Juárez

The Museo de la Lealtad Republicana (Museum of the Republican Loyalty), also known as the Museo Casa Juárez, is a 19th-century building in the city centre of Chihuahua, Chih., Mexico. It housed the constitutional government of President Benito Juárez during his stay in Chihuahua while Maximillian of Habsburg reigned as Emperor of Mexico, supported by the French, and was thus the "de facto" National Palace of Mexico.
History.
In 1826 the location was purchased by the state government to serve as the Palace of Government, a role it fulfilled until the new impressive palace was inaugurated in 1892. On October 12, 1864, President Benito Juárez, fleeing from the French invasion, finally arrived in the city where he decided to establish his government-in-exile.
Juárez lived in and ran the constitutional government from the palace through December 1866. He left Chihuahua when the French forces and the Second Mexican Empire had been almost totally defeated. After that the building reverted to being the Government Palace for the state administration. However, when the new palace was constructed a few blocks away, the Casa Juárez was turned into an educational institution, first as the Escuela Municipal Nro 3 for girls, then redesignated as Escuela Oficial Nro 140, and finally renamed Escuela Benito Juárez, a name it retained from 1926 to 1967, when it was closed.
It wasn't until 1972, during the observance of the centenary of the death of Benito Juárez, that the authorities decided to turn the building into a museum. Many objects and furniture original to the house had been lost long since; however, the state government was, over the years during the planning stage, able to recover original furnishings as well as period pieces similar to those that Juárez had used. In 2000 the restoration was finally complete and the renamed Museo de la Lealtad Republicana was opened to the public.

Acadian redfish

The Acadian redfish ("Sebastes fasciatus"), also known as the Atlantic redfish, is a marine deep-water fish belonging to the family Sebastidae. Found in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, the Acadian redfish lives at depths of between . This fish is colored reddish-orange and can live up to 50 years or more and reach lengths up to .
Distribution and habitat.
The Acadian redfish is native to the waters of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean and its range extends from Virginia, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Nova Scotia, western Greenland and Iceland. It is found at depths varying between . It swims near the seabed in areas with clay-silt or rocky bottoms.
Biology.
The Acadian redfish feeds on a variety of crustaceans, mollusks, and smaller fish. In addition, the Acadian redfish mates in the fall to late winter through means of "ovoviviparous reproduction" with around "15,000 20,000 extruded larvae produced per female" per season. Due to its slow growth rate, low fecundity, harmless nature, tendency to "hit almost any bait," and being considered a great food fish, the redfish has become endangered. Due to conservation efforts, the redfish population has rebounded and the species has been declared fully rebuilt as of June, 2012. The Acadian redfish is preyed on by the halibut, the Atlantic cod, swordfishes and harbor seals.
The Acadian redfish is very similar in appearance to the deepwater redfish "Sebastes mentella". The two species can be distinguished by the number of soft rays in the anal fin, internal examination of the gas bladder, or by genetic testing.

Pearl Cohn Comprehensive High School

Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School (or simply Pearl-Cohn High) is a public magnet high school located in Nashville, Tennessee.
History.
Pearl-Cohn was established in 1983 when Pearl High School and Cohn High School merged. The school was built in 1986 to replace the former Cohn High School and Pearl High School.
Distinctions.
Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, located just off of historic Jefferson Street in north Nashville, is the only entertainment magnet high school in the country. 
Pearl-Cohn includes grades 9–12, and students feed from Bass Middle School. In the 2009-2010 School year, John Early Middle will also feed into the school.
Pearl-Cohn is organized into three small school academies: the Freshman Academy, the Academy of Entertainment Management, and the Academy of Entertainment Communication. Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School provides a full range of courses in preparation for entering a university program or to begin a career. The integrated curriculum includes pathways in Music Business, Stylist and Image Consultants, Music Recording and Broadcasting. Students enter their area of interest in their sophomore year so that they are prepared to meet State and District requirements for them to have three courses in a concentrated area.
On May 8, 2013 the school debuted its state of the art recording studio. This studio has an estimated cost of 1.2 million dollars. Pearl-Cohn is the first school in the nation to house a student-run label affiliated with a major record label. This partnership is through Warner Music Group. Students, in partnership with Warner Music, run a record label which takes artists from song creation to production and distribution. Students operate the label just like the corporate model, with profits going toward music education.
The studio features equipment like that found in commercial studios — a 32-channel mixing console, effect processors and two editing suites.
2009–10 Cluster Changes.
In the 2009–10 School year the Pearl-Cohn Cluster included a larger geographic area that was currently zoned to Hillsboro and Hillwood High schools. The plan was controversial in the manner that many economically disadvantaged and African American students will be zoned away from more diverse high schools.

Petticoat Hill

Petticoat Hill is the name of a 1,180 foot (361 m) hill and a open space reservation located in Williamsburg, Massachusetts in the eastern Berkshire Mountains. The reservation, occupying the east side of the hill, is managed by The Trustees of Reservations (TTOR), a non-profit conservation organization. The hill and reservation are characterized by steep slopes largely wooded with northern hardwood forest species, particularly eastern hemlock.
Geography and ecology.
Petticoat Hill rises nearly above downtown Williamsburg; its subordinate summits include Scott Hill, 1,027 ft (313 m), on which are located the reservation and trails; and Unquomonk Hill, (1,083 ft (330 m). The east and south sides of Petticoat Hill drain into Unquomonk Brook, thence into the Mill River, the Connecticut River, and Long Island Sound. The north and west sides of the hill drain into Meekin Brook, thence into the Mill River.
Petticoat Hill species include American black bear, coyote, and white-tailed deer. Flora includes spring wildflowers such as red trillium, trout lily, white baneberry, and wild ginger. Tree species include American basswood, black birch, hornbeam, Northern red oak, pignut hickory, shagbark hickory, red maple, sugar maple, white ash, and white pine. There are trees on the property that are over tall and some that are in diameter or more.
History.
Petticoat Hill receives its name from a family of seven daughters, who, according to local tradition, lived on the hill and regularly hung their petticoats from a laundry line where they "wavein the wind [and were visible for miles around when the did their laundry on Mondays."
By the early 19th century, the area around Petticoat Hill was the most populated section of Williamsburg. The current reservation property, except for a field of boulders, was mostly sheep pasture. When farming interests moved to the Midwest by the late 1800s, the hill gradually reverted to forest. Old stone walls, foundations, and cellar holes are the only remains of the hill's former use.
The east side of Petticoat Hill was donated to The Trustees of Reservations in 1906 by Mrs. Edward W. Nash in memory of her husband. Additional land was donated in 1924.
Recreation.
The Petticoat Hill reservation is open to hiking, cross country skiing, picnicing, and hunting (in season); TTOR manages a loop trail through the property. Another trail, "Locke's Loop", is managed by the local non-profit Williamsburg Woodland Trails organization with permission from private landowners; it joins the reservation hiking trail near the summit of Scott Hill, passes over the crest, and descends through private property before returning to the reservation. No marked trails ascend to the actual summit of Petticoat Hill.

Jehangira

Jehangira is located at 33°57'46N 72°13'17E with an altitude of 281 Meters (925 ft). The town is situated on the bank of River Kabul before its convergence with Indus River near Attock. The river divides Jehangira into two union councils and districts. Eastern Jehangira is under Swabi district while western Jehangira is under the administration of Nowshera district of Kyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Northern Province of Pakistan).
Boundaries.
Wide boundaries of Jehangira town touch the mountains of Khawri behind Jehangira Railway station in the west. The southern shore of Indus river sets the border with Pujab (Attock district). Tordhair town & Ala Dher Village on the east and village Mian-Esa and Jalbai are located in the North of Jehangira.
Climate.
The climate of Jehangira town is similar to Islamabad but some time more humid due to the streams of Kabul and Indus Rivers. In the summer days, chain of Rocky Mountains and desolate area in the northwest brings hot dusty winds in the area.
History.
According to the British record of 1871 for land information management in Indo-Pak, Jehangir Khan Awan founded this town in 1680 when Afzal Khan Khattak was the chieftain of Khattak tribe (Nephew of Khushal Khan Khattak). In the beginning it was known as Jehangir village but gradually became famous as JEHANGIRA.
In 1818 during Ranjit Singh invasion on Peshawar valley, Sikhs badly ruined Jehangira. But soon after, the Chieftain Abbas Khan Khattak, succeeded in reconciliation with Sikhs, as a result, Khattaks and Awans stopped resistance against Sikhism and returned to their homes with peace. Sikhs built an army post inside Jehangira to control the area and launched boats service across the river to connect the area with Peshawar.
During British colonialism, as like their predecessors, they built a check post and police station at the bank of river Kabul and fastened a floating bridge over the river. Since the Partition (1947), the local government of Pakistan has been using the British's check-post as "Jehangira Police Station" and in 1970 an enforced hollow-core concrete bridge was constructed over the River, known as Jehangira bridge. The bridge first time came under water for few hours on 30th July, during 2010 floods.
As the time passed, the village became more populated, most of the adjacent areas overlapped edge to edge, as a result many new markets and industries emerged in the area and Jehangira arose as Jehangira town.
On July 3, 2005, the NWFP government had announced the delimitation of union council Jehangira, which merged it with Nowshera district from Swabi district and renamed it Jehangira-2. But the Supreme court of Pakistan, dismissed the decision and reinstated the previous position of the town.
People and cultures.
Inhabitants of Jehangira town is a mixture of Pashtoon clans migrated from different parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Awans and Khattacks both are the fundamental communities of Jehangira town. But most of the natives have lost their ethnic identities unlike other Pushtoon tribes. Khattak are known by their sub tribe like Khan-khel, Akor-khel, Kaka-khel, Faqir-khel, Fateh-khani, chacha-khel, Akhund-zad and many more. Moreover a non-pushtoon community is also playing a major role in local societies of both union councils. Recently migrated families are Gujars, Mohmands and Khattacks; resided on agricultural lands at the east of town.needed
Population units.
As mentioned above, several hamlets were incorporated with Jehangira, their names with brief introductions are as follow:
Jehangira village (Dist. Swabi): Also known as Pushtoons Village because of Pushto language,this is the fundamental population of the town since 1680.
Manrdgan village(Dist. Swabi): Secondary population resided by Sikh-Raj in 1818 for the purpose of boating services in Kabul River. "Mardgan" is a Pushto word which means "Boatmen or Sailors"; majority of the people of this village speak Hindco but all of them are not Margan or "Boatmen", while some pushtoon families are also found among them.
New hamlets (Dist. Swabi): There are some newly populated areas like Mera, Kodray, Hayatabad, New-Nehr, Marab, Budai-Kamar, Garha, Karkhana, Zorh Nehr, Shekh baba and Mia-Esa road etc.
Dubandi Bazaar (Dist. Nowshera): Located near the junction of Swabi road with historical highway Jurnaily 
Road. In the beginning, there were few temporary shelters for foodstuffs and tea sellers at bus stand and Railway station of Jehangira. Gradually, as the population grew-up, Dubandi became a real Bazaar and a famous shopping center in the area.
Dherri Khattak (Dist. Nowshera): Located in the north near Jehangira railway station, famous for Volleyball game. The majority of Dehri Khattak is Hindco speak.
Educational institutes.
Dozens of government and private schools for boys and girls are running under each Union council and some technical & vocational training institutes and Intermediate colleges are running in Western Jehangira.
Hospitals and health care centers.
A Health Care unit is working under each union council but there are many private clinics and medical centers that serve for the sake of human health in the area.
Mausoleums and cemeteries.

<doc id="18899064" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18899064" title="Pseudotropheus sp. &quot;acei&quot;">
Pseudotropheus sp. &quot;acei&quot;

Pseudotropheus acei (also known as Yellow-tail acei) is a Mbuna from Lake Malawi that grows to around 7 inches in length. There are two different varieties found, the most common "Pseudotropheus acei" ("Msuli"), and the white-tail "Pseudotropheus acei" ("Ngara"). Like most Mbuna, it dwells in shallower waters, however it will sometimes go near the surface, which is very uncommon for Mbunas. It is a very common fish for fish-keepers. It gets its common name from its blue body and yellow tail. Originally discovered in 1922 by Regan, the Acei was originally classified as "Pseudotropheus", but was later changed to "Gephyrochromis" and then back again. It prefers the sandy and rock filled shoreline where sunken logs are easily accessed. This species has developed the advantage of being able to harvest algae from submerged logs and roots. They are equipped with typical Gephyrochromid cuspid-like teeth that are flat for removing epixlyic or epilithic algae from wood. In the lake, schools of 30-50 individuals surrounding a large log are not uncommon, however in the rocky areas; schools usually consist of 3-10 individuals
Fish-keeping.
These mbunas are omnivorous but prefer plants and algae in their diet. If they are to be fed staple, then any food made for African Cichlids will do. Most vegetable matter will work as well. These fish are possibly the most peaceful fish in the Mbuna family, and because of this it is not necessary a male-female ratio. Their preferred water conditions are a pH of above 7.5 and a temperature of 78–82 °F (26–28 °C).
Breeding.
Pseudotropheus acei is an ovophile mouth brooder, which means that the female will incubate and hatch the eggs in her buchal pouch, and then continue to hold the fry until the yolk sacs have been consumed. A typical holding period for this Cichlid is three weeks, and the female will not eat during this time. Females can have around 50 fry per spawning, although this can greatly vary depending on her size and experience. Once the eggs are done incubating the female spits them out and they are left to fend for themselves.
Anatomy.
Acei like most mbunas have a very long intestine so they can live of a few bites of algae a day. These fish are at high risk for Malawi bloat. Bloat is caused by a protozoan that multiplies when a fish is under stress or consuming an improper diet. The protozoans multiply enough that they cause blockages in the intestines, so neither food nor gases can pass, causing them to become bloated. The bloat eventually damages their liver, swim bladder, and kidneys so much that they die in 24–78 hours. Acei have bicuspid teeth like the rest of the pseudotropheus genus.

Antioch Comprehensive High School

Antioch High School (AHS) is a public high school located in Antioch, Tennessee, USA. It is located at 1900 Hobson Pike. It is a comprehensive high school for grades 9-12 and one of 19 high schools administered by Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools.
History.
Antioch High School has a history dating back to 1932. To serve the community of Antioch, the Board of Education purchased a tract of land in southeastern Davidson County and erected a brick school building. In the fall of 1933, the four-year high school formally opened. The first graduating class had 24 students and a faculty of seven.
After many years of overcrowding, a larger facility (95 classrooms) was built to replace the old High School and in the fall of 1997 the high school moved to its current location. The new facility opened its doors to a student community of 1,857 and 90 teachers. Currently, Antioch High School has an enrollment of 2,454 and 132 teachers. Despite the newer facility and the building of a second high school, Cane Ridge High School, to serve the Antioch area, AHS still suffers from overcrowding. An increase in the student population for the 2002-2003 school year necessitated the use of the teachers’ lounge, TV studio, and hospitality room as instruction areas. Antioch also has 25 portable classrooms, and three teachers "float" between classrooms due to the crowded conditions in the building and the increase in enrollment.
The old High School building, located at 5050 Blue Hole Road, is now home to Antioch Middle School. According to statistics released in 2011 by MNPS, Antioch High School's student body demographic is 47% African American, 25% White, 24% Hispanic, 3% Asian and 1% other.
Athletics.
There are many sports available for students. All sporting events are overseen by the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA).

National Museum of Catholic Art and History

The National Museum of Catholic Art and History is a museum in Washington, D.C focusing on Roman Catholic art. It was formerly located in East Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. It was founded by Christina Cox in 1995.
Cox opened the first Catholic museum in the United States after receiving a blessing from then-Pope John Paul II. The museum has received support from the Archdiocese of New York although there is no connection between the two. Following controversy regarding the museum's status as a charity and its collection of funds, the archdiocese sought unsuccessfully to have the word "Catholic" removed from the museum's name.
The museum's collection aims to cover the many facets of Catholic art, although in 2003 Joseph Berger wrote that it lacked a unifying theme, relying instead on donated works.
The museum's original location was in the Olympic Towers on Fifth Avenue, near St. Patrick's Cathedral, a location that allowed the museum to take advantage of Christmas celebrations in the neighborhood. The museum moved several times, including to locations near Radio City Music Hall. In 2002, faced with increasing rents, the museum moved to E. 115th Street, the former home of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Shrine which had recently been spared significant damage from a fire. The museum received around four million dollars in grants from New York State, in the hopes that it would help revitalize East Harlem.
The museum was credited with helping to shape and develop the so-called "new Harlem" that was evolving as a result of increased money and the gentrification of the neighborhood. Following an $8 million renovation, the museum also planned an exhibit on the history of East Harlem, acknowledging the role of the church that housed it in the formerly Italian neighborhood that is now known as Spanish Harlem.
The museum announced on 17 May 2010 that it was closing, and hoped to move to Washington, D.C. On January 27, 2012 the museum filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation) in the Southern District of New York as case number 12-10331. The Voluntary Petition listed assets of less than $50,000 and liabilities of $1 million to $10 million.
In 2012 the museum began moving to its new location on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington D.C.
Collections.
The museum has 11 galleries of art and artifacts, including traveling exhibits and works on art on loan by private collectors. The collection of old masters includes "The Betrayal of Christ" by Anthony van Dyck. The contemporary galleries have a permanent exhibition called "The Morsel "(Last Supper) by Paul A. Gatto, "The Blue Madonna", as well as works by Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg. The museum's Catholic history galleries describe the voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World, the success of the United States Declaration of Independence in an 8 ft oil painting by Russian-born portrait painter Victor Korolev and his portrait of Archbishop John Carroll. The permanent collection includes a life-size Nativity of Jesus from the Philippines.

<doc id="18899213" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18899213" title="Stanton v. Stanton">
Stanton v. Stanton

Stanton v. Stanton, is a United States Supreme Court case which struck down Utah's definitions of adulthood as a violation of equal protection: females reached adulthood at 18; males at 21.
Background.
The case had started in Utah state court. A divorced father stopped paying child support for his daughter when she turned eighteen, so the daughter's mother went to court to ask for support until both the daughter and the son reached twenty-one. Utah divorce court ruled against the mother, and the Utah Supreme Court held that there was a "reasonable basis" for the differential: women matured earlier and married younger; men had a greater need for education. The Utah court stated in its opinion that the basis for the law, though an "old notion," was not unconstitutional.
Opinion.
Justice Blackmun wrote for the majority. He found a violation of equal protection and said the law failed under any standard, including rational basis (the Supreme Court's lowest standard of review). The decision remained in the context of child support, without considering different ages for males and females in other contexts.
The "Stanton" decision placed the Court on record as declaring that society's stereotypes were not a legitimate basis for official policies that treated men and women differently.
Blackmun wrote: "A child, male or female, is still a child... No longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas... If a specified age of minority is required for the boy in order to assure him parental support while he attains his education and training, so, too, is it for the girl."

Chicago Life Insurance Company v. Needles

Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Needles, , was a writ of error regarding a denial of a motion and final judgment rendered perpetually enjoining Chicago Life Ins. Co. from further prosecution of its business. From that judgment a writ of error was prosecuted to the supreme court of the state, where, among other things, was assigned for error the refusal of the court of original jurisdiction to adjudge that the said statutes of Illinois were in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The judgment of the inferior court was in all things affirmed by the supreme court of the state, and from that judgment of affirmance the present writ of error is prosecuted.
An Act of the General Assembly of Illinois created a body politic and corporate by the name of the Travelers Insurance Company, with authority to carry on the business of insuring persons against the accidental loss of life or personal injury sustained while traveling by railways, steamers, and other modes of conveyance. Another Act formally accepted by the company, its name was changed to that of the Chicago Life Insurance Company, and was invested with power to make insurance upon the lives of individuals, and of persons connected by marital relations, to those applying for insurance, or in whom the applicant had a pecuniary interest as creditor or otherwise, "to secure trusts, grants, annuities, and endowments, and purchase the same in such manner and for such premiums and considerations as the board of directors or executive committee shall direct." A general law of the state, approved March 26, 1869, and which took effect July 1, 1869, entitled "An act to organize and regulate the business of life insurance" 
Under the authority conferred by the latter statute, the auditor caused an examination to be made by the chief clerk of the insurance department of the state into the condition of this company. That officer reported that it had been doing a losing business for several years, was insolvent within the meaning of the statute, and that immediate steps should be taken to appoint a receiver, to the end that the affairs of the company be wound up as quickly as possible, as being for the best interests of its policyholders. As the result of that examination, the present proceedings were commenced by the auditor in the Circuit Court of Cook County under the said act of 1874. The petition filed by him shows that in his opinion the condition of the company rendered its further continuance in business hazardous to the insured. He prayed that the company be enjoined from further prosecuting its business; that a receiver be appointed to take charge of its real estate and effects, and that such other relief be granted as should be meet. An injunction was issued and a receiver appointed with authority to take possession of the property of the company, the latter being directed to execute all conveyances necessary to vest in him full title to all its property, assets, and choses in action. The company, by its answer, put the plaintiff on proof of all the material allegations of the petition. 
At the final hearing, it moved the court, upon written grounds, for a final decree in its behalf; one of which was that the statutes of the state under which these proceedings were had were in violation of the Constitution of the United States in that they impaired the obligation of the contract between the state and the company, as well as of the contracts between the company and its policyholders and creditors. This motion was denied and a final judgment rendered perpetually enjoining the company from further prosecution of its business. 
The whole argument in behalf of the company proceeds upon the erroneous assumption that this Court has authority to determine whether the facts make a case under the statutes of 1869 and 1874, and if it be found that they did not, that it must enforce the right of the company to continue in business, despite the final judgment to the contrary by the courts of the state which created it, whereas we have only to inquire whether the statutes in question impair the obligation of any contract which the company has with the state or violate any other provision of the national Constitution. Being of opinion that they are not open to any objection of that character, the judgment must be affirmed without any reference to the weight of the evidence upon any issue of fact made by the pleadings.
The judgment was affirmed.

<doc id="18899246" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18899246" title="American Gymnosophical Association">
American Gymnosophical Association

The American Gymnosophical Association (AGA) was organized circa 1930 by Herman and Katherine Soshinski. It was one of 3 spin-off groups from the League for Physical Culture that had been organized by Kurt Barthel in 1929. Dr. Maurice Parmelee, Professor of sociology, City College of New York was its honorary President.
Katherine and Herman Soshinki arrived in the US in 1923 from Germany as librarians of the New York Public Library. They had become familiar with nudist practice in Germany from 1918–23. Once in the US they continued their subscription to the German newspapers where they saw the advertisements by Kurt Barthel soliciting German residents to assist in the formation of nudist groups. They joined the group, the League of Physical Culture spending time with others at leased farms in Westchester County in summers and gymnasiums and pools in New York in the winter before organizing the AGA group. Due to the anti-nudity laws in New York they searched for a location which led them to Rock Lodge. Membership soon grew to over 300 and national nudist conventions were held at Rock Lodge Club in 1936, 1938, and 1941. 
Rock Lodge, the summer home of the American Gymnosophical Associates, compared most favorably with the other camps, not only in the scenic beauties, conveniences, and housing facilities, but all with the personnel of the membership body at large, as well as the directors in particular. The group had an office in Manhattan and by 1933 had leased an camp in the foothills of the Catskills and accepted another farm of nearer the city. Miss Ruth Winkler was the secretary of the Association. 
Like other groups interested in Nudism, the American Gymnosophical Associates, maintained a well-equipped gymnasium in New York City during the winter months, where calisthenics and other exercises were indulged in under expert guidance.
A 1932 painting by artist Richard Ederheimer (1878–1959) indicating nudist activities at Rock Lodge Club is in the collection of the NJ Historical Society.
In 1936 looking to expand its operation in the winter months the AGA advertised for a secretary for its new camp Mossy Oaks located in Lake Thonotossa, Tampa, Florida which was, at that time, Tampa's only nudist colony. By 1939 both locations had been approved for National American Sunbathing Association charter, Oakland, NJ. The AGA had to discontinue renting country places in Florida in 1943 due to financial difficulties due 
to the war.
The original AGA logo contains the words mens sana in corpore sano (a healthy mind in a healthy body). In an early AGA publication at Camp Rock Lodge in Stockholm, New Jersey are the statements "So perfect a paradise for the practice of nudism has not many parallels in America. It is all ours! The whole lake and miles of winding paths over the mountain-ranges!" "Back to nature, but not too far back". Rock Lodge Club continues to operate as a non-profit nudist co-operative club at the same location.
The AGA was inspired by the idea that nude sunbathing was a healthy way of life. This belief seems to have first gained popularity in Germany in the 1890s following the publication of two influential books, Heinrich Pudor's "The Cult Of The Nude" and Richard Ungewitter's "Die Nacktheit" (Nakedness), a utopia of nude living.
In the early 1920s while in Germany, Dr. Parmelee researched the movement having read reference to it in a book written by Havelock Ellis on sex and society in 1912. He obtained literature on the subject and then was able to visit and take part in the nudist groups that had formed in Germany. It was during this time he realized he had opportunity to observe and study a significant movement from a psychological and sociological aspect and decided and was encouraged to write a book on social nudism. 
Back in New York during the winter of 1923–24 Dr. Parmelee wrote the book "The New Gymnosophy" the first edition of which was published in 1927 by F.H. Hitchcock, NY with his agreed upon financial assistance. He is the author of the first book on Nudism in the English language. He also wrote a paper entitled "Nacktkultur Under National Socialism.
Dr. Maurice Parmelee, was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1882. He received doctorate degrees from Yale and Columbia universities and taught Anthropology, Sociology and Economics at the universities of Kansas, Missouri and Minnesota and is the author of over 15 books. 
In his later years Dr. Parmelee founded the American Gymnosophical Society, an Illinois chartered non-profit, tax exempt organization which published a 4-page brochure entitled "Gymnosophy". The pamphlet states the society was given affiliation in 1952 with the Societe Internationale de Gymnosophie which itself was founded in 1926 by Kene D'Mongeot in France. In 1952 Dr. Parmelee had retired from government service. 
Described within AGS pamphlet is "What is Gymnosophy?":
Gymnosophy is a philosophy of Nudism and Natural Living, based on the scientific principals of cultural evolution. Gymnosophy embodies the enjoyment of all of the beneficent aspects of nature of which mankind is in a large part deprived and the utilization of every beneficial product of culture. Gymnosophy endeavors to regain what mankind has lost through civilization without rejecting anything of human, social or cultural value.
The enjoyment of nature is an end in itself more than any other human pursuit, and is therefore the most satisfying of pleasures. It has nothing to do with profit, competition and communism or most of the characteristic activities of our civilization. The enjoyment of nature is closely related to the desire for and maintenance of perfect health, which is in itself, the most natural of pursuits.
The most intimate and satisfying enjoyment of nature can be attained only when naked, because then there’s no thing between man and nature and he feels himself wholly a part of nature.
When Gymnosophy is practiced by both sexes together it satisfies the normal desire to see the opposite completely, and furnishes the most natural form of human association.
Thus the Gymnosophist is encouraged to develop beautiful and physical perfection instead of concealing ugliness with clothes.
Gymnosophy is a way of life, aiming at maximum fulfillment through the cultivation of Nudism and Natural Living. It is not a new sect, but the outcome of a long tradition that has inspired many of the world’s thinkers and creative artists. Class and caste distinctions would disappear to a large extent, as well as many oppressive religious, legal and sartorial restrictions. Gymnosophy would restore to the body the importance and dignity to which it is entitled.”

Sean Lien

Sean Lien Sheng-wen (; born February 4, 1970 in Tainan, Taiwan, Republic of China) is a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang, the current ruling party in Taiwan. He was briefly chairman of the Taipei Smart Card Corporation, the company which operates EasyCard, payment system for the Taipei Metro. 
Biography.
Lien is the eldest son of Lien Chan, a former chairman of the Kuomintang and former Vice President of the Republic of China. Although military service is required for all males in Taiwan, Sean Lien never served; reasons for his failure to serve have never been made public. He earned a law degree at Fu Jen Catholic University in Taiwan and a Master of Laws at Columbia University in the United States.. He became a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang in 2005. In 2008, Lien was appointed as chairman of the Taipei Smart Card Corporation by Taipei mayor Hau Lung-bin. He resigned the chairmanship in 2010 allegedly for health reasons. It seems that for most of his adult life he has been unemployed. 
Annette Lu is among those who have called upon him to reveal whether he currently holds or previously has held foreign nationality or permanent residence status.Responding to Lu, he denied that he had a green card when working in the US: he said that we was using a short-term "work visa," though he did not specify what type of work visa, nor did he categorically deny ever having had permanent residency to any foreign country. 
2010 attempted assassination.
On the eve of municipal elections November 26, 2010, Sean Lien was shot in the face at close range while campaigning in Yonghe, Taipei County (now New Taipei City). The Banqiao Prosecutors' Office denied that the shooting had been staged. That he suffered no serious damage has been described as a "medical miracle." No details of his treatment nor any of his medical records were made public.
The bullet allegedly entered through Lien's left cheek and exited from his right temple. He was immediately rushed to the National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei. A suspect named Lin Zheng-wei (林正偉) was immediately arrested and questioned by the police. He was alleged to be a local gang member.
Police revealed that the 48 year-old suspect had previously been arrested for drug possession. A 29 year-old disabled audience member named Huang Yun-sheng (黃運聖) attending the campaign event was struck in the head by a stray bullet and taken to Cardinal Tien Hospital in Yonghe where he died from his wounds.
Two different statements were made between the gunman and Sean Lien. According to the gunman, he had mistaken Sean Lien for another target Chen Hong-yuan (陳鴻源) who was said to be in a land dispute with him. Though Chen Hong-yuan has denied this, saying he did not know who the gunman was in a press conference. In a different statement, according to Sean Lien, the gunman called his name out and swore at him before firing the shot.
The media has compared this case to the 2004 3-19 shooting incident when president Chen Shui-bian was shot.

Sebastian Municipal Airport

Sebastian Municipal Airport is a public-use airport located west of the central business district of the city of Sebastian in Indian River County, Florida, United States. The airport is publicly owned.
History.
Similar to other airfields established in Florida during World War II, the approximate 1,025-acre airport was built by the United States Navy in 1943 (known then as Roseland Satellite Field or Outlying Field Roseland) in support of naval flight training operations at nearby Naval Air Station Vero Beach and Naval Air Station Melbourne. The military paid approximately $1,300 for the property in 1943. Inactivated as a naval facility following the end of World War II, the aviation facility was transferred by the War Assets Administration, as part of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, on January 29, 1959, to the City of Sebastian. Upon taking responsibility, a provision was written in reference to the Federal Surplus Property Act, that the airport would be used without unfair discrimination solely for aviation purposes. This provision provided that the property be given back to the United States in the event of noncompliance with any terms and conditions of the deed.
Since its acquisition in 1959, Sebastian Municipal Airport (now 620 acres) has been maintained and operated by the City of Sebastian. Since the transfer of ownership from the U.S. Government, Sebastian Municipal Airport has undergone numerous facility changes and improvements. The noted championship Sebastian Municipal Golf Course was built in 1981 on a 155-acre plot of land occupying a large portion of the airport property and local area flight training greatly increased operations at the airport in the mid to late 1980s. Currently, a Fixed Based Operator (FBO) occupys the west side of the airfield, and frequent skydiving activity accounts for a large portion of operations at the airport. The addition of a number of commercial and private general aviation hangars and related aprons were developed along the west quadrant of the field. No identifiable existing structures remanin from the airport's days as a naval installation.

Bolalar originally consisted of Bahodir Poʻlatov, Husan Sodiqov (Tohir's brother), Javohir Zokirov, Nargiza Zokirova, Ruslan Sharipov, Tofik Marduxaev, Toir Odilov, and Tohir Sodiqov. The name of the band, "Bolalar," means "children" or "boys" in Uzbek. In Uzbek slang it also means "guys". 
The band members were influenced by the Uzbek rock and roll singer Davron Gʻoipov and the then-popular Russian band Laskoviy Mai. Tohir Sodiqov and Yuri Shatunov, the lead singer of Laskoviy Mai, performed together in Tashkent in 2009.
Bolalar performed to a large audience for the first time in February 1990. In January 1990, they recorded their first album, "Esingdami seni?" ("Do You Remember?"). The group's artistic director and composer was originally Ruslan Sharipov. Over the years all of the original members left the band one after another and currently Sodiqov is the only remaining original member. However, the band members occasionally perform together. Tohir Sodiqov has launched a successful solo career. He usually writes both the music and lyrics to his songs.
Discography.
Bolalar released their first album, "Esingdami seni?" ("Do You Remember?"), in January 1990. On January 22, 2007, the band released their album "The Very Best of the Fontana Years" on iTunes. To date Tohir Sodiqov and Bolalar have released over 280 songs, 10 music videos, and 28 albums. Since the mid-2000s Sodiqov has been releasing songs as a solo artist. Still, the band members perform together from time to time.
Music style.
Bolalar's music has been associated mostly with pop rock and experimental rock. Bolalar have combined different musical styles over the years. While their songs were mostly pop-rock at the beginning, they have written more heavy songs over their prolific career. Their more recent songs are more mature and serious, but less heavy.
Tohir Sodiqov.
Bolalar's singer and leader Tohir Sodiqov was born in the old part of Tashkent in 1973. Together with his friends Bahodir Poʻlatov and Javohir Zokirov, and under artistic directing of Ruslan Sharipov, Tohir Sodiqov founded the band Bolalar in 1989, the year of his school graduation. Tohir Sodiqov has also founded his own record label, Kelajak Records. He has won dozens of awards and nominations such as "The Distinguished Artist of Uzbekistan", "Nihol", and "Tarona."
Awards and accolades.
Bolalar received a Tarona, an accolade given to recognize outstanding achievement in the music industry of Uzbekistan, for Best Song in 2001 and two more Tarona awards for Best Band in 2001 and 2002. Tohir Sodiqov, the long-time lead singer of Bolalar, is a Meritorious Artist of Uzbekistan. Bolalar is among the few Central Asian bands to have given concerts in the United States and to have released albums on iTunes.

Groves High School (Georgia)

Robert W. Groves High School (commonly known as Groves High School or GHS) is a public secondary school located in Garden City, Georgia, United States, serving students in grades 9–12. The school is part of Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools, with admission based primarily on the locations of students' homes.
In 2007, the school had about 1400 students.
History.
Long known as “the pride of the Westside,” Groves High School has a rich community tradition that dates back to its founding in 1958. Established to serve the young people and families of West Chatham County, the school is named for Robert W. Groves, a prominent business and civic leader in the county. Besides his powerful role in business and his many commercial and community activities, Groves took particular concern for the youth of the area and their educational needs. To that end, he was an avid supporter, both financially and morally, for many programs at the school.
Since its inception, some Groves High School’s fondest and best attributes are the strong bonds it shares with the community and its residents. For decades, generations of Chatham County residents have been proud to send their children to this institution. Today, many a Groves Rebel can count him or her self as one whose parents and perhaps even grandparents were once Groves students as well. Ask any longtime West Chatham County resident where he or she went to school and many will say Groves. This includes many prominent figures in community, business, politics, and education. In fact, it is true that many a Groves faculty member is him or her self a graduate of the school and proud to return to contribute to the past and future of its students and legacy.

South Bridge is a bridge in Edinburgh, Scotland. Largely appearing to be a street, rather than a bridge, at its deck level, it starts at the High Street and finishes at Chambers Street/Infirmary Street. Of its nineteen arches, only the largest, over the Cowgate, is visible. Below deck level are many buildings and vaults, the latter now something of a tourist attraction. Many of the buildings on the deck level have further entrances (and sometimes entirely separate functions) at the level of the streets below the bridge.

Susi Air

PT ASI Pujiastuti Aviation, operating as Susi Air, is a scheduled and charter airline based in Pangandaran, West Java, Indonesia. Sixty percent of the airline's operation serves commercial regular routes and pioneer routes while the rest is charter flights. The company currently operates from several main bases across the Indonesian archipelago. Susi Air is listed in category 2 by Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority for airline safety quality.
History.
Susi Air was established in late 2004 by Susi Pudjiastuti, it was originally set up to transport the fisheries cargo of sister company PT ASI Pudjiastuti, because land transportation to Jakarta takes around 12 hours and its too long for fresh and live fishes and lobster.
The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake triggered devastating Tsunami's along the Western coast of Sumatra. The 2 new Cessna Grand Caravan's that had just been ordered by Susi Air were very quickly pressed into service transporting equipment and medicine for aid agencies. Susi Air aircraft is the first plane lands in Aceh after Tsunami. Along 2005 Susi's planes are chartered by NGOs in Aceh and makes cash cow which makes possible to buy a plane in 2006.
In 2006 a third Grand Caravan was added which enabled the company to begin scheduled services out of Medan, capital of North Sumatra. In late 2006 this aircraft was moved to Jayapura, Papua, to establish a base in what is one of the more challenging flying environments in the world.
A fourth Grand Caravan was added to the fleet in early 2007 along with the addition of a new type, the Diamond Twin Star, for use on charter flights as well as opening up the possibility for training of their own pilots. By the end of 2007 another 4 Grand Caravans had been added to the fleet along with the addition of 2 of a further type for the company, the Pilatus Turbo Porter.
In 2008 a Diamond Diamond Star was added to the fleet for use by the Susi Flying School based at the company headquarters in Pangandaran, West Java thus furthering the company's commitment to train local pilots. The ninth Grand Caravan arrived in May continuing the steady growth of the company. September 2008 saw the arrival of the tenth Grand Caravan. In October the Diamond Star aircraft suffered an Engine Failure and successfully made a forced landing near Bandung.
The first Garmin G1000 cockpit Grand Caravan arrived in April 2009, another followed shortly after. July 2009 saw the arrival of the first Piaggio Avanti.
Susi Air is known within Indonesia for hiring its pilots from overseas and mainly from Western Countries due to the lack of Indonesia pilots trained in Indonesia. Indonesia has strict rules of the amount of foreign professionals any one company can employ. In a news article in 2011 Susi Pujiastuti stated that out of her 179 pilots 175 were from overseas.
Destinations.
Susi Air operates charter flights from its 4 main bases in Medan (North Sumatra), East Jakarta (Jakarta), Balikpapan (East Kalimantan) and Jayapura (Papua). Daily scheduled flights are operated out of Medan to Ngan Raya Airport (Meulaboh), Lasikin Airport (Simeulue Island), Silangit Airport and Aek Godang Airport.
Susi Air operates the following services (at April 2011):
Fleet.
Susi Air is the largest operator of Cessna Grand Caravans in the Asia Pacific region which make up the majority of the company's fleet:
Incidents and accidents.
In October 2008, a Diamond DA-40 (registration PK-VVL) from Susi Air made an emergency landing on a firing range in the hilly Army Infantry Training Center compound, some 40 kilometers from the West Java provincial capital Bandung. The pilot was forced to make an emergency landing because of a fuel pump failure. The aircraft's propeller gear was damaged after hitting the ground on the uneven grass field. Besides the Pilot, the airplane was carrying two mechanics to fix another Susi Air airplane that had broken down at Nusawiru airport.
An investigation into this accident was conducted by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, which found that the pilot was not licensed in Indonesia, and that the accident was caused by fuel starvation due to the failure of a fuel pump. The committee said that Susi Air should ensure all pilots have sufficient licenses and that the engine manufacturer, Thielert, should review its engines in order to prevent similar incidents.
On 9 September 2011 a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan (PK-VVE) was destroyed when it crashed in the Pasema District, Indonesia. Both pilots were killed.
The airplane was carrying four drums of diesel fuel and some goods from Wamena to a remote airstrip.
It failed to arrive at the destination. The wreckage was found in mountainous terrain in the Yahukimo District.
The name of the airstrip has been named as Kenyem and Kenyam in Indonesian media. This is the same airstrip which is named Keneyan in the Australian Defence Force's Tactical Airfield Guide of the region.
Also on the same day, 9 September 2011, another Cessna 208B Grand Caravan (PK-BVQ) was mistakenly reported to have slid off the runway at Kupang's El Tari airport. The aircraft suffered a flat tyre during landing and was stuck on the runway. As ground personnel arrived at the aircraft, the decision was made to push the aircraft off the runway in order to reopen the runway. The pictures taken of the aircraft on the grass led to a story of a runway excursion.
This incident resulted in the aircraft blocking the runway for 50 minutes causing two Boeing 737 commercial flights to divert to Makassar, Sulawesi.
On 23 November 2011 a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan (PK-VVG) was destroyed after a go-around at Sugapa Airport in Nabire, Papua, killing the aircraft's co-pilot and leaving the pilot with severe injuries; the two crew were the only people on the aircraft, which was operating a cargo flight. The plane crash occurred after avoiding a runway jaywalker at a poorly managed runway in the Bintang Mountains in West Papua. The pilot decided to fly back up, but the area was surrounded by mountains and cliffs, causing the accident. The exact cause of the accident however will be determined after further investigation. The National Transport Safety Committee released final report on the accident in April 16, 2013.
On April 25, 2012 a PC 6 (PK VVQ) crashed in Kalimantan Timur, Melak district killing the pilot and passenger(s) which was engaged in Aerial Survey of the area. The aircraft was reported missing at 1710 LT on the 25th April with the wreckage found on the 26th April confirming the condition of the occupants/aircraft.
As a result of this safety record, United States Embassy personnel as of May 2012 are prohibited from flying on Susi Air.

GrADS

The Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) is an interactive desktop tool that is used for easy access, manipulation, and visualization of earth science data. The format of the data may be either binary, GRIB, NetCDF, or HDF-SDS (Scientific Data Sets). GrADS has been implemented worldwide on a variety of commonly used operating systems and is freely distributed over the Internet.
GrADS uses a 4-Dimensional data environment: longitude, latitude, vertical level, and time. Data sets are placed within the 4-D space by use of a data descriptor file. GrADS interprets station data as well as gridded data, and the grids may be regular, non-linearly spaced, Gaussian, or of variable resolution. Data from different data sets may be graphically overlaid, with correct spatial and time registration. It uses the "ctl" mechanism to join differing time group data sets. Operations are executed interactively by entering FORTRAN-like expressions at the command line. A rich set of built-in functions are provided, but users may also add their own functions as external routines written in any programming language.
Data may be displayed using a variety of graphical techniques: line and bar graphs, scatter plots, smoothed contours, shaded contours, streamlines, wind vectors, grid boxes, shaded grid boxes, and station model plots. Graphics may be output in PostScript or image formats. GrADS provides geophysically intuitive defaults, but the user has the option to control all aspects of graphics output.
GrADS has a programmable interface (scripting language) that allows for sophisticated analysis and display applications. Use scripts to display buttons and drop menus as well as graphics, and then take action based on user point-and-clicks. GrADS can be run in batch mode, and the scripting language facilitates using GrADS to do long overnight batch jobs.

Sperm sorting

Sperm sorting is a means of choosing what type of sperm cell is to fertilize the egg cell. It can be used to sort out sperm that are most healthy, as well as determination of more specific traits, such as sex selection in which spermatozoa are separated into X- (female) and Y- (male) chromosome bearing populations based on their difference in DNA content. The resultant 'sex-sorted' spermatozoa are then able to be used in conjunction with other assisted reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to produce offspring of the desired sex.
For general health.
DNA damage in sperm cells may be detected by using Raman spectroscopy. It is not specific enough to detect individual traits, however.
The sperm cells having least DNA damage may subsequently be injected into the egg cell by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
For sex selection.
Methods.
Sperm sorting utilizes the technique of flow cytometry to analyze and 'sort' spermatozoa. During the early to mid-1980s, Dr. Glenn Spaulding was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort "two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm" was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of haploid expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins. Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997. At the time of the patent filing, both Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the USDA were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei, after the Application Serial Number 35,986 patent filing a new technique was utilized by the USDA where "sperm were briefly sonicated to remove tails". USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, 'Beltsfield Sperm Sexing Technology' relies on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes. Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called Hoechst 33342 which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the "female" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart. As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa. As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge). The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.
Accuracy.
While highly accurate, sperm sorting by flow cytometry will not produce two completely separate populations. That is to say, there will always be some "male" sperm among the "female" sperm and vice versa. The exact percentage purity of each population is dependent on the species being sorted and the 'gates' which the operator places around the total population visible to the machine. In general, the larger the DNA difference between the X and Y chromosome of a species, the easier it is to produce a highly pure population. In sheep and cattle, purities for each sex will usually remain above 90% depending on 'gating', while for humans these may be reduced to 90% and 70% for "female" and "male" spermatozoa, respectively.
Ethical concerns.
Sperm sorting raises the ethical concerns implicit to the idea of sex selection. However, the fact that sperm sorting is in effect sex-preselection, with the sex of the offspring decided at conception rather than post-conception (preimplantation genetic diagnosis), post-implantation (ultrasound) or post-birth, makes the technique decidedly more attractive from an ethical standpoint.
Regulation.
In the US, for humans, the practice of sperm sorting is tightly regulated by the FDA. In effect, it remains an ongoing clinical trial, with the procedure made available to a limited number of participants each month, in addition to fulfilling certain criteria, such as having a disease with sex linkage or having at least one child (for family balancing).

Famadihana

Famadihana is a funerary tradition of the Malagasy people in Madagascar. Known as "the turning of the bones", people bring forth the bodies of their ancestors from the family crypts and rewrap them in fresh cloth, then dance with the corpses around the tomb to live music.
The Famadihana custom appears to be a custom of somewhat recent origin, perhaps only since the seventeenth century in its present form, although it may be an adaptation of premodern double funeral customs from Southeast Asia. The custom is based upon a belief that the spirits of the dead finally join the world of the ancestors after the body's complete decomposition and appropriate ceremonies, which may take many years. In Madagascar this became a regular ritual usually once every seven years, and the custom brings together extended families in celebrations of kinship. 
The practice of Famadihana is on the decline due to the expense of silk shrouds and opposition from some Christian organizations. Evangelical Protestants discourage the custom, although the Catholic Church no longer objects because it regards Famadihana as purely cultural rather than religious. As one Malagasy man explained to the BBC, "It's important because it's our way of respecting the dead. It is also a chance for the whole family, from across the country, to come together."

Khachmaz (city)

Khachmaz (also, Xaçmaz, Kekhna-Khachmaz, and Khachmas) is a city in the Khachmaz Rayon of Azerbaijan.
History.
Origin of the name.
Modern historians believe that the name Khachmaz derives from "khachmataki" tribe of Huns, which transformed into "Khacmaz" in the middle of 7th century. It is also interesting, that part of the tribe in the second middle of the 7th century migrated to the territory of the current Oghuz district having constructed the settlement and naming Khachmar fortress.
Economy.
The economy of Khachmaz is partially agricultural, partially tourist based, with some industries in operation.
Tourism.
Khachmaz is considered a popular tourist destination, especially due to the Nabran district. The combination of a very good summer climate, woods along the seashore and excellent golden beaches was exploited by the construction of large numbers of hotels and apartments in Nabran.
International relations.
Twin cities.
Khachmaz is twinned with the following cities:

ExtenZe

ExtenZe is a herbal nutritional supplement claiming to promote "natural male enhancement", which suggests a euphemism for penis enlargement. However, television commercials make few definitive claims, employing suggestion and euphemism or promising an "improved" or "arousing" sexual experience. Websites selling the product make several more detailed claims, including acquiring a "larger penis". Their enlarging effects are described as "temporary" which will only perceive you a "chubby one" while under the use of Extenze. Early infomercials featured a studio audience and porn star Ron Jeremy. Former Dallas Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson has also appeared in an ExtenZe commercial. NASCAR driver Kevin Conway is a current spokesman for ExtenZe.
Legal actions, criticisms, and controversy.
A class action settlement has been proposed and preliminarily approved, to resolve plaintiff claims that ExtenZe maker Biotab Nutraceuticals, Inc engaged in deceptive marketing (advertising, labeling, promotion, etc.) by claiming it enlarged a man's penis despite the lack of any credible scientific evidence supporting that claim.
Claimants can file claims for a full refund of documented purchases of ExtenZe, and a refund for up to $22.50 of undocumented purchases. The complaint also claims that the claims were made in violation of a pre-existing court-ordered injunction. , the settlement has been awaiting a ruling from the court on a motion for final approval for 6 months.
In 2006, ExtenZe agreed to pay the Orange County, California, district attorney's office $300,000 in civil penalties for unfair business practices and false advertising. Susan Kang Schroeder of the DA's office said the company could not back up its claim that the pills caused users' penises to grow 27%. After several customers in Laguna Beach, California complained to the Better Business Bureau that ExtenZe was making them sick, the district attorney investigated. Investigations revealed that ExtenZe’s lead content was beyond the legal limits.
Ira Sharlip, a spokesman for the American Urological Association, has said, "There is no such thing as a penis pill that works. These are all things that are sold for profit. There's no science or substance behind them." The manufacturer does not give an exact increase in length that one should expect to be grown after using the pills but it does however state that the results are temporary and that they are to be seen only as long as the supplement is administered. Although it has been marketed as a completely safe product, there have been side effects reported while using this product. Side effects from ExtenZe may include heart palpitations, migraines, dizzy spells, insomnia, anxiety and mood swings.
The ExtenZe side effects associated with the yohimbe extract include increased body temperature, increased blood pressure, sweating, increased heart rate, nausea, and upset stomach. Other side effects can include aggression, pounding heart, restlessness, fever, feeling like fainting, hallucinations, muscle twitches or spasms, abnormal behavior, severe headache, bruising easily, shortness of breath, blurred vision, seizures, ringing in the ears, chest pain, confusion, loss of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, insomnia, mild skin rash, nervousness, cold feeling in the feet or hands, tingling or numbness in the feet or hands, and difficulty staying asleep.
Individuals who are on prescription medication or who suffer from various medical conditions are recommended to consult a medical care provider before consuming ExtenZe. Also, if side effects are experienced, one is advised to interrupt taking the pills and visit a doctor.
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series teams Front Row Motorsports and Robby Gordon Motorsports have sued both Kevin Conway and ExtenZe for lack of payment. The original contract with FRM stipulated that Conway be placed in a top-35 car, and if Conway failed to qualify for two consecutive events or fell 300 points behind another rookie, the contract would be terminated. Conway's marketing firm, Exclaim, was also contractually obligated to pay the team in weekly installments. However, during the summer of 2010, Exclaim started to pay about $56,000, half of the intended $108,000. FRM is suing for $5.4 million. In Gordon's case, ExtenZe initially agreed to give him money in exchange for putting their logo on Gordon's car. However, when Conway was in danger of falling out of the top-35 in owners points, Gordon asked to drive the car with ExtenZe sponsorship and they initially agreed. However, ExtenZe refused to pay Gordon citing a breach of contract.
Sports and doping.
In 2010, 400-meter Olympic gold medalist LaShawn Merritt was banned from competition for taking ExtenZe, which contains dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a steroid that is banned in athletic competition. Merritt apologized, saying that he did not realize that the formulation contained DHEA. Merritt provisionally accepted a two-year ban from competition, although he announced plans to appeal. Sports authorities, however were not sympathetic:
"Any professional athlete in this sport knows that they are solely responsible for anything that goes into their bodies. For Mr. Merritt to claim inadvertent use of a banned substance due to the ingestion of over-the-counter supplements brings shame to himself and his teammates. Thanks to his selfish actions, he has done damage to our efforts to fight the plague of performance-enhancing drugs in our sport," USA Track and Field CEO Doug Logan said in a press release.
Late in 2011, however, his ban ended and he was cleared to compete in the 2012 Olympics[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/sports/olympics/sprinter-lashawn-merritt-leaves-humiliation-behind.html?pagewanted=3].

Brad Ascalon, born in 1977, is an American industrial designer who grew up in the Philadelphia suburb of Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He earned a bachelor's degree at Rutgers University, and received a Masters Degree in industrial design from New York's Pratt Institute. His early artistic and design influences included his grandfather, the Hungarian-born Art Deco sculptor and industrial designer Maurice Ascalon, as well as his father, the American sculptor and stained glass artist David Ascalon, founder of Ascalon Studios.
Ascalon started his eponymous studio in 2006, working in the areas of furniture, product and packaging design. Among his first clients was the cosmetics conglomerate L'Oreal. His first international recognition, however, came while he was still a graduate student, when the international design magazine Wallpaper* selected Ascalon as one of the year's top ten up-and-coming designers in the world. Since then, Ascalon's multi-disciplinary design studio has worked with clients around the world within a number of industries, most notably the furniture industry. Ascalon's furniture work has been exhibited globally, from Milan's Salone del Internazionale del Mobile, the world's largest stage for design, to Germany's IMM Cologne, Paris' Maison et Objet and NYC's International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF). Ascalon's first showing at the ICFF was in 2007 as part of the ICFF Bernhardt Design Studio Exhibition, a high-profile juried competition whose primary goal is to promote emerging designers around the world. In 2008, Ascalon became one of only two Americans ever to have designed for the French furniture powerhouse, Ligne Roset; in 2010, his work started being produced by "Bernhardt Design"; and in 2011 by "Design Within Reach".

Italian Damone

Italian Damone is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Italy. It is a unique draughts (checkers) variant. Instead of several undifferentiated pieces as found in most draughts games, Italian Damone has ranked pieces; moreover, there are only eight pieces. The pieces are ranked from high to low as Damone, Damas, and Pedine. The Damone is sometimes referred to as Imperatore. The standard game has 1 Damone, 2 Damas, and 5 Pedines for each player. A player's piece can only capture an enemy piece(s) if the enemy piece(s) are the same rank or lower. They cannot capture higher ranked pieces. Furthermore, the initial positions of the pieces are different from most draughts games, and the movements as well. Promotion to higher rank is also a feature in this game. 
The game belongs to the draughts family, and its closest relatives are Italian draughts and Dablot Prejjesne. All these games have the common feature that pieces can only capture enemy pieces of the same rank or lower. 
There are a few variants of Italian Damone. One variant starts off with 3 Damas and 3 Pedines with no Damones. Another variant requires only the capture of all Damones to win the game which makes the game more dynamic, and resembles Chess.
In Italian, Damone or Imperatore means "emperor", Dama means "king", and Pedine means "checker man". 
Goal.
In the standard game, the player who captures all their opponent's pieces is the winner. Alternatively, stalemating the enemy's pieces by not allowing them to move is a win for a player. 
In some other variants, it is enough only for a player to capture all their opponent's Damones to win the game.
Equipment.
A standard 8 x 8 draughts board is used. In the standard game, each player has 1 Damone, 2 Damas, and 5 Pedines. One plays the red pieces, and the other player plays the black pieces.
Another variant consist of 3 Damas and 3 Pedines, but no Damones. However, pieces can be promoted to higher ranks such as Damone.
Game Play and Rules.
1. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. 
2. Pieces are played only on the black diagonal squares of a standard draughts board. 
3. Each player plays from a corner of the board opposite from each other. Each player's pieces are set up on their corner of the board. Each player's Damone is at the corner black square. The 2 Damas are found on the next diagonal of black squares, and specifically at the squares that lie on the edges. The 5 Pedines are found on the next diagonal of black squares.
3. Players may either move one piece in a turn, or use one piece to capture enemy piece(s) in a turn. Players alternate their turns.
4. A Pedine moves and captures in three directions. Since the setup of the pieces are on opposite corners of the board, moving "forward" means moving diagonally toward the enemy's direction. For example, if a player starts from the lower right-hand corner of the board, then moving forward means moving in a northwest direction (towards the upper left corner of the board). Additionally Pedines may move "sideways" in two directions. In this example, the player can move their Pedine in a northeast direction (towards the upper right corner of the board), or in a southwest directions (towards the lower left corner of the board). Pedines can never move or capture "backwards" which in this case would be toward the southeast direction (lower right corner of the board). 
Damas and Damones can move and capture in all four directions. 
All pieces may move only one space diagonally onto a vacant black square on the board in a turn.
5. Pieces can only capture enemy pieces of the same rank or lower. The Damone is the highest ranked piece, and therefore can capture all types of pieces from the other player including the Damone. The Dama is the second highest ranked piece, and can capture only the other player's Damas and Pedines, and not the Damone. The Pedine is the lowest ranked piece, and can only capture the other player's Pedine, and not the Damas or Damones. 
6. A piece captures by the short leap as in most draughts games. The piece leaps over the adjacent enemy piece onto a vacant square on the other side. Captures are compulsory. Multiple captures are allowed, and must be taken. 
Players must choose the highest rank capturing line available to them.
Capturing lines are ranked as follows from highest to lowest preference:
Example #1: Two Damones (Damones A and Damones B) can capture in a player's turn.
Damone A can capture 2 Damones and 1 Pedine
Damone B can capture 1 Damone and 2 Damas
Both capturing lines have an equivalent number of pieces (3 pieces), and therefore rule (i) does not apply. Both capturing pieces are Damones, and therefore rule (ii) does not apply. Both capturing lines have a Damone as their highest ranked piece, and therefore rule (iii) does not apply. However, Damone A can capture 2 Damones, whereas, Damone B can only capture 1 Damone. By rule (iv), Damone's A capturing line must be taken. 
Example #2: One Damone has two capturing lines. 
Line A consist of 2 Damones and 1 Pedine
Line B consist of 1 Damone and 2 Damas
Both capturing lines have an equivalent number of pieces (3 pieces), and therefore rule (i) does not apply. There is only one capturing piece for both lines of capture, and therefore rule (ii) does not apply. Both capturing lines have a Damone as their highest ranked piece, and therefore rule (iii) does not apply. However, Lina A consist of 2 Damones, whereas, Line B consist only of 1 Damone. By rule (iv), Line A must be taken. 
Example #3: Two Damones (Damone A and Damone B) can capture in a player's turn. 
Damone A can capture 1 Damone and 2 Damas. 
Damone B can capture 1 Damone, 1 Dama, and 1 Pedine. 
Both have an equal number of pieces to be captured (3 pieces), and therefore rule (i) does not apply. Both capturing pieces are Damones, and therefore rule (ii) does not apply. The highest piece in both capturing lines is a Damone, and therefore rule (iii) does not apply. Each capturing line has the same number of Damones (only 1 each), and therefore rule (iv) does not apply. The next highest piece on both capturing line is a Dama, and therefore rule (v) does not apply. However, Damone A can capture 2 Damas, whereas, Damone B can only capture 1 Dama, therefore by rule (vi), the capturing line that must be taken is that of Damone A. 
Example #4: One Damas has two capturing lines.
Lina A consist of 1 Damas and 1 Pedine
Line B consist of 1 Damas and 1 Pedine
Both lines consist of an equal number of pieces (2 pieces each), and therefore rule (i) does not apply. There is only one capturing piece involved, and therefore rule (ii) does not apply. The highest piece in both capturing lines is a Damas, and therefore rule (iii) does not apply. Each capturing line has the same number of Damas (only 1 each), and therefore rule (iv) does not apply. The next highest piece on both capturing line is a Pedine, and therefore rule (v) does not apply. Each capturing line has the same number of Pedines (only 1 each), and therefore rule (vi) does not apply. A decision cannot be made yet based on the first six rules, and therefore, rule (vii) applies, and the player is free to choose either Line A or Line B to capture. 
7. A Pedine is promoted to Dama when it lands on the two squares originally occupied by the other player's Damas. A Dama is promoted to Damone when it lands on the square originally occupied by the other player's Damone.

Universal queue

Universal queue or UQ is a relatively advanced concept in contact center design whereby multiple communications channels (such as telephone, fax and email) are integrated into a single 'universal queue' to standardize processing and handling.
Benefits.
The immediate benefits of UQ include standardised routing, recording, handling, reporting, and management of all communications in a contact center (or across an entire organisation).
The immediate benefits may in turn result in others, such as increased sales, reduced overheads, cost savings and an improvement in relationships with customers and suppliers.
Usage.
Although UQ was discussed at least as far back as 2004, the difficulties in implementing such a system seem to have prevented its widespread uptake. As of 2008, there is little data available online regarding existing UQ implementations.

Tom Hardy (designer)

Tom Hardy (born 1946) is an American design strategist and former corporate head of the IBM Design Program. 
Education.
Tom Hardy was educated in industrial design at Auburn University (1964–1970) under Eva Pfeil (German) and Walter Schaer (Swiss), former students at the Ulm School of Design in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953-1968). Pfeil and Schaer established their curriculum at Auburn in 1961 based on the ′Ulm Model′ and their experiences under Max Bill (Swiss), co-founder of HfG and pupil at the Bauhaus (1919–1933) and Tomás Maldonado (Argentinian), HfG Rector and advocate of systems-thinking. Pfeil had also worked in Bill's studio where she collaborated on the classic 1957 Junghans wall clock.A major influence on the Auburn curriculum established by Pfeil and Schaer was the seminal teaching of Horst Rittel, HfG professor (1958-1963), whose courses included design methods, cybernetics, operational analysis and communication theory.
Hardy's graduate studies at Georgia Institute of Technology's School of History, Technology, & Society (1995-96) focused on broad socio-historical perspectives as sources of analysis emphasizing both change over time and cultural comparisons.
IBM Design Program and ThinkPad.
As corporate head of the IBM Design Program, Hardy directed worldwide identity operations in concert with distinguished designers Paul Rand and Richard Sapper He played a key role in development of the first IBM ThinkPad notebook computer (1992) together with a new differentiated product personality strategy which focused on providing more unique character to help revitalize IBM's brand image in the 1990s. 
Early in his career, Hardy was the industrial designer of numerous award-winning IBM products, including the original IBM Personal Computer introduced in 1981.During the 1970s, he also designed advanced industrial design concepts for 'single user computers' during the infancy of personal computing. His work included a design model in 1973 to complement the IBM engineering prototype of SCAMP, dubbed by "PC World" as "the world's first portable computer". Some of these early concepts by Hardy are highlighted in the book "DELETE: A Design History of Computer Vapourware".
Other Influences.
During the course of his 22 years at IBM, Hardy crossed paths with Eliot Noyes, Edward Tufte, Ivan Chermayeff, Saul Bass, Henry Wolf, George Nelson and Niels Diffrient. Interaction with these prominent designers, in addition to Rand and Sapper, would cultivate his design perspective. Likewise, Hardy's insight into the symbolic structure of popular culture would be broadened by time spent in London with renowned artist Sir Eduardo Paolozzi who was a major influence in the Pop Art movement.
Design strategist.
Later an independent consultant, Hardy created Verbal-Visual Framework (VVF); a brand-design management tool which combines qualitative and quantitative research with semiotics and predictive analytics. VVF delivers insights as to how brand intent resonates emotionally with consumers through design in a cultural context. Hardy's work includes Samsung Electronics where his comprehensive integration of brand intent and design strategy into the corporate infrastructure is cited for elevating the company's global image.
Educator.
Hardy serves as Adjunct Professor of Design Management at Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD).

Crank Caverns

Crank Caverns is the common name of the remains of the Rainford Delph Quarry near Crank in Merseyside. It is a network of underground tunnels and caverns, as well as an extensive woodland. Information in the St. Helens local history archives states that quarrying for stone began here as early as 1730. As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method. Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out. This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today. Mining ceased in 1865, and the woods and caverns were used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until 1939, when they became a storage facility for ammunition for the anti-aircraft position at Crank. After the war, the caverns ceased use as a game reserve.
Caverns.
The mines are an example of pillar and stall mining, with the roof having support provided by pillars of stone left in place when mining was taking place. There are two sets of caverns, the first and most noticeable caves have seven portals and lead down into a large cavern. To the back and to the left of this was a roadway which was sealed in 1948. Beyond the roadway is an extensive network of tunnels, with access being possible from secure location. The other set of caves lies north west of the first set. These caves lie at the bottom of a deep ditch. One is simply a short tunnel, the other leads into a deeper set of caves. The entrance to the deeper set of caves is gated.
Myths and legends.
There are numerous myths and legends associated with the caverns. The most well known is that during the Reformation local Catholics being persecuted by King Henry VIII (1491–1547) took shelter in the caverns and conducted secret mass there, but mining on the quarry only began in about 1730. Some stories report the caves running to, amongst other places, Up Holland in Wigan, Lowe House Church in St. Helens and Moss Bank in St. Helens, another stated that there was in fact a tunnel running some seven miles from St. Helens Town Hall to Crank Caverns in order to conduct 'secret' hangings.
"Vicious dwarves" were once rumoured to inhabit a labyrinth of caverns in Crank. In the late 18th century four children decided to explore the sandstone caverns and vanished. One child survived and told a terrifying tale about small old men with beards who killed his three friends and chased him. The petrified child stumbled over human bones in the caves and finally managed to scramble through an opening to the surface as a hand was grabbing at his ankle. The authorities were concerned because a number of people had gone missing in the area near the cave entrances. Two heavily armed soldiers descended into the caverns with torches and claimed that they not only found a heap of human bones, they also found the ruins of an ancient church of some unknown denomination. The interior of the church was lit by three large candles and grotesque gargoyles formed part of an altar. Throughout the exploration of the underground, the soldiers said they felt as if they were being watched, and also heard voices speaking in an unknown language. One report said that a child's head was found in a cave, along with evidence of cannibalism. After a second investigation, the caves either collapsed or gunpowder was used to seal them.

Arthur Clery

Arthur Edward Clery (1879–1932) was an Irish politician and university professor.
Early life and education.
His father, Art Ua Cléirigh, was a barrister practising in India who published books on early Irish history. Clery was brought up to a considerable extent by a relative, Charles Dawson. A cousin, William Dawson (who used the pen-name "Avis"), became his closest friend and associate. Clery was educated at the Catholic University School on Leeson Street (where he acquired the confirmation name "Chanel" in honour of the Marist martyr Peter Chanel, which he often used as a pseudonym), at Clongowes Wood College, and University College in Stephen's Green. He was a university contemporary of James Joyce. 
Professional life.
Clery's principal themes included the difficulties of Roman Catholic graduates seeking professional employment, dramatic criticism (he hailed Lady Gregory's play "Kincora" as the Abbey Theatre's first masterpiece but was repulsed by the works of Synge), Catholic-Protestant rivalry, tension within the Dublin professional class, and the vagaries of the Gaelic revival movement (including Clery's own attempts to learn Irish in Ballingeary, and such questions as whether a true Gael should play tennis). 
Clery advocated partition on the basis of a two-nation theory, first advanced in 1904–05 (possibly in response to William O'Brien's advocacy of securing Home Rule through compromise with moderate Unionists). Several of his articles on the subject were reprinted in his 1907 essay collection, "The Idea of a Nation". Clery derived this unusual view for a nationalist from several motives, including a belief that arguments for Irish nationalists' right to self-determination could be used to justify Ulster Unionists' right to secede from Ireland, fear that it might be impossible to obtain Home Rule unless Ulster were excluded, and distaste for both Ulster Protestants and Ulster Catholics, whom he saw as deplorably anglicised. He remained a partitionist for the rest of his life. Clery was not particularly successful as a barrister, but on the establishment of University College Dublin (UCD) in 1909 he was appointed to the part-time post of Professor of the Law of Property. 
After 1914 he moved from unenthusiastic support for John Redmond's Irish Parliamentary Party to separatism. Before the 1916 Easter Rising he was an inactive member of the Irish Volunteers, and was defence counsel at the court-martial of Eoin MacNeill. During the 1918 general election he campaigned for Sinn Féin. As one of the few barristers prepared to assist the Sinn Féin Court system he was appointed to the Dáil Supreme Court. Clery opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty because he believed it would lead to re-Anglicisation and the eventual return of the Union. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as an abstentionist independent Teachta Dála (TD) for the National University of Ireland constituency at the June 1927 general election. 
He did not take his seat and he did not contest the September 1927 general election since new legislation obliged candidates to pledge in advance that they would take their seat. Clery spent his last years in solitude, having never married. He was one of the lawyers who advised Éamon de Valera that the Irish Free State was not legally obliged to pay the Land Annuities which had been agreed in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922.
Personal life.
Clery was a close friend of Tom Kettle (who died serving on active duty in Europe during World War I), with whom he founded a dining club, the "Cui Bono". Hugh Kennedy (later Chief Justice of the Irish Free State) was also a lifelong friend. The principal influence on Clery was the "Irish Ireland" editor D. P. Moran, to whose weekly paper, "The Leader" Clery became a frequent contributor. (Clery also wrote as "Chanel" for the University College paper at St. Stephen's, and as "Arthur Synan" for the "New Ireland Review".)
Death.
Clery died in November 1932 from pneumonia contracted at a public meeting. In addition to The Idea of a nation, Clery published "Dublin Essays" (1920) and (as Arthur Synan) The Shadows of the King, a historical novel modeled on Thackeray's "Esmonde".

David Bodian

David Bodian ( 15 May 1910 – 18 September 1992) was an American medical scientist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who worked in polio research. In the early 1940s he helped lay the groundwork for the eventual development of polio vaccines by combining neurological research with the study of the pathogenesis of polio. With his understanding of the disease, he made a series of crucial discoveries that paved the way for the final development of a vaccine by Jonas Salk and later by Albert Sabin.
Biography.
David Bodian was born in St. Louis to Jewish parents who had recently immigrated from the Ukraine. He grew up in Chicago, where he attended public school. In 1929 Bodian took up the study of science at the University of Chicago, where he received a bachelor of science degree in zoology in 1931, his Ph.D. in anatomy in 1934 and his M.D. in 1937. After spending some months at the University of Michigan as a National Research Council Fellow, he came to Johns Hopkins University in 1939 as a research fellow in anatomy. This was the beginning of a long-standing partnership with Howard Howe, although in 1941 Bodian served an interim period of a few months as an assistant professor of anatomy at the Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. When the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis awarded funding to the Department of Epidemiology at the Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health to support research on polio, Bodian returned to Hopkins, and he and Howe joined the School of Hygiene to continue their research.
Bodian advanced from assistant professor in epidemiology to associate professor in 1946, and became Professor of Anatomy and director of the department in 1957. When he accepted the position of professor emeritus of anatomy and neurobiology in the Department of Laryngology and Otology in 1977, he ran an electron microscopy laboratory. In his later work, Bodian studied the spiral structure within the cochlea known as the Organ of Corti.
David Bodian married Elinor Widmont, a medical illustrator and painter who contributed illustrations to some of Bodian’s published articles, in 1944. They had five children. Bodian died of Parkinson's disease in September 1992.
Pioneer work on polio vaccines.
Over the next twenty years, the Hopkins team made a series of discoveries, several of which were crucial for the development of a vaccine against polio. In 1946 Isabel Morgan joined the team and together they found out that there were three basic immunological types of poliovirus, explaining the phenomenon of second infections and the fact that artificial immunity to only one strain would not protect against infection with one of the others. Their publication on the “Differentiation of Types of Poliomyelitis Viruses,” in the "American Journal of Hygiene" in 1949 became a milestone in the development of new polio vaccine methods.
The contributions of Bodian, Morgan, and Howe thus laid the scientific groundwork for the subsequent development of the Salk and Sabin polio vaccines. In Bodian's own summary their accomplishments were:
Honors and awards.
In 1941 Bodian received the E. Mead Johnson Award in Pediatrics from the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 1958, he was inducted along with his colleagues Howe and Morgan and twelve other polio experts into the Polio Hall of Fame at the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1958, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 19XX and the American Philosophical Society in 1973. In 1985, the Society honored him with the Karl Spencer Lashley Award. Bodian was an honorary member of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, the French Neurological Society, and the Mexican Society of Anatomy, and he served as president of the American Association of Anatomists from 1971 to 1972. 
In 1980, the Johns Hopkins University dedicated the Bodian Room in recognition of his contributions to polio research. He received an honorary doctorate from the university in 1987, and the year before his death, in the spring of 1991, the School of Hygiene and Public Health named him one of seventy-five “Heroes of Public Health.”

Laylat al Bara'at

Laylat al Baraat (Arabic: ليلة البراءة, where "البراءة" can be translated to acquittal/absolution) is a Muslim event celebrated on the 14th night of the month of Sha'aban, the eighth month of the Islamic calendar.
Description.
The night of mid-Sha'aban is known as "Laylatul Bara’ah" or "Laylatun Nisfe min Sha’ban" in the Arab world, and as "Shab-e-barat" (شب برات) in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Afghanistan and Nepal. These names are translated as 'the night of records', 'the night of assignment' and 'the night of deliverance'. The observance involves a festive nightlong vigil with prayers; in some regions, this is also a night when one's deceased ancestors are commemorated.
Origins.
Sunnis observe Mid-Sha'ban as a night of worship and salvation. Various hadiths have been in this regard, some weak and others graded hassan or sahih. Scholars including Imam Shafii, Imam Nawawi, Imam Ghazzali and Imam Suyuti have declared praying on the night of mid shaban as acceptable.
In his Majmu`, Imam Nawawi quoted Imam al-Shafi`i's Kitab al-Umm that there are 5 nights when dua (prayer) is answered, one of them being the night of the 15th of Sha`ban.
The hadith by Imam Ibn Hajr Haythmi, states:Narrated by Muadh bin Jabal (RA) from Prophet (salallahu alaihi wasalam) who said: Allah turns towards his creation in the Night of Mid-Shabaan and He forgives all of them except for a Mushrik and one who hates other people Zawaid #12860. Classed as Sahih by Salafi scholar Nasiruddin Albani in his silsilah Al-Sahihah.
Another hadith in Musnad Ahmed hanbal "Allah looks at His creation during the night of the 15th of Sha'ban and He forgives His servants except two- one intent on hatred (mushanin) and a murderer (qatilu nafs). Classed Hassan by Albani in his silsilah Al-Sahihah.
Hadith classed sahih by Ibn Hibban "Allah looks at His creation in the night of mid-Sha`ban and He forgives all His creation except for a mushrik (idolater) or a mushahin (one bent on hatred)." Ibn Hibban 7/470. Also reported by Tabrani muajamul Kabir 20/108-9 and Al Bayhaqi Iman 2/288
‘Aisha is reported to have said that Muhammad said,“This is the middle night of Sha’ban. Allah frees in it a large number of the people from the Hellfire, more than the number of the hair growing on the sheep of the tribe, Kalb. But He(swt) does not even look at a person who associates partners with Allah, or at a person who nourishes malice in his heart (against another muslim), or at a person who cuts off the ties of womb-relations, or at a man who leaves his clothes extending beyond his ankles (as a sign of pride), or at a person who disobeys his parents, or at a person who has a habit of drinking wine.” At-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb
Customs in different countries.
This occasion is celebrated with great reverence, pomp and gaiety all over South Asia, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Central Asia including Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kirghistan.
In Iran and Azerbaijan the festival is celebrated differently. In Shia Islam the day is celebrated as the birth date of Imam Al Mahdi, the twelfth Imam.
In the Arab world the festival is celebrated with enthusiasm by Shias and Arabs with Sufi heritage. The Salafi Arabs do not celebrate this holiday.
Sunni Muslims in Iraqi Kurdistan and Afghanistan celebrate this holiday 15 days before Ramadan. In Iraq, people give children candies as they walk around their neighborhoods.
Some Muslims in Indonesia do communal zikr in mosques followed by a lecture (ceramah) lead by an ustadz or otherwise known in Java and Madura as a kyai. This tradition is rarely followed in Indonesia, but it is widely followed in Aceh, West Sumatra and South Kalimantan.
Significance and traditions.
According to Muslim tradition, this night is called "Shab-e-Baraat" ("the night of freedom") because Allah frees His sinful servants who were destined for "Jahannam" (the Muslim notion of Hell). A person's life in the coming year, his sustenance, and whether or not they will have the opportunity to perform Hajj (pilgrimage) shall be decided on this night. The names of the souls of all those who are born and of all those who are to depart from this world are determined. One's actions are raised and sustenance sent down.

An Ounce of Pink

An Ounce of Pink is the 12th cartoon produced in the "Pink Panther" series. A total of 124 6-minute cartoons were produced between 1964 and 1980.
Plot.
The Pink Panther encounters a coin-operated talking weight and fortune machine which suggests that he bring it home with him on the basis of it being a valuable asset, able to provide weather forecasts and sports scores and predict the future whenever the panther so-desires. The Pink Panther assents to the machine's proposal, but whenever the machine is on the verge of disclosing expected important information, it goes silent, requiring the panther to insert a dime in the machine's coin slot. In addition, information dispersed is not helpful in improving the panther's condition as a safe falls on him after the machine foresees a fortune "com(ing his) way". "Back payment from a rear" is a painful impact onto him from behind by a speeding car, and the panther refuses to believe the machine's statement that his future is "in the bag", the result being instant wealth for a man who picks up from a street a sack of money that the Panther would have owned had he heeded the machine's prescience. A woman who gets insulted be the machine when she uses it tries to sic her dog on the machine, but the dog's basic instincts cause it to attack the Pink Panther instead.
Eventually, the rope with which the Pink Panther pulls the machine up a hill breaks, and the machine rolls down the hill and off of a city pier. The Pink Panther, knowing no good will come of this, declines to save it from drowning, instead dropping an anvil onto it to hasten its submergence into the water. As it sinks, it tells him he will need it sometime. The panther refuses to believe him, but is proven true when he is hit by a bus.
Production notes.
Portions of the music score were later utilized in "G.I. Pink", "Congratulations It's Pink" and "Prefabricated Pink".

Lincoln Center (Oregon)

Lincoln Center is a multi-building office complex in Tigard, Oregon, United States. Opened in 1981, the six-building complex was built over a decade and includes the 12-story Lincoln Tower, the tallest building in Washington County. Located on S.W. Greenburg Road at Oregon Route 217, Lincoln Center is adjacent to the Washington Square shopping mall in the Portland metropolitan area.
History.
Developed by the Trammell Crow Company beginning in 1980, the first building at Lincoln Center was completed in 1981. Additional buildings were completed in 1985, 1988, and 1989. The complex was annexed by Tigard in 1986 after a state commission decided in their favor over Beaverton and Portland. In 1990, Trammell Crow sold the property to the Japanese firm Seiyu International Corporation, headed by Yashimitsu Misawa, for $120 million.
Misawa was assisted in the transaction by state representative and former Tigard mayor Tom Brian, who received a $2 million commission for the sale. Brian faced formal ethics violations for his role and for accepting campaign contributions from the company and Misawa by the state, as well as charges by the Oregon Real Estate Agency for operating without a license, and a lawsuit by Misawa for an inflated sale price. He settled the lawsuit with Misawa and repaid part of the $2 million commission while Misawa was later arrested in Japan for various fraud charges concerning this and other real estate transactions. The ethics charges against Brian were latter dismissed.
In December 1991, Seiyu Corporation sold the complex to Sanyo Finance Company Ltd. for $102.7 million. Geese made news in 1991 and 1992 after nesting on the balcony of one of the towers. In 1995, SF Oregon Company (a subsidiary of Sanyo Finance Co. Ltd.) put the property up for sale with a listed price of $100 million. In 1996, Knickerbocker Properties (owned by the New York State Teachers Retirement System) purchased Lincoln Center for $89.4 million.
Knickerbocker placed the complex on sale in 2000, with Spieker Properties Inc. buying the center for $118 million in July 2000. Spieker merged with Equity Office Properties and adopted the Equity name in March 2001. The building was used in an earthquake response drill by county groups in April 2003. Equity Office Properties sold Lincoln Center in 2007 to Shorenstein Properties.
Details.
Completed in 1981, 1 Lincoln Center is five stories tall. 2 Lincoln Center and 3 Lincoln Center are six stories tall and were built in 1985. The newest building, 5 Lincoln Center, was finished in 1989 and is seven stories tall. Located in the Portland metropolitan area, the complex is in the city of Tigard, but uses a Portland mailing address. Lincoln Center is at S.W. Greenburg Road and Oregon Route 217 across from the Washington Square shopping mall. The six-building complex sits on acres and contains of leasable space, primarily office space with some retail space as well. The grounds of the center include a duck pond. Exteriors of the office buildings are faced with steel and red bricks. In addition to office buildings, the center includes parking garages.
Lincoln Tower.
Finished in 1988, Lincoln Tower or Lincoln Center Tower stands 12 stories tall. Built at a cost of $14 million, it measures in height. The skyscraper was built on and is the tallest building in Washington County. As the tallest, Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue use the building for training in fighting fires in high-rise buildings. Lincoln Tower includes a helicopter landing pad on the roof of the building.

Codd's theorem

Codd's theorem states that relational algebra and the domain-independent relational calculus queries, two well-known foundational query languages for the relational model, are precisely equivalent in expressive power. That is, a database query can be formulated in one language if and only if it can be expressed in the other.
The theorem is named after Edgar F. Codd, the father of the relational model for database management.
The domain independent relational calculus queries are precisely those relational calculus queries that are invariant under choosing domains of values beyond those appearing in the database itself. That is, queries that may return different results for different domains are excluded. An example of such a forbidden query is the query "select all tuples other than those occurring in relation R", where R is a relation in the database. Assuming different domains, i.e., sets of atomic data items from which tuples can be constructed, this query returns different results and thus is clearly not domain independent.
Codd's Theorem is notable since it establishes the equivalence of two syntactically quite dissimilar languages: relational algebra is an imperative, variable-free language, while relational calculus is a logical language with variables and quantification.
Relational calculus is essentially equivalent to first-order logic, and indeed, Codd's Theorem had been known to logicians since the late 1940s.
Query languages that are equivalent in expressive power to relational algebra were called relationally complete by Codd. By Codd's Theorem, this includes relational calculus. Relational completeness clearly does not imply that any interesting database query can be expressed in relationally complete languages. Well-known examples of inexpressible queries include simple aggregations (counting tuples, or summing up values occurring in tuples, which are operations expressible in SQL but not in relational algebra) and computing the transitive closure of a graph given by its binary edge relation (see also expressive power). Codd's theorem also doesn't consider SQL nulls and the three-valued logic they entail; the logical treatment of nulls remains mired in controversy. (For recent work extending Codd's theorem in this direction see the 2012 paper of Franconi and Tessaris.) Additionally, SQL allows duplicate rows (has multiset semantics.) Nevertheless, relational completeness constitutes an important yardstick by which the expressive power of query languages can be compared.

<doc id="18900636" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18900636" title="Garin Torani">
Garin Torani

Garin Torani literally means “a seed that is Torah oriented”. The phrase is used today, in Israel, to refer to a group of idealistic, religious zionist individuals and families who try to effect social and religious development in underdeveloped communities. Their mission is to strengthen and enrich floundering Israeli communities so that they can integrate into Israeli society as a whole.
The word "garin" (Hebrew for seed) sums up, in a word, the way a Garin Torani functions. Garinim Toraniim, as a group, employ a unique method of social outreach. They identify a need for growth in a community. And they don’t rely solely on social programming and funding–they bring people to neighborhoods in need. People with a vision for a flourishing community, people who are successful, idealistic, giving individuals, who can stand in as the seeds for communal growth.
History.
The original Garinim Toraniim began in development towns in Israel. As early as 1968, a garin was established in Kiryat Shmoneh, and later in Ma'alot-Tarshiha, Eilat, Yerucham and Tzfat. In recent years, garinim were established in larger cities as well (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv), in inner-city neighborhoods.
The idea of the Garin spread rapidly in the 1990s. At that point, the idea of building up the people and hearts of Israel, and not only the physical landmarks, took hold as part of the Religious Zionist vision. Rav Yoel Ben Nun, a leader of this new movement, expressed the idea that it is possible, and worthwhile, to settle in people’s hearts as well as in the land.
Mission.
While differing models of garinim exist, the main mission of any group that calls itself a garin torani is to effect social change in a neglected community using role models, enthusiasm and Jewish values. The goal is to increase stability and social integration, as well as productivity and connection to Torah in Israel’s communities. Starting from the ground up, promoters of the garin method, hope to move Israel on its way to being a stable, productive, flourishing nation with Torah and Jewish values at its core.
Garin Structure.
A Garin is always founded on a group of individuals who make their home in the community they seek to impact. The nature of this group differs from Garin to Garin. In the most successful models, where the social outreach extends into the daily lives of the community, the group is simply a group. They move into a neighborhood, they talk to people, they forge relationships with veteran community members. They found programs, and even institutions, that will benefit the members of the community.
Shaalei Torah initiated a new program in 2007 to develop the role of a communal rabbi in the garin communities. While Rabbis and synagogues are in abundance in Israel, members of traditional (masorati) communities often have no connection to a community rabbi. Shaalei Torah’s goal is to introduce rabbis into traditional communities who will take an active role in the community and build personal relationships with its members.
Some garinim are focused around a central yeshiva or kollel. That kollel provides a religious base for the garin members as well as the opportunity to use Torah as a means to improve the lives of their neighbors. While some of the kollel models have come under fire for remaining close knit and failing to integrate directly into the community, some garinim view their kollel as only one aspect of their work and place a strong, if not stronger emphasis on social outreach.
Garin Programs and Institutions.
Often, garinim establish religious Zionist schools and youth groups in the community. Many of the Shaalei Torah Garinim also reach out to families in need and children at risk through the establishment of a Bayit Cham, or Warm Home which provides services for children at risk during after school and summer hours. Most garinim also distribute food packages before the holidays, delivered personally by neighbors or garin members with the effect of reaching out both financially and socially.
In addition to the promotion of social development and integration, Garinim Toraniim also seek to infuse an understanding of Torah and Jewish values into communities that often have limited exposure to positive religious experience. The garin often establishes Torah classes, events and educational programs to celebrate and commemorate holidays and important dates in the Jewish calendar.
Organizations.
As the idea of Garinim Toraniim spread, more Garinim were established throughout the country. Organizations such as Shaalei Torah and Keren Moreshet were founded to establish and support these new garinim.
Shaalei Torah was the first organization to realize the need for a unified body to connect garinim. The organization began as a small garin in Beit Shemesh in the 1980s. After successfully establishing the Beit Shemesh Garin and effecting significant social improvements, it expanded its scope to provide support for the establishment of new Garinim. It provides a venue in which established garinim can share their experience with newer ones. Shaalei Torah has helped to establish a network of Garinim and offers them guidance and funding. In some of those garinim, it plays a continuing role, and in some a founding role until the new garin can function independently.

Kittatinny Formation

The Ordovician Kittatinny Formation or Kittatinny Limestone is a dolomitic limestone formation in New Jersey. The Kittatinny Limestones are located primarily within the long valley running from Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway Township, southwest toward Chester Township. It overlies the Cambrian Hardyston Quartzite.
The Kittatinny is now usually considered a Supergroup, rather than a Formation, as it includes several other Groups and Formations. Drake and Lyttle made this revision in 1980. The Supergroup includes the Leithsville Formation, Allentown Dolomite, and Beekmantown Group (which in turn includes the Stonehenge Limestone, Rickenbach Dolomite, Epler Formation, and Ontelaunee Formation). Richard Dalton wrote a more recent review of the stratigraphy of the Kittatinny.
The Kittatinny Limestone in New Jersey locally contains hydrocarbons and numerous accessory minerals including fluorite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, galena, quartz, albite, and others. The Kittatiny is an exception to the general rule that Paleozoic rocks in this area are generally poor aquifers, since wells drilled into it produce relatively large flows of water.

Liam Phillips

Liam Peter Phillips (born 11 March 1989) is a BMX racing cyclist respresenting Great Britain. In 2013 he won the UCI BMX World Championships, his first.
Having been cycling from the age of 5, he took up competitive BMX whilst a junior and won ten consecutive British titles. He won his first European title in 1999, and represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics and again in 2012 despite having broken his collarbone shortly prior.
Early life.
Born at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, he was raised in Burnham-on-Sea and attended the The King Alfred School. He began cycling at five years old, and often raced his sister. Both of his parents were involved in BMX with his father being a former national coach, and helped to found the local BMX club in Burnham.
Cycling career.
Between the ages of five and fourteen, he was the winner of ten consecutive British BMX titles. In 1999 he won the European BMX Championship for the first time, and joined the Olympic Academy Programme in 2005. In 2008 he was selected for the British team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China as a competitor in the men's BMX. It was the first time the sport had been featured in an Olympic Games as an official sport; Phillips placed seventh in the second heat and was eliminated from the competition.
He was injured at the 2010 UCI BMX World Championships in South Africa, damaging his shoulder during the second moto. In early 2011 he began training with the British track cycling team, eventually being considered as one of the members of the squad's men's sprint team. He decided to make the switch from BMX due to the reduced chance of injury in track racing. During this period he was a member of the sprint team that placed third at the British National Team Sprint Championships in September 2011. However, it was announced in October 2011 that he had decided to return to BMX, which resulted in the media considering him to be one of the best prospects to represent Great Britain in the men's BMX at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.
Having taken the silver medal in the time trial at the 2012 UCI BMX World Championships held at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, the following day Philips broke his collarbone during the morning's Moto 1 race. This resulted in him requiring surgery to insert a metal plate, and put his selection for the 2012 Games in doubt. However, he was chosen for the British team despite the injury and was still aiming for a win at the Olympics, saying "The goal is gold, without a doubt. I'm training not to be a medal winner but to be Olympic champion."
Personal life.
He lives in Manchester, close to the National Indoor BMX Arena. He likes to play golf in his spare time.

Jewel Robbery

Jewel Robbery is a 1932 American comedy-mystery film, directed by William Dieterle and starring William Powell and Kay Francis. It is based on the 1931 Hungarian play "Ekszerrablás a Váci-uccában" by Ladislas Fodor, and its subsequent English adaptation, "Jewel Robbery" by Bertram Bloch.
Plot.
In Vienna, Baroness Teri von Horhenfels (Kay Francis) relieves the boredom of her marriage to her rich but dull husband (Henry Kolker) with love affairs. One day, at an exclusive jewel shop to purchase a diamond ring, her tedium is lifted by a suave, charming thief (William Powell) and his gang. In turn, he is entranced by her beauty. He locks her husband and her latest lover, Paul (Hardie Albright) (of whom she has already tired), in the vault, and forces shop owner Hollander (Lee Kohlmar) to smoke a special cigarette that soon makes him forget his troubles. She however persuades him into leaving her free. However, he is not so carried away as to neglect his duties; he takes her ring, all of it.
Teri returns home, to be envied her adventure by her friend Marianne (Helen Vinson). They are frightened to discover that an intruder has broken in and opened her safe. However, they become puzzled and relieved when they find that not only is nothing missing, but the ring has been returned. Marianne departs hastily, anxious to avoid becoming entangled in a scandal. The thief then appears; Teri tries to return the ring, since keeping it would raise uncomfortable questions. When he refuses to take it back, she accuses him of using her to hide out from the police. Then, Detective Fritz (Alan Mowbray) arrives, flushes out the robber, and takes the two into custody.
However, all is not as it seems. It turns out that Fritz is a member of the gang. The thief had used the fake arrest to transport Teri to his house without protest for a night of romance. She is intrigued. Vienna has become too dangerous for him, so he asks her to meet him in Nice, but she hesitates. Just then, the real police surround the place. He and his gang escape, leaving Teri tied up so as to divert suspicion. After she is "rescued", she decides she needs a vacation away from Vienna to recover from the excitement... in Nice.
Production.
The pairing of William Powell and Kay Francis was the fifth of their seven films. Powell, who had recently married Carole Lombard, did not want to do the film initially, but gave in because he saw the role as an amusing one.
Response.
The "New York Times" review was lukewarm, calling the film a "nervous, brittle comedy", placing the blame on Kay Francis ("her performance is one in which her usual intelligence and sincerity are strangely absent").

White Roding Windmill

White Roding Windmill is a grade II listed Tower mill at White Roding, Essex, England which has been preserved.
History.
"White Roding Windmill" was built in 1877, replacing a post mill which had stood on the site since 1609. The post mill was destroyed on 1 January 1877 when the main post broke in a gale as the miller had too much cloth spread on the Common sails. A new tower mill was built by Whitmore's the Wickham Market, Suffolk millwrights to replace the post mill. The mill worked by wind until 1926, and then by engine until 1931. The lease on the mill expired that year and was not renewed. In 1937, the mill was purchased by the actor Michael Redgrave, passing to a company in Barrow-in-Furness in 1946. During the 1950s, the mill was derelict and threatened with demolition on more than one occasion. In the 1970s, millwrights Philip Barrett-Lennard and Vincent Pargeter built a new cap for the mill.
Description.
"White Roding windmill" is a five storey brick tower mill which had an ogee cap winded by a six bladed Fantail. It had four Patent sails carried on a cast iron windshaft. The only remaining piece of machinery is the Brake Wheel, which is diameter with 115 cogs. All other machinery was removed shortly after the Second World War.
The tower is high, diameter at the base and diameter at the curb. The walls are thick at the base. The mill is to the top of the cap. The mill drove two pairs of underdrift millstones.
