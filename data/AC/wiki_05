Don Catlin

Don H. Catlin (born June 4, 1938) is an anti-doping scientist and one of the founders of modern drug-testing in sport.
Career.
Catlin has overseen testing for performance-enhancing drugs at the three most recent Olympics held in the United States since the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, as well as testing for the United States Olympic Committee, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Major League Baseball’s minor leagues and the National Football League (NFL). He has also developed drug identification techniques currently in use at the Olympic, professional and collegiate levels.
In 1982, Catlin founded the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, the first anti-doping lab in the United States and now the world's largest testing facility of performance-enhancing drugs. He remained the lab's director for 25 years.
Catlin currently serves as president and CEO of the Los Angeles-based NGO Anti-Doping Research, Inc. (ADR).

It also advocates for and establishes programs to encourage athletes at all levels not to use performance-enhancing drugs.
In addition, he heads the companies Anti-Doping Sciences Institute (ADSI) and Banned Substances Control Group (BSCG).
In a peer-reviewed article in the August 2009 issue of the quarterly scientific journal, Comparative Exercise Physiology, Catlin and his colleagues at ADR report that they developed an equine test for powerful blood-boosting drug CERA. ADR is currently working to develop an effective urine test to detect human growth hormone (hGH) — one of the most sought-after tests by sports leagues worldwide. (See Mitchell Report (baseball).)
Catlin is Professor Emeritus of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. He also serves as chairman of the Equine Drug Research Institute’s Scientific Advisory Committee and as a member of the Federation Equestre Internationale Commission on Equine Anti-Doping & Medication.

2lor en moi?

2lor en moi ? is French pop singer Lorie's fifth studio album, and her ninth album overall. It was physically released on November 26, 2007 and digitally on September 27, 2007.
History.
While most of her previous records consisted of pop/rock and bubblegum pop songs, Lorie thought it was the moment her music should become "more mature" since her fans "were all growing up". With the help of popular producers, a fresh new album was born, very different from anything Lorie had ever done before. On September 23, 2007, "Je vais vite" was released as the album's lead single to great response and chart success. The album came out three days later; it debuted at #7 in France, less than any other of her albums. Lorie's minor success with "2lor en moi?" has been always linked to the ascending popularity of Yelle, a then-new rising French songstress, to become a competition Lorie has to face; Yelle was presenting a more tecktonik-like sound that was driving teens, not to mention her unique and funky style. Six months after the French release, the album was available on Canadian downloads under the new label, Wolfgang Entertainment International, created by the singer Garou, who currently is Lorie's boyfriend. The album was released on August 19, 2008 and the first single in Canada became "Play". "Play" was released in France on April 7, 2008 but its chart performance and success didn't match those of "Je Vais Vite" but "Play" became popular on its own all across Europe, especially in clubs. On December 5, 2008, the album's third single, "1 Garçon", was released to great response. The promotion was little but the song's lyrics ("parce que t'aime un garçon", which means "because you love a boy") and the video caused much controversy (for some of its scenes like the one when two guys get very close to each other and are about to kiss). In Lebanon, where singles "Je vais vite" and "Play" became #1s on Radio Party, the album sold quite fair and the next single "1 Garçon" is expected to premiere in January 2009.
The song "Où tu n'oses pas" was only available on the digitally version of the album. There were two different versions of the album, the basic version and the collector version, including a DVD with a "making-of" over the creation of the album.
Promotion.
Lorie helped promote both the album and its lead single, "Je vais vite", by performing on shows like "Star Academy" and "Hit Machine". She was also interviewed by multifarious magazines. Three singles have been released until now : "Je vais vite" (September 23, 2007), "Play" (April 7, 2008) and "1 Garçon" (December 5, 2008).
Critical reception.
"2lor en moi?" has been very well received by pop critics. Lorie's previous records were very similar to the old Britney Spears albums but now her come-back album sounds like Kylie Minogue.
Track listings.
- Collector's Edition
The collector's edition contains a DVD with 12 episodes consisting on the preparation and the making of the album:

Gino Bona

Gino Bona (born April 14, 1973) is an American marketing professional. In January 2007, he won the National Football League's "Pitch Us Your Idea For the Best Super Bowl Commercial Ever" contest. His concept was turned into a commercial that aired on February 4, 2007 during the Super Bowl XLI telecast on CBS.
Background.
Gino was born and raised in Buffalo, New York. In 1995, he graduated from Ithaca College with a degree in Television/Radio.
From 1995 to 2001, Gino held various copywriting jobs for advertising agencies and businesses throughout Washington DC. Gino moved to Massachusetts in late 2001 and started writing a weekly sports column on his Web site, “Wink & The Gun.” In December 2002, Gino joined ESPN.com’s Page 2 as a freelance columnist. In addition to writing columns for ESPN.com, Gino teamed up with Eric Kielb to write and record song parodies for Page 2 under the alias “Bristol Bob & The Page 2 Crue.” After contributing dozens of columns and songs, Gino parted ways with ESPN.com in early 2006.
After leaving ESPN.com, Gino joined an advertising agency in Portland, Maine as director of business development. Gino briefly attended Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management in January 2007 to attain his MBA, but dropped out during his second day of studies upon being notified that he won the Super Bowl commercial contest.
"Pitch Us Your Idea for the Best Super Bowl Commercial Ever" Contest.
The National Football League pioneered the consumer-generated trend to advertising’s biggest stage. General Motors and Frito-Lay also held contests for people to have their concepts aired during the Super Bowl XLI telecast.
The National Football League held auditions in New Jersey, Dallas and Denver in November and December 2006. A total of 1,700 football fans auditioned their concepts in these cities. Gino auditioned at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey in November 2006. Gino's pitch centered about fans mourning the end of yet another football season. Over a 90-second period, Gino acted out several scenes of sad football fans. He also sang a brief portion of "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye" by Boyz II Men to set the mood for his concept.
On December 18, 2006, the NFL publicly announced its 12 finalists. That same day, Gino’s wife, Stephanie Parry, gave birth to their son, Quentin Bona, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Gino claimed his son’s initials were merely a "football-related coincidence."
The winner of the contest was determined by a combination of online voting, a group of top league executives and a panel made up of Lisa Baird, senior vice president for the NFL, actor Don Cheadle, and commercial director Joe Pytka. Baird claimed that the league wanted fans to be engaged throughout the entire process.
On January 8, 2007, the National Football League announced that Gino won the contest. He received two tickets to Super Bowl XLI, a trip to the game in Miami, a trip to Los Angeles to attend the commercial shoot, and national media attention, including a feature story on "CBS Evening News with Katie Couric" on February 1, 2007.
The Super Bowl Commercial.
Gino worked with representatives from the NFL and acclaimed director Joe Pytka to create the Super Bowl commercial. Pytka has directed several Super Bowl ads, including the classic McDonald's commercial titled "Nothing But Net," featuring Michael Jordan and Larry Bird.
The commercial was filmed in Los Angeles and Mississippi in January 2007. While many of the scenes from Gino's original pitch in New Jersey remained in the finished commercial, there were some noticeable changes. Gino pitched his concept to the song "It's Hard to Say Goodbye." The commercial featured "Saint James Infirmary" by Louis Armstrong.
The commercial aired during the two minute warning of the fourth quarter.
The end of Gino's commercial was also different from his original pitch. Gino originally suggested that legendary Chicago Bears linebacker be crying as he watched the end of the Super Bowl on TV. Instead of casting Butkus, the spot featured former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre contemplating whether he should retire or return for another season of football. Favre announced his retirement in March 2008, but changed his mind and is now the quarterback for the New York Jets.
Reviews.
The commercial ranked 12th in USA Today's Ad Meter popularity poll, out of the 57 ads that aired during the game, scoring better than ads for Coca-Cola, Taco Bell and General Motors. Adweek listed Gino's commercial as one of the "Best Spots of February 2007."
Post-Super Bowl Life.
By June 2007, Gino had received four job offers for his advertising and marketing services. He ultimately accepted the position of vice president, director of marketing for Camden National Corporation, a bank holding company headquartered in Camden, Maine.
As for the NFL, in February 2008 league spokesman Brian McCarthy told a Boston Globe reporter, "We still talk about Gino's initial pitch at Giants Stadium last year.”

The anime is a remake of the original "Getter Robot" series with no real relationship with the previous anime or manga. Each episode features a different metal beast enemy, a similar format to the TV anime "Mazinger Z". The design of the Getter Robot has some features reminiscent of Mazinger Z, such as a "Rocket Punch" attack. The series also marked the renewal of business relationships between Toei Animation and Go Nagai, which were interrupted by the conflict with "Daiku Maryu Gaiking".

Shamim Karhani

Shamim Karhani, was an eminent Urdu poet ('Shayar') of the 20th century. He was born on 8 June 1913 in village 'Karhan' district Mau, U.P.
Early life, education and employment.
Shamim Karhani () was born in a 'Zamindar' family to Syed Muhammad Akhtar and Ummat ul Zehra on 8 June 1913 in village 'Karhan' district Mau, U.P. in India. His real name was ‘Syed Shamsuddin Haider’. He himself chose ‘Shamim Karhani’ as his pen name ('Takhallus'). Later, this pen name of his became so famous that once, at an interview, when he was asked his name, he himself had to pause for a moment to remember his real name! He did his secondary education from Aligarh Muslim University and also did ‘Maulvi Kamil Munshi’. For his profession, he chose to be a teacher. He worked with Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Schools System, Kaumi Awaz and Anglo Arabic School (New Delhi). He was a scholar of the Persian language; however he did all his poetry in Urdu.
Poetry and India’s freedom struggle.
Shamim had a taste in poetry since he was a kid. He composed his first couplet at the age of eight. He now was aware what he was born for. He started writing and was adored all over Uttar Pradesh. This was the era when India was vehemently trying to get out of snare of British rule. Being an Indian he started writing poems that conveyed the moral of adhesion to one’s own country. These poems became so influential that his popular revolutionary ‘Nazms’ and ‘Naghmas’ (‘Geets’) were sung in the ‘Prabhat-Pheris’ taken out on the streets of cities like Lucknow and Varanasi during the freedom struggle.
Soon Shamim Karhani’s nationalist and revolutionary poetry started attracting the attention of both the common people and the literati. It was through this nationalist platform that he joined the Progressive Writers’ Movement. In 1948 he composed a poem entitled "Jagao Na Bapu Ko Neend Aa Gayi Hai" just after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The above poem had such an emotional appeal that it spread like the jungle fire. Once, Shamim Karhani had the opportunity to recite the poem in the presence of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Nehru, after listening to the poem, got impressed by Shamim’s work and asked him to come to Lucknow to recite his poems in Congress election meetings. Later, after independence, Nehru asked Shamim to come to Delhi. He migrated to Delhi in 1950 and met Nehru at ‘Teen-Murti’. Nehru asked him to compose an epic in Urdu on the freedom movement of India and started giving him a stipend for the job from his personal pocket. On 7 February 1950 he wrote in Shamim’s diary:
His collection entitled “Roshan Andhera” was entirely devoted to the “Quit India Movement”.
Shamim Karhani was a contemporary of eminent poets like Faiz Ahmed 'Faiz', Ali 'Sardar' Jafri, 'Majaz Lucknawi', Moin Ahsan ‘Jazbi’, Ali 'Jawad' Zaidi, etc. Being basically a ‘Ghazal-go’ (one who composes 'Ghazals’), however, tried his hand on each and every ‘genre’ of Urdu 
poetry and some of his compositions found eternal place in Urdu literature. He has composed (apart from ghazals) poems, ‘rubaees’, ‘qataat’, ‘geet’, elegies, ‘marsiyas’, ‘eulogies’ etc.

José Luis Astiazarán

José Luis Astiazarán Iriondo (born 31 October 1963) is a Spanish lawyer specializing in sport and commercial and civil law, and between 2005 and 2013 president of the Liga de Fútbol Profesional.
Football career.
Astiazarán was born in Mexico City, Mexico to a Spanish couple of Basque descent, returning to his parents' region of birth shortly after. A forward, he graduated from Real Sociedad's youth academy but only represented its reserves as a senior, the same happening at his following team, Athletic Bilbao.
Astiazarán played professionally for Sestao Sport Club– also in his native region – and Bilbao Athletic, appearing in a total of 43 Segunda División games during his short career (four goals). In 1992 he returned to his first club, working with its board of directors until 2001.
Law career.
While still working with Real Sociedad as a director, Astiazarán also acted as legal adviser for athletes, companies and institutions in the sports sector. He became president of the club on 22 March 2001 and left the position in 2005, leaving the club in a poor sporting and economic situation – €10 million worth of debt.
On 15 July 2005 Astiazarán was appointed president of the Liga de Fútbol Profesional (Professional Football League), the body governing both La Liga and the second division. Having earlier served as vice president and member of the board of directors in the organization, he won the election unanimously, with all but three clubs – Real Sociedad, SD Eibar and CA Osasuna – showing him support; he was re-elected in April 2009 for another period of four years, and in 2013 Javier Tebas took over as president after he did not present himself for reelection.
Astiazarán is a member of the European Professional Football Leagues board of directors, and a member of the FIFA Player's Status Committee sub-committee, which verifies the transfers of minor players. In mid-May 2009, he claimed the 6+5 rule wouldn't have a negative impact on Spanish football.

The Ting River () flows 300 km from Changting County in western Fujian south to the port and Special Economic Zone of Shantou, Guangdong. 
The former prefecture of Tingzhou fu or T'ingchow-fu (汀州府) was administered from a centre on the upper river, now the town of Tingzhou in Changting County; all these places are named for the river. As most inhabitants of Tingzhou-fu/Changting are Hakka, and as (Hakka-speaking) Meizhou (梅州) is next downstream, the Tingjiang is considered by some to be "the mother river of all the Hakkas". 
The Tingjiang is unique among Fujianese rivers in that its lower watershed and debouchement are outside the province. The traffic in Tingzhou-fu/Changting then (before road and rail came very recently) was always primarily with eastern areas of Guangdong, namely Meizhou and, further down, the Min-Nan-speaking "Chao-Shan" area -- Chaozhou (潮州) and Shantou (汕头).

Battle of Jaquijahuana

The Battle of Jaquijahuana was fought between the forces of Gonzalo Pizarro and Pedro de la Gasca, on April 9, 1548, during the Conquest of the Inca Empire by the Spanish conquistadores.
After the successful Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the assassination of Francisco Pizarro in 1541, and the execution of his main antagonist, Diego de Almagro (1538) and his son, El Mozo (1542), most of the competent commanders of the recently founded New Castile Governorate had been lost in the ensuing power struggle. In 1540, second in line of the Pizarro brothers, Hernando Pizarro, returned to Spain to defend the question of his and his brothers' reign in Peru against accusations of abuse of power. He was eventually imprisoned on orders of King Charles. The Almagristas, followers of Diego de Almagro, met their downfall in the battle of Chupas on September 16, 1542. Two years later, King Charles eventually sent his own envoy, Blasco Núñez Vela, as governor over the recently found Viceroyalty of Peru, and as well to ensure the accomplishment of the New Laws enacted in 1542 to protect the native Peruvian population of Peru. 
Gonzalo Pizarro, however, refused to relinquish power and the sovereignty over Peru once belonging to him and his brothers. With his namesake as an ensuring symbol of the former reign of the Pizarros, he gathered supporters, mainly opposed by formal governor of New Castile, Cristóbal Vaca de Castro, victor at Chupas over the Almagristas. The Viceroy arrived at Lima, new capital of Peru, and was sworn into office on May 17, 1544. He shortly after had Castro imprisoned and sent home to Spain. On September 18, Gonzalo Pizarro managed to depose Blasco Núñez Vela and sent him as prisoner to Panama. On October 28, the 1,200 men strong army of Gonzalo Pizarro entered Lima. Upon arrival to Panama, however, Vela was released, and returned to Peru with royal claims as the rightful viceroy and governor of Peru, landing in Tumbes. The two gathered supporters and met on January 18, 1546 at Añaquito in present-day Ecuador, superiority in numbers and firepower ensured victory for Gonzalo Pizarro, who crushed the army of Blasco Núñez Vela, who was decapitated on the field of battle. This, in its turn, ensured a struggle for the control of Peru between Gonzalo Pizarro and the royal forces.
The king then appointed Pedro de la Gasca as new governor of Peru; meanwhile, the land itself fell under control by Gonzalo Pizarro and his forces. De la Gasca landed in Peru in 1547, winning supporters to his initially inferior forces by promising amnesty to those having committed treason to the crown, and proclaimed he would not enforce the New Laws, a keepsake that had entrusted Gonzalo Pizarro a number of loyal supporters.
After initial skirmishes, the two forces went close to a confrontation in late 1547 at Xaguijagana plains, but de la Gasca succeeded in avoiding battle and winning the case of several other officers of Gonzalo Pizarro, among them the recognizable Alonso de Alvarado. Ultimately, a battle ensuring the definite control of Peru was unavoidable, and the two armies finally met close to Sacsahuana, on Spanish dubbed "Jaquijahuana", near Cuzco. In the battle itself, Gonzalo's forces were at this time gravely inferior and were slaughtered on field of battle, with almost none of de la Gasca's forces killed. Gonzalo himself, along with his most loyal commander, Francisco de Carvajal, dubbed the "Deamon of the Andes", were captured on field of battle and executed by beheading. De la Gasca then made efforts to solidate his control over Peru, which remained a royal colony and viceroyalty until the revolutionary actions of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar during early 19th century.

Foster Kennedy syndrome

Foster Kennedy syndrome (also known as Gowers-Paton-Kennedy syndrome, Kennedy's phenomenon or Kennedy's syndrome) refers to a constellation of findings associated with tumors of the frontal lobe.
Although "Foster Kennedy syndrome" is equated with "Kennedy syndrome", it should not be confused with Kennedy disease, which is named for W. R. Kennedy.
"Pseudo-Foster Kennedy syndrome" is defined as one-sided optic atrophy with papilledema in the other eye but with the absence of a mass.
Presentation.
The syndrome is defined as the following changes: 
This syndrome is due to optic nerve compression, olfactory nerve compression, and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to a mass (such as meningioma or plasmacytoma, usually an olfactory groove meningioma). There are other symptoms present in some cases such as nausea and vomiting, memory loss and emotional lability (i.e. frontal lobe signs).
History.
The syndrome was first extensively noted by Robert Foster Kennedy in 1911, a British neurologist, who spent most of his career working in the United States of America. However, the first mention of the syndrome came from a William Gowers in 1893. Schultz-Zehden described the symptoms again in 1905. A later description was written by Wilhelm Uhthoff in 1915.
Treatment and prognosis.
The treatment, and therefore prognosis, varies depending upon the underlying tumour.

Rotary mower

A rotary mower is a unit of powered machinery that uses a rotating blade or blades to cut vegetation.
In agriculture a rotary mower takes the form of a piece of tractor machinery that is often pulled behind the tractor and powered by the Power take-off; it uses thick blades of sharpened metal to cut thick grass, heavy bushes, weeds, and small trees. Due to the high torque and power associated with the implement, shields made of hanging heavy chain or thick vinyl or rubber are often provided around the discharge chute to control flying debris. French agricultural machinery manufacturer Rousseau SA claims to have invented the mechanical rotary mower in 1962.
In horticulture a rotary mower is usually an integral machine that is either pushed by hand or driven by a riding operator, and used to cut amenity and sports turf. The first successful such machine was developed in Australia in 1952 by the Victa company.

Stanley Boulter

Stanley Carr Boulter (29 May 1852 – 5 January 1917) was a British lawyer and businessman, who established The Law Debenture Corporation. In 1902, he married Helen Carte, widow of Richard D'Oyly Carte, and he assisted in the financing of the Savoy hotel group.
Education and career.
Boulter was educated at Clare College, Cambridge before being called to the Bar in 1879. During his legal career, he was at one point editor of the Law Reports in "The Times". As a barrister he concentrated on commercial and financial civil cases. Such criminal cases as he took were generally concerned with fraud and breaches of bankruptcy laws. From 1885 onwards he was sufficiently eminent to appear before the Court of Appeal.
In 1889, Boulter turned his energies to finance. He was one of the founders of the Law Debenture Corporation, of which he remained the chairman until his death. He was also chairman of the Imperial Colonial Finance and Agency Corporation, and the New Investment Company. "The Times" called him "one of the leading representatives of the great Trust Companies... Nobody was better than Mr. Boulter at handling a difficult meeting of shareholders ... and restoring confidence."
In politics, Boulter began as a Liberal, but disagreed with his party leader, W. E. Gladstone, over Irish home rule. Boulter stood unsuccessfully as a "Liberal Unionist" in the general election of 1886, and his political views came to be aligned with those of the Conservative party, particularly on any matters affecting the integrity of the British empire. In social politics he remained more liberal, advocating public assistance for working men to buy homes. In his later years, he was a Justice of the Peace for Surrey.
Family.
The son of John Boulter of Frimley, Surrey, Boulter first married Edith "née" Anderson. There were three sons and four daughters of the marriage. Edith died in 1896. In 1902, he married Helen Carte. Her first husband, Richard D'Oyly Carte, had built and operated both the Savoy Theatre and Savoy Hotel. Boulter used the Law Debenture Corporation to assist in raising funds for expansion of the hotel and was appointed vice-chairman of the Savoy hotel group. After his wife's death in 1913, he continued as vice-chairman and assisted the new chairman, her stepson Rupert D'Oyly Carte, with matters related to the D'Oyly Carte businesses.
Boulter died in London in 1917 at the age of 64.

Multigraph (orthography)

A multigraph is a sequence of letters that behaves as a unit and is not the sum of its parts, such as English or French . The term is infrequently used, as the number of letters is usually specified:
Combinations longer than tetragraphs are unusual. The German pentagraph has largely been replaced by , remaining only in proper names such as or . Except for doubled trigraphs like German , hexagraphs are found only in Irish vowels, where the outside letters indicate whether the neighboring consonant is "broad" or "slender". However, these sequences are not predictable. The hexagraph , for example, where the and mark the consonants as broad, represents the same sound (approximately the vowel in English "write") as the trigraph , and with the same effect on neighboring consonants. 
The seven-letter German sequence , used to transliterate Russian , as in for "borscht", is a sequence of a trigraph and a tetragraph rather than a heptagraph. Likewise, the Juu languages have been claimed to have a heptagraph , but this is also a sequence, of and . 
Beyond the Latin alphabet, Morse code uses hexagraphs for several punctuation marks, and the dollar sign is a heptagraph, . Longer sequences are considered ligatures, and are transcribed as such in the Latin alphabet.

Red Riding Hoodwinked

Red Riding Hoodwinked is a "Looney Tunes" cartoon animated short starring Tweety and Sylvester. Released October 29, 1955, the cartoon is directed by Friz Freleng. The voices are performed by Mel Blanc and June Foray.
The cartoon was Warner Bros.' latest adaptation of the "Little Red Riding Hood" children's story, with the Big Bad Wolf and Granny playing their respective roles, with Tweety and Sylvester taking appropriate sides.
Unlike her previous appearances, the usually cheerful Granny here is a female caricature of Ralph Kramden (of television's "The Honeymooners"), complete with ill-temperedness and use of the catchphrase, "One of these days ... pow! Right in the kisser." As such, "Red Riding Hoodwinked" marked one of the earliest parodies of "The Honeymooners". In addition, this cartoon marks the first time Foray voiced the character of Granny, replacing Bea Benaderet in the role. Also, Granny's appearance is updated: Although she appears as a sourpuss here, her physical attributes (such as a less-pronounced chin) would be used in future appearances. Also, Granny's old-fashioned ways would be de-emphasized.
The wolf character would re-appear in "Hare-Less Wolf".
Plot.
The story begins much like the classic fairy tale, with Red Riding Hood off to see her grandmother, who lives in the woods. The present she plans to bring her grandmother is Tweety (in his cage). Sylvester sees Red's cargo and immediately begins going after her, his primary interest being Tweety. Red boards the bus, but Sylvester continues after her as it drives into the woods, the inattentive cat striking a road sign along the way.
In the woods, the Big Bad Wolf — rougher looking in appearance than in later shorts — waits for Red to come by. A sign announces who Big Bad is, much to his disgust. Sylvester overhears the requisite exchange of Big Bad asking Red where she is headed and soon joins Big Bad in trying to reach Granny's house first.
Big Bad ousts Granny from the house, to which she immediately swears revenge (mimicking Ralph Kramden's signature lines). Big Bad and Sylvester hurriedly dress in Granny's clothing in anticipation of Red's arrival. Big Bad takes his place in the bed after shooing Sylvester underneath. Once Red arrives and presents "Grandma" with Tweety, she sets it down as asked; Sylvester immediately approaches the cage, prompting Tweety to ask: "Hewwo, Wittle Wed Widing Hood's Gwandma! Whatcha doin' under da bed?" After the signature exchange ending with "The better to see, smell, and eat you with," and each character's realization of their sworn enemy (Red: "Oh! The Big Bad Wolf!" Tweety: "Eek! The Big Bad Puddy Tat!"), the chase begins.
After several back-and-forth chases, with Big Bad and Sylvester getting the worse end of things, Red and Tweety flee Granny's home and head for the nearest bus stop. Their pursuers chase after the bus and immediately board at the next stop, only to be forcibly ejected by none other than Granny, who then shouts, "I told them, one of these days...!" Red and Tweety supply the rest of the line: "Pow! Right/wight in the kisser!" The screen irises out.

Robert Briçonnet (c.1450 – 3 June 1497) was a French churchman and courtier, and Archbishop of Reims from 1493.
Life.
He was the fifth son of Jean Briçonnet, and an elder brother of the Cardinal Guillaume Briçonnet. He owed much to the credit which Guillaume had with Charles VIII of France, when it came to his rapid elevation to public offices and dignities.
He was named Canon of St.-Aignan at Orléans, Abbot of the rich Abbey of St. Vaast at Arras, and in 1493 he was raised to the archiepiscopal See of Reims, four years before the Cardinal himself was appointed to that see.
Charles also appointed him President of the Superior Tribunal of Finances, and Chancellor of France. He enjoyed this new dignity for only twenty-two months before his death, which occurred at Moulins. He showed himself, as did his brothers and nephews, a patron of men of letters.

Henry Townsend (Oyster Bay)

Henry Townsend (1649–1703) was the son of Henry Townsend, an early settler of the American Colonies.
Biography.
Henry Townsend (1649-1703) was the son of Henry Townsend who emigrated to the colonies from England. Eventually Henry Townsend settled in Oyster Bay, where his son Henry Townsend was raised. Townsend Society of America DNA testing project has established that the Oyster Bay family is not related to Thomas Townsend of Lynn, MA. The county of origin in England for Henry, John and Richard Townsend is not known. 
Henry Townsend married Deborah Underhill in 1657. Deborah Underhill (1659-1698) was daughter of Captain John Underhill (1597-1672), another important figure in Colonial America who trained the militia of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and served as magistrate of Flushing for a brief period of time, before settling on of land outside of Oyster Bay. Captain Underhill was converted to Quakerism by his second wife, thus making the union of Henry Townsend and Deborah Underhill the combining of two of the most influential Quaker families in Oyster Bay.
They had at least four children together: Robert Townsend (b. 1687), Elizabeth Townsend (1692-1756), Henry (d. 1709) and Uriah Townsend (1698-1767).

The 1980 NFL season would see the Dolphins drop to an 8–8 record, from their AFC East division winning 10–6 showing the previous year.
Quarterback Bob Griese, who struggled with leg problems during 1979, lost the starting job to longtime backup Don Strock, but he did poorly in two games, leading the Dolphins to return to Griese for Week 3. In Week 5, however, Griese suffered a career-ending shoulder injury against the Baltimore Colts and was succeeded by David Woodley, a rookie fresh from LSU.
The final game of the season was played against the New York Jets on December 20. NBC tried a novel experiment by broadcasting the game with no commentators, and with none of the players or staff wearing microphones. The effect was to give television viewers the feel of actually being in the stadium. To date, this was the only NFL game ever aired on TV without commentaries. The Jets won by a score of 24–17, though both teams had already been eliminated from playoff contention.

<doc id="18847747" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18847747" title="Armor of God">
Armor of God

The phrase "Armor of God" is derived from Ephesians 6:11: "Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes" (New International Version). As a Biblical reference, the metaphor may refer to physical armor worn by God in metaphorical battles, or it may refer to vigilant righteousness in general as bestowed by the grace of God (Romans , New International Version): "The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light." 
The full Armor of God quote outlines these aspects of belief: truth, righteousness, preparation of the Gospel of peace, faith, salvation and the Word of God and Prayer.
Quotes.
The full quote as outlined in the King James Bible, is from Apostle Paul's letter to the Ephesians : "(10) Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. (11) Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. (12) For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. (13) Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. (14) Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; (15) And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; (16) Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. (17) And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: (18) Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;" 
Context.
Other related passages, by Apostle Paul and references by later theologians, indicate a metaphorical context for the Armor of God. For instance, Paul's letter to the Romans indicates not a literal, but a figurative, application of the concept (Romans , New International Version): "(12) The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. (13) Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. (14) Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature." 
In terms of the parts of the Armor of God, the various pieces (the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the "shoes" of the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit) are correlated to what Paul would have witnessed firsthand as the arms and armor of Roman legionaries during his life in the Roman Empire.
Interpretations.
In Biblical exegesis, the vast majority of Biblical scholars, Catholic, Protestant, and otherwise, agree that Paul the Apostle used the concept as a reference to spiritual battle with the Devil. Christians are to put on this armor and deal well with its upkeeping. This armor seems to be in direct correlation of that of the Roman Empire's soldiers.
Pieces of Armor.
In the Biblical text of Ephesians chapter 6, there are 6 pieces of armor: the helmet, shield, loins, feet, sword, and breastplate. These pieces have a description of what they are: helmet of salvation, shield of faith, loins girt with truth (belt of truth), feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace (peace), the sword of the spirit/word of God, and the breastplate of righteousness.
The helmet of Salvation and the breastplate of Righteousness also appear in Isaiah 59:17

List of Mecklenburg locomotives

This list contains an overview of Mecklenburg locomotives built from 1848 to 1922, and is based on the classification scheme of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway ("Großherzoglich Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahn").
Context.
Mecklenburg is a region in northern Germany comprising the western and larger part of the present day state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Its largest cities are Rostock, Schwerin, and Neubrandenburg. In 1815, the two Mecklenburg duchies – Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz – were raised to Grand Duchies, and subsequently existed separately in Germany until the end of World War I. The earlier private railways were nationalised by 1890 into the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway.
Overview of the locomotives.
Mecklenburg locomotives were given a name as well as a number at the outset, the names being mainly chosen from geographical features in Mecklenburg. This naming of locomotives ceased in 1895.
Originally, locomotive numbers followed the sequence in which they were produced. In 1890, on nationalisation, however, a new numbering scheme was introduced. Each class was allocated a specific range of numbers. The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway divided the locomotives into the following different classes:
In 1910 a new scheme was introduced that broadly conformed to the Prussian system. This entailed allocating group letters as follows: the letter P to passenger train locomotives ("Personenzuglokomotiven"), G to goods train locomotives ("Güterzuglokomotiven") and T to tank locomotives ("Tenderlokomotiven"). Individual classes were distinguished by an Arabic numeral after the letter. To specify the sub-class, superscripts were used. So, for example, locomotives with simple steam expansion were to be given a "1" and compound locomotives a "2".
Steam locomotives.
Early locomotives for mixed traffic.
These locomotives were all built for the Mecklenburg Railway Company and went into the fleet of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway on nationalisation.
Narrow gauge locomotives.
The Mecklenburg narrow gauge locomotives were built for a rail gauge of and were procured for duties on the "Bäderbahn" Doberan-Heiligendamm–Arendsee.

Battle of Chupas

After the assassination of Francisco Pizarro, in retaliation for his father's execution in 1538, Diego de Almagro II, "El Mozo", continued to press claims as the rightful ruler of Peru and as leader of his father's supporters. His claims were largely unsuccessful, however, as Pizarro was succeeded as governor by Cristóbal Vaca de Castro, despite claims from his brother Gonzalo Pizarro, whose claims to join arms against the Almagristas and "El Mozo" largely remained unanswered.
Desperate not to face the same fate as his father after the battle of Las Salinas, Diego de Almagro II gathered an army of supporters but was defeated outside Cuzco at Chupas, on 16 September 1542, the year following Pizarro's murder, and was executed the same day on the city plaza after a brief trial.

<doc id="18847783" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18847783" title="Elite party">
Elite party

An elite party is a political party consisting of members of the societal elite, particularly members of parliament, who agree to co-operate politically in the spirit of principles and goals. The first to describe this party model was Edmund Burke in 1770. More recently, the elite party model has been outlined by Maurice Duverger.
Elite parties form as groupings of elite members particularly in situations where an individual politician's political standing can be secured without the support of large populations. An elite party can form internally in the parliament and its political power is derived from that of its individual members. Elite parties have practically no extra-parliamentary structure and a generally more flexible than mass parties. The central role of independent, powerful individuals implies that their structure is often loose and that their policy may be internally disputed due to disagreements between individual members. As Duverger states, in elite parties "the members of Parliament play a key role".
Elite parties are contrasted to mass parties that largely consist of "masses" of laymen. Mass parties can be democratic, such as decentralized liberal parties, or massive but centrally controlled like Nazi or Communist parties; these are occasionally classified separately.
Elite parties, despite their origin in the elite, need not to be elitist and may represent any ideology. For example, there have been elite parties supporting ideologies as diverse and conflicting as classical liberalism, nationalism and aristocracy/elitism.
A prominent example of a political system based on elite parties were the Hats and Caps parties in Sweden during the Age of Liberty (1719–1772).

Guillaume Briçonnet (Cardinal)

Guillaume Briçonnet (1445 – 1514) was a French Cardinal and statesman.
Life.
Born at Tours, Guillaume Briçonnet was a younger son of Jean Briçonnet, Lord of Varennes, in Touraine, Secretary to the king and collector-general of Customs. Appointed Superintendent of Finances for the Province of Languedoc under Louis XI of France, Guillaume Briçonnet discharged the duties of his office with such integrity and efficiency, and showed himself so devoted to the interests of Louis that that monarch recommended him to his successor. Charles VIII of France made him Secretary of the Treasury, raised him to the first place in the Council of State, and, according to the historian Francesco Guicciardini, would undertake nothing in the government of his kingdom without the advice of Briçonnet. 
Ludovico Sforza, called the Moor, wishing to dispossess his nephew of the Duchy of Milan, and finding himself opposed by Ferdinand I of Naples, sent an embassy under the Count of Belgiojoso to Charles to induce the French king to assert his claims to the Kingdom of Naples as heir to the house of Anjou. Sforza promised to place all his troops at the king's service. Briçonnet having shortly before this lost his wife, Raoulette de Beaune, by whom he had three sons, had entered the ecclesiastical state and been named Bishop of St.-Malo. To flatter his ambition the Milanese ambassadors assured him that the king's influence would raise him to the cardinalate. Briçonnet, thus won over to the Sforza interest, adroitly encouraged the warlike dispositions of his sovereign, triumphed over the opposition of the royal council, of the Duke of Bourbon, and of Anne of France, the Duke's wife, influenced Charles to sign a secret treaty with Sforza, and assured the king of his ability to raise the funds necessary to carry on the war both on land and sea.
Pope Alexander VI, alarmed at the apparent danger threatening Italy, promised the cardinal's hat to Briçonnet if he could prevail upon Charles to abandon his enterprise; but Briçonnet, realizing that he could not govern without flattering the king's passion for conquest, urged him on, and, notwithstanding the dilapidated state of the treasury, succeeded in meeting the expenses of the war. Accompanying Charles on his expedition, he provoked a mutiny in the French army, by his treachery in sacrificing the Pisans, allies of France, to their enemies, the Florentines, and had he not hidden himself form the fury of the soldiers they would have taken his life. Upon this occasion, as upon others, Briçonnet's ambition led him into conduct at variance with his motto: "Ditat servata fides". Charles had entered Rome as a conqueror, greatly irritated against Alexander VI who had stirred up opposition against him; but the adroit Briçonnet reconciled his royal master with the pope, and for reward received the cardinal's hat. This honour was conferred in a special consistory held in the king's presence, 16 January 1495, the new cardinal taking the title of Cardinal of St.-Malo, from his episcopal see.
Briçonnet soon had cause to repent the advice he had given to invade Italy. A formidable league was formed for the purpose of cutting off the French retreat, and neither the diplomacy nor the entreaties of the French cardinal had any effect on the hostile generals. The prowess of Charles and the valour of his troops alone saved the French from defeat. With 8,000 men the king defeated, at Tornovo, an army of 40,000, and opened a road to France. Soon after this Briçonnet, induced by a tempting promise of preferment for one of his sons, tried to persuade Charles to break off the peace negotiations and support with an army the Duke of Orleans' claims to the Duchy of Milan. Charles, however, preferred the counsels of Philippe de Comines and sacrificed the interests of the duke, and the king's premature death put an end to the influence of Briçonnet, Louis XII giving his confidence to the Cardinal d'Amboise. 
Whilst serving his king and the State, the Cardinal of St.-Malo had not overlooked his own interests; he had obtained from Alexander VI the Bishopric of Nimes. His title being disputed by the nominee of the chapter, there arose a litigation which lasted until the year 1507, when Briçonnet was awarded the title. In 1497 he had received "in commendam" the Bishopric of Toulon, and in the same year succeeded his brother Robert Briçonnet in the archiepiscopal See of Reims. On 27 May 1498, he crowned Louis XII in his cathedral and followed the king to Paris. As a peer of France, he assisted at the session of the Council of State at which the marriage of Louis with Jeanne, the daughter of Louis XI, was annulled.
When he had ceased to be a minister of State, Briçonnet retired to Rome for two years. Louis then made use of his talents to check what he called the arrogance of the warrior pope, Julius II. By his king's direction Briçonnet took steps to assemble at Pisa a council of cardinals opposed to the policy of Julius, and bent on the reformation of the head and hierarchy of the Church. He left Rome suddenly and secretly with a group of cardinals whom he had won over, and opened his council at Pisa, but soon transferred it to Milan, and thence to Lyon. He was, however, summoned to appear before the pope, was deprived of the Roman purple and excommunicated. Louis, on his side, bestowed upon him in commendam the rich Abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés and the government of Languedoc.
At the death of Julius II Briçonnet was absolved from all censures and excommunication, and restored by Pope Leo X to the Sacred College. He then retired to end his days at Narbonne, for which see he had exchanged Reims. He was buried in a superb mausoleum which he had built for himself in the church of Our Lady.
Whilst in power, Briçonnet showed himself a patron of men of letters; they dedicated their works to him and became his panegyrists. He was called "oraculum regis" and "regni columna". His life was in fact swayed by ambition and occupied by intrigues. He composed a manual of Latin prayers, dedicated to Charles VIII. At Saint-Malo he issued several synodal instructions.

Kevin Bell (baseball)

Kevin Robert Bell (born July 13, 1955) is a retired American professional baseball player who appeared in all or part of six seasons in Major League Baseball between 1976 and 1982, primarily as a third baseman.
Bell was the first-round pick (7th overall) of the Chicago White Sox in the 1974 Major League Baseball Draft. Selected after just one season at Mt. San Antonio College, he was placed on the fast track to the majors, and was the youngest player in the major leagues when he debuted in 1976. On June 22 of that year, he hit a rare inside-the-park grand slam home run against Steve Busby of the Kansas City Royals, and he finished that season with a .248 batting average and 5 home runs in 230 at bats.
Despite his young age, Bell never really developed beyond that. After two more years spent mostly in the minor leagues, he had a season very similar to '76 in 1979, when he batted .245 with 4 home runs in 200 at bats. In 1980, he regressed to a .178 average, and he was released by the White Sox after the season.
Bell was picked up by the San Diego Padres, but before the 1981 season had even begun, he was shipped off to the Oakland Athletics along with two minor leaguers in exchange for pitcher Bob Lacey. One of those minor leaguers would turn out to be long-time A's star Tony Phillips. Bell himself fared less well, getting just 9 more at bats in the majors in 1982 before calling it a career.

Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson

The Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson or the Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, LL.D. During the Last Twenty Years of His Life by Hester Thrale, also known as Hester Lynch Piozzi, was first published 26 March 1786. It was based on the various notes and anecdotes of Samuel Johnson that Thrale kept in her "Thraliana". Thrale wrote the work in Italy while she lived there for three years after marrying Gabriel Piozzi.
Background.
Before Thrale began to write the "Thraliana", she kept two sets of anecdotes: the first was devoted to Samuel Johnson and the other for miscellaneous events. She relied on these, along with her memory, to write the early portions of her work.
After Johnson's death, Thrale decided to publish a series of anecdotes of Johnson's life based on the various notes and anecdotes, called Johnsoniana by her friends, that she incorporated into her "Thraliana". She was eager to start publishing her writings, and Johnson's death gave her the opportunity. Thrale wrote the work in Italy while she lived there for three years after marrying Gabriel Piozzi.
The work was first published 26 March 1786. In 1815, Thrale claimed:
"At Rome we received letters saying the book was bought with such avidity, that Cadell hadnot one copy left when the King sent for it at ten o'clock at night, and he was forced to be one from a friend to supply his Majesty's impatience, who sate up all night reading it. I received (pound symbol)300, a sum unexampled in those days for so small a volume." The "Gentleman's Magazine" of March 1786 said "On the third morning after the book was published not a copy of it could be obtained". The book went into four editions during 1786.
Anecdotes.
Thrale began her work by stating in the Preface:
"I have somewhere heard of read, that the Preface before a book, like the portico before a house, should be contrived, so as to catch, but not detain the attention of those who desire admission to the family within, or leave to look over the collection of pictures made by one whose opportunities of obtaining them we know to have been not unfrequent. I wish not to keep my readers long from such intimacy with the manners of Dr. Johnson, or such knowledge of his sentiments as these pages can convey. To urge my distance from England as an excuse for the book's being ill written, would be ridiculous; it might indeed serve as a just reason for my having written it at all; because, though others may print the same aphorisms and stories, I cannot "here" be sure that they have done so... 
I am aware that many will say, I have not spoken highly enough of Dr. Johnson; but it will be difficult for those who say so, to speak more highly, If I have described his manners as they were, I have been careful to shew his superiority to the common forms of common life...
When I have said, that he was more a man of genius than of learning, I mean not to take from the one part of his character that which I willingly give to the other. The erudition of Mr. Johnson proved his genius; for he had not acquired it by long or profound study...
But I must conclude my Preface, and begin my book, the first I ever presented before the Public; from whose awful appearance in some measure to defend and conceal myself... Studious however to avoid offending, and careful of that offence which can be taken without a cause, I here not unwillingly submit my slight performance to the decision of that glorious country, which I have the daily delight to hear applauded in others, as eminently just, generous, and humane.
Critical response.
Horace Walpole quickly responded to the work in a letter 28 March 1786:
"Two days ago appeared Madame Piozzi's "Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson". I am lamentably disappointed - in her, I mean; not in him. I had conceived a favourable opinion of her capacity. But this new book is wretched; a high-varnished preface to a heap of rubbish, in a very vulgar style, and too void of method even for such a farrago."
On 30 April 1786 he followed with another:
"As she must have heard that the whole first impression was sold the first day, no doubt she expects, on her landing to be received like the Governor of Gibraltar, and to find the road strewed with branches of palm. She, and Boswell, and their Hero are the joke of the public."
Edmond Malone said, "On the whole the public is indebted to her for her lively, though very inaccurate and artful account of Dr. Johnson". James Clifford declared that the "Anecdotes" and the "Thraliana" "established her reputation as a bluestocking writer of the late eighteenth century". Martine Brownley claims that the "Anecdotes" "have long pleased Johnsonians", but her "lasting literary fame is due to her diaries and letters".

Conductor of an abelian variety

In mathematics, in Diophantine geometry, the conductor of an abelian variety defined over a local or global field "F" is a measure of how "bad" the bad reduction at some prime is. It is connected to the ramification in the field generated by the torsion points.
For an abelian variety "A" defined over a field "F" as above, with ring of integers "R", consider the Néron model of "A", which is a 'best possible' model of "A" defined over "R". This model may be represented as a scheme over 
(cf. spectrum of a ring) for which the generic fibre constructed by means of the morphism
gives back "A". Let "A"0 denote the open subgroup scheme of the Néron model whose fibres are the connected components. For a maximal ideal "P" of "A" with residue field "k", "A"0"k" is a group variety over "k", hence an extension of an abelian variety by a linear group. This linear group is an extension of a torus by a unipotent group. Let "uP" be the dimension of the unipotent group and "tP" the dimension of the torus. The order of the conductor at "P" is
where formula_2 is a measure of wild ramification. When "F" is a number field, the conductor ideal of "A" is given by

Saving for Education, Entrepreneurship, and Downpayment

Saving for Education, Entrepreneurship, and Downpayment (SEED) Policy and Practice Initiative is a long-term savings and investment account policy and practice endeavor that develops, tests and impels matched savings accounts and financial education for children and youth. The SEED accounts are installed at birth with an initial deposit of $1,000, and accumulates over the span of a lifetime. All the money will be invested in children’s savings accounts for future purposes.
Established in 2003, the SEED initiative accrues deposits from family, friends, and accountholders themselves, as well as augmented by other public and private sources. Each voluntary contribution from any public or private sector should be invented by a public match that increases in value over time for lower-income families.
Requirements.
Any SEED account policy should encompass the following specifications:
• Inclusive:
Accounts should be established at birth for every child in America. 
• Seeded with an initial deposit:
Every newborn should receive a modest but significant start-in-life deposit. 
• Configured to establish lifelong assets:
Savings should be held until at least age 18 and should be used for only higher education/training, small business development, home purchase, or retirement. 
• Matched progressively:
Voluntary additional contributions from any public or private source (e.g. family, friends, relatives, community organizations, and parents' employers) should be invented by a public match that increases in value for lower-income families.
• Simplicity:
Parameters of the account should be kept as simple as possible to enable low-cost, high- scale delivery (e.g. simple match rates, tax incentives, deposit structure, integration into tax forms). 
• Private-market oriented:
Accounts should be held primarily in private financial institutions that provide limited investment options. 
• Savings should be used to build financial aspirations, knowledge, and skills: Age-appropriate financial education should be delivered by a variety of sources (e.g. financial institutions, nonprofit organizations, youth development organizations, schools, and families). 
• Non-discriminatory to welfare participants: Eligibility for means-tested programs should not be affected by savings in SEED accounts.
Investment Results.
By initially investing $1,000 for a child at birth with a 6% rate of return will yield a resulted investment of $3,000 after 18 years. Additionally, adding $100 per year onto the base will accrue up to $5,000. By adding $50 a month to the slated $1,000 base will return more than $22,000.
The financial sum of $3,000 - $22,000 can be seen as a financial catalyst to fueling a child’s college education. Typically, costs to attend a 2-year college are just below $2,000 a year and a 4-year public colleges are just under $4,000 a year.

Darren Dykes

Daren Dykes (born 28 April 1981) is an English footballer. He played professionally as an attacking midfielder for Swindon Town and Lincoln City and currently plays for Newport Pagnell Town as a centre-forward.
Career.
Early career.
Dykes began his career on the books of Tottenham Hotspur as a schoolboy until he was 15 before joining the youth set-up at Leyton Orient where he remained until he was 17. He moved into non-league football with Newport Pagnell Town before joining Buckingham Town in January 2001.
League career.
A series of impressive performances for Buckingham saw Dykes attract the attention of scouts from the Football League and in July 2002 joined Swindon Town initially on trial before agreeing a one-year contract. He made his Swindon debut as a substitute in the 2–1 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in the Football League Cup on 11 September 2002 and made a further two appearances in the Football League Trophy before joining Lincoln City on loan in December 2002. He was immediately inserted into the first team, making his Football League debut as a substitute in the 1–1 away draw with York City on 20 December 2002. After starting Lincoln's next two games, he was dropped to the bench and his loan deal was not renewed. Returning to Swindon, Dykes made two further league appearances before being released at the end of the season.
Return to non-League football.
Following his release by Swindon, Dykes had an unsuccessful trial with Maltese side Marsaxlokk before returning to Buckingham Town. He would make only five appearances, two in the United Counties League and three in the FA Cup, in his return to the club before suffering a serious cruciate ligament injury in the 2–0 FA Cup victory over Ford Sports Daventry on 30 August 2003. The injury would keep him out of action for over two years. 
In November 2005 he made a return to the United Counties League, scoring on his debut for Stotfold in the 3–1 victory over St Ives Town on 22 November 2005. He joined Stony Stratford Town ahead of the 2006–2007 season. Playing in a more advanced role, he was a regular goalscorer for the club, netting a total of 22 goals in his first season, though only 10 of these came in the league. The following season saw him reach a total of 38 goals in all competitions, with 27 in the league.
In June 2008 he moved up the non-league pyramid joining Rugby Town, debuting in the 2–0 away defeat to Bedford Town on 25 August 2008. Rugby's manager Rod Brown moved to Bromsgrove Rovers at the beginning of September 2008 with Tony Dobson appointed in his place. Dykes quickly moved on from Rugby Town, linking up with his one-time Buckingham Town manager Morell Maison at Halesowen Town. His spell at Rugby comprised a total of seven games, five in the league, and two goals, both of which came in the 5–3 FA Cup 1st Qualifying Round Replay home victory over Friar Lane & Epworth on 16 September 2008. However, he made only a single appearance for Halesowen before returning to Rugby where injury restricted his outtings and he temporarily linked up with former club Buckingham Town to gain fitness. He returned to Newport Pagnell Town at the start of the 2009–2010 season, scoring on his debut in the 1–1 home draw with Boston Town on 8 August 2009.

Gosnells is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia.
The district is based in the south-eastern suburbs of Perth. It includes almost all of the suburb of Gosnells, large parts of the suburbs of Huntingdale and Thornlie and a small part of the suburb of Martin.
Politically, Gosnells appears to be a safe Labor seat. Based on the results of the 2005 state election, the district was created with a Labor Party majority of 61.5% to 38.5% versus the Liberal Party. At the next state election in 2008 the majority dropped to 55.9% with the Australian Labor Party. and 44.5% with the Liberal Party of Australia.
The upcoming state election will take place on March 9, 2012 and will see Chris Tallentire go up against new candidate for the Liberal Party of Australia, David Goode.
History.
Gosnells was first created for the 1977 state election and abolished ahead of the 1989 state election. It was largely replaced by the district of Thornlie, which sitting Gosnells MP Yvonne Henderson contested and won. Gosnells was held at all times by the Labor Party.
A new seat named Gosnells was created for the 2008 state election when the number of metropolitan seats was increased in accordance with the new one vote one value legislation. The new district was drawn from large parts of the electorates of Kenwick, which was abolished, and Southern River as well as a small part of Armadale.

Rudolph de Trafford

Sir Rudolph Edgar Francis de Trafford, 5 Baronet, OBE (31 August 1894–16 August 1983) was a British aristocrat and banker who succeeded his brother to the de Trafford baronetage at the age of 77.
Rudolph was the second son of Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 3rd Baronet and Violet Alice Maud Franklin. He attended Eton, where he was friends with Marshall Field III, and Trinity College, Cambridge. After graduating with a BA in 1915, he fought in the First World War, being twice mentioned in despatches. In 1919, Rudolph joined Marshall Field in California for a vacation with Field's wife and children on Catalina Island.
Rudolph married June Isabel Chaplin, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Reginald Chaplin (son of John Worthy Chaplin VC), at St James Church, Spanish Place, St Marylebone on 6 February 1924. The reception was held at Seaford House, which was lent to the couple by Lord and Lady Howard de Walden and they honeymooned in Egypt. Their only son, Dermot, was born on 19 January 1925.
By 1931, Rudolph was working in London for the Boston investment bank Lee, Higginson & Co., which had also employed Marshall Field III. Although the bank collapsed in the Swedish match scandal in 1932, Rudolph continued to work for reformed company. In his capacity as the senior director in Europe of Higginson and Co, he negotiated at least two unsuccessful attempts at merger with the British investment house Kleinwort Benson in 1936 and 1938.
During this period, Rudolph's marriage broke up. In 1936, he and June had leased the Loder Dower House, at Cowfold, Sussex. Then in April 1938, after 14 years of marriage, June de Trafford petitioned for divorce on the grounds of Rudolph's adultery in a London Hotel in November 1937. The case was uncontested and the courts granted June a "decree nisi" along with custody of their son. In 1952, June remarried to Thomas Touchet-Jesson and became Lady Audley. They divorced in 1957 and June died in 1977.
Rudolph also remarried, on the 2 February 1939 to Katherine 'Kay' Lo Savio Balke the daughter of W.W. Balke of Cincinnati, Ohio. He continued to work as a City of London banker, later being appointed director of the Royal Exchange. In 1971, when his elder brother Sir Humphrey de Trafford died with no male heirs, Rudolph succeeded him to the de Trafford baronetage. 
Rudolph de Trafford died on 16 August 1983, two weeks before his 89th birthday, at his home in Eaton Square, London. His requiem was celebrated at St Mary's Church, Cadogan Street. Kay de Trafford died on 15 September 1993.

Battle of Añaquito

After his unheard claims as governor of New Castile (Peru) following the death of his brother, Gonzalo Pizarro pressed claims to be recognized as the ruler of the land he and his brothers had conquered. After the arrival of appointed royal viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela in 1544, Gonzalo succeeded to have him repelled and sent to Panama in chains. He was released, however, and returned to Peru by sea while Gonzalo was mustering an army. The two met on January 18 at Añaquito in the outskirts of Quito, present-day capital of Ecuador, where the superiority of the Nueva Castilla army ensured victory for Gonzalo. Blasco Núñez Vela reportedly fought bravely but fell as a victim in battle and was later decapitated on the field of defeat, a fate Gonzalo himself would share two years later at Jaquijahuana.

USS Humboldt (AVP-21)

USS "Humboldt" (AVP-21) was a United States Navy "Barnegat"-class small seaplane tender in commission from 1941 to 1947. She was briefly reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary and redesignated AG-121 during 1945.
Construction and commissioning.
"Humboldt" (AVP-21) was laid down at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, on 6 September 1940. She was launched on 17 March 1941, sponsored by Mrs. William T. Tarrant, and commissioned on 7 October 1941 with Commander W. G. Tomkinson in command.
World War II service.
South Atlantic operations.
Following rigorous shakedown training off the United States East Coast, "Humboldt" sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 May 1942 to join Rear Admiral Jonas H. Ingrain's South Atlantic Force on the coast of Brazil. After stops at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad, she arrived at Recife, Brazil, on 5 August 1942 and began tending the seaplanes of Patrol Squadron 83 (VP-83). 
During the months that followed, these patrol aircraft, operating with ships of the Brazilian Navy and U.S. Navy, patrolled the South Atlantic Ocean sea lanes and hunted Axis submarines. "Humboldt" supplied and repaired seaplanes and, in addition, carried aviation gasoline to outlying air bases along the Brazilian coast while engaging in antisubmarine patrols herself.
President Roosevelt arrives on board.
While at Natal, Brazil, on 28 January 1943, "Humboldt" was the site of a conference between President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was returning from the Casablanca Conference, and President Getúlio Vargas of Brazil. This meeting helped to achieve even closer cooperation between the naval units of the two countries.
Continued South Atlantic operations.
After the meeting of the two presidents, "Humboldt" continued to visit isolated ports on the Brazilian coast with supplies and established a new seaplane base at Aratú, Bahia, Brazil, in May 1943.
North Atlantic operations.
"Humboldt" headed north on 1 July 1943, arriving at Boston, Massachusetts, on 17 July 1943 to take up new duties in the North Atlantic Ocean. Departing on 23 August 1943, she carried supplies and parts to U.S. Navy fleet air wings in Newfoundland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom. She continued this dangerous duty, often sailing unescorted, into the early months of 1944, occasionally sailing to Casablanca, French Morocco as well. 
"Humboldt" was at Casablanca in late May 1944 when she heard that a German submarine had torpedoed escort aircraft carrier and destroyer escort in the Atlantic, sinking "Block Island" and damaging "Barr". "Humboldt" steamed out to help with survivors and to escort "Barr" to safety.
"Humboldt" was soon underway again, this time to bring an experienced U.S. Navy submarine officer to rendezvous with escort aircraft carrier hunter-killer group, which had just captured the in an epic encounter on 4 June 1944.
"Humboldt" continued to bring supplies to aviation squadrons in the Azores and North Africa until 22 March 1945.
Return to South Atlantic service.
On 22 March 1945, "Humboldt" departed Norfolk, Virginia, for Brazil. Returning to her original seaplane tending duties in the South Atlantic, "Humboldt" arrived at Recife, Brazil, on 5 April 1945 and remained on duty until the surrender of Germany in early May 1945, after which she departed Brazil for Norfolk on 10 June 1945.
Conversion to press information ship.
"Humboldt" moved to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 16 July 1945, for conversion to a press information ship. Reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary and redesignated AG-121 on 30 July 1945, "Humboldt" was to serve as a broadcast and teletype center for correspondents during the planned invasion of Japan in 1945–1946. However, hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945, making the invasion unnecessary before her conversion was completed.
Post-World War II decommissioning.
"Humboldt" was converted back into a seaplane tender and was again designated AVP-21. She arrived at Orange, Texas, on 22 November 1945, for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 19 March 1947 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange.
United States Coast Guard service.
Loaned to the United States Coast Guard on 24 January 1949, "Humboldt" was commissioned as the cutter USCGC "Humboldt" (WAVP-372) on 29 March 1949. Based at Boston, Massachusetts, and reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated 'WHEC-372 on 1 May 1966, her primary duty was to patrol ocean stations in the North Atlantic, providing weather reporting services and engaging in search-and-rescue and law-enforcement operations. She was transferred permanently to the Coast Guard on 26 September 1966.
Final disposition.
On 30 September 1969, the Coast Guard decommissioned her and transferred her to the U.S. Navy. Stricken from the Navy List in 1970, she was sold for scrapping in May 1970 and scrapped in Italy.

Ubu and the Truth Commission

Ubu and the Truth Commission is a South African play by Jane Taylor first performed under the directorship of William Kentridge at The Laboratory in Johannesburg's Market Theatre on 26 May 1997.
Produced by the Handspring Puppet Company, and employing a multimedia approach in the tradition of Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht, it combines puppetry with live actors, music, animation and documentary footage, while also drawing extensively on Alfred Jarry's absurdist production "Ubu Roi" (1896). It fuses the chaos of the Ubu legend with original testimony from witnesses at the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
The TRC.
In her "Writer's Note" to the 2007 book-form publication of the play, Taylor wrote,
What has engaged me as I have followed the Commission, is the way in which individual narratives come to stand for the larger national narrative. The stories of personal grief, loss, triumph and violation now stand as an account of South Africa's recent past. History and autobiography merge. This marks a significant shift, because in the past decades of popular resistance, personal suffering was eclipsed — subordinated to a larger project of mass liberation. Now, however, we hear in individual testimony the very private patterns of language and thought that structure memory and mourning. "Ubu and the Truth Commission" uses these circumstances as a starting point.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in 1996 with what Taylor described as a "momentous mandate", to solicit testimony from those who considered themselves casualties, perpetrators or survivors of the apartheid atrocity. Coming almost exactly two years after South Africa's first democratic elections, the Commission's purposes, in Taylor's eyes, were "to retrieve lost histories, to make reparation to those who had suffered, to provide amnesty for acts which were demonstrably political in purpose [... and, among the most important] to create a general context through which national reconciliation might be made possible."
"The Commission itself is theatre," wrote William Kentridge, "or at any rate a kind of ur-theatre [...]. One by one witnesses come and have their half hour to tell their story, pause, weep, be comforted by professional comforters who sit at the table with them. The stories are harrowing, spellbinding. The audience sit at the edge of their seats listening to every word. This is exemplary civic theatre, a public hearing of private griefs which are absorbed into the body politic as a part of a deeper understanding of how the society arrived at its present position."
Plot.
Pa Ubu (played by Dawid Minnaar) has been spending a great deal of time away from home, much to the concern and suspicion of his wife (Busi Zokufa), who smells on him an odour which she suspects may be that of a mistress. In truth, however, he is an agent of a governmental death squad, and the odour that she smells is of blood and dynamite.
With the abolishment of apartheid, the TRC is set in motion. Amnesty is offered those war criminals who come forward and offer full and truthful testimony regarding their infractions. Ubu, suspecting a trick, is unsure of what to do. The play follows his indecisive actions as they lead his path finally to a convergence with that of the TRC.
Conception, production and performance.
Kentridge had been working for some years with the Handspring Puppet Company in Johannesburg before the idea for "Ubu and the Truth Commission" was mooted, and had extensive experience of theatre that incorporated animation, puppets and actors. He did not, he claimed, pursue the multimedia realm because of any aesthetic ideal, but rather because he was skilled in the art of animation anyway and was curious to see how it would combine with puppet theatre. "Woyzeck on the Highveld" (1993) and, more notably, "Faustus in Africa" (1996) were successful tone-setters in this respect. The latter, according to Kentridge, was "a huge undertaking", after which he and the company were on the look-out merely for something small to "do and survive". Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" seemed ideally suited to puppetry, "ut we reckoned without the Beckett fundamentalists who would not give permission for us to leave out even a comma from the stage directions". In a bid to secure a neo-Becketian text (but not having the skill to write their own), and after rejecting several ideas, they considered a project called "Waiting Room", which would comprise interviews with land-mine victims waiting in rural orthopaedic hospitals in Angola and Mozambique.
At the time, Kentridge happened to be etching a series of pieces for an exhibition in honour of the centenary of "Ubu Roi"'s opening appearance in Parisian theatre. They concerned a naked man in front of a blackboard on which were drawings of Ubu, "with his pointed head and belly spiral". Kentridge intended when the etchings were complete to animate the chalk drawings, which led him to the natural conclusion that the naked man might as well be animated, too. He asked a friend in choreography if she would care to have a dancer in front of screen on which a "schematic line drawing" of Ubu was to move about.
When Kentridge realised that he could not immerse himself in both the Ubu and the "Waiting Room" projects simultaneously, he panicked and chose to combine the two. When the TRC took off, it became clear that he need look no further in his hunt for material, for "an avalanche" was streaming in every day. While he went about convincing the two parties to come together, he formed an ever-clearer picture of how the two could complement one another. The grave documentary material from the TRC could lend to the rampant burlesque, "which always had a danger of becoming merely amusing", a certain dignity and sobriety, while the untamed liberty which characterised "Ubu Roi" could shed new light and offer a fresh and lively perspective on the depressing affairs of the TRC.
Looking at the play retrospectively, Kentridge did not feel that its shoddy provenance had maledicted it; rather it had accorded its writer, director and producers a gradually compounding platform on which they could "find pieces of the play, images, literary conceits, changing physical metaphors that we would never have arrived at if we had started from a sober beginning".
"There is," wrote Taylor of "Ubu Roi" and its main character's madness, "a particular kind of pleasure for an audience watching these infantile attacks. Part of the satisfaction arises from the fact that in the burlesque mode which Jarry invents, there is no place for consequence. While Ubu may be relentless in his political aspirations, and brutal in his personal relations, he apparently has no measurable effect upon those who inhabit the farcical world which he creates around himself. He thus acts out our most childish rages and desires, in which we seek to gratify ourselves at all cost. It is this feature in particular which has informed our own production."
Deeply affected as she viewed the TRC's proceedings by the frequency of the atrocities and the negligence and ignorance with which so many of them were carried out, Taylor noted that "those perpetrators who seem to have some capacity for remorse, appear to be shocked at observing, as if from the outside, the effect of their behaviour. Others simply show no response at all, so profound is the denial, or the failure of moral imagination." It was thus her endeavour to pluck Ubu from the world of burlesque and action without consequence, and drop him in one altogether different: "It is as if Cause and Effect are registered through different modes of expression in the play [...]."
Puppetry.
The play's conception began in earnest with a meeting between Taylor, Kentridge, Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler, who all agreed in principle to employ Ubu as a vehicle for exploring the TRC. Near the end of 1996, Taylor attended numerous workshops with the Handspring Puppet Company and grew to appreciate the actors' capacities and the style of puppet theatre. Also discussed were such transcendental devices as the three-headed hound and the embrace of various hybrid forms of animation and puppetry: drawn figures were hand-controlled and filmed on a sequential frame-by-frame basis. Taylor later confessed that her writing was greatly informed not only by Kentridge's direction but also by these experiences, and believed that her colleagues were similarly inspired and edified. 
Taylor came to see great significance in the figurative role of the puppet, for its every motion was, in essence, tropical:
The puppet draws attention to its own artifice, and we as audience willingly submit ourselves to the ambiguous processes that at once deny and assert the reality of what we watch. Puppets also declare that they are being "spoken through". They thus very poignantly and compellingly capture complex relations of testimony, translation and documentation apparent in the processes of the Commission itself.
It was early on in the workshops that the decision was taken as a finality to have Ma and Pa Ubu played by orthodox histrions. "These characters thus exist, as it were, on one scale," wrote Taylor. "The witnesses, who are represented by puppet-figures, exist on another scale, and a great deal of their meaning arises out of this fact." Lewis Segal, writing in the "Los Angeles Times", declared that the puppets incarnated "a helpless nobility in the face of great suffering", while noting that they represented only "a kind of supplement to a neo-Expressionist theatrical experience that the company defines primarily with human actors and film animation".
Testimonials.
In tackling the matter of how to portray TRC testimonials on stage, the first question was, according to Kentridge, an ethical one: "what is our responsibility to the people whose stories we are using as raw fodder for the play?" He was uncomfortable with using "real" actors for the reason of "the audience being caught halfway between having to believe in the actor for the sake of the story, and also not believe in the actor for the sake of the actual witness who existed out there but was not the actor". Using a puppet, on the other hand, would leave the audience with no reason to believe that the puppet or puppeteer represented an actual witness: "The difference between the materials of which a puppet is made and human flesh," wrote Jones and Kohler, "can break the illusion that both exist in the same moment." Kentridge confirmed that "he puppet becomes a medium through which the testimony can be heard."
Jones and Kohler, head puppeteers alongside Louis Seboko, elaborated:
Their responsibility in the play is both central and extremely onerous, as their task is to re-enact the deeply harrowing personal accounts of the effect of the former Apartheid State on people's lives. Badly handled, such stories could easily become a kind of horror pornography. The puppets assist in mediating this horror. They are not actors playing a role. Rather, they are wooden dolls attempting to be real people. As they attempt to move and breathe as we do, they cross the barrier of the here and now and become metaphors for humanity.
Each puppet was given two puppeteers, which bestowed upon it a metaphorical element of vulnerability, while also calling to mind the professional comforters who accompanied witnesses during TRC proceedings. These worked together to divide and cut down individual control over the puppet's movement and speech. "This," explained Jones and Kohler, "encourages us to enter into the illusion that the puppet has a life and responsibility of its own. But the fact that the manipulators are present also allows us to use the emotions visible in the puppeteers' faces to inform our understanding of the emotions of the puppet character, with its immobile features [...]. Puppets are brought to life by the conviction of the puppeteer and the willingness of the audience. When an actor plays opposite a puppet, she or he participates in the same process. There can be no eye contact with the puppeteer. The actor's focus is solely on the puppet itself."
The endeavour was largely successful. "The plain wooden faces of these characters -- handled with enormous skill by Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler and Louis Seboko -- confer a power and credibility on their words that real actors could never achieve," wrote crici William Triplett. "In such scenes actors will try to make you feel what their characters have witnessed. But an expressionless puppet, especially one 'speaking' the unspeakable through one of the commission's monotoned translators, engages the imagination awesomely."
The company was especially pleased with the decision to make use of witness-puppets because of the fact that the commission often had a translator to complement each testifier: "Two speakers for the same story and our puppets need two manipulators," as Kentridge put it. "One manipulator could tell the story in Zulu and the other could translate." This did not work, however, as the stories could not be heard, so the translators were placed instead in Ubu's shower, which served as a sort of booth, and difference was made between the authentic witness voice and the contrived public address of the interlingual rendition.
A significant challenge to the skills of the puppeteers (especially those controlling the witnesses) came in the form of manipulating them at the right pace, a pace usually rather more sluggish than that of a normal actor, for it was important that the audience see precisely what it was that the puppet was doing. The puppeteers worked extensively with their figures to determine this, while also settling on specific moments of physical contact between puppet and orthodox human actor.
An even greater challenge that the decision to employ witness-puppets presented was how to achieve a balance between the put-upon placidity of the witnesses and the delirious burlesque of Ma and Pa Ubu. "When the play is working at its best," wrote Kentridge, "Pa Ubu does not hold back. He tries to colonise the stage and be the sole focus of the audience. And it is the task of the actors and manipulators of the puppets to wrest that attention back. This battle is extremely delicate. If pushed too hard there is the danger of the witnesses becoming strident, pathetic, self pitying. If they retreat too far they are swamped by Ubu. But sometimes, in a good performance, and with a willing audience we do make the witnesses stories clearly heard and also throw them into a wider set of questions that Ubu engenders around them." Although the witness puppets were never to be seen by Ubu and his wife — they were situated in close spatial proximity to Ubu, behind his furniture, but made to appear elsewhere —, their actions had a direct bearing upon them.
The most important upshot of the decision was that witnesses could now show up in manifold nooks of Ubu's life, not merely (as had originally been intended) in the witness stand. It also engendered an experimental scene in which Ubu lies on a table looking up in a dream at a puppet as it testifies about its child's demise. It was tried initially with the witness behind Ubu's hips, so that his body formed a rolling landscape with a small rise from behind which the witness gave testimony. When the same scene was tried with the witness behind his head, it became evident that the best way to go would be turn the witness into a dream, and the story became Ubu's confession. Kentridge recalled,
We put the witness behind Ubu's legs again and he was back in the landscape. We then tried to see how close the puppet could get to touching Ubu without breaking the double image. Extremely close we found. And then we tried it with the witness touching Ubu's hip with its wooden hand. An extraordinary thing happened. What we saw was an act of absolution. The witness forgave, even comforted Ubu for his act. These were a series of wholly unexpected meanings, generated not through clarity of thought, or brilliance of invention, but through practical theatre work. This is the second polemic I would make. A faith in a practical epistemology in the theatre-trusting in and using the artifices and techniques of theatre to generate meaning.
The opposite was also true, however, as in his idea of a dancer before an image-bearing screen. Both the dancer and the image were to be seen together, generating an elaborate figure, but it became obvious within twenty minutes of starting the project that, "reasons of synchronisation, parallax, lighting, [and stilted performance", it was incompatible. "Next polemic - Mistrust of Good Ideas in the abstract. Mistrust of starting with a knowledge of the meaning of an image and thinking it can then be executed. There is for me more than an accidental linguistic connection between "executing" an idea and "killing" it."
Throughout the play, and specifically when Ubu feels insecure about being found out, an animated eye, intercut with a real one in classic Kentridge fashion, emerges on the screen to convey the sense that the main character is not quite so alone as he would like to think. The screen was used repeatedly and effectively in Kentridge's production. "n every instance the images are more suggestive than real," wrote Triplett, "and hence more powerful."
Allusions and symbolism.
Several of the play's marionettes carry allusions to the work of Jarry: the Palcontents of "Ubu Cocu", the protagonist's "manic acts of mayhem", find representation as lethal and destructive vices in Taylor's play with a three-headed dog.
For symbolism more in keeping with the TRC, meanwhile, Kentridge was keen on including a paper shredder. "In South Africa at the moment," he explained, "there is a battle between the paper shredders and the photostat machines. For each police general who is shredding documents of his past there are officers under him who are Photostatting them to keep as insurance against future prosecutions. A normal machine, however, did not seem especially creative, so, after abandoning representative bread-slicers (in view of the palling thought of wasted dough), animated projections (in view of Kentridge's reluctance to spend hours drawing them) and the dog's mouth (in view of its narrowness), they settled on a crocodile's mouth, to be carried as a handbag by Ubu's wife. This crocodile, then, played the role not only of Ma Ubu's handbag; it was Pa Ubu's pet advisor and cover-up man, too, concealing incriminatory evidence in his mouth .
Three puppet-types, then — the vulture, the witnesses, and Brutus the dog and Niles crocodile —, were created. It was, claimed the puppeteers, "a fairly organic process", undertaken in accordance with the play's requirements. Each puppet-type had a unique and particular affiliation with Ma and Pa Ubu. The vulture, limited in its actions, was placed near the rear of the stage, where sporadically it offered sardonic aphorisms through a series of electronically-contrived squawks that were translated on the screen behind it. "Thus," wrote the puppeteers, "it is a form of manipulation: like gears driven by motors which in turn are driven by a remote technician — which is appropriate to its function in the play — an apparently authorless automaton spewing forth programmed truisms."
The crocodile was given but one manipulator to the dog's one for each head. They moved about freely and in the same space as the human characters, rather than being restricted in the traditional playboard sense seen in such earlier plays as "Woyzeck on the Highveld". The puppeteers thought it difficult, though, to conceive of their being represented by human characters.
Brutus, who speaks in verse, fills the role of Ubu's vicious henchman, stealing away with him to carry out atrocities: "Their culpability is indivisible." Each of its heads had its own character: one was a foot soldier, the other a general and the last a politician. The body was created out of an old briefcase given Sir Sydney Kentridge (William's activist-lawyer father) by Braam Fischer. Similarly, the crocodile's belly was a canvas kit bag previously the possession of Basil Jones's father during military service in North Africa. The scheme of using bags for bodies served to provide a suitable of place of hiding for Ubu, an easy place of discovery for his wife and an ideal place for Ubu to plant incriminatory evidence by which he could distance himself from their crimes.
Rather uniquely, "Ubu and the Truth Commission" allowed its puppeteers free and undisguised reign over the stage, and took advantage of the potential for interaction between them and their puppets. It was agreed early on in the play's conception that the TRC witnesses would be represented by puppets with their speaking manipulators visible next to them, for that was almost always the case with Handspring. "When [...] Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler and Louis Seboko hold the hands of the puppet characters in some of the most intense moments of 'Ubu and the Truth Commission,'" wrote Segal, "it seems as much an act of consolation as the method by which the large, carved doll-figures are made to gesture."
The play retains a great deal of its ancestor's scatology, opening, for example, with the word "Pschitt!", whose French equivalent, "Merdre!", invoked a riot at Jarry's premier in 1896. "'Ubu and the Truth Commission' dramatizes the politics of betrayal so graphically," opined Segal, "that it eminently deserves its adults-only designation."
Protagonist.
Of her main character and his role in the play, Taylor writes,
Ubu's story is, at one level, a singular story of individual pathology; yet it is at the same time an exemplary account of the relationships between capitalist ideology, imperialism, race, class, and gender, religion and modernisation in the southern African sub-region.
Nevertheless, Ubu retains in this play the antihero status first accorded him in Jarry's: he is a greedy, sadistic, homicidal, esurient, licentious apartheid police officer. Set against the TRC, "agent is thus, in a sense, an agent of evil." Taylor justifies this with literary precedents like "Paradise Lost", where John Milton, in William Blake's famous phrase, finds himself "of the Devils party", her belief that "[narrative depends on agency; the stories of those who 'do' are generally more compelling than those who are 'done to'", and the nature of the TRC itself, which cast the victims as protagonists and gave little emphasis to other players.
There was also, according to Taylor, another reason: "he provoked us. He is familiar but wholly foreign, he is both human and inhuman. He is the limit term which was used to keep an entire system of meaning in place, from its most extreme to its most banal." "You may not sympathize with the character," wrote Triplett, "but in the end you don't hate him either; instead you are left with the feeling that reconciliation just might be possible."
Although the play appropriates Jarry's agonist to the context of the TRC, it retains his archaic language and original slang, anachronising him as "a figure who lives within a world of remote forms and meanings". Ubu does not represent any particular figure in South African history; rather, he is "an aspect, a tendency, an excuse". Often, though, he speaks in voices reminiscent of those sounded at the TRC, his language set against its languages. As Taylor observes,
The archaic and artificial language which Ubu uses, with its rhymes, its puns, its bombast and its profanities, is set against the detailed and careful descriptions of the witness accounts which have been, in large measure, transcribed from TRC hearings. Ubu is confronted within his own home by those whom he has assaulted.
It is the structure of the play, according to its writer, merging Ubu legend with the ongoing Truth Commission, that gives it its meaning, with patent theatrical consequences:
Perhaps most evidently, we are automatically taking on the burden of the farcical genre which Jarry used. I remember having lengthy debates, with a student, about the ethics of Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator", and whether one could ever explore human rights abuses through a burlesque idiom. My responses now are perhaps more complex than they were then.
Taylor also noted that, in modern times of vast informational overloading, it was difficult always to respond, as expected, "with outrage, sympathy, or wonder, within a context that inculcates bewilderment and dislocation." Her play, then, sought to reproduce the ambiguous nature of response to suffering:
Our own reactions are questioned, because, after all, what is it in us that makes us seek out the stories of another's grief? Or, even more problematically, what makes us follow the stories of the torturers? We follow Ubu's history, are drawn into his family drama, are confronted with his logics of self-justification. We as audience are also implicated because we laugh at his sometimes absurd antics, and this very laughter accuses us.
While its focus is obviously South African, its application, according to Taylor, is broad in scope: "We in the late twentieth century live in an era of singular attention to questions of war crimes, reparations, global 'peace-keeping'. We are, it seems, increasingly aware of the obligation to hear testimony, even while we may yet be determining how to act upon what we have heard." Segal agreed:
Although the work should be a jolt for many Africa-watchers — offering a portrait of post-apartheid Mandela-land as anything but the best of all possible worlds — its key issues resonate far from that continent. Like Americans during the Clinton scandals, for instance, Mrs. Ubu (Busi Zokufa) fixates on accusations of sexual excess, not imagining that her lord and master might be committing bigger crimes; when she learns the truth, she immediately turns those crimes into media gold.
Reception.
In South African circles, the play was well received. "The Star" dubbed it a "multi-dimensional theatre piece which tries to make sense of the madness which overtook South Africa during apartheid", while Mark Gevisser predicted in "The Sunday Independent" that it "will be for post-apartheid theatre what "Woza Albert" was for protest theatre: a touchstone of artful, affecting political engagement".
In Los Angeles, Segal was all praise: "Director and animator William Kentridge skillfully integrates the movement of actors and puppets with his often startling animated chalk-drawings and live-action imagery projected at the back of the stage. 'Ubu' may be unrelievedly depressing, but it is executed with consummate artistry."
In "The Washington Post", after viewing the play during a "regrettably brief" run of four performances at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, William Triplett described it to readers as a "stunningly theatrical multimedia piece that drives home the atrocity known as apartheid without ever uttering the words 'atrocity' or 'apartheid' or any like them. By turns chilling and hilarious, brutal and forgiving, the show casts a surreal light on the heart of darkness — and still manages to leave you with hope [...]. 'Ubu' is one of those rarities, a piece of political theater that transcends politics. Its truth is human, but you can hear it only from the mouths of puppets."
It was widely agreed that Dawid Minnaar and Busi Zokufa gave fair and accurate portrayals of Taylor's Ubus. "Minnaar and Zokufa give performances that are wonderfully alive in this tale of death and redemption," wrote Triplett. "Minnaar deserves a special ovation, since Taylor didn't write Pa Ubu as a monster, and Minnaar doesn't play him as one [...].
General production values, too, were lauded: "The dynamic sound, by Wilbert Schubel, is as complex as the entire range of emotions spanned by the show. Wesley France's lighting sometimes sweeps the bare stage, and other times pinpoints a small area, expanding and contracting focus when necessary."
After one performance, a Romanian woman, deeply moved by what she had seen, approached the cast to congratulate it. Surprise was expressed that a play of such local context could have been accessible to her. "That's it," she explained. "It is so local. So local. This play is written about Romania."
Publication.
"Ubu and the Truth Commission" was first published in book-form in 1998 by the University of Cape Town Press and has since undergone three reprints. They include the full playscript, notes by the writer, director and puppeteers, photographs from Kentridge's production, drawings and archive imagery.

<doc id="18848008" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18848008" title="Agolant">
Agolant

Agolant or Agolante is a fictional character in Medieval and Renaissance romantic epics dealing with the Matter of France, including "Orlando innamorato" by Matteo Maria Boiardo and "Orlando furioso" by Ludovico Ariosto. He is a Saracen king from Africa.
The character appears in the "Historia Caroli Magni", sometimes known as the "Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle", a 12th-century Latin forged chronicle of legendary material about Charlemagne's alleged conquest of Spain. In this text, Agolant, briefly, reconquers Spain from Charlemagne. In the subsequent war, several miracles occur, including flowers sprouting from the lances of the knights. Another war has Agolant invading south-western France and sieging the city of Agen, but he is forced to retreat to Pamplona. In a last war, Charlemagne's great army sieges Pampeluna. After the death of Agolant, Charlemagne's troops pursue the Saracens through Spain.
Agolant is a central character in the late 12th century Old French "chanson de geste" "Aspremont" (before 1190). In this tale, Agolant and his son Helmont invade Calabria. In the end, they are defeated at Aspromonte by a youthful Roland, and in gratitude, Charlemagne gives Roland Helmont's horse (Veillantif) and sword (Durandal). Versions of this "chanson" were extremely popular in England, Italy (see the adaptation by Andrea da Barberino) and even Scandinavia.
Agolant appears in Jean Bagnyon's 15th century "La Conqueste du grand roy Charlemagne des Espagnes et les vaillances des douze pairs de France, et aussi celles de Fierabras" (book 3, part 1, chapters 4-5), a work largely based on the "Historia Caroli Magni", probably known to Bagnyon via the "Speculum Historiale" of Vincent de Beauvais.
Through this tradition, Agolant(e) appears in the Italian romantic epics. In "Orlando innamorato" by Matteo Maria Boiardo and in "Orlando furioso" by Ludovico Ariosto, he is the father of Almonte and Troiano and his daughter, Galaciella, is the mother of Ruggiero III and (in Ariosto) Marfisa. In both, Agolant's son Almonte is killed at Aspromonte by a youthful Orlando, who takes his helmet (in Boiardo, Agolant's helmet was received from the wizard Albrizach.), his sword Durindana (which had belonged to the Greek hero Hector; the defeated Ruggerio II, father of Ruggerio III, was a descendant of Astyanax, son of Hector) and horse (Brigliadoro). Agolant is also mentioned in Luigi Pulci's "Morgante".

USCGC Humboldt (WAVP-372)

USCGC "Humboldt" (WAVP-372), later WHEC-372, was a "Casco"-class United States Coast Guard Cutter in service from 1949 to 1969.
Construction and U.S. Navy service.
"Humboldt" began life as the United States Navy "Barnegat"-class seaplane tender USS "Humboldt" (AVP-21). She was laid down on 6 September 1940 by the Boston Navy Yard at Boston, Massachusetts, and launched on 17 March 1941. She commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 7 October 1941. She operated in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea during World War II. She began conversion for use a press information ship in 1945 in anticipation of the invasion of Japan, but was converted back into a seaplane tender when the war ended without the invasion being necessary. She was decommissioned on 19 March 1947 and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange, Texas.
Transferred to the United States Coast Guard.
"Barnegat"-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed.
"Humboldt" was loaned to the Coast Guard at 24 January 1949. After undergoing conversion for use as a weather-reporting ship, she was commissioned into Coast Guard service as USCGC "Humboldt" (WAVP-372) on 29 March 1949.
During her Coast Guard career, "Humboldt"s primary duty was to serve on ocean stations in the Atlantic Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and performed law enforcement operations.
U.S. Coast Guard service.
"Humboldt" was stationed at Boston, Massachusetts, from 29 March 1949 to September 1966. She was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-372 on 1 May 1966. On 26 September 1966, her long-term loan from the Navy to the Coast Guard came to an end when she was transferred outright to the Coast Guard.
In September 1966, "Humboldt" shifted her home port to Portland, Maine. On 29 October 1968, she rescued the crew from the sailing ship "Atlantic II".
Decommissioning and disposal.
"Humboldt" was decommissioned on 30 September 1969 and transferred to the U.S. Navy. She was struck from the Naval Register in 1970 and sold for scrap to Cantieri Navali, Genoa, Italy, for a bid amount of $60,000 (USD).

Die Feuerzangenbowle (1944 film)

Plot.
The title refers to the "" punch consumed by a group of gentlemen in the opening scene. While exchanging nostalgic stories about their schooldays, the successful young writer Dr. Johannes Pfeiffer realizes he missed out on something because he was taught at home and never attended school. He decides to make up for it by masquerading as a student at a small town high school and quickly gains a reputation as a prankster. Together with his classmates, he torments his professors Crey, Bömmel and Headmaster Knauer with adolescent mischief. His girlfriend Marion unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give up his foolish charade. Eventually, he falls in love with the headmaster’s daughter and discloses his identity after provoking the teachers into expelling him from school.
Film production and release.
"" was produced by Ufa Studios in Potsdam-Babelsberg. Filming was drawn out by shooting scenes to perfection to save the younger actors from being drafted into the war. Nevertheless, by the time the film was released, the German army had suffered massive casualties and some of the actors had been killed on the battlefield despite these efforts.
The film's release was in question when Bernhard Rust, secretary of education and former high school teacher, bristled at the way the movie poked fun at teachers. To circumvent a ban by the censorship board, producer Heinz Rühmann presented the film to Hermann Göring at the "Führerhauptquartier" where it proved to be a success, thus affecting its delayed release on February 28, 1944 in Berlin.
Historic context and criticism.
The transformation of the accomplished writer back to a not-so-innocent schoolboy is an example of the cheerful escapism popular in German films at the end of World War II. In 1942, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels had called for the production of predominantly entertaining films in Germany to distract the population from the political and moral debacle of the war.
The charm of the teachers in the film lies in their old-fashioned attitudes and individual quirks. As representatives of an older, non-fascist generation, they were a nostalgic reminder of a lost past to the wartime generation in Germany. The film ridicules and at the same time celebrates this lost individuality through parody.
Characters.
Hans Pfeiffer.
Dr. Johannes Pfeiffer is an accomplished playwright in Berlin who never attended regular school as he was educated at home. His friends' nostalgic recollections of their schooldays convince him that he missed out on something and he decides to go undercover as a gymnasium student in the fictional small town Babenberg. He introduces himself as Hans Pfeiffer "with three F – one before and two after the "" and quickly gets into the habit of playing elaborate practical jokes on his teachers.
The teachers.
The teachers in the story are stereotypic parodies of different teaching styles. Professors Bömmel and Crey represent liberal and democratic teaching styles respectively, but neither has much luck in gaining the students’ respect. This feat is reserved for teacher Dr. Brett who does not appear in the book but was added to the 1944 movie to represent the authoritarian style popularized at the time. The teachers' exaggerated individual quirks and particularly their dialects set them up to be easy targets for imitation and ridicule by the students. Some have acquired nicknames based on their looks. Headmaster Knauer, for example, is known as "Zeus" among the students, whereas Professor Crey is referred to as "Schnauz" (Moustache).
The women.
Two women play central roles in the story and Pfeiffer’s life. Pfeiffer’s lover Marion is a modern and self-assured "big city girl." She travels to Babenberg to try to convince Pfeiffer of the foolishness of his actions and bring him back to Berlin. Pfeiffer declines and she threatens to blow his cover. This makes her the "bad girl" of the story in accordance with the ideologies of the times reproving emancipated and "sinful" women like Marion. She eventually loses Pfeiffer when he falls in love with innocent blonde Eva, Headmaster Knauer’s daughter, who embodies the ideal image of a proper "girl next door."
Cult film status.
Since the 1980s, the film has gained cult film status at many German universities. During party-like showings in university auditoriums in early December, students bring props to participate in the movie’s action similar to audience participation in showings of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". For example, the audience will ring alarm-clocks whenever an alarm-clock rings in the movie and use flashlights when Hans Pfeiffer uses a pocket mirror to pinpoint the location of the Goths on a map behind the teacher in order to help a fellow student in history class. In 2006, more than 10,000 students participated in this tradition in Göttingen alone.

Oban

Oban (; "An t-Òban" in Scottish Gaelic meaning "The Little Bay") is a resort town within the Argyll and Bute council area of Scotland. Despite its small size, it is the largest town between Helensburgh and Fort William and during the tourist season the town can play host to up to 25,000 people. Oban occupies a beautiful setting in the Firth of Lorn. The bay is a near perfect horseshoe, protected by the island of Kerrera, and beyond Kerrera the Isle of Mull. To the north is the long low island of Lismore, and the mountains of Morvern and Ardgour.
History.
The site where Oban now stands has been used by humans since at least mesolithic times, as evidenced by archaeological remains of cave dwellers found in the town. Just outside the town stands Dunollie Castle, on a site that overlooks the main entrance to the bay and has been fortified since the Bronze age. Prior to the 19th century, the town itself supported very few households, sustaining only minor fishing, trading, shipbuilding and quarrying industries, and a few hardy tourists. The Renfrew trading company established a storehouse there in about 1714 as a local outlet for its merchandise, but no Custom-house was deemed necessary until around 1760.
The modern town of Oban grew up around the distillery which was founded there in 1794, and the town was raised to a burgh of barony in 1811 by royal charter. Sir Walter Scott visited the area in 1814, the year in which he published his poem The Lord of the Isles, and interest in the poem brought many new visitors to the town. The arrival of the railways in the 1880s brought further prosperity, revitalising local industry and giving new energy to tourism. Shortly thereafter McCaig's Tower, a folly and prominent local landmark, was constructed, as well as the ill-fated Oban Hydro.
During World War II, Oban was used by Merchant and Royal Navy ships and was an important base in the Battle of the Atlantic. The Royal Navy had a signal station near Ganavan, and an anti-submarine indicator loop station which detected any surface or submarine vessels between Oban, Mull and Lismore. There was a controlled minefield in the Sound of Kerrera which was operated from a building near the caravan site at Gallanach. There was also a Royal Air Force flying boat base at Ganavan and on Kerrera, and an airfield at North Connel built by the Royal Air Force. A Sector Operations Room was built near the airfield, and after the war this was extended to become the Royal Observer Corps Group HQ.
Oban was also important during the Cold War because the first Transatlantic Telephone Cable (TAT-1) came ashore at Gallanach Bay. This carried the Hot Line between the US and USSR presidents.
Since the 1950s the principal industry has remained tourism, though the town is also an important ferry port, acting as the hub for ferries to many of the Hebrides.
Culture.
The local culture is gaelic, and a survey in 2006 showed that some 9.4% of the population of the town could speak some Scottish Gaelic. Oban is considered the home of the Royal National Mod since it was first held there in 1892, with ten competitors on a Saturday afternoon. The town hosted the centenary Mod in 1992 (the year it became Royal) and in 2003 the 100th Mod, the two events attracting thousands of competitors and visitors (the 100th Mod was later than the centenary because it was not held in the war years). The Mod is held in Oban roughly every 6–8 years, and is next due in 2015.
An annual Highland Games, known as the Argyllshire Gathering, is also held in the town.
The Corran Halls theatre acts as a venue for community events, local and touring entertainers, and touring companies such as Scottish Opera.
The town had a two-screen cinema which was closed in early 2010. Thanks to a local community initiative, and supported by a number of famous names, it was reopened in August 2012 as the Phoenix Cinema. Oban has itself been used as a backdrop to several films including "Ring of Bright Water" and "Morvern Callar".
The Oban War and Peace Museum advances the education of present and future generations by collecting, maintaining, conserving and exhibiting items of historical and cultural interest relating to the Oban area in peacetime and during the war years. A museum also operates within Oban Distillery, just behind the main seafront. The distillation of whisky in Oban predates the town: whisky has been produced on the site since 1794. The Hope MacDougall collection is a unique record of the working and domestic lives of people in Scotland.
Music is central to Gaelic culture, and there is lively interest in the town. In the 2010 Pipe Band season, the local Oban High School Pipe Band, led by piping legend Angus MacColl, were successful in winning the World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow, the Cowal Games competition, and the Champion of Champions for the year in the novice-juvenile grade. The town also boasts a successful senior pipe band. The local Gaelic choir competes regularly and successfully in the Mod.
During the 2011 Guy Fawkes Night, Oban became briefly infamous for its fireworks display, which became a worldwide news and online hit when £6,000 of display fireworks were ignited all at once due to a computer error. The display, which was due to last 20–30 minutes, was over in less than a minute. Pyro1, the company putting on the display, later said sorry to the town by providing a free fireworks show.
The town has been the birthplace and home of a number of well known people.
Local attractions.
The area around Oban is rich with attractions for tourists, from the dramatic scenery of the coast and mountains to the fascinating histories of the local castles and ancient religious sites. There are also many activities available for families and those interested in more active pursuits. The Oban and Lorn tourist information website has detailed information for visitors.
The Oban Visitor Information Centre, operated by VisitScotland, is located in the Columba Buildings on the North Pier.
Sport.
The local amateur football team is Oban Saints with a small stadium situated in Mossfield. However, shinty is a more popular game locally, with two major teams, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic, in the town. The "Oban Times" runs a "Spot the Shinty Ball" competition each week. Oban Cricket Club was formed in 2003 and plays in nearby Taynuilt. Oban Lorne Rugby Football Club turned 50 years old in 2012, and competes in the RBS West region. The Highlanders were a World Wrestling Entertainment wrestling tag-team originally from Oban.
Watersports are an obvious activity in a seaport, and sailing is very popular. West Highland Week brings sailors from around the world to the town every year.
Scuba diving is also readily available. There are many dive operators running services in and around the area. The wreck diving is spectacular, with the Sound of Mull offering some truly world-class dive sites. Although weather and visibility can be variable, the local geography means that a dive somewhere can always be achieved.
Oban golf course was designed by professional golfer James Braid in the early 1900's, and offers a challenging 18 holes across difficult terrain.
The West Highland Tennis Championships are held annually in July and attract some of Scotland's best players to the town. Past champions include Colin Fleming and Judy Murray.
Oban also has a thriving martial arts training facility, the dojo offering Kyokushin karate, kick boxing, MMA, Shukokai karate and boxing classes.
Schools.
Oban has a primary school campus located in the south of the town along with Park Primary School at the north of the town, and a major high school, Oban High School. Secondary school pupils are drawn from a wide surrounding catchment area, with some pupils having long commutes to and from school every day.
Churches.
Oban is served by Kilmore & Oban Parish Church of the Church of Scotland. [http://obanchurch.com/index.html] There are three church buildings in the united parish, namely at Glencruitten Road and the white church (opened in 1957) at Corran Esplanade in the town, as well as Kilmore Church. The minister (since 2007) is the Rev. Dugald Cameron, who formerly served at St. John's Renfield Church, Glasgow.
The mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles is St Columba's Cathedral at the north end of the Esplanade. During the 19th century, the Rector of the Pro-Cathedral was Father Allan MacDonald, a poet and Gaelic scholar. The present cathedral was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and constructed between 1932 and 1959.
The Scottish Episcopal Church is represented in Oban by the Cathedral Church of St John the Divine, situated in George Street. It is one of two cathedrals of the united Diocese of Argyll and the Isles, the other being the Cathedral of the Isles in Millport, Isle of Cumbrae.
There are several other churches in the town, including the Free Church of Scotland in Rockfield Road, the Baptist Church in Albany Street, Salvation Army in Stevenson Street, Elim Pentecostal Church in Soroba Road, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Lorn Christian Fellowship (Independent) both of whom meet at Oban High School and the Associated Presbyterian Church in Campbell Street. The Congregational Church in Tweedale Street was built in 1880.[http://www.lochgilphead.org/CongregationalChurchOban/index.html]
A Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses is located nearby at 57 Lorn Road.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kingdom_Hall_of_Jehovah's_Witnesses_-_Dunbeg_-_geograph.org.uk_-_123368.jpg]
Climate.
As with the rest of the British Isles, Oban experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is Dunstaffnage, about 2.7 miles north-north east of Oban town centre. Rainfall is high, but thanks to the Gulf stream the temperature seldom falls below zero.
Transport.
Oban lies at the western end of the A85 road. It also has a railway station where a number of First ScotRail services operate to and from Glasgow Queen Street daily. The town is also an important ferry port, being Caledonian MacBrayne's busiest terminal. Oban is known as the "Gateway to the Isles", with ferries sailing to the islands of Lismore, Colonsay, Islay, Coll, Tiree, to Craignure on Mull, to Castlebay on Barra and to Lochboisdale on South Uist. In 2005 a new ferry terminal was opened, and in 2007 a second link span opened, allowing two vessels to load/unload at the same time.
Scottish Citylink operate services from Glasgow's Buchanan bus station several times a day, during the summer a service from Dundee via Perth (Service 973) and another to Edinburgh via Stirling (service 978) is also operated.
West Coast Motors operate many local services and also coach links as far south as Lochgilphead and as far north as Fort William.
Oban is also reachable by air via Oban Airport, some 6 miles north of the town. The airport is currently being upgraded (costing some £4.2 million), so commercial aircraft can operate life-line island services, using Oban as a hub.
In 2007 a further airlink was created between Oban and west-central Scotland with a seaplane service making it possible to fly from Glasgow city centre's Seaplane Terminal off the Clyde into the bay in Oban.
Town twinning.
Oban is twinned with Laurinburg, North Carolina (United States) and with Gorey, County Wexford, in Ireland.

Stubb Drainage Windmill

Stubb Drainage Windmill is 1.9 miles east of Hickling in the English county of Norfolk. The Windmill is a Grade II listed building and was given this status on 30 September 1987. The estimate is that there were once about 200 wind powered drainage windmills in the Broadlands. Stubb Drainage windmill is listed as one that is at risk of decay by Norfolk County Council. The structure is a Grade II listed building.
History.
Stubb Windmill is a towermill which was built between the years 1795 and 1825 along with several other drainage windmills by Sir George Berney Brograve. Water discharged from Stubb mill flowed into Meadow dyke vie drains that were also constructed at the time, one of which is called the Commissioners drain. This work resulted in the loss of three small broads which were called Wigg’s, Gag’s and Hare Park Broads.

FishCAT

In computing, FishCAT is Community Acceptance Testing program for GlassFish Application Server project by Sun Microsystems for the Java EE platform.
Introduction.
FishCAT is a GlassFish Community Acceptance Testing program. GlassFish is an open source application server project led by Sun Microsystems for the Java EE platform. The main goal of this program is to provide the opportunity for the community to significantly influence the quality of GlassFish as well as to get early feedback on stability and usability through community involvement in the GlassFish Beta testing cycle. This new phase of FishCAT will "reward" testers very closely by a clearly defined point system. On every new phase of FishCAT the points will be set to zero, so every tester is on a level playing field.
Benefits.
There are many benefits to participate in this program. Just to name a few:
Current happenings.
GlassFish 3.0 and GlassFish 3.0.1 have been released. The traditional FishCAT testing will begin on 1 October 2010 for GlassFish 3.1
History.
The project was first announced on July 31, 2008 on the quality (at) glassfish.dev.java.net mailing list and the first version of the project commenced from August 18, 2008 for 4 weeks.

Unsolved Crimes

Unsolved Crimes is an adventure video game for Nintendo DS, developed by Now Production and published by Empire Interactive.
Plot.
The game is set in New York City. The player is a rookie detective from the homicide division. There are eight cases in the game, and one larger case divided into sections. In this case, a model named Betsy Blake goes missing. She is the sister of the player's partner, Marcy Blake.
The DS offers a variety of things on the touch screen. Memos, evidence, profiles of suspects and movements are done through the touch screen.
In almost every case players must answer queries. These are often multiple-choice. If the player answers wrong they lose confidence from their partner. The game is over when Marcy loses trust in them completely, or when all cases are solved.
In one case, some queries can be skipped. However, all queries must be answered to unlock a case after the player finds Betsy.
Reception.
"Unsolved Crimes" has received a mixed critical reception. IGN called it "a solid graphic adventure with some unfortunate blemishes", praising the "variety of game mechanics" and calling the cases "genuinely engrossing", while criticising the presentation and graphics.

Seine River (Manitoba)

The Seine River is a tributary of the Red River of the North that runs through southeastern Manitoba, Canada. It is one of the four rivers of the city of Winnipeg.
Named after the well-known Seine River in France, the river rises in the Sandilands Provincial Forest near Steinbach and passes by or through the communities of Marchand, La Broquerie, Ste. Anne, and Lorette before reaching the Red River Floodway near the Winnipeg city limits. At this point the river's channel is diverted under the Floodway into what is known as the "Seine River Siphon", which allows a flow of up to 4.5 cubic metres per second; any additional flow is diverted onto the Floodway. During a wet spring, the river often overflows its banks, sometimes flooding nearby houses. During a dry summer, the river is often reduced to a trickle.
Within the city, the Seine travels a tortuously meandering course, reaching the Red River at St. Boniface just north of The Forks. The lower section of its course in the city marks the east-west boundary between the southern section of St. Boniface and the suburb of St. Vital.
It is a typical meandering river with a single main channel embanked within a flat, shallow valley. The river's banks are heavily treed, but pollution has been an issue in the city of Winnipeg.

Stewart Sapphire

The Stewart Sapphire (sometimes known as the Stuart Sapphire) is a historical sapphire that forms part of the British Crown Jewels. Its name originates from the Scottish House of Stewart.
Its original owner is traditionally King Alexander II of Scotland. The sapphire was set into his crown for his coronation in 1214. In 1296 Edward I of England claimed the sapphire along with the Stone of Scone during his attacks on Scotland.
In 1838 Queen Victoria had the jewel set into the new Imperial State Crown, at the front, below the Black Prince's Ruby. George VI had a new Imperial State Crown made, almost identical to the old one. The Stewart Sapphire was set in the new crown. Upon the acquisition of the Cullinan diamonds, the Stewart Sapphire was moved to the rear of the crown to make space for the cushion-shaped Cullinan II. Even though the sapphire is extraordinarily large, it is more of historical than monetary value. The sapphire was drilled so that it might be worn in a pendant.

<doc id="18848175" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18848175" title="Midi Mafia">
Midi Mafia

Midi Mafia is a music production duo consisting of American Bruce Waynne (born Waynne Nugent) from Brooklyn, New York and Canadian Dirty Swift (born Kevin Risto) from Ottawa, Ontario. Together as Midi Mafia since 2003, they are most notable for their production of 50 Cent's number-one single "21 Questions".
Beginnings.
Bruce Waynne met Dirty Swift at Makin' Records Studio in Brooklyn, NY, while working on a project for Bad Seed. At the time, Swift was the in house engineer/beat maker for project, while Bruce pitched beats and helped compose and perform choruses for Bad Seed.
The duo officially began working together after attending a meeting with manager Tony Perez, who suggested that Bruce and Swift would make a good musical team. They began to hold meetings with different A&R representatives and did spec work for various people, including Sylvia Rhone, who was the president of Elektra Records at the time.
Initial success.
In 2002 Dino Devalie, who was preparing to sign 50 Cent to his label, approached Midi Mafia about using some of their beats for 50 Cent’s debut record, "Get Rich or Die Tryin. Midi Mafia agreed, and though 50 Cent ended up signing to Interscope Records instead, their beats were used for the song "21 Questions", which was featured on "Get Rich or Die Tryin.
After the success of "21 Questions", Midi Mafia signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV and a label and production deal with Elektra Records. They were also offered A&R positions at Elektra and were being groomed to run Black Music.
In 2006, Midi Mafia launched FamilyTies, an imprint label that allows them to sign and develop their own roster of talent. Singer/songwriter Deemi was the first artist signed to their label.
Midi Mafia introduced themselves in to the Pop/R&B world when they produced "When I See U", (song originally written for Tori Kelly when she was signed to Geffen Records) the second single from Fantasia Barrino's self-titled album "Fantasia" which held the number one spot for eight weeks on the U.S. Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The song was written by Grammy award-winning songwriter Jane’t Sewell (which Midi Mafia discovered and developed), Bruce Waynne, and Erika Nuri.
In 2007, the duo worked with Jennifer Lopez on her track "Hold It Don't Drop It", contributing as both writers and producers.
Relocation to Los Angeles.
In 2008, Midi Mafia moved from New York to Los Angeles. After their relocation, Midi collaborated with "American Idol" contestant David Archuleta, contributing a track on his self-titled debut album, released in November 2008.
In the process of working with Brandy and James Fauntleroy II, Midi Mafia met and began to work with Frank Ocean, whom at the time went by the name Lonny Breaux. Then, Frank was working as a lyricist, and approached Midi Mafia with a desire to become better at composing melodies.
While with Midi Mafia, Frank Ocean wrote the songs “Quickly” for John Legend, “Bigger” and “Mamma’s Boy” for Justin Bieber. In 2010, Midi Mafia recorded Frank Ocean’s mix tape, Nostalgia Ultra, in which Midi Mafia produced the song Swim Good. The mixtape was recorded by Midi Mafia engineer, Reggie Rojo Jr.
Midi Mafia also collaborated with Frank Ocean as writers on the track "Bad Religion", off Ocean’s debut album, "Channel Orange".
Branding.
In November 2009, "PHamous", a hip house song they wrote and produced, was used as a backing track for a flash mob at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. The flash mob was conceived by YouTuber ShayCarl, who was assisted by fellow YouTubers LisaNova, MysteryGuitarMan, KassemG, Denise Vlogs, TimothyDeLaGhetto2 and HiimRawn. The flashmob video reached two million views within in 5 days of its release.
Within the first 20 minutes of the song being posted for download on the Internet, 450,000 people downloaded the song, causing Midi Mafia’s website to crash.
"PHamous" was used in promos for VH1 television programs and it was also used as the ending song for the weekly video of "What da Faq Show" which airs on YouTube and Facebook.
On July 16, 2010, the video for "PHamous" debuted on YouTube on TheStation channel, a collaboration channel of most of the YouTubers of the original flash mob, including the lyric about being "friends with ShayCarl." The song was also featured on the "We Killed the Radio Star Podcast" as the introductory and concluding piece of music during the episode "Don't Drink the Water".
"Vegas Lights".
On June 1, 2010, Midi Mafia released their own album, "Vegas Lights", via FamilyTies. The songs "PHamous", "Last Call" and "2 Piece" were included on the album. 
These three songs were also featured on Season 3 of the MTV show, "Jersey Shore".
The song "Lucky Tonight" was featured on "Jersey Shore vs American Reunion", an MTV video used to cross-promote the new season of "Jersey Shore" and the release of the movie, "American Reunion".
"Get Connected".
In the beginning of 2012, Midi Mafia released "Get Connected", an EDM album. Midi Mafia used the project to re-launch their brand.
A remix of their song "Blinded By The Lights" off of "Get Connected" was used in a promotional trailer for Pauly D’s show, "The Pauly D Project".
Additional artists.
On July 27, 2012, Conor Maynard released his debut album "Contrast" featuring the Midi Mafia produced "Pictures".
Midi Mafia also remixed Josh Osho's "Giants" featuring Childish Gambino which was included on Osho's album "L.I.F.E".

Tweet and Sour is a "Looney Tunes" cartoon animated short starring Tweety and Sylvester. Released March 24, 1956, the cartoon is directed by Friz Freleng. The voices are performed by Mel Blanc and June Foray.
The cartoon's title is a play on the phrase "sweet and sour".
Plot.
Granny leaves the house for an outing, but as she drives by the house and waves goodbye to Tweety, she sees Sylvester has gotten into the house and is about to eat the bird. Granny stops the cat in time and, fed up with his constant chasing after Tweety, gives him an ultimatum: "If there's so much as one little feather harmed on the canary, it's off to the violin string factory!" (punctuating the warning by mimicking Frédéric Chopin's "The Funeral March").
As Sylvester sulks in the corner, Tweety is about to face a new threat—a rough-looking orange cat wearing an eyepatch. The unnamed orange cat is after a meal of his own and is uncaring that Sylvester will be deemed responsible if Tweety is noticed missing. As such, the chase now casts Sylvester not as the predator but as the (not-so-altrustic) protagonist who plans to save Tweety from a predatory cat before Granny returns—more to save his own skin. After several exchanges, with both Sylvester and the orange cat clobbering each other, Sylvester finally gets rid of the predatory cat by blowing him up in Granny's chimney (by way of a lighted TNT candle tied to a balloon).
However, Sylvester's efforts are in vain. As he is putting Tweety "back" in the cage, Granny enters and, assuming he was after Tweety, promises to make good on her earlier threat. Sylvester tried to explain what really happened before declaring: "Aw, what's the use! She'll never believe me!", then he plays Chopin on his violin and falls into the violin case as a coffin to his doom.

ExxonMobil

Exxon Mobil Corp., or ExxonMobil, is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas, United States. It is a direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil company, and was formed on November 30, 1999, by the merger of Exxon and Mobil (formerly Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York). It is affiliated with Imperial Oil which operates in Canada. The company's largest shareholder is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The world's third largest company by revenue, ExxonMobil is also the second largest publicly traded company by market capitalization. The company was ranked No. 5 globally in Forbes Global 2000 list in 2013. ExxonMobil's reserves were 72 billion BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) at the end of 2007 and, at then (2007) rates of production, were expected to last more than 14 years. With 37 oil refineries in 21 countries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of , ExxonMobil is the largest refiner in the world, a title that was also associated with Standard Oil since its incorporation in 1870.
ExxonMobil is the largest of the world's supermajors with daily production of 3.921 million BOE. In 2008, this was approximately 3 percent of world production, which is less than several of the largest state-owned petroleum companies. When ranked by oil and gas reserves, it is 14th in the world—with less than 1 percent of the total.
ExxonMobil has been subject to numerous criticisms, including the lack of speed during its cleanup efforts after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, widely considered the number one spill worldwide in terms of damage to the environment. ExxonMobil has drawn criticism for funding organizations that are skeptical of the scientific opinion that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Questions have been raised about the legality of the company’s foreign business practices. Critics note that ExxonMobil increasingly drills in terrains leased by dictatorships. The company has also has been the target of accusations of improperly dealing with human rights issues, influence on American foreign policy, and its impact on the future of nations.
Organization.
ExxonMobil markets products around the world under the brands of Exxon, Mobil, and Esso. It also owns hundreds of smaller subsidiaries such as Imperial Oil Limited (69.6 percent ownership) in Canada, and SeaRiver Maritime, a petroleum shipping company.
The upstream division dominates the company's cashflow, accounting for approximately 70 percent of revenue. The company employs over 82,000 people worldwide, as indicated in ExxonMobil's 2006 Corporate Citizen Report, with approximately 4,000 employees in its Fairfax downstream headquarters and 27,000 people in its Houston upstream headquarters.
Operating divisions.
ExxonMobil is organized functionally into a number of global operating divisions. These divisions are grouped into three categories for reference purposes, though the company also has several ancillary divisions, such as Coal & Minerals, which are stand alone.
Operating divisions by category are as follows:
History.
Exxon Mobil Corp. was formed in 1999 by the merger of two major oil companies, Exxon and Mobil. Both Exxon and Mobil were descendants of the John D. Rockefeller corporation, Standard Oil which was established in 1870. The reputation of Standard Oil in the public eye suffered badly after publication of Ida M. Tarbell's classic exposé "The History of the Standard Oil Co." in 1904, leading to a growing outcry for the government to take action against the company.
By 1911, with public outcry at a climax, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Standard Oil must be dissolved and split into 34 companies. Two of these companies were Jersey Standard ("Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey"), which eventually became Exxon, and Socony ("Standard Oil Co. of New York"), which eventually became Mobil.
In the same year, the nation's kerosene output was eclipsed for the first time by gasoline. The growing automotive market inspired the product trademark Mobiloil, registered by Socony in 1920.
Over the next few decades, both companies grew significantly. Jersey Standard, led by Walter C. Teagle, became the largest oil producer in the world. It acquired a 50 percent share in Humble Oil & Refining Co., a Texas oil producer. Socony purchased a 45 percent interest in Magnolia Petroleum Co., a major refiner, marketer and pipeline transporter. In 1931, Socony merged with Vacuum Oil Co., an industry pioneer dating back to 1866 and a growing Standard Oil spin-off in its own right.
In the Asia-Pacific region, Jersey Standard had oil production and refineries in Indonesia but no marketing network. Socony-Vacuum had Asian marketing outlets supplied remotely from California. In 1933, Jersey Standard and Socony-Vacuum merged their interests in the region into a 50–50 joint venture. Standard-Vacuum Oil Co., or "Stanvac," operated in 50 countries, from East Africa to New Zealand, before it was dissolved in 1962.
Mobil Chemical Co. was established in 1950. As of 1999, its principal products included basic olefins and aromatics, ethylene glycol and polyethylene. The company produced synthetic lubricant base stocks as well as lubricant additives, propylene packaging films and catalysts. Exxon Chemical Co. (first named Enjay Chemicals) became a worldwide organization in 1965 and in 1999 was a major producer and marketer of olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene along with speciality lines such as elastomers, plasticizers, solvents, process fluids, oxo alcohols and adhesive resins. The company was an industry leader in metallocene catalyst technology to make unique polymers with improved performance.
In 1955, Socony-Vacuum became Socony Mobil Oil Co. and, in 1966, simply Mobil Oil Corp. A decade later, the newly incorporated Mobil Corp. absorbed Mobil Oil as a wholly owned subsidiary. Jersey Standard changed its name to Exxon Corp. in 1972 and established Exxon as a trademark throughout the United States. In other parts of the world, Exxon and its affiliated companies continued to use its Esso trademark.
On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska and spilled more than of crude oil. The Exxon Valdez oil spill was the second largest in U.S. history, and in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez incident, the U.S. Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. An initial award of $5 billion USD punitive was reduced to $507.5 million by the US Supreme Court in June 2008, and distributions of this award have commenced.
In 1998, Exxon and Mobil signed a US$73.7 billion definitive agreement to merge and form a new company called Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest company on the planet. After shareholder and regulatory approvals, the merger was completed on November 30, 1999. The merger of Exxon and Mobil was unique in American history because it reunited the two largest companies of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust, Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey/Exxon and Standard Oil Co. of New York/Mobil, which had been forcibly separated by government order nearly a century earlier. This reunion resulted in the largest merger in US corporate history.
In 2000, ExxonMobil sold a refinery in Benicia, California and 340 Exxon-branded stations to Valero Energy Corp., as part of an FTC-mandated divestiture of California assets. ExxonMobil continues to supply petroleum products to over 700 Mobil-branded retail outlets in California.
In 2005, ExxonMobil's stock price surged in parallel with rising oil prices, surpassing General Electric as the largest corporation in the world in terms of market capitalization. At the end of 2005, it reported record profits of US $36 billion in annual income, up 42 percent from the previous year (the overall annual income was an all-time record for annual income by any business, and included $10 billion in the third quarter alone, also an all-time record income for a single quarter by any business). The company and the American Petroleum Institute (the oil and chemical industry's lobbying organization) put these profits in context by comparing oil industry profits to those of other large industries such as pharmaceuticals and banking.
On June 12, 2008, ExxonMobil announced that it was transitioning out of the direct-served retail market, citing the increasing difficulty of running gas stations under rising crude oil costs. The multi-year process will gradually phase the corporation out of the direct-served retail market, and will affect 820 company-owned stations and approximately 1,400 other stations operated by dealers distributing across the United States. The sale has not resulted in the disappearance of Exxon and Mobil branded stations; the new owners will continue to sell Exxon and Mobil-branded gasoline and license the appropriate names from ExxonMobil, who will in turn be compensated for use of the brands.
In 2010, ExxonMobil bought XTO Energy, the company focused on development and production of unconventional resources.
In terms of potential future developments, many gas and oil companies are considering the economic and environmental benefits of Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG). This is an innovative technology designed to enable the development of offshore gas resources that would otherwise remain untapped, because environmental or economic factors make it unviable to develop them via a land-based LNG operation. ExxonMobil is waiting for an appropriate project to launch its FLNG development, and the only FLNG facility currently in development is being built by Shell, due for completion in around 2017.
In 2012, ExxonMobil confirmed a deal for production and exploration activities in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
In 2013, Exxon's CEO Rex Tillerson was quoted "Exxon is starting work with Russia's OAO Rosneft in assessing what could be massive reserves of shale oil in Western Siberia", "There is huge shale potential in shale rocks in West Siberia...we just don't know what the quality is".
In November 2013, Exxon agreed to sell its majority stakes in a Hong Kong-based utility and power storage firm, Castle Peak Co Ltd, for a total of $3.4 billion, to CLP Holdings.
Merger.
Pre-deal events.
On June 16, 1998, Mr. Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's CEO, met with Mr. Lucio A. Noto, Mobil's CEO, at Mobil's headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia. At the meeting, Mr. Raymond and Mr. Noto had preliminary discussions about the possibility of a combination of the two companies. Later management continued discussions and permanently informed the Boards.
On August 11, 1998, The British Petroleum Co. PLC and Amoco Corp. announced the terms of their merger agreement. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Raymond and Mr. Noto resumed their discussions taking into account this new pricing benchmark. In mid-August 1998, the management of Mobil asked Goldman Sachs to undertake an analysis of strategic alternatives available to Mobil. On September 14, Goldman Sachs presented to the Mobil Board its analyses regarding the various possible transactions, including a possible merger with Exxon.
At a meeting on October 19, 1998 at Exxon's headquarters attended by Messrs. Raymond, Matthews, Noto and Gillespie, the parties reviewed the possible relative ownership ranges and expanded the discussions to include such issues as the representation of current Mobil directors on the board of the combined company.
During November 1998, Exxon and Mobil exchanged due diligence request lists and representatives and their advisors participated in a video conference and numerous telephone calls and meetings to conduct reciprocal legal, business, accounting and financial due diligence. A reciprocal confidentiality agreement was entered into on November 12.
On November 26, 1998, Mr. Noto and Mr. Raymond spoke by telephone to discuss reports that had appeared in the media about a possible transaction between Exxon and Mobil. On November 27, prior to the opening of NYSE trading, Exxon and Mobil issued a joint statement confirming that the two companies were in discussions of a possible business combination.
Over the course of the weekend of November 27, 1998, Exxon and Mobil representatives and outside counsel continued discussions towards resolving open issues. On the evening of November 30, Messrs. Raymond and Noto reached agreement in principle, subject to Board approval, on the exchange ratio and the resulting exercise price in the stock option agreement.
Following the approval of their Boards, Exxon and Mobil officially signed an agreement and plan of merger on December 1, 1998. Shareholders of both Exxon and Mobil approved the merger in May 1999. In September 29 of that year the European Commission granted antitrust approval. In November 30, 1999, the historic merger was completed. Mobil became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon. The combined company changed its name to Exxon Mobil Corp.
Exxon-Mobil pre-merger events 
The event analysis is very limited because there was no bidding process. The only important public information was merger announcement (December 1, 1998). 10-day cumulative abnormal return (CAR) before this date was +14 percent for Mobil and +0.4 percent for Exxon. The main spike in share prices appeared during November 25 – 30 and negative returns were on the announcement day, i.e. rumors in the media influenced the pricing. Total 20-day CAR (10 days before plus 10 days after the announcement) amounted +19.5 percent for Mobil and +1.07 percent for Exxon.
Market was very positive on Exxon and Mobil on April 19 and 21, 1999 when FTC approved other two big oil mergers – BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco. 3-day CAR reached 5.3 percent for Exxon and 6.8 percent for Mobil. Market also positively reacted on EU Commission approval: 3-day CAR was +2.2 percent for Mobil and +2.4 percent for Exxon. All these signaled that market positively assessed the merger as economically sound and value creating.
Regulators approval.
On September 29, 1999 EU Commission granted its approval of the merger with requirement of vast divestitures and breakup of the European refining and marketing joint venture of BP Amoco and Mobil. Mobil wanted to maintain its relationship with BP Amoco, but EC officials feared that the recent rash of mega mergers could kill off downstream competition in member countries. Mobil was also ordered to sell its share in a large chain of gasoline stations (Aral). Exxon and Mobil sold part of their lubricant base oil manufacturing capacity.
BP Amoco bought Mobil's 30 percent interest in their R&M JV for $1.65 billion, about the value of the assets that Mobil contributed when the deal was established. Mobil also got around $1.08 billion for its interest in Aral.
The US FTC announced on November 30, 1999 that it accepted a proposed settlement of charges that Exxon Corp’s acquisition of Mobil Corp would violate federal antitrust laws. The settlement required the largest retail divestiture in Commission history – the sale or assignment of approximately 2,431 Exxon and Mobil gas stations in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic (1,740), California (360), Texas (319) and Guam (12). In addition, an Exxon refinery in California; terminals; a pipeline and other assets were also subject for sale. 
Ratios overview.
Exxon had better return on assets (6.75 percent) and return on equity (14.57 percent) ratios (Mobil’s were 3.95 percent and 9.01 percent correspondingly). This situation represented Exxon’s better efficiency at using investment funds (shareholder’s equity) to generate earnings growth. Exxon was more stable and effective in using its assets, while Mobil was more volatile and risky. During 1983–1999 Exxon was superior with the exception of 1989, when tanker Exxon Valdez disaster happened and cut profits of the company.
Companies had equal gross margin (38.7 percent vs. 38.52 percent), but Exxon had higher gross operating margin (7.9 percent) and profit margin (5.4 percent) ratios than Mobil (6.56 percent and 3.18 percent correspondingly) which means that Exxon was better in cost-cutting and controlling its expenses. But in some cases low operating expenses can damage long-term profitability and competitiveness of the company.
Liquidity ratios show that both companies were financially stable, but Exxon was in a better situation than Mobil. The Exxon’s current and quick ratios (0.57 and 0.91 correspondingly) were higher than the Mobil’s (0.48 and 0.67 correspondingly) and merged company had significantly improved these results. Ratio of net current assets as a percent of total assets (i.e. working capital to total assets) was distorted after the merger (1.48) probably due to large divestitures that followed the deal.
Solvency status of companies also looked good. Though Exxon again showed its financial supremacy with much higher interest coverage ratio (93.41 compared to Mobil’s 7.78) Generally speaking the better interest coverage ratio means less risk but also might be bad for future performance because of the failure of the management to use additional funds for development. Debt to equity ratio was safe and stable in both companies.
Combined company showed even superior results after the merger, which proved the correlation between positive market reaction on the announcement event and success of the merger.
Deal structure.
Under the merger agreement, an Exxon subsidiary would merge into Mobil so that Mobil becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil. As a result, Exxon would hold 100 percent of Mobil’s issued and outstanding voting securities. Holders of Mobil common stock would receive 1.32015 shares of Exxon common stock for each share of Mobil common stock.
5 days before the announcement Exxon shares price was $72 and 2,431 million shares outstanding ($175 billion market value) compared with $75.25 a share and 779.8 million shares outstanding for Mobil ($58.7 billion market value). With the exchange ratio 1.32015, Exxon paid 1,029.4 million of its shares for Mobil or $74.1 billion. This was a $15.4 billion (26.2 percent) premium over Mobil’s market value or $94.9 a share. After the price run-up Exxon shareholders would own approximately 70 percent of the combined ExxonMobil entity, while Mobil shareholders would own approximately 30 percent. The merger qualified as a tax-free reorganization in the US, and that it was accounted for on a “pooling of interests” basis.
In addition, the merger agreement provided for payment of termination fees of $1.5 billion. Exxon and Mobil also entered into an option agreement that granted Exxon the option to purchase up to 136.5 million shares (14.9 percent) of Mobil common stock at a strike price of $95.96. Exxon could exercise the option after the occurrence of an event, entitling Exxon to receive the termination fee payable by Mobil.
The termination fee and option were intended to make it more likely that the merger would be completed on the agreed terms and to discourage proposals for alternative business combinations. Among other effects, the option could prevent an alternative business combination with Mobil from being accounted for as a “pooling of interests”. Although companies introduced protection against hostile takeover, they didn’t use any collar to protect shareholders. J.P. Morgan & Co. and Davis Polk & Wardwell advised Exxon, and Goldman Sachs & Co. and Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom advised Mobil.
Valuation.
J.P. Morgan performed traditional P/E analysis. Such analysis indicated that Mobil had been trading at an 8 percent to 15 percent discount to Exxon. J.P. Morgan's analysis indicated that if Mobil were to be valued at price to earnings multiples comparable to those of Exxon, there would be an enhancement of value to its shareholders of approximately $11 billion.
Goldman Sachs also reviewed and compared ratios and public market multiples relating to Mobil to following six publicly traded companies: 
P/E multiple for these firms ranged 19.3–23.8. The analysis showed that Mobil was undervalued 5 to 16 percent, relative to comparables with fair price $79–$89 a share. It’s needed to notice that comparables analysis couldn’t capture the synergy effect, value creation and differences.
Simple DCF analysis of Mobil as a standalone company gives range of intrinsic value of $59.8–$79.5 billion or $76.7–102 per share depending on cash flow growth rate.
DCF analysis, based on the estimated pre-tax synergies of $2.8 billion expected to result from the merger, suggested a potential value creation in the short term of approximately $22–25 billion. J.P. Morgan's review suggested that over the long term, the potential for value creation from these elements could be as much as $47–57 billion. So Mobil intrinsic value for this deal was $95–$118.8 a share depending on growth rate.
Since Exxon's market capitalization was significantly larger than Mobil's, Exxon's shareholders would have enjoyed a greater proportion of the value creation if no premium were paid by Exxon in the merger. By offering a premium to Mobil's shareholders, this potential value creation was instead shared in approximately equal proportions between the companies' shareholders and such sharing was deemed to be a reasonable allocation of value creation. J.P. Morgan's analysis showed that for transactions involving smaller companies with a relative market capitalization comparable to that of Mobil pre-announcement, a premium of 15 percent to 25 percent matched market precedent. In comparison, BP paid 35 percent premium for Amoco.
10 days before the completion of the merger, Exxon market value was $184.5 billion ($76 a share) and Mobil – $77.1 billion ($98.5 a share). Pro forma market value of merged company was $261.6 billion. Right after the merger was completed, the share price of combined Exxon-Mobil was $80.56 with 3,461.5 million shares outstanding, which gave $278.8 billion market value or $17.2 billion of additional value created. This figure would be even higher if we consider pre-announcement pro forma combined market value of $233.7 billion. In this case created value reaches $45.1 billion.
Synergy.
The motivations for the Exxon-Mobil merger reflected the industry forces. Companies needed a secure presence in the regions with high potential for oil/gas discoveries and stronger position to make large investments. The benefits of the merger fell broadly in two categories: near-term operating synergies and capital productivity improvements.
Near-term operating synergies. $2.8 billion in annual pre-tax benefits from operating synergies (increases in production, sales and efficiency, decreases in unit costs and combining complementary operations). Management expected to realize the full benefits by the third year after the merger. During the first two years, the benefits should have been partly offset by one-time costs at $2 billion for business integration. The firms also planned to eliminate about 9,000 jobs. A year later, pre-tax annual savings were re-assessed and increased to $3.8 billion.
Capital productivity improvements. Management also believed the combined company could use its capital more profitably than either company on its own. These improvements were realized due to efficiencies of scale, cost savings, and sharing of best management practices. The businesses and assets of Exxon and Mobil were highly complementary in key areas. In the exploration and production area, for example, Mobil's and Exxon's respective strengths in West Africa, the Caspian region, Russia, South America, and North America lined up well, with minimal overlap. The firms also had a presence in natural gas, with combined sales of about 14 bcfd. And Mobil contributed its LNG assets and experience to the venture.
There were technology synergies as well. In upstream, Exxon and Mobil owned proprietary technologies in the areas of: deepwater and arctic operations, heavy oil, gas-to-liquids processing, LNG, and high-strength steel. In downstream, their proprietary technology focused on refining and chemical catalysts. Exxon’s lube base stocks production fitted well with Mobil's leadership in lubes marketing. 
Generally, the Exxon-Mobil deal was a move by the dominant partner to increase its asset base by 30 percent while raising capital productivity.
Corporate affairs.
The current Chairman of the Board and CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp. is Rex Tillerson. Tillerson assumed the top position on January 1, 2006, on the retirement of long-time chairman and CEO, Lee Raymond.
Board of directors.
, the current ExxonMobil board members are:
Production.
ExxonMobil is the largest non-government owned company in the energy industry and produces about 3 percent of the world's oil and about 2 percent of the world's energy.
ExxonMobil, like other oil companies, is struggling to find new sources of oil. According to Wall Street Journal it replaces only 95 percent by volume of the oil it pumps. This stands in contrast to natural gas, where it replaces 158 percent by volume through purchases or finds.
ExxonMobil is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
Revenue and profits.
In 2005, ExxonMobil surpassed Wal-Mart as the world's largest publicly held corporation when measured by revenue, although Wal-Mart remained the largest by number of employees. ExxonMobil's $340 billion revenues in 2005 were a 25.5 percent increase over their 2004 revenues.
In 2006, Wal-Mart recaptured the lead with revenues of $348.7 billion against ExxonMobil's $335.1. ExxonMobil continued to lead the world in both profits ($39.5 billion in 2006) and market value ($460.43 billion).
In 2007, ExxonMobil had a record net income of $40.61 billion on $404.552 billion of revenue, an increase largely due to escalating oil prices as their actual BOE production decreased by 1 percent, in part due to expropriation of their Venezuelan assets by the Chávez government.
As of July 1, 2010, ExxonMobil occupied eight out of 10 slots for Largest Corporate Quarterly Earnings of All Time. Furthermore, it occupies 5 out of 10 slots on Largest Corporate Annual Earnings.
Environmental record.
ExxonMobil has been a contributor to environmental causes (the company donated $6.6 million to environmental and social groups in 2007). Its environmental record has been a target of critics from outside organizations such as the environmental lobby group Greenpeace as well as some institutional investors who disagree with its stance on global warming. The Political Economy Research Institute ranks ExxonMobil sixth among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (15.5 million pounds in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions. In 2005, ExxonMobil had committed less than 1 percent of their profits towards researching alternative energy, less than other leading oil companies.
Exxon Valdez oil spill.
The March 24, 1989, Exxon Valdez oil spill resulted in the discharge of approximately of oil into Prince William Sound, oiling of the remote Alaskan coastline. The Valdez spill is 36th worst oil spill in history in terms of sheer volume.
The State of Alaska's Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council stated that the spill "is widely considered the number one spill worldwide in terms of damage to the environment". Carcasses were found of over 35,000 birds and 1,000 sea otters. Because carcasses typically sink to the seafloor, it’s estimated the death toll may be 250,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, and up to 22 killer whales. Billions of salmon and herring eggs were also killed.
Oil remains on or under more than half the sound’s beaches, according to a 2001 federal survey. The government-created Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council concluded that the oil disappears at less than 4 percent per year, adding that the oil will “take decades and possibly centuries to disappear entirely”. Of the 27 species monitored by the Council, 17 have not recovered. While the salmon population has rebounded, and the killer whales are recovering, the herring population and fishing industry have not.
Exxon was widely criticized for its slow response to cleaning up the disaster. John Devens, the Mayor of Valdez, has said his community felt betrayed by Exxon's inadequate response to the crisis. Exxon later removed the name "Exxon" from its tanker shipping subsidiary, which it renamed "SeaRiver Maritime." The renamed subsidiary, though wholly Exxon-controlled, has a separate corporate charter and board of directors, and the former "Exxon Valdez" is now the "SeaRiver Mediterranean". The renamed tanker is legally owned by a small, stand-alone company, which would have minimal ability to pay out on claims in the event of a further accident.
After a trial, a jury ordered Exxon to pay $5 billion in punitive damages, though an appeals court reduced that amount by half. Exxon appealed further, and on June 25, 2008, the United States Supreme Court lowered the amount to $500 million.
In 2009, Exxon still uses more single-hull tankers than the rest of the largest ten oil companies combined, including the Valdez's sister ship, the SeaRiver Long Beach.
Exxon's Brooklyn oil spill.
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced on July 17, 2007 that he had filed suit against the Exxon Mobil Corp. and ExxonMobil Refining and Supply Co. to force cleanup of the oil spill at Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and to restore Newtown Creek.
A study of the spill released by the US Environmental Protection Agency in September 2007 reported that the spill consists of of petroleum products from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century. The largest portion of these operations were by ExxonMobil or its predecessors. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez oil spill was approximately . The study reported that in the early 20th century Standard Oil of New York operated a major refinery in the area where the spill is located. The refinery produced fuel oils, gasoline, kerosene and solvents. Naptha and gas oil, secondary products, were also stored in the refinery area. Standard Oil of New York later became Mobil, a predecessor to Exxon/Mobil.
Baton Rouge Refinery Benzene Leak.
On June 14, 2012, a bleeder plug on a tank in the Baton Rouge Refinery failed and began leaking naphtha, a substance that is composed of many chemicals including benzene. ExxonMobil originally reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality(LDEQ) that 1,364 pounds of material had been leaked.
On June 18, Baton Rouge refinery representatives told the LDEQ that ExxonMobil's chemical team determined that the June 14 spill was actually a level 2 incident classification which means that a significant response to the leak was required. On the day of the spill the refinery did not report that their estimate of spilled materials was significantly different than originally reported to the department. Because the spill estimate and the actual amount of chemicals spilled varied drastically, the LDEQ launched an in-depth investigation on June 16 to determine the actual amounts of chemicals spilled as well as to find out what information the refinery knew and when they knew it. On June 20, ExxonMobil sent an official notification to the LDEQ saying that the leak had actually released 28,688 pounds of benzene, 10,882 pounds of toluene, 1,100 pounds of cyclohexane, 1,564 pounds of hexane and 12,605 pounds of additional volatile organic compound. After the spill, people living in neighboring communities reported adverse health impacts such as severe headaches and respiratory difficulties.
Baton Rouge Refinery pipeline oil spill.
In April 2012, a crude oil pipeline, from the Exxon Corp Baton Rouge Refinery, burst and spilled at least 1,900 barrels of oil (80,000 gallons) in the rivers of Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana, shutting down the Exxon Corp Baton Refinery for a few days. Regulators opened an investigation in response to the pipeline oil spill. Local Louisiana residents were not informed until days after the Exxon pipeline oil spill.
Yellowstone River oil spill.
The July 2011 Yellowstone River oil spill was an oil spill from an ExxonMobil pipeline running from Silver Tip to Billings, Montana, which ruptured about 10 miles west of Billings on July 1, 2011, at about 11:30 pm The resulting spill leaked an estimated 750 to 1,000 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River for about 30 minutes before it was shut down.
As a precaution against a possible explosion, officials in Laurel, Montana evacuated about 140 people on Saturday (July 2) just after midnight, then allowed them to return at 4 am
A spokesman for ExxonMobil said that the oil is within 10 miles of the spill site. However, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer disputed the accuracy of that figure. The governor pledged that "The parties responsible will restore the Yellowstone River."
Mayflower oil spill.
On March 29, 2013, an ExxonMobil pipeline carrying Canadian Wabasca Heavy crude ruptured in Mayflower, Arkansas, releasing at least 12,000 barrels of oil and forcing the evacuation of 22 homes. The Environmental Protection Agency has classified the leak as a "major spill". Local officials performing disaster relief requested that the FAA impose a no-fly zone, with relief efforts headed by an aviation advisor for ExxonMobile being exempt. After it was imposed it was amended to allow aerial news crews to fly over the area.
Sakhalin-I in the Russian Far East.
Scientists and environmental groups voice concern that the Sakhalin-I oil and gas project in the Russian Far East, operated by an ExxonMobil subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), threatens the critically endangered western gray whale population. In February, 2009, independent scientists, convened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature issued an urgent call for a "...moratorium on all industrial activities, both maritime and terrestrial, that have the potential to disturb gray whales in summer and autumn on and near their main feeding areas" following a sharp decline in observed whales in the main feeding area in 2008, adjacent to ENL's project area. The scientists also criticized ENL’s unwillingness to cooperate with the scientific panel process, which “certainly impedes the cause of western gray whale conservation.”
Funding of global warming disinformation and denial.
ExxonMobil has been accused of paying to fuel disinformation about and denial of anthropogenic global warming (i.e. the rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation due to the greenhouse effect, caused primarily by increased levels of carbon dioxide released in the burning of coal and petroleum-based fuels).
ExxonMobil has drawn criticism from scientists, science organizations and the environmental lobby for funding organizations critical of the Kyoto Protocol and seeking to undermine public opinion about the scientific conclusion that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. According to "Mother Jones Magazine", the company channeled more than $8 million to forty different organizations that have employed disinformation campaigns including "skeptic propaganda masquerading as journalism" to influence opinion of the public and of political leaders about global warming and that the company was a member of one of the first such groups, the Global Climate Coalition, founded in 1989. According to "The Guardian", ExxonMobil has funded, among other groups, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, George C. Marshall Institute, Heartland Institute, Congress on Racial Equality, TechCentralStation.com, and International Policy Network. ExxonMobil's support for these organizations has drawn criticism from the Royal Society, the academy of sciences of the United Kingdom. The Union of Concerned Scientists released a report in 2007 accusing ExxonMobil of spending $16 million, between 1998 and 2005, towards 43 advocacy organizations which dispute the impact of global warming. The report argued that ExxonMobil used disinformation tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry in its denials of the link between lung cancer and smoking, saying that the company used "many of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue." These charges are consistent with a purported 1998 internal ExxonMobil strategy memo, posted by the environmental group Environmental Defense, stating
ExxonMobil has been reported as having plans to invest up to US$100m over a ten-year period in Stanford University's Global Climate and Energy Project.
A survey carried out by the UK's Royal Society found that in 2005 ExxonMobil distributed $2.9m to 39 groups that the society said "misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence".
In August 2006, the "Wall Street Journal" revealed that a YouTube video lampooning Al Gore, titled "Al Gore's Penguin Army", appeared to be astroturfing by DCI Group, a Washington PR firm with ties to ExxonMobil.
In January 2007, the company appeared to change its position, when vice president for public affairs Kenneth Cohen said "we know enough now—or, society knows enough now—that the risk is serious and action should be taken." Cohen stated that, as of 2006, ExxonMobil had ceased funding of the Competitive Enterprise Institute and "'five or six' similar groups".
While the company did not publicly state which the other similar groups were, a May 2007 report by Greenpeace does list the five groups "at the heart of the climate change denial industry" it stopped funding as well as a list of 41 similar groups which are still receiving ExxonMobil funds.
On February 13, 2007, ExxonMobil CEO Rex W. Tillerson acknowledged that the planet was warming while carbon dioxide levels were increasing, but in the same speech gave an unqualified defense of the oil industry and predicted that hydrocarbons would dominate the world’s transportation as energy demand grows by an expected 40 percent by 2030. Tillerson stated that there is no significant alternative to oil in coming decades, and that ExxonMobil would continue to make petroleum and natural gas its primary products, saying: "I'm no expert on biofuels. I don't know much about farming and I don't know much about moonshine. ... There is really nothing ExxonMobil can bring to that whole biofuels issue. We don't see a direct role for ourselves with today's technology."
However, recently Exxonmobil has announced that it will plan on spending up to 600 million dollars within the next 10 years to fund biofuels that come from algae. On July 14, 2010 Exxonmobil announced that, a year after teaming with Synthetic Genomics, Inc., they had opened a greenhouse to research algae as a possible biofuel.
On July 1, 2009, "The Guardian" newspaper revealed that ExxonMobil has continued to fund organizations including the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA) along with the Heritage Foundation, despite a public pledge to cut support of lobby groups who deny climate change.
Criticism.
Environment.
The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, on March 24, 1989, was a watershed moment for environmental critics of the oil industry.
Foreign business practices.
Investigative reporting by "Forbes Magazine" raised questions about ExxonMobil's dealings with the leaders of oil-rich nations. ExxonMobil controls concessions covering off the coast of Angola that hold an estimated of crude.
In 2003, the Office of Foreign Assets Control reported that ExxonMobil engaged in illegal trade with Sudan and it, along with dozens of other companies, settled with the United States government for $50,000.
In March 2003, James Giffen of the Mercator Corp. was indicted, accused of bribing President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan with $78 million to help ExxonMobil win a 25 percent share of the Tengiz oilfield, the third largest in the world. On April 2, 2003, former-Mobil executive J. Bryan Williams was indicted on tax charges relating to this same transaction. The case is the largest under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This series of events is depicted in the film Syriana.
In a U.S. Department of Justice release dated September 18, 2003, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced that J. Bryan Williams, a former senior executive of Mobil Oil Corp., had been sentenced to three years and ten months in prison on charges of evading income taxes on more than $7 million in unreported income, "including a $2 million kickback he received in connection with Mobil's oil business in Kazakhstan." According to documents filed with the court, Williams' unreported income included millions of dollars in kickbacks from governments, persons, and other entities with whom Williams conducted business while employed by Mobil. In addition to his sentence, Williams must pay a fine of $25,000 and more than $3.5 million in restitution to the IRS, in addition to penalties and interest.
Human rights.
ExxonMobil is the target of human rights activists for actions taken by the corporation in the Indonesian territory of Aceh. In June 2001, a lawsuit against ExxonMobil was filed in the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia under the Alien Tort Claims Act. The suit alleges that the ExxonMobil knowingly assisted human rights violations, including torture, murder and rape, by employing and providing material support to Indonesian military forces, who committed the alleged offenses during civil unrest in Aceh. Human rights complaints involving Exxon's (Exxon and Mobil had not yet merged) relationship with the Indonesian military first arose in 1992; the company denies these accusations and filed a motion to dismiss the suit, which was denied in 2008 by a federal judge, but then dismissed in August 2009 by a different federal judge. The dismissal is currently under appeal.
LGBT.
When Exxon Corp. merged with Mobil Corp. in 1999, the newly merged company ended enrollment in Mobil Corp.'s domestic partner benefits for same-sex partners of employees, and it rescinded formal prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual orientation by removing it from the company's Equal Employment Opportunity policy. The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT lobbying group and political action committee, gave ExxonMobil a score of "-25", the first and only negative score, in its Corporate Equality Index, a scorecard that rated 1000 companies on several criteria including diversity training that covers gender identity issues, transgender-inclusive medical coverage including surgical procedures, and "positively engaging the external LGBT community."
On May 26, 2010, ExxonMobil shareholders voted down LGBT benefits for its employees – only 22 percent of shareholders voted yes for the issue.
Many conservative groups have praised ExxonMobil for this action.
Investigative book: "Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power".
A July 2012 review of Steve Coll's book, "Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power", in "The Daily Telegraph" says that he thinks that ExxonMobil has "grown into one of the planet’s most hated corporations, able to determine American foreign policy and the fate of entire nations". In terms of its environmental record, ExxonMobil increasingly drills in terrains leased to them by dictatorships, such as those in Chad and Equatorial Guinea. Steve Coll describes Lee Raymond, the corporation’s chief executive until 2005, as "notoriously skeptical about climate change and disliked government interference at any level". 
Headquarters.
ExxonMobil's headquarters are located in Irving, Texas. As of January 2010, the company is conducting an internal study regarding possible consolidation of facilities to the northern Houston suburb of Spring, at the intersection of Interstate 45 and the Hardy Toll Road. Architectural documents obtained by the Houston Chronicle outline an elaborate corporate campus, including twenty office buildings totaling , a wellness center, laboratory, and multiple parking garages. Alan Jeffers, a spokesperson for the company, did not say whether the consolidation study includes the Irving headquarters, but definitely includes the Fairfax headquarters. Chris Wallace, the chief executive of the Greater Irving-Las Colinas Chamber of Commerce, said that he believed that it does include the headquarters. In October 2010, the company stated that it would not move its headquarters to Greater Houston.

BioPAX

BioPAX (Biological Pathway Exchange) is a RDF/OWL-based 
standard language to represent biological pathways
at the molecular and cellular level. Its major use is to facilitate the exchange of pathway data. 
Pathway data captures our understanding of biological processes, but
its rapid growth necessitates development of databases and computational tools to aid
interpretation. However, the current fragmentation of pathway information across many
databases with incompatible formats presents barriers to its effective use. BioPAX solves this
problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share.
BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and
gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX,
millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from a
growing number of sources, are available. Thus, large amounts of pathway data are available in a
computable form to support visualization, analysis and biological discovery.
It is supported by a variety of online databases (e.g. Reactome) and tools. The latest released version is BioPAX Level 3. There is also an effort to create a version of BioPAX as part of OBO.
Governance and development.
The next version of BioPAX, Level 4, is being developed by a community of researchers. Development is coordinated by board of editors and facilitated by various BioPAX work groups.
Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX) is an extension for Level 3 and proposal for Level 4 to add quantitative data and systems biology terms (such as Systems Biology Ontology). SBPAX export has been implemented by the pathway databases Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages and the SABIO-Reaction Kinetics Database. SBPAX import has been implemented by the cellular modeling framework Virtual Cell.
Other proposals for Level 4 include improved support for Semantic Web, validation and visualization.

Maragoli tribe (Luhya)

The Maragoli, or Logoli ("Ava-Logooli"), are the second largest tribe of the 6 million-strong Luhya nation in Kenya, after the Bukusu. The dialect they speak is called "Llogoli, Urulogoli," or "Maragoli".
Maragoli also refers to the area that the Maragoli tribe settled and occupied. Maragoli clans include the "Va-Gonda, Va-Mavi, Va-Sachi, Va-Saniaga, Va-Vulughi," "Va-Ndega","Va-sari", "Va-ng'ang'a" "Va-Yonga." (The prefix "Va-" refers to people, and is sometimes written "Ba-, Ava-," or "Aba-".)
Origins.
Oral history.
Maragoli history records a migration from the north. The story of the Maragoli people begins with a man called Mulogoli. He was descended from Kintu, who led the progenitors of the Luhya to their current area.
When the Luhya progenitors first arrived in what is now northern Kenya, their ruler of the Luhyas at the time was Kitanga. The Turkana people later came to occupy the area where the Luhya ancestors had settled, and called it Lok-Kitang meaning 'the place of Kitang.' (Lokitaung is a modern town in North-Western Kenya).
Mulogoli was born from the union of Andimi and Mwanzu. Andimi had three wives: Mwanzu the mother of Mulogoli; Amugovolie who had no children and Ndiegu the mother of Mwenje or Anyole (these are the Wanyore, who inhabit Vihiga district together with the Maragoli). Naturally the Nyores and Maragoli are one, they are from the same stock, the stock of Andimi. Mulogoli had a wife called Khaliyesa. She had four male children. These four make the four major clans. The children were: Musaali; Kizungu; Kilima and M'mavi. 
In Maragoli, the word 'Abaluhya' or 'Avaluhya' is pronounced as A(b/v)a-roo-shia, ('b' and 'v' are interchangeable) which means, "the people of the North," "the people of the higher place," "the people from the North," or simply "Northerners."
Luhya ancestors moved further south, probably along the Turkwel river. The Turkwel's principal source is the Suam river. Luhyas, a people who needed a constant source of water for their crops, animals and various industries like metalworking, and building, kept moving along the Suam River depending on various environmental or human triggers, into what is now Western Kenya and Eastern Uganda, and settled near the source of that river, Mt. Elgon.
They displaced a people akin to the Khoisan of Southern Africa and settled in their current homeland of what is now Western Kenya.
Culture.
Luhya culture is comparable to most Bantu cultural practices. Polygamy was a common practice in the past but today, it is only practised by few people, where the man marries under traditional African law or Muslim law. Civil marriages (conducted by government authorities) and Christian marriages preclude the possibility of polygamy.
About 10 to 15 families traditionally made up a village, headed by a village headman ("Rigutu". Rigutu is a post colonial title for a village leader coined from the English word "Recruit". Within a family,the man of the home was the ultimate authority, followed by his first-born son. In a polygamous family, the first wife held the most prestigious position among women. The first-born son of the first wife was usually the main heir to his father, even if he happened to be younger than his half-brothers from his father's other wives. Daughters had no permanent position in Luhya families as they would eventually become other men's wives. They did not inherit property, and were excluded from decision-making meetings within the family. Today, girls are allowed to inherit property, in accordance with Kenyan law."
Children are named after the clan's ancestors, or after their grandparents, or after events or the weather. The paternal grandparents take precedence, so that the first-born son will usually be named after his paternal grandfather (Guka), while the first-born daughter will be named after her paternal grandmother (Guku). Subsequent children may be named after maternal grandparents, after significant events. Some Maragoli names usually have names whereas others do not. For instance, names like Injugu (born during groundnut harvesting), Kabwoni (born during sweet potato harvesting) and Anzala (born during extreme drought) have meanings. Other names like Afandi, Inziria, Mwachi, Aliviza and Asava have no known meaning. Names of events are also commom. For example, Imbarambara (born during road construction), Msuruve (born when a white missionary called Miss Reeves first came to Maragoli land)and Sirinji (born when money was first introduced in the land).
Traditionally, Luhyas practised arranged marriage. The parents of a boy would approach the parents of a girl to ask for her hand in marriage. If the girl agreed, negotiations for dowry would begin. Typically, this would be 12 cattle and similar numbers of sheep or goats, to be paid by the groom's parents to the bride's family. Once the dowry was delivered, the girl was fetched by the groom's sisters to begin her new life as a wife.
Instances of eloping were and are still common. Young men would elope with willing girls, with negotiations for dowry to be conducted later. In such cases, the young man would also pay a fine to the parents of the girl. In rare cases abductions were normal but the young man had to pay a fine. As polygamy was allowed, a middle-aged man would typically have 2 to 3 wives. When a man got very old and handed over the running of his homestead to his sons, the sons would sometimes find a young girl for the old man to marry. Such girls were normally those who could not find men to marry them, usually because they had children out of wedlock. Wife inheritance was and is also practised. A widow would normally be inherited by her husband's brother or cousin. In some cases, the eldest son would also inherit his father's widows (though not his own mother). Modern day Luhyas do not practice some of the traditional customs as most have adopted the Christian way of life. Many Luhyas also live in urban towns and cities for most of their lives and only return to settle in the rural areas after retirement or the death of parents in the rural areas.
The Luhya had extensive customs surrounding death. There would be a great celebration at the home of the deceased, with mourning lasting up to forty days. If the deceased was a wealthy or influential man, a big tree would be uprooted and the deceased would be buried there, after the burial another tree, Mukumu would be planted (This was a sacred tree and is found along most Luhya migration paths it could only be planted by a righteous Lady mostly Virgin or a Very Old Lady). Nowadays, mourning takes shorter periods of time (about one week) and the celebrations are held at the time of burial. "Ovogogo" and "rovego" are post burial ceremonies held to complete mourning rites.
Animal sacrifices were also traditionally practised. There was great fear of the "avaroji" (witches) and "Babini" (wizards). These were "night-runners" who prowled in the nude running from one house to another casting spells.
Most modern day Luhyas are Christians and for some, (if not all), the word for God is Nyasaye or Nyasae.
The word Nyasae when translated into English roughly corresponds with 'Nya (of) and Asae/ Asaye/ Sae/ Saye/ (God). The Luhya traditionally worshipped a god of the same name. When Christianity was first introduced among the Luhya in the early 1900s by various Christian missionaries from Europe and America, the Luhya took the name of their traditional god, Nyasae, forgot about that idol, and gave that name to the Living God of Christianity, the father of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and whose son is Jesus Christ of the Bible.
The first Luhyas who were converted into Christianity applied words that defined some aspects of the religious traditions that they were born into and gave them to Christ and the Christian god.
The Friends Church (Quakers), opened a mission at Kaimosi and the Church of God based in Anderson, Indiana took over the mission in Bunyore. During the same period the Catholic order Mill Hill Brothers came to the area of Mumias. The Church of God of Anderson, Indiana, USA, arrived in 1905 and began work at Kima in Bunyore. Other Christian groups such as the Anglicans (CMS) came in 1906. In 1924 the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada began their work in Nyan'gori. The Salvation Army came to Malakisi in 1936. The Baptists came to western Kenya in the early 1960s.
The first Bible translation in the Luhya language was produced by Nicholas Stamp in the Wanga dialect. Osundwa says he did this translation in Mumias, the former capital of the Wanga kingdom of Mumia. There has been a strong Christian witness among the Luhya in the twentieth century. A religious sect known as Dini ya Msambwa was founded by Elijah Masinde in 1948. They worship "Were," the god of Mt. Elgon, while at the same time using portions of the Bible to teach their converts. They also practice traditional arts termes witchcraft. This movement originally arose as part of an anti-colonial resistance.
Various sources estimate that Luhya are 75–90% professing Christians.
2002-Iriambuka; 2009-DC(Disi wa kavaga)
Other Luhya Initiation.
The Luhya, with the exception of the Marama and Saamia, practised male circumcision. The Maragoli did not practice clitoridectomy.
Traditionally, circumcision was a period of training for adult responsibilities for the youth. Among the Kakamega Luhya, circumcision was carried out every four or five years, depending on the clan. This resulted into various age sets notably, Kolongolo, Kananachi, Kikwameti, Kinyikeu, Nyange, Maina, and Sawa in that order.
Like the Abanyala living in Navakholo do the initiation of their young boys every other year and notably an even year. The initiates were about 8 to 13 years old, and the ceremony was followed by a period of seclusion for the initiates. On their coming out of seclusion, there would be a feast in the village, followed by a period of counselling by a group of elders.
The newly initiated youths would then build bachelor-huts for each other, where they would stay until they were old enough to become warriors. This kind of initiation is no longer practised among the Kakamega Luhya, with the exception of the Tiriki. Nowadays, the initiates are usually circumcised in hospital, and there is no seclusion period. On healing, a party is held for the initiate – who then usually goes back to school to continue with his studies. Among the Bukusu, the Tachoni and (to a much lesser extent) the Nyala and the Kabras, the traditional methods of initiation persist. Circumcision is held every even year in August and December (the latter only among the Tachoni and the Kabras), and the initiates are typically 11 to 15 years old. However, the maragooli would only circumsice boys who had attained marriage age, about 18 to 20 years old. Traditions have however cahnged with the dynamics of life, and currently, like most communuties in kenya, boys are initiated at the time the parent feels appropriate for their children.
Economic activities.
The Luhya are, traditionally, agriculturalists, and they grow different crops depending on the region where they live. Close to Lake Victoria, the Saamia are mainly fishermen and traders, with their main agricultural activity being the raising of cassava. The Bukhusu and the Wanga are mainly cash crop farmers, raising sugar cane in Bungoma and Mumias areas respectively. The Bukhusu also farm wheat in the region around Kitale. The Isukha of Kakamega area and the Maragoli of Vihiga raise tea, while the rocky land of the Nyore is used to harvest stones and gravel for construction. In Bukura area, the Khisa are small scale and only subsistence maize farmers. They also rear cattle, sheep, goats and chicken on a small scale. The Kabras of Malava area raise mainly maize at subsistence levels, with a few also farming sugar cane.
With the rapid modernisation of Kenya, many young Luhya people have emigrated to Nairobi and other towns in search of work.

Sigmaquad

SigmaQuad - Quad Data Rate SRAM is a type of static RAM computer memory that can transfer up to four words of data in each clock cycle. Like Double Data-Rate (DDR) SDRAM, SigmaQuad SRAM transfers data on both rising and falling edges of the clock signal. This requires more wires between the memory device and the memory controller, but doubles the theoretical maximum data transfer rate. SigmaQuad SRAM uses two clocks, one for read data and one for write data. This helps to eliminate problems caused by the propagation delay of the clock wiring, and allows concurrent reads and writes, thereby doubling the transfer rate again.
SigmaQuad SRAM was designed for high-speed communications and networking applications, where data throughput is more important than cost, power efficiency or density. The technology was a joint development by GSI Technology, Sony Microelectronics and ISSI.

Stephen Brown (author)

Stephen James Meridith Brown (born 24 September 1881 in Holywood, County Down, Ireland, died 5 May 1962, in Dublin, Ireland) was an Irish Catholic priest, writer, bibliographer and librarian. He founded the Central Catholic Library () in Dublin.
Life.
Although he was born in County Down, Stephen Brown spent his early years in Naas, County Kildare, where his father was a solicitor and Chairman of Kildare County Council (1899-1911).
He was educated at Clongowes Wood College and entered the Jesuit noviceship in 1897. He studied philosophy in Jersey, and was ordained in 1914.
He initially taught at Maynooth College, and afterwards established the post-graduate school in librarianship at University College Dublin, an interest he maintained for some 24 years. In 1922 he set up the Central Catholic Library, where he later served as Director. He served on the Hospital Library Council and as Director of the Academy of Christian Art. In 1953 he received a certificate of Honorary Fellowship from the Library Association of Ireland, for his contribution to the development of the library profession in Ireland.
While involved with the Central Catholic Library and other, mainly library-based, activities, he was also a prolific writer of books, bibliographies and articles of all kinds up to the end of his life. 
In September 1960, Fr Brown became incapacitated as the result of a serious road accident in London. A fractured skull and rib injuries forced him to spend four months in the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in Grove End Road in London. He returned to Dublin but never recovered from his injuries. He died in Milltown, Dublin.

Mapcom Systems

Mapcom Systems is the software developer of M4 Solutions - a map-based Visual Management software suite designed to display and allow access to the network data of telecommunications providers. Founded in 1971 by Thurmond Vernon, Mapcom Systems contracts with telecommunications independents, cooperatives, fiber communities, and campus telecommunications providers. The company is located in Chesterfield County, Virginia. Mapcom currently employs approximately 70 employees.
History.
Mapcom Systems began as a company contracted to Continental Telephone, an eventual acquisition of Verizon. Mapcom produced hand-scribed maps of Continental Telephone's network lines and equipment, and developed a Service System Control method for integrating the large amount of data contained in thousands of individual maps. In 1988, developers at the company began to write software programs for data translation, leading ultimately to the development of M4, the primary product Mapcom marketed and sold to telecommunications clients. The original M4 program included a database linked to a mapping portion within the program via an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connection. 
In the mid-1990s, an infusion of capital from Virginia Commercial Finance, Inc., helped Mapcom to triple sales and employment totals. The company became known as Mapcom Systems in 2001 after a change in ownership. The company's focus shifted from being services-oriented towards offering software solutions to telecommunications companies with its Geographical Operations System focus. 
The integration engine and capabilities of the company have changed the perception of information management in the telecom industry, especially among small providers. A number of recent partnerships demonstrate the growing significance of integration in the field. Mapcom has agreements with billing software providers like UDP, the Mid America Computer Corp. (MACC), Quintrex Data Systems, Martins, CDG, Telesphere, Commsoft, and various in-house solutions. In 2006, Mapcom was able to reach an agreement with international corporation Navteq to "integrate Navteq map data" with Mapcom's M4 product. Fleet Management Systems (FMS) agreed to an "authorized distributor relationship" with Mapcom in 2007, combining the satellite Global Positioning System (GPS) communication technology of FMS with the dispatcher-technician communication technology of Mapcom's product M4 Dispatch Manager. Another integration and joint marketing agreement - this time between Mapcom Systems and Centina Systems in 2008 - aimed to increase oversight services Mapcom could deliver to clients for responding to network disruptions. Partnerships also exist between Mapcom Systems and Atwater Mapping & Consulting Services, Calix, Communications Consulting Services, Inc., Henkels & McCoy, McCall-Thomas Engineering Company (MTE), and Westronic.
Currently, Mapcom sells Version 12.0.0 of its M4 Solutions software.
Products.
Mapcom Systems presently markets and operates its software programs to companies that maintain telecommunications and fiber optics networks. The M4 Foundation is a digital mapping program that ties individually mapped elements to accessible database tables, providing users with a method for real-time updates to data records in accordance with changes made to the digital, geographic land base. 
Mapcom also markets corollary programs to deal with telephony, cable, fiber, work orders, network equipment, record keeping, and integration specifics. The M4 Solutions software suite is marketed as a Visual Management solution for telecommunications companies.
Market.
Mapcom currently lists over 150 telecommunications clients across the Continental United States, Alaska, the Caribbean, and Central America. Recently, the company has also expanded its cliental to include American university campuses. Mapcom operates in competition with StellarRAD Systems, Bentley Systems, SAPIENCE360, Martin Group, and Telcordia Technologies, among others.

Mongolian Amateur Radio Society

The Mongolian Amateur Radio Society (MARS) (in Mongolian, Монголын радио сонирхогчдын холбоо) is a national non-profit organization for amateur radio enthusiasts in Mongolia. Key membership benefits of MARS include the sponsorship of amateur radio operating awards and radio contests. In the spring of 2008, MARS purported to be a successor organization to the Mongolian Radio Sport Federation, and supplied the International Amateur Radio Union with documentation regarding a name change and updated organizational constitution. The name change from Mongolian Radio Sports Federation to Mongolian Amateur Radio Society was recognized by the IARU Region I Executive Committee at its April, 2008 meeting. Subsequent to that meeting, the IARU determined that the name change documentation was not authorized by the Mongolian Radio Sport Federation, which had in fact not changed its name or constitution, and continued to exist as a separate organization. The IARU currently recognizes the MRSF as the IARU member society representing Mongolia.

Francisco Hernández Girón

Francisco Hernández Girón, born in Cáceres, Extremadura, died in Lima on December 7, 1554, was a Spanish conquistador.
Hernández Girón arrived in Peru in 1535 with, among others, the future governor Blasco Núñez Vela. In the ensuing struggle for power between the Pizarro brothers and the Almagristas in 1537, he supported neither. Almagro was executed in 1538 and Francisco Pizarro, governor of Peru, was assassinated by Almagro's son in 1541. In the struggle following once next governor Cristóbal Vaca de Castro had defeated the Almagristas at Chupas and then becoming imprisoned by Blasco Núñez Vela, appointed royal viceroy, Hernández Girón became a supporter of the latter. As such he fought at the battles of Añaquito and managed to escape death in an emerging defeat. At Jaquijahuana, he again took the side of the royal forces under Pedro de la Gasca, with great success. On November 13, 1553, he, however, led a rebellion towards the new rule caused by unequal charges proclaimed by Melchor Bravo de Saravia, the new viceroy and second to follow. He was defeated on December 7, 1554, and executed in Lima.

Mohamed El-Gabbas () (born on July 1, 1987 in Port Said), also known as "Doody" El Gabbas, is an Egyptian football forward. El-Gabbas is currently playing for Arles, having also recently played for the Belgian First Division team Lierse S.K. and the Egyptian national team.
Career.
Mohamed El-Gabbas was playing for the youth ranks at Al-Masry at the age of 14. He then got noticed by a youth scout from Newcastle and he played alongside goalkeeper Roy Carroll and now-West Ham striker, Andy Carroll in the youth ranks at Newcastle. After playing for a year for Newcastle's youth team, El-Gabbas unfortunately could not obtain a work permit and therefore was not able to sign a professional contract with Newcastle. As a result, El-Gabbas returned to his former Egyptian club Al-Masry.
After 2 seasons with Al-Masry, El-Gabbas shone like a star scoring many goals in Egyptian league and cup competitions, leading to both Egyptian giants Al-Ahly and Zamalek looking to obtain his signature. However, he decided to sign for Belgian Second Division side Lierse S.K. in 2009. There he played comfortably alongside his Egyptian teammates Ahmed Samir, Sherif El Baily and Mohamed Abdel Wahed. He consistently played in a very successful Lierse season as they got promoted to the Belgian Pro League in 2010. As the years went on, El-Gabbas was always one of the first choice strikers along with Wesley Sonck and Soufiane Bidaoui. His impressive goal-scoring ability drew the attention of Egypt national team coaches Hassan Shehata and Bob Bradley and also some other clubs from bigger leagues in Europe. In an interview with El-Gabbas on Melody Sport, El-Gabbas stated that he is enjoying himself at Lierse and wouldn't mind staying and helping the team but he "would like to move to a bigger league in Europe in the near future." El-Gabbas later stated that he has offers from French and Dutch teams and he would like to move "at the end of the 2012 season or in the 2013 season."
International career.
He was named to the Egypt squad for a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Rwanda and Zambia. El-Gabbas was called to the national team more with current Egypt team coach Bob Bradley then before-coach Hassan Shehata. He has taken part in numerous friendlies and in World Cup and African Cup qualifiers.

Fly on the Wall (song)

"Fly on the Wall" is a song recorded by American singer Miley Cyrus for her second studio album, "Breakout" (2008). It was released on February 12, 2009 as the second and final single from the album by Hollywood Records. It was written by Cyrus and Devrim Karaoglu with the song's producers Antonina Armato and Tim James. The song contains pop rock, dance-pop and synthpop elements. The song's lyrics have been interpreted in a number of ways, such as a description of an abusive boyfriend. In actuality, Cyrus says the song describes paparazzi and their extensive personal privacy invasions.
The song received critical praise, with several critics claiming it defied teen pop expectations and was "Breakout"'s best track. Despite only reaching number eighty-four on the United States chart "Billboard" Hot 100, "Fly on the Wall" performed better commercially in various European regions. "Fly on the Wall" reached its highest international peak on the UK Singles Chart, at number sixteen. The single's music video was directed by Philip Andelman and premiered on "FNMTV". The "Thriller" inspired video takes place mainly in a parking garage in which Cyrus encounters and attempts to escape the paparazzi. Cyrus promoted the song through several venues, including a performance on her second headlining tour, the Wonder World Tour, that incorporated a short segment of the "Thriller" dance. Cyrus also performed the song in the Gypsy Heart Tour.
Background.
The song's lyrics, written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato, Tim James and Devrim Karaoglu, have been mistakenly interpreted in a variety of ways. The song's protagonist sings in first person perspective while condemning an unspecified subject for wanting to invade her privacy. The majority of reviewers thought the protagonist was referring to a "controlling boyfriend". Ben Ratliff of "The New York Times" sided with the boyfriend, and believed the song's protagonist was "bullying some poor boy for the sin of wanting to know what she talks about with her friends." Sarah Rodman of "The Boston Globe" believed the song could have described a number of subjects, such as "a former boyfriend, the media, and even her fans." However, in an interview with Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Cyrus said the song was about "the media" and "how they think they know everything about when they don't. They want to be a fly on my wall and watch [her 24/7." Cyrus elaborated on the concept in an interview with Nancy O'Dell of "Access Hollywood". She stated, 
Composition.
"Fly on the Wall" is a pop rock song with strong uses of electric guitars, keyboards and soprano vocals. Influences derive from electronic music, industrial music, the 1980s and New Wave. It is set in common time with a moderately fast rock tempo of 143 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of G minor. Cyrus' vocals spans two octaves, from G3 to D5. The song has the following chord progression, G5—D—Gm7. The song's chorus has the use of a vocal hook; the hook sings, "fly on the wall".
Critical reception.
"Fly on the Wall" received generally positive reviews. Bill Lamb of About.com called the song an "amphetamine rush" and praised it for its teen pop and generic appeal, classifying it as one of the "top tracks on "Breakout"". Heather Phares of Allmusic said the song was a "G-rated version" of Britney Spears' song "Toxic" and provided hints of Cyrus' future musical direction. Sarah Rodman of "The Boston Globe" said "Fly on the Wall" was a change of pace for Cyrus and called it "the album's most interesting tune." Mikael Wood of "The Los Angeles Times" said the song is a result of regular Walt Disney Company standards, yet "the CD's best cut." Along with "Full Circle," Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said the song was a "more worthy" follow-up to "See You Again." Mordechai Shinefield of "The Village Voice" stated the song was "blazingly brilliant" and that it was "the best, angriest song "Breakout"." Johnny Dee of Virgin Media said the song and "7 Things" were "feisty pop belters" that would encourage a long-term career. Ratliff negatively compared "Fly on the Wall" to the Pussycat Dolls and said that although Cyrus' voice is generally rich with a deep range, it became "pinched and stingy" in the single.

Music video.
In an interview with MTV News, director Philip Andelman explained that Cyrus was already determined to poke fun at the paparazzi when she contacted him for a "Fly on the Wall" music video. Andelman did not want to create "something too serious" and worked to give the video a "playful" aspect. Cyrus elaborated on the concept of the music video in an interview with Nancy O'Dell of "Access Hollywood". Cyrus said, 
The video commences with a short segment of a dramatic music. It then focuses on Cyrus, wearing a white tank top, jeans, boots and a black leather jacket, and her boyfriend leaving a movie theater and discussing the movie they saw. Suddenly, Cyrus' boyfriend begins to cough as a full moon emerges from behind the clouds. Cyrus is horrified as she watches him transform into a paparazzi, and runs away from him as he shouts "Miley, come here. I just want a couple of shots" and tries to snap pictures of her. The music of "Fly on the Wall" begins as Cyrus runs into a parking garage and tries to hide behind a pillar and a black Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. As soon as Cyrus tries to move away from the car, a mob of paparazzi begins to chase her with their cameras. Throughout much of the video, Cyrus runs and hides from the mob. Clips interspaced throughout the video feature her in a long silver shirt and jeans singing and dancing in front of the Mercedes. Eventually, Cyrus is cornered by the paparazzi. She is scared, but then surprised and perplexed when the mob unexpectedly begins to dance in a synchronized manner. Her boyfriend, appearing normal, then arrives in the Mercedes to rescue her. Inside the car, Cyrus describes her strange encounter with the paparazzi to him. Unknown to Cyrus, her boyfriend has planted a video camera in the car; the music video concludes with a shot of the website he posts the video on beneath the headline, "Miley Cyrus Bugs at Paparazzi!!!" The music video to "Fly on the Wall" was first seen on December 5, 2008 on MTV's "FNMTV". The video is inspired by Michael Jackson's iconic music video, "Thriller", but trades zombies for paparazzi.

Aspremont (chanson de geste)

Aspremont is a 12th-century Old French "chanson de geste" (before 1190). The poem comprises 11, 376 verses (unusually long for a "chanson de geste"), grouped into rhymed laisses. The verses are decasyllables mixed with alexandrines.
In this tale, the African Saracen king Agolant and his son Helmont invade Calabria and defy Charlemagne through their messenger Balant. Charlemagne's troops come to fight them, but Charlemagne's nephew Roland is not allowed to join the battle due to his young age. The armies reach Aspromonte, and Charlemagne's paladins Naimes and Girart de Fraite prove their worth. In the end, Charlemagne is saved by Roland who defeats Helmont and his uncle forgives him his disobedience. In gratitude, Charlemagne gives Roland Helmont's horse (Veillantif) and sword (Durandal). In the end, Agolant dies and Charlemagne returns in triumph, although future battles with a disloyal Girart de Fraite are predicted.
Versions of this "chanson" were extremely popular in England, Italy (see the adaptation by Andrea da Barberino) and even Scandinavia.

Provo City Library

The Provo City Library is a public library serving residents of Provo in the U.S. state of Utah. It occupies the building of the former Brigham Young Academy, which was built in 1892. In 1976, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. After a remodeling process, it was rededicated as the Provo City Library on September 8, 2001.
History of Library.
Provo City Library was founded in 1905. It first opened in the basement of the Provo City courthouse in October of that year and operated until 1908. During its operation in the courthouse, it acquired 1,425 books donated by individuals in the community. Soon after that, the collection doubled to 3000 volumes by April 1908. On December 1, 1908, the Library moved into a new building provided by a grant of $17,500 from Andrew Carnegie. Over the years, the library grew in size, by obtaining approximately 65,000 volumes and 125 periodical subscriptions.
In 1989, the Library moved to another location, The City Center Building. Although it was bigger than before, it became inadequate within a couple of years.
In February 1997 a $16 million library bond passed which allowed the library to move to a bigger location. The bond helped preserve and renovate the historic Brigham Young Academy building, which the library then occupied. On July 9, 1999, city officials broke ground to initiate renovations for the new library and then on September 8, 2001 the library began full operations.
History of Academy Square.
The Brigham Young Academy was one of the largest school buildings in the western Rocky Mountain region. The Principal of the Academy, Karl G. Maeser, designed the building with the help of Don Carlos Young as the architect. The Academy was located in Northern Provo. The name of the building has changed many times: in 1898, it was known as the High School Building, and in 1922 it was known as the Education Building, which it remained until 1968.
For the next 20 years, Academy Square remained vacant and slowly began to deteriorate. While real estate developers were eager to tear down the dilapidated buildings, Provo residents supported the preservation of the historic site. In 1997, a municipal bond and private donations financed the renovation of the Education Building; the other three buildings on Academy Square were demolished to make room for a parking garage. Fundraising and restoration efforts were spearheaded by BYU professor L. Douglas Smoot, who gained the moniker "the man who saved Academy Square." Construction was completed in 2001 and the project succeeded to what is now known as the Provo City Library.
Facts.
There are almost 285,000 books, magazines, and media in circulation available to Provo Library cardholders at the Provo City Library. The checkout period for all items is three weeks. There is no limit on the number of books, magazines, music, videocassettes or audio books that may be checked out; however, there is a maximum of 4 DVD's.

DRG Class 99.21

The only example of the German DRG Class 99.21 steam locomotive was built for the Wangerooge Island Railway on Wangerooge, one of the German-owned Friesian islands in the North Sea.
History.
For hauling eight-wheeled passenger coaches a more powerful locomotive was needed. After the procurement of diesel locomotives in 1958 she remained for a time as a reserve engine. She carried number 99 211.
Today the locomotive is restored and is displayed as a monument on Wangerooge.
Technical Details.
The inner frame of the locomotive was also used as a water tank. She was designed as a wet steam locomotive. The boiler had two shell rings and 90 heating tubes. The drive was achieved via a Walschaerts valve gear driving the third axle. The wheels on the centre axle were made without flanges to improve curve running. 
The engine could hold 0.6 tonnes of coal in side tanks either side of the boiler, and 1.8 m² of water in the frame and in an attachment to the coal bunker.
The engine was first equipped with electrical lighting in 1953.

Casey, Rodimer was Administrator of Our Lady of the Lake Parish in Sparta from April 1967 to January 1968, at which time he became Pastor of St. Paul Parish in Clifton. He also served as the Diocesan Chancellor, and in that capacity, was elected Diocesan Administrator by the College of Consultors upon Bishop Casey's death in June 1977. 
On December 5, 1977, Pope Paul VI appointed Rodimer the sixth Bishop of Paterson, the first native-born bishop in the diocese. He was ordained bishop on February 28, 1978, with Archbishop Peter Gerety of the Archdiocese of Newark as principal consecrator, and Archbishops Joseph Bernardin of Cincinnati and Peter Poreku Dery of Tamale, Ghana serving as co-consecrators.
As bishop, Rodimer wrote a weekly column for the diocesan newspaper, "The Beacon". He also established a $7 million diocesan endowment to support Catholic schools, parishes and other diocesan ministries through fund raising. With corporate leaders, Bishop Rodimer established the Tri-County Scholarship fund which continues to provide scholarships to needy students attending Catholic schools conducted by the diocese and parishes in Passaic, Morris and Sussex counties.
During his tenure, Rodimer made public his opposition to capital punishment and permanent replacements for striking workers.
Although he once declared, "I fear for a society which deplores but does little or nothing to address the horrible daily realities which many of our children face", Rodimer admitted his "own inadequacy" in failing to prevent at least four of his clerical colleagues, with whom he shared a Long Island beach house, from committing sexual abuse. 
Rodimer retired as Bishop on June 1, 2004, after twenty-six years of service. He was succeeded by Bishop Arthur Serratelli.

Battle of Huarina

After sending away royal appointed governor of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Blasco Núñez Vela and later defeating and killing him in the battle of Añaquito, Gonzalo Pizarro assembled an army of 1,200 men to press claims for the rule over Peru, once belonging to him and his brothers. The new viceroy, Pedro de la Gasca, landed in Peru in 1547, and a contingent of his troops, led by Diego Centeno, was severely defeated at Huarina by Francisco de Carvajal (dubbed the "Deamon of the Andes", for his treatment of native Peruvians in his quest for glory and power.) 
Centeno, however, remained successful in retreating in order and later united with the main force under de la Gasca. Ultimately, the viceroy managed to win the cause of most of Gonzalo Pizarro's officers and men, and on April 9, 1548, the pizarrists were finally overthrown in the battle of Jaquijahuana.

Clairemont – Great Lakes (Decatur)

Clairemont - Great Lakes is a historic neighborhood in the north central section of the Atlanta, Georgia suburb of Decatur. It primarily consists of residences and churches. However, there are businesses on West Ponce de Leon Avenue, in the southernmost section of the neighborhood. Its rough boundaries are Coventry Road, Ponce de Leon Avenue and Commerce Drive on the south; Church Street on the east; Scott Boulevard on the north; and Willow on the northeast. The section of Superior Avenue north of Scott Boulevard is also considered part of this neighborhood. Ridgeland Park, located northeast of the Clairemont - Great Lakes neighborhood, is not presently considered part of the neighborhood. It was developed later (1946–1950) and is in unincorporated DeKalb County. However, in 2008 the city of Decatur began evaluating annexation of this neighborhood, which is contiguous to the rest of the development.
The "Clairemont Historic District" primarily falls within the Clairemont - Great Lakes neighborhood. Enacted in 2001, the local historic district runs the length of Clairemont Avenue from to Maediris Drive in the north to Commerce Drive in the south. The small portion from Scott Blvd. to Maediris lies in Decatur's Clairemont - Gateway neighborhood association, and not the Clairemont - Great Lakes neighborhood.
History.
Clairement Avenue originally followed part of a Native American trail leading to a shallow crossing at the Chattahoochee. It was previously known as Shallowford Trail and Webster Street. However, the Clairemont - Great Lakes neighborhood was not laid out until the early 20th Century. Beginning in 1913 and continuing through to the 1930s, it was developed in sections. As can be perceived from the name, the Clairemont - Great Lakes neighborhood actually consists of four smaller neighborhoods. These include the Great Lakes neighborhood, which has streets named after famous lakes; Clairemont Avenue, which bisects the center of the neighborhood in a north-south direction; Clairemont Estates; Emory Acres; and Ponce de Leon Terrace. Robert H. Paris developed Superior St., Michigan St., Seneca St., Huron St., Champlain St., Erie Ave., Geneva St., Lucerne St. and Parkside Circle from 1913 through the 1920s.
Architecture.
Clairemont - Great Lakes contains numerous architectural styles. The most common are Craftsman Bungalows, English Vernacular Revival and Georgia Vernacular Bungalows. Other styles include American Foursquare, Dutch Colonial and Moderne. There are also late 20th century townhomes and 21st century Brownstone townhomes on Scott Blvd.
Churches.
Churches within the neighborhood include:

Joe Bottom

Joseph Stuart Bottom (born April 18, 1955) is an American former competition swimmer, Olympic medalist, and former world record-holder in the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly and 4x100-meter freestyle relay.
Born in Akron, Ohio, Bottom moved with his family at age 11 to Santa Clara, California, where he was a member of the Santa Clara Swim Club under noted swim coach George Haines. He attended Santa Clara High School, where he contributed to the Panthers numerous California Interscholastic Federation — Central Coast Section championships and set several Section records from 1971–73. 
Bottom attended the University of Southern California (USC), where he was an All-American swimmer for the USC Trojans swimming and diving team from 1974 to 1977. He graduated in 1977 with a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering and was a member of Eta Kappa Nu and Tau Beta Pi. In 1977, he was the first swimmer ever to crack 20 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle, at 19.70. He held USC's record for 50-yard freestyle until the 2006-2007 season, and has the third fastest 100-yard freestyle and sixth-fastest 100-yard butterfly times in school history. He won five NCAA individual and 4 relay titles with the Trojans. He was the captain of the 1977 Trojans swim team. Known for an easygoing personality, Bottom was a fierce competitor during meets.
At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Bottom won the silver medal in the 100-meter butterfly and came in sixth in the 100-meter freestyle. He also won a gold medal as a member of the 4×100-meter medley relay team, swimming in the qualifying round. At the prime of his career, he was unable to compete at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow due to the U.S. Boycott. 
During the inaugural, 1973 World Aquatics Championships in Belgrade, Bottom took silver in the 100-meter butterfly and gold in both the 4×100-meter freestyle and 4×100-meter medley relay events. At the 1978 World Championships in Berlin he took gold in the 100-meter butterfly as well as the 4x100-meter medley relay. He won nine U.S. national championships between 1974 and 1980.
On August 27, 1977, at the East Germany-United States dual meet in East Berlin, Bottom broke Mark Spitz's five-year-old 100-meter butterfly world record with a time of 54.18 seconds. The night before the record-setting race, Bottom suffered from insomnia and took a sleeping pill only to oversleep and miss his usual pre-race warmup swim; incredibly, he broke Spitz's record anyway. He was also a part of the team that set the new 4x100-meter freestyle relay world record on September 1, 1974.
In 2007, Bottom was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame; several of his records set at USC remain unbroken. He was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2006. 
Bottom currently resides in Chico, California, where he is a management consultant and serving as Senior Manager in Accenture's Marketing Sciences Practice within the Retail Products Industry. His younger brother, Mike Bottom, also swam at USC where he was a three time All-American (1975–77); Mike is currently one the world's top sprint coaches.

Nicomedes Santa Cruz

Nicomedes Santa Cruz Gamarra (June 4, 1925 – February 5, 1992), known as Nicomedes Santa Cruz, was a black Peruvian musician who, from the 1950s onwards, helped to raise public awareness of Afro-Peruvian culture. 
Biography.
Santa Cruz was born in La Victoria District, Lima, Peru to Nicomedes Santa Cruz Aparicio and Victoria Gamarra Ramirez, and was the ninth of ten siblings. After his schooling it was decided that he would work as a blacksmith, which he did until 1956, when he left his workshop and traveled throughout Peru and Latin America, composing and reciting his poems. In 1945 he met Don Porfirio Vasquez (father of the singer Pepe Vazquez), who became a decisive influence on Santa Cruz's development as a "decimero", a composer using the décima form. Porfirio Vasquez came to Lima in 1920 and was an early pioneer of the movement to regain the lost cultural identity of Afro-Peruvians. 
Santa Cruz assumed the task of reviving Afro-Peruvian folklore through a theater company he organized with his sister Victoria Santa Cruz (1959–1961), through radio broadcasts, and through his collaborations in the daily newspapers "Expreso" and "El Comercio" as well as other publications. In 1959, with his group Conjunto Cumanana, he recorded the album "Kumanana", followed in 1960 by "Ingá" and "Décimas y poemas Afroperuanos". In 1964 he recorded a four-album set, "Cumanana". In 1967 he attended the Canción Protesta Encuentro in Cuba, and recorded his poem "Benny 'Kid' Paret, which was issued on the album "Canción Protesta".
He made his theater debut in 1957 at the Teatro Municipal de Chile, with the company Pancho Fierro, in a show called "Black Rhythms of Peru". He also ventured into journalism, radio and television. During his travels he continued to participate in events promoting Afro-Peruvian folklore, notably his address at the first Black Arts Festival, held in Cañete, in August 1971. In 1974 he traveled for the first time to Africa, where in Dakar, Senegal, he participated in the symposium "Négritude et Amérique Latine", with his lecture "Aportes de las civilizaciones africanas al folklore del Peru". That same year he traveled to Cuba and México, participating in a series of television programs, as well as later trips to Japan (1976), Colombia (1978), Cuba, Canción Protesta Encuentro (1967), Cuba (1979), Panama (1980).
In 1980 he moved to Madrid, where he lived until his death, working as a journalist at Radio Exterior de España. In 1987 he began collaborating in preparing a series of LP record albums called "Espana en su Folklore", a collection of songbooks from Spain and America. In 1989 he taught a seminar on African culture in Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) and the following year participated in the expedition Adventure 92, touring ports in Mexico and Central America. 
He died of lung cancer on February 5, 1992, after surgery at the Clinical Hospital in Madrid.
Legacy.
June 4, the birthday of Nicomedes Santa Cruz, has since 2006 been celebrated as a Day of Afro-Peruvian Culture.
In 2010 the Peruvian hip-hop group Comité Pokoflo released a tribute song, "Tributo a Nicomedes", in their mixtape "El Grito".

DRG Class 99.19

The DRG Class 99.19 engines were metre gauge, ten-coupled, superheated, steam locomotives that were employed in the southwestern German state of Württemberg from 1927.
In fact this class was to have been procured by the Royal Württemberg State Railways ("Königlich Württembergische Staats-Eisenbahnen") as the Class Ts 5, however the intervention of the First World War and the serious economic situation that followed put paid to that.
In 1927 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft ordered the construction of four of these locomotives from the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen. They were based on a Saxon VI K prototype that already ran on Württemberg's 750mm routes and replaced some ancient Klose locomotives that worked the metre gauge route between Altensteig and Nagold. They were given operating numbers 99 191 - 99 194.
To negotiate the tight curves the first, third and fifth axles were given side play. 
Engine number 99 191 was redeployed on 1 April 1944 to work the line between Eisfeld and Schönbrunn. In 1955 she was used in Gera. In the 1970s there was a plan to sell her to a museum railway, but it did not come to fruition and the engine was scrapped.
Locomotive number 99 192 was retired on 5 May 1959. Number 99 193 was retired on 30 November 1967 and was transferred into the ownership of EUROVAPOR, where she is used on the Blonay-Chamby museum railway in Switzerland. She was still there in 2007. There are various accounts of the whereabouts of 99 194. She probably ended up in Yugoslavia after the Second World War and was in service there until the late 1960s with the Yugoslav Railways (JŽ).
The engines could hold 2.5 tonnes of coal and 4.66 m² of water.

ISO Standards for colour ink jet printers

In 2006, the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) published the International Standard for determining the ink cartridge yield for colour inkjet printers and multifunctional devices. This standard is used to prescribe the test method that manufacturers and test labs use to determine ink jet cartridge yields. It also standardizes the appropriate method of describing the yield of cartridges in documentation supplied to the consumer by the manufacturer. Manufacturers of printers or devices that use colour ink jet technology are meant to abide by this standard when testing for, and labeling the estimated yields of their products.
The testing focused on sampling yields generated from typical business consumer printing applications. The judgment of total yield was defined by fade, marked by a depletion of ink in the cartridge, or automatic stop, caused by an "Ink Out" detection function.
Methodology: Notable Elements.
All printers are to be set up using priming cartridges. These cartridges are for calibration purposes, and not used in the actual testing procedure. Testing of print devices is to be done in a semi-continuous mode at rated speed. It was noted that this type of testing procedure may not be typical of some common usage patterns for print devices, as in office settings for instance. Quote "the yield experienced by a given user may vary significantly from the yield measured by this test method". The temperature of the testing environment should rest at an average of 23 Degrees Celsius. Paper used in the testing procedure must approximate the medium weight paper and conform to the printers approved specifications.
Disclosure of Information Guidelines for Manufacturers.
Manufacturers must include the following information in their user manuals, marketing materials or packaging when declaring the yield of an ink jet cartridge:
Result derived from testing using ISO/IEC 24711.
Description that the additional yield values have been determined using the procedure defined in ISO/IEC 24711 using the test page defined in ISO/IEC 19752.
The value obtained was using a continuous printing procedure.

George New

Dr. George Edward New (1894–1963) was an etcher and portrait artist whose work garnered him international prestige. He is best known for a portrait of General Billy Mitchell, made from World War I photographs.
Early years.
George New was born November 27, 1894, in a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania suburb. In his early years he traveled with family and attended a number of prep schools on the east coast. A fishing expedition to Wisconsin, with his father, fostered his love for the state which he would eventually call home. New served in World War One on the French side, he was awarded the French Croix de Guerre after sustaining numerous injuries. After the war he finished his education in France and then was involved in archaeological expeditions in North Africa, and Asia.
Milwaukee.
From 1936 until 1941 he was a sort of artist in residence and informal lecturer on the Mount Mary College campus in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, although he never had faculty status. He also lectured occasionally at Marquette University.Dr. New taught art and art appreciation at Mount Mary College and lectured on history of art and cultural anthropology at Marquette University. New was awarded an Honorary Degree from Mount Mary College in 1937 and a Pere Marquette award from Marquette in 1957.
Later life.
New suffered a paralytic stroke on December 26, 1956, from which he never fully recovered. In his later years New continued to etch, but not at the rate prior to his stroke. He died on February 14, 1963. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Racine, Wisconsin on February 20, 1963.
Artwork.
One of George New's most widely known etchings was a portrait of General Billy Mitchell. Other etchings were acquired by the Library of Congress in Washington DC, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and museums in Paris and London. He is responsible for a number of etchings featuring prominent buildings of Midwestern campuses including Northwestern University, Notre Dame University, the University of Chicago, Marquette University, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. New also painted a number of portraits; these included Federal Judge F. Ryan Duffy, Col. Phillp Westfahl, and the last Czar of Russia.
Name controversy.
Due to his eccentric stories, some have questioned if George New was his true name. In a number of letters after his death the possibility of a name change was raised. However, there is no actual evidence to confirm this.

Honda Elysion

The Honda Elysion () is a minivan capable of seating up to 8 people that is sold only in Japan as a competitor to the Toyota Alphard and the Nissan Elgrand. It is related to the USA-spec Honda Odyssey but is not the same vehicle. One of the major differences from the previous generation JDM Honda Odyssey was that the rear doors were exchanged to sliding doors typically used on minivans, whereas the JDM Odyssey used conventional side doors, found on MPVs. The USA-spec Honda Odyssey, known in Japan as the Honda LaGreat, was too large for Japan, so the Elysion took many styling cues from the LaGreat and used them on a smaller vehicle. The Elysion was sold exclusively in Japan at "Honda Clio" dealership sales channels. Due to disappointing sales, and tightening emission regulations, the Elysion was discontinued October 31, 2013.
Honda was inspired to name the vehicle the "Elysion" from the classical Greek word Elysium, or heaven.
First-generation series RR1 thru RR6.
The Elysion appeared at the Tokyo Motor Show, on October 2003 as the "ASM", and was released for sale on 13 May 2004. A mild body restyle was introduced 29 September 2005, introducing an "Aero" and "VG Premium" trim level. 13 January 2006 saw the introduction of the "G Aero HDD Navi" and "VG HDD Navi Aero" edition. Another styling change was introduced 21 December 2006, including an interior update.
The Elysion was offered with either the 2.4 L DOHC direct injection K24A with i-VTEC producing or the 3.0 L SOHC J30A V6 i-VTEC producing . The V6 was also available with "VCM" or Variable Cylinder Management. The upper trim level "Prestige" model was available with the J35A V6 used in the Honda Legend, producing and available AWD. Vehicles equipped with AWD had the same Legend engine, but the power was somewhat reduced to . This was more power than available in the Toyota Estima, which was quoted to be .
The concept.
This MPV was first seen as a concept car called Honda ASM at Tokyo Motor Show in late 2003 and finally made into a production half a year later with some cosmetic adjustments to its headlight, front grill and interior to make it more commercially friendly. Officially launched in mid-2004 for Japan domestic market, Honda Elysion, which derives its name from Greek mythology, loosely translated as a “pleasing/comfortable place”, mark an important history for Honda to show off their finest technical know-how and all round safety, ecology and human comfort.
The design.
Out with predicted normal lines, the oval shaped body which is inspired by nature sculptured carefully to minimize hard edges resulting of low wind noise and low coefficient drag, possible the lowest among all of its rivals and may, in fact, put to shame some of the smaller sedans. The low cd also contributes to better fuel economy and overall stability.
The interior wrap all round with well thought after luxury materials combined with a soft and light soundproof material makes the cabin eerily quiet once you close its doors. However, all this extra luxury contributes to the total weight, which is around 1800 kg a far cry from a bare minimum found in Honda's mainstream models.
Although the car may look large, the actual dimension is actually modest. At 4840 mm, the length is actually the same as the 3.0L second-generation Odyssey RA6 or about 1 cm longer than current Camry. The 1830mm width is about 3 cm wider than the RA6 or about 2 cm wider than Camry. The different is on the clever space management making 70% of total space available as cabin plus the height of 1790mm, which is an extra of 18 cm from RA6 or about 24 cm more than the current odyssey. This extra height puts Elysion seating position high, or about the level of Harrier SUV and plus a very enjoyable roomy interior that can seat 8 adults in total comfort.
Safety.
The combination of a new 30% stronger high-rigidity steel, the Honda G-Con technology and the unique double platform with low central gravity floor, first seen on Merc A-class, makes Elysion (one box car) to achieve the highest 6 stars rating by Nasva and become one of the safest Japanese passenger car production ever, even higher than the competitor's luxury three-box (hood-cabin-boot) sedans.
The high safety percentage translates to how well the car protects its driver and occupants. An extensive crash report is available at this site http://www.nasva.go.jp/mamoru/englis...0_elysion.html
and comparison by different models and brands at this site http://www.nasva.go.jp/mamoru/english/2005/as105.html
The high-rigidity body also benefited to the overall comfort as the car handles any rough roads with poised, free of squeaky found in many older Hondas
The top-of-the-line VZ model is equipped with an IHCC (intelligent highway cruise control) and CMS (collision mitigation sensor) that works with radio-wave radar installed in the front grill to warn driver if he or she get too close with the car ahead and the seatbelt automatically tightening and brake ready, similar to the pre-cash system in the S-class. Interestingly the radar can be double as night vision (a similar concept to the infra red night vision introduced in BMW) as it gives picture in a form of graphic of objects ahead displayed on its built in 8 inch navigation system at the dash.
Other safety equipment includes ABS (anti-lock brake), VSA (vehicle stability), TCS, sideslip, and AFS (adaptive front lighting) on its projector HID Xenon headlight.
Engine and brake.
Two choices of engines are available. The 2.4L i-VTEC K24A that is used in the current Odyssey produces about 160 horses and 22.2 kg-m of torque. With virtually the same specs and gear ratios, it behaves and drives very similar to the current Odyssey and sips about 10,2 km/l in 10-15 Japan standard test (3 times variable city driving stop and go and 1 time highway driving with 120 kg extra weight of two passengers and without a/c).
The compression ratio of 9.7 couples with an anti-knocking sensor and intelligent timing control makes it easy to take RON 95 grade. A similar 2.4L engine but with different overhead and higher compression ratio of 11.0 that produces 200hhp that is used in Honda JDM Odyssey Absolute is not yet available at this time for Elysion.
The other is all new 3.0L V6 i-VTEC J30A incorporates the finest engine technology not seen in other brands yet. The unique VCM (variable cylinder management) behaves like a hybrid able to shut-off 3 cylinders on one the V6 bank when the engine senses that there is a little need of power such as during cruising and downturn. It changes between 6 and 3 cylinder modes virtually effortless without any vibration whatsoever. The only tell-tale sign that the engine is running on 3 cylinders is when the ECO green light at the panels light up.
Unlike the lower-powered small electric hybrid it has 250 horses and 31.5 kg-m of torque under the hood ready whenever needed. The power curve delivers in a linear progression without any blank-spot torque as in it 2.4L engines. This advance i-VTEC engine pulls eagerly at any rpm with an extra surge/boost ala turbo comes above 4,000 rpm when the second cams setting kicks-in with its an intoxicating power all the way toward the redline.
A power ratio of approx 138 hp per ton is enough to propel this car 0–100 km/h under 8 seconds, placing it in rank with serious sports-oriented cars. The great engine matches perfectly with a great suspension and high-rigid-tensional-steel body makes this 3L Elysion not your next-door granddaddy boring MPV.
With a compression ratio of 11.0 it requires premium RON 98 fuel grade (or RON 100 when available) to tap its fullest potential. A regular RON 95 will set the engine 10% less powerful but with no persistent knocking as it has an intelligent timing and anti knocking control. It drives and switching gears extra smooth and sipping fuel at a rate of 9.8 km/l or about the consumption of normal 2.0 to 2.4L engines. In highway driving it can even go as high as 15–16 km/l putting smaller 1.5-2L family sedans as its fuel-sipping rival. In short this engine is a real gem.
All Elysions are equipped with ventilated 4-disk brakes with ABS and EBD.
Trims and specifications.
There are 6 different trim and grades plus 2 special AERO HDD editions. Three grade of 2.4L front-wheel-drive models are available, namely M, G and X. There are also three 3.0L front-wheel-drive models, VG, VX and VZ. Four-wheel-drive is optional on all models.
All six trim levels comes with a long list of standard equipment such as HID Xenon projector lights, dual airbags, antilock brakes, 16-inch aluminum wheels, 215/65 R 16 Yokohama Aspec tyres, a plush and comfortable third row of seats with easy folding 60/40 configuration, 5 speed automatic transmission, UV-cut glass all round and dark privacy glass that confirms to LTA specification makes it unnecessary to install the after market film. Eight individually adjusted interior lights turn on whenever the doors are unlocked, and fade softly into the background when the doors are closed.
The car comes standard with keyless entry and ignition. A keyless security alarm with remote is standard equipment while the touch-less smart card is an option.
A speed sensing door-lock automatically locks any of the unlocked doors when the car moves above 15 km/h and automatically unlocks them when the gear lever switched to P (park). Both front and rear wipers are speed-sensing, and wipe automatically when the car is moving at speed.
The world first super-three-dimensional luminescence meter welcomes you by lighting up the outline when you open the door and becomes brighter when it senses the security programmed RFID key inserted. The meter has a very interesting one-of-the-kind combination of luminescence optitron-like-meters and 3D holographic blue illumination giving the illusion that the meters are sort-of suspended in the air in-between the bluish background and LCD info-display (temperature, trip, fuel consumption bar, doors, etc.) in front, a real feat for the eye. The secret of the 3D effect lies on the blue light projectors installed on the top panel, out-of-sight unless you bent down and see it from below. This is a similar to the holographic-navi-system in the high-end BMW models.
All the necessary buttons placed strategically, classy, clean and ergonomically, all within an easy reach and sight to ensure that the drivers do not need to take his/her eye off the road. The ergonomic at best where the driver can simply rest his or her elbow in the armrest while the hand fiddling with the a/v-commander buttons and the gear lever.
The top quality piano-lacquer wooden panel is integrated nicely to the dashboard and to the door ooze a luxury as it comes in a big whole panel not the skimpy thin strip add-on found in many others.
All four windows equips with one touch power window with auto sensing safety feature. Dual and triple zone climate control allows passenger and driver to adjust the climate separately between left and right. An intelligent sun-sensing A/C adjusts the cabin temperature according to the outside temperature.
In addition all the 3.0L models VG, VX and VZ trim come with illuminated steering button cruise control, dual large exhaust pipe, V6 logo, VCM (variable cylinder management engine), active engine mount to reduce vibration, active noise control, twin silencer and DBW (drive-by-wire) throttle control. This DBW system when used with the cruise control can help save fuel as the ECU will calculate the most efficient fuel vs speed in oppose to self-drive.

Honda announced to introduce the Elysion to the Chinese market in 2012.

Suzuki Kizashi

The Suzuki Kizashi is a mid-size car manufactured by Japanese automaker Suzuki. It was unveiled in the United States on July 30, 2009 and was discontinued in November 2012, when Suzuki filed for bankruptcy in North America. The Kizashi went on sale in Japan on October 21, 2009, in North America on December 1, 2009, and in Australia and New Zealand on May 11, 2010. It is the first mid-size Suzuki automobile sold in the Australian market. In February 2011, the Kizashi became available to the Indian market. From 2013 it is also available on European markets.
Name.
"Kizashi" is a Japanese word which means "something great is coming", "omen", "sign", or "warning", so it is possible Suzuki means to suggest to other automobile manufacturers that its Kizashi is an example of Suzuki's future products. The Kizashi aspires to be Suzuki's flagship sedan and currently exceeds Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement for cars classified as "compact".
Description and models.
Standard equipment includes front-wheel drive (FWD) and a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine developing and of torque. Available transmissions are a 6-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The CVT version reduces power to . The Kizashi offers 17 and 18-inch alloy wheels, Akebono sourced brakes, a choice of cloth or leather seating surfaces, and a 425-watt Rockford Fosgate audio system with iPod connectivity and Bluetooth capability. All-wheel drive (AWD) (based on the i-AWD system featured in the Suzuki SX-4) is optional and includes a driver-activated FWD mode to save fuel. The Kizashi has a 5 out of 5 star safety rating from ANCAP.
FWD is expected to be standard although an AWD option will be available for some models as well as a paddle-shift six-speed automatic. In December 2010, the Kizashi won two motoring awards in New Zealand: the Supreme Winner in the 2010 AA Motoring Excellence Awards and the "New Zealand Herald" Car of the Year Award. The car was praised for its astonishing attention to detail, refinement and comfort.
Kizashi in India.
Maruti Suzuki, 54.2% owned by Suzuki Motor Corporation, launched the Maruti Kizashi on 2 February 2011. It is imported as Completely Built Unit, which attracts import duties of 105%. It was priced at around 16 to 17.5 lakh rupees.It has now been withdrawn from the Indian market due to poor sales.
This model has a J24B 2.4 petrol engine with 4 cylinders, 16 valves DOHC. The 2400 cc engine is capable of producing 185 hp of peak power at 6,500 rpm (manual transmission) and 180 hp at 6,000 rpm (CVT). It produces 170 lb·ft of peak torque at 4,000 rpm. The Maruti Kizashi utilizes a direct ignition system for increased fuel efficiency with decreased emissions. With the help of this and other engine technologies, the car gives 9 km/L in the city and 12 km/L on the highway. The fuel tank capacity of the car is 63 L. Maruti Suzuki though, has not been able to sell many units since the Kizashi is petrol only (running a petrol car in India is expensive compared to a diesel), and the fact that it is expensive there.
Problems.
On June 28, 2010, Suzuki recalled 5,107 model year 2010 Kizashi vehicles due to a glove box door that failed to comply with FMVSS 201 ("Occupant Protection in Interior Impact") in which the door could open in a crash.
Concept versions.
2007–2008.
The first Kizashi concept included a 2L, 4-valve turbo diesel engine, sequential 6-speed transmission, 21-inch aluminium alloy wheels, and AWD — and was unveiled at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show.
The second Kizashi concept was a 5-door crossover sport wagon that included a V6 engine, 6-speed automatic transmission, i-AWD, and 265/45ZR22 tires — and was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show.
The third Kizashi concept was an AWD vehicle that included a V6 engine rated 300 hp, 6-speed automatic transmission, and 21-inch aluminium wheels with 255/30ZR21 tires. Concept Kizashi 3 was unveiled at the 2008 New York auto show.
2011 New York International Auto Show.
Aimed at performance enthusiast buyers and featuring; a new turbocharged engine outputting approximately , sports tires and wheels, and exterior paint job inspired by the company's motorcycles.
Suzuki’s hybrid is powered by a 2.0 L gasoline engine, which is “boosted” by a 15 kW belt-driven electric motor to deliver a combined 144 hp and 127 lb-ft of torque. The new hybrid drivetrain is further aided in its quest for improved fuel efficiency by a six-speed automatic transmission, low rolling resistance tires, regenerative braking, and stop-start technology, which add up to a significant mpg improvement compared to the current, “conventional” Suzuki. Steve Younan, director of automotive marketing and product planning for American Suzuki Motor Corporation, says that the company is making plans to move forward with a similar product, and that “the proof of (Suzuki’s) concept is that the Kizashi EcoCharge has the capability to deliver a 25 % fuel economy gain in real-world driving through an electric charge to the powertrain system while still retaining the production Kizashi’s dynamic handling and braking advantages that make it a standout category performer.”

An Essay on the Life and Genius of Samuel Johnson

An Essay on the Life and Genius of Samuel Johnson, LL. D. was written by Arthur Murphy and published in 1792. The work serves as a biography of Samuel Johnson and an introduction to his works included in the volume. Murphy also wrote a biography for Henry Fielding in a 1762 edition of his "Works" and a biography for David Garrick, the "Life of David Garrick", in 1801.
Background.
Murphy first met Johnson during the summer of 1754. Murphy was working on the "Gray's-Inn Journal" and, after discovering that a French article that they wanted to print was actually a translation of Johnson's "Rambler" No. 190, came to Johnson to apologize for his error. The two soon became friends, and Murphy began to tell the story many times later. Murphy was also friends with Henry Thrale and Hester Thrale, and spent time with all three.
After Johnson died and John Hawkins published his "Life of Samuel Johnson", Arthur Murphy began to attack the work. He used a "Monthly Review" piece to criticize the legalistic language employed by Hawkins to claim "that he is now rendered an incompetent critic thereby, and in consequence thereof".
It was first published in 1792 as a prefix to a 12 volumes octavo edition that included Johnson's "Works". This was done in a similar manner to Hawkins work which was prefixed to an eleven volume edition of Johnson's "Works". Murphy, at the beginning of his essay, claims, "The proprietors of Johnson's Works thought [Hawkin's] life, which they prefixed to their former edition, too unwieldy for republication". Murphy was paid 300 pounds for the "Essay".
Essay.
Murphy begins his essay by writing on the nature of biographical accounts:
"When the works of a great Writer, who has bequeathed to posterity a lasting legacy, are presented to the world, it is naturally expected, that some account of his life should accompany the edition. The Reader wishes to know as much as possible of the Author. The circumstances that attended him, the features of his private character, his conversation, and the means by which he rose to eminence, become the favourite objects of enquiry. curiousity is excited; and the admirer of his works is eager to know his private opinions, his course of study, the particularities of his conduct, and, above all, whether he pursued the wisdom which he recommends, and practised the virtue which his writings inspire. A principle of gratitude is awakened in every generous mind. For the entertainment and instruction which genius and diligence have provided for the world, men of refined and sensible tempers are ready to pay their tribute of praise, and even to form a posthumous friendship with the author.
In reviewing the life of such a writer, there is, besides a rule of justice to which the publick have an undoubted claim. Fond admiration and partial friendship should not be suffered to represent his virtues with exaggeration; nor should malignity be allowed, under a specious disguise, to magnify mere defects, the usual failing of human nature, into vice or gross deformity. The lights and shades of the character should be given; and, if this be done with a strict regard to truth, a just estimate of Dr. Johnson will afford a lesson perhaps as valuable as the moral doctrine that speaks with energy in every page of his works.
Before he begins, Murphy questions, "After so many essays and volumes of "Johnsoniana", what remains for the present writer? Perhaps, what has not been attempted; a short, yet full, a faithful, yet temperate history of Dr. Johnson".
Critical response.
Dr Campbell, an Irish clergyman, complained about the vulgarity of Murphy's recollections of Johnson's actions: "Murphy gave it - on Garrick;s authority - that when it was asked what was the greatest pleasure, Johnson answered f***ing, and the second was drinking. And therefore, he wondered why there were not more drunkards, for all could drink though all could not f***"

Michael David (painter)

Michael David, born Michael David Singer; born September 22, 1954, is an American-born American painter. Born in Reno, Nevada, David's family relocated to Brooklyn, New York, where he was raised. He attended SUNY Fredonia for one year and in 1976 received a B.F.A. from Parson's School of Design. David is classified as an abstract painter, best known for his use of the encaustic technique, which incorporates pigment with heated beeswax. He is also known for his works in mixed-media figure painting, photography and environmental sculpture. His work is included in the permanent public collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum and the Jewish Museum in New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others.
Plasmatics and late-1970s New York music scene.
In 1976 David, erotic photographer Roy Stuart and Fredonia friend Richie Stotts formed a band called The Numbers, with David on bass. The group was a fixture in New York's early punk rock music scene, playing in clubs alongside punk pioneers Television, Blondie and the Ramones. David also played bass with punk innovators Jerry Nolan of The New York Dolls, Cheetah Chrome of The Dead Boys, Marky Ramone, Peter Gordon, David Van Tieghem and the free-improvisation noise music group Borbetomagus.
In 1977, The Numbers were approached by impresario Rod Swenson, who was seeking musicians to form a backing band for singer Wendy O. Williams, whose radical persona he sought to exploit as punk music and performance art. The Numbers became The Plasmatics but the attention David began to gain as an important voice in the art world caused him to leave the band to pursue his burgeoning painting career.
Painting career.
David's first one-man show was in 1981 at the historic Sidney Janis Gallery. That year he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, at the time the youngest artist ever to do so, and in 1982 was awarded an American Academy of Arts and Letters prize. He went on to exhibit at galleries worldwide and was represented by Knoedler & Co. for the next 25 years.
David is best known for using the encaustic technique of painting, which uses pigment combined with heated beeswax. David built his early career on abstraction and religious iconography, which formed the bulk of his output until 1999. Since then he has also experimented with representational painting and traditional photography.
In 2000, he developed the "Chortens" and "Populations" series, about which prominent art historian and critic Donald Kuspit writes: "They are enigmatic works, all the more so because of the way their innumerable details form singularly monumental, intimidating wholes. Dense yet delicate, awesome yet intimate, they convey the fragility as well as grandeur of sheer being. Layer upon layer of paint piles up like layer upon layer of coral, but the textural result is more epic, not to say startling, than any coral island, and virtually any other existing abstract expressionist painting (upon which they are stylistically founded)." 
In 2001, David developed bi-lateral neuropathy due to being poisoned by gases released by overheated beeswax used in the encaustic process. The disease left him with partial paralysis of his legs, slowing the production of his painting for a number of years. That year, David began painting one of his best-known series, the "fallen Toreadors", inspired by 19th century French Realist painter Édouard Manet's "The Dead Toreador" of 1864. Of the series, David has said, "My work (became) about compassion. Compassion for those different from us, compassion for each other, and, most importantly, compassion for oneself, for a painter who was reckless enough to hurt himself doing what he loves most."
Photography.
In 1993, David experimented at the "20x24" Polaroid studio in Manhattan, which resulted in a series of portraits of playwright Edward Albee and of friend Jackie Gross, which would become the ongoing "Jackie" series of mixed-media works. When neuropathy rendered him unable to paint during 2003, he returned to the 20x24 camera and shot large-format Polaroids inspired by Caravaggio; nude men and women dressed as Toreadors, and religious imagery.
Environmental sculpture - The Greenhouse Project.
In 2002, David began to develop The Greenhouse Project, an evolving "architectural construct" based on historical American Antebellum greenhouses built using the actual glass negatives sold to starving farmers in the post-American Civil War South. David has indicated that each greenhouse will, through the display of photography and use of social networking, create a forum and exhibit for ideas and artifacts related to civil and human rights; the specifications of each greenhouse particular to the community in which each is built.
Critical response.
David's work was reviewed in "Artforum" and "Art in America", and is considered one of the last links to the New York School of painting. Art historian Donald Kuspit characterized David’s paintings in the following essay;
"Michael David’s abstract paintings renew immediacy, indeed, reconstitute, strengthen, and even apotheosize it. They raise it to a feverishly fresh intensity with their remarkable touch, indicating they are among the very best painterly abstractions made. To me they make it transparently clear that immediacy may be an illusion to the intellect but it is not one for the senses—for touch and sight, mingled together inextricably in ecstatic perception. For them, painterly immediacy is ultimate reality: pure sensuous intensity transcendent of ordinary, habitual understanding of the world, which is mediated by socially sanctioned language and banal meanings that force sense experience into their procrustean bed.
David may be the most innovative master of immediate surface since the abstract expressionists. He has acknowledged his debt to Abstract Expressionism, but he has transformed it. Where the abstract expressionist paintings of the forties and fifties seem like modern cave paintings, as their crude, unfocused, often meandering, turbulent painterliness suggests, and as such to reinstate prehistory, David seems to turn the cave into a temple, as his more considered, concentrated, indeed, dense, contemplative painterliness indicates, so that his paintings have the aura of post history. The sublime is gained with no loss of force—no sacrifice of painterly dynamics. Indeed, there is a gain in the sense of bodiliness: each of his works has a certain “body”—density of presence—so that it seems to embody the sublime, not simply evoke it. His paintings make the abstract sublime vividly concrete, as though it could be grasped rather than existed as some numinous beyond."

Split hand syndrome

In medicine, split hand syndrome is a neurological syndrome in which the hand muscles on the side of the thumb (lateral, thenar eminence) appear wasted, whereas the muscles on the side of the little finger (medial, hypothenar eminence) are spared. Anatomically, the abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous muscle are more wasted than the abductor digiti minimi.
If lesions affecting the branches of the ulnar nerve that run to the wasted muscles are excluded, the lesion is almost sure to be located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord at the C8-T1 level. It has been proposed as a relatively specific sign for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease). It can also occur in other disorders affecting the anterior horn, such as spinal muscular atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, poliomyelitis and progressive muscular atrophy. A slow onset and a lack of pain or sensorial symptoms are arguments against a lesion of the spinal root or plexus brachialis. To an extent, these features can also be seen in normal aging (although technically, the apparent muscle wasting is sarcopenia rather than atrophy).
The term split hand syndrome was first coined in 1994 by a researcher from the Cleveland Clinic called Asa J. Wilbourn.

Mumbles (district)

Mumbles is a district of Swansea, Wales located on the south east corner of the unitary authority area. It is a designated local government community made up of the electoral wards of Mayals, Newton, Oystermouth and West Cross. Mumbles has its own elected community council consisting of eighteen councillors. At the 2001 census the population was 16,774. The district is named after the headland of Mumbles which is located on the southeast corner of the district.
History.
Archaeological evidence indicates that an ancient submerged forest was located on what is now the foreshore of Mumbles Bay The bones of bears, wolves, hyenas, deer, rhinoceros and mammoth have been discovered there. A bone cave at the western tip of Caswell Bay was excavated in 1832 but has since been destroyed by the sea. Another cave, at the Inner Sound, Mumbles Head, was blown up by quarrymen in 1838 but not before elephant bones had been found. Also scattered around the bays of Mumbles and Gower are the bones of sixteen Ice Age mammals, including a mammoth tooth measuring ten centimetres across, which is on display in Swansea Museum.
The first human crop growers arrived in the area over 5, 000 years ago. However, evidence of human habitation is much older and possibly dates as far back as 30, 000 years ago - established by the dating of the famous Paviland skeleton located in a cave some 10-15 miles along the coast from Mumbles Head. The skeleton is kept in the Oxford Museum of Natural History, having been excavated by Rev William Buckland, who was Professor of Geology at Oxford University at the time. However, Swansea Museum has two well-finished flint axe-heads, one from Newton and one from an allotment on Mumbles Hill. Much of what we know about the first metalworkers, in the Bronze Age, has been learned from their tombs: pieces of pottery, a cairn and remains of a hut were found. The cliffs above the Redcliffe flats at Caswell Bay contain the ridged remnants of a Redley Cliff Iron Age hill-fort.
There is evidence that the Romans were based in Mumbles in a villa on the site of the present All Saints Church in Oystermouth. When the site was being extended in 1860, workmen removing a bank of earth on the south side of the original building accidentally broke up a Roman tessellated pavement, or mosaic floor. This was previously a pagan site, as were many sites of worship in the UK which subsequently became places of worship at the onset of Christianity. Indeed, in this area it has been reported that Romano British gentlemen of Roman Wales may have eaten oysters from the oysterbeds off the shore below the site at Oystermouth, or Ystumllwynarth. The Norman Castle at Oystermouth was built during the first half of the 12th century - one of many castles built in Gower as a defence against the native Welsh Princes who sought to re- claim the lands stolen by the Norman invaders. Royal Commission on Ancient & Historical Monuments in Wales, Glamorgan, The Early Castles, London, HMSO, 1991. The architectural merits of the church, castle and other buildings in Oystermouth are discussed in J.Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Glamorgan, London, Penguin/University of Wales Press, 1995.
Three of the bells in All Saints Church once belonged to the Jesuit church of La Compañía ("The Company") in Santiago, Chile. They seem to have been brought to Mumbles by Aubrey Vivian after the fire of 1863 burnt down the Jesuit church, killing 2,000 people. The family of industrialist Henry Vivian had business connections with the copper mines of Chile.
In 1793, the Mumbles Lighthouse was erected on the outer of the two tidal islands of Mumbles Head. In 1806, the Oystermouth Railway was built between Oystermouth and Swansea with the intention of carrying coal to Swansea. The potential for carrying passengers was soon seen and a horse-drawn railway passenger service was started on 25 March 1807, making it the first such service in the world. It became enormously popular and was commonly called 'the Mumbles train'. Following the development of the rail service, Mumbles became a popular tourist destination. To capitalise on this, the Mumbles railway was extended and a pier was constructed and opened in 1898 to serve as the new terminus. An RNLI lifeboat slipway was added to the pier in the summer of 1916 and a boathouse was finally built on it in 1922; these remain in use.
Mumbles was part of Oystermouth Urban District established in 1894, which was merged with the County Borough of Swansea in 1918. On 23 April 1947, the Mumbles lifeboat lost a crew of eight men while attempting to rescue the crew of the "Samtampa" that had run aground on Sker Point.
The Mumbles railway was closed in January 1960 and dismantled - a controversial decision that still resonates in the locality (calls to "bring back the Mumbles train" are still frequently heard and printed in local newspapers).
An amusement complex was developed at the land end of the Mumbles Pier in 1966, replacing an earlier popular dance hall. This proved to be a profitable attraction to visitors, resulting in the addition of a new building containing an amusement arcade, restaurant and bowling alley.
The 'Mumbles Mile' is a stretch of road in Mumbles once notable for its concentration of pubs. It has long been a popular destination for pub crawls and binge drinking. Famous poet Dylan Thomas was said to have enjoyed many hours at The Mermaid. The 'Mumbles Mile' began to decline in popularity during the 1990s because of pressure from the local council and increased competition from Swansea's night attractions. Now, there are only five pubs on the 'mile', whereas there were once upwards of 20.
The Encyclopedia of Wales says that Mumbles has always been considered a place apart... as the verse puts it:
The origin of the name "Mumbles" is obscure. Wyn Owen and Morgan (2008) cite several possibilities: Middle English "momele" ("to mumble"), describing the "mumbling" of the sea next to the rocks; Latin "mamillae" meaning "breasts", in reference to the breast shaped silhouette of the islands and headland, and Old Norse "múli" (snout, promontory).

In antiquity the territory was a part of Artsakh; in the Middle Ages it was part of the principality of Khachen; in the 17-18th centuries the territory formed part of Melik-Abovian dynasty's melikdom of Gulistan, with its capital in the fortress of that name. During Soviet times in the area was renamed after the Armenian Bolshevik Stepan Shahumyan, its administrative center taking the same name. By the 1990s the population of Shahumian district was almost exclusively Armenian by language and ethnicity, though the area was not included within the boundaries of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast by the Soviet Union. In the spring-summer of 1991, Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev ordered Operation Ring in which the Soviet Red Army surrounded some of the area's Armenian villages (notably Getashen and Martunashen) and violently deported their inhabitants to Armenia. Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in Shahumian's twenty-three villages were deported out of the region. In December 1991 with the Soviet Union imploding, Shahumian was claimed by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and became the focus for considerable fighting. This reached a climax in summer 1992 when most of the area was retaken by the Azerbaijan army. Damage was severe and the Armenian population fled.The historical name of the town of Shahumian was abolished and renamed to Aşağı Ağcakənd in 1992 and it has been partly re-populated by ethnic Azerbaijani refugees and internally displaced persons.
During Soviet times Aşağı Ağcakənd was officially named Shaumian after the Bolshevik leader Stepan Shahumyan. In December 1991 with the Soviet Union imploding, Shaumian was claimed by the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh Republic even though it had not fallen within the Soviet boundaries of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. It became the focus for considerable fighting which reached a climax in summer 1992 when most of the area was retaken by the Azerbaijan army. Damage was severe and the population, then predominantly ethnic-Armenian, fled.

Evans began his career in stage acting performing in many of London's West End productions such as "Rent", "Miss Saigon", and "Piaf" before getting his breakthrough role in Hollywood starring in 2010's "Clash of the Titans" remake, playing Apollo. Following his debut, Evans was cast in action and thriller films such as "Immortals", "The Raven" and played Aramis in the 2011 revamped adaptation of "The Three Musketeers". 
In 2013, Evans starred as Owen Shaw in "Fast & Furious 6". He is playing Bard the Bowman in Peter Jackson's three-part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit". Evans has been cast as the lead in the reboot of the comic book film "The Crow" and is slated to portray the vampire Count Dracula in the character's film origin story.
Early life.
Luke Evans was born and raised in Aberbargoed, a small town in the Rhymney Valley, Wales, the only child of Yvonne and David Evans. He was raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, though he left the religion when he was 16 and quit school at the same time.

From 2007 to 2008 Evans starred in many of London's West End productions including "La Cava", "Taboo", "Rent", "Miss Saigon" and "Avenue Q" as well as several fringe shows in London and at the Edinburgh Festival.
In 2008, he landed his most significant theatre role playing Vincent in the play "Small Change" written and directed by Peter Gill at the Donmar Warehouse, it was significant in that he gained recognition from film casting directors and US agencies from this play and he was also nominated for the Evening Standard award for best newcomer because of his performance in Small Change.

In 2011, he shot "No One Lives", a psychological horror film directed by Ryuhei Kitamara, in New Orleans, and began filming a role in Peter Jackson's three-part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit", playing the role of Bard the Bowman.
In 2013, Evans played the antagonist Owen Shaw in "Fast & Furious 6" and was cast as Eric Draven in the reboot of "The Crow" and Dracula in the reboot "Dracula Untold".
Personal life.
In a 2002 interview, Evans said, "Everybody knew me as a gay man, and in my life in London I never tried to hide it" and that by being open he would not have "that skeleton in the closet they can rattle out". In 2004, he said his acting career had not suffered by being out. In September 2010, Holly Goodchild, a female marketing expert said she was dating Evans: "Luke's lovely – we're really old friends and it just sort of happened... We are nowhere near engaged but things are really good."

Rus Borisi

Rus Borisi () is a village and municipality in the Goranboy Rayon of Azerbaijan.
History.
The village was founded in 1842, according to some sources or in 1893, according to others, by a group of Molokan settlers originally from central Russia. In 1932 a kolkhoz which functions to this day was established here, followed by the inclusion of the village in the Shahumian region. Historically the population was composed almost entirely of ethnic Russians and numbered over 2,000 people at its peak. In 1992, Rus Borisi happened to be in the thick of ethnic clashes between ethnic Armenians and Azeris, leading to a military operation and resulting in the mass exodus of the Armenians of Shahumian. The region itself was merged with the Goranboy region. Even though Rus Borisi, similarly to the Azeri villages of the region, remained unaffected by the military actions, the political and economic hardships forced a significant portion of the population of the village to leave for Russia. Beginning in 1994, the village was increasingly populated by ethnic Azeris, mainly internally displaced persons from Azerbaijan's Armenian-occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region.
As of 2006, according to the data provided by the executive power of the Goranboy region, the emigration of the ethnic Russian population was still in progress, and there were approximately 70 ethnic Russian families remaining in the village. In 2009, the population of Rus Borisi numbered about 500 persons, of whom only 83 were Russians, consisting mainly of middle-aged and elderly people.
The economy of the village is closely tied to the function of the Kalinin kolkhoz, considered a 'millionaire kolkhoz' back in the Soviet times. As of the late 1970s, it possessed 600 hectares of arable land, five poultry farms with 2,000 layers, a cattle farm of 300 milch cows and 800 head of young bulls and horses. In the 1990s the kolkhoz began functioning on a self-supporting basis, hence currently it only produces cabbage and potato. The village has an aid post and a secondary school with Russian as the language of instruction. The construction of the second Russian-language school intended for up to 180 pupils began in 2009.

Nativity! (film)

Nativity! is a British comedy directed by Debbie Isitt and released on 27 November 2009. The film stars Martin Freeman and Ashley Jensen. The film is written by its director, Debbie Isitt, but is also partially improvised.
The film premiered on 23 November 2009 in the SkyDome Arena, Coventry, England. It was released in cinemas on 27 November three weeks after rival festive film "Disney's A Christmas Carol" opened. It was met with surprisingly positive reviews and has built up a cult following. A sequel "" was released in 2012 and director Debbie Isitt has confirmed there will be a third, with filming starting in November 2013. 
Plot.
Paul Maddens (Martin Freeman) is a "frustrated, under-achieving primary school teacher" who once had ambitions of being successful as an actor, producer or director. Every year St. Bernadette's Catholic school, where he teaches, competes with a local Protestant private school (Oakmoor) to see who can produce the best nativity play. Maddens hates Christmas because his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lore (Ashley Jensen), who attended drama school with him, left him on Christmas before he could propose to her. Despite this, the St. Bernadette's headteacher Mrs Bevans (Pam Ferris) tasks him with running their nativity play this year, and gives him a new class teaching assistant called Mr Poppy (Marc Wootton), who turns out to be as much of a child as the rest of Mr Maddens's class.
Like every year, it is one of Maddens's other friends from drama school, Gordon Shakespeare (Jason Watkins), who runs the nativity plays at rival school Oakmoor. Determined not to be seen as a failure by his old rival, Maddens lies to Shakespeare about how a Hollywood producer—their old friend Jennifer—will be turning his production into a Hollywood film, though he hasn't even spoken to her in five years. Mr Poppy accidentally overhears this and is so excited that he has to spread the rumour. Soon Maddens finds his lie is out of control, and all he can do is go along with it as media attention mounts and the children get more and more excited.
Unfortunately, the St. Bernadette's children don't seem to be anywhere near as talented as Shakespeare's Oakmoor class, and Maddens finds it difficult to have confidence in their abilities. However, enthusiastic and childlike Mr Poppy helps him and the class to create an energetic, interesting nativity which showcases all of the children's unique—and often strange—talents. Meanwhile, Maddens tries to find a way to contact Jennifer to make the lie come true, even travelling to America to try to persuade Jennifer to visit. However, it turns out that she is only a secretary, not a film producer, and returns home disappointed.
Finally, amidst continuing media attention and the Mayor's kind offer to allow the play to be performed in Coventry Cathedral, Mrs Bevans discovers that the Hollywood story was a lie and cancels the play, advising Mr Maddens to start looking for another job. Resigned, Maddens shouts at Mr Poppy and blames him for many things that have gone wrong, but comes to his senses when facing his disappointed class and decides that the show must go on.
The play is performed at the cathedral to an audience of the children's parents and family friends, but there is no sign of any Hollywood producers, despite how good the play has turned out to be—and the fact that Mrs Bevans was initially furious to hear that her order had been ignored. Halfway through, jealous Gordon Shakespeare climbs on-stage to tell everybody that there is nobody from Hollywood there and the entire thing was a lie. Luckily, a helicopter flies over and Mr Poppy declares that it's Hollywood come to see the play—the show continues, and Jennifer and her film producer boss finally come in at the back to watch the end, joined by Mr Maddens, who is still in love with Jennifer and kisses her.
The play is a success, and everyone, including Shakespeare, is reunited onstage to celebrate the children's success. As the film closes, Mr Maddens and Jennifer are shown decorating his house together for Christmas, reunited at last.
Box office.
Only released in the UK so far, the movie opened at number 5 taking £794,314 at the UK box office. In its 3rd week the movie rose to number 4 and in the end made £5,187,402.

YouNoodle

YouNoodle is a San Francisco-based company, founded in 2010, building a platform for entrepreneurship competitions all over the world. YouNoodle matches entrepreneurs with competitions, accelerators, and startup programs, and provides a judging and voting SaaS platform to university, non-profit, government and enterprise clients organizing innovation challenges and competitions. Stanford's BASES, UC Berkeley's B-Plan, Start-Up Chile, Amazon Startup Challenge, and NASA are all running one or more competitions on YouNoodle's platform. 
History and structure.
YouNoodle was founded by Rebeca Hwang and Torsten Kolind in 2010. The company was spun off an ambitious project started by Bob Goodson and Kirill Makharinsky in 2007 with support from Peter Thiel (Founders Fund), Max Levchin (PayPal) and Charles Lho (Amicus Group), founding investor and Chairman of YouNoodle today. This project also spawned Quid (Goodson) and indirectly Ostrovok (Makharinsky). Although also named YouNoodle, this project/company was discontinued in 2010, when the three new entities started operations.
The founders of the 2007-2010 entity were Bob Goodson and Kirill Makharinsky, both former students of the University of Oxford. Goodson had studied medieval English literature before moving from Oxford to California when Max Levchin, the co-founder of Paypal, invited him to join a start-up there. Makharinsky's degree was in applied mathematics, and he was also encouraged to pursue opportunities in the United States by Levchin. Other significant employees included Rebeca Hwang (co-founder of today's YouNoodle), a Stanford University doctoral student whose research is into social network theory.
Startup predictor.
YouNoodle's now discontinued "Startup predictor", part of the 2007-2010 entity and developed by Makharinsky and Hwang, uses mathematical models to predict the success of new businesses. The user fills in a questionnaire, which takes about half an hour to complete and concentrates on the business' concept, finances, founders and advisers. Because the procedure is designed for very new companies, questions on revenue and traffic are not included. The site then provides an estimate of what the company's value will be after three years and a score from 1 to 1000 representing its value as an investment. The service is free for the startups themselves, but YouNoodle intends to charge third parties for access to the results. (The level of detail required by the questionnaire makes it difficult for people without inside knowledge of a company to provide the data for a prediction on their own.)
The company's founders have declined to explain the algorithm in detail, but state that it takes into account the entrepreneurs' experience, networks and mutual relations. Information provided by companies which use the site's networking features is used to improve the algorithm. As of August 2008, the algorithm was based on data from 3,000 startups. In the same month the company had four patents pending on the technology.

Inversive distance

Inversive distance (usually denoted as "δ") is a way of measuring the "distance" between two non-intersecting circles "α" and "β". If "α" and "β" are inverted with respect to a circle centered at one of the limiting points of the pencil of "α" and "β", then "α" and "β" will invert into concentric circles. If those concentric circles have radii "a'" and "b'", then the inversive distance is defined as
Alternatively, if "a" and "b" are the radii of "α" and "β" (as opposed to their images), and "c" is the distance between their centers, then the inversive distance "δ" may be calculated directly by the formula

Electoral district of Nollamara

Nollamara was an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia.
The district is based in the north-eastern suburbs of Perth. It includes the suburbs of Nollamara, Alexander Heights, Koondoola, Mirrabooka, Westminster and part of the suburb of Dianella.
Politically, Nollamara is a safe Labor seat. Based on the results of the 2005 state election, the electorate was created with a Labor Party majority of 69.3% to 30.7% versus the Liberal Party.
History.
The existing seat of Dianella was renamed Nollamara ahead of the 1983 state election, when a redistribution removed most of the suburb of Dianella to the neighbouring seat of Mount Lawley. Labor MP Rev Keith Wilson, member for Dianella since 1977, was successful at the election.
Under the 1988 redistribution effected at the 1989 state election, the seat moved further north and west, taking in the Labor strongholds of Balga, Western Australia, Mirrabooka and Westminster which had previously been in the abolished seat of Balga, while losing the northern part of Morley. Labor candidate John Kobelke won Nollamara, while Wilson successfully contested the new seat of Dianella, which was now centred on Dianella and Yokine.
Nollamara was abolished ahead of the 2005 state election. At its abolition, its territory included the suburbs of Nollamara and Westminster as well as parts of the suburbs of Balcatta, Balga, Dianella, Mirrabooka and Stirling. The district's territory was divided between the existing districts of Girrawheen and Yokine and the new seat of Balcatta. Kobelke subsequently contested and won the seat of Balcatta.
A new seat named Nollamara was created for the 2008 state election when the number of metropolitan seats was increased in accordance with the new one vote one value legislation. The new district was drawn from large parts of the electorates of Balcatta, Girrawheen and Yokine, the latter of which was abolished.
In November 2011, the Boundaries Commission announced that the seat would be abolished as of the 2013 state election. It was essentially replaced by the new seat of Mirrabooka, the name change necessitated by part of the namesake suburb going to the seat of Morley.
