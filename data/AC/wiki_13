Jolimont Yard

Jolimont Yard was an array of railway lines and carriage sidings on the edge of the central business district of Melbourne, Australia. Located between Flinders Street Station, Richmond Junction, the Yarra River and Flinders Street they were often criticised for cutting off the city from the river, being the site of many redevelopment proposals. The Princes Gate Towers (Gas and Fuel Buildings) were built over part of the yard in the 1960s, which themselves were replaced by Federation Square in the 1990s. The rail sidings themselves were progressively removed from the 1980s to the 1990s with only running lines today, but the area continues to be referred to as the 'Jolimont railyards' by Melburnians.
History.
The area of the Jolimont Yards had long been a site of railway development. Flinders Street Station was the terminal of the first railway in the city, running to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne). It was later joined by the independent Princes Bridge Station on the eastern side of Swanston Street, which served as the terminal for lines towards Richmond, South Yarra and Hawthorn. The two stations were not connected together until 1866, with Princes Bridge not reopening until 1879.
As time continued, the area between Princes Bridge and Richmond stations developed into a major yard for the stabling of suburban carriage stock, as well as the servicing of the steam locomotives that hauled them. Freight traffic was based out of Melbourne Yard and most of the country carriage stock was serviced at the Dudley Street sidings, both adjacent to Spencer Street Station. The running lines were arranged into pairs (inbound and outbound for each destination) with multiple sidings located between them.
In 1917 the Princes Bridge locomotive depot was closed, and replaced by the Jolimont Workshops. Built as part of the electrification of the Melbourne suburban network, it was the main storage, servicing and maintenance depot for the new fleet of suburban trains. The workshops was erected to the south along Batman Avenues, with the storage sidings located between the running lines. A footbridge ran from Flinders Street across the entire yard to provide access for train drivers.
An electrical substation was also erected to the south of the yard, to feed power into the overhead wires. Of 18,000 kilowatt capacity, it was fitted with four 4500 kilowatt rotary converters and was the largest substation on the network until demolished in the early 1970s to make room for the City Loop portals for the Caulfield Group. Additional sidings were also provided in the triangle formed by the lines bound for Richmond and Jolimont. Located on the site of the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, the ground was acquired by the Victorian Railways and the Essendon Football Club played their final season there in 1921.
The next major change was construction of the Richmond Flyover beginning in early 1970s. Part of the quadruplication works between Richmond and Burnley stations, it converts the up (inbound) - down (outbound) - up - down track layout at Flinders Street to an up - up - down - down track layout at Richmond and beyond. Completed in February 1973, it also permits a cross-platform interchange between City Loop and Flinders Street direct trains at Richmond on platforms 7/8 and 9/10. The flyover necessitated the reconstruction of a footbridge that linked Yarra Park to the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Further changes occurred when the City Loop was built. In addition to the relocation of the electrical substation, numerous tracks at Richmond Junction needed to be relocated to make room for the ramps descending into the tunnel, and tracks in the yard itself were slewed as work progressed on the cut and cover tunnels. The Metrol train control complex was also constructed beside the yards on Batman Avenue, to control the loop as well as to replace the five Flinders Street signal boxes. During construction the public discovered that the building would block the view from Russell Street to the Botanic Gardens and Government House, and that it had occurred due to no planning permit being applied for. State Premier Rupert Hamer responded to public outrage and instructed the half built building to be demolished, and instructed all government departments that they must apply for planning permits, whether they were legally needed or not. The building was redesigned to be lower and resulting in completion being delayed until early 1980.
Past elements.
Workshops.
The Jolimont Workshops were the main maintenance and repair facility for the Victorian Railways electric fleet, both multiple units and locomotives. Located on the south side of the yard, it was made up of a large brick carshed with tracks leading into if from both the east (Richmond) and west (Flinders Street) ends. In addition to the maintenance of the suburban multiple unit fleet, the E class suburban freight and L class mainline electric locomotives were maintained there until the 1960s. 
Signal boxes.
Five signal boxes controlled traffic into Flinders Street Station. Later replaced by Metrol, four of them were located in Jolimont Yard:
Flinders Street B was located at the Richmond end of Flinders Street platform 8/9 and controlled the southern tracks into and out of the station from Jolimont Yard. Constructed of brick it was of 'traditional' Victorian Railways design, and was demolished when the Federation Square Deck was built.
Flinders Street C was located beyond the Richmond end of Flinders Street platform 4/5 and controlled the northern tracks into and out of the station from the yard. Constructed of brick it was of 'traditional' Victorian Railways design, and was demolished when the Federation Square Deck was built.
Flinders Street D was located at the Richmond end of the Princes Bridge Station island platform (later renumber to Flinders Street 15/16). Of utilitarian brick construction it remains in place today just outside the Federation Square Deck, but is unused as a signal box.
Flinders Street E was located at Richmond Junction, and controlled the junction as well as access into the Richmond end of the stabling sidings. Of utilitarian brick construction it remains in place today underneath the William Barak Bridge, but is unused as a signal box.
Footbridges.
During the heyday of the yard only two footbridges crossed the yard:
Only the first bridge remains today, the other bridges being recent additions.
Redevelopment plans.
Over the years, various redevelopment plans for Jolimont Yard have been proposed by various parties, including:
1925: Cathedral Square
In 1925 a design competition was held by the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects for redevelopment of the rail yard. The winner was James Smith with his proposal set back from the street line, featuring a paved civic plaza and fountain, railway offices, tourist bureau and a concourse to Princes Bridge station.
1929: Metropolitan Town Planning Commission
The Metropolitan Town Planning Commission was created in 1922 and was chaired by City of Melbourne councillor and architect Frank Stapley. The initial report included a city square over the yard between Flinders Street and Batman Avenue, running east from Princes Bridge, but was later dropped as unsuitable due to cost and traffic congestion.
1954: MMBW Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme
The MMBW commenced their Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme in 1949. This scheme involved redeveloping the Yarra River frontage, partially roofing the rail yards, constructing a bridge from Russell Street to Batman Avenue, and building underpasses below Princes Bridge and Batman Avenue.
1958: Kenneth McDonald
This plan was proposed by Kenneth MacDonald and Associates to the City of Melbourne, and proposed the roofing of the rail yards between Swanston and Spring Streets, with public space, shops, car parking, apartment and hotel towers, a theatre and an office tower built above.
1961: Matthew Flinders Square
This proposal was put promoted by ex Lord Mayor William Lempriere and was prepared by architects Montgomery, King and Trengrove. It aimed to fix the "desecration of the city's southern gateway by the rail yards," and the "'mid-Victorian monstrosity" of Flinders Street Station by roofing the rail yards and relocating the railway station underground. The open space on either side of Princes Bridge would be the home of a new Town Hall, a civic square, concert auditoriums, the railways administration, and other commercial buildings.
1963: Princes Gate
Announced in 1963 by Premier Henry Bolte, the Â£5 million project would roof part of the yard and build a plaza and two 15-storey buildings on this structure. Completed in 1967 and commonly known as the Gas and Fuel building, the Princes Gate towers were demolished in 1996-1997.
1973: Jolimont Pleasure Gardens
A City of Melbourne proposal for roofing the yards and reconnect the city with the river and sports and arts precincts beyond.
1979: Landmark Competition
Premier Rupert Hamer announced a $100,000 competition for designs to roof the remainder of Jolimont Yard. Over 2300 entries were submitted, with 48 finalists selected by a committee chaired by Ron Walker. No overall winner was chosen, a composite scheme with a tower in a garden setting recommended instead. Each of the finalists receiving a little over $2000 prize money, with designs including hanging gardens, an underwater gallery, a free-standing escalator, a series of 12 transparent arches, a solar-powered earth beam, a Freedom Bird Park, and a Time Tower.
1985: Denton Corker Marshall
By the architecture firm, the Princes Plaza Proposal included demolition of one of the Princes Gate towers, and the construction of a large street level plaza stretching across the yards, and a new building to the east surrounding a formal garden.
1996: Federation Square
A design completion for the site commenced in 1996, resulting in Federation Square that was opened in October 2002.
Rationalisation.
The first area of the yard to be removed was the 'Collingwood Sidings' in the northern corner, near the intersection of Wellington Parade South and Jolimont Road. The area was cleared of tracks during 1987 and 1988 and was offered for sale as a development site. Purchased by a company that later collapsed, it was not until the mid-1990s that the present apartment buildings have been built. High-rise apartments featured in the final stage, that ran into opposition in the early 2000s, but was approved in 2005.
The State Government announced the Federation Square project in 1996, along with additional development of the sports and entertainment precinct and new parklands. Rationalisation of the yard was carried out in 1997-1998 to clear the way, with the stabling sidings and workshops removed and replaced by new facilities located elsewhere, including:
The track rationalisation itself cost $40 million with 53 operating lines between Flinders Street and Richmond were reduced to just 12. The number of points was also reduced, from 164 to 48 and 1 in 9 and 1 in 15 points were used to permit higher speeds. New lower profile masts were installed to support the overhead wiring, and a new electrical substation erected to supply power to the trains. The main area of new track was between Flinders Street Station, Richmond Junction and the City Loop portals. 
Piling works and crash walls for Federation Square were done by October 1998. The deck was completed by mid-1999, with building works atop of it commencing in August 1999. The removal of other buildings along Batman Avenue was carried out at this time, including the Metrol train control facility. Opened at the time of the City Loop opening in 1981, it was moved to a temporary location pending the replacement of the elderly technology with a new system.
The Exhibition Street Extension was also built, connecting the CBD to Batman Avenue and Swan Street, permitting the closure of Batman Avenue for Federation Square and Birrarung Marr. Tolled as part of the CityLink project, it was opened in 1998 and carries trams and four lanes of traffic. By June 1999 the route 70 tram had been rerouted from Swan Street to a new section of reserved track running between the Tennis Centre and the remaining railway lines, entering the CBD via the Exhibition Street Extension rather than Batman Avenue. A new footbridge from the Multi Purpose Stadium to the MCG Great Southern Stand concourse was built, and existing footbridge from the MCG Pontsford Stand to Scotch Oval was rebuilt and widened.
As part of the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games the 525-metre long William Barak footbridge was built east-west from Birrarung Marr to Yarra Park. Stated in 2005 and opened in 2006. The bridge is yet to be completed, with scaffolding and formwork still attached to the piers.
Today.
Twelve tracks run though the area today, in six pairs named (from north to south):
Where the lines interconnect outside the MCG was originally known as Jolimont Junction, but was renamed Richmond Junction following the demise of the yard.
From Flinders Street in the west to Richmond Station in the east, bridges over the area include:
On 28 April 2008 Premier John Brumby announced that his government was proposing a multi-million dollar development to link the sports and arts precincts in Melbourne's CBD. To be funded by a public-private partnership, the railway lines would be roofed and commercial buildings built on top. The next day the Victorian Employers' Chamber of Commerce and Industry urged the roofing over the railway lines east of Federation Square for the construction of a residence for the Prime Minister of Australia, and as well as for hosting visiting heads of state and business delegations.
In August 2009 the VECCI again brought up the topic of roofing over the railway tracks, an article in "The Age" cited that an 2002 costing of $1.4 billion.

Turn Back the Clock (film)

Turn Back the Clock (1933) is an MGM comedy-drama film directed by Edgar Selwyn, written by Edgar Selwyn and Ben Hecht, and starring Lee Tracy (while under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer). The film also stars Mae Clarke. The Three Stooges featuring Curly Howard appear in an uncredited straight role as wedding singers. There is a small gag wherein Lee Tracy asks the Stooges to sing "Joe's Wife", a song the Stooges have not heard of; Moe Howard then asks "Who's Joe's wife?"
Although they are not credited as the Three Stooges (indeed, they receive no screen credit at all), this marks the first time the trio appeared as a group on film without their former leader, Ted Healy. They would launch their long-running film-shorts career a few months later.
Plot summary.
Joe Gimlet (Lee Tracy) is a middle-aged, middle-class man dissatisfied with his life. After being hit by a car and then going under full anethesia in a hospital operating room, Joe presumably "wakes up" to discover that he's been transported twenty years into the past to the time of the horse and buggy. After "reliving" his life and going through many trials and tribulations, he awakens in his hospital bed relieved, telling his wife that he wouldn't change a thing about their actual life together.
Cultural references.
This film features a fictitious version of Henry Ford named Henry Cord asking Lee Tracy to accompany him in his $300 motor car.

Hopley Yeaton (1739 â May 14, 1812) was the first officer commissioned (March 21, 1791) under the Constitution of the United States by George Washington into the Revenue Marine, (later known as the Revenue Cutter Service) which was one of the forerunners of the modern day United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard was later created when the United States Congress merged the Revenue Cutter Service with the US Lifesaving Service in 1915.
Yeaton was a veteran of the Continental Navy and the commanding officer of the Revenue Marine cutter "Scammel". Yeaton probably brought along his slave, Senegal, during the Scammel's patrols as was this practice was permitted by the Treasury Department at this time. Yeaton fired three of his crew after their first few months of service. The men had been in "open rebellion" over issues of pay and daily food rationsâparticularly after they learned that their fellow sailors on board the "Massachusetts" received more and varied foods each day than they did.

The tomb of the first commissioned officer of the Revenue Marine, Hopley Yeaton, now lies on the Academy's grounds. He was originally buried in Lubec, Maine, but in 1975 his burial site was threatened by modernization. The Corps of Cadets sailed the barque "Eagle" to Lubec where his remains were exhumed and laid to rest at the Academy.

Van Kampen diagram

In the mathematical area of geometric group theory, a van Kampen diagram is a planar diagram used to represent the fact that a particular word in the generators of a group given by a group presentation represents the identity element in that group.
History.
The notion of a van Kampen diagram was introduced by Egbert van Kampen in 1933. This paper appeared in the same issue of American Journal of Mathematics as another paper of van Kampen, where he proved what is now known as the Seifertâvan Kampen theorem. The main result of the paper on van Kampen diagrams, now known as the "van Kampen lemma" can be deduced from the Seifertâvan Kampen theorem by applying the latter to the presentation complex of a group. However, van Kampen did not notice it at the time and this fact was only made explicit much later (see, e.g.). Van Kampen diagrams remained an underutilized tool in group theory for about thirty years, until the advent of the small cancellation theory in the 1960s, where van Kampen diagrams play a central role. Currently van Kampen diagrams are a standard tool in geometric group theory. They are used, in particular, for the study of isoperimetric functions in groups, and their various generalizations such as isodiametric functions, filling length functions, and so on.
Formal definition.
The definitions and notations below largely follow Lyndon and Schupp.
Let 
be a group presentation where all "r"â"R" are cyclically reduced words in the free group "F"("A"). The alphabet "A" and the set of defining relations "R" are often assumed to be finite, which corresponds to a finite group presentation, but this assumption is not necessary for the general definition of a van Kampen diagram. Let "R"â be the "symmetrized closure" of "R", that is, let "R"â be obtained from "R" by adding all cyclic permutations of elements of "R" and of their inverses. 
A van Kampen diagram over the presentation (â ) is a planar finite cell complex formula_2, given with a specific embedding formula_3 with the following additional data and satisfying the following additional properties:
Thus the 1-skeleton of formula_2 is a finite connected planar graph "Î" embedded in formula_9 and the two-cells of formula_2 are precisely the bounded complementary regions for this graph. 
By the choice of "R"â Condition 4 is equivalent to requiring that for each region of formula_2 there is some boundary vertex of that region and some choice of direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) such that the boundary label of the region read from that vertex and in that direction is freely reduced and belongs to "R". 
A van Kampen diagram formula_2 also has the "boundary cycle", denoted formula_13, which is an edge-path in the graph "Î" corresponding to going around formula_2 once in the clockwise direction along the boundary of the unbounded complementary region of "Î", starting and ending at the base-vertex of formula_2. The label of that boundary cycle is a word "w" in the alphabet "A"Â âªÂ "A"â1 (which is not necessarily freely reduced) that is called the "boundary label" of formula_2.
Further terminology.
In general, a van Kampen diagram has a "cactus-like" structure where one or more disk-components joined by (possibly degenerate) arcs, see the figure below:
Example.
The following figure shows an example of a van Kampen diagram for the free abelian group of rank two
The boundary label of this diagram is the word
The area of this diagram is equal to 8.
van Kampen lemma.
A key basic result in the theory is the so-called "van Kampen lemma" which states the following:
Sketch of the proof.
First observe that for an element "w"Â âÂ "F"("A") we have "w"Â =Â 1 in "G" if and only if "w" belongs to the normal closure of "R" in "F"("A") that is, if and only if w can be represented as
where "n"Â â¥Â 0 and where "si"Â âÂ "R"â for "i"Â =Â 1,Â ...,Â "n".
Part 1 of van Kampen's lemma is proved by induction on the area of formula_2. The inductive step consists in "peeling" off one of the boundary regions of formula_2 to get a van Kampen diagram formula_36 with boundary cycle "w"' and observing that in "F"("A") we have 
where "s"â"R"â is the boundary cycle of the region that was removed to get formula_36 from formula_2.
The proof of part 2 of van Kampen's lemma is more involved. First, it is easy to see that if "w" is freely reduced and "w"Â =Â 1 in "G" there exists some van Kampen diagram formula_40 with boundary label "w"0 such that "w"Â =Â "w"0 in "F"("A") (after possibly freely reducing "w"0). Namely consider a representation of "w" of the form (â ) above. Then make formula_40 to be a wedge of "n" "lollipops" with "stems" labeled by "ui" and with the "candys" (2-cells) labelled by "si". Then the boundary label of formula_40 is a word "w"0 such that "w"Â =Â "w"0 in "F"("A"). However, it is possible that the word "w"0 is not freely reduced. One then starts performing "folding" moves to get a sequence of van Kampen diagrams formula_43 by making their boundary labels more and more freely reduced and making sure that at each step the boundary label of each diagram in the sequence is equal to "w" in "F"("A"). The sequence terminates in a finite number of steps with a van Kampen diagram formula_44 whose boundary label is freely reduced and thus equal to "w" as a word. The diagram formula_44 may not be reduced. If that happens, we can remove the reduction pairs from this diagram by a simple surgery operation without affecting the boundary label. Eventually this produces a reduced van Kampen diagram formula_2 whose boundary cycle is freely reduced and equal to "w".
Strengthened version of van Kampen's lemma.
Moreover, the above proof shows that the conclusion of van Kampen's lemma can be strengthened as follows. Part 1 can be strengthened to say that if formula_2 is a van Kampen diagram of area "n" with boundary label "w" then there exists a representation (â ) for "w" as a product in "F"("A") of exactly "n" conjugates of elements of "R"â. Part 2 can be strengthened to say that if "w" is freely reduced and admits a representation (â ) as a product in "F"("A") of "n" conjugates of elements of "R"â then there exists a reduced van Kampen diagram with boundary label "w" and of area "at most" "n".
Dehn functions and isoperimetric functions.
Area of a word representing the identity.
Let "w"Â âÂ "F"("A") be such that "w"Â =Â 1 in "G". Then the "area" of "w", denoted Area("w"), is defined as the minimum of the areas of all van Kampen diagrams with boundary labels "w" (van Kampen's lemma says that at least one such diagram exists).
One can show that the area of "w" can be equivalently defined as the smallest "n"â¥0 such that there exists a representation (â ) expressing "w" as a product in "F"("A") of "n" conjugates of the defining relators.
Isoperimetric functions and Dehn functions.
A nonnegative monotone nondecreasing function "f"("n") is said to be an "isoperimetric function" for presentation (â ) if for every freely reduced word "w" such that "w"Â =Â 1 in "G" we have
where |"w"| is the length of the word "w". 
Suppose now that the alphabet "A" in (â ) is finite.
Then the "Dehn function" of (â ) is defined as

Human (Brandy Norwood album)

Human is the fifth studio album by American recording artist Brandy Norwood, first released in France in December 2008 and by March 2009 in most international music markets. Distributed by Koch Records and Sony Music, the album marked Norwood's debut on the Epic Records label, following her split with Atlantic Records in 2005, and her reunion with long-time contributor and mentor Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, who wrote and executive produced most of the album with his songwriting collective.
Generally well received by critics, "Human" debuted at number fifteen on the US "Billboard" 200 with opening week sales of 73,000 copies, becoming the singer's lowest-charting debut since her first album fourteen years prior. With a domestic sales total of 214,000 copies, it widely failed to revive the success of its predecessors. While leading single "Right Here (Departed)" scored Norwood her biggest chart success since 2002's "Full Moon," the album failed to impact elsewhere, resulting into lackluster sales in general and the release of just one other single, "Long Distance."
In mid-2009 during the recording sessions for Norwood's second album with Epic Records, the singer ended her management contract with Roc Nation. This was followed by the termination of her contract with Epic, after singer-songwriter Amanda Ghost was appointed the new president of the label. Disappointed by its performance, Norwood later expressed her dislike of the album itself.
Background.
Brandy Norwood released her fourth studio album "Afrodisiac" in June 2004, amidst the well-publicized termination of her short-lived business relationship with record executive and entertainment manager Benny Medina. Norwood ended her contract with his Los Angeles-based Handprint Entertainment after less than a year of representation following controversies surrounding Medina's handling of the lead single "Talk About Our Love", and failed negotiations of a purported co-headlining tour with fellow R&B singer Usher. Despite the negative publicity, "Afrodisiac" emerged as Norwood's most critically acclaimed album by then, but became a moderate seller on most music markets. The album debuted at number three on the "Billboard" 200 albums chart but while it went on to sell more than 416,000 copies in the United States, it generally failed to chart or sell noticeably elsewhere. Kanye West-produced "Talk About Our Love" reached number six on the UK Singles Chart but later singles such as "Afrodisiac" and "Who Is She 2 U" failed to score successfully on the popular music charts and promotion for the album soon ended.
At the end of 2004, after eleven years with the company, Norwood asked for and received an unconditional release from her original label Atlantic Records. 
By the time her contract expired, several of her longtime patrons such as music producer Darryl Williams and industry executive Sylvia Rhone had left the company and Norwood felt mismanaged by her new team of which she found was "looking more towards the hip-hop artists" on the label and "didnât know what to do with ." Completing her contract with Atlantic Records, a compilation album compiling her first four studio albums with the company, entitled "The Best of Brandy", was released in March 2005. Thereupon, Norwood reportedly started shopping for a new record deal under Knockout Entertainment, her brother's Ray J's vanity label, which would co-venture her subsequent releases, including her fifth album, which she started recording independently.
Recording and conception.
Norwood began recording the album in 2005. Breaking away from her usual formula which saw her setting up projects with former main producers such as Keith Crouch, Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins and Timbaland, she entered the studio with several songwriters and producers to record new music, including Louis Winding and Frederik Tao from Danish production team Maximum Risk. The duo produced several songs for Norwood, including both "Honey" and "Sweet Nothings", all of which were penned by frequent collaborator Kenisha Pratt. Over the following months, Norwood continued recording contract-free with a vast of producers such as Rockwilder and production duo Tim & Bob who finished several demos with her. Norwood's new management also arranged further recording sessions with fellow client Bryan Michael Cox and his production partners Adonis Shropshire and WyldCard at the Track Record Studios in North Hollywood. Supposed to produce her whole album at the time, they worked on a number of ballads and midtempo songs reminiscent of their other productions, including a song called "Cry". In June 2006, Cox announced that he would serve as the album's executive producer, but direction changes resulting from additional sessions left his songs unused.
In December 2006, Norwood was involved in a fatal automobile accident on Los Angeles' San Diego (405) Freeway. The accident claimed the life of the 38-year-old driver of a Toyota that was struck by Norwood's Range Rover. Norwood was neither arrested nor charged with vehicular manslaughter due to insufficient evidence. Nevertheless, multiple lawsuits were filed against Norwood, all of which were ultimately settled out of court by her civil attorney. Posing an extraordinary hardship for the singer and her family, Norwood stepped down from her role as a judge on the second season of the amateur talent contest "America's Got Talent" and went into hiatus. Expanding on dealing with the aftermath of the tragedy, Norwood explained, "I just wanted people to know that this wasn't news. It's not something that should be talked about like it's gossip. You don't like me? Fine. But don't use this situation to try to hurt me, because the guilt of being involved is enough. It's something that I'll never truly, truly get over." While the accident put a halt on the album's production, Norwood soon resumed recording which she found to be therapeutical: "I had to face it and find the strength to move forward. Connecting back with music has definitely helped me through everything. Once I got back in the studio, the butterflies went away."
With most of the album being revamped, other musicians joined the project, including Midi Mafia, RedOne, Toby Gad, Frank Ocean, and Brian Kennedy, the latter of which was consulted to replace Cox as the album's executive producer. Together, they crafted a bunch of new songs, including "Freedom", "One Thing" and "Today" which Norwood later described as sounding "more true to the sound" that she had initially envisioned for the album. However, in early 2008, her A&R manager, Brandon Creed, presented Norwood several demo tracks that were produced by Rodney Jerkins, including "Right Here (Departed)". Her former main producer on previous albums such as "Never Say Never" (1998) and "Full Moon" (2002), Jerkins hadn't worked with Norwood since 2002, due to conflicting schedules and a disagreement on her decision to work with Timbaland on "Afrodisiac" in 2003. Again, the album was reconstructed, with Jerkins taking over executive duties. On her decision to collaborate with Jerkins, Norwood commented: "With Rodney being the person who produced first single, I, of course, wanted to go from there because of our history and all the music we have made in the past. It felt like the right thing to do [...] I wanted to see where that chemistry would take us creatively this time round." With Jerkins on board, providing the bulk of "Human", the sound of the album shifted drastically, with Norwood and her team abandoning most R&B records in favour of his international pop sounds.
Norwood inked a new record deal with Epic Records in April 2008 and intended to finish the album by September of the same year. Although the record company announced the US release of the album for November 11, a call by Timbaland, who requested Norwood to record additional music with him and protegÃ©s J-Roc and James Fauntleroy, caused another month-long delay of "Human". His tracks did however also not make the final cut on the album track listing as he was unable to contribute trademark backing vocals to his songs. In addition to Timbaland, Norwood worked with producers Rico Love, Blac Elvis, Rob Knox, The Clutch, and songwriters Chasity Nwagbara, Kara DioGuardi, and Greg Curtis on "Human", although their songs remain yet unreleased on any format. Further studio collaborations with Kerry "Krucial" Brothers, Missy Elliott, Yung Berg, and Tonex, by contrast, failed to materialize due to scheduling conflicts.
Content.
Introduced by the words of Brandy's description of a human being on "Human Intro," the album opens with Jerkins-crafted "The Definition," one of the few uptempo recordings on the album. Penned by Atlanta writer Crystal Johnson, the song depicts the singer rhapsodizing about love. It received generally mixed reviews, with "The Boston Globe" emphasizing it the most essential track on "Human". "Warm It Up (With Love)," another Darkchild production, was created around a piano sample and released to strong positive reactions. Highlighted by AllMusic and "Slant Magazine", "Newsday" writer Glenn Gamboa noted it as "guiding principle" on the album. Lead single "Right Here (Departed)" was not recorded until late into the production of "Human" and the first song Brandy recorded with Jerkins following their musical reunification in early June 2008. Written by The Writing Camp and recorded with therapeutical background, the track chronicles a woman's talks about mutual support with loved ones. It reached number-one on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play chart, number 22 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and the top ten of the French Singles Chart, becoming the singer's biggest chart success in years. Fifth track "Piano Man" was recorded as an ode to the kind of creative relationship cultivated by a vocalist and his or her producer or DJ.
"Long Distance," a ballad about the difficulties of a long-distance relationship, was released to positive reactions by critics, with "The New York Times" calling it an "hymnlike single that distantly echoes Janet Jacksonâs "Again." Eighth track "Camouflage," one out of two songs on the album that were penned by songwriter Claude Kelly, garnered strong reviews in general, with "Newsday" declaring it a "worthy cousin to BeyoncÃ©'s 'Irreplaceable' that more about esteem-raising and self-improvement than a search for a sassy put-down." "Torn Down," a joint production by Midi Mafia and Dapo Torimiro, was one of the few prominent "Human" features on the setlist of Brandy's promotional 2009 concert tour, Human World Tour. Incorporating elements of country music, critics noted it a "resolute, crisp mix of static synths, acoustic guitar, and hand claps." Brandy wrote the album's title track with help from producer Toby Gad and Canadian singer Esthero. A "silky R&B anthem" as described by "Newsday", the adult contemporary ballad deals with forgiveness. "Shattered Heart" is a downbeat track, that incorporates elements of Middle Eastern music and changes its tempo after three minutes. It has been described as the only "Timbo-esque" record on "Human".
The album's twelfth track, a piano-driven ballad entitled "True," was contributed by RedOne and Claude Kelly and initially written for Michael Jackson. The song was re-arranged and partially re-written to fit Norwood's persona. It was released to positive reviews by critics, who noted it one of the stronger tracks on "Human". "A Capella (Something's Missing)," produced by Soundz, is a near-a cappella song on which Brandy provides "a polyphonic cyberchorus" with multiple tracks of her own voice. Humming the bassline and providing the rhythm, the instrumentation on the track consists of a sole electric guitar. Hand-clap-laden uptempo recording "1st & Love," the album's fourteenth track, depicts a woman's euphoria with a new-found love at first sight and was discussed as the third single at times. Final track "Fall," another piano ballad, was co-written by label mate Natasha Bedingfield. As reported Brandy and Bedingfield were forced to delay their first joint recording session from Atlanta, Georgia to Los Angeles, California as singer Chris Brown and his entourage crashed into the studio, where they blasted Brown's songs and horsed around.
Release and promotion.
Norwood revealed the title of the album as well as the name of several new songs in a press statement from August 15, 2008. Named after its title track, which she co-wrote, Norwood stated, "itâs called "Human" because thatâs what I am and at the end of the day we all are only human. The album speaks for itself." Further elaborating on the title, the statement uttered that the title was "a real life mirror of Brandy as a woman, an artist, a musician and a performer, communicating what it means to be fully "Human": strong yet vulnerable, candid and triumphant, in love with life and in touch with the things of the spirit." During a promotional tour in support of the album, Norwood stopped by BETâs "106 & Park" to perform a five-piece mini-concert that featured the first two singles from the album in addition to "What About Us?", "Full Moon" (2002) and "Almost Doesn't Count" (1999). In addition, she launched the worldwide release of the album on "Good Morning America" with an interview and a performance of "Right Here (Departed)". Throughout December, Norwood appeared on other television shows such as "The Tyra Banks Show" and CW11â²s "Morning Show". In support of the album, the singer was also featured on a November cover of American weekly "Jet".
In collaboration with Sony Music and RCA Records, "Human" was first released in France through Epic Records on December 5, 2008. On December 8, it was released in Australia and the United Kingdom, and the following day, it was released in North America, where it was distributed by Koch Records. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition through digital media stores; in addition to the original track listing, it features five additional songs, including bonus tracks "Gonna Find My Love" and "Locket (Locked In Love)" and remixes of "Right Here (Departed)" and "Long Distance", the latter of which feature contribution by English DJ Moto Blanco and Jamaican American rapper Sean Kingston. Elsewhere, "Human" was not released until February 2009. In Japan, Sony Music Japan released the deluxe edition along with a 3-track bonus DVD, including music videos and the making of "Right Here (Departed)".
Singles.
"Right Here (Departed)" was released on September 9, 2008, as the album's lead single. While it charted moderately successful in the US, where it reached number 34 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, elsewhere, the track became Norwood's highest-charting single in years, reaching the top ten of the French Singles Chart, and top twenty on the Japan Hot 100. In addition, "Right Here (Departed)" became Norwood's first entry to top the "Billboard"s Hot Dance Club Play chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Little X and filmed in Los Angeles, California in August 2008. it reached number one on BET's "106 & Park" countdown amd was voted number 69 on "" Top 100 videos of 2008.
Second and final US single "Long Distance" was released on November 11, 2008. The track managed to peak at number 38 on the "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart but failed to enter the Hot 100; it however became the album's second consecutive number-one hit on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Upon its television debut, Chris Robinson-directed music video came in at number nine on the "106 & Park" countdown on December 22, 2008, and peaked at the top position in January 2009. Upon album release, "The Definition" and "True" reached number sixteen and eighteen
on the "Billboard" Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart, respecitvely, based on downloads only. While Norwood considered both, "Piano Man" and "1st & Love", as potential third single candidates, plans for another single from "Human" failed to materialize.
Tour.
After a small promotional tour in the fall of 2008, which saw her perform at music festivals, Norwood embarked on a tour of individual concert shows in February 2009 to promote the album. As well as singing songs from "Human", Norwood also performed songs from her previous albums "Brandy", "Never Say Never", "Full Moon" and "Afrodisiac", a set that was largely inspired by her "Brandy: Just Human" BET concert special, broadcast on December 5, 2008 on the network. The tour began in Athens, Ohio on February 7, 2009, and concluded in Okmulgee, Oklahoma on June 19, 2009; some concerts were part of annual events such as the Milwaukee Pridefest and the San Jose Pride. Selected venues featured supporting appearances by Colby O'Donis, Ray J, Bell X1, and Samsaya.
Reception.
Critical response.
While "Human" became Norwood's first effort not to be nominated for a Grammy Award in any category, it received generally favorable reviews from music critics, averaging a 67 out of a 100 among averaged reviews on Metacritic. Sarah Rodman of "The Boston Globe" complimented the album as appropriately rich and varied: "It's better than good enough. It's a light, breezy listen that shows off Brandy's resilience, humility, joy, and vibrancy." She especially highlighted Jerkins' input on the album: "Jerkins manages to bring out the expressive best in her pleasantly raspy vocalizing." "The Guardian" writer Alex Macpherson noted "Human" "a thoughtful, intimate work on which Norwood sings movingly about fragility and fear," giving it four and a half stars out of five, while Andy Kellman of AllMusic called the album Norwood's "most platitudinal" and "least enjoyable release in her catalog," adding: "Brandy is clearly in a comfort zone that enables her to open up more than ever [...] "Human" is nothing if not a serious album. But it could very well be her most useful one." He gave the album three and half stars out of five. "Billboard" magazine said that "while "Human" is missing the sassy Brandy we know and love from such tracks like 'I Wanna Be Down' and 'Talk About Our Love,' we can still appreciate the much-needed solace of setting personal turmoil to memorable music."
Jon Dolan, writing for "Blender", gave the album three out of five stars and commended Norwood's decision to re-team with Jerkins: "Now sheâs gone back to girlie hip-hop Eden; four songs were written by Jerkins, author of her best late-â90s hits. Fluttery jams about long distance longing and time-suspending slow dances are balanced by grown-up moments of deeply felt, if slightly weird, balladic fortitude." Jon Pareles from "The New York Times" felt that the sentiments of the songs, whether self-affirming or heartbroken, were back to generic ones: "Song titles like 'Torn Down' and 'Shattered Heart' show how much Brandy is trying to get serious, taking on an adult world where happily ever after is elusive. But she still comes across as a fledgling, a personality still being formed, eagerly tagging along after her role models." In his review for "Entertainment Weekly", Henry Goldblatt noted "the huskiness that defined Brandy's prior work has been replaced by wispier and higher tones. The result is pleasant but far less ambitious than her last CD, 2004's "Afrodisiac"." Mikael Wood's review for "Los Angeles Times" was less emphatic. He gave the album one and a half stars out of four, and said: "Unfortunately, it's also hard to make it through the thing. Brandy's strong suit has never been her thoughtfulness; appropriately for someone with her Hollywood history, she's long been one of R&B's emptiest vessels, a gorgeous voice used by a series of gifted producers to communicate their own unique ideas."
Commercial performance.
The week after its domestic release, "Human" debuted at number five on the US "Billboard"'s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and at number fifteen on the official "Billboard" 200 chart, with moderately successful first week sales of 73,000 copies â about half as much as her previous effort album "Afrodisiac". As it failed to climb any higher, the album became Norwood's second-lowest charting effort in the US behind her self-titled debut album (1994) which had reached the number 20 position fourteen years prior. In addition, it reached number six on the "Billboard" Top Digital Albums chart. Altogether, the album sold 214,000 copies in the US. While lead single "Right Here (Departed)" became Norwood's highest-charting single success in years throughout Europe, "Human" widely underperformed overseas, failing to enter most national music charts. It however, reached the top fifty of the Belgian Albums Chart, and made it to the top 200 of the French Albums Chart.
Promotion on the album ended soon after its December release and Norwood subsequently started work on a second album with Epic Records. Amongst those to record with the singer were songwriting and production partners Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Brian Kennedy. Expressing her dissatisfaction with "Human"s chart performance, she told "Blues & Soul" magazine she was "a little disappointed about that" but added: "At the same time, Iâm also pleased that Sony has given me another chance to do another project that I feel theyâre totally behind. In hindsight I do feel the last album was a little political. So a lotta changes have been made since "Human" â and hopefully theyâre changes for the better! Because, having got all the deep stuff off my chest, Iâm now able to really tap into the fun part of music again [...] itâs exactly the type of album that I need to be makiing right now!â
In mid-2009, Epic ended their contract with Norwood following the appointment of Amanda Ghost, making "Human" her only album with the label. A "Los Angeles Times" article later revealed Norwood's discontent with the success of the project the following year when asked about the commercial failure of "Human": "It was lacking my belief in it. It lacked my vision. Pretty much bottom line, if you donât believe in something itâs not going to go," she said. "So do I believe that "Human" was as creative as "Never Say Never" and "Full Moon"? No, I do not. You definitely want to put something out thatâs like that. I felt at the same time I could have had much better songs and a much better set-up." A statement she made during a 2010 interview with "Out" magazine turned out more harsh: "To hell with that album! [...] Where I felt creatively it couldâve gone and the space I was in creatively, I needed everybody around me to be in that same space. It wouldâve been a different album, but with the same inspiration and same blessing for other people. It wouldâve been hotter music and a hotter look." Blaming herself for the albumâs commercial results, Norwood dismissed the album as âtoo pop.â The debut season of her 2010 VH1 reality series "" further revealed that the album's underperformance resulted into another argument between her and executive producer Rodney Jerkins, whose commitment to the project Brandy felt not as "creative and forthcoming" as on previous albums and that he purposefully did not put his best work in the album. Jerkins had distanced himself from the project following its official release, declaring his dissatisfaction with the involvement of other producers on the album.

Aimol people

Aimol are a people in India, settled in different regions in different districts of Manipur and some in Assam and Nagaland. Some people live in Senapati district and Churachandpur district. Most of them are found in Chandel in the South-Eastern part of Manipur. The Aimol Tribe was recognized by the Ministry of Home Affairs on 29/10/1956. They are neither Kuki nor Naga Tribes of Manipur. There are nine villages of Aimol.
The Aimol speak the Aimol language which is a Tibeto-Burman, Kuki-Chin language and akin to Faihriem language. The Aimol number about 6,500. They practice slash and burn agriculture and are primarily Christian.
Origin.
It is difficult to trace the very origin of the people. Here are some traditions which relates to the origin of the people which has been sang in the form of folklores and told as folktales to their children by their parents from generation to generation.
I. A Cave: The people came out of a big cave so they considered themselves cavemen and cavewomen. According to the tradition, many people of this tribe lived inside a cave and whoever came out of the cave for hunting or foraging, was killed by a tiger that laid in wait at the mouth of the cave. Thus the tiger killed many persons of this community. The population of this tribe alarmingly decreased. At last, a very brave woman began to ponder and wove a cloth of the same colour of that tiger. A very brave man of the cavemen wore the so woven cloth by the woman and the man came out of the cave. The tiger took him for a tigress and did not attack the man. So the man killed the tiger with his spear and sword. Thus the people could come out of the cave and began to sojourn to some safer places. The woman who could weave such beautiful clothes was widely known. The traditional cloth of the colour of that tiger is called âPonchialâ which is still considered as one of the precious and valuable gifts of a bride of Aimol and she presents this traditional shawl to her father in law in a marriage ceremony of a son.
Roung leh Waisua: According to this tradition, the people came from Roung leh waisua. The meaning of âroungâ is a deep gorge or valley situated between two hills or mountains and âWaisuaâ means a river. The people came along the river which was a sepantile and full of dangerous snakes and animals. They followed the river toward north in the hope of getting a better settlement. It is believed that the sun was appeared from the southern side of the place â ruong leh waisua. Upon the consequence of this tradition, they believed that they came from the south.
Raim leh waisua: The meaning of Riam is tribals and Waisua means the crowd. According to this traditional view that the people had lived in a group of tribals or people. It has been said that this people could no longer live among such group of people. So they came out of this place towards north in the expectation of discovering a better and favourable place for their inhabitation. They had marked on a tree locally known as mook and planted plantain wherever they went and sojourned. They told the people who were left in the group of the people to identify the earmark marked on the mook tree (mook kung) and the plantain planted to follow them. It is believed that the Aimol people lived at a place known as Khokhengjol and khodamjo and later moved to Rungrelbung.
Etymology.
The term "Aimol" or "Aimawl" means a talisman or spells of magic chanted to causes a black magic or causes an effect upon the person who is wanted by the owner of talismans. "Aimol" or "aimawl" is like a black ginger or a group such gingers and "mol" or "mawl" means a plain or a valley on a top of a hill or a mountain. The other meaning of "Ai" is crab and "mual" is valley. It is also said that the people were well known for their "doi" (magic) and even the Meitei King was afraid of their doi and invited a man for his doi. Therefore, Ai was grown wherever they lived as this was paramount important things for their rituals. The then the king of Manipur, Chandrakirti paid a royal visit to Saivom during his reign (1851â86). The kings of Manipur were quite familiar with the Aimol people.

Dexter Drumlin

Dexter Drumlin, formerly known as Kilbourn Hill, is a drumlin and a 38 acre (15 ha) open space reservation in Lancaster, Massachusetts. The reservation includes a small tributary of the Nashua River and is managed by The Trustees of Reservations. It is characterized by managed, open fields and offers scenic views of surrounding rural Lancaster.
History.
As glaciers retreated from what is now the New England landscape, distinctive hills were formed. When the last glacier moved across the New England landscape over 10,000 years ago, it formed distinctively-shaped hills called "drumlins" running parallel to the path of the ancient ice flow. Dexter Drumlin is "a classic example"
Ecology.
The reservation consists of hayfield, transitional meadow, and wetlands. The stream that runs along the western side of the hill forms wet meadows in lower terrain. Grassland bird species nest and raise their young on the hill and in the adjacent floodplains.
Researchers at Fitchburg State College have used the reservation as a place to study the mating displays of male fireflies. Using specially-designed devices to mimic the fireflies bioluminescence, the researchers found that the courtship flashes of "Photinus ignitus" males attracts both competitors and predators.
Recreation.
Dexter Drumlin is open to hiking, picnicing, crosscountry skiing, mountain biking, sledding, and kite flying. A one-mile (1.6Â km) long mowed, path passes over the crest of the drumlin and along the Nashua River tributary. The property has been used for kite flying events. Rock collectors may discover "sacred crosses" of chiastolite of a type considered to be of spiritual value by the Algonquian peoples who once dominated the region.
The reservation trailhead is located on George Hill Road across from Browning Elementary School in Lancaster.

Frank D'Angelo

Frank D'Angelo (born April 23, 1959 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian entrepreneur in the beverage industry. He is the founder of D'Angelo Brands and Steelback Brewery and is host to "The Being Frank Show", a weekly Canadian, infomercial, talk show.
Early life.
D'Angelo was born to Italian immigrants Giuseppe and Carmela D'Angelo in Toronto. He showed a knack for business early on; at age 9 he outsourced his newspaper delivery of the Toronto Telegram to other children. He held many sales positions (sometimes concurrently), and bought his first house at age 20, which he flipped profitably.
D'Angelo's beginning in the food industry started when he worked for his father who owned Napoli foods until they were sold to Saputo a year later.
Businesses.
D'Angelo Brands, Inc..
D'Angelo is founder and president of D'Angelo Brands, Inc., which produces and markets beverages and some canned food items in Canada. It started in 1986 by selling apple juice door-to-door, and the company quickly grew to success with the financial backing of Canadian politician Al Palladini. He grew his company after a chance encounter with David Stewart, the CEO of the Loblaws supermarket chain. They filed for credit protection in late 2007. On February 16, 2008, a numbered company owned by D'Angelo's family bought back D'Angelo Brands.
Steelback Brewery.
In September, 2002, he started and was the CEO for Steelback Brewery. He was replaced after their financial problems in late 2007. As of 2010, the Steelback Brewery is closed.
Forget About It Supper Club.
D'Angelo owns the Forget About It Supper Club restaurant on King Street in Toronto, Ontario.
Cheetah Power Surge.
Cheetah Power Surge is an energy drink produced by D'Angelo Brands.
Marketing.
Steelback commercials from 2002 to 2007 always starred Frank D'Angelo and presented him as a known celebrity (although he was relatively unknown) and the face of Steelback. He has said that "I am the Brand". Steelback invested around $15M per year on advertising.
The low budget ads were often shown in high-cost slots during Hockey Night In Canada broadcasts. Hockey related spots starred him and hockey celebrities such as Shayne Corson, Darcy Tucker and Phil Esposito. In one commercial, he interviewed Ben Johnson in a pretend talk show titled 'Being Frank'.
Entertainment and charity.
D'Angelo is the singer for his band called the Steelback 2â4, which includes Mike Reno from Loverboy. Their first album is "You Gotta Believe to Believe" to raise funds for victims of Hurricane Katrina, the Breast Cancer Society and the Hospital for Sick Children. On May 21, 2009, they announced the release of their second album "Full Circle" with nine original songs and four cover tunes.
He has frequently sung the opening anthems at Toronto Argonauts games.
He released a recording of Silent Night in November, 2009, with an RnB vocal style. Profits from sales went to support Toronto charities which help the homeless.
Frank has also been an active volunteer to help the city's homeless.
Sport.
On December 18, 2006, D'Angelo declared his interest in buying the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team.
In 2007, D'Angelo expressed interest in reviving the Canadian Football League's Ottawa Renegades (with the intention of naming them the Ottawa Steelbacks), but the league rejected him as an owner, with media speculating it was because he was "egotistical" and a "shameless publicity hound".
The Being Frank Show.
In November 2010, D'Angelo purchased time on a number of stations to launch his "The being Frank Show". It is broadcast Fridays at 1 a.m. The first show was on 5 November 2010 on CHCH in Hamilton, Ontario. The show is interspersed with 'Commercial Timeouts' promoting his related products as well as other products. Airtime has been purchased on various Canadian television stations.
Controversy.
Sexual assault charge.
On June 9, 2007, D'Angelo was arrested in the alleged sexual assault of a 21-year old woman. He was found not guilty on April 21, 2009.
Several days after being acquitted, D'Angelo hosted a party at his Forget About It Supper Club. An Ontario Provincial Police surveillance team took photographs showing veteran Ontario Provincial Police sergeant Michael Rutigliano, and two crown attorneys, Richard Bennett and Domenic Basile present at the same celebration.
On May 14, Rutigliano was charged with attempting to influence the outcome of the case. He was accused of conspiring with D'Angelo to obstruct the prosecution of the case. D'Angelo was formally charged the next day with conspiring to obstruct justice and obstructing justice. He was to appear in court on June 8, 2009, in Brampton, and his case was adjourned until May 31, 2010. On September 2, 2010, the obstruction charges against D'Angelo were stayed.

Unrelated, also in June, 2007, D'Angelo launched a $2M libel suit against blogger Neate Sager for a posting on Sager's blog site. D'Angelo dropped the suit when Sager posted an apology.

Samuel Lapham VI

Samuel Lapham VI was born on 23 September 1892 in Charleston, South Carolina to Samuel Lapham V and Annie Grey Soule (a direct descendant of Pilgrim George Soule). He attended the University School of Charleston (which became the Gaud School in 1908, his senior year), College of Charleston graduating in 1913 with a BA, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1916 with a Bachelors of Architecture.
After MIT Lapham worked for Fay, Spofford & Thorndike in Boston including work with Adams Cram. In 1917, Lapham moved to Akron, Ohio taking a position with Carmichael Construction Company until the outbreak of the U.S. role in World War I. He applied by mail and joined a South Carolina unit. He attended Officer's Training Camp at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia and Fortress Monroe in Virginia. During the war he served at Fort Moultire in Charleston and the 61st Artillery Brigade, 1st Army, American Expeditionary Forces in France. Upon discharge he joined C.F. Warner of Cleveland, Ohio before returning to Charleston to partner with Albert Simons in 1920.
He joined the Army Reserve serving in the Coastal Artillery starting in 1923. During World War II he was assigned to the Inspector General Office in Atlanta where he inspected construction of bases from Cuba to Kentucky including the secret work at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
The architectural firm of Simons & Lapham was influential in creating the first historic preservation ordinance in Charleston, South Carolina in 1930. The firm worked on preservation projects in South Carolina and Georgia starting in the 1920s. They were honorary life members of the Society for the Preservation of Historic Dwellings of Charleston (now the Preservation Society of Charleston). They also performed new construction. During the expanse of the work the firm did over 300 projects from 1920-1972. The firm changed names over the years: Simons & Lapham; Simons, Lapham, Mitchell & Small; Simons, Mitchell, Small & Donahue; Mitchell, Small, Donahue & Logan; and Mitchell, Small & Donahue. The latter was in business as late as 2007.
Lapham was active in community service. He was a founding member of the South Carolina Society of Colonial Wars and designed their official seal. He was also a member of Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks Lodge #242 (a lodge his father re organized), Carolina Yacht Club, The Charleston Club, Landmark Lodge #76 Ancient and Free Masons, Kiwanis Club, Saint Cecilia Society, Delta Lodge of Scottish Rite. He was a charter member of the South Carolina Mayflower Society. He joined the American Institute of Architects in 1923 serving as state president in 1936-1937. He was elected a Fellow in 1937 and Member Emeritus in 1955.
Lapham married Lydia LaRoache Thomas in July 1926. They had Anne Soule Lapham (1929â2002), Samuel Thomas Lapham (1935â1943) and Samuel Peyre Lapham (living). Samuel Lapham VI is buried with his wife in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston, South Carolina.

Henry I, Count of Anhalt

Henry I, Count of Anhalt ( 1170 â 1252) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and Count of Anhalt.
He was the oldest son of Bernhard III, Duke of Saxony and Count of Anhalt, by his wife Brigitte, a daughter of Canute V of Denmark.
After the death of his father in 1212, the surviving sons of the late duke divided his lands according to the laws of the House of Ascania: Henry received Anhalt and the younger Albert the Saxon duchy. In 1218 Henry was raised to the rank of prince (German: "FÃ¼rst").
Henry's most famous "ministerialis" (bondsman) was Eike von Repgow from Reppichau, who compiled the "Sachsenspiegel", the most important legal code of the German Middle Ages.
Henry also was a renowned "MinnesÃ¤nger". At the beginning of 14th century, five of his "Minnelieder" (love songs) were copied into the Codex Manesse, an exceptionally beautiful collection. In this source, he is erroneously referred to as a "duke".
Before his death, Henry divided Anhalt between his sons: Henry inherited Aschersleben, Bernhard received Bernburg, and Siegfried took Zerbst. His other surviving sons, Hermann and Magnus, were ordained priests.
Marriage and issue.
Ca. 1211 Henry married Irmgard (b. ca. 1197 â d. ca. 1244), daughter of Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia and second cousin of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor through her paternal grandmother Judith of Swabia. They had eleven children:

<doc id="18872386" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18872386" title="Pre-Columbian savannas of North America">
Pre-Columbian savannas of North America

Pre-Columbian savannas once existed across North America. These were created and maintained in a fire ecology by Native Americans until the 16th century death of most Native people. Surviving natives continued using fire to clear savanna until European colonists began colonizing the eastern seaboard two hundred years later. Many colonists continued the practice of burning to clear underbrush, reinforced by their similar experience in Europe, but some land reverted to forest.
Postglacial events.
During the Last Glacial Maximum about 18,000 years ago, the influence of Arctic air masses and boreal vegetation extended to about 33Â° N. latitude, the approximate latitude of Birmingham and Atlanta. Southeastern forests of the glacial period were dominated by various spruce species and jack pine; fir was abundant in some locations. With the exception of the absence of certain prairie elements, the understories of these forests were generally typical of modern spruce-fir forests within and near Canada. Humans spread across the continent as five thousand years passed following the retreat of the glaciers, while deciduous forests expanded northward. In the east, pockets of boreal elements remained only at high elevations in the Appalachian Mountains and in a few other refuges.
Warming and drying during the Holocene climatic optimum began about 9,000 years ago and affected the vegetation of the southeast. Extensive expansions of prairies and savannas occurred throughout the southeast, and xeric oak and oak-hickory forest types proliferated. Cooler-climate species migrated northward and upward in elevation. This retreat caused a proportional increase in pine-dominated forests in the Appalachians. The grasslands and savannas of the time expanded and were also linked to the great interior plains grasslands to the west of the region. As a result, elements of the prairie flora became established throughout the region, first by simple migration, but then also by invading disjunct openings (including glades and barrens) that were forming in the canopy of more mesic forests.
At about 4,000 years BP, the Archaic Indian cultures began practicing agriculture. Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common, and the small-scale felling of trees became feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire in a widespread manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was taken up to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories, thereby making travel easier and facilitating the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants that were important for both food and medicines. The result in many regions was "the conversion of forest to grassland, savanna, scrub, open woodland, and forest with grassy openings". After the death of 90% of the native population around 500 years ago, grasslands, savanna, and woodlands succeeded to closed forest.
Historic or remaining savanna areas.
Savanna surrounded much of the continent's central tallgrass prairie and shortgrass prairie. Fire also swept the Rocky Mountains aspen as frequently as every ten years, creating large areas of parkland. In the far southwest was California oak woodland and Ponderosa Pine savanna, while further north was the Oregon White Oak savanna. The Central Hardwood Region covers a wide belt from northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, down through Iowa, Illinois, northern and central Missouri, eastern Kansas, and central Oklahoma to north-central Texas, with isolated pockets further east around the Great Lakes. The Eastern savannas of the United States extended further east to the Atlantic seaboard.
In the southeast, longleaf pine dominated the savanna and open-floored forests which once covered from Virginia to Texas. These covered 36% of the region's land and 52% of the upland areas. Of this, less than 1% of the unaltered forest still stands.
In the Eastern Deciduous Forest, frequent fires kept open Kentucky bluegrass areas which supported herds of bison. A substantial portion of this forest was extensively burned by agricultural Native Americans. Annual burning created many large oaks and white pines with little understory.
The Southeastern Pine Region, from Texas to Virginia, is characterized by longleaf, slash, loblolly, shortleaf, and sand pines. Lightning and humans burned the understory of longleaf pine every 1 to 15 years from Archaic periods until widespread fire suppression practices were adopted in the 1930s. Burning to manage wildlife habitat did continue and was a common practice by 1950. Longleaf pine dominated the coastal plains until the early 1900s, where loblolly and slash pines now dominate.
At low altitudes in the Rocky Mountain region, large areas of Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir had an open park-like structure until the 1900s. In California's Sierra Nevada area, frequent fires kept clear the understory of stands of both Ponderosa pines and giant Sequoia.
Destruction of the savannas.
Industrialized sawmills in the early 20th Century cleared many tall savanna old-growth trees, while fire suppression methods adopted in the 1930s and 1940s stopped much of the regular burning which the savanna required. By the latter half of the 20th Century many researchers had rediscovered both the prehistoric use of fire and methods to practice burning, but by then almost all prairie and savanna lands had been converted to agriculture or succeeded to full-canopy forest. Modern conservation of savanna includes controlled burning, and at present about a year are burned.

Forward Markets Commission (India)

The Forward Markets Commission (FMC) is the chief regulator of forwards and futures markets in India. As of March 2009, it regulated Rs 52Â trillion worth of commodity trades in India. It is headquartered in Mumbai and this financial regulatory agency is overseen by the Ministry of Finance. Mr. Ramesh Abhishek replaced Mr. B.C. Khatua as the interim chairman of the commission in 2011. FMC is now in the middle of a big storm for its regulatory role in NSEL Scam
Chairman of FMC.
Mr. Ramesh Abhishek is the Chairman of commodities regulator FMC. He is an IAS Officer of 1982 Batch (Bihar Cadre) and was appointed on 24 September 2012 as the Chairman of Forward Market Commission. Mr. Abhishek, an alumnus of the Harvard Business School, holds post graduate degrees in public administration and international relations. His role in handling NSEL scam is being questioned as the settlement plan he approved has failed miserably.
History.
Established in 1953 under the provisions of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952, it consists of two to four members, all appointed by the Indian Government. Currently, the Commission allows commodity trading in 22 exchanges in India, of which 6 are national.
From 2013 september 09, the commission is overseen by the Ministry of Finance. Since futures traded in India are traditionally on food commodities, earlier it was overseen by Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution (India).
Development of the Industry.
India has a long history of trading commodities and considered the pioneer in some forms of derivatives trading. The first derivative market was set up in 1875 in Mumbai, where cotton futures was traded. This was followed by establishment of futures markets in edible oilseeds complex, raw jute and jute goods and bullion. This became an active industry with volumes reported to be large.
However, in 1935 a law was passed allowing the government to in part restrict and directly control food production (Defence of India Act, 1935). This included the ability to restrict or ban the trading in derivatives on those food commodities. Post independence, in the 1950s, India continued to struggle with feeding its population and the government increasingly restricting trading in food commodities. Just at the time the FMC was established, the government felt that derivative markets increased speculation which led to increased costs and price instabilities. And in 1953 finally prohibited options and futures trading altogether.
The industry was pushed underground and the prohibition meant that development and expansion came to a halt. In the 1970 as futures and options markets began to develop in the rest of the world, Indian derivatives markets were left behind. The apprehensions about the role of speculation, particularly in the conditions of scarcity, prompted the Government to continue the prohibition well into the 1980s.
The result of the period of prohibition left India with a large number of small and isolated regional futures markets. The futures markets were dispersed and fragmented, with separate trading communities in different regions with little contact with one another. The exchanges had not yet embrace modern technology or modern business practices.
Next to the officially approved exchanges, there were also many havala markets. Most of these unofficial commodity exchanges have operated for many decades. Some unofficial markets trade 20â30 times the volume of the "official" futures exchanges. They offer not only futures, but also option contracts. Transaction costs are low, and they attract many speculators and the smaller hedgers. Absence of regulation and proper clearing arrangements, however, meant that these markets were mostly "regulated" by the reputation of the main players.
Responsibilities and functions.
The functions of the Forward Markets Commission are as follows:
It allows futures trading in 23 Fibers and Manufacturers, 15 spices, 44 edible oils, 6 pulses, 4 energy products, single vegetable, 20 metal futures, 33 others Futures.
The commission appeared in the news in March 2012 for their controversial ban on guar gum futures trading after it said the price quadrupled due to its use in fracking causing food inflation.

Occupation of Poti

The Raid on Poti was a series of Russian strikes against the Georgian port of Poti during the 2008 South Ossetian War in August 2008. The city was later occupied by Russian troops, who remained for some time before eventually withdrawing.
Background.
Poti is one of Georgia's main ports on the Black Sea. There are also Georgian military air bases around the city. A major oil pipeline delivering oil to Europe also passes through here. As such it was an area where considerable Russian effort was made during the war.
Battle.
Initial Air and Sea Attacks.
The Russian air force bombed the port and its facilities on August 9, attacking both the port and a nearby airbase.
Capture of Senaki.
The town of Senaki which is several miles inland from the port was captured by Russian Forces on August 11. Thus Poti was effectively cut off as the only major road linking it with the rest of Georgia passes through Senaki. Two Georgian helicopters taking off from Senaki airbase were also shot down. Although the Russians withdrew a day later, the action demonstrated the general helplessness and the inability of the Georgians to resist.
Occupation.
On August 14 it was reported by elements of the media that Russian troops had occupied the city, and that Georgian naval vessels had been sunk, although it was not immediately clear whether this was accomplished by land, air or naval forces.
On August 19, 2008, Russian troops captured 22 Georgian soldiers and seized four American Humvees in the port city.
Aftermath.
The UNOSAT carried out the analysis of satellite pictures of Poti on August 25, 2009. Six submerged Georgian boats were identified, while no other damage was visible in the city.

Indrechtach mac Lethlobair

Indrechtach mac Lethlobair (died 741) was a Dal nAraide king of the Cruithne in Ulaid (Ulster). He was the son of Lethlobar mac Echach (died 709), a previous king. He belonged to the main ruling dynasty of the Dal nAraide known as the UÃ­ ChÃ³elbad based in Mag Line, east of Antrim town in modern county Antrim. 
It is uncertain at what date he acquired the kingship of Dal nAraide. The death of Dub dÃ¡ Inber mac Congalaig as King of Cruithne( the title used for them at this time in the annals) is recorded in 727. Indrechtach is also listed before Cathussach mac Ailello (died 749) in the king lists but it is possible that Cathussach resigned the kingship to Indrechtach upon becoming King of Ulaid in 735. This would place his reign as 735-741.
Professor Byrne, however, believes that there may have been an interregnum in Ulaid between 735-750. This would give a possible reign for Indrechtach over the Dal nAraide from 727-741 if this were true and would explain his placing in the king lists of the Dal nAraide.
His son Tommaltach mac Indrechtaig (died 790) was a King of Dal nAraide and of all Ulaid.

Nij, Azerbaijan

The town of Nij (also, Nidzh), located forty kilometers south west of Qabala in Azerbaijan, is the only settlement of Udi people in the world. It has a population of 5,744.
History.
The forefathers of the Udi people were members of one of the twenty six Caucasian Albanian tribes who played an important role in the creation of the state of Caucasian Albania, which was situated in Azerbaijan and in the southern territories of Daghestan (currently in the Russian Federation) in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.
Ancient Udi was the principal language of Caucasian Albania. The Udi tribe was described in the writings of Herodotus, Strabo and Pliny the Elder. According to these chroniclers, the Udis became politically active following their involvement in the military incursions into Greece of Persian Emperor Xerxes I.
They are the only ethnic minority retaining their affiliation to Christianity in Azerbaijan. The Caucasian Albanian-Udi Apostolic Autocephalous Church is located in Nij. The Udi language is a North Caucasian language. Modern Udis are bilingual in both Udi and the Azeri language.
During the 5thâ9th centuries, Christians in Caucasian Albania used the Caucasian Albanian alphabet. As a result of the later political weakening of the State of Caucasian Albania and the Caucasian Albanian Catholicate, the script gradually faded out, and subsequently its usage was discontinued. Currently, the Udi Alphabet uses 52 letters.
The first Udi school and then, subsequently, a Russian rural school, was opened in Nij in 1854. Subsequently a Russian rural school was established. From 1931 to 1933, Udis received education in their own language; in 1937 they began to receive education in the Azeri language.
The settlement of Nij is a unique district, with its unusual planning lay out, transport systems, and its public, private and religious buildings. Nij is also a unique place, as various ethnic and religious groups co-existed throughout the centuries. The settlement of Nij is divided into several quarters, based on the family relationships of its residents. Practically all the names of these quarters are in the Azeri language - such as Hajibayli, Darabag, Daramahla, Vazirli, Farimli, Malbel, Agdamekli, Melikli, Falshyly, Manjyly, Delekli, Chirmakhli and Abdally.
As in their past, Udis are today involved in a variety of vocations, which include farming, cattle breeding, rice cultivation, sericulture, horticulture, poultry farming, craftsmanship and viticulture. Many Udi ceremonies, rites, and calendar days of the Udis are linked to farming.
Traditional ceremonies, rites, beliefs and traditions are the integral elements of an intangible cultural heritage. This is mostly reflected in the names and observance of national holidays. One such holiday is called "Comrad", and is celebrated near a church, whereby, according to the tradition, the sacrifice of a black sheep is required. It is worth noting that this rite is similar to the Gurban Holiday (Eid al-Adha) â a sacred holiday of Islam, widely celebrated by Azerbaijanis. One of the popular holidays of the Udi people is "Zhogulun Akhsibay", celebrated on the arrival of Spring. On that day, each family cooks a meal called "kherse", paints eggs and jumps over bonfires. Many elements of this holiday are similar to those of the Novruz (Spring) Holiday of Azerbaijan.
These unique features of the Udisâ cultural heritage have, in the past, been observed by many scholars and travelers who visited Nij. Throughout the 19th century, information about the Udis, and particularly their language, was studied and published by Russian and Western researchers. Alexander Dumas, the French writer, in his book "Tales of the Caucasus", provides detailed information about the specific economic activities, language and culture of the Udis living in Nij.

Occupation of Gori

The Battle of Gori was fought over Gori and its surrounding villages by Russian military forces and the Georgian military forces, which commenced on August 13, 2008 as part of the 2008 South Ossetian War, and ended with the withdrawal of Russian units from the city by 22 August 2008.
Background and initial airstrikes.
Gori is a Georgian city close to the border with the breakaway province of South Ossetia. It was the staging area for the Georgian army during the Battle of Tskhinvali and was bombed several times by the Russian Air Force.
On August 9, the bombs hit a residential district of the city near the local military base, destroying and damaging several apartment buildings and a school, killing and injuring many. According to the Georgian Government, 60 were killed.
Georgian abandonment.
By the evening of August 10, following a warning by the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs that Gori was "not safe", large numbers of the civilian population began to flee the city. The next day, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said about 56,000 people have fled the Gori District.
On August 11 Gori was abandoned by the Georgian army. The hasty retreat left a number of abandoned Georgian army vehicles and pieces of heavy military equipment behind. The Georgian forces fled to the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi.
The final air attacks.
Georgian officials say Russian forces had been targeting the city's administrative buildings and claimed that the university of Gori and its post office were on fire after the bombings. On August 12, a Dutch television journalist Stan Storimans was killed and several other foreigners injured when Russian warplanes bombed the central district of the city. 4 Georgian civilians were also killed. During the final strikes, an air-to-ground missile hit the Gori hospital.
Human Rights Watch (HRW), an international rights group, accused Russia of indiscriminately deploying cluster bombs in civilian areas during the 2008 conflict. HRW said that Russian aircraft had dropped RBK-250 cluster bombs, each containing 30 PTAB 2.5M submunitions or "bomblets" in the center of Gori on August 12, killing at least eight civilians and injuring dozens more.
Russian military officials denied using cluster munitions, calling the HRW assertion "slanderous". Numerous unexploded "bomblets" were subsequently found by local population and the HRW. Objectivity Data Human Rights Watch has repeatedly been questioned by Russia. Later, Georgia has officially recognized the Georgian aviation use of cluster bombs.
Russian occupation.
Around the 13 August Russian ground forces have entered Gori. On August 14, the Russian Ministry of Defence official Vyacheslav Borisov claimed that the city of Gori was controlled jointly by Georgian Police and Russian troops. He further said that Russian troops would start leaving Gori in two days. Russian troops said they were removing military hardware and ammunition from an arms depot outside Gori.
The Russian forces denied access to some humanitarian aid missions seeking to assist civilians. The United Nations, which has described the humanitarian situation in Gori as "desperate," was able to deliver only limited food supplies to the city. On August 15, Russian troops allowed a number of humanitarian supplies into the city but continued their blockade of the strategically located city. Russia's UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, denied that Russian troops were occupying Gori, saying that Russian soldiers "are not in Gori, have never been in Gori and do not occupy Gori," and rejecting news reports that the town was in ruins.
In the August 17 report, HRW said the organization's researchers interviewed ethnic Georgians from the city of Gori and surrounding villages who described how armed Ossetian pro-Russian militias attacked their cars and kidnapped civilians as people tried to flee in response to militia attacks on their homes following the Russian advance into the area. In phone interviews, people remaining in Gori region villages told HRW that they had witnessed looting and arson attacks by Ossetian militias in their villages, but were afraid to leave after learning about militia attacks on those who fled. The Russian human rights group Memorial called these attacks "pogroms".
Russian pull out of Gori.
The last Russian military formations left the city late on August 22, 2008, and Georgian law enforcement units moved into Gori shortly thereafter. Georgian authorities have reported that they were in control of the city and its outskirts. Gigi Ugulava, the mayor of Tbilisi, said that the authorities would arrange an organized return of tens of thousands of refugees to Gori. The closest Russian checkpoint remaining in the vicinity of Gori was located in the village of Karaleti, just five kilometers from the town.

Riemannian connection on a surface

In mathematics, the Riemannian connection on a surface or Riemannian 2-manifold refers to several intrinsic geometric structures discovered by Tullio Levi-Civita, Ãlie Cartan and Hermann Weyl in the early part of the twentieth century: parallel transport, covariant derivative and connection form . These concepts were put in their final form using the language of principal bundles only in the 1950s. The classical nineteenth century approach to the differential geometry of surfaces, due in large part to Carl Friedrich Gauss, has been reworked in this modern framework, which provides the natural setting for the classical theory of the moving frame as well as the Riemannian geometry of higher dimensional Riemannian manifolds. This account is intended as an introduction to the theory of connections.
Historical overview.
After the classical work of Gauss on the differential geometry of surfaces and the subsequent emergence of the concept of Riemannian manifold initiated by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-nineteenth century, the geometric notion of connection developed by Tullio Levi-Civita, Ãlie Cartan and Hermann Weyl in the early twentieth century represented a major advance in differential geometry. The introduction of parallel transport, covariant derivatives and connection forms gave a more conceptual and uniform way of understanding curvature, which not only allowed generalisations to higher dimensional manifolds but also provided an important tool for defining new geometric invariants, called characteristic classes. The approach using covariant derivatives and connections is nowadays the one adopted in more advanced textbooks.
Although Gauss was the first to study the differential geometry of surfaces in E3, it was not until Riemann's Habilitationsschrift of 1854 that the notion of a Riemannian space was introduced. Christoffel introduced his eponymous symbols in 1869. Tensor calculus was developed by Ricci, who published a systematic treatment with Levi-Civita in 1901. Covariant differentiation of tensors was given a geometric interpretation by who introduced the notion of parallel transport on surfaces. His discovery prompted Weyl and Cartan to introduce various notions of connection, including in particular that of affine connection. Cartan's approach was rephrased in the modern language of principal bundles by Ehresmann, after which the subject rapidly took its current form following contributions by Chern, Ambrose and Singer, Kobayashi, Nomizu, Lichnerowicz and others.
Connections on a surface can be defined in a variety of ways. The Riemannian connection or Levi-Civita connection is perhaps most easily understood in terms of lifting vector fields, considered as first order differential operators acting on functions on the manifold, to differential operators on the frame bundle: in the case of an embedded surface, the lift is very simply described in terms of orthogonal projection. Indeed the vector bundles associated with the frame bundle are all sub-bundles of trivial bundles that extend to the ambient Euclidean space; a first order differential operator can always be applied to a section of a trivial bundle, in particular to a section of the original sub-bundle, although the resulting section might no longer be a section of the sub-bundle. This can be corrected by projecting orthogonally.
The Riemannian connection can also be characterized abstractly independently of an embedding. The equations of geodesics are easy to write in terms of the Riemannian connection, which can be locally expressed in terms of the Christoffel symbols. Along a curve in the surface, the connection defines a first order differential equation in the frame bundle. The monodromy of this equation defines parallel transport for the connection, a notion introduced in this context by Levi-Civita. This gives an equivalent more geometric way of describing the connection in terms of lifting paths in the manifold to paths in the frame bundle. This formalised the classical theory of the "moving frame", favoured by French authors. Lifts of loops about a point give rise to the holonomy group at that point. The Gaussian curvature at a point can be recovered from parallel transport around increasingly small loops at the point. Equivalently curvature can be calculated directly infinitesimally in terms of Lie brackets of lifted vector fields.
The approach of Cartan, using connection 1-forms on the frame bundle of "M", gives a third way to understand the Riemannian connection, which is particularly easy to describe for an embedded surface. Thanks to a result of , later generalized by , the Riemannian connection on a surface embedded in Euclidean space "E"3 is just the pullback under the Gauss map of the Riemannian connection on "S"2. 
Using the identification of "S"2 with the homogeneous space SO(3)/SO(2), the connection 1-form is just a component of the Maurer-Cartan 1-form on SO(3). In other words everything reduces to understanding the 2-sphere properly.
Covariant derivative.
For a surface "M" embedded in E3 (or more generally a higher dimensional Euclidean space), there are several equivalent definitions of a vector field "X" on "M":
The last condition means that the assignment "f" "Xf" on "C"â("M") satisfies the Leibniz rule
The space of all vector fields formula_2("M") forms a module over "C"â("M"), closed under the Lie bracket
with a "C"â("M")-valued inner product ("X","Y"), which encodes the Riemannian metric on "M".
Since formula_2("M") is a submodule of "C"â("M", E3)="C"â("M")formula_5 E3, the operator "X"formula_5 "I" is defined on formula_2("M"), taking values in "C"â("M", E3).
Let "P" be the smooth map from "M" into "M"3(R) such that "P"("p") is the orthogonal projection of E3 onto the tangent space at "p".
Pointwise multiplication by "P" gives a "C"â("M")-module map of "C"â("M", E3) onto formula_2("M") . The assignment
defines an operator formula_9 on formula_2("M") called the covariant derivative, satisfying the following properties
The first three properties state that formula_15 is an affine connection compatible with the metric, sometimes also called a "hermitian" or metric connection. The last symmetry property says that the torsion tensor
vanishes identically, so that the affine connection is torsion-free.
Although the Riemannian connection was defined using an embedding in Euclidean space, this uniqueness property means that it is in fact an "intrinsic invariant" of the surface.
It existence can be proved directly for a general surface by noting that the four properties imply
so that formula_18 depends only on the metric and is unique. On the other hand if this is used as a definition of formula_18, it is readily checked that the four properties above are satisfied.
Equivalently, in local coordinates ("x","y") with basis tangent vectors e1=formula_20 and e2 =
formula_21, the connection formula_15 can be expressed purely in terms of the metric using the Christoffel symbols:
Parallel transport.
Given a curve in the Euclidean plane and a vector at the starting point, the vector can be transported along the curve by requiring the moving vector to remain parallel to the original one and of the same length, i.e. it should remain constant along the curve. If the curve is closed, the vector will be unchanged when the starting point is reached again. This is well known not to be possible on a general surface, the sphere being the most familiar case. In fact it is not usually possible to identify simultaneously or "parallelize" all the tangent planes of such a surface: the only parallelizable closed surfaces are those homeomorphic to a torus.
Parallel transport can always be defined along curves on a surface using only the metric on the surface. Thus tangent planes along a curve can be identified using the intrinsic geometry, even when the surface itself is not parallelizable.
Parallel transport along geodesics, the "straight lines" of the surface, is easy to define. A vector in the tangent plane is transported along a geodesic as the unique vector field with constant length and making a 
constant angle with the velocity vector of the geodesic.
For a general curve, its geodesic curvature measures how far the curve departs from being a geodesics; it is defined as the rate at which the curve's velocity vector rotates in the surface. In turn the geodesic curvature determines how vectors in the tangent planes along the curve should rotate during parallel transport.
A vector field "v"("t") along a unit speed curve "c"("t"), with geodesic curvature "k""g"("t"), is said to be parallel along the curve if
This yields the previous rule for parallel transport along a geodesic, because in that case "k""g" = 0, so the angle Î¸("t") should remain constant. The existence of parallel transport follows from standard existence theorems for ordinary differential equations. The above differential equation can be rewritten in terms of the covariant derivative as
This equation shows once more that parallel transport depends only on the metric structure so is an intrinsic invariant of the surface. Parallel transport can be extended immediately to piecewise C1 curves.
When "M" is a surface embedded in E3, this last condition can be written in terms of the projection-valued function "P" as
or in other words:
Arnold has suggested that since parallel transport on a geodesic segment is easy to describe, parallel transport on an arbitrary C1 curve could be constructed as a limit of parallel transport on an approximating family of piecewise geodesic curves.
This equation shows once more that parallel transport depends only on the metric structure so is an intrinsic invariant of the surface; it is another way of writing the ordinary differential equation involving the geodesic curvature of "c". Parallel transport can be extended immediately to piecewise C1 curves.
The covariant derivative can in turn be recovered from parallel transport. In fact formula_18 can be calculated at a point "p", by taking a curve "c" through "p" with tangent "X", using parallel transport to view the restriction of "Y" to "c" as a function in the tangent space at "p" and then taking the derivative.
Orthonormal frame bundle.
Let "M" be a surface embedded in E3. The orientation on the surface means that an "outward pointing" normal unit vector n is defined at each point of the surface and hence a determinant can be defined on tangent vectors v and w at that point:
using the usual scalar triple product on E3 (itself a determinant).
An ordered basis or frame v, w in the tangent space is said to be "oriented" if det(v, w) is positive.
Since the group of rotations in the plane SO(2) acts simply transitively on oriented orthonormal frames in the plane, it follows that it also acts on the frame or circle bundles of "M". The definitions of the tangent bundle, the unit tangent bundle and the (oriented orthonormal) frame bundle "E" can be extended to arbitrary surfaces in the usual way. There is a similar identification between the latter two which again become principal SO(2)-bundles. In other words:
There is also a corresponding notion of parallel transport in the setting of frame bundles:
This statement means that any frame on a curve can be parallelly transported along the curve. This is precisely the idea of "moving frames". 
Since any unit tangent vector can be completed uniquely to an oriented frame, parallel transport of tangent vectors implies (and is equivalent to) parallel transport of frames. The lift of a geodesic in "M" turns out to be a geodesic in "E" for the Sasaki metric (see below). Moreover the Gauss map of "M" into "S"2 induces a natural map between the associated frame bundles which is equivariant for the actions of SO(2).
Cartan's idea of introducing the frame bundle as a central object was the natural culmination of the theory of moving frames, developed in France by Darboux and Goursat. It also echoed parallel developments in Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Objects appearing in the formulas of Gauss, such as the Christoffel symbols, can be given a natural geometric interpretation in this framework. Unlike the more intuitive normal bundle, easily visualised as a tubular neighbourhood of an embedded surface in E3, the frame bundle is an intrinsic invariant that can be defined independently of an embedding. When there is an embedding, it can also be visualised as a subbundle of the Euclidean frame bundle E3 x SO(3), itself a submanifold of E3 x M3(R).
Principal connection.
The theory of connections according to Ãlie Cartan, and later Charles Ehresmann, revolves around:
All "natural" vector bundles associated with the manifold "M", such as the tangent bundle, the cotangent bundle or the exterior bundles, can be constructed from the frame bundle using the representation theory of the structure group "K" = SO(2), a compact matrix group. 
Cartan's definition of a connection can be understood as a way of lifting vector fields on "M" to vector fields on the frame bundle "E" invariant under the action of the structure group "K". Since parallel transport has been defined as a way of lifting piecewise C1 paths from
"M" to "E", this automatically induces infinitesimally a way to lift vector fields or tangent vectors from "M" to "E". At a point take a path with given tangent vector and then map it to the tangent vector of the lifted path. (For vector fields the curves can be taken to be the integral curves of a local flow.) In this way any vector field "X" on "M" can be lifted to a vector field "X"* on "E" satisfying
Here "K" acts as a periodic flow on "E", so the canonical generator "A" of its Lie algebra acts as the corresponding vector field, called the vertical vector field "A"*. It follows from the above conditions that, in the tangent space of an arbitrary point in "E", the lifts "X"* span a two-dimensional subspace of horizontal vectors, forming a complementary subspace to the vertical vectors. The canonical Riemannian metric on "E" of Shigeo Sasaki is defined by making the horizontal and vertical subspaces orthogonal, giving each subspace its natural inner product.
Horizontal vector fields admit the following characterisation:
This "universal lift" then immediately induces lifts to vector bundles associated with "E" and hence allows the covariant derivative, and its generalisation to forms, to be recovered.
If Ï is a representation of "K" on a finite-dimensional vector space "V", then the associated vector bundle "E" X"K" "V" over "M" has a Câ("M")-module of sections that can be identified with
the space of all smooth functions Î¾Â :Â "E"Â âÂ "V" which are "K"-equivariant in the sense that
for all "x"Â âÂ "E" and "g"Â âÂ "K".
The identity representation of SO(2) on R2 corresponds to the tangent bundle of "M".
The covariant derivative formula_9 is defined on an invariant section Î¾ by the formula
The connection on the frame bundle can also be described using "K"-invariant differential 1-forms on "E".
The frame bundle "E" is a 3-manifold. The space of "p"-forms on "E" is denoted Î"p"("E"). It admits a natural action of the structure group "K".
Given a connection on the principal bundle "E" corresponding to a lift "X" "X"* of vector fields on "M", there is a unique connection form Ï in
the space of "K"-invariant 1-forms on "E", such that
for all vector fields "X" on "M" and
for the vector field "A"* on "E" corresponding to the canonical generator "A" of formula_34.
Conversely the lift "X"* is uniquely characterised by the following properties:
Cartan structural equations.
On the frame bundle "E" of a surface "M" there are three canonical 1-forms:
If Ï: "E" formula_35 "M" is the nature projection, the 1-forms Î¸1 and Î¸2 are defined by
where "Y" is a vector field on "E" and "e""1", "e"2 are the tangent vectors to "M" of the orthonormal frame.
These 1-forms satisfy the following structural equations, due in this formulation to Cartan:
where "K" is the Gaussian curvature on "M".
Holonomy and curvature.
Parallel transport in the frame bundle can be used to show that the Gaussian curvature of a surface "M" measures the amount of rotation obtained by translating vectors around small curves in "M". Holonomy is exactly the phenomenon that occurs when a tangent vector (or orthonormal frame) is parallelly transported around a closed curve. The vector reached when the loop is closed will be a rotation of the original vector, i.e. it will correspond to an element of the rotaion group SO(2), in other words an angle modulo 2Ï. This is the "holonomy of the loop", because the angle does not depend on the choice of starting vector.
This geometric interpretation of curvature relies on a similar geometric of the Lie bracket of two vector fields on "E". Let "U"1 and "U"2 be vector fields on "E" with corresponding local flows Î±"t" and Î²"t".
In general the end point E will differ from the starting point A. As "s" formula_45 0, the end point E will trace out a curve through A. The Lie bracket ["U"1,"U"2] at "x" is precisely the tangent vector to this curve at A.
To apply this theory, introduce vector fields "U"1, "U"2 and "V" on the frame bundle "E" which are dual to the 1-forms 
Î¸1, Î¸2 and Ï at each point. Thus
Moreover "V" is invariant under "K" and "U"1, "U"2 transform according to the identity representation of "K".
The structural equations of Cartan imply the following Lie bracket relations:
The geometrical interpretation of the Lie bracket can be applied to the last of these equations. Since Ï("U""i")=0, the flows Î±"t" and Î²"t" in "E" are lifts by parallel transport of their projections in "M".
Informally the idea is as follows. The starting point A and end point E essentially differ by an element of SO(2), that is an angle of rotation. The area enclosed by the projected path in "M" is approximately formula_47. So in the limit as "s" formula_45 0, the angle of rotation divided by this area tends to the coefficient of "V", i.e. the curvature.
This reasoning is made precise in the following result.
In symbols, the holonomy angle mod 2Ï is given by
where the integral is with respect to the area form on "M". 
This result implies the relation between Gaussian curvature because as the triangle shrinks in size to a point, the ratio of this angle to the area tends to the Gaussian curvature at the point. The result can be proved by a combination of Stokes's theorem and Cartan's structural equations and can in turn be used to obtain a generalisation of Gauss's theorem on geodesics triangles to more general triangles.
One of the other standard approaches to curvature, through the covariant derivative formula_9, identifies the difference
as a field of endomorphisms of the tangent bundle, the Riemann curvature tensor.
Since formula_9 is induced by the lifted vector field "X"* on "E", the use of the vector fields "U"i and "V" and their Lie brackets is more or less equivalent to this approach. The vertical vector field "W"="A"* corresponding to the canonical generator "A" of formula_34 could also be added since it commutes with "V" and satisfies ["W","U"1] = "U"2 and ["W","U"2] = â"U"1.
Example: the 2-sphere.
The differential geometry of the 2-sphere can be approached from three different points of view:
"S"2 can be identified with the unit sphere in E3
Its tangent bundle "T", unit tangent bundle "U" and oriented orthonormal frame bundle "E" are given by
The map sending ("a","v") to ("a", "v", "a" x "v") allows "U" and "E" to be identified.
Let
be the orthogonal projection onto the normal vector at "a", so that
is the orthogonal projection onto the tangent space at "a".
The group "G" = SO(3) acts by rotation on "E"3 leaving "S"2 invariant. The stabilizer subgroup "K" of the vector (1,0,0) in "E"3 may be identified with SO(2) and hence
This action extends to an action on "T", "U" and "E" by making "G" act on each component. "G" acts transitively on "S"2 and simply transitively on "U" and "E".
The action of SO(3) on "E" commutes with the action of SO(2) on "E" that rotates frames
Thus "E" becomes a principal bundle with structure group "K". Taking the "G"-orbit of the point ((1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)), the space "E" may be identified with "G". Under this identification the actions of "G" and "K" on "E" become left and right translation. In other words:
The Lie algebra formula_60 of SO(3) consists of all skew-symmetric real 3 x 3 matrices. the adjoint action of "G" by conjugation on formula_60 reproduces the action of "G" on E3. The group SU(2) has a 3-dimensional Lie algebra consisting of complex skew-hermitian traceless 2 x 2 matrices, which is isomorphic to formula_60. The adjoint action of SU(2) factors through its centre, the matrices Â± "I". Under these identifications, SU(2) is exhibited as a double cover of SO(3), so that SO(3) = SU(2) / Â± "I". On the other hand SU(2) is diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere and under this identification the standard Riemannian metric on the 3-sphere becomes the essentially unique biinvariant Riemannian metric on SU(2). Under the quotient by Â± "I", SO(3) can be identified with the real projective space of dimension 3 and itself has an essentially unique biinvariant Riemannian metric. The geometric exponential map for this metric at "I" coincides with the usual exponential function on matrices and thus the geodesics through "I" are have the form exp "Xt" where "X" is a skew-symmetric matrix. 
In this case the Sasaki metric agrees with this biinvariant metric on SO(3).
The actions of "G" on itself, and hence on "C"â("G") by left and right translation induce infinitesimal actions of formula_60 on "C"â("G") by vector fields
The right and left invariant vector fields are related by the formula
The vector fields Î»("X") and Ï("X") commute with right and left translation and give all right and left invariant vector fields on "G". Since
"C"â("S"2) = "C"â("G"/"K") can be identified with "C"â("G")"K", the function invariant under right translation by "K", the operators Î»("X") also induces vector fields Î ("X") on "S"2.
Let "A", "B", "C" be the standard basis of formula_60 given by
Their Lie brackets ["X","Y"] = "XY" â "YX" are given by
The vector fields Î»("A"), Î»("B"), Î»("C") form a basis of the tangent space at each point of "G".
Similarly the left invariant vector fields Ï("A"), Ï("B"), Ï("C") form a basis of the tangent space at each point of "G".
Let Î±, Î², Î³ be the corresponding dual basis of left invariant 1-forms on "G". The Lie bracket relations imply the Maurer-Cartan equations
These are also the corresponding components of the Maurer-Cartan form
a left invariant matrix-valued 1-form on "G", which satisfies the relation
The inner product on formula_60 defined by
is invariant under the adjoint action. Let Ï be the orthogonal projection onto the subspace generated by "A", i.e. onto formula_34, the Lie algebra of "K". For "X" in formula_60, the lift of the vector field Î ("X") from Câ("G"/"K") to Câ("G") is given by the formula
This lift is "G"-equivariant on vector fields of the form Î ("X") and has a unique extension to more general vector fields on "G" / "K".
The left invariant 1-form Î± is the connection form Ï on "G" corresponding to this lift. The other two 1-forms in the Cartan structural equations are given by Î¸1 = Î² and Î¸2 = Î³. The structural equations themselves are just the Maurer-Cartan equations. In other words;
Since Î± is the connection form,
The existence of the basis vector fields Î»("A"), Î»("B"), Î»("C") shows that SO(3) is parallelizable. This is not true for SO(3)/SO(2) by the hairy ball theorem: "S"2 does not admit any nowhere vanishing vector fields.
Parallel transport in the frame bundle amounts to lifting a path from SO(3)/SO(2) to SO(3). It can be accomplished by directly solving a matrix-valued ordinary differential equation ("transport equation") of the form "g""t" = "A" Â· "g" where "A"("t") is skew-symmetric and "g" takes values in SO(3).
In fact it is equivalent and more convenient to lift a path from SO(3)/O(2) to SO(3). Note that O(2) is the normaliser of SO(2) in SO(3) and the quotient group O(2)/SO(2), the so-called Weyl group, is a group of order 2 which acts on SO(3)/SO(2) = "S"2 as the antipodal map. The quotient SO(3)/O(2) is the real projective plane. It can be identified with space of rank one or rank two projections "Q" in M3(R). Taking "Q" to be a rank 2 projection and setting "F" = 2"Q" â "I", a model of the surface SO(3)/O(2) is given by
matrices "F" satisfying "F"2 = "I", "F" = "F"T and Tr "F" = 1. Taking "F"0= diag (â1,1,1) as base point, every "F" can be written in the form "g" "F"0 "g"â1.
If "Q"("t") is the corresponding path of rank 2 projections, the conditions for parallel transport are
Set "A" = Â½"F""t" "F". Since "F"2 = "I" and "F" is symmetric, "A" is skew-symmetric and satisfies
"QAQ"Â =Â 0.
The unique solution "g"("t") of the ordinary differential equation
with initial condition "g"(0) = "I" guaranteed by the PicardâLindelÃ¶f theorem, must have "g"T"g" constant and therefore "I", since
Moreover
since "g"â1"Fg" has derivative 0:
Hence "Q" = "g" "Q"0 "g"â1. The condition "QAQ=0" implies "Q" "g""t" "g"â1 "Q" = 0 and hence that "Q"0 "g"â1 "g""t" "Q"0 =0.
There is another kinematic way of understanding parallel transport and geodesic curvature in terms of "rolling without slipping or twisting". Although well known to differential geometers since the early part of the twentieth century, it has also been applied to problems in engineering and robotics. Consider the 2-sphere as a rigid body in three-dimensional space rolling without slipping or twisting on a horizontal plane. The point of contact will describe a curve in the plane and on the surface. At each point of contact the different tangent planes of the sphere can be identified with the horizontal plane itself and hence with one another.
This is particularly easy to visualize for a sphere: it is exactly the way a marble can be rolled along a perfectly flat table top.
The roles of the plane and the sphere can be reversed to provide an alternative but equivalent point of view. The sphere is regarded as fixed and the plane has to roll without slipping or twisting along the given curve on the sphere.
Embedded surfaces.
When a surface "M" is embedded in E3, the Gauss map from "M" formula_45 "S"2 extends to a SO(2)-equivariant map between the orthonormal frame bundles "E " formula_35 SO(3). Indeed the triad consisting of the tangent frame and the normal vector gives an element of SO(3).
In 1956 Kobayashi proved that:
This means that the forms Ï, Î¸1 and Î¸2 on "E" are obtained by pulling back those on SO(3); and that lifting paths from "M" to "E" can be accomplished by mapping the path to the 2-sphere, lifting the path to SO(3) and then pulling back the lift to "E". Thus for embedded surfaces, the 2-sphere with the principal connection on its frame bundle provides a "universal model", the prototype for the universal bundles discussed in .
In more concrete terms this allows parallel transport to be described explicitly using the transport equation. Parallel transport along a curve "c"("t"), with "t" taking values in starting from a tangent from a tangent vector "v"0 also amounts to finding a map "v"("t") from [0,1 to R3 such that
This always has a unique solution, called the parallel transport of "v"0 along "c".
The existence of parallel transport can be deduced using the analytic method described for SO(3)/SO(2), which from a path into the rank two projections
"Q"("t") starting at "Q"0 produced a path "g"("t") in SO(3) starting at "I" such that
"g"("t") is the unique solution of the transport equation
with "g"(0) = "I" and "F" = 2"Q" â I. Applying this with "Q"("t") = "P"("c"("t")), it follows that, given a tangent vector "v"0 in the tangent space to "M" at "c"(0), 
the vector "v"("t")="g"("t")"v"0 lies in the tangent space to "M" at "c"("t") and satisfies the equation
It therefore is exactly the parallel transport of "v" along the curve "c". In this case the length of the vector "v"("t") is constant. More generally if another initial tangent vector "u"0 is taken instead of "v"0, the inner product ("v"("t"),"u"("t")) is constant. The tangent spaces along the curve "c"("t") are thus canonically identified as inner product spaces by parallel transport so that parallel transport gives an isometry between the tangent planes. The condition on the velocity vector formula_83
may be rewritten in terms of the covariant derivative as
the defining equation for parallel transport.
The kinematic way of understanding parallel transport for the sphere applies equally well to any closed surface in E3 regarded as a rigid body in three-dimensional space rolling without slipping or twisting on a horizontal plane. The point of contact will describe a curve in the plane and on the surface. As for the sphere, the usual curvature of the planar curve equals the geodesic curvature of the curve traced on the surface.
This geometric way of viewing parallel transport can also be directly expressed in the language of geometry. The envelope of the tangent planes to "M" along a curve "c" is a surface with vanishing Gaussian curvature, which by Minding's theorem, must be locally isometric to the Euclidean plane. This identification allows parallel transport to be defined, because in the Euclidean plane all tangent planes are identified with the space itself.
There is another simple way of constructing the connection form Ï using the embedding of "M" in E3.
The tangent vectors "e"1 and "e"2 of a frame on "M" define smooth functions from "E" with values in R3, so each gives a 3-vector of functions and in particular "de"1 is a 3-vector of 1-forms on "E".
The connection form is given by
taking the usual scalar product on 3-vectors.
Gauss-Codazzi equations.
When "M" is embedded in E3, two other 1-forms Ï and Ï can be defined on the frame bundle "E" using the shape operator. Indeed the Gauss map induces a "K"-equivariant map of "E" into SO(3), the frame bundle of "S"2 = SO(3)/SO(2). The form 
Ï is the pullback of one of the three right invariant Maurer-Cartan forms on SO(3). The 1-forms Ï and Ï are defined to be the pullbacks of the other two.
These 1-forms satisfy the following structure equations:
The GaussâCodazzi equations for Ï, Ï and Ï follow immediately from the Maurer-Cartan equations for the three right invariant 1-forms on SO(3).

Jonathan O'Dea

Jonathan Richard O'Dea MP (born 9 March 1966), an Australian politician, is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Davidson for the Liberal Party of Australia since 2007.
Early life.
O'Dea was born in Sydney in 1966 to Michael and Marianne O'Dea, one of nine brothers and sisters. He was educated on the North Shore of Sydney at St Aloysius College and St Ignatius' College, Riverview, and attended the University of Sydney where he gained a Bachelor of Arts (BA), a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) and a Master of Laws (LLM). He has also undertaken further studies and was awarded a Graduate Diploma of Legal Studies and a Master of Business Administration (MBA). He is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors (FAICD). While at university, O'Dea was the Vice-President of the University of Sydney Students' Representative Council between 1986 and 1987.
Admitted as a solicitor, O'Dea practiced for five years before moving into commercial and senior management roles. He joined the Liberal Party in 1994, serving in numerous capacities, and was elected as a Councillor on North Sydney Council from 1991 until 1995.
In addition to his regular work, from 1995 to 2009 he was a non-executive board director with the private health insurer HCF. From 2000 to 2004, O'Dea also served part-time as Deputy Convenor for the Australian Classification Review Board.
Political career.
In 2005 O'Dea was the general manager of the Crown Insurance Group and a director with HCF and was named as a potential candidate for the seat of Pittwater, following the resignation of the sitting member and Opposition leader, John Brogden. However, O'Dea did not stand in the subsequent by-election and Pittwater fell to Alex McTaggart, running as an independent candidate.
In a Liberal Party preselection battle before the 2007 State election, O'Dea defeated the sitting member for Davidson, Andrew Humpherson. Humpherson had cross-factional backing among many delegates, but had lost support in local branches after reportedly instructing party members to quit branches supportive of O'Dea, thereby reducing their voting power. Despite Humpherson having the support of the Party Leader, Peter Debnam, O'Dea won the vote 54 votes to 52 and Humpherson chose to not re-contest the election. In March 2007, O'Dea was elected to Parliament with a majority of 24.7 per cent. In June 2007, he was appointed a Member of the Committee on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). From 2008 in Opposition, O'Dea served as the Chair of the NSW Coalition WasteWatch Committee. In 2011 he was elected Chair of the crucial cross-party Public Accounts Committee of the NSW Parliament.
In September 2009, O'Dea was accused in a local newspaper, the Manly Daily, of failing to adequately represent his constituents, by Ku Ring Gai Councillor Tony Hall, who urged O'Dea to "get off his backside" and lobby New South Wales Planning Minister Kristina Keneally to protect the area from excessive development. O'Dea responded, defending his record: "Along with (Opposition Leader and MP for Ku-ring-gai) Barry OâFarrell I have fought long and hard against inappropriate planning and overdevelopment...in the past 12 months I have taken part in 30 formal meetings with authorities and community representatives regarding Ku-ring-gai planning matters, three involved the planning minister and community representatives".
On 18 October 2010, the Liberal Party announced that O'Dea had been endorsed as the party's candidate for Davidson ahead of the 2011 State election. O'Dea was elected with a swing of 13.8 per cent and won the seat with 86.5 per cent of the vote on a two party preferred basis. His main competitor was Labor's Mathew Gilliland.
Personal life.
O'Dea resides in the suburb of Lindfield with his wife Jacqueline and their four children.

Artur Ayvazyan

Artur Surenovych Ayvazyan (, born January 14, 1973) is an Olympic shooter for Ukraine who won a gold medal in the 50 metre rifle prone event at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Born in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Ayvazyan took up shooting in 1985 and moved to what is now Ukraine in 1990, when he competed in his first major international tournament as a junior. He won one medal as a junior, in 1993, before moving up to the senior division in 1994. He moved to Simferopol in 1997 to train with a new coach and captured his first ISSF World Cup victory the following year. As of 2012 he has participated in every edition of the Olympics since 2000 and has won six World and seven European Championship medals in individual and team events, including his junior bronze from 1993. 
Early life.
Ayvazyan was born on January 14, 1973 in Yerevan, then part of the Soviet Union and now the capital of Armenia. He took up sport shooting in 1985 and moved to Lviv in what is now Ukraine in 1990, after his parents were unable to pay the bribe to get him into the Armenian State Institute of Physical Culture. There he entered a local infantry school and participated in his first major international tournament, the European Junior Championships in Arnhem, Netherlands, where he placed 4th in the 10 metre air rifle event. He next appeared at the European Junior Championships 1993 in Brno, Czech Republic, where he won a bronze medal in the 50 metre rifle three positions competition and finished eighth in both the 10 metre air rifle and the 50 metre rifle prone categories.
International career.
Ayvazyan entered his first senior European Shooting Championship in 1994, in Strasbourg, France, placing 26th in the 10 metre air rifle division. He also participated in the World Championships for the first time, in Milan, Italy, with a best placing of 12th in the 50 metre rifle three positions competition among four events. He finished with double digits rankings over the next three years of European Championships before finding a new coach and moving to Simferopol in 1997. His results improved in 1998 and he earned his first ISSF World Cup victory and placed fourth in the World Championships in Barcelona, Spain and the World Cup Final, all in the 50 metre rifle three positions category. He continued his success in the discipline by winning a bronze medal at the 1999 European Shooting Championships in Bordeaux, France and then participated in the 2000 Summer Olympics, where he finished 5th, 8th, and 30th in the 50 metre rifle three positions, 10 metre air rifle, and 50 metre rifle prone divisions respectively. 
Ayvazyan first reached the podium at a World Cup Final in 2001, finishing third in the 50 metre rifle three positions event. It was the first and, as of 2012, only year that he received an individual European Championship crown, after winning in the same discipline at the tournament in Zagreb, Croatia. He won a silver medal at the 2003 European Championships in the 50 metre rifle prone competition in PlzeÅ, Czech Republic in the lead up to the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he placed 7th, 9th, and 22nd in the 50 metre rifle three positions, 50 metre rifle prone, and 10 metre air rifle categories respectively. In 2005 he won a bronze medal at the European Championships held in Belgrade, Serbia in the 50 metre rifle prone division.
In 2008, upon returning from a World Cup event in Munich, Germany, Ayvazyan was detained by Ukrainian customs for having an unregistered gun and was placed under suspicion of weapons smuggling. Half of the team was called in for questioning and, after going through two courts and losing significant training time during their final preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics, it was eventually determined that the guns were all legally registered and that the evidence suggesting otherwise was planted in an attempt to discredit the head coach. At the Games, Ayvazyan won the gold medal in the 50 metre rifle prone event, in addition to finishing 19th and 21st in the 50 metre rifle three positions and 10 metre air rifle competitions respectively. His Olympic victory not his only podium finish that year: he won his fifth, and as of 2012 most recent, World Cup event in the 50 metre rifle three positions discipline and placed second in the division at the World Cup Final, his highest ranking in the tournament as of 2012.

2009 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby

The 2009 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby (known through sponsorship reasons as the State Farm Home Run Derby) was the sport's 25th annual home run-hitting contest and took place on July 13, 2009, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, the host location of the MLB All-Star Game. ESPN (United States), Rogers Sportsnet (Canada), and ESPN America (Europe) telecast the event, while ESPN Radio broadcast on radio.
The winner of the event was Prince Fielder of the Milwaukee Brewers.
Rules.
Each participant is thrown pitches by a pitcher of his choice. The hitter has the option of not swinging at a pitch. If he swings at a pitch and misses or hits the pitch anywhere but in home run territory, it is considered an out. Each player hits until he receives 10 outs in each round. 
In the first two rounds, home run totals carried over for those rounds. Should there be a tie after either of the first two rounds, a "Swing-Off" takes place. In a Swing-Off, each tied player gets 5 swings to get as many home runs as possible. Home runs hit during a first round Swing-Off does not count towards the player's total going into the second round. All eight players participated in the first round; the four highest totals from round one will move to the semi-finals. The top two totals will face off in the finals, with the scores deleted from the first two rounds.
Charitable Initiatives.
Gold Ball.
When a player reaches nine outs in each round, the "Gold Ball" was brought into play. For each Gold Ball hit for a home run, State Farm agreed to donate US $17,000 (one dollar for each of their agents) for each home run hit to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. This marks the fifth Home Run Derby for the Gold Ball rule. Each non-Gold Ball homer was worth $5,000. Overall, $527,000 was raised.
Stand Up 2 Cancer.
MasterCard International would have donated $1 million to the Stand Up to Cancer initiative if a player had hit a home run off one of three designated banners in the stadium, which nobody did. Previously, sponsors like MasterCard and Chevrolet had given away 500 airline tickets and automobiles had home run balls hit designated banners. The banners remained in place for the All-Star Game.

He and Manfred Ewald, who served as German Democratic Republic's (GDR) minister of sport ('61 to '88) and president of his country's Olympic committee ('73-'90), are regarded as the architects of their country's state-sponsored system of using illicit performance-enhancing drugs, which is believed to explain GDR's Olympic success between 1972 through 1988. Hoeppner allegedly had ties to the East German secret police, the Stasi.
Doping Scandal.
On July 18, 2000, in Berlin, both Manfred Ewald and Dr. Hoeppner were convicted as accessories to intentional bodily harm of athletes, including minors. Both received probation. During the trial Dr. Hoeppner testified that they had approval from the highest level of the government of the GDR.

East Gippsland Catchment Management Authority

The East Gippsland Catchment Management Authority (CMA) covers 22,000 kmÂ² of land, lakes and coastal waters in the easternmost part of Victoria.
About 80% of the land of the region is in public ownership, mainly as State Forests and National Parks. With 40,000 residents, the current population is about 10 times that of the original Aboriginal population of the Kurnai-Gunai, Bidawal and Ngarigo peoples.
East Gippsland Region.
Variability of climate is a notable feature of the region. Rainfall ranges from 2,200 mm on the Errinundra Plateau to 500 mm in rain shadow areas like the upper Snowy valley. Annual rainfall is highly variable which gives rise to frequent droughts and major flooding events that have significant land management impacts. Some of the important features of East Gippsland are:
Mountains and forests, which provide great scenery, clean air, clean water, recreational opportunity and forestry products;
Program Highlights.
The regionâs natural resource management priorities have been dominated by two factors:
East Gippsland has encountered major droughts in 1997/98 and 2002/07 which have given cause to the largest bushfires in European history in 2002/03 and 2006/07. Each major drought has also been broken by major floods in 1998 and 2007. Major recovery works have been undertaken in response to all these natural events.
East Gippsland CMA has the largest number of high value rivers including the Mitchell, Snowy, Bemm, Cann and Genoa. Work programs have been designed to manage invasive threats such as willows and blackberries to help maintain them in good condition. The Snowy has been the subject of a major rehabilitation effort including return of environmental flows and river rehabilitation works.
River health funding has been utilised to control willows in the Bemm, Snowy, Nicholson, upper Tambo, and upper Mitchell Rivers, as well as in all catchments east of the Cann River.
The regionâs native plants and animals are part of the Jewel in the Crown of Victoriaâs biodiversity. Initiatives such as the Southern Ark program have led the State in large scale native animal conservation and pest animal control.
Future challenges.
The population in the East Gippsland CMA area is concentrated along the coast in major towns like Bairnsdale, Victoria, Lakes Entrance, Victoria, Paynesville, Victoria and Metung, Victoria near the Gippsland Lakes. This is a major economic driver which has focused the attention of the community on maintaining the Lakes in good health.
In a recent survey of the area, over 70% of those surveyed considered the Lakes their most valuable natural asset.
The Great Alpine and Divide Fires of 02/03 and 06/07 created extensive burnt areas in the Mitchell, Tambo, Nicholson and Snowy River catchments and together with recent floods will cause water quality and supply problems for many years.

Abbey of St Genevieve

The Abbey of St Genevieve (Abbaye-Sainte-GeneviÃ¨ve) was a French monastery in Paris, suppressed at the time of the French Revolution.
History.
The Abbey, close to the Ãglise Saint-Ãtienne-du-Mont and the present PanthÃ©on (its rebuilt abbey church), was said to have been founded in 502 by King Clovis I and his queen, Clotilde, in the name of the Holy Apostles, jointly dedicated to Peter and Paul. Later Saint GeneviÃ¨ve was in the habit of coming to pray, taking a route commemorated by the name rue de la Montagne-Sainte-GeneviÃ¨ve. At her death in 512, her remains were interred at the abbey church, near the tomb of Clovis. 
In 1147 secular canons officiated in the church. King Louis VII of France and Pope Eugene III, having witnessed some disorders, determined to restore discipline. At the request of Suger and Bernard of Clairvaux, Gildwin, the first Abbot of St-Victor, sent Odo, the prior of his abbey. There were difficulties, but order finally prevailed and some of the canons joined the reform, the Abbey becoming a house of Canons Regular. 
Among these was the young William of Paris. At the request of Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde in Denmark, who when a student at Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve's had known him, William was sent to that country to reform EskilsÃ¸ Abbey, a monastery of canons in the Isle of Eskil. He founded another monastery, which he dedicated to the Holy Paraclete. He died in 1206, and was canonized by Pope Honorius III. It was natural that close relations should exist between Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve and its foundations in Denmark. Peter Sunesen, a young man who made his profession at the abbey, became Bishop of Roskilde; Valdemar, brother of Cnut the Great, died at Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve; and Abbot Stephen of Tournai wrote to William and his friends to obtain lead for the roof of his abbey.
Like the Abbey of St-Victor, Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve became a celebrated seat of learning and the site of a great medieval library. St-Victor, Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve, and Notre-Dame were the cradles of the University of Paris. Peter de FerriÃ¨re, Abbot of St-Victor, was at one time prior of Epinay, a priory of Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve; William of Auxerre, a professed canon of St-Victor in 1254, held the office of cellarer, and became Abbot of Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve; and Marcel, successively canon at St-Victor and Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve, was in 1198 made Abbot of Cisoing. 
In later centuries this abbey fell into the hands of abbots "in commendam". In the early seventeenth century Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld undertook the reforms required by the Council of Trent. He brought from Senlis Charles Faure (d. 1644), who had already restored the canonical rule in the ancient Abbey of Silvanect. Once more the Rule of St. Augustine was faithfully observed at Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve's which became the mother-house of the Gallican "CongrÃ©gation de France", an associatiuon of the Augustinian abbeys called the "GÃ©novÃ©fains". 
By the middle of the seventeenth century the abbot-general of the congregation had under his jurisdiction more than one hundred abbeys and priories. Men like Fronteau, chancellor of the university and author of many works, Laleman, Chapponel, Reginier, Chengot, Beurier, du Moulinet, founder of the national library, and Augustine Hay, a Scotsman who wrote the "Scotia sacra" and officiated at Holyrood, Scotland, in 1687, were sons of the French congregation. The astronomer Alexandre Guy PingrÃ© was librarian of Sainte-GeneviÃ¨ve.
In the mid-18th century, a project of reconstruction was begun. An immense abbey church over the old crypt was built, to designs by Jacques-Germain Soufflot; in part rebuilt, it serves today as the PanthÃ©on.
Suppression.
When in 1790 the revolutionary assembly declared all religious vows void, and evicted all of the residents of the monasteries, there were thirty-nine canons at Ste-GeneviÃ¨ve's. This was the end of the abbey and school. To run the new rue Clovis through the site, the building was demolished shortly after 1800, except for the bell tower, called the "Tour Clovis". Now the LycÃ©e Henri-IV, built in part with elements of the abbey buildings, occupies the site.

Tkaronto

Tkaronto is a Canadian drama film, which premiered in 2007 at the ImagineNATIVE Film and Media Festival in Toronto. Directed by Shane Belcourt, the film went into commercial release in the summer of 2008. 
The film, named for the Mohawk word from which the city of Toronto derives its name, stars Duane Murray and Melanie McLaren as Ray Morrin and Jolene Peltier, who meet while in Toronto on business. Ray, a MÃ©tis cartoonist from Vancouver, is in town to pitch an animated series called "Indian Jones" to a television network, and Jolene, an Anishinaabe artist from Los Angeles, is in town to paint a portrait of Max (Lorne Cardinal), a local aboriginal elder.
The film's cast also includes Cheri Maracle, Jeff Geddis, Mike McPhaden, Rae Ellen Bodie, Jonah Allison, Abby Zotz and Tricia Williams.
Themes.
Ray and Jolene experience a common struggle: as creative professionals living in big cities, they share a sense of disconnection from their aboriginal heritage. Both struggle with the question of how to live as an aboriginal person in an urban setting devoid of many of the stereotypical signifiers of aboriginal identity. Neither was raised with the language, religion and customs of their ancestors; Jolene doesn't even know how to pray. Both are also in relationships with non-aboriginal partners: Ray, whose girlfriend is pregnant, is ambivalent about becoming a father, while Jolene's husband is dismissive of her search for a deeper sense of her heritage. 
As their attraction to each other grows, Ray and Jolene are forced to confront the choice of whether to throw away their current lives in order to be together.
In a 2008 interview, Belcourt told "The Globe and Mail" that the film's themes were inspired by conversations with his sister Christi and a friend of hers, Inuit rock singer Lucie Idlout, about how they balanced their own aboriginal identities with their urban lifestyles.
Production.
Produced by The Breath Films in conjunction with Braincloud Films, the film was shot in just 19 days and completed on a budget of just $20,000.
Reviews.
The film was reviewed by Jason Anderson at "Eye Weekly", who wrote "The quality of writer-director Shane Belcourt's feature debut â named after our city's original Mohawk name â is all the more remarkable when you consider that it was made in six months on a measly budget of $20,000. Based on Belcourt's experience as the son of a MÃ©tis father, the movie portrays the crises of Jolene and Ray (Duane Murray), two thirty-somethings who can't figure out a way to square up their urban lifestyles and material ambitions with what an elder (played by Lorne Cardinal) calls âblood memory.â But for all of "Tkaronto"'s heavy themes, the film has a sense of lightness that makes it one of the year's most appealing local indie features."

Bus routes in Sydney

Bus routes in Sydney, Australia are generally numbered with three digits, the first digit referring to the region in which the bus route primarily operates.
Metrobus.
In October 2008, State Transit began a trial of a "timetable-less" high frequency bus route between Leichhardt in the inner west and Kingsford in the south-eastern suburbs via the CBD. A combination of fixed-body and bendy buses in a red livery were provided for the service. On 14 October 2008, "The Sydney Morning Herald" revealed plans for several more "metrobus" routes across the inner city, numbered in the 10â100 series.
The Metrobus network include:
M10 â Leichhardt Bus Depot to Kingsford later extended to Maroubra Junction via, University of New South Wales, Anzac Pde, City, Broadway, University of Sydney, Parramatta Rd and Leichhardt.
M20 â Gore Hill to Mascot Shops later extended to Botany Shops via, North Sydney, City, Central Station and Rosebery.
M30 â Spit Junction to Sydenham Station via, Military Rd, City, Railway Square, Newtown and Enmore.
M40 â Bondi Junction Interchange to Chatswood Interchange via, Oxford St, Paddington, Taylor Square, City, Freeway and Willoughby.
M41 â Macquarie Park to Hurstville via Top Ryde, Burwood and Bexley North.
M50 â Coogee to Drummoyne via, The Spot, The Royal Womans Hospital, Randwick, University of New South Wales, Central Station, City, Victoria Rd and Rozelle.
M52 â City-Circular Quay to Parramatta via, Victoria Rd, Top Ryde and West Ryde. The M52 replaces the old L20.
M54 â Parramatta to Macquarie Park via, Epping, Macquarie University and Centre. The M54 replaced the old 548.
M60 â Hornsby Interchange to Parramatta via Castle Hill. The M60 follows and replaces the 600 between Castle Hill and Parramatta.
M61 â Railway Square to Castle Hill Interchange via, City, Lane Cove Tunnel and M2 motorway. The M61 follows the 610X between City and Castle Hill.
M90 â Burwood to Liverpool via, Strathfield and Bankstown. The M90 replaces the old 900.
M91 â Parramatta to Hurstville via Bankstown.
M92 â Parramatta to Sutherland via Bankstown.
NOTE: The M10 to M54 are operated by Sydney Buses. The M60 and M61 are operated by Hillsbus. The M90 to M92 are operated by Transdev NSW.

Northern Beaches services (100 series).
69 bus routes numbered in the 100 series provide services between the Northern Beaches region of Sydney and the central business district. A complex array of all-stops, limited-stops and express services are provided. Much of the network is modelled on Sydney's former tram network, closed in 1961 in favour of a commuter bus system. 100 series services are operated by Sydney Buses and Forest Coach Lines. A number of 100 series buses serve interchanges at Warringah Mall and Manly Ferry Wharf.
Sydney Buses depots are located at Brookvale (V runs), Mona Vale (F runs), North Sydney (N runs) and Willoughby (M runs). Forest Coaches operates from Terrey Hills. Bus-only lanes are in operation at Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation, Balgowlah and Manly Road, Balgowlah.
Route 144 has the distinction of being the first government-operated bus route in Sydney. Services commenced between Manly Wharf and Cremorne Junction on 25 December 1932, connecting with tram services at Cremorne Junction. Buses were initially hired from White Transit Company at Naremburn. The service was an instant success with over 2000 passengers carried on the first day alone. In October 1931, government legislation prevented the operation of private bus services in competition with government owned tram services. As private operators could not survive as feeders only to the trams and trains, they ceased operation. This allowed the government to lease excess stock from the private operators when services began from 1932. By the 1960s, the 144 had been extended to St Leonards, and later to Chatswood.
On 2 August 2009, State transit implemented changes on this network including direct services Between Cromer Heights/War Verterns Home, and the City, new services to Elanora Heights, an extension to Warringah Mall for Route 135, and the withdrawal of some services like routes 146, 152, 172, E72, E73, & 193 plus more changes to various routes within the region.
North Shore services (200 series).
Services connecting Sydney's Northern Suburbs and North Shore regions with the central business district are numbered in the 200 series. There are 62 routes, numbered 200 through 297. Express and limited-stops services are also provided. Much of the network is modelled on Sydney's former tram network, closed in 1961 in favour of a commuter bus system. 200 series services are operated by Sydney Buses and Forest Coach Lines.
The major bus interchanges in this region are located at Chatswood Interchange, part of Chatswood railway station, Lane Cove, and stands in Blue Street, Miller Street and the Pacific Highway in North Sydney.
In general, citybound 200 series buses terminate at the Queen Victoria Building (near Town Hall railway station) and operate via the bus/rail interchange above Wynyard station. In general, 200 series buses operate from Sydney Buses depots at Willoughby (M runs), North Sydney (N runs) and Ryde (Y runs); and the Forest Coach Lines depot at Terrey Hills. Route 200 operates from Waverley depot (W runs) near the line's southern terminus in the Eastern Suburbs. Bus-only lanes have been installed on the Warringah Freeway, Epping Road, North Sydney and Military Road, Neutral Bay as well as on a southbound lane of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Eastern Suburbs services (300 series).
Bus routes in Sydney's eastern suburbs are numbered in the 300 series. Seventy-one routes are numbered 301 through 399, all of which are operated by Sydney Buses. Express and limited-stops services are also provided numbered in the X and L series. Much of the network is modelled on Sydney's former tram network which closed in 1961 in favour of a commuter bus system. Given their high density, Sydney's eastern suburbs have a significant public transport infrastructure in place. A bus-only roadway uses the old tramway alignment to speed buses through Moore Park and Centennial Park. A bus-only tunnel at Edgecliff gives buses priority access from New South Head Road to the terminal above the railway station. Bus-only lanes are in place on Anzac Parade and Oxford Street, two of the region's main roads. Buses run to most major locations such as Bondi Beach, Bondi Jn, Botany, Coogee Beach, Eastgardens and Maroubra Jn .
State Transit maintains two major bus interchanges, located above Edgecliff railway station and Bondi Junction railway station. Another interchange is located within the Westfield Eastgardens shopping centre complex in Pagewood. Other significant nodes include Randwick Junction, Kingsford Nine Ways, Bondi Beach, Coogee Beach and the University of New South Wales. Bus depots serving the area are located at Port Botany (P runs), Randwick (R runs) and Waverley (W runs).
State Transit previously operated the "Airport Express" bus (numbered 300) in bright green and gold livery between the city and Sydney Airport. The service was withdrawn after the opening of the Airport rail link to encourage passengers to use the new rail line, given that the NSW government was obliged to pay compensation to the Airport Link Company if patronage targets were not met.
The 370 service, linking Coogee Beach and Leichhardt via Newtown, Glebe and the universities of New South Wales and Sydney.
In 2008, State Transit released a proposal to reorganise some bus routes around the Green Square area, involving routes 301, 302, 303, 311, 343, X43, 357, & 359, ., and the results were that there were to be some changes to some of those services but the biggest change is that Route 348 has now been altered to operate a Weekday Daytime service and at the same time, extended to Wolli Creek via Rosebery.
In 2013 the state government announced some major changes proposed for the bus routes around Randwick and Kingsford following the plan to build a light rail line by 2020. This included the discontinuation of some services (M10, M50, 373, 376, 395 & 396) and re-routing of some other services to Randwick, Kensington or Edgeclift for heavy rail (374, L94). The only Anzac Parade services to the city will run to Central from Coogee and Clovelly (339, 372). All non-city services will remain as well as peak-hour express services. 
Bondi Beach services.
Route 333 is State Transits first 'Prepay Only' limited stops service which parallels the 380. It was introduced in 2006 and is operated by articulated buses based in Waverley bus depot.
Passengers are required to purchase tickets before boarding the bus in order to reduce loading times and speed up the service. Buses serving route 333 are outfitted with special removable "prepay only" signage. The 333 replaced many of the timetable's 380 services. Passengers paying cash extend loading times significantly, and 380 passengers, many of them tourists, are twice as likely to use cash. Former Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales chief Ken Dobinson told the "Sydney Morning Herald" that the cashless bus route was a "half measure" and suggested that cashless routes would be used to improve bus performance while the city waited for the overdue Tcard system to be implemented.
Route 360 replaced the former Route 329. The 360 runs between North Clovelly and Bondi Junction 
Interchange
Route 362 operates from Bondi Beach to Coogee through Tamarama and Clovelly during the Summer Months as a Beach Runner Service.
Route 380 operates from North Bondi to Circular Quay through some of Sydney's most densely populated neighbourhoods. It replaced the famous "Bondi Tram" which closed in 1960. Additional services operate to and from Dover Heights and Watsons Bay. In 2002, a diversion along Denham and Dudley Streets in Bondi was eliminated under the "Better Buses" programme. The 380 now operates directly along Bondi Road.
Route 381 is a supplement to the 380, consisting of short workings of the 380 between Bondi and Bondi Junction. It was introduced in 2001, and maintains a diversion along Denham and Dudley Streets in Bondi, which was removed from the 380 in 2002.
Route 382 is a variant of the 381, consisting of Friday night workings between Bondi Beach and Bondi Junction along Bondi Road, in lieu of the Denham and Dudley Streets diversion, This service also provides extra services during the Spring and Summer times especially during special events at Bondi Beach.
Route X84 is an express bus route operating between North Bondi and Bondi Junction, travelling along Curlewis Street and Old South Head Road in lieu of Bondi Road. Several trips operate towards Bondi Junction on weekday mornings only. This route was previously numbered 384 from its inception in 1979 until 1990 when it was renumbered X84. On September 2008 this service became Pre-Pay only so no tickets are sold on this service.
Route X89 is an express bus route operating between North Bondi and Bondi Junction, this is an express version of the route 389 and diverts via Edgecliff Rd, Grosvenor St and terminates at Grafton St. Several trips operate towards Bondi Junction on weekday mornings only. On September 2008 this service became Pre-Pay only so no tickets are sold on this service.
Inner West and Inner South West services (400 series).
Services in the Inner West district and part of the St George area of Sydney are numbered in the 400 series, and connect these suburbs and the central business district. There are 70 routes are numbered 400 through 499. Express and limited-stops services are also provided.

CinÃ¡ed Ciarrge mac Cathussaig (died 776) was a Dal nAraide king in Ulaid (Ulster). He was the son of Cathussach mac Ailello (died 749), a previous king and possible King of all Ulaid. He belonged to the Eilne branch of the family (in north County Antrim). He ruled from 774 to 776.
The Dal nAraide became involved in civil war during his reign and in 776 they fought a battle amongst themselves at the Battle of Sliab Mis (in the barony of Lower Antrim). That same year they engaged in another battle -the Battle of Drong. This time the opposing sides sought the assistance of their neighbors. CinÃ¡ed and his ally, DÃºngal king of the UÃ­ Tuirtri (an Airgialla tribe west of Lough Neagh), were slain by Tommaltach mac Indrechtaig (died 790) and his ally Eochaid mac Fiachnai (died 810) of the Dal Fiatach.

<doc id="18874133" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18874133" title="Polysubstance dependence">
Polysubstance dependence

A person with polysubstance dependence is psychologically addicted to being in an intoxicated state without a preference for one particular substance. Although any combination of three drugs can be used, studies have shown that alcohol is commonly used with another substance. This is supported by one study on polysubstance use that separated participants who used multiple substances into groups based on their preferred drug. The three substances were cocaine, alcohol, and heroin, which implies that those three are very popular. Other studies have found that opiates, cannabis, amphetamines, hallucinogens, inhalants and benzodiazepines are often used in combination as well. The results of a long-term or longitudinal study on substance use led the researchers to observe that excessively using or relying on one drug increased the probability of excessively using or relying on another drug. 
Epidemiology.
There are not very many studies that have examined how often polysubstance dependence occurs or how many people are dependent on multiple substances. However, according to a study that analyzed the results from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, approximately 215.5 out of a total of 43,093 individuals in the United States (0.5%) met the requirements for polysubstance abuse/dependence. Another study suggested that the number of new cases of polysubstance dependence has been going up. This idea was supported by a study that took place in Munich, Germany. A group of researchers chose to look at responses to a survey using the M-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI). The M-CIDI is a version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The researchers collected data from 3,021 participants, all between the ages of 14 and 24, to estimate the prevalence, or total number of cases, of drug abuse/dependence and of polysubstance abuse/dependence. The results of this study indicated that of the 17.3% who said that they regularly used drugs, 40% said that they used more than one substance, but 3.9% specifically reported using three or more substances, indicating that there is a lot of overlap in the use of different substances. The researchers compared their results to earlier German studies and found that substance dependence seems to be increasing, at least in Germany.
Diagnosis.
According to the DSM-IV, a diagnosis of polysubstance dependence must include a person who has used at least three different substances (not including caffeine or nicotine) indiscriminately, but does not have a preference to any specific one. In addition they must show a minimum of three of the following symptoms listed below, all within the past twelve months. There is a distinct difference between a person having three separate dependence issues and having Polysubstance dependence the main difference is polysubstance dependence means that they are not specifically addicted to one particular substance. This is often confused with multiple specific dependences present at the same time. To elaborate, if a person is addicted to three separate substance such as cocaine, methamphetamines and alcohol and is dependent on all three then they would be diagnosed with three separate dependence disorders existing together (cocaine dependence, methamphetamine dependence and alcohol dependence,) not polysubstance dependence. In addition to using three different substances without a preference to one, there has to be a certain level of dysfunction in a personâs life to qualify for a diagnosis of polysubstance dependence. One of the bigger challenges that often occurs when trying to diagnose is the fact that people don't always report what they are taking because they are afraid of getting into legal trouble. When coding polysubstance Dependence in a DSM-IV it would be a multiaxial diagnosis 304.80- Polysubstance Dependence", next to the classification, it is accompanied by a list of other types of Substance dependence (e.g. "305.00 Alcohol Abuse" or "305.60 Cocaine Abuse").
The DSM-IV requires at least three of the following symptoms present during a 12 month period for a diagnoses of polysubstance dependence.
Causes.
Biological.
There is data to support that some genes contribute to substance dependence. Some studies have focused on finding genes that predispose the person to be dependent on marijuana, cocaine, or heroin by studying genes that control a person's dopamine and opioid receptors, but no conclusive findings were reported. Other researchers found a connection between dopamine receptor genes and dependency on a substance. A potential problem with this study was that alcohol is commonly used with another substance, so the results of the study may not have been caused by dependency on a single substance. This means that multiple substances may have been contributing to the results, but the researchers suggested that further research should be done.
However, there are studies that have found evidence of the influence of genes on vulnerability to substance dependence. These studies often use genotype, or the genetic information found on a person's chromosomes, and phenotype, which consists of the visible features of a person, to look at genetic patterns. One study examined the phenotype and genotype of 1,858 participants from 893 families to look at differences in three nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes found within these individuals. The experimenters found significant connections between receptor genes for nicotine and polysubstance dependence, which indicated that differences in these genes can create the risk of being dependent on multiple substances.
Psychological.
A 1989 study conducted by Khantzian and Treece found that nearly 60% of their opioid-dependent sample met criteria for an Axis II diagnosis. In the same study, 93% of the sample had a comorbid disorder, implying that the comorbid disorder plays some role in the addiction. It has also been shown that depression and polysubstance dependence are often both present at the same time. If a person is genetically predisposed to be depressed then they are at a higher risk of having polysubstance dependence.
Possibly the most widely accepted cause of addictions is the self-medication hypothesis, that views drug addiction as a form of coping with stress throughnegative reinforcement, by temporarily alleviating awareness of or concerns over the stressor. Substance users learn that the effects of each type of drug work to relieve or better painful states. They use drugs as a form of self-medication to deal with difficulties of self-esteem, relationships, and self-care. Individuals with substance use disorders often are overwhelmed with emotions and painful situations and turn to substances as a coping method.
Sociocultural.
The socicultural causes are areas in a personâs life that might have influenced their decision to start and continue using multiple substances. Socicultural causes can be divided into social causes and cultural causes. 
Associated cognitive impairments.
Cognition refers to what happens in the mind, such as mental functions like "perception, attention, memory, language, problem solving, reasoning, and decision making." Although many studies have looked at cognitive impairments of individuals who are dependent on one drug, there are few researchers who have tried to determine the problems with cognitive functioning that are caused by dependence on multiple substances. Therefore, what is known about the effects of polysubstance dependence on mental abilities is based on the results of a few studies.
Learning ability.
The effect of polysubstance dependence on learning ability is one area of interest to researchers. A study involving 63 polysubstance dependent women and 46 controls (participants who were not using drugs) used the Benton Visual Retention Test(BVRT) and the California Verbal Learning Test(CVLT) to look at visual memory and verbal ability. This study showed that in polysubstance dependent women, verbal learning ability was significantly decreased, though visual memory was not affected. In addition, alcohol and cocaine use led to more severe issues with verbal learning, recall, and recognition.
Memory, reasoning and decision making.
Sometimes studies about specific groups in the general population can be informative. One study decided to test the cognitive abilities of participants in rave parties who used multiple substances. To do this, they compared 25 rave party attenders with 27 control participants who were not using drugs. The results of this study indicated that in general, the rave attender group did not perform as well on tasks that tested speed of information processing, working memory, knowledge of similarities between words, ability to attend to a task with interference in the background, and decision making. Certain drugs were associated with particular mental functions, but the researchers suggested that the impairments for working memory and reasoning were caused by the misuse of multiple substances.
Another study that tried to find differences between the effects of particular drugs focused on polysubstance users who were seeking treatment for addictions to cannabis, cocaine, and heroin. They studied a group of polysubstance users and a group that was not dependent on any drugs. Because alcohol was a common co-substance for nearly all of the polysubstance user group, it was difficult to tell exactly which drugs were affecting certain cognitive functions. The researchers found that the difference in the two groups' performance levels on executive function, or higher-level cognitive processing tasks were consistently showing that the polysubstance group scored lower than the control group. In general, this meant that multiple substances negatively affected the polysubstance group's cognitive functioning. More specifically, the researchers found that the amount of cannabis and cocaine affected the verbal part of working memory, the reasoning task, and decision making, while cocaine and heroin had a similar negative effect on visual and spatial tasks, but cannabis particularly affected visual and spatial working memory. These results suggest that the combined use of cannabis, cocaine, and heroin impair more cognitive functions more severely than if used separately.
Alcohol's negative effects on learning, spatial abilities and memory has been shown in many studies. This raises a question: does using alcohol in combination with other substances impair cognitive functioning even more? One study decided to try to determine if polysubstance users who also abused alcohol would display poorer performance on a verbal learning and memory test in comparison to those who abused alcohol specifically. The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) was used due to its ability to "quantify small changes in verbal learning and memory" by evaluating errors made during the test and the strategies used to make those errors. The results of this study showed that the group of polysubstance and alcohol abusers did perform poorly on the CVLT recall and recognition tests in comparison to the group of alcohol abusers only, which implies that alcohol and drug abuse combined impaired the memory and learning of the group of polysubstance and alcohol abusers in a different way than the effects of alcohol alone can explain.
Does length of abstinence matter?
Does abstinence for long periods of time help polysubstance dependent individuals to recover cognitive functioning? To examine this question, a group of researchers tested 207 polysubstance dependent men, of whom 73.4% were dependent on three or more drugs. The researchers were interested in 6 areas of cognitive functioning, which included visual memory, verbal memory, knowledge of words, abstract reasoning, inhibition (interference), and attention. The study used the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) for testing visual memory, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) for verbal memory, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale vocabulary portion for knowledge of words, the Booklet Category Test for abstract reasoning, the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening task for inhibition, and the Trail Making Test for attention. The results showed that neuropsychological ability did not improve with increases in the length of time abstinent. This suggests that polysubstance dependence leads to serious impairment which cannot be recovered much over the span of a year.
Gender differences.
Women and men differ in various ways when it comes to addictions. Research has shown that women are more likely to be polysubstant dependent. It has been noted that a larger percentage of women abuse licit (legal) drugs such as tranquilizers, sedatives, and stimulants. On the other hand, men are more likely to abuse illicit (illegal) drugs such as cocaine, meth, and other street drugs. It is also interesting to note, as research suggests, that women addicts more frequently have a family history of drug abuse. When asked to describe their onset of addictions, women more frequently describe their addiction as sudden where as men describe them as gradual.
Females have a higher percentage of fatty tissues and a lower percentage of body water than men. Therefore, women have slower absorption rates of drug substances. This means these substances are at a higher concentration in a womenâs bloodstream. Women addicts are known to be at greater risk for fatty liver disease, hypertension, anemia, and other disorders.
Comorbidity of mental disorders.
For most of these disorders, in relation to polysubstance dependence, there is a vicious cycle that those with a dependence go through. First, Ingesting the drug creates a need for more,which creates a dopamine surge, which then creates pleasure. As the dopamine subsides, the pleasure adds to the emotional and physical pain and triggers stress transmitters, which in turn creates a craving, which must then be medicated, and thus the cycle begins again. However, the next time they use more of the drug will need to be used to get to the same degree of intoxication .
Depression.
Scientists have hypothesized that the use of a drug either causes a mood disorder such as depression or at least attributes to a pre-existing one. Additionally, the substances that sufferers of depression use can be a misguided method of self-medication in order to manage their depression. This is the classic chicken or egg hypothesis, does the pre-existing condition cause dependence or does dependence cause the condition? The underlying mental illness needs to be identified and treated in conjunction with treating the polysubstance dependence in order to increase the success rate of treatment and decrease the probability of relapse. One specific study focused on alcohol and depression, because they are so commonly inter-related. Researchers have discovered that depression continues for several weeks after a patient had been rehabilitated and those who relapsed developed depression again. This means that the onset of depression happens after alcohol dependence occurs, which means that alcohol is a major contributor to depression.
Eating disorders.
One study showed that patients who are recovering from an addiction, who have had an eating disorder in the past, often use food to try to replace the substance that they are no longer getting. Or they obsess over controlling their weight and appearance. Some rehabilitation centers have licensed nutritionists to help patients develop healthy eating habits to help them cope while recovering from their addictions. It is important that those who have a former eating disorder be taught how to eat healthfully, so they donât continuously switch from one addiction back to another.
Treatment.
Treatment for polysubstance dependence has many critical aspects. Drug rehabilitation is a lengthy and difficult process. Treatment must be individualized and last a sufficient amount of time to ensure the patient has kicked the addictions and to ensure the prevention of relapse. The most common forms of treatment for polysubstance dependence include: in and outpatient treatment centers, counseling and behavioral treatments, and medications.It is important that treatments be carried on throughout the patientâs life in order to prevent relapse. It is a good idea that recovering addicts continue to attend social support groups or meet with counselors to ensure they do not relapse.
Inpatient treatment center.
Inpatient treatment centers are treatment centers where addicts move to the facility while they are undergoing treatment. Inpatient treatment centers offer a safe environment where patients will not be exposed to potentially harmful situations during their treatments as they would on the outside. Inpatient treatment centers see much higher success rates than the alternative outpatient treatments. Inpatients usually undergo the process of detoxification. Detox involves the removal (usually medically) of all drug substances from the body. Once detox is complete, the withdrawal symptoms kick in (2â3 days later). These symptoms include, but are not limited to: nausea, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, restlessness, and drug cravings. During their stay in the treatment facility, patients are learning to manage and identify their drug addictions and to find alternate ways to cope with whatever is the cause of their addiction.
Outpatient treatments.
Outpatient treatments include many of the same activities offered in an inpatient treatment facility, but the patient is not protected by the secure and safe environment of an inpatient treatment center. For this reason, they are significantly less effective. The patient usually continues to hold a job and goes to treatment nightly.
Twelve-step programs.
Both in-patient and out-patient treatments can offer introductions to 12-step programs. Suggested 12-step programs are Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA). They offer regular meetings where members can discuss their experiences in a non-judgmental and supportive place. In one study, conducted on 12-step outpatients, 1 in 5 reported abstinence from drug abuse 1 year post treatment. Twelve Step programs and other social support groups are a good way to prevent relapse.
Cognitive behavioral therapy.
Also offered to patients are one-on-one counseling sessions and cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT). When looked at through a cognitive-behavioral perspective, addictions are the result of learned behaviors developed through positive experiences. In other words, when an individual uses a drug and receives desired results (happiness, reduced stress, etc.) it may become the preferred way of attaining those results, leading to addictions. The goal of CBT is to identify the needs that the addictions are being used to meet and to develop skills and alternative ways of meeting those needs. The therapist will work with the patient to educate them on their addictions and give them the skills they need to change their cognition's and behaviors.Addicts will learn to identify and correct problematic behavior. They will be taught how to identify harmful thoughts and drug cravings. CBT is an effective treatment for addictions.
Medications.
Medications can be very helpful in the long term treatment of polysubstance dependence. Medications are a useful aid in helping to prevent or reducing drug cravings. Another benefit of Medications is helping to preventing relapse. Since drug addictions effect brain functioning, medications assist in returning to normal brain functioning. Polysubstance abusers require medications for each substance they are addicted to, as the current medications do not treat all addictions simultaneously. Medications are a useful aid in treatments, but are not effective when they are the sole treatment method.

1991 Australian Touring Car season

The 1991 Australian Touring Car season was the 32nd year of touring car racing in Australia since the first runnings of the Australian Touring Car Championship and the fore-runner of the present day Bathurst 1000, the Armstrong 500.
There were 12 touring car race meetings held during 1991; a nine round series, the 1991 Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC); a support programme event at the 1991 Australian Grand Prix and two long distance races, nicknamed 'enduros' which made up the 1991 Australian Endurance Championship.
Season review.
1991 was the low point for Group A touring car racing in Australia as grid numbers plunged in a harsh economic climate. Just eleven cars entered the Wanneroo round of the ATCC and just fifteen started the once prestigious Sandown 500.
On track the Touring Car Championship was dominated by the Gibson Motor Sport prepared Nissan Skyline GT-Rs of Jim Richards and Mark Skaife. Tony Longhursts new 2.5 litre evolution spec BMW M3 was the only car to interrupt the clean sweep. A final round DNF for Richards was not enough to take the title away, despite Skaife scoring more points over the course of the season. With only the best eight results counting Richards won the championship by five points. Gibson Motor Sport did not appear at the Sandown 500, but Nissan still won through the Bob Forbes owned car (built by Gibson) driven by Mark Gibbs and Formula Holden ace Rohan Onslow. Richards and Skaife then swept all before them at the 1991 Tooheys 1000, establishing a race record that stood until 2010. Third placing at Bathurst gave the Australian Endurance Championship to Gibbs and Onslow.
1991 also saw Peter Brock return to driving a Holden Commodore after a single season driving a BMW M3 (1988) and a Ford Sierra RS500 in 1989 and 1990. Brock's Mobil 1 Racing joined forces with Perkins Engineering run by his former Bathurst 1000 co-winner Larry Perkins to run a pair of the new Group A VN Commodore's.

Micachu

Mica Levi, known by her stage name Micachu (born 1987) is an English singer, songwriter, composer, and producer. She is classically trained and is best known for her band Micachu & The Shapes and for experimental music in a variety of genres.
Biography.
Levi was born and raised in Surrey, United Kingdom. The daughter of two musicians, she started writing and playing music at the age of four. She studied violin, viola and composition at the Purcell School before being offered a scholarship to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama to study composition.
Music.
Levi performed as a DJ in London, and released a mixtape titled "Filthy Friends", which was posted on her official Myspace page. For "Filthy Friends" she enlisted the help of friends and musicians of various backgrounds including MCs Baker Trouble, Brother May, Man Like Me & Ghostpoet, singer-songwriter Jack PeÃ±ate, jazz band Troyka, London pop-band Golden Silvers as well as producers Kwes and Toddla T. Following its release, "Filthy Friends" became sought after on the London club scene.
While a student at Guildhall, Levi was commissioned to write an orchestral piece for the London Philharmonic Orchestra which was performed at the Royal Festival Hall in April 2008.
Levi was an Artist-in-Residence at the Southbank Centre in London in 2010.
Levi co-wrote and produced Tirzah's "I'm Not Dancing" EP, which was released by Greco-Roman Records in August 2013, to critical acclaim.
Levi composed the soundtrack to "Under the Skin", a film directed by Jonathan Glazer and starring Scarlett Johansson, scheduled for release in March 2014. The film is based upon the eponymous novel by Michel Faber.
Micachu and the Shapes.
Levi formed a band called The Shapes, which includes Raisa Khan on keyboards and Marc Pell on drums. They signed to Accidental Records. With the Shapes, Levi's focus has been on experimental pop music. Most of this music prominently features an acoustic half-guitar with various non-standard tunings, extensive distortion, and use of noise and found-object elements, as well as occasionally unusual time signatures. Despite these experimental leanings, the artist categorizes her output with The Shapes as pop music.
Their debut album, "Jewellery", produced with influential electronic musician Matthew Herbert, was recorded around Mica's composition studies at Guildhall School. Advance copies of the record reached the press in early 2009, and generated positive feedback. In the wake of this growing buzz, Micachu and the Shapes were signed to Rough Trade, who released "Jewellery" on 9 March 2009. Drowned In Sound consequently hailed the record as "thrillingly improbable pop made by a grade-A maverick."
In 2009, the band received a grant from the PRS for Music Foundation.
Micachu and the Shapes toured widely throughout the UK in 2008, including performances at Bestival and V Festival. The band played in the US at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City and SXSW in Austin, Texas. They also performed on the Main Stage of the Siren Music Festival at Coney Island in Brooklyn in July 2009. Touring continued throughout Europe and North America in the summer and fall of 2009. In Spring of 2010, Micachu and the Shapes supported Spoon on tour throughout North America.
The band performed with the London Sinfonietta at Kings Place, London in May 2010 and in March 2011 released the live recording as the album "Chopped and Screwed". Unlike their previous effort, the recording largely avoids pop sensibilities in favor of a slower, hip-hop indebted style and repetitive, discordant string arrangements. The band were chosen by Animal Collective to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that they curated in May 2011 in Minehead, England.
In April 2012 the band announced that the follow-up to their debut, "Never", would be released on the 23rd of July 2012.
Self-built instruments.
Levi describes the music she performs with The Shapes as "pop", without many of pop's defining characteristics (obvious choruses and accessible lyrics). She often uses unorthodox instruments, many of which are homemade.

List of Deutsche Bundesbahn locomotives and railbuses

This article lists the locomotives and railbuses of the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), the German Federal Railways, that were in service between 1949 and 1993. For vehicles of the Deutsche Bahn AG see the List of DBAG locomotives and railbuses.
Steam locomotive classes are arranged in accordance with the DRG classification system; electric and diesel locomotives, railbuses and works vehicles are listed in accordance with the DB classification scheme. Classes that were fully retired before 1968 are listed under the classification allocated to them by the DB up to 1967. In the case of petrol-driven railbuses, a new classification system was introduced in the late 1940s that was only valid in the western zones of occupation and therefore with the later DB.
Steam Locomotives.
The table gives the vehicle class in the first column that was used by the Deutsche Bundesbahn who adopted the DRG classification system; if necessary, figures based on the running numbers are also given where this is needed to identify the sub-classes.
In the second column the class numbers are from the DB classification scheme used from 1968 onwards. Where there is no entry in this column, all the engines had been retired by the beginning of 1968.
The Deutsche Bundesbahn retired its last steam locomotives by 1977 and completely ceased all steam traction operations by 1985. 
Electric Locomotives.
The electric vehicles of the Deutsche Bundesbahn were designed for operating with a voltage of 15Â kV, 16,667Â Hz.

The Skitzos

The Skitzos were a Canadian punk rock band from Calgary, but according to The Skitzos they play "rock and roll". They performed around Western Canada from 2005 until 2008 and are regarded as Calgary's "thrashiest and trashiest", and best contemporary punk rock band. The band consisted of Aaron Arseneau (bass), Josh Boley (drums), Mark McLennan (guitar) and Ryder Thalheimer (vocals).
History.
The Skitzos formed in north east Calgary in 2004. Original guitarist Geoff Reynard quit just after releasing their independent demo 'Modern Youth' right before any local success was achieved. Mark McLennan then took over guitar and the band started making strides. Just months after the new addition The Skitzos began preparing to release what would become the Faster Louder Better! EP.
The Skitzos then began a rigorous live schedule, playing almost weekly around Alberta. The Skitzos were regarded as one of the best local live acts at the time, noted for their energetic and highly volatile performances. As well, The Skitzos were subject to much talk revolving around their offstage antics. This is best represented by their notorious run in with the police in the summer of 2006 while finishing the recording for their Longshot Music release. It has been rumoured that one of the members was knocked unconscious in a Junior High school field in northeast Calgary by a policeman while running from the police for an unknown offense.
Upon releasing their highly anticipated and well received debut EP Faster Louder Better! which kick started a vinyl resurrection in Calgary as well as a number of similar bands. The Skitzos then went on a brief tour of Alberta, most notable was their notorious weekend in Banff. After being kicked out of Banff nightclub Aurora for nudity and disorderly conduct The Skitzos then got into a fight with a taxi driver who proceeded to notify the police. The Skitzos then had to bribe the hotel concierge, by purchasing marijuana from him, to tell the police that they had not entered the building. Front desk Fred reportedly had to stop the police from entering the hotel numerous times throughout the night after being called due to illegal drugs being used through a window looking out onto Banff Ave as well as noise complaints. It is not known what exactly took place in the hotel room that night. 
The Skitzos headed back into the studio to record two new tracks. These tracks quickly became crowd favorites but were never released officially even though they received much praise from the local Albertan punk rock scene. They then only played a few shows before suddenly breaking up rather ambiguously. A small statement was released on their myspace blog.
Recently there have been rumors that the band would make a comeback.
Discography.
B-sides.
There are two unreleased tracks recorded during the Faster Louder Better! sessions. The first is a cover of the Exploding Hearts classic 'I'm A Pretender', the other called 'The Terror Song' is a more hardcore influenced song, featuring the bands trademark energy and features an intense breakdown. Both of these songs were performed live numerous times but were never officially released.
Two new tracks appeared on The Skitzos myspace in October 2007 entitled 'Let Loose' and 'Catch Me'. Both were recorded in one day, live to tape, at Calgary's Ear Candy studios. These tracks have a more Rock and Roll sound to them and have yet to be released officially, though are critic, band and fan favorites.

QÄ±mÄ±l (also, Gimilâ, QÄ±mÄ±lqazma, QÄ±mÄ±l-qazma, and Kymyl) is a village and municipality in the Quba Rayon of Azerbaijan. The Quba (Guba) District ("khanate") has a regional population of 140,000. Quba, often referred to as Guba-Khachmaz, is located in the northeast of Azerbaijan, to the north of Baku. The Azeri people welcome many tourists drawn to this ancient town, known for both its ancient historical monuments and natural beauty. 
Qimil is a mountain village set in a recreational area that runs parallel to the Gacres area, which is the most popular recreational area in the "khanate". The Qimil municipality comprises the villages of QÄ±mÄ±l, Gazma, and KÃ¼snÉtqazma. Approximately 3,879 people reside within 7 kilometers of Qimil.
Qimil history.
Since the first half of the 18th century, Quba has served as the regional administrative center for Qimil and surrounding villages. At that time, Khan Gusein Ali made Quba the capital of his widespread "khanate" and relocated his residence there. Later, Fatali Khan, his successor and most renowned ruler of Quba "khanate", united disparate Azerbaijani areas under his reign, conquering all of northwest Azerbaijan from Derbent to Lankaran. 
In 1813, Qimil, along with the rest of the Quba "khanate", was incorporated into the Russian Empire.
Qimil and the arts.
Qimil is considered one of the centers of carpet-making in the Quba district. Quba visitors will discover a carpet weaving zone featuring, among other things, "Gimil" carpets made in Qimil village like those that can be found in many museums and private collections around the world. The "kolkhoz" system of collective farming, introduced during the Soviet period, led to a decline in this beautiful craft. However, Qimil residents continued to weave carpets, primarily for dowries. In recent years, higher prices and a renewed interest in hand-made carpets has helped to revive the ancient craft in the mountain villages.
In 1996, Kurdish folk singer, poet, and activist Sivan Perwer recorded a selection named Qimil on his record album of that year entitled "NazÃª by Sivan Perwer, a collection of Kurdish Folk songs".

The cityâs suburb of QÄ±rmÄ±zÄ± QÉsÉbÉ (formerly in , ) is the home of Azerbaijan's largest community of Mountain Jews and considered as one of the largest communities of Jews in the former Soviet Union.
History.
Guba (Quba) city originated from the riverside village of Gudial. In the mid-18th century, after moving his residence from Khudat, Hussain Ali became Qubaâs Khan and raised fortress walls around the city. He thereafter attempted to create a state separate from other Azerbaijani khanates. Nevertheless, Quba khanate, the same as other khanates, was occupied by Russia in the early 19th century and annexed by the Russian Empire under the agreement of 1913.
Guba mass grave.
In May 1918, an event similar to the March Days occurred in the Guba, where Dashnak detachment, under the command of Hamazasp Srvantsyan, arrived from Baku following Armenian Bolshevist communist politician Stepan Shahumyan's order. According to the investigative commission formed by the Government of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, Hamazasp's unit burned and destroyed the city of Quba and killed at least 122 people. 
In 2007, during the construction of a stadium, builders discovered a mass grave. Azerbaijani studies claim that the human remains found there were local residents of various nationalities, including Jews and Lezgins, who had been massacred in 1918. To date, 600 human remains have been found, including about 50 children and 100 women.
Monuments of architecture.
Juma Mosque.
Juma Mosque was built in the 19th century. This mosque was constructed in typical Quba province style mosques. Inside of the mosque there is a big hall crowned with a huge 16 m diameter dome.
Sakina-Khanum Mosque.
Sakina-Khanum Mosque was built in 1854 by the widow of Abbasgulu Bakikhanov. The mosque was built from red bricks and is similar to faceted cylinder. Each facet has a window in the form of a semicircular arch. The top of the facade is surrounded by an original eaves made from small bricks. From top this stately building is crowned with a big white metal dome in the shape of a multi-faceted helmet. The top of the dome is decorated by a graceful thin spike.

Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority

The Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority (CMA) lies south of the Great Dividing Range, the region contains areas of scenic beauty, magnificent and dramatic coastline, superb national parks and rich biodiversity.
Glenelg Hopkins region.
The region spans some 2.6 million hectares and extends from Ballarat in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia, west to the South Australian border and south to the coast. The southern two thirds are characterised by flat volcanic plains while the Grampians, Dundas Tablelands and Black Ranges dominate the northern third.
The region has three major river drainage basins - the Hopkins, Glenelg and Portland Coast. The lower section of the Glenelg River is heritage listed for its environmental significance. Salt-wedge estuaries at the mouth of rivers entering the sea are environmentally significant. Extensive wetlands are a feature of the region and provide significant habitat for native biodiversity.
The Glenelg Hopkins region has a range of natural assets in the form of biodiversity, waterways and wetlands, soils, forests and coastal areas. These natural resources support a unique quality of life.
The south west region is an important part of provincial Victoria and boasts a diverse range of lifestyle, investment and working opportunities. The main economic drivers are agriculture, fisheries, retail, manufacturing, health and community services, education and construction. Blue gum plantations and mineral sands mining are recent additions to the regionâs industries.
Program Highlights.
Community engagement plays a vital role in the success of all natural resource programs at Glenelg Hopkins CMA.
Achieving meaningful long-term change in the health of the catchment and the way it is managed requires a holistic approach and investment in people and communities, as much as into on ground technical responses.
An engaged catchment community that understands, supports, actively participates and has a strong sense of having control of programs that shape their landscape is the most powerful tool for achieving change.
Future Challenges.
The key challenge for Glenelg Hopkins CMA is to continue to make natural resource management scientifically rigorous and socially relevant in the face of funding variations, lifestyle and populations changes, climate variability and increased demand for water resources.
The Habitat 141 project is an exciting mix of private and government initiatives that presents a unique opportunity to secure the future of the regionâs greatest natural asset â the heritage listed Glenelg River. Locking in environmental water from the Wimmera Mallee pipeline savings for the Glenelg will be an important challenge.
Combining community biodiversity improvements with productivity gains on farms and balancing public use and development with environmental protection of coasts and estuaries are the other major challenges.

Geert Egberts Boer

Geert Egberts Boer was the docent of what became Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, from 1876 to 1902. 
Boer was born in Roderwolde, in the Netherlands and graduated in 1864 from the theological school in Kampen. Afterwards he joined the ministry. In 1873, Boer was called to Grand Rapids, Michigan and in 1876, the Synod of the Christian Reformed Church appointed him the first professor of their newly established theological school. Using his own books and a curriculum modeled on the one used in Kampen, Boer opened the school which later became Calvin Theological Seminary and its offshoot Calvin College. Boer is also noted for encouraging the growth of Christian primary education. In 1986, the Boer-Bennink residence hall was opened in Calvin College named after Boer because of his significant contributions to Christian education, the Christian Reformed Church, and Calvin College.

Walter H. Burkholder

Walter Hagemeyer Burkholder (1891â1983) was an American plant pathologist who helped establish the role of bacteria as plant pathogens. He was awarded a Ph.D. by Cornell University in 1917 and subsequently appointed as professor of plant pathology. 
In 1950 he first described the bacteria, "Pseudomonas cepacia", later "Burkholderia" spp., responsible for causing sour skin disease in onions and colonising the rhizosphere of many plant species. Bacterial strains from the "Burkholderia cepacia complex" (Bcc) are opportunistic pathogens in humans with cystic fibrosis and have been implicated in vertebral osteomyelitis in intravenous drug abusers. This complex of at least 9 closely related species or genomovars is currently the focus of research because of their remarkable variability as plant and human pathogens, saprophytes, and biocontrol and bioremediation agents.
Burkholder was a member of the Society of American Bacteriologists.

<doc id="18874485" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18874485" title="Illegal entry">
Illegal entry

Illegal entry is the act of foreign nationals arriving in or crossing the borders into a country in violation of its immigration law.
Migrants from nations that do not have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the United StatesâMexico border, the Mona Channel between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the Strait of Gibraltar, Fuerteventura, and the Strait of Otranto. These methods are often dangerous: migrants have been known to suffocate in shipping containers, boxcars and trucks, sink in shipwrecks caused by unseaworthy vessels or die of dehydration or exposure during long walks without water.
Human smuggling is the practice of intermediaries aiding unlawful migrants in crossing international borders for financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, human trafficking. A human smuggler will facilitate illegal entry into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, fraud, or deception to obtain and transport people, usually for the purpose of forced labor or prostitution at the destination.
By country.
India.
Presently, India is constructing a fence along the border to restrict illegal traffic from Bangladesh. The Indo-Bangladeshi barrier is long. The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists, prevent smuggling, and to bring a close to illegal immigration from Bangladesh.
Australia.
In Australia, mandatory immigration detention was revived in 1992 for all foreigners who arrive in Australia without a visa. That only "border applicants" are subject to detention has sparked criticism, as it is claimed to unfairly discriminate against certain migrants.
Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel was the name used by the Australian Defence Force or Australian Coastwatch for maritime vessels which were suspected to be attempting to reach Australia without authorisation. In practice, these boats were often carrying asylum seekers who had departed from Indonesia on the final leg of a journey which started in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan after paying people smugglers.
Palestine.
During 1933-1948, the British government limited Jewish immigration to Palestine with quotas, and following the rise of Nazism to power in Germany, illegal immigration to Palestine commenced. The illegal immigration was known as Aliyah Bet ("secondary immigration"), or "Ha'apalah", and was organized by the Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, as well as by the Irgun. Immigration was done mainly by sea, and to a lesser extent overland through Iraq and Syria. Beginning in 1939 Jewish immigration was further restricted, limiting it to 75,000 individuals for a period of five years after which immigration was to end completely. During World War II and the years that followed until independence, "Aliyah Bet" became the main form of Jewish immigration to Palestine. Despite British efforts to curb the illegal immigration, during the 14 years of its operation, 110,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine.
Turkey.
Turkey, which is a transit point for unauthorized migrants trying to reach Europe, has been accused of being unable to secure its borders with Greece. Since 1996, 40 unauthorized migrants have been killed by mines, after entering Greek territory in Evros. In 2001, about 800 illegal immigrants were rescued by the Greek coastguards after a fire broke out on board the Turkish-flagged "Brelner", believed to have set sail from the Turkish port of Ä°zmir, probably en route to Italy. Once in July 2004 and a second time in May 2006, Hellenic Coast Guard ships were caught on film cruising as near as a few hundred meters off the Turkish coast and abandoning clandestines to the sea. This practice resulted in the drowning of six people between Chios and Karaburun on 26 September 2006 while three others disappeared and 31 were saved by Turkish gendarmes and fishermen. Three of the drowned were Tunisians, one was Algerian, one Palestinian and the other Iraqi. The three disappeared were also Tunisians.
As a result of bilateral negotiations, a readmission agreement was signed between Turkey and Greece in November 2001 and went into effect in April 2002. For third country nationals, this protocol gives the parties 14 days to inform each other of the number of persons to be returned after the date of illegal entry. For nationals of the two countries the authorities can make use of simplified procedures. But the strict application of the agreement is reported to have retrograded as of 2003.
China.
People's Republic of China is building a security barrier along its border with North Korea to prevent defectors or refugees from North Korea from entering the country illegally.
On May 13, 2004, the People's Republic of China sentenced Yang Jianli, a Chinese dissident with U.S. residency, to five years in prison for espionage and illegal entry.
Hong Kong.
The illegal entry of Vietnamese refugees was a concern for the Hong Kong government for 25 years. The issue was first resolved in 2000. Between 1975 and 1999, 143,700 Vietnamese refugees were resettled in other countries and more than 67,000 Vietnamese migrants were repatriated.
Iran.
On 23 March 2007, 15 British Royal Navy personnel, from HMS "Cornwall", were surrounded by the Navy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and were subsequently detained off the Iraq-Iran coast. Iran's director general for Western European affairs, Ibrahim Rahimpour, said that the British boats had made "illegal entry" into Iranian territorial waters and that the personnel "were arrested by border guards for investigation and questioning". On 24 March, the Iranian Fars News Agency said the navigational equipment seized on the British boats shows the sailors were aware that they were operating in Iranian waters. On the same day, General Ali Reza Afshar, a top military official, said the sailors had confessed to illegal entry into Iran's waters.
Egypt.
On January 25, 2008, Egyptian security forces blocked almost all illegal entry points along the border with Gaza to try to stem the flow of Palestinians wanting to leave. Egyptian forces in riot gear erected barbed wire and chain-link fences along the border to prevent more Palestinians from crossing.
Thailand.
On June 5, 2006, 231 Hmong refugees fleeing Laos were detained by police in Amphoe Khao Kho, Phetchabun Province for illegal entry into Thailand. The Hmong were seeking asylum at the province's Ban Huay Nam Khao, where about 6,500 ethnic Hmong are being sheltered, but the Thai military refused to allow them to stay. Most of the Hmong claim they fought against the communists in the Secret War.
Malaysia.
Most unlawful migrants to Malaysia are from nearby Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia.
United States.
There are an estimated half a million illegal entries into the United States each year. Six to seven million people reside in the United States after having evaded the Immigration Inspectors or Border Patrol. 
The illegal entry of non-nationals into the United States is a misdemeanor according to the Immigration and Nationality Act, which prohibits non-nationals from entering or attempting to enter the United States at any time or place which has not been designated by an immigration officer, and also prohibits non-nationals from eluding inspection by immigration officers.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection is responsible for apprehending individuals attempting to enter the United States illegally. The United States Border Patrol is its mobile uniformed law enforcement arm, responsible for deterrence, detection and apprehension of those who enter the United States without authorization from the government and outside the designated ports of entry.
The unfenced, rural mountainous and desert border between Arizona and Mexico has become a major entrance area for unlawful migration to the United States, due in part to the increased difficulty of crossing illegally into California. The recent tightening of border enforcement has disrupted the traditional circular movement of many migrant workers from Mexico by increasing the costs and risks of crossing the border, thereby reducing their rate of return migration to Mexico. Each year there are several hundred migrant deaths along the Mexico-U.S. border. Often, migrants employ "coyotes", smugglers who promise a safe passage into the United States and are paid thousands of dollars per person they assist in crossing the border. The difficulty and expense of the journey has prompted many migrant workers to stay in the United States longer or
indefinitely.
According to the U.S. Border Patrol, there were 1,954 migrant deaths along the Mexico-U.S. border between 1998 and 2004. In 1993, 283 Chinese migrants attempted illegal entry into the United States via a sea vessel; ten of them arrived dead.
United Kingdom.
A recent study into irregular immigration to the United Kingdom states that "most irregular migrants have committed administrative offences rather than a serious crime". In 2004, illegal entry action was initiated against 36,550 migrants; it was estimated that more migrants overstay their visa than enter clandestinely, hence considered unlikely that there are large numbers of people crossing UK borders without permission.
Many of the routes for clandestine entry are very dangerous. There were 72 documented deaths that are thought to have occurred while entering UK between 1993 and 2002. The most common cause of death while entering the UK (61 of the deaths recorded) was suffocation in a lorry while being smuggled into the UK by ferry; Others drowned in the English Channel, froze to death as stowaways on an aeroplane and were crushed by trains in the Channel Tunnel.

Mallee Catchment Management Authority

The Mallee Catchment Management Authority (CMA) region is the largest catchment area in Victoria, Australia, covering approximately 3.9 million hectares â almost one-fifth of the State. 
Mallee Region.
The regional population is approximately 65,000, with Mildura the major urban centre. The north and east of the region is bordered by the River Murray, its anabranches, tributary channels, floodplains and associated wetland systems. In the south, north flowing intermittent streams, including the Yarriambiack Creek and Tyrrell Creek terminate in a number of ephemeral wetland complexes including the Wirrengren Plain, Lake Corrong and Lake Tyrrell.
There are over 900 wetlands in the Mallee CMA region, 14 of which are listed as ânationally significantâ in the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia. In addition, the wetland and floodplain ecosystems of the Hattah Lakes and Lindsay, Wallpolla and Mulcra Islands have been recognised by the Murray Darling Ministerial Council as âicon sitesâ to receive environmental water under the Murray Darling Basin Commissionâs Living Murray initiative.
Land use in the Mallee is diverse with agriculture the most economically important industry and the River Murray a major influence. The regionâs semi-arid climate supports primary industries including cereals, prime lambs, citrus, nuts, vegetables, vine and fruit growing activities. Many of these horticultural sectors have faced a challenging period in recent years due to the drought.
Program Highlights.
A key focus for the Mallee CMA over the past decade has been helping communities to develop and increase their ability to engage in the process of protecting and improving the areas natural resources.
Initiatives such as Landcare, Waterwatch, the Frontage Action Plan Project, Environmental Action Planning, and indigenous programs have all been instrumental in building community capacity and knowledge of regional natural resource management issues.
The voluntary involvement of over 150 local farmers in such programs as the Environmental Management Action Planning project signals a turning point in the direction of farming to include environmental considerations, while the voluntary contributions of Landcare groups, local schools and other community organisations in restoring frontages along the River Murray highlights the capacity of the community to implement environmental change.
Indigenous Cultural Heritage has become a key consideration of the Authority across all units, programs and projects. The Indigenous Cultural Heritage training program has boosted the capacity of the local indigenous community to identify key cultural heritage sites to ensure their ongoing protection. Undertaking research to inform future decisions in terms of natural resource management in the Mallee region has also been a key focus of the CMA over the past decade. With salinity one of the most significant threats to be faced by the Mallee region over the next 20 years, the aerial mapping of over 25,500 kilometres from Nyah to the South Australian border will provide data essential for future decision making in this area.
Future Challenges.
The challenges of the vast Mallee region are both diverse and complex, demanding strong leadership, strategic planning and coordination. The future looks set to present many challenges with the continuing prolonged drought, low inflows into the Murray system, demand for water resources, rising salinity levels and climate change. Changing socioeconomic conditions, urban migration and land-use change will also present challenges for the Mallee region in the future.
The Mallee CMA plans to continue to demonstrate its commitment and ability to embrace the challenges of increased natural resource management responsibilities through its key goals of business excellence, leadership and partnership and community engagement.

Quality Intellectual Property Metric

What is QIP Metric?
QIP (Quality Intellectual Property) Metric is an international standard, developed by Virtual Socket Interface Alliance (VSIA) for measuring IP or SIP (Silicon intellectual property) quality and examining the practices used to design, integrate and support the SIP. SIP hardening is required to facilitate the reuse of IP in IC design.
Background and Importance.
Application is driving the need for higher complexity and performance IP-based System-on-a-chip (SoC) design. One solution is the reuse of high quality IP. IP quality is the key to successful SoC designs, but it is one of the SoCâs most challenging problems.
SIP Quality Measure Framework.
Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP, which was set up by Hong Kong government) and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) started to develop a SIP verification and quality measures framework in 2005, based on QIP metric. The objective is to develop a technical framework for SIP quality measures and evaluation based on QIP.
Third-party SIP evaluation service is provided by HKSTP, so that IP integrators can know the quality of their desired SIP cores.
Soft and Hard SIP.
There are soft SIP and hard SIP verification and quality measures.

Tommaltach mac Indrechtaig

Tommaltach mac Indrechtaig (died 790) was a King of Dal nAraide in Ulaid (Ulster) and possible King of all Ulaid. He was the son of Indrechtach mac Lethlobair (died 741), a previous King of Dal nAraide. He ruled from 776 to 790 and as King of all Ulaid from 789 to 790. He belonged to the main ruling dynasty of the Dal nAraide known as the UÃ­ ChÃ³elbad based in Mag Line, east of Antrim town in modern county Antrim.
Tommaltach made his bid for the Dal nAraide throne in 776 supported by Eochaid mac Fiachnai (died 810) of the Dal Fiatach, son of the reigning King of Ulaid. They were successful at the Battle of Drong. They were successful and the incumbent king CinÃ¡ed Ciarrge mac Cathussaig and his ally, DÃºngal king of the UÃ­ Tuirtri (an Airgialla tribe west of Lough Neagh), were slain. In 783 Tommaltach had to defend his position and won the Battle of Duma Achad (Dunaughey, modern County Antrim) against his internal enemies.
Upon the death of Fiachnae mac Ãedo RÃ³in (died 789), King of Ulaid, the Dal Fiatach became involved in a civil feud and Tommaltach made himself King of Ulaid. Tommaltach however died the next year. That same year in 790, a slaughter of the Dal Fiatach by the DÃ¡l nAraidi occurred. This is listed after his death notice for that year in the annals but yearly events are not necessarily listed in chronological order. Though listed as king of Ulaid in the kinglists in the "Book of Leinster" he is only awarded the title King of Dal nAraide at his death notice in the "Annals of Ulster".
His grandson Lethlobar mac Loingsig (died 873) was also a King of Ulaid.

Mexican Whip-poor-will

The Mexican Whip-poor-will, ("Antrostomus arizonae"), is a medium-sized (22â27Â cm) nightjar from the southwestern United States and Mexico. The Whip-poor-will is more often heard within its range, but less often seen. It is named onomatopoeically after its song.
This bird previously was lumped with the Eastern Whip-poor-will, however with both types having different ranges and vocalizatons, the eggs having different coloration, and DNA sequencing showing enough differentation, it was determined enough evidence was available to separate the 2 types into different species.
Adults have mottled plumage: the upperparts are grey, black and brown; the lower parts are grey and black. They have a very short bill and a black throat. Males have a white patch below the throat and white tips on the outer tail feathers; in the female, these parts are light brown.
Ecology.
Their habitat is woodlands of southwestern United States, and Mexico. These birds forage at night, catching insects in flight, and normally sleep during the day. Whip-poor-wills nest on the ground, in shaded locations among dead leaves, and usually lay two eggs at a time. The bird will commonly remain on the nest unless almost stepped upon.

Hickory Hill (Ashland, Virginia)

Hickory Hill is an estate in Hanover County, Virginia. The 3,300 acre former plantation is located approximately north of the independent city of Richmond and east of the incorporated town of Ashland.
History.
The Hickory Hill property was long an appendage to Shirley Plantation in Charles City County, much of it having come into possession of the Carter family by a deed dated March 2, 1734. The Carters were among the First Families of Virginia. Robert "King" Carter (1663â1732) served as an acting royal governor of Virginia and was one of its wealthiest landowners in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.
Robert Carter the younger gave 500 acres of land known as Hickory Hill to his daughter Ann Butler Carter and her betrothed on the occasion of her wedding in December 1819 to William Fanning Wickham. William Fanning Wickham, son of the famous defender of Aaron Burr, John Wickham esq., though a Richmond lawyer, soon adopted the life of a Planter, raising wheat as his cash crop and he and Ann eventually grew Hickory Hill to encompass 3300 acres. Once Hickory Hill became their modest home, the frame dwelling over an English basement grew with the plantation, eventually becoming a brick, seventy five hundred square foot Greek Revival mansion. Her sister, Anne Hill (nÃ©e Carter) Lee, was the mother of Robert E. Lee. The Lee family visited often, before during and after the War Between the States. General Lee's daughter Mary was proposed to by her childhood sweetheart Orton Williams in Hickory Hill's large parlor. She declined, never disclosing her reasons, but it is thought that the war had so hardened the sweet boy she had known, that he was gone and an angry, hard man had taken his place. Orton was later captured and hung the following morning as a spy. His last letter was written to Mary Lee in which he proclaimed his innocence. General R.E. Lee wrote that this cruel deed was done to Orton in vindictiveness, simply to harm Lee and his family.
William and Ann's son, Williams Carter Wickham (1820-1888), became a notable lawyer, judge, politician and soldier. Williams Wickham had been a member of Virginia's secession convention and voted against leaving the Union. However once Abraham Lincoln demanded Virginia fight to enslave her sister states or be subjugated herself, Wickham knew where his duty lay, and the die was cast; he threw his whole might behind the Confederate cause. Williams Wickaham had raised a local cavalry company, the Hanover Dragoons at Hickory Hill in 1859, which he captained until the spring of 1861. When Virginia called for volunteers Wickham and his Dragoons rode into Ashland, Virginia and enlisted in the Confederate Army. The Hanover Dragoons became Company G, 4th Virginia Cavalry and Wickham was elected Lieutenant Colonel. After having been severely wounded at the Battle of Williamsburg by a sabre thrust through the body, he returned home it was thought, to die. God, his own strong constitution and loving attention pulled him through the crises and opened greater possibilities to aid his country. Wickham, knew every byroad in that portion of the county and since he was at home behind the Yankee lines he was familiar with all of the Union military activity in the area also. Because of this, Jeb Suart, when beginning his famed ride around McClellan left his troops at their jump off point and taking along Rooney Lee, who wished to see his bride, rode to Hickory Hill. Rooney of course visited with Charlotte, but Stuart set with Colonel Wickham late into the night and made his plans for the marrow before drifting off to sleep in a chair. Before sunup Stuart and Lee where back with their troops ready to begin their ride. 
Though Wickham had no formal military training he was a brilliant man and excelled in the art of war. Having been a hard and dependable fighter through all of Stuarts campaigns with the Army of Northern Virginia he quickly rose to the rank of Brigadier General of Cavalry under Jeb Stuart, On June 26, 1863, General Robert E. Lee's son, General Rooney Lee was brought to Hickory Hill by his brother Robert Lee Jr. so that he could be with his wife, Charlotte Wickham Lee and his mother and sisters who were staying at Hickory Hill while he recuperated from the severe wound he received at the Battle of Brandy Station in 1863. Having learned of his staying there, a Federal raiding party was sent to capture him in order to hold him as a hostage for a Federal Officer. 
At the time he was staying in the plantation office with his nurse - brother Robert Lee, Jr. About two weeks after arriving, Robert Jr. and Mrs. Wickham stepped out onto the front veranda after having just finished breakfast and heard shots ringing out in the hickory grove down by the gate. She sent Robert to put a stop to the sport. While riding to the gate he espied the raiders approach shortly before they reached the mansion. Wheeling his horse he raced back to his brother in the Plantation's office and attempted to quickly remove General R. Lee the younger, who protested that he himself had always paroled wounded prisoners and had no doubt the Yankees would do the same, not knowing that they were coming specifically to capture him. 
Robert Jr. escaped into the formal garden on the grounds and burrowed into the hedges from where he watched the whole affair unfolded; periodically creeping closely to see if all was clear but was several times turned back. Meanwhile, Scott, their faithful manservant, led all but one of the officer's horses to safety. Afterwards he was captured, escaped and returned. The Yankees, rightly or wrongly believed that they had been taken across the Pamunkey River into Caroline County to their Uncle Williams Carter's plantation, North Wales. Not content with their capture of the General, horses, wagon and other items looted from Hickory Hill, the Yankees sent a raiding party to North Wales to steal the officer's blooded horses. Not discovering them, they proceeded to beat the old gentleman to death, but he did not disclose the whereabouts of the boys horses. General Rooney Lee was captured in the Hickory Hill Plantation office and carted away on a stolen wagon while his wife, two children, mother and sisters stood watching. Afterwards, even with the weight of Gettysburg upon him, R.E.Lee always the gentleman wrote to his daughter in law Charlotte (whom he referred to as daughter)while he penned up in Hagerstown, Maryland waiting for the waters to fall so he could cross back into Virginia: "The consequences of war are horrid enough at best, surrounded by all the amelioration of civilization and Christianity. I am very sorry for the injuries done the family at Hickory Hill and particularly that our dear old Uncle Williams, in his eightieth year, should be subjected to such treatment. But we cannot help it and must endure it" While he was held in a damp cell in Fortress Monroe, his children died of scarlet Fever and his wife Charlotte wasted away. General Robert E. Lee always expressed the opinion that she died of a broken heart. 
In 1864 he was elected to the Confederate Congress and was a member of the Hampton Roads Peace Commission. He served as a lawyer and jurist in Hanover before and After the war. In November 1865, he was named the President of the war-ravaged Virginia Central Railroad, which ran westerly from Richmond. Needing capitol to expand and update, the Virginia Central was merged with the Covington and Ohio Railroad to become the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O), with the goal of completing a railroad link to the Ohio River. Williams Wickham is credited with attracting transcontinental railroad builder Collis P. Huntington and fresh financing from New York City to complete the task by 1873. Wickham remained active with the C&O through a receivership and financial reorganization, and was at his office in Richmond working when he died in 1888. 
The frame portion of the house at Hickory Hill was partially destroyed by a fire in 1875, and the family resided in the three story brick addition which had been erected in 1857, while the damaged frame portion was rebuilt with a magnificent Flemish bond structure over the original brick English basement. The house was built to commercial standards of the day, and consequently has remained unusually solid. All of the sills were made of sandstone and all of the lentils granite. The back veranda is made of a checkerboard pattern of slate and marble, surrounded by massive granite beams. The rich mahogany doors and ornamental plaster, mantels, and heart pine flooring still remain and have been preserved to meet modern living needs, but in such a way as to be virtually unchanged. One of the mansions architectural gems is the massive two story great hall with double balconies.
Hickory Hill produced wheat (its major crop), corn, oats, and other fruits and vegetables. Unlike other Hanover County plantations, which sold locally, Hickory Hill sold its produce in Richmond where it brought a higher price. It had its own stop, Wickham Station, just below the manor house on the former Virginia Central Railroad. Clay was mined on the property and baked into bricks alongside the railroad tracks and all of the brick used in Hickory Hill's construction was made on the plantation. It is also thought that many of the bricks that rebuilt Richmond after the War Between the States came from Hickory Hill. This revenue greatly aided in maintaining the lifestyle the Wickham's had enjoyed prior to the War. 
General Wickham remained at Hickory Hill until his death in 1888 at which time his son, Henry Taylor Wickham was master of the plantation. the house changed little for over fifty years, but in 1915 five bathrooms were added to the mansion, and probably at this same time a coal fired steam boiler heating system was installed. A gas shed and carbide gas generator was also added and gas for lighting was piped to the mansion, the kitchen and office. the house was not disturbed again until it was wired for electricity in 1930. 
The mansion, though fallen into disrepair remains surrounded by the Plantation office, kitchen, smokehouse, Mammy's house, root cellar, carriage house and the first floor brick of the barn and stables. The property remained in the Wickham family for six generations, not coming out until approximately 2005, when it was purchased by Shannon and Lesia Pritchard. The Pritchard's have meticulously restored the Mansion and some of the dependencies to their former glory and plan on continuing to do so until the full restoration is complete. The property now consists of the mansion, out buildings, fifty acres. A 546 acre viewshed was placed around the remaining estate that can never be developed, thus preserving the mansion, grounds and setting for the foreseeable future.

<doc id="18875034" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18875034" title="Karma Gon Monastery">
Karma Gon Monastery

Karma Gon Monastery, the original monastery of the Karma Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhism, was founded in the 12th century by DÃ¼sum Khyenpa, the 1st Karmapa Lama in eastern Tibet at the age of 76.
Karma Gon ("karma dgon", also "Karma Dansa", "karma gdan sa"; Chinese, "Gama Si"), is located on the eastern bank of the Dzachu River in Chamdo, eastern Tibet. Karma Dansa was the cradle of the karma kagyupas. When established the Karmapa had gathered 1000 monks around him here. Karma Gon was named as Karma Dansa as an administrative unit and the Chinese Ming Court enlarged the monasteryâs jurisdiction by adding the Mekongâs middle and upper reaches. It was then also called "Gama Dansa Si" in Chinese. The Karma Kagyu lineage also known as 'Diamond Way Buddhism' established first in Karma Gon has now spread to western countries where 500 centers of this school of Mahayana have been established.
Other sources, claim it was founded in 1184 by ChÃ¶dzin Gemphel("chos âdzin dge âphel"), the late 1st Karmapa DÃ¼sum Khyenpa ("dus gsum mkhyen pa").
History.
History records that Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama gave the title of "Situ" to his disciple, Chokyi Gyaltsen (1377â1448), and appointed him as the Master of Studies at Karma Gon. Earlier than this incarnation, there were two others namely, Yehse Nyingpo and Ringowa Ratnabhadra. After Situ Chokyi Gyaltsen, the second Situ in the list was Tashi Namgyal (1450â97) who was ordained Thongwa DÃ¶nden, 6th Karmapa Lama and put in charge of the Karma Gon.
The third Situ was Tashi Paljor (1498â1541) followed by the Situ Chokyi Gocha (1542â85); both were involved in developing the Karma Gon Monastery. They are credited with creating a fine library, apart from embellishing the monastery walls with rare paintings and carvings. Most of these were reportedly destroyed during the Cultural Revolution by the communist regime, except for a few old buildings that still remain. The fourth Situpa was Situ Tashi Paljor who identified Miko Dorjee as the 8th Karmapa and who also became his teacher. The Fifth Situpa Chokyi Gyaltsen was honoured with a red Crown by Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama for his spiritual attainments. The Tai Situpas with their roots in the Kham region of eastern Tibet always played a significant role in identifying the Karmapa Incarnations. The sixth Tai Situpa was Mipal Chogyal Rabten (1658â82) known for his miracle performing achievements, who was followed by Mawe Nyima (son of King Lin) who had a premature death. The eighth Tai Situpa, Chokyi Jungne (1700â74) was the most distinguished scholar who went to establish Palpung Monastery in 1717 after which the importance of the Karma Gon monastery has waned.
Structure.
The hundred-pillar Assembly Hall was once one of the largest in Tibet, containing 12 chapels and magnificent murals illustrating the deeds of the Buddha and historical scenes relating to the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. It used to contain three gilded brass images of the 'Buddhas of the Three Times' in its inner sanctum and there was a large central image of Shakyamuni Buddha on a sandalwood throne which 8th Karmapa personally designed. The surviving buildings show a remarkable synthesis of Tibetan, Naxi (Jang) and Chinese styles which attest to the influence of the monastery as far south as Lithang. There a number of statues and other relics, some of them ancient, and an upstairs room sealed off with a curtain of chain mail where 100 monks study the commentaries of the 8th Karmapa.
In the 13th century, Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama, considered a child prodigy, had become an ordained monk at the age of 22. He had received the complete series of Kargyu teachings and was the dharma protector of Kargyu lineage. He was the 2nd Gyalwa Karmapa. During his visit to this monastery, after noting the poor state of repair of the monastery, he had ensured during his time, complete restoration of the monastery to its original state.
Restoration.
The Government of Peoples Republic of China and the Tibet Autonomous Region have undertaken an extensive programme and provided funds for the maintenance and restoration of a number of famous monasteries including the Karma-gdan-sa monastery of the Karma Kargyu sect.

Frank Chirkinian

Frank Chirkinian (June 3, 1926 â March 4, 2011) was an Armenian-American CBS Sports producer and director. He is most notable for his work on golf coverage, though he also directed coverage of the Winter Olympics, the United States Open Tennis Championships, college and professional American football, auto racing and the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. He died at his Florida home after suffering from lung cancer. Shortly before his death, Chirkinian was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame; he was inducted posthumously.
Early life.
Chirkinian was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Golf coverage.
Chirkinian was known as the 'father of televised golf' for the impact he had on golf broadcasting. He came to the attention of CBS after he impressed with his direction of the 1958 PGA Championship. Recruited by the network, who had no one with expertise in the relatively new field of golf broadcasting, he went on to be executive producer of CBS's golf coverage from 1959 until 1996. During his time at CBS, he was nicknamed 'The Ayatollah' for his brusque, uncompromising approach to directing broadcasts. Chirkinian was particularly well regarded for the coverage of the Masters Tournament that he oversaw for four decades, working closely with the authorities at Augusta National to ensure they were satisfied.
Chirkinian was responsible for a number of innovations in the filming and presentation of golf. He ensured as many microphones as possible were placed around the golf course to pick up the sounds of the tournament and golfers' conversations, rather than having commentators talk over silent footage. He showed as many golf shots as possible, cutting quickly from player to player to keep up the pace of the broadcast, unafraid of focusing on the game's stars. The use of multiple cameras was introduced during Chirkinian's tenure, including high-angle cameras mounted in trees and on blimps for the first time.
Chirkinian said that he was most proud of being the first to display golfers' scores relative to par, rather than cumulatively, making it simpler to work out how they were faring relative to the rest of the field. Most of all, Chirkinian thought it important to allow coverage to focus on golfers and the shots they made, and was critical of recent innovations in golf broadcasting that he saw as distracting and unnecessary.
Other media.
Chirkinian appeared as himself in the Kevin Costner film "Tin Cup".
Honors and awards.
Chirkinian won four Emmys and two Peabody Awards during his career. In 2007 he was awarded the Sports Lifetime Achievement Award and inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. At the time of his death, he was scheduled to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on May 9, 2011. At the induction ceremony, a message Chirkinian videotaped shortly before his death was broadcast to the assembled golfing luminaries.

Faster Louder Better!

Faster Louder Better! is the first official release from Calgary's The Skitzos on Longshot Music. It was released October 2, 2007 to wide Albertan acclaim on red, white or black 7" vinyl. It has gone on to sell out and is currently only available as a collectors item in Western Canada.
Background.
February Session.
Faster Louder Better! was recorded in two separate sessions at Echo Base studio with Casey Lewis as producer. The first session was in February 2006, and was originally called the 'Cincinnati Necktie Session'. Three songs were recorded. These were 'Set It Off', 'Sinking Fast' and 'The Terror Song'. A cover of The Ramones 'Howling At The Moon' was also to be recorded but wasn't finished due to time constraints. The Skitzos were under serious pressure to finish the recordings as their car blew up driving to the studio during the freezing winter in Calgary. This is rumored to be the reason why not all of the tracks were completed. Much of the material was to be finished the night before while they spent the night drinking 180 proof Vodka. Some of the members were still drunk from the night before when they finally arrived at the studio. The band was also allegedly involved in many physical fights during the writing process which also resulted in the delay of release, these were mostly between Mark and Josh. Aaron and Ryder chose to play ping-pong during these fights. It is unknown who the winner was.
August Session.
The next session was in August 2006, again at Echo Base. Three more tracks were recorded these were 'Watch Out', 'S.K.I.T.Z.O.S' and 'I'm A Pretender'. It is during this session that the police incident took place. The Skitzos made a trip to Edmonton on August 9, directly after finishing in the studio, where they debuted these new tracks for the first time live. The reception was warm, except by a drunk old woman who tried to fight Mark and Aaron as they waited for the show to start, they had to climb on top of their touring van to get away. Furthermore, the band got this show shut down as the police were called to the venue after Mark and Aaron were caught urinating on a residential complex directly behind the venue.

Chandamama

Chandamama is a classic Indian monthly magazine for children, famous for its illustrations. It also published long-running mythological/magical stories that ran for years. Originally, Chandamama" was started in Telugu by B.Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani, noted Telugu Film Producer's. It was edited by Kodavatiganti Kutumba Rao, a very close friend of Chakrapani and a literary colossus in Telugu Literature, who edited it for 28 years, till his death in August 1980.
The Magazine.
The main features of Indian Mythology was completely written by him. Kutumbarao also developed the magazine by encouraging young writers in Telugu and adapted them to suit the Telugu written style that he made so popular in Andhra and the Telugu speaking people for decades. Some of the stories and the folklore features were written by Dasari Subrahmanyam, who made the serials like Patala Durgam, etc., also very popular
It was revamped in November 2008 and has since gone contemporary in terms of language, presentation, artwork, and content. While it continues to carry old favourites like Vikram-Betal and mythological tales, there have been several new additions including contemporary stories, adventure serials, sports, technology, news pages, etc. Considering the new trends in children's literature and the emerging importance given to academic study and analysis of the same, Chandamama has striven to keep its editorial policies in line with the times. As the oldest brand in the field, Chandamama has taken up the responsibility of delivering entertaining, sensitive, and educational literature for its young readers.
Chandamama is published in 13 languages (including English), and has a readership of about 200,000.
Unique style of storytelling.
The magazine started the unique trend of telling a story, almost always bound by a common thread of moral values, with a grandparents' style of storytelling in the most flexible third-person narrative mode, on print.
The stories published have been drawn from numerous historical and modern texts in India, as well as from other countries. Mythology, epics, fables, parables and even useful hearsay were spun suitably to feed the impressionable minds so that they seek the right direction in life, even while entertaining them thoroughly. In fact Chandamama continues to be the perfect example for the now popular term 'edutainment' !
The stories embedded in the never-ending story of King VikramÄditya and Vetala (Vampire), an adaptation of an ancient Sanskrit work Baital Pachisi, brought wide repute to this magazine, and were also featured in popular TV serials. In each issue, the Vetala, in order to prevent him fulfill a vow, poses a typical catch-22 question to king VikramÄditya, involving a moral dilemma. The wise king answers correctly, and is thus defeated by the Vetala, forcing the king do it all over again, and again.
History.
The first edition of Chandamama was released in July, 1947. The founder editor of the magazine was B.Nagi Reddy who later became a leading film producer in South India. Chakrapani, a friend of Nagi Reddy, was the force behind magazine, and his vision, perception and understanding of the target readership brought name and fame to the magazine.
Chandamama was first published in Telugu and Tamil (as Ambulimama) in July 1947. Kannada edition first appeared in July 1949 followed by Hindi in August 1949. Marathi (as Chandoba) and Malayalam (as Ambili Ammavan) editions appeared in April 1952 followed by Gujarati in 1954, English in 1955, Oriya (as Jahnamamu) and Sindhi in 1956, Bengali in August 1972, Punjabi in 1975, Assamese in 1976, Sinhala in 1978, Sanskrit in April 1984 and Santali in 2004. The Punjabi, Sindhi and Sinhala editions were published only for a short period. No English editions were published from October 1957 to June 1970. The magazine ceased publication in 1998, owing to labour disputes. However, the magazine relaunched a year later and continues to be published to this day. It is available in 12 Indian languages and English.
For many decades, Chandamama's illustrators defined the look of the magazine. They included such names as M.T.V. Acharya, T. Veera Raghavan, who signed his work as Chithra; Vaddadi Papaiah, who signed as Vapa; Kesava Rao who signed as Kesava; M. Gokhale; and K. C. Sivasankaran, alias Sankar, who joined Chandamama in the year 1951, and continues to draw even now in 2011, in an unbroken association of 6 decades! Later artists such as Shakthi Dass; M. K. Basha, who signed as Razi; Gandhi Ayya, aka Gandhi; and P. Mahesh (Mahe), also continued the tradition into current times. Initially, the covers were printed in four-colours, while the illustrations inside used line drawings. Each page of Chandamama has an illustration, although in the strict sense of the term, Chandamama is not a comic book, with the exception of the Chitra-katha column.
Ownership.
The magazine has been in family hands since foundation, and the current publisher, B Viswanatha Reddy, continues the tradition after taking over the affairs of the magazine from his father. In 1999, the company was floated as a public limited organization, with Morgan Stanley taking a sizable stake in the company.
The current editor is Prashant Mulekar of Geodesic.
In August 2006, it was reported that Disney was set to buy a stake in Chandamama. In 2007, Chandamama was acquired by technology company Geodesic Information Systems
Chandamama in the 21st Century.
With the acquisition by a technology company, Chandamama has announced that it will digitize and make available much of its content via digital libraries and on the web. In addition, Chandamama Multimedia CDs have also been published.
In late 2007, Chandamama released its revamped internet presence (now more logically found at "chandamama.com", a domain-name it acquired after many years) to better cater to readers who demand information and content beyond the printed publication. It has also tied up with satellite radio service provider Worldspace to bring the Indian story telling tradition live through radio.
In July 2008, the publication launched its online portal in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu apart from English. It declared that all 60 year's publication in all Indian languages would be put online soon.,
Chandamama has stopped publishing in all languages from March 2013, without issuing any press release and without giving any notifications or refund to subscribers. A message was given on the official Facebook page of the magazine on 30 May 2013 saying that they could not publish issues from March 2013 because of technical problems, and the magazine will restart publishing from July 2013 onwards. However, the official website of the magazine also went down in July 2013. Presently the website just says "We are currently doing some enhancement and upgrades to the website.
We will be back soon".It is not yet clear what is going to be the future of the magazine, and whether it is going to be revived in future.
Chandamama website is back on Jan 2014.

Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural

Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural is a non-profit cultural center and bookstore in Sylmar, California. It was founded in 2003 by noted Chicano author Luis J. Rodriguez, his wife Trini Rodriguez, Angelica Loa, and Victor Mendoza (Victor E) of El Vuh. Tia Chucha's provides arts and music workshops and events to the culturally underserved Northeastern San Fernando Valley.
History.
Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural was founded in 2003 next door to Tia Chucha's Cafe Cultural, a coffee shop and bookstore owned by Chicano writer Luis Rodriguez, his wife Trini, and their brother-in-law Enrique Sanchez in Sylmar, CA since 2001. The Centro's founders were Luis Rodriguez, Angelica Loa Perez and Victor Mendoza. They began offering workshops in writing, painting, music, dance, film, theater, reiki healing, and indigenous studies. A resident Danza Azteca group, Temachtia Quetzalcoatl, was formed, as well as natural healing circles for both men and women.
In 2004 the Centro received its 501 (c) 3 tax exempt status.
In 2005, the Centro took over operations of Tia Chucha Press and continues to produce poetry books, distributed by Northwestern University Press. Tia Chucha Press was started in 1989 by Luis Rodriguez in Chicago and since 1991 was run by the nonprofit literary arts organization, the Guild Complex, until the Centro made Tia Chucha Press its publishing wing. This complements the CD production project, Dos Manos Records, that the Centro began in 2003.
The Centro also sponsors weekly Open Mic nights as well as regular film nights, musical events, original theater, author readings, and art exhibits. Since 2006, it also created the only annual literacy & performing arts festival in the San Fernando Valley called "Celebrating Words: Written, Performed & Sung." And we sponsor an arts-based youth empowerment project called "Young Warriors,"
started by teen leaders Mayra Zaragoza and Brian Dessaint.
In January 2007, both the Centro and Tia Chucha's Cafe were forced out of their facility to make way for a high-end laundromat. Given the state of the real estate market at the time, the Centro had to move into a much smaller facility in nearby Lake View Terrace, and the Cafe was closed. In March of that year, the Centro took over the bookstore operation from the Cafe.
That summer the Centro established an annual benefit event called "Celebrating Community & Culture: Si Se Puede/Yes We Can!" at Hollywood's Ford Amphitheatre with such notables as Cheech Marin, John Densmore of the Doors, Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, El Vuh, Xela, Tierra, Upground, Olmeca, Nobuko Miyamoto, and more.
The board also expanded to include leaders in the Chicano, African American, Asian, and European American communities.
By February 2009, Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural & Bookstore leased another space back in Sylmar at the Sylmar Plaza on Hubbard Boulevard and Gladstone Avenue, down the street from Mission Community College. The Centro is now the only multi-arts cultural space and bookstore in the Northeast San Fernando Valley, with some 450,000 people, mostly Mexican/Central Americanâthe second largest Latino community in the United States after East LA (with a sizable African American and growing Asian communities).
The Centro has so far been funded by the LA City Department of Cultural Affairs, the LA County Arts Commission, the California Arts Council, the National Endowment for the Arts, the City of San Fernando, the Liberty Hill Foundation, the Panta Rhea Foundation, the Attias Family Foundation, the Middleton Foundation, the Center for Cultural Innovation, Toyota Sales, among others.
Individual donors have included Bruce Springsteen, John Densmore of the Doors, Lou Adler, Richard Foos, Adrienne Rich, Tom Hayden, Jack Kornfield, David Sandoval, Jesus Trevino, Denise Chavez and the Border Book Festival, Dave Marsh, and the Luis & Trini Rodriguez Family.

Tia Chucha Poets include Pulitzer and National Book Award nominees, National Poetry Slam Champions, and winners of Whiting, Lannan, National Endowment for the Arts, and Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest fellowships and awards, among others. In 1991, the Press became a project of the Guild Complex, a nonprofit literary arts center in Chicago. Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural took over operations of the Press in 2005. Tia Chucha Press books are distributed by Northwestern University Press and sold at all major independent and chain bookstores as well as online outlets like Amazon.com.
Dos Manos Records.
Founded by Luis Rodriguez in 2002, Dos Manos Records became a project of Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural the following year. Dos Manos has released two CDs: "From Earth To Sky: A Collection of Word & Song," a showcase of musicians and spoken word artists from the greater Los Angeles area, and "My Name's Not Rodriguez," featuring Rodriguez reading his poetry accompanied by the music of Ernie Perez with the band, Seven Rabbit. Both are available at CD Baby online store.
Young Warriors.
Founded in 2007, Young Warriors is the Centro's ongoing youth empowerment group. Founded by Mayra Zaragoza, Young Warriors utilizes the arts, dialogue, and indigenous healing practices to help troubled young people. Members have taken part in Mosaic Multicultural Foundation's Men's Conferences, Sisters of the Earth Women's Conferences, and the Koures Youth Symposium, among other events. Issues of gangs, drugs, social issues, the arts, and how to live healthy, whole and dignified lives are discussed. A large mural in collaboration with the LA Mural Project, and several young graffiti artists, was painted in 2008 at an elementary school in Sylmar, CA, among other initiatives.
Major Events.
Celebrating Words: Written, Spoken and Sung.
Begun in 2006, "Celebrating Words: Written, Performed & Sung" is Tia Chucha's Centro's annual outdoor community festival, held each summer in Sylmar.

Seymour Reit

Seymour Victory Reit (11 November 1918 â 21 November 2001) was the author of over 80 children's books as well as several works for adults. Reit was the creator, with cartoonist Joe Oriolo, of the character Casper the Friendly Ghost. Reit started his career working for Fleischer Studios as an animator; he also worked for Jerry Iger and Will Eisner as a cartoonist, and for "Mad Magazine" and several other publications as a humorist.
Biography.
Reit was born in New York City on 11 November 1918 (Armistice Day;. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School and New York University, where he drew cartoons for humorous college magazines. He worked as an in-betweener and inker on the 1939 animated film "Gulliver's Travels", and later became a gag writer for the "Popeye" and "Betty Boop" cartoon series, among others. He also anonymously produced comic strips for Jerry Iger under the Fiction House label. He attended New York University with future "Captain Marvel" writer William Woolfolk; and helped launch Woolfolk's career as a writer of comics by introducing him to Jerry Iger and Will Eisner.
Reit served in World War II in a U.S. Army Air Force camouflage unit tasked with defending the West Coast from a Japanese invasion, and later served in Europe after D-Day. He later wrote a book, "The Amazing Camouflage Deceptions of World War II", drawing on his wartime experience. It contains a version of the urban legend which claims that British aviators taunted the German Army by dropping a wooden bomb on a decoy airfield the Germans had built.
After the war, Reit did cartoon work for "Archie" and "Little Lulu", and wrote gags for some of the new "Casper" animated shorts that were being produced. He also wrote for the TV series "Captain Kangaroo". In 1950 he started working for the publications department of the Bank Street College of Education in New York, and also scripted industrial films and radio shows. In the late 1950s, he began submitting work to "Mad Magazine", ultimately contributing over 60 pieces. One of Reit's articles for "Mad", "The 'Down-To-Earth' Coloring Book," appeared in the summer of 1960 and anticipated (or helped inspire) the faddish publishing boom of "adult" coloring books.
Books.
Reit wrote over 80 books, primarily for children, on a variety of historical, technical, natural, and other subjects. One of his titles for adults, "The Day They Stole the Mona Lisa", written in 1981, is about the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911. In the book, Reit asserted that there were "two" genuine "Mona Lisas" in the world: the one in the Louvre, and an earlier version of the work painted by Leonardo da Vinci which was being held in a bank vault in New Jersey (the so-called "Vernon Mona Lisa"). A long-planned movie adaptation of the book has never materialized, although the Internet Movie Database lists a movie by the same title tentatively planned for 2009.
Selected bibliography.
In addition to those listed here, Reit wrote several books for Golden Press, publishers of the Little Golden Books series, and dozens of other children's books for assorted publishers.

GermÃ¡n Lauro

GermÃ¡n LujÃ¡n Lauro (born 2 April 1984 in Trenque Lauquen, Buenos Aires) is an Argentine shot putter and discus thrower. He is the South American record holder in the shot put both indoors and outdoors with marks of 21.04Â m and 21.26Â m, respectively. His personal best in the discus is 63.55 metres.
Lauro placed sixth in the shot put at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships and the 2012 Olympic Games. He represented his country at the World Championships in Athletics in 2007, 2009 and 2011, although he did not reach the finals. He also competed at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and is a two-time participant at the Pan American Games.
He gradually emerged at the regional level, winning South American youth, junior and under-23 titles. He reached the top of his field at continental level in 2006 with a gold medal in the shot put at the South American Championships in Athletics. He extended his shot put reign with four wins from 2006 to 2011 and won two discus gold medals (2007 and 2009) before taking silver in 2011. He began to make an impact at a greater regional level from 2010 onwards, taking a shot put bronze at the 2011 Pan American Games and two gold medals at the 2012 Ibero-American Championships in Athletics.
Career.
Early career.
GermÃ¡n Lauro was born on 2 April 1984 in Trenque Lauquen in Argentina's Buenos Aires Province. He is a member of the local sports club, Foot Ball Club Argentino. He began training with Carlos Llera, a physical education teacher, while at high school in his home town.
In his first continental competition he won both the shot put and discus throw events at the 2000 South American Youth Championships in Athletics. He also placed seventh in the discus in the Junior Championships that year. His first junior medal came the following year at the 2001 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships, where he was the discus silver medallist behind HÃ©ctor Hurtado. He was seventh in the shot put at the 2001 South American Junior Championships in Athletics and a finalist at the 2001 World Youth Championships in Athletics.
He competed for Argentina in the discus at the 2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics, but didn't make the final round, although he was the shot put and discus runner-up at the South American Juniors (second to Brazil's Gustavo de MendonÃ§a both times). In his final junior year he placed fifth in the discus and twelfth in the shot put at the 2003 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships. He managed only fourth in the shot and third in the discus at the 2003 South American Junior Championships in Athletics.
First senior medals.
He achieved little progress in his first senior year, with his sole medal (a bronze) coming in the discus at the 2004 South American Under-23 Championships in Athletics. He improved his shot put best to 18.17Â metres the next year and placed fourth in the event at the 2005 South American Championships in Athletics.
The 2006 season saw Lauro establish himself in the shot put at the senior level as he began to make effective use of the spin technique. After a fourth place finish at the 2006 Ibero-American Championships in Athletics he broke the Argentine record for the event with a throw of 19.46Â m. At the 2006 South American Championships in Athletics he had a no throw in the discus but excelled in the shot put, taking the gold medal with a mark of 18.97Â m. A South American under-23 record of 19.78Â m came at that year's South American U23 Championships, where he won both the shot put and discus titles. He also extended his personal best in the discus to 60.30Â m, clearing sixty metres for the first time.
He expanded his regional dominance to the discus at the 2007 South American Championships in Athletics, winning both the shot put and discus gold medals. He was a finalist in both events at the 2007 Pan American Games, coming fifth in the shot put and fourth in the discus. His global senior debut followed at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, although he was eliminated in the first round. A throw of 61.78Â m in Buenos Aires marked a season-ending personal best in the discus. He began 2008 in strong form, throwing a national record of 19.88Â m for the shot put in February. A bronze medal in the event followed at the 2008 Ibero-American Championships in Athletics, where he was also fourth in the discus. On his Olympic debut at the 2008 Beijing Games he was knocked out in the qualifying rounds.
Further regional titles.
Lauro defended his shot put and discus titles at the 2009 South American Championships in Athletics, having his season's best marks of 19.20Â m and 60.41Â m there. He gained selection for both events at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, but did not make the final in either event. With few major international events in 2010, his focus that year was the Ibero-American Championships. He was fourth in the discus but reached new distances in the shot put event, taking the silver medal with a significant improvement to 20.43Â m. He was only beaten by Marco Fortes in the last series of throws.
The 2011 South American Championships in Athletics was hosted in his home capital Buenos Aires and he defended his shot put title on the first day of competition. Lauro was dethroned in the discus, however, as he finished runner-up to Brazil's Ronald JuliÃ£o. He represented Argentina in the first round of the shot put at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, but the peak of his season came at the 2011 Pan American Games, where he won the bronze medal with a throw of 20.41Â m.
South American records.
Lauro took the indoor circuit for the first time at the start of 2012. He had national indoor records of 19.86Â m, then 19.89Â m. A South American indoor record of 20.40Â m followed in the first round of the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships and he finished sixth in the final round â the best global placing of his career at that point. In the outdoor season he threw a national record of 20.43Â m in Mar de Plata and claimed a shot put/discus double at the 2010 Ibero-American Championships in Athletics, which included a discus best of 63.55Â m. This qualified him for the events at the 2012 London Olympics and in the Olympic shot put he threw 20.75Â m in qualifying before hurling a personal best of 20.84Â m in the final to finish in sixth place. He performed less well in the discus, finishing 37th in qualifying.
He improved his shot put best further at the start of the next season with marks of 20.89Â m and 20.98Â m in Argentina. At the Doha leg of the 2013 Diamond League he threw a South American record of 21.26Â metres, taking second place in the shot put.

Yamaha Libero (G5)

The Yamaha Libero G5 is a 106 cc, single-cylinder four-stroke motorcycle from India Yamaha Motor. Its predecessor was known as just Yamaha Libero. Unlike Libero G5, Libero had tachometer and round headlights but lacked fuel gauge. However, Libero G5 came with a sporty headlight and fuel gauge, but lacked the tachometer. A new set of air scoops with a honeycomb grille do dual duty; directing airflow over the engine block and also neatly covering the gap between the engine and the fuel tank. The Libero G5âs frame continues to be the tubular dual-cradle type. 
Yamaha has introduced a compulsive pressure wet sump lubrication system in the 106Â cc engine of the Libero G5. This new system works on a constant pressure build-up that is generated by the engine itself thus enables the engine oil/ lubricant to flow evenly over all the engine components, unlike conventional lubrication that works more on gravitational forces thus may not perform as effectively.
Yamaha Libero G5 is particularly made for Indian market. However, Yamaha Libero G5 is also popular in Bangladesh. Ground clearance is a comfortable 173Â mm, enabling the bike to take on speed-breakers and potholes with greater confidence. 
In 2007 Yamaha released an upgraded Libero G5 model with alloy wheels and electric starter. Like most Indian motorcycles, this bike comes with a saree guard to increase the safety of female pillion riders. A less sporty-looking version (with same engine) of this bike is marketed as Yamaha Alba. A bigger cousin of this bike with 125Â cc engine is Yamaha Gladiator. Some similar/competitor bikes are Hero Honda Splendor, Bajaj Platina, Bajaj CT 100. Production of Yamaha Libero G5 ended in 2010.
