Plot.
Vijayapuram is a beautiful hillside hamlet appears serene and restful to a casual passerby. But the happenings there are far from tranquil. Dacoities, burglaries and even kidnappings seem to be commonplace occurrences. One established perpetuator of at least some of the crimes is Kaathavarayan, his secret accomplices being some well-known public figures like the rich young wastrel Veerarajan and the Kuttipatti Zamindar. 
The other dacoit is apparently the mysterious Malaikkallan. Legends are galore on his fabulous wealth, awe-inspiring exploits, contempt for the unprincipled rich, concern for the poor and needy indeed he seems to be running a veritable empire in some hidden hillock no one actually seen him. 
There is also the wealthy middle-aged bachelor Abdul Kareem, who seems to disappear at regular intervals from Vijayapuram, claiming business calls at far-off places. In this hotbed of intrigue and suspicion blooms an innocent rose Poonkothai, daughter of the upright Sokkesa Mudaliar. Veerarajan is the cousin of Poonkothai and desires to marry her, but his evil reputation ensures the impossibility of such an alliance. Having lost her mother at an early age, Poonkothai is brought up by her widowed aunt Kamakshi Ammaal. Kamakshi Ammal's only son Kumaraveeran went missing many years back. 
Faced by stringent public criticism for their failure to tackle the audacious crimes, Sub-Inspector Arumugam arrives in Vijayapuram. But his assistant Constable Karuppiah is a bungling coward and is more a hindrance than a help in his investigations. It is at this juncture that one night when mudaliar is away, Poonkothai is kidnapped. The happenings of that eerie night keep the village tongues wagging for many days thereafter. Two sidekicks of Kathavarayan are found tied and hanging upside down, and a piece of Poonkothai’s jewellery is recovered from them. Kamakshi AmmaaL is found tied-up and unconscious, and a mysterious errand-boy hands over to the attending doctor a herb that revives her at once. Poonkothai is said to be in the custody of Malaikkallan, who has cleverly waylaid Kathavarayan’s men and taken away Poonkothai. Kathavarayan faces the ire and ridicule of Veerarajan at the behest of whom he had engineered Poonkothai’s kidnapping. Goaded by this humiliation, he now sends his men far and wide in search of Poonkothai. Meanwhile Poonkothai is safe in the magnificent hideout of Malaikkallan perceiving his genuine concern for the downtrodden and the reverence with which he is held by his people, her contempt and mistrust turn gradually into admiration and leads to love.
Several confounding twists and turns later the truant pieces of the puzzle fall in place. Kathavarayan and Veerarajan get their well-deserved comeuppance. Malaikkallan and Abdul Kareem both turn out to be the same person who is the long missing Kumaraveeran. All is well that ends with the happy marriage of Poonkothai and Kumaraveeran.

Carpometacarpus

The carpometacarpus is the fusion of the carpal and metacarpal bone, essentially a single fused bone between the wrist and the knuckles. It is a smallish bone in most birds, generally flattened and with a large hole in the middle. In flightless birds, however, its shape may be slightly different, or it might be absent entirely.
It forms the tip of the wing skeleton in birds. To it, most of the primary remiges attach. The alula, by contrast, is formed by the thumb, which does not completely fuse with the other hand-bones. Likewise, the tipmost primaries attach to the phalanx bones.
To non-biologists the carpometacarpus may be best known from buffalo wings. Buffalo wings come in two basic sizes, a large angled one containing three major bones, and a smaller flat one containing only two. The bone missing in the latter is the carpometacarpus.

Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (1956 film)

Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (), also spelt as Alibabavum Narpadhu Thirudargalum, is a 1956 Indian Tamil swashbuckling-adventure film directed and produced by T. R. Sundaram. The film stars M. G. Ramachandran and P. Bhanumathi in the lead roles, while P. S. Veerappa, K. A. Thangavelu and M. G. Chakrapani play supporting roles. It is notably the first colour film made in Tamil language. The film tells the story of a poor woodcutter, whose fortune changes when he learns about a secret cave full of treasures, but he must keep his source of wealth as a secret, in order to lead a peaceful life.
"Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum" was released on 14 January 1956, during the festive occasion of Pongal. A remake of the 1954 Hindi film "Alibaba aur 40 Chor", the film which was also based on the popular story "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" from the "1001 Arabian Nights", became an instant success at the box office. It was later remade in Telugu as "Alibaba 40 Dongalu", which also became successful.
Plot.
Marziana (Bhanumathi) is a popular dancer in Baghdad, who dances to earn a living. The tyrant Sher Khan, commander of the notorious king Amir Kasim Khan, tries to take her by force to his palace. She is rescued by Alibaba (MGR), who fights with Sher Khan and vanquishes him. Marziana and her sidekick Dowlat (K. Sarangkapani) find refuge in Alibaba’s house. Alibaba is a poor woodcutter and lives with his sister Ayisha (Susheela) and servant Bulbul (M. N. Rajam). Marziana learns that they are the siblings of Kasim, who had driven them out at the instigation of his cruel wife Salima (Vidyavati). Marziana and Alibaba later fall in love.
One day, when Alibaba goes to cut wood as usual, he chances upon the cavernous hideout of Abu Hussain (P. S. Veerappa), the notorious leader of forty dacoits, and overhears the secret code to enter and exit the cave. After the dacoits leave, Alibaba uses the code word, enters the hideout and takes some of the looted wealth which he uses to help the poor people around. Both Alibaba and Marziana become wealthy overnight.
Amir Kasim Khan (M. G. Chakrapani) becomes jealous when he hears about his brother's fortune, and wants to find out how Alibaba became rich overnight. Under Salima’s guidance, he invites Alibaba and his household for a feast. Cunningly obtaining the secret of the robbers’ cave from Alibaba, he then orders Alibaba’s arrest, accusing him falsely of attempted murder. Marziana pretends to hail Kasim’s order. She declares that Alibaba had been unfaithful to her and he deserved this retribution. Taking a knife, Marziana acts as though she means to kill Alibaba, but instead cuts the ropes that bind his hands. Alibaba is freed and after defeating Kasim's thugs, escapes with Marziana.
Kasim enters the cave and greedily starts collecting many treasures. Soon he forgets the code word, and is left trapped. The dacoits arrive, and kill him for entering their secret cave. Alibaba visits the cave and is shocked to see his brother dead, later he takes away the corpse. After Kasim's death is publicly announced, Alibaba is declared the king of Baghdad and everyone rejoices. Meanwhile, the dacoits return to their cave and see that Kasim's body is missing. Realising that someone else has entered their cave, they start searching for the mystery person.
From the cobbler Gulam’s (Thangavelu) assertion that the woodcutter Alibaba had become wealthy overnight, Abu Hussain realises that it is Alibaba who discovered the secret of his cave. However, he kills the cobbler afterwards. Having his men hidden inside barrels, Abu Hussain comes to Alibaba’s house disguised as an oil merchant seeking shelter for the night. However, Marziana overhears him whispering to his men hidden in the barrels, and realises his true identity. When she dances at a banquet that Alibaba hosts in honour of the guest, Dowlat and Bulbul roll the barrels one by one into the swirling waters as per the plan. After Marziana unsuccessfully tries to stab the "oil merchant", she exposes him as Abu Hussain and Alibaba is shocked. This leads to a fight between the two men, which results in Abu Hussain kidnapping Marziana and fleeing to the secret cave. Alibaba chases him and reaches the cave, where he kills Abu Hussain after an intense battle. After Alibaba rescues Marziana, they both get married and continue to serve the poor people.
Production.
Development.
The Hindi film "Alibaba aur 40 Chor" was running successfully in Tamil Nadu in 1954. T. R. Sundaram, the owner of the "Modern Theatres" studio had purchased the screenplay and rights to remake the film in Tamil as "Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum". A. J. Dominic was signed as the film's art director, while W. R. Subba Rao and A. L. Narayanan were in charge of the cinematography and dialogues respectively. There was an earlier version of this film under the same title, which released in 1941, starring N. S. Krishnan and T. A. Mathuram.
Casting.
M.G. Ramachandran was cast in the role of Ali Baba, and P.S. Veerappa was cast as the antagonistic leader of the forty thieves. Actress Padmini was initially given the role of the female lead Marziana, but she was subsequently replaced by P. Bhanumathi. MGR's elder brother M. G. Chakrapani was cast in the role of Alibaba's elder brother Kassim. Waheeda Rehman, who would later become a leading actress in Hindi cinema, made her debut in this film as a dancer, appearing in the club music number "Salam Babu Salam Babu ennai parunga".
Filming.
"Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum" was shot entirely on indoor sets, with the exception of a few riding sequences. For changes of scenes, irises and wipes were used. It was also the first Tamil film to be released in color, being colourised through Geva Color. The scenes involving horses were shot at Mysore for ten days, the horses used belonged to the Mysore Reserve Police. The cavernous hideout of the fictional thieves was created at two locations — the outside cave shots with the horses were taken at Mysore, while the inside scenes at the set were taken at Yercaud near Salem. Director T. R. Sundaram brought twenty horses from Mysore for the shoot at Yercaud.
When only a song and a fight sequence were left to be finished, MGR was unable to attend the shoot. Those portions were eventually shot with a body double. In one particular scene, MGR objected to the dialogue where he had to "swear in the name of Allah", as he was then associated with the rationalist DMK party. He suggested that the dialogue be changed to swearing "in the name of my mother", but was finally forced to use the original dialogue. "Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum" eventually became MGR's last collaboration with "Modern Theatres".
Differences.
"Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum" is different from "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" in some ways:
Soundtrack.
The film's original soundtrack was composed by S. Dakshinamurthy, while the lyrics were penned by A. Maruthakasi. A large number of the tracks were re-used from the original film "Alibaba aur 40 Chor". The soundtrack played a key role in the success of the film. The song "Ullasa Ulagam" was later remixed by Pravin Mani and Vidyasagar in the 2008 film "Jayam Kondaan".
Reception.
The May 2012 issue of the South Indian entertainment magazine "Galatta Cinema" wrote that the film's "success was buoyed by the super hit songs 'Azhagaana Ponnu Naan, athuketha kannu than...', [...] and 'En nattamellam oru vettaiyile thane...', which remain evergreen today."
Release.
During the filming of "Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum", another producer announced a film with the same script and his plan to release it before Sundaram's version. However, Sundaram and his team "worked hard" to see that their film released earlier, and achieved the same. "Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum" was released on 14 January 1956, during the festive occasion of Pongal.
Box office.
In addition to being the first color film in Tamil cinema, "Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum" became a huge success at the box office, and successfully ran for over 100 days in theatres. According to one report, the film's "success was largely contributed by a lively screenplay, massive sets never seen before, excellent fight scenes, interesting comedy scenes and evergreen songs ably supported by the lovely pair MGR and Bhanumathi".
Critical reception.
"Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum" was very successful during its theatrical run, and is considered a "landmark" in MGR's acting career. Tamil film historian S. Theodore Baskaran wrote in his book "The Eye of the Serpent", "The film's cast of M.G. Ramachandran as the swash-buckling Alibaba, Bhanumathi as the singing-heroine — two of the most popular artistes of the fifties — and Thangavelu as the comedian was the main factor contributing to it's huge success. The screen villain of the fifties, P.S. Veerappa's portrayal of the heartless Abu Hussain was memorable".
In May 2012, entertainment magazine "Galatta Cinema" labelled the film as "one of the finest action packed entertainers with fantastic songs and dances". The critic further mentioned "Though MGR scored through his heroics, Bhanumathi also played an equally important role and exhibited her histrionics in several scenes. Her intelligence and presence of mind were exhibited in several scenes, including the last scene where kills all the thieves during her dance and teases Abu Hussain back in his own style", while concluding that "The film belongs to both MGR and Bhanumathi".
Home media.
"Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum" was released on DVD by Raj Video Vision in April 2012.

Nadodi Mannan (1958 film)

Nadodi Mannan (; ) is a Tamil film starring M. G. Ramachandran. This industrial record was beaten by "Enga Veettu Pillai" seven years later. The film was re-released. It was most recently released in 2005 and in 2011 in a fully digitalised form and ran in Tamil Nadu. Silver Jubilee hit and it ran more than 100 days in Tamil Nadu and Ceylon. It is screened all the time in Tamil Nadu 
Production.
The story is based on Anthony Hope’s 1894 novel The Prisoner of Zenda, Justin Huntly McCarthy’s stage play If I Were King and the English movie Viva Zapata. MGR made his crew consisting of R. M. Veerappan, Vidwan V. Lakshmanan and S. K .T. Sami to watch the three productions. He gave them his suggestions regarding the outline he had in mind and after several brainstorming sessions, the team came up with an imaginative story, tailoring it to make it more Indian.
MGR was keen to act in a double role. Since the advertisement in the papers of the making of "Nadodi Mannan", MGR had faced hurdles. At the same time P. Bhanumathi of Bharani Pictures had announced a movie which would be based on "The Prisoner of Zenda". MGR and Bhanumathi had discussed trying to convince each other to abandon the project. MGR told Bhanumathi that she could proceed if she had been intending to fully adapt "The Prisoner of Zenda" as he was only planning to make a movie which was loosely based on it. P. Bhanumathi gave in and MGR was able to proceed in his project. 
Commenting on the tile "Nadodi Mannan", MGR is said to have confessed that if the movie profited, he would be a King (Mannan); if it flopped, he would be a homeless nomad (Nadodi). The movie was some years in the making. All dedicated members of MGR’s entourage were put to work night and day on the project. K. Ramnoth was appointed to direct this movie, but upon his sudden demise on 4 October 1956, MGR had taken up the direction responsibilities. The latter portions depicting the happenings in the island were shot in colour. 
The completed movie ran for around 5 hours, and the editors had a tough job ahead of them. MGR had discussed with R. M. Veerappan and Vidwan Lakshmanan and decided which scenes that should be eliminated. Arumugam was the initially appointed editor, but when he left after working for a few days, K. Perumal took over the responsibility. He too left midway. Finally it was Jambu who edited the portions shot in colour. Despite eliminating whole sequences, the final version ran more than 3.5 hours. Music Director N. S. Balakrishnan was appointed to compose music and made three songs. Then S. M. Subbaiah Naidu stepped in and completed the remaining songs and composed the background score as well. 
In turn, MGR received help from unexpected parties. B. Nagi Reddy had supported by allowing MGR for grand sets in Vijaya Studios, which was then Asia's biggest film studio. Until then only studio owners could make movies with magnificent sets. Likewise, S. S. Vasan of Gemini Studios had lent his expensive equipment voluntarily so that the miniature shots scenes would come out well. It is believed that it was the only time that any equipment of Gemini Studious was ever permitted to be taken out of the premises. Another person to was Senior Director K. Subramanyam who had been requested by MGR to oversee his work. K. Subramanyam attended one shooting schedule and was so impressed with MGR’s diligent approach that felt that there was no need for anyone to supervise MGR. K. Subramanyam in turn had made all arrangements for many of the outdoor shoots, especially at Munnar and he even flew to Bombay to ensure a fresh supply of color film so that the shooting could continue uninterrupted.
Plot.
Ratnapuri is a small kingdom besieged by manifold troubles. The King’s only daughter Ratna (B. Saroja Devi) is kidnapped and the King dies without naming any successors. Marthandan (MGR), a member of the royal family is chosen by the majority of the imperial council, including the ministers and the commander-in-chief, to be the new ruler. However, the Rajaguru (P. S. Veerappa) has a different idea. Unknown to anyone, he has the princess Ratna in his custody in an island. Ratna has grown up completely unaware of her ancestry. Meanwhile, the Rajaguru plans to do get rid of Marthandan and put up his stooge Pingalan (M. N. Nambiar) as the King. He then plans to marry Ratna himself, get rid of Pingalan, and declare himself the ruler. Meanwhile, Veerabagu (K. R. Ramsingh), the loyal bodyguard of the erstwhile King, and his gang of committed people, including his son Bhoopathi and daughter Madana (P. Bhanumathi) are furious at an outsider ascending the throne. Elsewhere in the kingdom, people are far from happy. Shortage of food and unemployment are rampant all around. 
Violent protests erupt all over the kingdom, and the protesters led by the revolutionary Veerangan (MGR), an activist for a democratic government, march to the palace condemning the monarchy and demanding democracy. Veerangan is arrested and imprisoned. Madana is also incarcerated in the same prison on a similar charge. They are pardoned and released on the occasion of the coronation of Marthandan. They travel together from Naganathapuram to Ratnapuri. Sharing the same ideals and revolutionary thoughts, they find themselves falling in love. 
In the meantime Marthandan arrives at Ratnapuri, but the Rajaguru asks him to stay in an isolated palace in the outskirts and should not meet his consort Queen Manohari (M. N. Rajam) until the coronation, citing the inauspicious placement of the stars. The twist in the tale comes when we come to know that Marthandan and Veerangan are look-alikes. Veerangan is mistaken for Marthandan in a few tight situations and finally they get to meet each other. Veeran (MGR) on the run from monarchists ends up in the room of his lookalike prince Marthandan. Veerangan speaks of the pathetic state of the poor and the oppressed and the noble Marthandan agrees to set right the ills as soon as he takes charge. 
However, on the eve of the coronation, the Rajaguru arranges Marthandan to be poisoned so with help of the royal advisor Karmegam (M. G. Chakrapani) that he could then seat Pingalan on the throne. Marthandan swoons after drinking a few sips of the poisoned beverage. The hastily summoned doctor does the needful and saves Marthandan. However, Marthandan is still unconscious and apparently would remain so for the next few days. An assassination attempt leaves the prince incapacitated, and Veeran has to take his place at the coronation. The commander (E. R. Sahadevan) and minister persuade Veerangan to take Marthandan’s place to ensure that the coronation takes place as scheduled. A reluctant Veerangan agrees to do so in the interests of the state, and arrives in the assembly just in time for the coronation. The Rajaguru is taken aback and sends his men to investigate. The villains find the unconscious Marthandan and take him to their hideout and later to the same island where the Ratna has been living all along. 
With Marthandan’s sudden disappearance, Veerangan now finds himself saddled with the role of the King for much more than just the couple of days that he had initially bargained for. The replacement King starts a series of 'people oriented' reforms which cause a political upheaval among the elite. He puts the opportunity to good use, and enacts several measures for the uplift of the poor. He is however troubled by the fact that he is deceiving the Queen Manohari who believes him to be her husband Marthandan. At one stage he is forced to reveal the truth to Manohari and perceiving his noble character, she accepts him as her brother. In the meantime Madana is killed by Pingalan’s men, and a grief-stricken Veerangan vows to avenge her death. Then it comes to light that the original heir to the throne had been kidnapped and the prince has also been kidnapped to an island. Madana’s father gets to know of Marthandan’s whereabouts and passes on the information to Veerangan. 
The rescuing of the real heir and the prince forms the rest of the story. Veerangan sails to the island and comes across Ratna. He identifies her by her unique birthmark and rescues her from Pingalan’s clutches. They travel to the cave atop a hill where Marthandan is held captive, and Veerangan succeeds in bringing him out. And at the end of the thrilling climax, replete with snakes, sword fights, flooding waters, collapsing rope-bridge and what not, the Rajaguru meets a watery death. All is well that ends well – Veerangan weds Ratna, and Marthandan issues a proclamation pronouncing Ratnapuri to be a democratic nation.

SS Breda

SS "Breda" was a Dutch cargo-passenger ship sunk in Scotland during World War II.
Construction.
The ship was built at the "Nieuwe Waterweg Scheepsbouwmaatschappij" ("New Waterway Shipbuilding Company") yard at Schiedam for the "Koninklijke Nederlandsche Stoomboot Maatschappij" ("Royal Netherlands Steamship Company"). Laid down on 16 December 1919, she was not launched until 2 July 1921, and finally completed on 
10 December 1921. The ship was long, and wide, and was powered by two Metropolitan-Vickers steam turbine engines, giving her a top speed of . She had five cargo holds, and could also accommodate up to 87 passengers.
Ship history.
After the invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940 the "Breda" fled to Britain, where she was placed under the control of the P&O Line, and armed with a single gun.
On 23 December 1940 she was laying off Oban, part of a convoy being assembled that was bound for Bombay. She carried a mixed general cargo that included 3,000 tons of cement, 175 tons of tobacco and cigarettes, three Hawker and 30 de Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes, Army lorries, NAAFI crockery, copper ingots, rubber-soled sandals, banknote paper, 10 horses and nine dogs.
At dusk a group of Heinkel He 111 bombers flying from Stavanger, Norway, swept across the anchorage, and straddled the "Breda" with four bombs. The force of the explosions ruptured a water inlet pipe, and the engine room was rapidly flooded, depriving the ship of power. She was quickly taken under tow, and beached in shallow water in Ardmucknish Bay. The next day, only a small part of her cargo had been offloaded before a storm swept her into deeper water where she sank to a mean depth of at position .
The ship has since become a popular dive site, marked by buoys.

Thaikkupin Tharam

Thaaikkuppin Thaaram () is a Tamil language film starring M. G. Ramachandran in the lead role. The film was released on 4 September 1956. It is most notable for Ramachandran (or "MGR") using an older film as a flashback in the film. The story was a simple rural tale of love and valour.
Production.
The movie was directed by M. A. Thirumugam, the younger brother of Sando M. M. A. Chinnappa Thevar. Thirumugam had already been as an editor while working for Jupiter Pictures, and "Thaaikkuppin Thaaram" was the first movie he directed. Devar took Thirumugam to famous directors like K. Ramnoth and L. V. Prasad and sought their blessings and guidance. The shooting commenced on 5th July 1955 in the sets put up at the Vauhini Studios, with Nagi Reddy cranking the camera for the first shot.
As the story needed an imposing bull, Devar searched far and wide for a fine specimen. His men came back with reports of a landowner in Periakulam having a majestic bull in his farm. Devar approached the landowner, and managed to buy the bull after much persuasion, paying Rs. 1000 for it. 
Plot.
Muthaiyan is the brave son of Ratnam Pillai and Meenakshi. They are landed gentry and are highly respected in the village for their noble qualities. Meenakshi’s brother Doraiswami, on the other hand, is despised by all for his arrogance, cruelty and dishonourable ways. The two families are not in speaking terms ever since Doraiswami tried to usurp Ratnam Pillai’s traditional rights at the temple festival. Doraiswami’s daughter Sivakami, however, is a good-natured girl who is in love with Muthaiyan. Muthaiyan too reciprocates her love and they are determined to surmount all hurdles and get married. When Doraiswami’s men capture Muthaiyan and keep him a prisoner on the pretext that he had hurled stones at Doraiswami’s prized bull when he had caught it grazing on his crops, Sivakami comes to his rescue.
Meanwhile accosting Doraiswami demanding his son’s release, Ratnam Pillai declares bravely that he would overpower the touted bull. But the bull gores him to death. In his dying breath, he elicits a promise from Meenakshi that she would ensure that their son sets right this slur on their honour. Muthaiyan’s mother makes him promise that he would not even think of Sivakami anymore. Sivakami’s father too has isolated her in house arrest and has started looking out for a suitable husband for her.
How Muthaiyan wins the hand of Sivakami after overpowering the mighty bull Senkodan and reforming his wily uncle forms rest of the tale.

Trivia.
The movie was a runaway hit, and proved an auspicious launch vehicle for Devar Films.

Colonel Holloway

Colonel Holloway (foaled in 1909) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 1912 Preakness Stakes.
He was bred by Catesby Woodford of Runnymede Farm in Paris, Kentucky and raced by Frank J. Nolan's Beverwyck Stable. Trained by Dave Woodford, for his Preakness win, Colonel Holloway was ridden by jockey Clarence Turner. Colonel Holloway was not among the original entries for the race, but was added to the field after winning the Maryland Club purse earlier in the day. He started at odds of 8/5 and won from Bwana Tumbo and Tipsand. The race was run as a handicap, with Colonel Holloway carrying 107 pounds, thirteen pounds less than the runner-up. Records show the colt ran second to Sotemia in the four mile Kentucky Endurance Stakes in October of the same year.
As of 1915, Colonel Holloway was still racing in the United States and in Canada. His owner was listed as D.J. Scanlon. No records have been found of any progeny of Colonel Holloway or of his death.

The National Parcs

The National Parcs are a Canadian electronic band from Montreal.
Members.
This band’s members are Vincent Letellier, Chimwemwe Miller, and Ian Cameron. Letellier was originally known as "Freeworm", with whom Miller has been collaborating with as a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist since 2001. Ian Cameron joins the latter two as visual director to jointly form The National Parcs. Their first CD, Timbervision was premiered at the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal in November 2007.
Style.
They boast influences of hip-hop, baile funk, and gospel. And although their primary objective is to get people to dance to their music, lines can also be drawn towards serious music such as musique concrete (which uses taped samples of ambient noise to create a work) and also the work of Murray R. Schafer. Like Schafer they may be considered indigenists and internationalists in that they have drawn from what they found locally to produce a work that is uniquely Canadian, yet would have mass appeal to people all over the world. Unlike Schafer however, The National Parcs had no clear goal in mind when they interned themselves in the northern Quebec wilderness with their audio-video recording equipment, nor did they have any idea as to how much noise pollution from civilization they would encounter,
Their method then, consisted of audio-video sampling the three men’s interactions with nature; throwing sticks or stones together, the splash of a canoe paddle, the motor of an ATV. Cameron then separated the sounds from the video, so that Lettelier and Miller could manipulate them. They chose to leave them as raw as possible so that they would take on a percussive quality, then, a beat was added, and then the lyrics.
The visual element was always present to remind them of where the sounds came from, and the videos of the songs, inspired by early National Film Board nature documentaries, more than music videos are “art videos.” While the visual element is at the genesis of their sound, and the band features special visual spectacles in their live performances, their songs make sense and are perfectly listenable when played on their own without the visuals.
Critical acclaim.
Since their debut at the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal in November 2007, they were received with much acclaim from the artistic community. Their debut was so successful that the Musée d’art contemporain chose to feature their material during a Triennale video-music series over the summer. On March 1, 2008, The National Parcs were awarded a MIMI-GAMIQ prize for the artist that would benefit most of support in Quebec and Canada. Since then they have been touring across Canada at various folk and blues festivals. In September 2008, they plan to have a residency in Normandy, France at a film festival.
Due to the nature-friendly content of their work, various unnamed environmental groups have heralded the Parcs. Although the appreciation for the environment is certainly there, the band members have insisted that they do not want to have the role of activists. They warn that in the future their material may feature less wilderness content, while still drawing upon the Canadian experience to create dance music with an international appeal.

Hyomandibula

The hyomandibula, commonly referred to as hyomandibular (, from , "upsilon-shaped" (υ), and Latin: mandibula, "jawbone") is a set of bones that is found in the hyoid region in most fishes. It usually plays a role in suspending the jaws and/or operculum (teleostomi only). It is commonly suggested that in tetrapods (land animals), the hyomandibula evolved into the columella (stapes).
Evolutionary context.
In jawless fishes a series of gills opened behind the mouth, and these gills became supported by cartilaginous elements. The first set of these elements surrounded the mouth to form the jaw. There are ample evidences that vertebrate jaws are homologous to the gill arches of jawless fishes. The upper portion of the second embryonic arch supporting the gill became the hyomandibular bone of jawed fishes, which supports the skull and therefore links the jaw to the cranium.
When vertebrates found their way onto land, the hyomandibula, with its location near the ear, began to function as a sound amplifier beside its function to support the skull. As evolution later attached the cranium of terrestrial vertebrates to the rest of the skull, the hyomandibula lost its supportive function and became an interior organ, the stapes, and thus its secondary function had become its primary function.

Dawn is an unincorporated community in eastern Deaf Smith County, Texas, United States. It lies along FM 809 northeast of the city of Hereford, the county seat of Deaf Smith County. Its elevation is 3,802 feet (1,159 m). Although Dawn is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 79025; the ZCTA for ZIP Code 79025 had a population of 138 at the 2000 census.
Dawn was founded by local rancher Jim Moore in 1887; it was named by a shopkeeper who bought the land two years later, but the reason for calling it "Dawn" is disputed. The community flourished in the 1890s, when it received its first schools and railroad line. The community's schools were consolidated with the Hereford district in 1963.
The Bluegrass musicians Smokey Mayfield (1924-2008) and Thomas Edd Mayfield (1926-1958) were born in Dawn. A third Mayfield brother, Herbert Mayfield (1920-2008), lived in Dawn as a young boy until his family moved to Dimmitt, the seat of Castro County in 1931.

Wu Chuanyu

Wu Chuanyu () (August 21, 1928 - October 29, 1954) was a Chinese swimmer who competed in the Olympic Games in 1948 and 1952. In his second Games, he became the first competitor for the People's Republic of China in Olympic history.
He was born in Salatiga, Central Java, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) on August 21, 1928, the son of immigrants from Fujian, a coastal province of southeastern China. He swam from an early age, playing as a child on the riverside of Surakarta. In 1941, at the age of 13, he performed beyond all expectations at an important swimming competition in Indonesia, setting a new Indonesian record for the 200 metre butterfly and beating the Dutch champion.
Wu was one of the 26 competitors—and the lone swimmer—representing the Republic of China at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Wu swam in the heats of the men's 100 metre freestyle, finishing fifth in his heat with the 32nd fastest time overall (1:03.5).
In the fall of 1951, at the age of 23, Wu represented Indonesia at the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students in East Berlin, winning a silver medal in the 100 metre backstroke, with a time of 1:12.8.
At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Wu was part of the 40-member delegation from the People's Republic of China. The government decided to send the Olympic team only one day prior to the opening ceremonies, and the basketball and football teams arrived too late to compete, making Wu the only competitor for China at those Games.
Wu swam in the heats of the men's 100 metre backstroke on July 30, and finished fifth in his heat with the 28th fastest time overall (1:12.3).
In August 1953, Wu competed at the 4th World Festival of Youth and Students in Bucharest, Romania. He won the 100 metre backstroke with a time of 1:06.4. His victory was so unexpected that the swimming organizers did not have a recording of the Chinese national anthem and had to borrow one from the athletics organizers. This medal ceremony was the first time that the flag of the People's Republic of China was raised at an international sporting event.
In 1954, Wu and the entire Chinese swimming team was sent to Budapest, Hungary to receive training. While in Budapest, Wu attended the 12th World Student Games.

The Southern Theater

The Southern Theater is located in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Built in 1910 as a cultural center and legitimate theater for the burgeoning Scandinavian community centered around Cedar Avenue ("Snoose Boulevard"), the Southern has been re-established as a center for contemporary performing arts over the past quarter-century. The Southern Theater is the home of Balls Cabaret, a weekly midnight cabaret entering its twenty-second year.
Building history.
The 1910-era Southern featured vaudeville shows, Saturday silent movies for the kids, and original-language Scandinavian plays by the likes of August Strindberg and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. (It also featured "a set of electric chimes, twenty-seven bells scattered through the house and played by electricity… this is an entirely new feature in the Northwest.") It maintained close ties with Stockholm’s Södra Teatern (Southern Theater); an exchange program allowed actors from one Southern to perform at the other when visiting Minneapolis or Stockholm.
During the 1920s the Southern offered silent films with occasional evenings of live drama, vaudeville, and amateur variety shows. In the 1930s, with the arrival of talking pictures, it became a neighborhood movie theater; in the 1940s it became an adults-only movie house which ultimately went out of business.
In the late 1940s it was taken over by a contractor who used the building as a garage for heavy road equipment, leveling the floor and opening up large garage doors through the walls to accommodate his needs. (Sometime during this period the original façade was demolished as well.) It then became a warehouse and a gift shop, and in 1959 the Gaslight Restaurant opened. The Gaslight is still remembered by some as a coveted fancy dining destination (and by others as the site of marvelous pyrotechnics courtesy of the inebriated gentleman whose job it was to light the outside gaslight). The restaurant, which includes a marble bar and ticket counter, closed in the mid 1960s and the building stood vacant for about ten years.
In 1975 the Guthrie Theater leased the space and refurbished it as a performance space. The Guthrie 2 had two primary components: a resident (Equity) acting company which performed "mainstage" shows at 8 PM (one of whose members was John Peilmeier, who later went on to write "Agnes of God"), and a "Community Space Program" which enabled local performers in all disciplines to use the space for late-night productions. Such notable Twin Cities performing groups as Theatre de la Jeune Lune, Illusion Theater, and Zenon Dance Company (then "Ozone") had some of their first performances as part of this program.
The Equity Company aspect of the Guthrie 2 was disbanded after just a few months, but the Community Space Program lived on for several more years until the Guthrie terminated the lease on the building and closed its doors in 1979. A concerted community effort resulted in ownership being transferred to an independent non-profit corporation, the Southern Theater Foundation, and the space was again re-opened under its original "Southern Theater" name. The Southern has now been in continuous operation since 1981 as a home for the Twin Cities’ finest independent performing artists.

Preston Ware Orem

Preston Ware Orem (1865 – May 26, 1938) was an American composer, pianist, and writer on music. He is frequently grouped with other composers as part of the Indianist movement in American music.
Born in Philadelphia, Orem received his secondary education at the Eastburn Academy, and did his undergraduate work at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received his degree in music. He studied organ and music theory with Hugh Archibald Clarke, and was instructed in piano by Charles H. Jarvis. From 1889 until 1895 he served as the organist of St. Paul's Procathedral in Los Angeles; after this he returned home, teaching for one year at the Philadelphia Conservatory. From 1896 until 1905 he taught at the Combs Conservatory of Music. In 1900 Orem began a long association with Theodore Presser, serving as a music critic and editor for the publisher while conducting the Presser Choral Society. From 1901 until 1910 he again worked as an organist, this time at the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church. Orem also wrote theory books, including 1919's "Harmony Book for Beginners", and compiled nine books of musical exercises. It is for these that he is chiefly remembered.
As a composer, Orem was less interested than many of his contemporaries in the Indianist movement; still, as it was in fashion, it seems to have held a certain fascination for him. He is numbered among its members mainly because of his "American Indian Rhapsody", his most popular work. Originally written for piano, but later scored for full orchestra, it contains reference to the music of the Cheyenne, Kiowa, Sioux, Chippewa, Pueblo, and Cree tribes, and is based on themes recorded and suggested by Thurlow Lieurance. The "Rhapsody" has been described as very much a period piece, stylistically conventional and eclectic, post-Romantic and neo-Lisztian in its mannerisms and pretentiousness, its plethora of trills, arpeggios, broken chords, and repeated octaves (often thunderous), and its bravura display of virtuosity, with indications ranging from "molto maestoso" to "allegretto scherzando", from "andante affetuoso" to "allegro con brio", from "amabile" to "feroce" (the savage!). It is probably the most far-out Indianist composition ever written. 
Orem composed other works as well, including a piano quartet, a quintet, large numbers of songs, some works for piano, and numerous transcriptions and arrangements; among the latter is a movement from one of Johann Sebastian Bach's solo cello suites, arranged for organ. Orem died in Philadelphia in 1938.
A handful of Orem's piano works have been recorded by Naxos Records for release on the Marco Polo label, as part of a series documenting the work of Indianist composers. In addition, the piano version of the "American Indian Rhapsody" may be found on a New World Records release of American romantic piano music.

Wildorado, Texas

Wildorado is an unincorporated community in Oldham County, Texas, United States. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 180 in 2000.
Geography.
Wildorado is located along FM 809 south of and Main Street north of Interstate 40, east of Vega, the county seat of Oldham County. The nearest large city is Amarillo, located approximately 20 miles east of Wildorado.
Wildorado's elevation is 3,921 feet (1,195 m).
History.
Named for nearby Wildorado Creek, the community was founded in 1900 as a railway town along the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railroad. It was first settled by Eugene Binford and John R. Goodman, who ranched in the area before 1900. A post office was established in 1904. In 1908, the railroad was completed and a town site was laid out. Goodman organized the Wildorado State Bank and built the Wildorado Hotel. A newspaper, the "Wildorado Progress", began publication in 1909. By 1915, Wildorado had an estimated population of 100. During the 1920s and 1930s, the community endured droughts and dust storms. In 1936, Wildorado had a population of 57 with seven businesses. That figure increased to around 125 residents in the late 1940s. The gradual evolution of the Ozark Trail (Route 66) into Interstate 40 encouraged growth. After World War II, when travel became a popular past time, Wildorado responded with services along its portion of Route 66 and the population rose to over 200 by the late 1950s. The formation of the Wildorado Water Supply Corporation in 1976-77 ensured a rural water supply and irrigation wells. During the latter half of the twentieth century, the population hovered around 180. Although Wildorado is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 79098.
Education.
Public education is provided by the Wildorado Independent School District. Troy Duck is the district's superintendent. The district has a single campus, Wildorado Elementary School, that serves students in grades prekindergarten through six. Wildorado ISD is rated an Exemplary District by the Texas Education Agency. Wildorado Elementary accepts transfers and provides transportation by bus for accepted students. Students in grades 7-12 attend one of the nearby neighboring districts.

Crystal Lee Sutton

Crystal Lee Sutton (née Pulley; December 31, 1940 – September 11, 2009), formerly known as Crystal Lee Jordan, was an American union organizer and advocate who gained fame during the early 1970s. She was fired from her job at the J.P. Stevens plant in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, for trying to unionize its employees. 
Early life and career.
Sutton was earning $2.65 an hour folding towels. The poor working conditions she and her fellow employees suffered compelled her to join forces with Eli Zivkovich, a union organizer, and attempt to unionize the J.P. Stevens employees. “Management and others treated me as if I had leprosy,” she stated. 
She received threats and was finally fired from her job. But before she left, she took one final stand, filmed verbatim in the 1979 film "Norma Rae". “I took a piece of cardboard and wrote the word UNION on it in big letters, got up on my work table, and slowly turned it around. The workers started cutting their machines off and giving me the victory sign. All of a sudden the plant was very quiet…” Sutton was physically removed from the plant by police, but the result of her actions was staggering. The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union won the right to represent the workers at the plant on August 28, 1974. Sutton later became a paid organizer for the ACTWU. Sutton was the 13th recipient of the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award in 1980. The honor was named after a 1963 encyclical letter, "Pacem in Terris" (Peace on Earth), by Pope John XXIII, that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations.
Norma Rae.
The 1979 film "Norma Rae", starring Sally Field, is based on Sutton's early union work. The movie is based on the 1975 book about her by "New York Times" reporter Henry "Hank" Leiferman "Crystal Lee: A Woman of Inheritance". Her papers and memorabilia are located at Alamance Community College in North Carolina, where she took classes in nursing in 1988.
Personal life.
Crystal Lee Pulley was born in Roanoke Rapids. She married at 19, gave birth to her first child at 20, and was widowed at 21. She had a second child out of wedlock at 22. She married Larry Jordan Jr. and had her third child at 25. Following the events that made her famous, and prior to the release of "Norma Rae", she and Jordan were divorced. She married Lewis Sutton Jr. about 1977 (obituaries stated they were married 32 years).
Death.
Crystal Lee Sutton died, aged 68, at Hospice House in Burlington, North Carolina, on September 11, 2009, from meningioma, a form of brain cancer that she had been fighting for several years. She had been struggling with her health insurance company, which had delayed her treatment.

<doc id="18849825" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18849825" title="Jacobsen v. Katzer">
Jacobsen v. Katzer

Jacobsen v. Katzer was a lawsuit between Robert Jacobsen (plaintiff) and Matthew Katzer (defendant), filed March 13, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The case addressed claims concerning copyright, patent invalidity, cybersquatting, and Digital Millennium Copyright Act issues relating to model train control software, developed by Jacobsen under an open source license.
The District Court first found in a summary judgement that the open source copyright did not support damages for copyright violation. This was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that such copyrights were enforceable. The case was settled out of court on February 16, 2010. This was a contentious case, with litigation encompassing 405 Federal District Court document filings and two appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
The case is of general interest because it has clarified the enforceability of licensing for all parties (open-source software and proprietary software) under United States copyright law. It established that the conditions of the Artistic License are "enforceable copyright conditions".
Background.
Jacobsen, a model railroad hobbyist and a programmer, started the Java Model Railroad Interface (JMRI) Project along with other software developers in 2000, on the open-source incubation web-site Sourceforge.net. The goal of the project was to create interfaces that would allow model trains to be controlled on a layout of model train tracks. The software created by JMRI community was distributed without charge on the Internet, subject to the terms of the Artistic License. JMRI also sells custom software directly to modelers and to dealers for resale. JMRI's sales have qualified JMRI for membership as a business in the Model Railroad Industry Association (MRIA).
Katzer is the owner of KAMIND Associates Inc., an Oregon company doing business under the name KAM Industries. KAM produced and sold beginning in 1997 a commercial product for model trains, Train Tools, based on client-server software.
Katzer owns several patents that may apply to the model railroad industry, one of which he alleged the JMRI project may infringe. Jacobsen, however, alleged that Katzer's software utilizes textual files from the JMRI project, in violation of copyright and the DMCA. Katzer subsequently countersued Jacobsen for $6 million for copyright infringement.
In addition to the patent claims, there was also a dispute over web sites. In February 2004, Katzer registered the web domain decoderpro.com; however, DecoderPro is the trademarked name for a JMRI program. Jacobsen succeeded in obtaining the return of the domain name.
Litigation history.
Initial actions.
Both Jacobsen and Katzer moved for summary judgment and the district court ruled on their motions in December 2009.
Summary judgment.
The summary judgment deals with a series of submissions presented by Jacobsen (plaintiff) and Katzer (defendant). Responses to initial submissions were filed on November 13.
Both plaintiff and defendant further replied to responses on November 19 and 20. Prior to oral arguments on December 4, Judge Jeffrey S. White issued a Notice of Tentative Ruling and Questions, tentatively affirming in part and denying in part Jacobsen's motion for summary judgment and tentatively denying Katzer's motion for summary judgment.
On December 10, 2009, the judge denied Katzer's motion, concluding that Jacobsen could copyright the selection and ordering of the decoder definition files and could show monetary damages for copyright infringement. In the same ruling, he granted in part and denied in part Jacobsen's motion, finding that Katzer did register the decoderpro.com domain name in bad faith, that Katzer is liable for copyright infringement of the decoder definition files and that Katzer's counterclaim for copyright infringement is barred by the doctrine of laches (damaged argument), and ruled that Jacobsen had a license under an "Implied License" doctrine. The judge did not rule on damages for copyright infringement and determined that the questions of Katzer's knowledge or intent in removing copyright notices are triable issues.
Settlement.
The parties reached settlement on February 16, 2010, and the settlement fee fully paid on March 5, 2010.
The basic elements of the Settlement Agreement include:
Specific issues.
Copyright claims.
KAM received a copyright infringement notification from Jacobsen on September 11, 2006, and on the same day Jacobsen filed an amended complaint that included a claim for copyright infringement. On the same day KAM removed allegedly infringing materials from KAM's website. In Jacobsen's declaration, in support of a motion for a preliminary injunction, he specifically identified examples of alleged copyright infringement.
In August 2007, the district court denied Jacobsen's request for declaratory judgment, holding that the "defendants' alleged violation of the conditions of the license may have constituted a breach of the nonexclusive license, but does not create liability for copyright infringement." The judge stated that JMRI failed to allege claims that were the proximate cause of a breach of the Artistic License.
In August 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the district court's ruling, holding that the terms of the Artistic License are enforceable copyright conditions, and sent the case back to the district court. The appeals court said, "Open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace that few could have imagined just a few decades ago," and cited as examples "the GNU/Linux operating system, the Perl programming language, the Apache web server programs, the Firefox web browser, and a collaborative web-based encyclopedia called Wikipedia." Professor Lawrence Lessig called the ruling "a very important victory" that applies to all open source licenses, and many other news organizations commented on the finding.
In January 2009, the District Court again ruled on the preliminary motions, saying that it would hear Jacobsen's copyright claims but denying Jacobsen a preliminary injunction due to a lack of evidence showing any specific and actual harm.
In June 2009, the Software Freedom Law Center filed an amicus brief before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) calling for injunctive relief for open source developers. In the brief, SFLC argues that a Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) developer whose license has been violated should be able to call upon the courts to prevent further infringing distributions. The brief outlines harms to developers, development communities, and project productivity related to open source license violations.
Jacobsen based his case on an assertion of a copyright on behalf of a free software project that is otherwise extremely generous in granting permissions for downstream copying, modifying, and distributing its works. Jacobsen explains that the basis of his copyright claims is that 102 files defining 291 decoders of the 500 decoders available on the market are at issue in this claim. JMRI developers chose the decoders they found most interesting and useful, and then structured the resulting definition files in a unique way, not based upon manufacturer or NMRA approaches, but reflecting the judgment of the JMRI developers as to their preferred arrangement, particularly choosing an arrangement appropriate for integrating these files with the rest of the JMRI software.
Patent claims.
Katzer asserted that after he shipped model train software that used a client/server protocol in July 1997, he filed a patent application within the United States one year statutory period, namely in June 1998, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, consisting of 53 method claims for client/server control of model trains by computer software.
On April 14, 2002, the JMRI project published a new capability in their code, over 4 years after KAM presented their client/server architecture, which allowed a computer to control the layout of a model railroad via a client/server protocol. On April 17, 2002, Katzer filed a continuation patent application, with a priority date back to 1998, with the patent office claiming those exact capabilities. On March 11, 2003 the patent office granted the patent (the "'329 patent") claiming those exact capabilities. DigiToys Systems also noted WinLok released in 1998 which is not prior art. This information was provided to the file history of the '329 patent, by the two model railroad hobbyists, which is the parent of the pending continuation patent. Manual Patent Examining Procedures 707.05 states "In all continuation and continuation-in-part applications, the parent applications should be reviewed for pertinent prior art." Accordingly, the references cited by the two model railroad hobbyists were before the patent office in the '329 patent.
On March 8, 2005, Katzer sent patent infringement letters and bills to Jacobsen, claiming that the code in the JMRI project infringed his patent, and that more than $200,000 was due for licensing fees of previously distributed versions of the project. Jacobsen filed for a declaratory judgment against Katzer. In it, Jacobsen alleged that the June 1998 patent is invalid due to prior art, that Katzer deliberately failed to provide the patent office with the prior art, and that Katzer's patents had been granted by the patent office in error.
On February 1, 2009, Katzer filed two disclaimers with the U.S. Patent Office, effectively making two of his patents unenforceable in their entirety. The result of the disclaimer was to remove all patent issues from the case.
KAM stated that the disclaimer of the '329 patent was purely based upon economic considerations to avoid the cost of patent litigation
Cybersquatting claims.
In July, 2001, JMRI began calling one of its subprojects "DecoderPro.". In February, 2004, Katzer purchased the domain decoderpro.com. After this was mentioned on a (non-JMRI) model railroad software mailing list., Jerry Britton (a JMRI user/member) purchased and began using the domain name computerdispatcherpro.com, in apparent violation of Katzer's trademark on Computer Dispatcher. He also threatened to point KAM's computerdispatcherpro.com to a "good porn site". Katzer sued Britton to force him to stop infringing on the computerdispatcherpro.com trademark, and prevent Britton from pointing the domain name to such a site, and Jacobsen asked Katzer to transfer the decoderpro.com domain to him.
A settlement agreement between Britton and Katzer resulted in Britton transferring computerdispatcherpro.com to Katzer, and Katzer in turn transferring decoderpro.com to Britton. The agreement allowed Britton to point the domain to the JMRI decoderpro project site, but also prohibited Britton from transferring the domain name without Katzer's permission.
Jacobsen included a demand for return of decoderpro.com in his lawsuit against Katzer. He also filed an action with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) against fellow JMRI user Jerry Britton, asking that they settle the matter per the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDNDP); Britton did not respond to the action. On July 26, 2007, WIPO found in favor of Jacobsen, ruling that Katzer's actions were found to be in "bad faith", since "there was essentially a purpose on the part of Katzer to disrupt the business of a competitor by interfering with Complainant's exercise of his trademark rights.". In the December 2009 Summary Judgement decision, the Federal Court concurred that Katzer had illegally cybersquatted on the decoderpro.com domain name.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act claims.
In his second amended complaint against Katzer, Jacobsen included a section alleging that Katzer violated section 102 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by removing or altered copyright management information.
In response, Katzer filed a motion to dismiss the DMCA claims, stating that "information does not encrypt or control access ... but ... 'functions to inform people who make copyright decisions" did not fall under the DMCA. However, in December 2009, the court ruled that Katzer's removal of the JMRI copyright information was a removal of copyright management information under the DMCA, leaving the question of intent under the DMCA, and damages under the DMCA to be proved at trial.

Ponce de Leon Court Historic District

The Ponce de Leon Court Historic District consists of a single cul-de-sac located immediately east of downtown Decatur, Georgia. The street is accessed off of East Ponce de Leon Avenue, a historic road that runs east from Atlanta, Georgia through Decatur. Historic Decatur Cemetery is located to the north, and affluent Glynnwood Estates, developed in 1927, and Glenwood school border Ponce de Leon Court on the east.
Ponce de Leon Court is a local historic district in the city of Decatur, and was listed in the Georgia Register of Historic Places in June 2010. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on November 2, 2011. The single-street district includes approximately 26 parcels, and was based on a subdivision plat developed by John L. Womack in the 1920s. Womack reportedly wanted homes on this street to remind him of the tropics, so he planted both palm trees and banana trees. The palm trees flourished, but the banana trees died. In the twenty-first century, residents successfully reintroduced banana trees on the north end of the street thanks to a change in the microclimate. The Womack family still owned property on the court when it was designated a historic district.
The closely spaced homes on the narrow street are within walking distance of downtown Decatur, and were constructed in an era when developments did not plan adequately for the automobile. The sense of scale and detail created a strong sense of community, and resulted in this street being recognized as a unique asset in Decatur. Ponce de Leon Court primarily includes 1920s-era American Craftsman bungalows, but also has a few historic multi-family homes. Both the single- and multi-family structures, as well as historic palm trees, have remained largely intact from the era when they were built. 
The street consists entirely of homes. There are no churches, businesses, or apartment blocks.

<doc id="18849998" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18849998" title="SGI 1600SW">
SGI 1600SW

The 1600SW is a widescreen flat panel video monitor from Silicon Graphics introduced in 1998. It won many awards after release and sold 54,000 units. It is notable for longevity, with used models still actively traded on eBay a decade later, despite the difficulty of adapting the monitor to run with modern video cards, due to the 1600SW's OpenLDI video interface.
Formac sold the same monitor bundled with its own OpenLDI graphics adapter as Formac ProNitron 18/500. Radius sold the monitor as the Article which differed mainly in having a translucent white case and a conventional mount. SGI sold the monitor primarily under Model #AM173Y01.
The 1600SW was revolutionary for its time, featuring a 17.3 inch diagonal wide screen panel in a market then dominated by CRT monitors. The 1600SW had a 16:10 aspect ratio (referred to by SGI as SuperWide) with a resolution of 1600 x 1024 pixels. The refresh rate was 60 Hz in 24-bit color and 110 dpi (which makes for a smaller dot pitch than most competitive monitors). The 1600SW shared the same styling motif as the SGI Visual Workstation 320, 540 and O2, with a unique (and troublesome) off-center mount. The display won a dozen international awards and despite its age, it still compares well to modern displays produced a decade later. At introduction the 1600SW cost in the neighborhood of $2500. 
Monitor switches for OpenLDI.
There is a 4-way monitor switch by Dr. Bott called MoniSwitch Pro LDI that allows sharing OpenLDI display among 4 computers, each of which must be equipped with an OpenLDI graphics adapter.
Adapting the 1600SW to Modern Video Cards.
OpenLDI is rarely used today, as all popular home and office LCD panel monitors use a DVI or VGA standard connector. There are several companies that make adapter boxes which allow continued use of these older displays. All of these adapters were developed for the 1600SW monitor:
SGI referred to video cards that support the 1600SW's 1600 x 1024 resolution as Super Wide Savvy. Most modern cards have no trouble with this resolution, but on PC based machines, problems and screen distortion can exist during system boot. Apple Macintoshes boot directly into the proper resolution. Thus, with a little work, the 1600SW can be adapted to almost any modern computer.
Repair.
According to the original SGI project manager Dan Evanicky, the most common failure items are backlights and power supplies. At this point Dan expects that any power supply in continuous use will have failed, though the monitor itself is likely fine. Monitors left on continuous for a decade or more likely have faded backlights.
Generic power supplies work on the unit, specifications are: 3 amps at 12 volts with a 5.5m x 2.5mm center positive coaxial barrel (preferably right angle).
In 2005 Mr. Evanicky purchased the entire spares inventory sitting at Mitsubishi Japan, in order to supply enthusiasts with repair parts.

Fillmore Slim

Clarence Sims (born October 5th, 1934), best known by his stage name, Fillmore Slim, is a blues vocalist and guitarist with five albums to his credit. During the 1960s and 1970s, he was also a highly renowned pimp in San Francisco, often referred to as "The West Coast Godfather of the Game" and "The Pope of Pimping".
Early life.
Born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, Fillmore began learning about the blues at an early age. ""I done lived the blues,"" he once said in an interview. ""The blues is about picking cotton, working in the fields, living in the streets, and you know I did all these things.""
In 1955, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career, playing by himself in the street and later starting a band called Eddy N & the Blues Slayers. During this time he had a relationship with Etta James before she achieved her fame as a blues singer and recorded a few 45 rpm records himself. His most successful record from this time was titled "You Got the Nerve of a Brass Monkey".
Pimping.
Fillmore's life took a dramatic turn when one night, while playing a blues bar in Midland, Texas, he noticed a young woman who kept coming in and out of the bar. As he tells it, ""Finally, she came up to me and said, "I like you. I want you to have this money." I asked her how she got all that money. She finally told me she was a hooker. I asked her what a hooker did, and she broke it on down for me.""
Upon returning to California, he relocated to San Francisco, bringing the girl along with him for extra income. He continued working as a musician, playing in Fillmore District clubs like the Trees Pool Hall and the old Fillmore Theater. He even scored gigs opening for B.B. King and Dinah Washington.
Eventually, however, Fillmore found the lure of pimping too strong and effectively left music behind. He built up a stable of prostitutes and had anywhere from ten to fifteen women working Fillmore Street every day. His wardrobe consisted of sharkskin suits, alligator shoes and diamond watches, and he could often be seen cruising up and down Fillmore Street in a new Cadillac. In the documentary "American Pimp", Fillmore estimates that, in his entire career as a pimp, he had over 9,000 prostitutes. Fillmore is the great-uncle of the renowned New Orleans ex-pimp, turned author, Caleb Benn AKA Caleb Devine, author of Bona Fide Hustler: Based on a true story (Amazon.com) that resides in Texas.
Return to music.
Fillmore Slim became friends with Eli's owner Troyce Key, who admired Slim's musical stylings and eventually recorded his first album called "Born to Sing the Blues" (as Clarence "Guitar" Sims), released in 1987. It was then that, in order to support the album, Fillmore put together a touring band and retired from pimping completely.
In 1996 Mountain Top Records and Fillmore Slim re-released, "Born to Sing the Blues," on the Mountain Top label. Several years of touring and playing gigs followed, which led to a record deal in 1999 with Fedora Records and an album called "Other Side of the Road", released in 2000. Fillmore has released more CDs in the years since with a trilogy of CD's on Mountain Top Records: "The Game"', "The Legend of Fillmore Slim" and "The Blue's Playa's Ball"; that tell his story in his own words and music. Fillmore Slim's song writing talents, and musicianship have garnered several awards including being inducted into the West Coast Blues Hall of Fame in 2008, and the Lowell Fulson "Jus' Blues" Award in Memphis in 2011. Since his musical resurgence, Fillmore has found his largest fanbase to be in Europe, where he's played the Zurich Blues Festival and the Blues Estafette in Utrecht, Holland, and France, among others.
Fillmore Slim's life and times are currently in production for a film, "The Legend of Fillmore Slim".

<doc id="18850007" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18850007" title="Hofamterspiel">
Hofamterspiel

Hofämterspiel (Court-office Game), one of the earliest card games on record preserved in its entirety with all forty-eight cards intact, is a major 15th-century medieval handmade deck commissioned by Ladislaus the Posthumous, king of Hungary and Bohemia and Duke of Austria from 1453 to 1457. It was found among the great collection of art treasures of Archduke Ferdinand of Tirol in castle Ambras, Austria, together with another called Ambraser Hofjagdspiel.
Illustrations.
The 48 cards of the deck, measuring c. 97 mm x 140 mm (3¾ in x 5½ in), are decorated with bright-colored tempera paint and bear details in silver and gold leaf. The four suits of this set depicting court functions are represented by means of four heraldic colours. Each suit sign carries the coats of arms of four kingdoms: France, Germany, Bohemia and Hungary, so that, accordingly, each card carries the title of the function depicted and the respective Roman number in relation to the suit sign it represents. 
The illustrations, with their names written in archaic German, depict the precedence of different court functions during the late Middle Ages, together with the values of the cards, numbered 1 - 10 in Roman numerals, except for the king and queen which have no number and are also the only two subjects that do not state the character's occupation.
In all four suits the I features a fool, "Narr", or its female equivalent Narryn, and the two highest cards next to the king and queen are the master of the household, Hofmeister X, who was in charge of the court during the ruler's absence, and the marshal, Marschalk IX, in charge of any duty that involved the use of horses or carriages. With the exception of two subjects, the Jungfrawe, card VI in all suits, and the Trometer, card IIII in Germany and Hungary, all other personages are individual and don’t appear in any other suit.
The social rank of each one of the personages may be easily understood, according to the higher or lower value of the relevant card. For instance, the Doctor, "Artzt", in Bohemia suit, would have shared more or less the same social rank as a Chaplain, "Capplan", in Germany suit, or of a Chancellor, "Kanzler", in Hungary suit, or of a Household Mistress of a queen or a princess, "Hofmeistryn", in France suit, so all these subjects are featured on the eighth, VIII, card of different suits.
Meaning.
The Hofämterspiel takes its name from the positions held by most of the characters which the cards depict, positions which appear to have been standard feature of a princely court during the Middle Ages. The standard names by which the court positions are known to us today tell us simply what their bearers' duties originally were on a country estate. The word "marshal", for instance, is derived from the original designation for the servant in charge of horses, whose duties involved him in any activities where horses played the major role - in the course of journeys and campaigns, whenever quarters had to be found for the king and his entourage. With the growing importance of cavalry in times of war, the marshal's military duties were extended and in the field he became the fieldmarshal. 
But despite that, unlike other known decks of the same age belonging to German culture, such as the Hofjagdspiel ("court hunting deck") and the Stuttgarter Spiel ("Stuttgart deck"), the important is that the Hofämterspiel reflects the political relationships in Central Europe in the mid-15th century and was basically inspired by the standard social structure of royal courts during the late Middle Ages. Therefore, what makes these cards so interesting is the fact that not only their intrinsic value for the early history of playing cards are shown, but also the evidence they provide for the understanding of the social hierarchy and everyday's life in late medieval courts.
Hunting game.
Which game or games the Hofämterspiel was devised for is virtually impossible to tell, as no other source mentions the deck or its use, except the catalogue entry that describes Ferdinand of Tirol's belongings. The very fine quality of the cards, as well as the particular ranking scheme, suggest that the Hofämterspiel was likely used for playing a trick-taking game, in which the Narr and Narryn might have acted as jokers.
Esoteric symbols.
In some respects the Hofämterspiel reminds us of the so-called Mantegna Tarocchi, a set of 50 copper engraved cards from Italy, c.1465, which also represents a world order, or hierarchy, but in the Hofämsterspiel, considered one of the oldest Taroky packs, contains a card called Küchenmeister, which might be the prototype of Franz Kafka's Oberköchin, or Head Cook in America. Though a Küchenmeister is a master chef and not a head cook, their possible connection should not be disregarded.

Velocity prediction program

A velocity prediction program (VPP) is a program which solves for the performance of a sailing yacht in various wind conditions by balancing hull and sail forces. VPPs are used by yacht designers, boat builders, model testers, sailors, sailmakers, also America's Cup teams, to predict the performance of a sailboat before it has been built or prior to major modifications.
Background.
The first VPP was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the early 1970s when Commodore H. Irving Pratt funded research to predict the performance ""of a sailing yacht, given knowledge of its hull, rig and sailplan geometry"".
Methodology.
VPPs are iterative programs which require educated guesses of initial parameters to begin operating. Generally VPPs are composed of two mechanisms, a "boat model" and a "solution algorithm". 
Initial guesses of parameters including boat speed (Vs), heel angle (Φ), number of reefs and sail flatness are input into the "boat model". Using these input parameters the "solution algorithm" calculates the different between the propulsive force of the sails and the resistive force of the hull. It also calculates the righting moment created by the hull and the operational heel angle. 
Since the propulsive force and the resistive force are not likely to be equal on the first iteration, the "solution algorithm" has the responsibility of adjusting the input parameters and balancing the forces until it produces the maximum possible speed at each true wind angle.
Hydrodynamic force model.
The resistive forces acting on a hull and its appendages (keel, rudder and other fins) can be broken down into a number of smaller components.
Solving and optimization.
VPPs solve for the performance of a yacht by resolving all forces and moments acting on the yacht. Pitching and yawing moments can be assumed to be zero for simplicity.
Presentation.
VPPs produce a great deal a data, so the presentation of this data requires special consideration. While tabular output can be valuable for identifying specific values, the most common way to present VPP output is with a polar plot.
Uses.
Sailing Yacht Handicapping.
VPPs are used by a variety of sailing organizations to assess theoretical boat performance and then assign "handicaps" to allow boats of different styles and sizes to race against one another. The IOR and IMS handicapping rules were some of the earliest adopters of VPPs. In the United States, the most common handicapping rule is the PHRF rule, developed and promoted by the United States Sailing Association. While most other rules do not take past performance into account, PHRF differentiates itself by allowing skippers to request handicap reductions after a series of poor racing results. In Europe, the most common handicapping system used today is the IRC rule.

1920 (film)

1920 is a 2008 Indian horror film written and directed by Vikram Bhatt. Filmed in Hindi, the film revolves around the events surrounding a married couple living in a haunted house in the year 1920. The film stars debutant actors Rajniesh Duggall and Adah Sharma as the married couple. The film was a critical and commercial success. The film was also dubbed into Telugu as "1920 Gayathri". A sequel "" was also released to mixed reviews and commercial success in 2013.
Plot.
The film opens in the year 1920 at Palampur, India. An architect arrives at a large "haveli" (manor house). The manager of the "haveli", MK, discusses how the owner of the "haveli" wishes to have it torn down and have a hotel constructed in its place. Later that night, the architect hears strange sounds, and when he goes out to investigate, he is killed by a mysterious force. It turns out the architect who was engaged before him was killed in a similar manner some time ago.
The film introduces another architect, Arjun Singh. Arjun is religious (he recites the "Hanuman Chalisa" every day) and devoted to his family; but he is also in love with Lisa. This meets strong disapproval from his family because Lisa (born of a British father and an Indian mother) is of mixed faith. Arjun decides to marry Lisa anyway. As he travels to Mumbai, his father and his brothers intercept his car, beat him up and try to burn Lisa alive. Arjun fights back and decides to disavow his faith (and thus, his family) for Lisa. He ultimately becomes an atheist.
The "haveli" project is handed to Arjun's firm, and Arjun and Lisa arrive at the "haveli" soon after. Strange things happen (sounds, objects moving by themselves). Arjun is unaware of the events, but Lisa soon senses a malevolent alien presence. Lisa questions Balwant (the caretaker and servant), but he feigns ignorance. He discusses the matter privately with MK, and earnestly pleads with MK to relieve Arjun and Lisa of the project for it will claim their lives just as it killed the others who came before them. The "haveli" does not wish to be destroyed, says Balwant, and that is why it reacts to anyone who wants to tear it down, including MK. (Balwant himself is unharmed because he is only acting on orders and does not carry an intent to destroy the "haveli".) MK is aware of some evil presence, but he silences Balwant with a fat bribe.
Arjun leaves for Delhi on a business trip. Lisa experiences stronger events, and confides in a local church priest. At Lisa's request, the priest arrives at the "haveli", and immediately senses a strong evil presence in the main hall of the "haveli". Later that evening, in his church rooms, he experiences an evil force, and wakes up to find a Baphomet, drawn in blood, on a wall in his room. He consults with the head priest and they quickly conclude that an evil spirit resides in the "haveli" and is specifically targeting Lisa. The priest returns to issue a stern warning for Lisa. Lisa is away, and Balwant takes the message, but does not mention it to Lisa.
Lisa becomes ill, refuses food and water and takes to bed. (Arjun spots her eating a dead animal that night, but is unable to make sense of this creepy event.) The priest returns and attempts to place a cross on Lisa. Lisa transforms into a diabolical personality and attacks the priest. Arjun engages a doctor but it turns out to be fruitless as Lisa's evil outbursts (and telekinetic attacks) simply overwhelm the hospital staff. Now convinced there is an alien force at work, Arjun storms into MK's office and demands the truth. MK reveals the name of the previous owner/occupant, Radhama, and Arjun visits her in Nawanagar.
Radhama reveals how it started in 1857 (during the Sepoy Mutiny), when she was a servant at the "haveli". A wounded mutineer, Mohan Kant, sought cover at the "haveli". He turned out to be a spy for the British forces. The owner's daughter, Gayatri, seduced him to buy time until her uncle arrived. Her uncle and his men hanged him. He vowed revenge with his dying breath, and his soul has remained in the "haveli" ever since. (Gayatri, it turns out, died in 1896; and Lisa was born on the same day.)
Arjun returns to the "haveli". The soul of the treasonous soldier has now completely possessed Lisa's body. The priest suggests an exorcism, and decides to perform it himself. The ritual begins well, but the evil soul is too powerful for the inexperienced priest, and the priest and Balwant are both killed. The evil spirit impels Lisa to slit her wrists (so as to die, and eject her soul from her body) when the spirit can carry her soul with it to hell. Unable to physically restrain Lisa, Arjun is forced to reexamine his lost faith. Now, Lisa who is empowered by the evil soul, beats Arjun badly. After Arjun is beaten badly, a possessed Lisa now emotionally tortures Arjun. Soon Arjun feels that only God can save Lisa. Arjun rises up, he limps towards Lisa and embraces her. Arjun then embraces Lisa with full might and begins reciting the Hanuman Chalisa. The evil soul is now being tortured. He tries to run but Arjun holds Lisa's body with all his might. He then drags her into a small room while reciting the Hanuman Chalisa. After some time, the evil soul is in enough pain because of listening to the words. Arjun then says "Pavantanaye Sankat Haran, Mangal Moorti Roop; Raam Lakhan Sita Sahit, Hridya Basahu Soor Bhoop" and the evil soul is flushed out of Lisa's body. The evil soul runs out in extreme pain and is eventually destroyed. In the end, Gayathri's portrait is removed and sent away from the mansion.
Production.
Director Vikram Bhatt's previous films "Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage" (2002), "Deewane Huye Paagal" (2005) and "Life Mein Kabhie Kabhie" were termed as box-office failures in the media. Speaking in corroboration, Bhatt felt the need for introspection for making inconsequential cinema. His want to make a horror film stemmed from the visuals of a chariot riding through the mist that constantly played in his mind. Claiming it to be his most ambitious project to date, Bhatt took a year and a half to complete the script, which was more powerful than his earlier film "Raaz" (2002).
Though Bhatt was looking to cast newcomers, he did not conduct any auditions for the film. Instead, when Rajneesh Duggal and Adah Sharma came to his office, his search for the lead cast ended. For their enthusiasm and efforts, Bhatt was delighted to work with them. Sharma found Bhatt to be a very calm, composed and patient director to work with. Duggal, who won the 2003 Mr. India title, was a New Delhi-based model in the fashion industry. While filming, both of them felt quite comfortable working with each other.
For scouting for an appropriate location for filming, the production house hired six location managers who visited about 12 countries over a period of six months before settling down on Allerton Castle, North Yorkshire, England. When Bhatt saw the images of this house, he was convinced that it would be the real protagonist of his film. This mansion was owned by a billionaire,who lived with his wife and he killed a carpenter. The carpenter's spirit is rumored to be haunting the place. Bhatt and Sharma experienced an unusual incident while filming at this house. Inside the mansion, a huge portrait of the lady is hung on one of its walls. When they attempted to take a photograph of this portrait, the picture always came out blurred, no matter what angle they took it from.
One of the producers of the movie, Surendra Sharma, said "never has a supernatural thriller been attempted in a period setting and made at this scale." His father-cinematographer Pravin Bhatt and he decided to shoot in candlelight to recreate the conditions during the year of setting – 1920. At the same time, they hoped to fill every frame with artistry and create the eeriness of a cold haunting. Director Bhatt watched a lot footage of true accounts of poltergeists and hauntings. In addition, he wanted to establish the same style of portraits of this period. To achieve this, instead of resorting to computer graphics, he asked Anjorie Alag, the supporting actress to pose for five hours in front of an artist. The entire shoot was completed in a 12-hour night shift for a 18 days during the winter.
To further enhance the effect of horror for this film, Ashoke Chowdhury and Indraneil Roy were hired to work on the visual effects. When they approached Bhatt and showed him samples of their previous work, they were hired with the instructions that he expected good, international quality work. During their work, the film was treated digitally using a specialized software. Using this, they were able to make glasses break and generate smoke. They made use of techniques such as chroma, rotoscoping and wire-rigs for levitation. One of their most challenging scenes in the film was to recreate Mumbai's Victoria Terminus as it was in 1920. This required them 40 days of work.
Several scenes within the movie are identical to scenes in "The Exorcist", "The Exorcism of Emily Rose", "Stigmata" and "One Missed Call".
While Adnan Sami composed the music for the film, Sameer penned the lyrics. Pandit Jasraj, Shubha Mudgal, Parveen Sultana, Asha Bhosle and Kailash Kher feature in the soundtrack.
Release.
A coffee-table book, with trivia and in-depth detail about the film, was launched prior to the film's release. Bhatt thought that the audience will find it better to read about the film before its release. The film released on 12 September 2008.
Music.
The music of the film is composed by Adnan Sami with lyrics by Sameer.
Box office.
"1920" was not expected to do well. However, it grossed a surprising amount of in the first week, emerging a success. It further grossed and in second and third weeks respectively, thus collecting and was declared a 'Hit' all over. It finished at approx in India.
Sequel.
A sequel called "" was also released in 2012, featuring Aftab Shivdasani and Tia Bajpai in lead roles. It was also declared a 'Hit', earning in 3 weeks domestically.
After, the success of the first two installments, the makers have decided to produce the third instalment "1920 London" starring Meera Chopra and Diganth.

Albert Cooper (flute maker)

Albert Cooper (April 12, 1924 – January 25, 2011) was a British flute maker who apprenticed at Rudall Carte until the war. After discharge, he returned to Rudall Carte but left in 1959 and set himself up as flute maker.
Flutes manufactured.
Cooper's primary contribution to flute making is the Cooper Scale, where the position and size (opening) of the flute's tone holes have been accurately determined. This has been now universally adopted and is promoted by all the major flute makers, in particular the flute maker Brannen Brothers. This new scale replaces the old Boehm System scale and measurements still being used in flute manufacture into the 1990s.

Trumpet Concerto (Michael Haydn)

Michael Haydn's Trumpet Concerto in C major, MH 60, was completed in 1763, and "is one of the most difficult in the entire repertory." The work is in two movements:
Confusingly, this concerto is sometimes listed as Trumpet Concerto No. 2 in C major, but the Trumpet Concerto No. 1 in D major, MH 104, is technically two excerpts from a divertimento and not a concerto proper.
Besides the solo trumpet in C, the concerto is scored for 2 flutes, strings, and continuo. Part of the difficulty of the concerto is because of the very high notes for the trumpet, which is written even higher than the flutes (indeed, the solo trumpet part is much higher than would be advisable for the modern trumpet, while the flute parts are too low for modern flutes to be heard clearly against a full string section). Both movements provide room for a cadenza; Edward H. Tarr's edition for Musica Rara writes out cadenzas in the trumpet part but not in the conductor's score. Tarr's cadenza for the second movement even goes up to a G above high C but provides ossia for the next lower G.
Discography.
Niklas Eklund has recorded it with the Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble conducted by Nils-Erik Sparf on a Naxos Records album entitled "The Art of the Baroque Trumpet", Vol. 4, which includes other concertos for natural trumpet (i.e., no valves, keys or slides). But generally, recordings of Michael Haydn's Trumpet Concerto typically also include Joseph Haydn's much more famous Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major

Gnathabelodon

Gnathabelodon is an extinct proboscidean (elephant) genus endemic to North America that includes species that lived during the Middle to Late Miocene. They were called "Spoon-billed Mastodons" since their lower jaw was elongated and shaped like a shoe-horn or spoon. The genus "Gnathabelodon" consists of two species: Thorpe's Spoon-billed Mastodon ("G. thorpei") and Buckner's Spoon-billed Mastodon ("G. buckneri"). The flaring of the tip of their lower jaw was similar to that of the "shovel-tuskers" (Platybelodon and Amebelodon) however "Gnathabelodon" species are distinct in having no lower tusks whilst the "shovel tuskers" have broad, flattened lower tusks. The upper tusks are large and curve outwards and upwards. In respects to dentition and overall body form, it was similar to other species of "Gomphotherium".

Changes (Will Young song)

"Changes" is a pop song recorded by British singer Will Young for his fourth studio album, "Let It Go". The song was released as the album's lead single on 15 September 2008, as a digital download, with the physical release a week later.
The track was premiered on 28 July 2008 on BBC Radio 2 by presenter Ken Bruce. For the week commencing 16 August 2008, the track was added into rotation on BBC Radio 2. The track was immediately placed on the A-list, denoting heavy rotation.
The song also debuted on the first "Today's 4Music Top 10" Chart at number one on 18 August 2008.
The song was written by Young and Eg White. White was responsible for Young's hit "Leave Right Now" and has written with other artists such as James Morrison.
Video.
The video for "Changes" was shot on the 1 August 2008 on location near Tonbridge. According to his website, Young says "It has probably been the hardest video I’ve ever had to shoot. I ran up and down country lanes, was struck by lightning, set on fire and partially drowned. It’s amazing what you’ll do for music!"
He continues, saying he had to drink foul smelling soup, dance in a hay-filled barn in front of a windmachine and also had to lay on rocks, soaked in freezing cold water. It premièred on Channel V on 16 August 2008.
In the beginning Young seems to be in a deserted petrol station, filling up a petrol canister. He then looks around to find some more people sitting in their cars or sitting outside of it. Also in a shot a cow is walking along the petrol station. The next shot features Young being in and around his house. He is having a drink, listening to music and also sitting on the bed, looking out of the window. The next shot upstairs in his house shows him standing what appears to be naked in front of mirrors, singing along with the song. He then gets dressed again and slowly things in the room start to catch fire, including him.
In the next scene Young is throwing things into a big fire. He actually burns his motorbike and personal belongings like a book or photos. After that scene we see Will dancing and jumping around in a barn, with hay flying all across the room. The music suddenly stops for a second and a voice appears, asking him what he is doing in that barn. He then gets kicked out and the next shot features Will running along a lonely dark street. He looks at the sky which is filling with clouds. Little sparks suddenly appear on Young's shoulders and as he runs along the street he gets struck by a lightning.
He lays motionless on the street for some seconds. It also starts to rain very heavily. The last shot shows him opening his eyes and lifting his head.

Ratsimilaho

Ratsimilaho (c.1694 – 1750) was a ruler of an east coastal region of Madagascar. He is said to be the son of an English pirate and a Malagasy queen, Antavaratra Rahena. The region, known as the Betsimisaraka confederation covered 400 miles of coast and this legacy was created by Ratsimilaho. The Betsimisaraka make up approximately fifteen percent of the Malagasy people and are the second largest group in Madagascar after the Merina.
Biography.
Ratsimilaho was reputedly born as a result of the hospitality shown by a Malagasy queen, Antavaratra Rahena, to an English pirate when he arrived to show his accreditation as a privateer. The pirate is said to have adopted the resulting child and taken the boy briefly to England where he had some education. Now "according to most chroniclers", whilst Ratsimilaho had been away there had been a redistribution of power. The tribes to the south under their leader Ramano had captured the territory to the north of Tamatave as they were jealous of the riches arising from the trade with the Europeans.
Ratsimilaho's initial approach was to negotiate with Ramano and the Tsikoa clans, but this proved impossible. He therefore called a meeting, a "kabary", of the leaders and after much debate he persuaded them to give him the power to lead them in a battle. Ratsimilaho was given the title of "filoha be" and he used this power to create a new state. Driving out the Southern clans and resisting their later attempts at reinvasion he was victorious. The southern tribes were then called "those who wear red mud".
In 1712 Ratsimilato obtained a new treaty and it was at this time that his people took on the title of "Betsimisaraka" meaning "the many who will not be sundered", whilst his descendants were known as the "Zana-Malatas", the "children of the mulattos". He is said to have requested a wife from the people known as "Zafimbolamena" (Grandchildren of Gold) who were part of the "Sakalava" people. The resulting child, a son, was named Zanahary - a name now used in Madagascar to mean a God.
Ramaromanompo was the new name taken by Ratsimilaho meaning "he who is served by many". This important Betsimisaraka federation lasted principally until 1750/51, ending either because of the death of the "filoha be" or because of internal squabbles.
The confederation continued after his death but there was pressure from outside and disagreement within. However his legacy, the Betsimisaraka territory included the important port Toamasina, Fenerive, Maroansetra commanding Antongil Bay, the largest bay in Madagascar.
After his death his daughter, Bity, became queen. She had married a French corporal and it said that this is what gave France its first claim. She reigned with her husband, until Ratsimilaho's son, Zanahary, became leader.

Jubilee (Ten Shekel Shirt album)

Jubilee is the third album by the band Ten Shekel Shirt. It was originally released on August 19, 2008 by Rounder Records but after parting ways with the label Jubilee was re-released independently in 2009.
From the Ten Shekel Shirt website: "The origin of the word Jubilee has nothing to do with a wedding anniversary or a schmaltzy Las Vegas show. It has everything to do with the emancipation of slaves and the celebration of freedom and justice. When the band's front man "Lamont Hiebert" wrote the title track, "Jubilee", he combined that ancient meaning of the word with the true story of a young girl rescued from slavery and her first moments in a safehome."

Death Canyon Barn

The Death Canyon Barn is a combination barn and ranger patrol cabin in Grand Teton National Park. The barn was built in Death Canyon on the Death Canyon Trail at its junction with the Alaska Basin Trail by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935 in the National Park Service rustic style. Located with a clear view of Prospector Mountain, it shares a common style and purpose with the Cascade Canyon Barn to the north in the park, with minor differences attributable to available materials and the preferences of the work crews building the barns.
History.
The 1½ story log building was designed by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Design. Built as a barn, it became a patrol cabin in 1945. It was built by workers from CCC Hot Springs Camp #NP-3 or Jenny Lake Camp #NP-4, working out of the Phelps Lake Spike Camp. A proposed cabin to house trail maintenance tools and personnel was never completed, so the barn was converted to that purpose shortly after the CCC was dissolved. In the 1950s it briefly housed a seasonal ranger station.
Design.
The rustic log cabin features saddle-notched log corners on a stone foundation. The foundation is buttressed at the corners to support the projecting log ends, a feature typical of Park Service designs of the era. The original wide barn door has been filled in with windows and a personnel door. The interior consists of a large main room with a small tack room in the southwest corner, now used for tool storage. The partition uses vertical poles faced with 4-1/2: wide tongue and groove planks. A loft is framed with logs and 8" rough-cut decking, reached by a milled-lumber stairway. The loft deck is covered with 6" wide flooring planks. The roof structure is open to the underside of the roof, with exposed log trusses.The hayloft was converted to a sleeping loft. The furnishings include a rodent-proof food storage bock and a propane stove. The adjoining corral enclosure is listed as a contributing feature, with standing trees supporting most of the fence enclosure.
The Death Canyon Barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1998.

Puy d'Arras

The Puy d'Arras, called in its own day the Puy Notre-Dame, was a medieval poetical society formed in Arras for holding contests between trouvères and "pour maintenir amour et joie" (for maintaining love and joy, i.e. the courtly love lyric). The term "puy" is Old French for "place of eminence", from Latin "podium". The president of the Puy, elected annually, was titled the "Prince du Puy", and he presided over the competitions, which were decided by panels of judges. The Puy was under the nominal patronage of the Virgin Mary, referred to as "Notre Dame du Puy d'Arras". Other "puys" under her patronage were founded at Amiens, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Caen, Évreux, and Rouen. 
The Puy is less well-documented than the contemporary Confrérie des jongleurs et bourgeois d'Arras, and the two are sometimes conflated. The statutes of the Puy d'Arras do not survive, only the later ones of the Puy d'Amiens from 1471 shed any light on the nature of laws of the "puys". The Puy d'Arras was, unlike the Confrérie, neither social nor religious in conception. It was the creation of the urban patriciate, the wealthy and noble, plus some others, possibly those excluded from the Confrérie, who determined to maintain the courtly tradition. The Puy was thus more conservative than the Confrérie. 
The poets Andrieu Contredit d'Arras and Jean de Renti (criticisingly) make mention of it and its contests. Jean Bretel mentions it in his works and he is recorded elsewhere as having served a term as Prince. Undoubtedly the highest personage to attend the Puy's festivals was Theobald I of Navarre. The high standing of the Puy is evidenced in the thirteenth-century poem "Dit artésien". 
By the nature of its activities, one of the favoured verse forms of the Puy was the "jeu parti". Women could also participate in the Puy, both as contestants, audience members, and as judges. It has been suggested that the chansonnier known as trouvère manuscript "R", which contains no musical notation and is rather unornamented, was compiled from oral performance at the Puy d'Arras.

All That (season 7)

The first episode of the seventh season on "All That" featured special guests Frankie Muniz and Aaron Carter and aired on January 19, 2002. This season ran from January 19, 2002 to May 4, 2002 with 13 episodes aired, the fewest out of all the other seasons. The season was taped from early 2001 to late 2001.
Many changes happened to the show before the start of this season. The entire cast of the previous season left the show. Nickelodeon replaced them with new cast members, who would bring in fresh material. The new cast included Chelsea Brummet, Jack DeSena, Lisa Foiles, Bryan Hearne, Shane Lyons, Giovonnie Samuels and Kyle Sullivan.
Other changes occurred before the start of the season as well. The show got rid of the long-running sketch "Vital Information". Which had been featured in every show since the second episode of the first season. Instead the replaced it with a new sketch called "Know Your Stars". Which was featured in almost every episode of this season and onward. The show also got rid of the traditional green room, where the cast would hang out. In this season, the cast would be featured walking around the studio instead of being in one area. Another change was the absence Kevin Kopelow. A long-running gag in the first six seasons was Kevin The Stage Manager, who was usually hurt in some way. Instead he replaced with Pickle Boy. A random person who would usually be seen offering people pickle.
In conjunction with the seventh season, "All That" brought in weekly special guest stars who helped open the show and participated in some of the sketches. In away to promote the show better. Special guest stars started appearing on the show. Some included: Melissa Joan Hart, Frankie Muniz, Tony Hawk, David Arquette, Britney Spears, Aaron Carter, Will Friedle, Christina Vidal, Matthew Lillard, Ray Romano, Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara ("Spy Kids"), Nick Carter, Justin Timberlake, Buddy Hackett, Barry Watson, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Tom Green, and former "Guiding Light" star Brittany Snow. Former cast members Kenan Thompson and Amanda Bynes also guest starred and reprised some of their characters. Also, during this season there was supposed to be a scheduled performance by singer Aaliyah but due to her death the performance was made by a different musical guest.
Some viewers didn't appreciate the intensified emphasis on special guest stars, since "All That" it was only a 30-minute program (including commercials).
The new cast also debuted with a new intro. Unlike the first 6 seasons the audience wasn't show before the intro. The intro did however include the "Oh" sign as like past seasons. The intro featured the cast dancing in front of a large lighted "All That" logo. They are all wearing white. Their names appear on the bottom of the screen and are in bright red lettering. After Sullivan is shown, the intro cuts to the cast dancing again before showing the host and the musical guest. The intro ends with the cast walking into camera shot, while all the lights go off.

Alexander Konstantinovich Benckendorff

Count Alexander Konstantinovich Benckendorf ()(1 August 1849 – 11 January 1917) was a Russian diplomat, who served as ambassador to Denmark and the United Kingdom.
Biography.
He was born in 1846, the son of Count Constantin Alexander von Benckendorff and Princess Louise de Croy, and educated in France and Germany before entering the diplomatic service in 1869. He began as an attaché in Florence, and eventually served in Rome. He resigned in 1876 and lived nearly ten years on his estates, in St. Petersburg and abroad.
He married Countess Sophie Shouvaloff in 1879, and was survived by a son and a daughter. A younger son died in one of the first battles of World War I on the East Prussian front.
Returning to diplomacy in 1886, he became First Secretary at the Embassy in Vienna, and from 1897 to 1903 he was the Ambassador to Denmark. The Copenhagen post gave him a vantage point for watching the principal moving powers of European politics since the matrimonial alliances of the Danish royal family occasionally brought together in a friendly family circle the widow of Alexander III, Nicholas II and the Prince of Wales who was to become King Edward VII. In this way, Count Benckendorff received his initiation into the spirit of an Anglo-Russian rapprochement even before it actually resulted in an entente.
From 1903 until his death in 1917, he was the Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, the chief Russian diplomat in the United Kingdom. His major achievement was to organise the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907, which solidified relations between the two nations and helped create the Triple Entente, the alignment which would later become the Allied Powers of the First World War.
Death.
Alexander Konstantinovich Benckendorff died on 11 January 1917 and was buried inside the Westminster Cathedral, where he worshipped weekly. Benckendorff was also a convert to Roman Catholicism from Lutheranism.

Shortly after taking office as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California, O'Brien disbanded the U.S. Attorneys office in Los Angeles whose target was corruption of public officials, elected officials, and other governmental regulators. O'Brien explained that the unit's 17 lawyers would be farmed out to other sections in the office.
Inquiry of Cardinal Roger Mahony.
In 2009, O'Brien launched an inquiry of Cardinal Roger Mahony, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church's Los Angeles Archdiocese, which caused the Federal Grand Jury to take action. With the grand jury's inquiry came the possibility that Mahony would be held responsible for the many molestations that occurred by members of the clergy who the cardinal had reason to suspect were pedophiles. O'Brien was responsible for bringing the suit to light. There's a possibility that the "let's-move-on attitude might have gained traction were it not for U.S. Attorney Thomas P. O'Brien." The grand jury probe by O'Brien's office examined whether or not Mahony would be held accountable for leaving multiple sexual predators, including two convicted child molesters, serving in the ministry "until 2002 when a legal settlement in a clergy sexual abuse case mandated their removal." The suit was later dropped as it was filed under the "honest services act", a law which is usually only applied to public officials and not members of the church.
Government expense account.
After O'Brien resigned as United States Attorney in September 2009. Shortly thereafter, an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department Inspector General uncovered that O'Brien stayed at pricey hotels while traveling and then sought government reimbursement by telling his secretary to lie and state falsely that more affordable rooms were not available. The report found that O'Brien's claims for reimbursement were "inappropriate and egregious" ethics violations. O'Brien denied telling his secretary to make false statements, but when interviewed by investigators he then blamed his secretary. Investigators found O'Brien's claims to be neither "credible or persuasive," the report said. O'Brien maintained his innocence.
However as of November 2010, O’Brien made right with the case and has stated that "he didn’t do anything wrong," but told the L.A. Times that he takes “full responsibility” for excessive spending caused by any errors. The former U.S. Attorney paid an amount of money to the Department of Justice to cover hotel bills the Inspector General report identified as excessive.

The Moon and the Bonfires

The Moon and the Bonfires is an English translation of the novel "La Luna e i Falò", by the Italian poet and novelist Cesare Pavese. The book was written in Italian in 1949. It is considered Pavese's best novel.
The first English language translation was undertaken by L. Sinclair in 1952. A more recent translation by R.W. Flint, published in 2002, uses the arguably more correct translation of the "The Moon and the Bonfires", taking account of the use of the plural "i Falò" in the original Italian title.
The novel is set in the small town of Santo Stefano Belbo, in Piedmont, north-west Italy. The main protagonist, known only by his nickname of "Anguilla" (Eel), has returned to his home town in the years immediately following the Second World War. He had left just before the war, ostensibly for political reasons, and had made his fortune in the United States. Returning to his home town, he finds many of the same smells and sights that filled his youth, but he also finds a town and its inhabitants that have been deeply changed by war and by the passage of time.

ICI-118,551

ICI-118,551 is a selective beta-2 (β2) adrenergic receptor antagonist. ICI binds to the β2 subtype with at least 100 times greater affinity than β1 or β3, the two other known subtypes of the beta adrenoceptor. The compound was developed by Imperial Chemical Industries, which was acquired by AkzoNobel in 2008. 
ICI-118,551 has no known therapeutic use in humans although it has been used widely in research to understand the action of the β2 adrenergic receptor, as few other specific antagonists for this receptor are known. When dissolved in saline, the compound crosses the blood–brain barrier. Common systemic doses used in rodent research are .5 or 1 mg/kg although efficacy has been demonstrated at doses as low as .0001 mg/kg in rhesus monkeys. Doses up to 20 mg/kg have been used without toxicity. At room temperature in saline, the ICI 118,551 hydrochloride is soluble to at least 2.5 mg/mL.

Adelswärd (comital family)

The comital family Adelswärd is descended from the Baronial family Adelswärd. Baron Eric Reinhold Adelswärd (1778-1840) was created a Swedish Count 19 June 1823 at Stockholm Palace by King Charles XIV John of Sweden, in accordance with the 37th paragraph of the instrument of government of 1809, meaning only the head of the family would be a Count. He was introduced at Riddarhuset 1 June 1825 as comital family number 138. His son Eric August Adolph Adelswärd (1817-1853), who became a Count at the death of his father, abandoned the title with royal permission 30 November 1840 for him and his issue, thus making the comital family extinct.

Mtwapa

Mtwapa is a town located in Kenya's Kilifi County. The town is situated approximately north-east of Mombasa on the Mombasa-Malindi road. The town is also the location of the Mombasa-Mtwapa matatu terminus. Mtwapa Creek is an Indian Ocean inlet at Mtwapa, which is the border between Mombasa and Mtwapa (connected through a bridge). Mtwapa Creek is a starting point for deep sea fishing tours. In town is a 19th-century prison more commonly known as Shimo la tewa.
Origins of the town's name.
There are unconfirmed myths about how the town gained its name. One such myth is that the original community in the area would often seek acknowledgment if the person living in the area was "mtu wa hapa" - in Swahili, this loosely translates to 'he who lives among us'. The phrase was used to prevent a person otherwise unknown to the rest of the community from being ostracized from the area as an outsider.
Infrastructural developments.
Mtwapa is one of the coastal regions fastest growing property markets. There have been recent developments of recreational centers, religious buildings, residential homes and low cost rental villas. Second only to the southern coast (Diani area) Mtwapa is home to a large number of European retirees and holiday makers from countries such as Germany, Holland and Britain who have built homes in the vicinity.

<doc id="18850823" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18850823" title="A Fable for Critics">
A Fable for Critics

A Fable for Critics is a book-length poem by American writer James Russell Lowell, first published anonymously in 1848. The poem made fun of well-known poets and critics of the time and brought notoriety to its author.
Overview.
"A Fable for Critics" satirized many of the most important figures in American literature at the time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and James Fenimore Cooper. Many of his harshest judgments were aimed at names that have not survived in posterity, including Nathaniel Parker Willis, Cornelius Mathews, and Fitz-Greene Halleck. He gave ample praise to Charles Frederick Briggs and Lydia Maria Child, though he was friends with both and likely allowed his friendship to inflate his assessment of their talents. Of Edgar Allan Poe, he said he was "three-fifths genius... and two-fifths sheer fudge". Lowell included himself as well, referring to himself as having difficulty determining the difference "'twixt singing and preaching". Many of the poetic portraits were balanced with praise, as in Halleck's:
Lowell's most vicious treatment was aimed at Margaret Fuller, whom he referred to as Miranda. At first, he intended to exclude her entirely but thought it more insulting not to include her and was convinced to write "a line or two" by his wife Maria White Lowell. Ultimately, his characterization was the only which was wholly negative and not balanced with praise. He suggested that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own and that she was only genuine in her spite.
Publication history.
"A Fable for Critics", with the subtitle "A Glance at a Few of Our Literary Progenies", was published anonymously as a pamphlet early in 1848. Three thousand copies were sold in short order. Lowell had hoped there would be sufficient profit from his sales, which he intended to turn over to his financially struggling friend Briggs, though it was said the profit was only enough to purchase one small silver plate. The poem was reprinted several times with Lowell's name after its initial publication. One version included an introductory note explaining its author's intentions: "This "jeu d'esprit" was extemporized, I may fairly say, so rapidly was it written, purely for my own amusement and with no thought of publication" until convinced to do so by Briggs.
Critical response.
John Ruskin labeled the poem "in animal spirit and power... almost beyond anything I know". Oliver Wendell Holmes found it "capital—crammed full and rammed down hard—with powder (lots of it)—shot—slugs—very little wadding... all crowded into a rusty-looking sort of blunderbuss barrel, as it were—capped with a percussion preface—and cocked with a title page as apropos as a wink to a joke". Henry Wadsworth Longfellow compared it to Lord Byron's "English Bards" as being "full of wild wit and deviltry, and amazingly clever". Freeman Hunt reviewed the poem for "Merchants' Magazine" in December 1848 and remarked on how true the character assessments were: "Our friends Bryant, Halleck, Willis, Whittier, Poe, and last but not least, Harry Franco, (Briggs,) are, in our judgment, as genuine life pictures as were ever sketched with pen or pencil, in prose or verse. The severity, if any, is lost in the general fidelity of the delineations."
Lowell's friends objected to the intense criticism of Fuller, specifically William Wetmore Story and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Edgar Allan Poe reviewed the work in the "Southern Literary Messenger" and called it "'loose'—ill-conceived and feebly executed, as well in detail as in general... we confess some surprise at his putting forth so unpolished a performance". His final judgment was that the work was not successful: "no failure was ever more complete or more pitiable". Ultimately, "A Fable for Critics" earned Lowell notoriety as a poet, once his name was revealed, though he did not significantly profit from its publication.

Nalanda University

Nalanda University (also known as University of Nalanda) is the name of a proposed university in Rajgir, near Nalanda, Bihar, India. The first academic session is set to start from 2014. The university is a plan for reviving and re-establishing Nalanda University which was one of the oldest ancient higher-learning institutions. Originally the university was established in the 5th century AD by Gupta Kings.
History.
Origin.
Historical studies suggest that the University of Nalanda was established during the reign of a king called Śakrāditya. Both Xuanzang and Prajñavarman cite him as the founder, as does a seal discovered at the site.
Nalanda University was the first great university in recorded history and one of the world's first residential university as it had dormitories for students. It is also one of the most famous universities. In its heyday, it accommodated over 10,000 students and 2,000 teachers. The university was considered an architectural masterpiece, and was marked by a lofty wall and one gate. Nalanda had eight separate compounds and ten temples, along with many other meditation halls and classrooms. On the grounds were lakes and parks. The library was located in a nine storied building where meticulous copies of texts were produced.
The Tang Dynasty Chinese pilgrim and scholar Xuanzang studied, taught and spent nearly 15 years at Nalanda University. He has left detailed accounts of the university in the 7th century. Yijing has also left information about the other kingdoms lying on the route between China and the Nālandā university. He was responsible for the translation of a large number of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Chinese.
Destruction and demise.
According to records of history, Nalanda University was destroyed three times by invaders, but only rebuilt twice. The first time was by the Huns under Mihirakula during the reign of Skandagupta (455–467 AD). But Skanda's successors promptly undertook the restoration, improving it with even grander buildings, and endowed it with enough resources to let the university sustain itself in the longer term.
The second destruction came with an assault by the Gaudas in the early 7th century. This time, the Hindu king Harshavardhana (606–648 AD) restored the Buddhist university.
The final blow came when it was violently destroyed in an Turkic attack led by Bakhtiyar Khilji in 1193. In 1193, the Nalanda University was sacked by Bakhtiyar Khilji, a Muslim Turk; this event is seen by scholars as a late milestone in the decline of Buddhism in India. The Persian historian Minhaj-i-Siraj, in his chronicle the "Tabaquat-I-Nasiri", reported that thousands of monks were burned alive and thousands beheaded as Khilji tried his best to uproot Buddhism.
Academia.
At its peak, the university attracted scholars and students from Korea, Japan, China, Tibet, Indonesia, Turkey, Greece, and Persia. The subjects taught included religion, history, law, linguistics, medicine, public health, architecture, metallurgy, pharmacology, sculpture and astronomy.
Notable scholars who studied at Nalanda included Harshavardhana, Vasubandhu, Dharmapala, Suvishnu, Asanga, Silabhadra, Dharmakirti, Shantarakshita, Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Padmasambhava (the reputed founder of Buddhism in Tibet), Xuanzang and Hwui Li.
Formation and reconstruction.
Nalanda University Bill.
On 28 March 2006 then President of India A.P.J.Abdul Kalam proposed the idea while addressing the Joint Session of the Bihar Vidhan Mandal for revival of Nalanda university. The Nalanda University Bill, 2010 was passed on 21 August 2010 in Rajya Sabha and 26 August 2010 in Lok Sabha. The bill received Presidential assent on 21 September 2010 thereby becoming an Act. The University came into existence on 25 November 2010, when the Act was implemented.
International funding.
Japan and Singapore are financing the construction work, with contributions totalling around US$100 million. Gopa Sabharwal has been appointed the first Vice-Chancellor of this university in February 2011.
It has been estimated that US$500m will be required to build the new facility, with a further US$500m needed to sufficiently improve the surrounding infrastructure. The group is looking for donations from governments, private individuals and religious groups.
The State Government of Bihar handed over 443 acres of sprawling land acquired from local people, to the University, where construction work has begun. It is a dream project of the former Indian president APJ Abdul Kalam.
Infrastructure and architecture.
For best architectural design, a global competition was held for construction of an international state-of-the-art institution. Vastu Shilpa Consultants have been selected as the winner of the design competition with dbHMS providing the triple net-zero energy, water and waste strategic plan.
Organization and administration.
Governing Board.
In 2007, the Government of India constituted a Nalanda Mentor Group (NMG) under the Chairmanship of Professor Amartya Sen to examine the framework of international co-operation, and proposed structure of partnership, which would govern the establishment of this University as an international centre of education. The University of Nalanda is proposed to be established under the aegis of the East Asia Summit (EAS), as a regional initiative. The NMG also has representatives from Singapore, China, Japan and Thailand.
Later the Nalanda Mentor Group was renamed the Governing Board of Nalanda University.
The Governing Board of Nalanda University consists of:
Popular culture.
Based on inspiration from ancient Nalanda University, Naropa University was established in 1974 at Boulder, Colorado in the United States of America.

The Awful Truth (1929 film)

The Awful Truth was a 1929 American romantic comedy film, distributed by Pathé Exchange, directed by Marshall Neilan, and starring Ina Claire and Henry Daniell. The screenplay was written by Horace Jackson and Arthur Richman, based on a play by Richman. Ina Claire starred in the original stage version on Broadway in 1922. The film is now considered lost.
Other versions.
There were two film versions of the original play on which the 1929 film was based: a 1925 silent version with Agnes Ayres and Warner Baxter; and a best-known version made in 1937 with Irene Dunne and Cary Grant. The play was remade unsuccessfully in color, as the musical "Let's Do It Again" (1953) starring Jane Wyman and Ray Milland.

United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2008

The 2008 congressional elections in Tennessee were held on November 4, 2008 to determine who will represent the state of Tennessee in the United States House of Representatives. Tennessee has nine seats in the House, apportioned according to the 2000 United States Census. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; the elected served in the 111th Congress from January 4, 2009 until January 3, 2011. The election coincided with the 2008 U.S. presidential election.
District 1.
This district covers northeast Tennessee, including all of Carter, Cocke, Greene, Hamblen, Hancock, Hawkins, Johnson, Sullivan, Unicoi, and Washington counties and parts of Jefferson County and Sevier County. It has been represented by Republican David Davis since 2007.
Johnson City mayor Roe narrowly defeated Davis in the Republican primary by a margin of 50% to 49% (only 500 votes). Davis was elected in 2006, succeeding retiring congressman Bill Jenkins, winning the Republican nomination over a crowded field which included Roe. Roe, a retired OB/GYN, was endorsed by several local newspapers, refused PAC and special interest money, and promised not to serve any more than ten years in Congress. He was a shoo-in for election in a district which has only elected Republicans since 1880.
District 2.
This district lies in the east central part of the state, based in Knoxville and is largely coextensive with that city's metropolitan area. It has been represented by Republican Jimmy Duncan since November, 1988. He is running against Democrat Bob Scott. No Democrat has held this seat since 1855. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
District 3.
This district has been represented by Republican Zach Wamp since 1995. His Democratic opponent was Doug Vandagriff. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
District 4.
This district lies in Middle and East Tennessee and includes all of Bledsoe, Campbell, Coffee, Cumberland, Fentress, Franklin, Giles, Grundy, Lawrence, Lewis, Lincoln, Marion, Maury, Moore, Morgan, Pickett, Scott, Sequatchie, Van Buren, Warren, and White Counties, as well as portions of Hickman, Roane, and Williamson counties. It has been represented by Democrat Lincoln Davis since 2003. He ran against Republican Monty Lankford. Although the 4th is one of the few districts in the nation that is not considered safe for either party, its size and the fact it includes five television markets makes it fairly easy for incumbents to tenure themselves in. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
District 5.
This district lies in Middle Tennessee, including almost all of Davidson County, half of Wilson County, and half of Cheatham County. Nearly two-thirds of the district's voting population lives in Nashville. It has been represented by Democrat Jim Cooper since 2003. He ran against Republican Gerard Donovan. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
District 6.
This district lies in Middle Tennessee, including all of Bedford, Cannon, Clay, DeKalb, Jackson, Macon, Marshall, Overton, Putnam, Robertson, Rutherford, Smith, Sumner, and Trousdale Counties, as well as a portion of Wilson County. It has been represented by Democrat Bart Gordon since 1985. He ran against independent candidate Chris Baker. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
District 7.
This district lies in Middle and southwestern Tennessee, connecting suburbs of Memphis and Nashville. It has been represented by Republican Marsha Blackburn since 2003. She ran against Democrat Randy G. Morris. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
District 8.
This district covers roughly the northwestern part of the state. It has been represented by Democrat John S. Tanner since 1989. He ran unopposed by any party candidates and encountered opposition from only a few write-in votes. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
District 9.
This district lies in southwestern Tennessee, located entirely within Shelby County and including most of the city of Memphis. It has been represented by Democrat Steve Cohen since 2007, who ran against independent candidates Jake Ford, Dewey Clark, and Taylor Shelby Wright. CQ Politics forecasts the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
Cohen defeated attorney Nikki Tinker by a 79% to 19% margin in the Democratic primary. Cohen, who is the only white congressman representing a majority black district, defeated Tinker, who is black, by a much narrower margin in 2006. There was much controversy over accusations made by the Tinker campaign that Cohen was involved with the Ku Klux Klan, and circulation of anti-Semitic propaganda against Cohen, who is Jewish. No Republican filed in this overwhelmingly Democratic district, although Cohen's primary victory assured him of a second term in any case.

Mickey's Circus

"Mickey's Circus" is an animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released 1 August 1936. Known crew include director Ben Sharpsteen and animators Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, Al Eugster & Shamus Culhane.
Although the film is called Mickey's Circus, the film mostly features Donald Duck; however Mickey Mouse does feature in the beginning and end. Also featured are a trio of trained Sea Lions, a young Sea Lion pup, and an audience full of children.
Plot.
Mickey Mouse is hosting a circus featuring Donald Duck and a trio of sea lions. Children from all over come to see the circus. After Mickey introduces the performers, the show starts. Donald enters the ring only to be stampeded by the sea lions and a young sea lion pup (Salty the Seal). The first act is juggling, in which the sea lions and Donald juggle balls that land on their noses. When the stunt is finished, the sea lions beg to be fed, throwing their balls at Donald and pointing to their mouths. Before Donald can feed the last sea lion, Salty intervenes and steals the fish. The resulting tug-of-war ends in the sea lions fighting over the fish. The next act is playing the organ pipe, but the sea lion can't do it right. Salty interferes and plays the tune "Yankee Doodle" instead, but the crowd cheers anyway. Salty distracts Donald to the point where Donald looses his temper, attacks Salty, and gets stuck in a drum. Donald regains control by driving away the sea lions with his pistol.
Subsequently, the sea lions refuse to perform unless fed first. When Donald gets out a fish, the sea lion plays the tune rapidly. Again, the sea lions fight over the fish, destroying the organ pipe and ignoring Donald. Salty steals the fish again and Donald chases; there follows a fast chase around the arena, which includes Donald chasing Salty through a cannon and Mickey attempting to intervene. The spectators fire the cannon, shooting Mickey and Donald out and resulting in Mickey landing on a tightrope and Donald hanging from a hook within the fish basket. When a spectator cuts Donald's basket loose, he falls, lands on a circus bike, and rides across the tightrope toward Mickey (who somehow gets out of the way). The spectators oil the rope, causing Donald's bike to run backwards and splatter Mickey, go over Mickey's pole, bounce back from the start, and end up on top of Mickey's pole. When the spectators throw a barrel at Mickey, Donald's bike is bounced off but Donald gets back by driving through thin air and Mickey is loaded on as well. The climax ensues when the spectators turn up the voltage to high, electrocuting Mickey and Donald and splitting the bike (and rope) in half, causing Mickey and Donald to fall. The two land in the seal tank, only to be hit by a fish thrown by Salty, and the film ends with the sea lions beating up Mickey and Donald as they fight over the fish in the tank.
Release.
3 May 2004: Released on DVD as part of a two disk collection of early Mickey Mouse shorts - , part of the Walt Disney Treasures line.

Rambo (2008 film)

Rambo (also known as Rambo IV or John Rambo) is a 2008 American-German action film directed, co-written by and starring Sylvester Stallone reprising his famous role as Cold War/Vietnam veteran John Rambo. It is the fourth installment in the "Rambo" franchise, twenty years since the previous film "Rambo III". This film is dedicated to the memory of Richard Crenna, who played Col. Sam Trautman in the first three films, and who died of heart failure in 2003.
The film is about a former United States Army Special Forces soldier, John Rambo, who is hired by a church pastor to help rescue a group of missionaries who were kidnapped by men from a brutal Burmese military regime.
The film grossed $113,204,290 during its run at the international box office. After its home video release, it grossed $39,206,346 in DVD sales. The film had its cable television premiere on Spike TV on July 11, 2010. However, it was the extended cut that was broadcast, not the theatrical version. The extended cut released on Blu-ray two weeks later.
Plot.
20 years after the events in Afghanistan, amid the political protests of the crisis in Burma, ruthless military officer Major Pa Tee Tint (Maung Maung Khin) leads an army of Tatmadaw soldiers to pillage small villages in a campaign of fear. He watches with indifference as innocent villagers are forced into mine-infested marshes and orders his men to abduct the teenage boys of the villages to be drafted into his army. Former U.S. soldier John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) now lives in Thailand in a remote village near the Burmese border where he makes a living capturing and selling snakes as well as taxiing people up and down the Salween River in his boat. He is approached by missionary Michael Burnett (Paul Schulze) who requests that he and his group be ferried into Burma on a humanitarian mission to provide aid to Karen tribespeople. Rambo refuses, claiming that without weapons, there will be no changes, but is eventually persuaded by missionary Sarah Miller (Julie Benz) to make the trip.
During their trip, the boat is stopped by a trio of pirates driving a gunboat who demand Sarah in exchange for passage. After negotiations fail, Rambo kills the pirates with his cold war-era Colt M1911 and later dumps a single body in the water to conceal the evidence, as well as burning the rest of the bodies on the return trip. Michael is greatly disturbed at Rambo's actions; upon arriving in Burma, he says that the group will travel by road and will not need him for the return trip. The mission goes well until the Tatmadaw, led by Major Tint, suddenly attack, slaughtering most of the villagers and two missionaries and kidnapping the rest, including Michael and Sarah. When the missionaries fail to return after ten days, their pastor (Ken Howard) comes to ask Rambo's help to guide a hired team of five mercenaries, Lewis (Graham McTavish), School Boy (Matthew Marsden), En-Joo (Tim Kang), Reese (Jake La Botz), and Diaz (Reynaldo Galledos), to the village where the missionaries were last seen.
Rambo agrees and accompanies the mercenaries to the drop-off. He offers to help but is refused by the team's leader Lewis, an ex-Special Air Service operative, who demands he stay at the boat. As the mercenary team arrives at the village, a squad of Tatmadaw soldiers show up with a group of hostages. The soldiers are playing a game, forcing prisoners to run through a rice paddy with landmines, and betting on the outcome. The team takes cover, planning to stand by and (seemingly reluctantly) let the hostages be killed in order to avoid provoking a response from a much larger group of soldiers. Having disregarded Rambo as a simple boatman, the mercenaries are shocked when he appears and single-handedly wipes out the entire squad of Tatmadaw soldiers with his compound bow, allowing the hostages to escape unscathed.
Rambo convinces the team to avenge the massacre and save the hostages at the P.O.W. camp after he witnesses the destroyed village filled with mutilated human and animal corpses. Rambo and the mercenaries stealthily infiltrate the camp and successfully locate and rescue Sarah and the other prisoners and flee with them. Tint quickly learns of the situation and ruthlessly investigates with the help of his army. The Tatmadaw manage to capture everyone except for Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy, the group's sniper. Just as the captured mercenaries and hostages are to be executed, Rambo hijacks a jeep-mounted .50-caliber M2 machine gun and ignites an intense shootout. Tint hides as the firefight escalates and kills one of the missionaries. After this, En-Joo is killed by an M67 grenade. The Tatmadaw, having a large numerical advantage, come close to victory but the Karen rebels show up and join the fight in a valiant display of deus ex machina, turning the tide of the battle. Tint, realizing his defeat, attempts to escape the area, but Rambo intercepts and disembowels him.
In the final scene, encouraged by Sarah's words Rambo returns to his home in the United States, Rambo is seen walking along an Arizona highway until he sees a horse farm and a rusted mailbox. Reading the name "R. Rambo" Rambo smiles and walks down the gravel driveway as the credits roll.
Production.
In between the making of the third and fourth films in the "Rambo" franchise, the films' original producer, Carolco Pictures, went out of business. In 1997, Miramax Films purchased the "Rambo" franchise. The following year, Miramax subsidiary Dimension Films intended to make another film, and a writer was hired to pen the script, but any attempts to make it were deterred by Stallone, who had stated that he no longer wanted to make action movies.
Filming started on January 22, 2007 and ended on May 4, 2007. The movie was shot at Chiang Mai, Thailand as well as in Mexico and the United States in Arizona and California.
While filming near Burma, Stallone and the rest of the crew narrowly avoided being shot by the Burmese military. Stallone described Burma as a "hellhole". He said "we had shots fired above our heads" and that he "witnessed survivors with legs cut off and all kinds of land-mine injuries, maggot-infested wounds and ears cut off."
Alternative titles.
"John Rambo" was the original working title for the film but was changed because Stallone thought that audiences might think that this is the final film in the "Rambo" series (due to the then recently released Rocky Balboa), which was not his original intent. In many other countries, the title "John Rambo" is kept because the first "Rambo" movie, "First Blood", was released as "Rambo" in many foreign territories. The film premiered on television as "Rambo", but the title sequence referred to it as "John Rambo".
On October 12, 2007, Lionsgate announced that the film title was being changed to "Rambo: To Hell and Back". After some negative feedback from the online community, Stallone spoke with AICN's Harry Knowles and said: ""Lionsgate jumped the gun on this. I just was thinking that the title "John Rambo" was derivative of "Rocky Balboa" and might give people the idea that this is the last "Rambo" film, and I don't necessarily feel that it will be. He's definitely a superb athlete, there's no reason he can't continue onto another adventure. Like John Wayne with "The Searchers".""
Music.
Brian Tyler composed the original score for the film. Stallone wanted Tyler to incorporate Jerry Goldsmith's original themes into the movie. He did not rely on Goldsmith's actual theme, though he used it enough to tie this film to the others, musically, and also based his own theme and orchestrations on the style of the original to maintain the musical series. The soundtrack includes 20 tracks.
Brian Tyler also composed the soundtrack to "The Hunted" in 2003, a film with striking similarities to the first "Rambo" film, "First Blood".
Track listing
Box office.
"Rambo" opened in 2,751 North American theaters on January 25, 2008 and grossed $6,490,000 on its opening day, and $18,200,000 over its opening weekend. It was the second highest grossing movie for the weekend in the U.S. and Canada behind "Meet the Spartans".
The film has a box office gross of $113,344,290, of which $42,754,105 was from Canada and the United States.
In an unprecedented move, Europe's biggest cinema chain (and the third biggest in the world), Odeon, controversially refused to show the film on any of its screens in the United Kingdom, blaming "commercial differences". UCI followed suit in its cinemas in Ireland which were managed by Odeon. The film was, however, shown in Ireland and the United Kingdom by other theater chains such as Empire Cinemas, Vue, Cineworld and Ward Anderson. The film was not shown in the French-speaking part of Switzerland due to legal and commercial problems with the distributor, even if it was available on screens of France and the Swiss German-speaking part.
Critical reception.
The film gained mixed reviews from critics, earning a 37% "Rotten" rating on the movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.
In his review for the "New York Times", A.O. Scott wrote, "Mr. Stallone is smart enough — or maybe dumb enough, though I tend to think not — to present the mythic dimensions of the character without apology or irony. His face looks like a misshapen chunk of granite, and his acting is only slightly more expressive, but the man gets the job done. Welcome back." Michael H. Price of "Fort Worth Business Press" wrote, "Stallone invests the role with a realistic acceptance of the aging process, and with traces reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart in 1951’s "The African Queen" and Clint Eastwood in 1992’s "Unforgiven" — to say nothing of the influences that the original "First Blood" had absorbed from Marlon Brando in 1953’s "The Wild One" and Tom Laughlin in 1971’s "Billy Jack"." Jonathan Garret (a former writer for the Atlanta Journal Constitution) said in an interview: ""Rambo" is the most violent movie I have ever seen. The last 11 minutes of the film are so violent, it makes "We Were Soldiers" look like "Sesame Street"".
When asked what his take on the film was, "First Blood" writer David Morrell said:I'm happy to report that overall I’m pleased. The level of violence might not be for everyone, but it has a serious intent. This is the first time that the tone of my novel "First Blood" has been used in any of the movies. It's spot-on in terms of how I imagined the character — angry, burned-out, and filled with self-disgust because Rambo hates what he is and yet knows it's the only thing he does well. ... I think some elements could have been done better, I think this film deserves a solid three stars.
Reception in Burma.
The film is currently banned by the Burmese government. The military ruling party has ordered DVD vendors in Burma not to distribute the film due to the movie's content. Despite having never been released there theatrically or on DVD, "Rambo" is, however, available there in bootleg versions. Despite the film being unpopular among some of the population due to the negative portrayal of the Tatmadaw, the opposition youth group Generation Wave copied and distributed the film as anti-Tatmadaw propaganda.
According to Karen Freedom Fighters, the movie gave them a great boost of morale. Burmese freedom fighters have even adopted dialogue from the movie (most notably "Live for nothing, or die for something") as rallying points and battle cries. "That, to me," said Sylvester Stallone, "is one of the proudest moments I've ever had in film." Also, overseas Burmese have praised the movie for its vivid portrayal of the military's oppression of the Karen people.
Home video.
The DVD and Blu-ray Disc editions were released in the U.S. on May 27, 2008. The DVD is in 1 and 2 disc editions. The Special edition has a 2.40 anamorphic widescreen presentation and a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX track. The single editions have a standard 5.1 Dolby Digital track. The Blu-ray Disc has Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and DTS HD 7.1 Tracks. The DVD and Blu-ray Disc on disc one have the film, deleted scenes, 6 featurettes, and commentary by Sylvester Stallone. The Blu-ray Disc also has 2 extra special features, that includes a trailer gallery.
The 2-disc DVD and Blu-ray Disc editions have a digital copy of the film. There is also a 6 disc DVD set of all four "Rambo" films, packaged in a limited edition tin case with over 20 bonus features. A Blu-ray Disc set with "Rambo 1-3" was also released.
The DVD was released in the UK on June 23, 2008.
The film was the 19th best selling DVD of 2008 with 1.7m units sold and an overall gross of $39,206,346.
Extended cut.
When asked about the moral of the film in a Daily Yomiuri Online interview, Sylvester Stallone mentioned that he will be doing an Extended Cut of the film, which will go by the original title of "John Rambo". Nevertheless, the news became most well known after a May 2008 interview with Jay Leno when he announced the work of a director's cut, and that the proceeds would go to Burma. On top of this, an online petition appeared shortly after the announcement in order to "motivate" Stallone in completing this new cut. At the 2008 Comic-Con, it was vaguely announced that the director's cut (or as they labeled it, "extended cut") would be released in 2009, though no other specifics were given. Additionally, the director's cut premiered at the 2008 Zurich Film Festival. DVD Active announced it would premiere only on Blu-ray Disc in Canada and the United States on July 27, 2010. The cover art does not say "John Rambo", but simply its current title. However, in the opening credits, it goes by the name of "John Rambo".
The "new scenes" in the extended cut are the deleted scenes (seen on the Rambo 2-Disc features) just simply reinstated back. There are no new action sequences but there are a few alternations: a few new sound effects are added, the opening mine field scene is moved to appear later in the movie, Rambo's monologue about war as he carves a new blade is replaced with Reverend Marsh's prayer, a brief scene of Rambo waving to Reverend Marsh as he and the mercenaries sail off into Burma, the scene where Lewis complains on the boat is altered with different camera angles and the frame of Rambo spitting is removed, and the scene where Rambo waves back to Sarah and Michael and walks behind a jeep is reinstated. The extended cut premiered on cable television (VIA Spike TV) on July 11, 2010, two weeks before its Blu-ray release. It then had its encore presentation on August 8 and August 9, 2010, promoting Stallone's then latest film "The Expendables". The extended cut runs 99 minutes long, whereas the theatrical version runs 91 minutes.

George Baillie-Hamilton, Lord Binning

Brigadier-General George Baillie-Hamilton, Lord Binning, CB, MVO (24 December 1856 – 12 January 1917) was a British Army officer; he was styled "Lord Binning" as a courtesy title.
He was born in 1856, the second child and eldest son of George Baillie-Hamilton-Arden, 11th Earl of Haddington. After an education at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, he was commissioned in the Royal Horse Guards on 11 September 1880. He served with distinction in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, the Nile Expedition of 1884, and the Hazara campaign of 1888. In 1889 he was appointed aide-de-camp to the Viceroy of India, and from 1899 to 1903 held the command of the Royal Horse Guards. He retired from the army in 1907, but remained in the Territorial Force as commanding officer of the Lothians and Border Horse, and served as His Majesty´s Lieutenant of the County of Berwick from 1901 until he died.
He was appointed a temporary Brigadier-General in December 1915, and given command of 41st Brigade in 14th (Light) Division. He remained in command until April 1916, returning home to command 11th Mounted Brigade. 
In 1892 he had married Katharine Salting, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. He died, aged sixty, a few months before his father, and so did not succeed to the title of the Earl of Haddington; instead, it passed to his eldest son, George Baillie-Hamilton.

Amos Pizzey (born 1967) is the creative director and founder of Talenthouse Inc.
Born in West London, his mother Erin Pizzey was the founder of the women's refuge movement. He began his career in music at age 13, and was recognized for his vocal talent by Boy George. At the age of 14, Pizzey joined George’s band, Culture Club, and two years later signed his first international contract with Richard Branson at Virgin Records.
Over the next two decades, Pizzey signed with various record labels, and was also producing and remixing Madonna, George Michael, Boy George and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was during this time that he forged a close relationship with Jeremy Healy. The two had a series of hit records and created the multi-platform entertainment concept known as "Bleachin'", which tells the story of inner city club culture through film, fashion, art, music and photography.
Pizzey and Healy went on to sign the project with BMG Records, and were photographed by Annie Leibovitz for the American "Vogue" with John Galliano at his request. In 2000, Pizzey was also a founding partner of London’s Met Bar, which became a global center for outstanding artists.
In 2005, Pizzey was then approached by the CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi UK to serve as the founder and creative director of GUM connecting the youth market with global brands. During his two-year tenure there, Pizzey worked with corporations like Procter & Gamble and Atlantic Records, and was responsible for developing multi-platform brand campaigns as well as brokering entertainment and advertising deals.
Shortly thereafter, Pizzey realized that the online community and the social networking sites that dramatically increased popularity over the past few years, lacked a purely creative destination where artists could create, collaborate, and liberate their talents together. He left GUM to found the “All Creative Online Community” and now serves as founder and creative director of Talenthouse Inc. (USA). In 2008 Pizzey moved to Silicon Valley in the United States, where he lives together with his wife, the broadcaster and presenter Lisa I'Anson.

Asplenium trichomanes

Asplenium trichomanes (commonly known as maidenhair spleenwort) is a small fern in the spleenwort genus "Asplenium". It is a widespread and common species, occurring almost worldwide in a variety of rocky habitats. It is a variable fern with several subspecies.
Description.
It grows in tufts from a short rhizome. The fronds are long and narrow, gradually tapering towards the tip. They are simply divided into small, yellow-green to dark-green pinnae. The stipe and rachis of the frond are dark all along their length. The fronds can reach 40 cm in length but are more commonly 8-20 cm. They bear long, narrow sori which contain the spores.
Subspecies.
"Asplenium trichomanes" has diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid cytotypes, which it has been argued should be recognised as distinct species. A triploid cytotype (a sterile hybrid between the diploid and tetraploid cytotype) is also known. Within these cytotypes several subspecies are recognised, including
Distribution and habitat.
It is widespread in temperate and subarctic areas and also occurs in mountainous regions in the tropics. Its range includes most of Europe and much of Asia south to Turkey, Iran and the Himalayas with a population in Yemen. It occurs in northern, southern and parts of eastern Africa and also in eastern Indonesia, south-east Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand and Hawaii. It is found in North America and Central America and Cuba, and the northern and western regions of South America such as Chile.
It grows in rocky habitats such as cliffs, scree slopes, walls and mine waste, the type of rock used as a substrate depending on the subspecies. It grows from sea-level up to 3000 metres in North America while in the British Isles it reaches 870 metres.

<doc id="18851094" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18851094" title="Agdal Gardens">
Agdal Gardens

The Agdal Gardens (or Aguedal Gardens) are gardens, of about of surface, to the south of "Dar El Makhzen", the Royal Palace, and the medina in Marrakech, Morocco. Their name derives from the Berber language for "walled meadow". Extending for some , the gardens include groves of orange, lemon, fig, apricot and pomegranate trees in rectangular plots, linked by olive-lined walkways.
Together with the medina of Marrakech and the Menara Gardens, the Agdal Gardens were listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1985.
History.
The gardens were created as an orchard by Abd al-Mu'min of the Almohad dynasty in the 12th century. 
They were renovated by the Saadi dynasty and then enlarged during the reign of Moulay Abderrahmane in the 19th century, when they were enclosed with pisé walls.
Irrigation System.
The gardens are irrigated using a number of pools and ditches. A network of underground channels and ditches, known as "khettera", bring water down from the High Atlas mountains many kilometres away, via Aghmat in the Ourika Valley to the south. 
The "Dar El Hana", a small pavilion or "minzah", stands beside the largest pool, the "Sahraj el-Hana" (Tank of Health), which was used to train troops to swim. Sultan Mohammed IV died in the pool when his steam launch capsized there in 1873. His successor, Sultan Moulay Hassan, housed his harem in another pavilion in the gardens, the "Dar al Baida".

A Short Guide to the City

"A Short Guide to the City" is a 1990 short story by American horror writer Peter Straub collected in "Houses Without Doors". It blends and fuses two disparate literary forms: a self congratulatory travel brochure published by a city's Chamber of Commerce and a news report about the murderous killing spree of the "viaduct killer."
Plot summary.
The omniscient narrator moves through the seemingly idyllic Midwestern town relating the, surprisingly violent, histories of the various sociological groups that populate the metropolis. He speaks as both a representative of the city, definitively summing up the collective views on life of all, and as a biased observer, subtly commenting on those views. In an indictment on small town life, he points out the city's arrogant insularity and refusal to acknowledge the darker elements of the past. While so doing, he also describes the details of and the resulting city wide interest arising from the "viaduct killer's" murders.
In examining the subsections of the city folk, the identity of the killer is hinted at repeatedly. The affluent are a secretive caste laden down with rituals and untold power, subtly afflicted by inbreeding both literal and figurative. The Eastern Europeans have tightly focused households all routinely verging on the precipice of domestic violence or self mutilation. Feral children, organized into warring tribes after abandonment by social services, live in ramshackle tree house like structures constructed from garbage and prey on tourists. And finally those who dwell in the ghetto, the city has purposefully remained ignorant of them. Each group and several smaller groups all have evidence brought forth that could solidify each one as the breeding ground for the much sought after sociopath but the culprit's cultural identity remains unresolved. The final lingering image is of the half completed bridge, "the Broken Span," the iconic symbol of the city.
Major Themes.
The "Broken Span" is representative of the gulf between reality and perception in the minds of the citizens and the desire for closure. Their myriad violent outbursts is, as described by the text, a pathway towards that closure. Patricia Moir agrees with this symbolic framework and sees this as a recurring element in all of author Peter Straub's fiction. She describes the central issue as individuals or societies "perhaps understandably, construct barriers of denial to protect themselves from knowledge they do no wish to possess" yet those "who do not confront their invisible realities and somehow integrate them into their lives are doomed to remain forever incomplete." And "in the experience of violence there lies knowledge essential to an understanding of their failures, their fears, their hopes, and most important of all, of the universal fact of their mortality. The secrets of the invisible world must be uncovered, communicated, examined, and acted upon if life as a whole is to have any honest validity."
"A Short Guide to the City" is firmly rooted in the Gothic literature tradition. It goes to extreme lengths to establish the atmosphere, discarding any attempt at a traditional narrative in lieu of overwhelming details about the makeup of the city. The city's discarded buildings, much like the abandoned ghostly castles of yore, give rise to a diversity of emotions inherent in the downfall of man made structures. The arcane and violent rituals of the townsmen also give off a Gothic air, in the past reserved for religious or pagan spectacles. Perhaps more than any other element, the story's fascination with darker elements of the past and their effect on the current events is what steadily places "Guide" in the Gothic tradition.
Critical response.
In the realm of pure literary review, New York Times book critic Walter Kendrick described the piece as "Houses Without Doors"' "most chilling story" and "its most blatantly artistic one" while fellow New York Times critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt found it "a shade too vague and portentous to absorb the reader completely."

Symphony No. 27 (Haydn)

Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 27 in G major (Hoboken I/27) was probably written before 1760. Its chronological position was assigned by Eusebius Mandyczewski in 1907. Although later adopted by Hoboken, Robbins Landon has subsequently revised the work's likely chronological position and now believes that the symphony is one of Haydn's earliest, written at roughly the same time as symphonies nos. 15–18. Haydn himself may have labeled the symphony his 16th, although this remains unclear.
Nickname (Hermannstädter).
In 1946, a copy of the symphony was discovered in the summer palace of Baron Samuel von Brukenthal near the city of Hermannstadt (now Sibiu in Romania). Originally thought to be an original discovery, the symphony briefly acquired the nickname "Hermannstädter" after it was recorded under that title by the Romanian Philharmonic State Orchestra. Because of the political climate in Eastern Europe following the Second World War, it was some time before musicologists were able to examine the find and realize that the manuscript was a copy of a work that had already been published by Breitkopf & Hartel in 1907.
Movements.
Manuscript evidence suggests this work was originally scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, strings and continuo. horns were subsequently added to the score, probably by Haydn himself. The work is in three movements:
Despite the small forces at Haydn's disposal, the symphonic expression is broad and vigorous. The main theme of the opening movement hints at the Mannheim Rocket, although in abbreviated fashion. The second hybrid subject employs a developmental device quite common in Haydn's early works. It starts in the dominant major but concludes in the dominant minor, setting up a bright contrast with the closing refrain of the exposition. 
The second movement is a lilting 6/8 siciliano played on muted strings and without winds or horns. Robbins Landon describes the movement "as Italian an andante as was ever composed in Naples or Palermo". There is nothing particularly Italianate in its style. The symphony concludes with a bright, upbeat and brief finale that, like many of his other early works, is developmentally straightforward.

Gabrielle de Coignard

Gabrielle de Coignard (1550–1586) was a French poet, born in Toulouse, France, to John de Coignard and Louise de Baulac. She married a prominent statesman, Pierre de Manescal, in 1570, and was widowed three years later, with two young daughters, Jeanne and Catherine. She turned to writing spiritual verse to help her spiritual and physical struggles.
Eight years after her death (1594), her daughters decided to publish her poems under the title "Œuvres chrestiennes". The poems in this volume include 129 "spiritual sonnets," as well as other poems of varying length, including a long poem on the triumph of the deuterocanonical heroine Judith. Catholic spirituality is the focus of Coignard's work, as it is in the work of her contemporary, Anne de Marquets, who wrote on many of the same subjects.

Symphony No. 28 (Haydn)

Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 28 in A major, Hoboken I/28, was written in 1765.
The work is scored for 2 oboes, bassoon, 2 horns, and strings with continuo.
The work is in four movements:
The inspiring and unusual first movement features a four-note motif with an answering 3-note one. This sounds dry but in Haydn's masterly hands the result is totally exhilarating.
The slow movement features muted strings and contrasts sorrowful legato passages with dotted staccato sections that looks forward to the slow movements of symphonies 60 and 65 where the juxtaposition of the two styles is more stark.
The minuet features bariolage where the same note is heard repeated on different strings, an effect that would later give "The Frog" String Quartet, Op. 50 No. 6, its nickname.
One critic in Leipzig strongly disliked this symphony, complaining mostly about the finale.

Symphony No. 29 (Haydn)

Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 29 in E major, Hoboken I/29, was written in 1765.
The work is scored for two oboes, bassoon, two horns, and strings with continuo.
The work is in four movements:
In the slow movement, the melody is passed back and forth between the first and second violin parts.
The trio of the Minuet has an "oompah accompaniment in the strings" and horns sustaining E's in octaves, but apparently no melody. The harpsichordist would have to provide a melody, but "no keyboard player has dared to provide such a thing for a quarter of a century" between Loibner's recording and the writing of Hodgson's book. H. C. Robbins Landon also notes the "weird atmosphere" and lack of melody, but says it has a "sombre and secretive beauty" and has a "strongly Balkan" character due to an E minor to B minor modulation.
Discography.
In the LP era, neither Antal Doráti with the Philharmonia Hungarica nor Leslie Jones with the Little Orchestra of London provide a tune for the trio of the Minuet. Loibner has the Vienna Academy Chamber Orchestra's harpsichordist Christa Fuhrmann give "the outline of a melody—a convincing example of improvisation which suits the music well."
Moving on to the CD era, on Naxos Records, Nicholas Ward and the Northern Chamber Orchestra pair No. 29 with No.s 22 and 60. Ward's recording has no tune in the trio of the minuet.

Patrick Painter (born Patrick Lee Painter, April 27, 1954, Long Beach, California), is an Irish-American art dealer who runs Patrick Painter Inc., which includes two art galleries in Santa Monica's Bergamot Station; he also owns Patrick Painter Editions. 
Painter was mentored by art dealer Leo Castelli and curator Walter Hopps. In 1991, he began Patrick Painter Editions in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and Hong Kong, with his first edition (of three) being two prints by Roy Arden. The next year, he made editions for Richard Prince, Larry Johnson, and Jeff Wall, among others. Since its inception, Patrick Painter Editions has made small editions of works by John Baldessari, Mike Kelley, Ed Ruscha, Paul McCarthy, Anish Kapoor, Peter Doig, Richard Hawkins, Glenn Brown, Andrea Zittel, Christopher Wool, Collier Schorr, Harmony Korine, Douglas Huebler, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Art & Language and John Miller to name a few. Although Patrick Painter Editions was established in a depressed market, he managed to build his business upon the success he had turning editions. Fine art prints, or multiple editions, were looked down upon at the time by many critics and collectors; Painter created a unique approach to the market. In 1996, 20 galleries worldwide had shows of exclusively Patrick Painter Editions. 
Painter opened Patrick Painter Inc., an art gallery in Santa Monica, CA, in 1997 with the backing and support of Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy, while continuing to maintain his fine art editions activities. Today, Patrick Painter Inc. represents and shows work by an international roster of emerging and mid-career artists including Georg Baselitz, Tim Berresheim, Simon Bill, Glenn Brown, André Butzer, Liz Craft, Valie Export, Bernard Frize, Francesca Gabbiani, Salomón Huerta, Jörg Immendorff, Larry Johnson, Mike Kelley, Won Ju Lim, John Miller, John Newsom, Albert Oehlen, Philippe Pasqua, Peter Saul, Mattias Schaufler, Christoph Schmidberger, Jim Shaw, Melanie Smith, Meyer Vaisman, Marnie Weber, Toby Ziegler, and Thomas Zipp, as well as the estate of Bas Jan Ader.

Veillantif

Veillantif (French), Vegliantin, Vegliantino or Brigliadoro (Italian) is the name of Roland the paladin's trustworthy and swift horse in the stories derived from the "chansons de geste". The French name comes from an expression meaning "vigilant". "Veillantif" is first mentioned in the "Song of Roland" (v2032; laisse 151). 
The Italian name "Vegliantino" was initially used in the Italian romances (he is found as such in Luigi Pulci's "Morgante"), but Matteo Maria Boiardo renamed him "Brigliadoro" in his "Orlando Innamorato", and this is the name that is also used in Ludovico Ariosto's "Orlando Furioso".
Veillantif was given various origins. In the 12th century "chanson de geste" "Aspremont", he is said to have formerly been the possession of king Agolant's son Helmont. After Helmont's defeat, the horse (and his sword Durendal) was given to Roland. This was the tradition followed by Boiardo and Ariosto.

Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command

The Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (COMNAVMETOCCOM) or NMOC, serves as the operational arm of the Naval Oceanography Program. Headquartered at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, NMOC is a third echelon command reporting to United States Fleet Forces Command (USFLTFORCOM). CNMOC's claimancy is globally distributed, with assets located on larger ships (aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, and command and control ships), shore facilities at fleet concentration areas, and larger production centers in the U.S.
NMOC is focused on providing critical environmental knowledge to the warfighting disciplines of Anti-Submarine Warfare; Naval Special Warfare; Mine Warfare; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; and Fleet Operations (Strike and Expeditionary), as well as to the support areas of Maritime Operations, Aviation Operations, Navigation, Precise Time, and Astrometry.
The Oceanographer of the Navy works closely with the staff of NMOC to ensure the proper resources are available to meet its mission, to act as a liaison between NMOC and the Chief of Naval Operations, and to represent the Naval Oceanography Program in interagency and international forums.
Mission.
Responsible for command and management of the Naval Oceanography Program, utilizing meteorology and oceanography, GI&S, and precise time and astrometry, to leverage the environment to enable successful strategic, tactical and operational battle space utilization across the continuum of campaigning and at all levels of war – strategic, operational and tactical.
History.
The Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command traces its ancestry to the Depot of Charts and Instruments, a 19th-century repository for nautical charts and navigational equipment. In the 1840s, its superintendent, Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury, created and published a revolutionary series of wind and current charts. This information, still resident in modern computer models of Ocean basins and the atmosphere, laid the foundation for the sciences of oceanography and meteorology.
Atmospheric science was further developed with the birth of naval aviation early in the twentieth century. During World War I and the following decades, naval aerological specialists applied the fledgling concepts of air masses and fronts to warfare and provided forecasts to the first transatlantic flight.
The Navy's weather and ocean programs contributed greatly to Allied victory in World War II. In the Pacific, Navy forecasters cracked the Japanese weather code. Hydrographic survey ships, often under enemy fire, collected data along foreign coastlines for the creation of critical navigation charts.
In the mid-1970s, the Navy's meteorology and oceanography programs were integrated in a single organization reflecting nature's close interaction of sea and air. This structure is today the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command.
Organization.
Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command is a third echelon operational command reporting to Fleet Forces Command. The Command's personnel are located at its headquarters at the John C. Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and at several field activities located around the world.
The Command's major subordinate activities include the Naval Oceanographic Office, located at Stennis Space Center Mississippi; Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, located in Monterey, California; the Naval Observatory, located in Washington, D.C.; the Naval Oceanography Operations Command, located at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi; and the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Professional Development Center located in Gulfport, Mississippi.
The Command is aligned to and focused on five of the Navy's warfighting disciplinesAnti-Submarine Warfare; Special Warfare; Mine Warfare; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; and Fleet Operations (Strike and Expeditionary)-- as well as the following warfighting support disciplines: Navigation, Precise Time and Astrometry, Maritime Operations and Aviation Operations.

Henry Whitehead Moss

Henry Whitehead Moss (23 June 1841-14 January 1917) was an English scholar.
Moss was born at Lincoln. He was educated at Lincoln Grammar School and Shrewsbury before entering St. John's College, Cambridge, where he held a scholarship, in 1860. In 1862, two years after his arrival, he was elected the Craven University scholar, and in 1864 he gained his BA as Senior Classic and was appointed a Fellow and Lecturer of St. John's. He was ordained a Church of England priest in 1866 and graduated M.A. in 1867.
In 1866, Benjamin Hall Kennedy resigned the headmastership of Shrewsbury School, and at the age of 25, Moss was chosen to succeed him; he remained in the post for forty-two years, until he retired in 1908. Whilst headmaster, he supervised the movement of the school from its town centre site to a new location, at Kingsland, on the outskirts of the town in 1882. 
Among many improvements he made in the life of the school at its new location was to present the school with a swimming bath as a personal gift and to purchase additional land to expand the playing fields, re-establish speech days and the school's cadet rifle corps, and make better provision for teaching mathematics, modern languages and natural sciences. He also introduced 'Merit Halves' - a half-day holiday as reward for academic achievement, punctuality in attending school chapel, and a minimal number of punishments.
He was Chairman of the Headmasters' Conference from 1899 to 1902.
Moss was also a Prebendary of Hereford Cathedral from 1887 until his death at Highfield Park near Oxford in 1917, aged 75. He was buried in Shrewsbury at the General Cemetery in Longden Road; ironically, while in process of choosing a new site for the move of Shrewsbury School, he had rejected an adjacent field after seeing at least six funerals arrive.

Silver claret jug

A silver claret jug is a wine jug made of glass and silver for the so-called claret, which is a French Bordeaux wine. 
Claret jugs were produced from about 1830 to 1920 and are nowadays very collectible. The majority were made of cut (sometimes frosted) glass. The silver mounted tops incorporated hinged lids, and handles that extended down halfway or to the base. The mounts were often engraved or chased, and the glass bodies were found in many different shapes and varying ornamentation. Some earlier examples were made entirely of silver. The level of craftsmanship and their aesthetic qualities determine their value. Unusual jugs, such as those made by Charles Edwards or Christopher Dresser, or examples with fine engraved scenes, may command high prices.
History.
In the 18th century there flourished a wide production of silver mounted cruet stand bottles. They were sized from 15–18 cm, but no taller or larger bottle suitable to serve wine was manufactured. The first examples of "wine" bottles were made in the 1830s and among the first were those manufactured in London by Reilly & Storer.
Although glass was used for drinking vessels since the earliest times, only the 19th century saw the development of the claret jug. Silversmiths began "modifying" glass decanters used in the 18th century by adding simple bands of silver and replacing glass stoppers with silver hinged lids. In the second quarter of the century, silver handles and larger mounts were added, although in most cases the glass maintained a "bottle" shape and restrained design. 
From the middle of the century, old rules were abandoned and claret jugs became one of the preferred methods for artists to display their skill on the production of fabulous and often bizarre designs. Claret Jugs were produced throughout Europe and, although France had a large production of fine silver and glass jugs, most of the diverse and often beautiful designs are of British manufacture.
British claret jugs have a wonderful glass body and perfect silver decorated mounting, as do the Russian pieces, especially those made by Gratchev or Fabergé. French manufacturers, perhaps as a consequence of the great tradition existing in wine production in their country, displayed creations characterized by highly functional shapes. The British silversmiths, less conditioned by the "culture" of wine, demonstrated broader creativity, stronger innovation and frivolous attitudes in their manufacture.
Since the 1850s, many of the leading British manufacturers were producing fabulous hand engraved glass bodies. As many of their factories were located in the north of the country, the majority of their silver mounts were hallmarked in Birmingham and Sheffield assay offices. As the European Grand Tour was in great fashion among the wealthy minority, the demand for more fanciful models grew and designers researched their inspiration in the styles found in Europe; from geometric Grecian patterns to classical scenes in the Romantic style of contemporary French painters.
By the third quarter of the century, jugs of the most bizarre form were in great fashion and in many cases the glass bore little resemblance to the early "bottles". The mounts were often chased in perfect symmetry to the glass. Curiously, this was also the period characterized by some of the most delicate items and several prominent silversmiths created rare and unusual jugs in naturalistic form. Flowers, such as roses, crocuses and water lilies, were copied perfectly to silver mounts and glass decoration which then were assembled to perfection. From 1875 the forerunners of the Art Nouveau period were experimenting with the re-discovered Japanese art and the Aesthetic period became hugely popular. In Germany and Austria the Art Nouveau period lead to the production of claret jugs with wonderfully decorated glass body but also, and often, to plain body artifacts.
For artists, claret jugs became a medium to reproduce the delicate forms used for centuries in the Far East. Butterflies, birds, plants, and flowers became a common engraving, often with the addition of other small subjects in Japanese taste (a delicately engraved fan was often added amidst birds and foliage). The 1880s saw the start of the manufacture of the rarest jugs even produced, in the form of animals, birds and fishes. These were made in very limited quantity and by few silversmiths, presumably because they required the highest craftsmanship for their manufacture. The most stunning of these forms had the glass realistically cut and engraved to simulate the texture of the model in minute and intricate details (feathers of a duck or the hair of a monkey). Many unusual, unconventional and extravagant examples are in the collection of Richard Kent.
At the end of the 19th century the production of these beautiful objects ceased for a variety of reasons. The vivacious market of exotic Victoriana was replaced by the austerity of the Edwardian period, and this, coupled with the high cost of producing fine glassware, marked the end of 75 years of fine design and beauty. From the 1920s no more remarkable claret jugs were produced.

Megan Neyer

Megan Neyer (born June 11, 1962) is an American former competition springboard and platform diver. Neyer was a member of the ill-fated 1980 U.S. Olympic team, the 1982 world champion springboard diver, a fifteen-time U.S. national diving champion, and an eight-time NCAA champion.
Early years.
Neyer was born in Ashland, Kentucky in 1962, but moved to Mission Viejo, California to further her athletic training.
Diving career.
Neyer won the United States Olympic trials in both springboard and platform diving in 1980, but did not participate in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the American-led boycott arising from the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.
Neyer received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she competed in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition as a member of coach Randy Reese's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1986. As a freshman in 1982, she was a member of the Gator women's NCAA championship team that included swimmers Theresa Andrews, Amy Caulkins, Tracy Caulkins and Kathy Treible, and won her first two individual NCAA championships in the women's one-meter and three-meter springboard events. In August 1982, four months after her first NCAA championships, Neyer won the gold medal in the women's springboard competition at the World Aquatics Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
Individually, Neyer won an unprecedented eight NCAA diving championships, sweeping the one-meter and three-meter springboard events in all four years of college diving, and was recognized as an All-American eight times. In July 1984, she placed third in the U.S. Olympic Trials and failed to make the U.S. Olympic team, which came as a crushing emotional blow to her. After the Olympic trials, she took eighteen months off from competitive diving. She returned to the University of Florida for her senior season in 1986, winning the NCAA championships in the one-meter and three-meter springboard events again. She was also recognized as an Academic All-American in 1983 and 1986, and graduated from Florida with a 3.5 cumulative gradepoint average and a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1986. She remains the all-time winningest collegiate diver, male or female, in NCAA history.
Between 1981 and 1988, Neyer won fifteen national springboard diving championships—eight outdoor events and seven in the indoor events. In 1987, she won the U.S. national championship in the indoor three-meter springboard event and the outdoor one-meter springboard, and the springboard silver medal in the Pan American Games. She won her fifteenth and final U.S. national championship in 1988, and retired from competition diving following the 1988 Olympic Trials after failing to qualify for the U.S. Olympic Team.
Neyer was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a "Gator Great" in 1996, and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2006, she was named the NCAA's Most Outstanding Diver of the Last Quarter Century.
Life after diving.
In a June 1988 "New York Times" article, she openly discussed her private battle with bulimia from 1981 to 1984. After she retired from competitive diving in 1988, Neyer returned to graduate school at the University of Florida on an NCAA post-graduate scholarship to complete her master's degree in sports psychology in 1990 and her doctorate in counseling in 1994. Neyer was honored as a University of Florida Alumna of Outstanding Achievement in 1997, and was formerly the director of performance and wellness counseling at the Homer Rice Center for Sports Performance at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia. She currently is the principal of Total Performance Systems, Inc., and works as a performance counselor for elite athletes and business executives in Atlanta.

<doc id="18851752" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18851752" title="Llanishen Reservoir">
Llanishen Reservoir

Llanishen Reservoir () is a Victorian reservoir in North Cardiff in South Wales. The reservoir is one of the reservoirs constructed as part of the Taff Fawr scheme for supplying water to Cardiff and was completed in 1886. It forms part of the Nant Fawr Corridor from the top of Roath Park to the countryside beyond Cyncoed.
The reservoir was used for water supply until the mid-1970s when it became redundant. It was then used for leisure activities and for 'topping up' the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir until it was drained completely. After buying Hyder plc, its new owner Western Power Distribution (WPD), proposed to redevelop the reservoir site, but after a series of objections from national governing bodies, the County Council, local residents and both local and national politicians this was blocked. On 30 August 2013 WPD sold both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs to CELSA Group.
History.
In 1881, a report was commissioned on water resources within a reasonable distance of Cardiff. The report concluded that the Taff Fawr scheme would fulfil the town's requirements at the least cost and it was decided to create Llanishen Reservoir. Construction of the reservoir started in 1882 by the engineer James Simpson for the Cardiff Waterworks Company and was completed in 1886.
The reservoir is retained by an earth-filled embankment with a clay core some high and about long. The external embankment face is grassed whilst the internal face has stone pitching over the upper part and concrete over the lower part. It has a maximum surface area of water of and a capacity of .
The reservoir is underlain by the St Maughan's Formation of the Lower Devonian age. Glacial till deposits of the Devonian age form part of the northern shore of the reservoir. The reservoir may be on the northern limb of the Cowbridge anticline.
The reservoir was transferred to Welsh Water in 1973 when the Welsh Water Authority was formed, and it supplied water until the mid-1970s. In 1996 Welsh Water's holding company was renamed as Hyder plc and the group acquired South Wales Electricity plc. After Hyder's share price collapsed in 1999 and 2000, the Hyder Group was sold to WPD on terms recommended by the Hyder Board after a competitive and hostile takeover battle. WPD is the American-owned electricity distribution network operator for South West England and South and West Wales.
Welsh Assembly members were concerned that the takeover would mean jobs being transferred to Bristol and Cheshire, and at its effect "on consumers' interests, on the environment, and on the wider economy".
WPD acquired the reservoir from Welsh Water in 2001 when Welsh Water was acquired by the not-for-profit organisation Glas Cymru: the reservoir was sold to a WPD subsidiary, Hyder Industrial Group Ltd, which was later renamed Western Power Distribution Investments Ltd.
The reservoir, which forms part of the Nant Fawr corridor, has been redundant since the 1970s and has only been used for leisure purposes and for 'topping up' the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir.
Protection.
The reservoir is listed as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) as it has pondweed and stonewort, and common toads breed there. The grassland and scrub surrounding the reservoir is also an SNCI due to the grass snakes and slow-worms there.
The banks of the reservoir are listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of waxcap fungi discovered growing on them. WPD appealed against this listing stating the Countryside Council for Wales's (CCW) decision was 'premature, arbirtrary and unfair', but in January 2007 a High Court Judge upheld the SSSI designation and said it was 'an important site'.
The reservoir was also listed by Cadw in July 2009 as a building of special architectural or historic interest, despite an appeal from WPD against the listing.
Leisure.
Until Spring 2010, Cardiff Sailing Centre operated at the reservoir offering dinghy sailing, windsurfing, powerboating and canoeing courses. The centre, which is owned and managed by Cardiff County Council had been running at the reservoir for 30 years, though had to relocate to Cardiff Bay to continue operating due to the drain-down.
The Centre has gained national recognition as both a 'grass-roots' training centre through the RYA's OnBoard scheme and as a first class race training centre & club. The Centre has also produced National & International class sailors over the years.
The reservoir was also once popular with anglers (through the Cardiff Fly Fishing Club), picnickers, birdwatchers and walkers. Fishing at the reservoir stopped in 1998 and many of the other activities have been curtailed since 2004 due to the security fence that was constructed around the banks of the reservoir and (less securely) to the site boundary.
Many people still walk between the 'inner' and 'outer' fences, due to a number of natural and man-made gaps in the outer fence and the natural hedges. Although the site is monitored, only some of the 'gaps' are resecured.
Proposed redevelopment.
WPD have proposed redevelopment since 2002. The latest proposal is for 300 new homes, surrounding a much reduced water area, and a connected 'wetland area', as well as a new sailing club and wildlife and education centre. This proposal was recommended by the Planning Inspector, but rejected by the Environment Minister. WPD requested a judicial review of the decision and the minister withdrew her defence after considering WPD's submission. The Court referred the decision back to the minister and a decision is awaited.
In March 2010, work started to drain the legal limit of of water from the reservoir into the nearby Nant Fawr stream. WPD say that the drain-down is required as a result of a statutory inspection carried out by WS Atkins PLC. But the Environment Agency have disagreed. The drainage is opposed by opponents of the redevelopment, who claim that the reservoir will take 8 years to refill if totally emptied.
The public enquiry considered the requirement for drain-down and the ecological effects in detail. On the drain-down the Planning Inspector concluded that opponents' suspicions had been "fully rebutted". And after considering a lot of evidence the Inspector concluded that CCW were content for development to proceed and that "significant ecological benefits would result from the development".
In May 2010, WPD applied to the Environment Agency for a discharge licence in order to completely drain the reservoir, which was granted in July 2010. The issue was taken to UK Parliament by Jonathan Evans where he stated that an independent report by the Halcrow Group (advising for the Environment Agency) explained that draining the reservoir could create 'new risks to reservoir safety'. Evans' predecessor, Julie Morgan, had previously taken the issue of saving the reservoir site to parliament, and had garnered support from politicians such as Peter Hain (the Welsh Secretary) and Ed Miliband (later leader of the Labour Party), who visited the site during the May 2010 general election campaign, commenting on the site's tranquillity.
In March 2011, WPD applied to Cardiff County Council for planning permission for a miniroundabout on Lisvane Road and listed building consent to alter the structure of the reservoir. Both of these were called in by the Welsh Government. During the appeal a number of changes to the original appeal were submitted by WPD and accepted by all parties. The appeal was heard during the Summer of 2011.
On 25 April 2013, The Welsh Government refused the planning appeal from WPD which was for 324 homes.
On 30 August 2013, CELSA Group bought both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs from their owner Western Power Distribution, to assure its Cardiff rod mill plant a consistent supply of water from Lisvane.

Mystic Dam

The Mystic Dam (and its gatehouse) are a historic dam and gatehouse between Lower and Upper Mystic Lakes in the suburbs north of Boston, Massachusetts. The was built in 1864-5 by the Charlestown Water Commission (Charlestown then being separate from Boston) as part of a water supply system. It was located at a narrow point between the Lower and Upper Mystic Lakes, with its west end in Arlington and its east end in Medford. The water system it was a part of eventually merged into the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC), predecessor to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR).
As built, the dam was over long and high, with most of that length (about ) consisting of earthen embankments lined with riprap and puddle clay. Near its center is a spillway area consisting of a series of square columns constructed of granite blocks and a masonry apron. These columns are grooved on their inner faces to facilitate the installation of stop logs. A wooden walkway with a plank railing ran across the top of the dam. A wooden fish ladder was built, but removed at a later date. A gatehouse on the Medford side was used to connect the upper lake to a brick-lined aqueduct that delivered the water to Charlestown. The lake area impounded by the dam is .
The dam and gatehouse were each listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. By the early 2000s, the dam was known to not be in very good condition, with failing spillway masonry, erosion, and other damage to the dam's stonework. A major storm in 2006 flooded portions of the surrounding area, and highlighted the potential inability of the dam to handle a significant high-water event, leading to catastrophic flooding of downstream areas. Between 2010 and 2012 major work was undertaken to improve the dam's condition. A new spillway was constructed to the east of the old spillway, which received a new spillway apron. Work was done on the embankments and the shores near the upper areas of the dam, and a new fish ladder and bridge were built. The historic gatehouse was also rehabilitated, and modern controls were added, enabling improved control over the water levels behind the dam.

USS Matagorda (AVP-22)

USS "Matagorda" (AVP-22/AG-122) was a United States Navy "Barnegat"-class seaplane tender in commission from 1941 to 1946.
Construction, commissioning, and shakedown.
"Matagorda" (AVP 22) was laid down by Boston Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts, on 6 September 1940. She was launched on 18 March 1941, sponsored by Miss Nancy Rowland Brand, and commissioned at Boston on 16 December 1941 with Commander Stanley J. Michael in command.
"Matagorda" remained at Boston until 3 April 1942, when she departed for shakedown and training in Chesapeake Bay. She returned to Boston on 22 April 1942.
World War II service.
Operations in the Galápagos Islands, Panama Canal Zone, and Caribbean.
After returning to Boston, "Matagorda" joined Patrol Wings Atlantic (PatWingLant) and loaded torpedoes and ordnance stores at Newport, Rhode Island. On 12 May 1942 she departed Newport and moved to Seymour Island in the Galápagos Islands. Arriving there on 25 May 1942, she relieved seaplane tender USS "Osmond Ingram" (AVD-2) and began tending seaplanes of Patrol Wing 3 (PatWing 3).
After these duties ended, "Matagorda" arrived at Coco Solo in the Panama Canal Zone on 20 June 1942. She escorted merchant ships to Cuba and Jamaica before resuming seaplane tending duty on 22 July 1942, this time from bases in Central America and South America: She operated out of Puerto Castilla, Honduras, and Cartagena, Colombia until returning to the Panama Canal Zone on 12 November 1942.
Following a supply and escort run to Puerto Rico and Trinidad, "Matagorda" departed Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 23 November 1942 and on 4 December 1942 arrived at Boston for alterations and overhaul.
Voyage to Newfoundland.
on 5 January 1943, "Matagorda" departed Boston to carry troops and supplies to Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, returning to Boston on 14 January 1943.
Return to the Caribbean.
After loading aviation supplies at Norfolk, Virginia, "Matagorda" arrived at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 11 February 1943. She operated primarily out of Puerto Rico until early August 1943, escorting merchant ships and transporting ordnance and aviation supplies to bases in the Caribbean. She called at the Virgin Islands, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Trinidad.
North Atlantic operations.
"Matagorda" departed San Juan on 3 August 1943 and steamed via Bermuda and Norfolk to Argentia, where she arrived on 26 August 1943. On 28 August 1943 she joined Convoy UT-1 and made a voyage to the United Kingdom, arriving at Pembroke, Wales, on 4 September 1943. After unloading cargo, she sailed via Iceland and Boston to Norfolk, arriving there on 27 September 1943. Between 5 October 1943 and 5 March 1944 she made two more round trips across the Atlantic Ocean. She carried men and cargo to Pembroke and Bristol, England, and made escort and supply runs to Casablanca, French Morocco, and Gibraltar.
South Atlantic operations.
Departing Boston on 18 April 1944, "Matagorda" loaded seaplane supplies at Bayonne, New Jersey, and departed Bayonne on 22 April 1944 for Brazil, reaching Recife, Brazil, on 6 May 1944. Until the beginning of April 1945, she conducted extensive training and supply operations and ranged Brazilian waters from Belém to Florianópolis. In late May 1944 and again in July 1944 she tended seaplanes at Florianópolis.
"Matagorda" interrupted this duty on 24 July 1944 and 25 July 1944, when she searched for and rescued the entire crew of 67 men from the American merchant ship SS "William Gaston", torpedoed by a German submarine late on 23 July 1944 off the Brazilian coast. Again, while operating out of Fortaleza, she rescued five survivors of a downed Consolidated PBY-5 Catalina flying boat plus the crew from an assisting Martin PBM Mariner flying boat on 29 August 1944.
"Matagorda" made numerous runs along the Brazilian coast during supply and training missions. Based at Recife, she visited many Brazilian ports including Vitória, Natal, the island of Fernando de Noronha, Bahia, and Rio de Janeiro.
Voyages to the Caribbean.
"Matagorda" departed Recife on 1 April 1945, touched briefly at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and reached Norfolk on 14 April 1945. From 2 June 1945 to 6 July 1945 she made two runs to Bermuda and Puerto Rico, returning to Norfolk with men of seaplane squadrons.
Conversion to press information ship.
"Matagorda" steamed to New York City on 10 July 1945 to begin conversion to a press information ship. As such her mission would be to provide all proper news facilities for the press and transport them to the coast of Japan where they would cover operations “Olympic” and “Coronet”, projected for the invasion of Japan in 1945 and 1946. She was reclassified as a "miscellaneous auxiliary" and redesignated AG-122 on 30 July 1945.
The cessation of hostilities with Japan and end of World War II came on 15 August 1945 made the invasion of Japan unnecessary, and "Matagorda"s conversion was halted in early September 1945.
Post-World War II U.S. Navy service.
Converted back into a seaplane tender and once again designated AVP-22 as of 10 September 1945, "Matagorda" departed New York City for Norfolk on 17 October 1945. On 31 October 1945 she departed Norfolk for Orange, Texas. Arriving there on 5 November 1945 for inactivation, she was decommissioned on 20 February 1946 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleets Texas Group at Orange.
United States Coast Guard service.
"Matagorda" was loaned to the United States Coast Guard on 7 March 1949 and commissioned on 8 June 1949 as the Coast Guard cutter USCGC "Matagorda" (WAVP-373). Reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-373 on 1 May 1966, her primary duty was to patrol ocean stations in the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, providing weather-reporting services and engaging in search-and-rescue and law-enforcement operations.
Decommissioned in October 1967, "Matagorda" was returned to the U.S. Navy in October 1968 and sunk as a target off Hawaii in October 1969.

<doc id="18851925" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18851925" title="Vilazodone">
Vilazodone

Vilazodone (United States trade name Viibryd) is a serotonergic antidepressant developed by Clinical Data for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The chemical compound was originally developed by Merck KGaA (Germany).
By 2009 two phase III clinical trials with positive results had been completed. Vilazodone was approved by the FDA for use in the United States to treat major depressive disorder on January 21, 2011. Vilazodone is also prescribed as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder.
Medical uses.
Major Depressive Disorder.
According to two eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults, vilazodone was reported to elicit an antidepressant response after one week of treatment. After eight weeks, subjects assigned to vilazodone 40mg daily dose (titrated over 2 weeks) experienced a significantly higher response rate than the group given placebo (44% vs 30%, P = .002). Remission rates for vilazodone were not significantly different versus placebo. 
According to an article on the the United States approval of Vilazodone written by FDA staff, "it is unknown whether has any advantages compared to other drugs in the antidepressant class."
Adverse effects.
After a one-year, open-label study assessing the safety and tolerability of vilazodone in patients with major depressive disorder, the most common adverse effects were diarrhea (35.7%), nausea (31.6%), and headache (20.0%); greater than 90% of these adverse effects were mild or moderate. In contrast to other SSRIs currently on the market, initial clinical trials showed that vilazodone did not cause significant decreased sexual desire/function as with many other antidepressants, which often cause people to abandon their use.
Incidence of adverse effects.
Sources:
Overdose.
Adverse reactions of VIIBRYD at doses of 200-280 mg included serotonin syndrome, lethargy, restlessness, hallucinations, and disorientation.
Pharmacology.
Vilazodone acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = 2.1 nM; Ki = 0.1 nM) and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist (IC50 = 0.2 nM; IA = ~60–70%). It has negligible affinity for other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C. 
It also exhibits negligible inhibitory activity at the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (IC50 = 56 nM for NET and 37 nM for DAT).
Partial agonism of the 5-HT1A receptor is a relatively novel mechanism of action and is also shared by the anxiolytic buspirone (Buspar), the atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole (Abilify) and lurasidone (Latuda) ,and the novel antidepressant vortioxetine (Brintellix).
Pharmacokinetics.
Vilazodone is prescribed for major depressive disorder in doses ranging from 10 mg to 40 mg daily. Its half-life is approximately 25 hours.
Ingredients.
Viibryd (US).
Viibryd is available in tablet form as the hydrochloride salt of vilazodone in doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg. Inactive ingredients include lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, talc, and various FD&C colorings (Blue #1, Yellow #6, Red #40) depending on the dose.

<doc id="18851958" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18851958" title="Richard Gunnell">
Richard Gunnell

Richard Gunnell (fl. 1613 – 1634) was an actor, playwright, and theatre manager in Jacobean and Caroline era London. He is best remembered for his role in the founding of the Salisbury Court Theatre.
Actor and playwright.
Nothing is known of Gunnell's early life or the first phase of his stage career. He acted with the Admiral's Men, then called the Palsgrave's Men, from 1613 to 1622. When the Palsgrave's Men received their renewed charter and their new name on 4 January 1613, Gunnell was already a sharer in the company. Despite the scantiness of the documentary record for the Palsgrave's troupe, Gunnell can be seen moving up into a managerial responsibility over his years with the company. In the 1613 charter he is listed twelfth of the fourteen sharers. On the company's 1618 lease of the Fortune Playhouse from owner Edward Alleyn, Gunnell is fourth of ten. And when the company leased the rebuilt Fortune in 1622, Gunnell is listed first.
The fire that destroyed the Fortune on 9 December 1621 also wiped out the costumes and play manuscripts of the Palsgrave's Men. In the difficult period that followed, Gunnell appears to have left acting to concentrate of management. He also made a venture at writing plays. His comedy "The Hungarian Lion" appeared in 1623, and his "The Way to Content All Women, or How a Man May Please His Wife" followed in 1624. Neither of his plays has survived.
Salisbury Court.
Gunnell partnered with William Blagrave, Sir Henry Herbert's assistant in the office of the Master of the Revels, to establish the Salisbury Court Theatre in 1629. The Salisbury Court was one of the so-called "private" theatres of the era, comparable to the Blackfriars or the Cockpit, as opposed to the "public" theatres like the Fortune or the Globe that catered to a broad audience. Since the private theatres were prestigious and lucrative – their minimum ticket price was five or six times higher than the public theatres' penny – the move from public to private made business sense, and Gunnell was not the first theatre manager to pursue this course. (Christopher Beeston, manager of the public Red Bull Theatre, built the private Cockpit in 1616–17.)
Along with their new theatre, Gunnell and Blagrave intended to start their own new acting company, called the Children of the Revels. Their plan was to organize a troupe of boy players, comparable to the boys' companies of the previous generation, the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul's. (Christopher Beeston would make the same effort, though more fortunately, when he started Beeston's Boys in 1637.) The Blagrave/Gunnell troupe was not a success, since an outbreak of bubonic plague forced the London theatres to close in 1630 – though Stephen Hammerton, the popular young actor who found fame with the King's Men, emerged from it.
Business difficulties apparently tempted Gunnell to try to sell his theatrical enterprise; but he and the buyer, Christopher Babham, could not agree on terms and soon went to court over their disagreement. Gunnell remained in the theatre, and brought the re-organized Prince Charles's Men (a troupe that included some of his old Palsgrave's compatriots) into the Salisbury Court in 1631.
End.
Gunnell was a longtime resident of the London parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate; the parish records note the christenings and burials of several Gunnell children between 1613 and 1631. He "died late in 1634 or 1635." Gunnell died intestate, leaving a widow, Elizabeth, and two daughters, Margaret and Anne. Elizabeth later married a John Robinson, who may have been the actor of that name; Margaret married actor William Wintershall.

<doc id="18852007" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18852007" title="Bernhard, Count of Anhalt">
Bernhard, Count of Anhalt

Bernhard, Count of Anhalt ( – 2 February 1212) was a German prince of the House of Ascania, Count of Anhalt and Ballenstedt, and Lord of Bernburg through his paternal inheritance. From 1180 he was also Duke of Saxony as Bernhard III or Bernhard I.
Life.
Early years.
Bernhard was the youngest of the seven sons of Albert the Bear, Margrave of Brandenburg and Duke of Saxony, by his wife Sophie of Winzenburg. In 1157 he was present together with his father and brothers at the funeral of Conrad the Great, a member of the House of Wettin and Margrave of Meissen. In 1159, Bernhard accompanied the emperor Frederick I Barbarossa to Italy with his brother Otto. After the death of his father in 1170, Bernhard inherited the states of Anhalt and the district of Ascaria (Aschersleben) as well as the former "Gau Serimunt" between the Saale, Mulde, and Elbe rivers.
After the death of his brother Albert in 1172 without male issue, Bernhard also inherited his County of Ballenstedt. In the same year he solicited the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in the Reichstag of Goslar for possession of Plötzkau, which passed to him in 1173. A dispute over control over the County of Plötzkau led to a war with Henry the Lion that led to the destruction of Aschersleben and Gröningen and nearly resulted in the destruction of Halberstadt. Bernhard nonetheless was able to confirm his possession of Plötzkau.
Fall of Henry the Lion.
When Henry the Lion was outlawed by the Emperor in 1180, the Reichstag also dispossessed him of his fiefs (Würzburg and the Duchies of Bavaria and Saxony). In Gelnhausen on 13 April 1180, Bernhard was granted the eastern part of the Welf lands, including the Archbishopric of Bremen-Hamburg, which was passed on to his elder brother Siegfried, and the Duchy of Saxony. This latter award was without real value, however, since this duchy was a radically reduced territory consisting of three unconnected parcels of land along the river Elbe: (1) Hadeln around Otterndorf, (2) a parcel around Lauenburg upon Elbe and (3) a parcel around Wittenberg upon Elbe. Previously the duchy had been divided, so that Bernhard could only receive the region between Meissen and the Mark of Brandenburg as his formal possession. Besides these, he also received several small territories: the towns of Aken and Wittenberg and the Burgraviate of Magdeburg. The dignity "Duke of Saxony, Angria and Westphalia" was only an empty title. The rich lands of Engern and Westphalia, in addition to the ducal title of Highness, were conferred on the Archbishopric-Electorate of Cologne. The counts of Holstein were released from their homage to the Saxon dukes, the County of Stade was taken by the Archbishop of Bremen, Lübeck became an Imperial City, the Saxon Palatinate was bestowed on Count Hermann of Thuringia and, in addition, the Saxon bishops took back their fiefs. Bernhard was forced to support the Emperor in his renewed war against Henry the Lion in 1181. In spite of his defeat, Henry the Lion was able to preserve his Allodial title, from which the Duchy of Brunswick and Lüneburg was later formed.
Ruling as Duke of Saxony.
In Nordalbingien and the areas between the Elbe and the Baltic Sea, Bernhard's vassals soon rebelled against him and gave their support to Henry the Lion. Bernhard tried to assert his claims, thanks to the support of his brothers Otto I of Brandenburg and Siegfried, Archbishop of Bremen. At first the vassals of Artlenburg swore an oath of fidelity. After them, the counts of Ratzeburg, Danneberg, Luckow and Schwerin also swore. However, the most powerful of these vassals, Count Adolf of Holstein, would not accept the Bernhard's lordship and became his adversary. Conflicts broke out around Dithmarschen, in western Holstein, but without success for Adolf.
After Adolf's defeat, Lauenburg (Polabenburg) on the lower Elbe, became the focal point for opposition to Bernhard's rule. Determined to eliminate the opposition against him in his lands, he levied high taxes on rebellious territories, which led to an attack against Lauenburg and its destruction in 1182, followed by the restoration of the fortress.
In 1183 another of Bernhard's brothers, Count Dietrich of Werben died without surviving male issue. His possessions fell mostly to Bernhard.
Warfare involving Henry the Lion also expanded to the Slavic countries. Henry Borwin I, the son of Pribislav, was a supporter of Henry the Lion like his father, and remained an opponent of Bernhard. His cousin Nicholas I (Niklot), granted Burg Malchow by Henry the Lion in 1164, lost part of it due to his association with Bernhard. Borwin allied himself with Duke Bogislaw I of Pomerania and Nicholas with Prince Jaromir I of Rügen, a faithful vassal of Denmark. But shortly after Bogislaw had to punish Borwin (in response to a secret order of the emperor) with the help of King Canute VI of Denmark for his refusal to render homage, by which his lands were split between the Elbe and Or to the Empire and Denmark. Borwin was taken into captivity by King Canute and was forced, like Nicholas, to accept his lands from the king as fiefs. After incursions of the Danes in Pomerania in 1184 and 1185, Bogislaw shared the same destiny.
With the success of the Danes, the Emperor in 1184 pressed for a political balance between Bernhard and his vassal. Count Adolf of Holstein kept the regions disputed between them, however he had to pay 700 marks to Bernhard and swear the oath of fidelity that he had earlier refused to do. Counts Bernhard of Ratzeburg and Gunzelin of Schwerin were also obliged to make payments. The destroyed Lauenburg had to be rebuilt.
However, after Henry's return in 1188 it came again to discussions with Bernhard, who finally lost the town of Bardowick.
As Duke of Saxony, Bernhard became at the same time Marshal of the Holy Roman empire. He asserted this important post for the first time in 1190 at the coronation of Emperor Henry VI, but spoiled his good terms with the Emperor through his opposition to turning over the hereditary German crown to the House of Hohenstaufen. In 1198 he supported Philipp of Swabia as Emperor. Philipp was killed on 21 June 1208 by Otto of Wittelsbach at Altenburg in Bamberg. Thereupon a new imperial election was held in Halberstadt and (with Bernhard's vote included) Otto of Brunswick was elected on 22 September and crowned immediately in Frankfurt as Otto IV.
Otto IV, who meanwhile had fallen out with Pope Innocent III over Sicily, supported the reascension of Valdemar, the papally dismissed Prince-Archbishop of Bremen. So in 1211 Bernhard escorted his brother-in-law Valdemar into the city of Bremen, de facto regaining the see.
With his acquisition of Saxon estates, Bernhard moved his residence and court to Wittenberg. In 1260 (with effect as from 1296 on) his grandsons split the "Duchy" into the Duchies of Saxe-Wittenberg (German: "Herzogtum Sachsen-Wittenberg") and Saxe-Lauenburg (German: "Herzogtum Sachsen-Lauenburg"), the latter holding the unconnected two northern territories. Wittenberg remained a residence of the House of Ascania until the extinction of this line in 1422. On his death, aged seventy-two, Bernhard was buried beside his father Albert and several of his brothers in the Church of the Benedictine monastery in Ballenstedt.
Marriage and issue.
Bernhard first married Brigitte (or Jutta), a daughter of Canute V of Denmark; secondly Sophia, daughter of Louis II, "the Iron", Landgrave of Thuringia; and thirdly Judith (b. bef. 1154 – d. aft. 12 December 1201), daughter of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and High Duke of all Poland.

Factoring frequently into the testimony of former CIA spy Abdurahman Khadr, is the unknown Canadian figure identified only as Idriss.
When asked to name Canadians who had attended Khalden training camp with him, Khadr listed off a series of known names, as well as Idriss. He later claimed that Amer el-Maati had given his Canadian passport to Idriss, who used it to enter Azerbaijan in a failed attempt to blow up the American embassy in Baku in 1998.
According to Khadr, Idriss was arrested and sent to Egypt. Azerbaijan has said they secretly turned over two arrested suspects to the United States, although most reports suggest they were sent back to Egypt.

Sanborn House (Winchester, Massachusetts)

The Sanborn House is one of the few surviving country house models in Winchester, Massachusetts. Nine and one-half acres of property was purchased in 1904 by Oren Sanborn, younger son of James Sanborn, the co-founder of Chase & Sanborn Coffee Company. 
History.
Oren Sanborn and his wife Lorena (Rena) had lived in Winchester since 1901. The Sanborn House, designed in the beaux-arts style by architects Clinton M. Hill and Thomas M. James, was erected in 1906/07 at a cost of $250,000.
Their new home, which they called Aigremont, with its understated exterior and ornamented interior, set the stage for their role as prominent Winchester citizens. Oren was a member of the Winchester Country Club and the Calumet Social Club. Rena, active in Winchester Society, helped found the Winchester Hospital and led fundraising efforts for the hospital for many years.
The family fortune declined in the early 1920s and the house was sold. The Downes family, founders of Downes Lumber of Boston, used it as a family home for the next two decades. Their decision to sell the house and surrounding land to the Religious of Christian Education, an order of nuns, was significant in the ongoing preservation of the house during the years after World War II when so many large homes of the Victorian and Edwardian period were destroyed. The nuns built a grade school, the Marycliff Academy, on what had been the western paddock and used the house as their residence.
In 1969, the Town of Winchester purchased the Marycliff Academy and the adjacent Sanborn house. The school became the present Ambrose Elementary School (rebuilt in 2005), and the Sanborn House became home to a variety of occupants, most recently the town Recreation Department. In 1981, the Sanborn House was one of first properties in Winchester to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Sanborn House was vacated in 2003 to facilitate construction of the new Ambrose School. In 2005 the Massachusetts Historical Commission recognized the Sanborn House as a significant and endangered property, awarding the Winchester Historical Society a Preservation Project Funds grant to begin the planning process for restoring the house.
Sanborn House Historical & Cultural Center.
In March 2006 the Winchester Historical Society signed a long term lease for the Sanborn House with the Town of Winchester. The Society took on the stewardship for the restoration of the property and its conversion into the Sanborn House Historical and Cultural Center for the use of the community as well as a home for the Society. 
In 2010, the Society appointed its first Executive Director, Rebekah Beaulieu, who also directs the activities of the Sanborn House. 
As of 2011, the Sanborn House maintains limited open hours and is undergoing a restoration project of the exterior facade, funded in part by a matching grant from the Massachusetts Historical Commission.

Driftwood, Texas

Driftwood is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in northern Hays County, Texas, United States. It lies along Farm to Market Road 150, north of the city of San Marcos, the county seat of Hays County. Its elevation is 1,043 feet (318 m). Although Driftwood is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 78619; the ZCTA for ZIP Code 78619 had a population of 2,467 at the 2010 census, which is far larger than the population of the center of the community itself.
Although the earliest settlers arrived in the area now known as Driftwood around 1850, the community was really established in the 1880s. A post office was among the results of the community's significant growth in that decade. Driftwood shrank almost to a ghost town by the early twentieth century; although it grew somewhat by the middle of the century, it returned to its almost-deserted state by the 1970s.
Driftwood is also home to Driftwood Estate Winery, The Wildflower Barn Event Center,The Salt Lick, a relatively well-known barbecue restaurant and the Lazy 8 Ranch which had its dry mix products featured by the Texas Department of Agriculture in the 2010 Texas State Fair.

Power reverse dual currency note

A "dual currency note" (DC) pays coupons in the investor's domestic currency with the notional in the issuer’s domestic currency. A "reverse dual currency note" (RDC) is a note which pays a foreign interest rate in the investor's domestic currency. A "power reverse dual currency note" (PRDC Note) or "power reverse dual currency bond" (PRDC Bond) is an exotic financial structured product where an investor is seeking a better return and a borrower a lower rate by taking advantage of the interest rate differential between two economies. The power component of the name denotes higher initial coupons and the fact that coupons rises as the domestic/foreign exchange rate depreciates. The power feature comes with a higher risk for the investor, which characterizes the product as leveraged carry trade. Cash flows may have a digital cap feature where the rate gets locked once it reaches a certain threshold. Other add-on features include barriers such as knockouts and cancel provision for the issuer. PRDCs are part of the wider Structured Notes Market.
Market.
The majority of investors are Japanese with 9 billion USD worth of notes issued in 2003 and the issued notional increasing every year thereafter up until 2008 when it sharply declined. Major participants in the market include issuers (usually Supranationals) of the notes under their Euro Medium Term Note program. Also heavily involved are PRDC swap hedgers - the major ones include Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Capital Markets, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, Mizuho Securities, Deutsche Bank, UBS Investment Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays Investment Bank, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas CIB, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Royal Bank of Scotland.
Payoff and cashflows.
The investor pays a coupon times a fixed rate in currency c1 and receives a coupon times a fixed rate in currency c2 times current FX rate divided by the FX rate at the inception of the deal. However, the cash flows are always guaranteed to be positive for the investor. The investor, therefore, has the option to receive cash flows making the payoff similar to a Bermudan style FX option. The swap house is, thus, selling a series of Currency options with a floating rate as a premium; the rate is usually subtracted with a spread.
formula_1
where
Model.
The pricing of PRDCs used to be done using 3-factor grid/lattice or Monte Carlo models where one factor represents the short rate in currency1; the second factor the short rate in currency2; and the third factor the movement in the FX rate between currency1 and currency2. 
Model choice for the interest rate factors varies - for speed reasons, popular choices are Hull-White model, Black-Karasinski model, and extended Cheyette model.
FX model choice also varies among houses - popular choices are Dupire-type local volatility models, stochastic SABR Volatility Models, or models which allow mixing of the two.
Nowadays, most dealers use a variant of the industry-standard LIBOR market model to price the PRDCs.
Computation.
Plain vanilla PRDCs can be broken down into a string of vanilla options.
For Callable PRDCs, which are not replicable, the present value and the risks are now computed using quasi-Monte Carlo simulations and can take several hours. The same can be said of the TARN PRDCs and Chooser PRDCs (which are also callable).
Hedging.
A plain vanilla PRDC is exposed to the movements in interest rates, FX, volatility (on both interest rates and fx), correlation and basis. Those risks are hedged with interest rate swaps in each currency to reduce interest rate risk, interest rate swaptions in each currency to reduce interest rate volatility exposures, FX Options to reduce FX volatility exposures and Basis swaps to reduce basis risk. Correlation exposure can be partially hedged with correlation swaps.
While such hedges are theoretically possible, there are a lot of practical difficulties, largely due to the following situation. The owners of the PRDC notes, usually retail investors, don't hedge their risks in the market. Only the banks, which are all short the notes, actively hedge and rebalance their positions. In other words, if there is a significant move in FX, for example, all the PRDC books will need the same kind of FX volatility rebalancing at the same time. The note holders would be the natural counterparty for the hedge, but they don't take part in this market (similar to buyers of portfolio insurance in 1987). This situation often creates "one way markets" and sometimes liquidity squeeze situations in long term FX volatilities, basis swaps or long end AUD interest rate swaps.
The volume of PRDC notes issued has been so large that the hedging and rebalancing requirements far exceed the available liquidity in several key markets. However every model is derived under the assumption that there is sufficient liquidity - in other words, they are potentially mispricing the trades because in this market, a few of the key standard Black–Scholes assumptions (such as zero transaction cost, unlimited liquidity, no jumps in price) break down. No active secondary market ever existed for PRDC and banks usually mark their books to some consensus level provided by an independent company. Anecdotal evidence indicates that nobody would show a bid anywhere close to that consensus level.
PRDC during Subprime Crisis.
PRDC has been the subject of much attention in the market during the subprime mortgage crisis. By the nature of the trade, investment banks hedging the risks for PRDC structured note issuers will have a short cross gamma position between FX volatility, interest rate and FX. In a volatile market where market parameters move in large and correlated steps, investment banks are forced to rebalance their hedges at a loss, often daily.
In particular, when FX spot goes up, the hedger for a PRDC note is expected to pay more coupons on a PRDC note. Thus, the hedger is more likely to call the note, reducing the expected duration of the note. In this situation, the hedger has to partially unwind the hedges done at the inception of the PRDC note. For example, he would have to pay swaps in the foreign currency. If FX spot moves in a correlated fashion with the foreign currency swap rate (that is, foreign currency swap rate increases as FX spot increases), he would need to pay a higher swap rate as FX spot goes up, and receive a lower swap rate as FX spot goes down. This is an example of how the hedger of a PRDC note is short cross gamma.
This was the main driver behind the increased market volatility in FX skew, long dated FX volatility, long dated Japanese Yen and Australian dollar interest rate, especially during the last quarter of 2008.

According to testimony heard when the case later went to trial, Bowers was asked to leave and Robert Codd escorted him to the door. A struggle ensued outside between Bowers and Codd, and Bowers stabbed Codd several times. Codd died within minutes of the incident.
Bowers was arrested and charged with murder. He was convicted on 23 October 1984 and given the mandatory sentence of death by hanging. Bowers appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal of Belize, but his arguments were rejected. Bowers's petition for clemency was rejected by Manuel Esquivel, the Prime Minister of Belize.
Bowers was hanged on 19 June 1985. No one has been executed by Belize since Bowers, but capital punishment remains as a possible legal punishment in Belize.

Flower robot

]
In home automation systems and robotics, a flower robot is a simple electromechanical device with the appearance of a common flower, with components such as stem and leaves. First developed by Berufsbildende Schule 1 Kaiserslautern in 2006 and later by Carnegie Mellon University in 2007, flower robots are used as intelligent home appliances, with capabilities such as sensing, simple actuation for movements, and effectors such as lights or humidifier.
Overview.
Similar to a flower, the robotic flower contains components such stems and leaves, with small sensors and effectors embedded in the structure. The flower robot developed at Carnegie Mellon University utilized a seven degree of freedom structure, with one used to move the stem towards the left and right, and six other for moving the leaves. Built using simple DC servos, the base structure of the robot actuates the leaves, and uses the IR sensors built in on three of its petals to track objects. 
Designed as an intelligent home appliance, the robotic flower has a variety of different functions. Primarily, the flower robot is used as a background sensing device, as it contains sensors for temperature, pressure, voice and light intensity. Unlike other sensors with similar purpose, the appearance of the flower robot makes it easier blend into various rooms, providing more convenient control and accurate results. In addition, the flower robot is capable of small movements using its servos, which can be used to mimic the blooming flower and the stirring of leaves in the wind, creating an aesthetically pleasing environment. Other functions of the flower robot include vision or voice recording, illumination and the use of a scent emitter and a humidifier.
Development.
The development of the flower power robot has sparked interests in the shape memory alloy research, as such smart materials can better approximate the motions of a real flower. A group of Korean researchers proposed at the 2007 International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics the design of a new flower power robot with such materials, and an improvement in performance of the flower robot were shown by numerical simulations.

Hiroyuki Hamada

Hiroyuki Hamada was Born in Satsumasendai, Kagoshima on October 29, 1925. He was the founder of Nihon Koden Shindo Ryu Karatedo and master of Felton Messina.
History.
At the age of 15 he began to practice the Okinawan style of Karate called Tomari-Ha in 1939. On March 1943, he graduated from high school after having lost 2 years of classes due to World War II, time which he used to concentrate in the study of Karate. That year he began to study other Okinawan styles such as, Shuri-Te and To-Te. Between April 1943 and March 1944 he dedicated himself fully to the practice and perfection of Karate.
On April 1944, he joined the Japanese Marines. By the time the war ended in 1945, he was part of one of the Air Force squads from Kurashiki. When the news of Japan's defeat reached him, he spent 10 days considering if he should commit Seppuku. After those 10 days he firmly decided to live and help others through Karate-Do. On August 1945, he returns to the city of Satsumasendai.
Creation of the style.
Between 1945 and 1952 he intensified his Karate practices, traveling throughout Japan and dedicating himself to the study of two styles of Karate: Nihon Shindo Karate-Do and Nihon-Den Karate-Do. In 1952 he joined the Fire Department in his hometown and for the first time taught Karate. On the morning of March 28, 1964, in a Shinto temple called Isekotaigingie in the province of Mie, Japan, he created Nihon Koden Shindo Ryu. This new style of Karate he created was based on the modifications he made to the techniques he learned from the other styles of karate.
Actuality.
In 1975 he traveled to the Dominican Republic with Professor Jamaguchi (6th Dan in Judo) and Kenji Moriyama (5th Dan) to give Karate -Do classes. In one month, he performed exhibitions throughout the island and left Felton Messina in charge of the style in the Dominican Republic. On April, 1980 he retires from being Chief of the Fire Department in Satsumasendai. He dedicated his whole life to the practice and teaching of Karatedo and was the So-shihan (Supreme Master) of Nihon Koden Shindo Ryu until his death on September 16, 2003. Before his death in 2003, he gave Felton Messina the rank of So Shihan and left him in charge of the style outside Japan. The person in charge of the style in Japan is Hamada's nephew So Shihan Eturou Takeshita.

Although his assets were frozen, Hussein was released on bail after a court found that neither the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) nor the U.S. were able to provide any evidence of terrorist links.
Life before arrest.
Hussein ran two businesses in Ottawa. The first was a cleaning company he started in the hopes of being able to offer his family employment, improving their chances of successful immigration to Canada. The second was a "hawala" money transfer business named "Barakaat North America Inc." which his brother managed in Massachusetts. When it was announced that al-Qaeda was believed to have ties to the Somali money service which Hussein contracted, his brother was arrested in Boston and the cleaning franchise revoked Hussein's license.
Hussein went to the Ottawa police department, where he was arrested at the request of the United States. He was later represented by lawyer Michael Edelson.
After being released.
On June 3, 2002, the Canadian government announced that they had been shown "no evidence" suggesting Hussein was linked to terrorism, and that charges were to be dropped. His name was removed from the Canadian list of individuals supporting terrorism, and later off the American and United Nations lists as well.
The Civil Liberties Association of Ottawa was quoted in newspapers that "the government destroyed this man's life without a single shred of evidence".

Winchester Savings Bank

The Winchester Savings Bank is a historic bank building at 26 Mt. Vernon Street in Winchester, Massachusetts.
The Romanesque structure was built in 1892 by William Blaikie and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
The Winchester Savings Bank was established by the Massachusetts Legislature and incorporated on March 3, 1871. The first meeting of the Corporators was held in Lyceum Hall (the building at the corner of Main and Mt. Vernon Streets in Winchester) on July 11, 1871. The Bank first opened its doors for business on August 26, 1871, in a banking room on the north side of Main Street.
It was generally predicted that the Bank would not be a success, but on opening day, $11,058 was deposited, with most of this total coming from the Bank's Trustees and Corporators.
In 1880, the Bank moved to the second floor of the Brown and Stanton Block on Main Street, and remained there until 1892 when it moved into its newly constructed building at 26 Mt. Vernon Street. This building still stands today, and is regarded as a historical building by the Winchester Historical Society. The Bank's main office was moved on December 10, 1979 to its present location at 661 Main Street. Since its founding in 1871, the Bank has grown into a full-service financial institution.

Astra A-100

The Astra A-100 is a Spanish double-action/single-action semi-automatic pistol that was manufactured by Astra-Unceta y Cia SA beginning in 1990. It was distributed in the United States by European American Armory (EAA). The A-100 is also known as the "Panther" as imported into the United States by EAA, and some specimens have this roll-marked on the left of the slide. The A-100 design is a further development of Astra's earlier A-80 and A-90 models.
The A-100 is a recoil-operated, locked breech design with improved Browning-style linkless locking. The lock up is similar to the Browning High Power or CZ-75 with locking lugs on the top of the barrel which mate with lugs in the slide (not with a single lug in the ejection port like a SIG P22X.) The pistol's safety features include a manual decocking lever, firing pin block, and hammer safety. The A-100 lacks a manual safety, but depends entirely on a deliberate pull of its trigger to fire it; in this way it is similar to the SIG P22X series of pistols. The double action trigger pull is relatively long and heavy, thereby precluding the need for a safety as the probability of an inadvertent discharge is low.
The A-100 resembles the SIG P228 and is similar in overall size and dimension, but differs in several respects, the most visible being the location of the take-down/disassembly lever on the right side of the frame (from the shooter's point of view) as compared to the SIG design, in which it is located on the left. The A-100 is also slightly heavier than the SIG, owing to its all-steel construction. Additionally, the A-100's chamber contour as visible when the slide is fully forward is rounded whereas the SIG design is squared. The configuration of the hammer is also different, with the A-100 having a rounded hammer provided with a lanyard hole and the SIG having a more conventional spur hammer. Magazines are not interchangeable between the A-100 and SIG pistols, however many holsters made for the SIG P229/228 fit the A-100 satisfactorily.
The various A-series pistols were submitted unsuccessfully as contenders for Spanish military contracts beginning in the 1970s. The Lebanese Forces political party named the A-80, A-90, and A-100 as a few of the many semi-automatic pistols in use by that organization's members.

Saab Information Display

Saab Information Display, or SID, later also called 'Saab Car Computer'(SCC) is the name for various in-car computer systems found on most Saab automobiles beginning in 1994 with the Saab 900 NG.
SIDs typically provide functions useful to the driver such as multiple trip odometers, fuel efficiency, estimated range ('distance to empty' - DTE), current CD track or radio station, and also brief description of car system failures. SIDs designed prior to the full General Motors takeover of Saab in 2000 were mounted in the center console, usually just above the head unit and below climate control vents.
On 2003 - 2005 Saab 9-3 models, the SID was temporarily moved to the top of the dashboard just below the windshield, in an enclosed hump facing the driver.
GM began moving SIDs in all Saabs to the electronic instrument cluster, just above the steering wheel, as stock GM navigation and/or audio head units replaced the Saab-designed units in the center console. The 2005 - 2006 Saab 9-2X did not feature an authentic SID, having a less feature-rich Subaru unit instead.
<br clear = "right">
SID pixel failure.
Saab Information Displays from 1994 - 2003 commonly suffer from an electrical system failure that results in some or all of the on-screen liquid crystal display (LCD) pixel lines becoming invisible, rendering the SID difficult to read or, in some cases, entirely unusable. The problem is most often caused not by defective pixels, but by some or all of the LCD's flexible flat cable (ribbon cable) contacts separating from the main logic board.
As the 1994-2005 units often cost over US$500 to replace, several third party vendors offer a service to permanently fix broken SIDs, for a fee.
The frequency of the problem strongly suggests a design flaw, but Saab/GM has never issued a product recall.

Lowake, Texas

Lowake is an unincorporated community in northwestern Concho County, Texas, United States, along the Concho River. It lies along FM 381 north of the town of Paint Rock, the county seat of Concho County. Its elevation is 1,752 feet (534 m). Although Lowake is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 76855; the post office was established in 1909.
Founded in 1909, midway between Miles and Paint Rock, Lowake was named for local farmers named Lowe and Schlake, upon whose land the community was built. Lowake's school was merged with that of Paint Rock in the 1950s.
Despite its small size, Lowake was well-known in the 1960s as the site of a famous Lowake Steakhouse. The steakhouse is currently still in operation (as of 2013).
There were at least two steakhouses, one of which was the "Lowake Inn", a restaurant and gathering place for locals in this small community. Travelers to Lowake not only came by road, but also by air; a nearby airstrip allowed pilots of small aircraft to come and go, within easy walking distance of the Inn.

Grupo Nutresa

Grupo Nutresa formerly Grupo Nacional de Chocolates S.A. (English: National Chocolates Group) is a food processing conglomerate headquartered in Medellín, Colombia.
The group's principal activity is operating the food industry with focus on producing, distributing and selling cold cuts, biscuits, chocolates, coffee, ice cream and pasta. The company markets its products under approximately 70 different brands in 65 countries. Other activities include the investment or application of resources or cash under whatever form authorized by law and the exploration of the metal-mechanic and packaging industry.
In 2004, the group began their international expansion, acquiring several companies in Central America and the Caribbean. As of 2008, the Grupo Nacional de Chocolates continue expanding and consolidating their presence in the region. The market value of the company grew by a factor of 25 in the decade leading up to 2010 (to US$6 billion). Though originally a chocolatier, the sale of chocolates contributed only 19% to sales in 2010.
Company history.
Formation of the group.
In 1916, Fábrica de Galletas y Confites -- a company making biscuits (cookies and crackers) and confectionery -- was set up in Medellin, Colombia. In 1925, the company changed its name to Fábrica de Galletas Noel S.A. and again in 1999 to Compañía de Galletas Noel S.A. In 1920, a chocolate-processing company under the name of Compañía Nacional de Chocolates Cruz Roja was founded and later changed its name to Compañía Nacional de Chocolates, S.A. In 1933 this chocolate company bought an interest in the biscuit company paving the way for the formation of the conglomerate. From 1933 to 1958, the group continued to consolidate its distribution network resulting in strengthened national presence and corporate image.
In the business of coffee.
In 1933 the "Sello Rojo" (EN: Red Seal) brand was created when the company entered the coffee business. In 1950, with the boom of the coffee industry, Compañía Colombiana de Café S.A.- Colcafé, was created and soon become an important Colombian export company. The first export of any company of the group was in 1961 -- coffee to Japan.
International expansion.
In 1993, the confectionery company, Compañía Dulces de Colombia S.A. was set up. In 1995, the Organization’s trading companies were established abroad forming what is known today as the Cordialsa network, first in Ecuador and second in Venezuela. The company also made its first investment abroad and expanded its meat-processing business with Industrias Alimenticias Hermo de Venezuela S.A. In 1999, the Organization spun off two of its companies, Noel and Zenú.
In 2003, the holding company Inversiones Nacional de Chocolates S.A. came into being, with important interests in chocolate and coffee businesses as well as the Organization’s food investment company Inveralimenticias (that has holdings in the meat, cookie and confectionery business). In 2004, the organization began expanding into Central America and the Caribbean through the purchase of Nestle’s cookie and chocolate plants in Costa Rica. In 2006, the Organization changed its name to Grupo Nacional de Chocolates S.A. On 1 February 2007, Grupo Nacional de Chocolates purchased Peruvian company Good Foods S.A. and the Winter's brand for US$36 million through its Peruvian subsidiary Compañía Nacional de Chocolates de Perú S.A..
Image change.
On March 31, 2011 the company changed its name to Grupo Nutresa in a move made to emphasize the diversity of its products that now includes pasta and cold cuts.
Strategy.
The company mission is to progressively create value, obtain an outstanding return on investment and surpass the cost of employed capital. The organization seeks to improve consumers’ quality of life and the progress of employees.

Colonel Mahmoud Chérif (1912 – 1987) was an Algerian military leader and politician. He was born in Chéria in the Tébessa governorship (wilaya) in 1912. After school, he joined the French army and graduated from training courses with the rank of lieutenant. He participated as a French-Algerian soldier on the side of the Allies in the Second World War. After the war, he joined Ferhat Abbas's UDMA movement, which worked peacefully—but unsuccessfully—for Algerian rights. Soon after the outbreak of the Algerian War of Independence in 1954, he joined the Front de libération nationale (FLN) resistance movement, where his military command experience guaranteed him an important role. He headed the rebellion in FLN's Wilaya I -- an area which included the Tébessa region—and was later promoted colonel in the Armée de libération nationale (ALN), FLN's armed wing.

<doc id="18852926" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18852926" title="International Standard Name Identifier">
International Standard Name Identifier

The International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) is a method for uniquely identifying the public identities of contributors to media content such as books, TV programmes, and newspaper articles. Such an identifier consists of 16 numerical digits divided into four blocks. 
It was developed under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as Draft International Standard 27729; the valid standard was published 2012-03-15. The ISO technical committee 46, subcommittee 9 (TC 46/SC 9) is responsible for the development of the standard.
ISNI can be used for disambiguating names that might otherwise be confused, and links the data about names that are collected and used in all sectors of the media industries.
Uses of an ISNI.
The ISNI allows a single identity (such as an author’s pseudonym or the imprint used by a publisher) to be identified using a unique number. This unique number can then be linked to any of the numerous other identifiers that are used across the media industries to identify names and other forms of identity.
An example of the use of such a number is the identification of a musical performer who is also a writer both of music and of poems. Where he or she might currently be identified in many different databases using numerous private and public identification systems, under the ISNI system, he or she would have a single linking ISNI record. The many different databases could then exchange data about that particular identity without resorting to messy methods such as comparing text strings. An often quoted example in the English language world is the difficulty faced when identifying ‘John Smith’ in a database. While there may be many records for ‘John Smith’, it is not always clear which record refers to the specific ‘John Smith’ that is required.
If an author has published under several different names or pseudonyms, each such name will receive its own ISNI.
ISNI can be used by libraries and archives when sharing catalogue information; for more precise searching for information online and in databases, and it can aid the management of rights across national borders and in the digital environment.
ORCID.
ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifiers are reserved block of ISNI identifiers, for scholarly researchers. administered by a separate organisation. Individual researchers can create and claim their own ORCID identifier. The two organisations coordinate their efforts.
ISNI governance.
ISNI is governed by an ‘International Agency’, commonly known as the ISNI-IA. This UK registered, not-for-profit company has been founded by a consortium of organisations consisting of the Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d´Auteurs et Compositeurs (CISAC), the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL), the International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations (IFRRO), the International Performers Database Association (IPDA), the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) and ProQuest. It is managed by directors nominated from these organisations and, in the case of CENL, by representatives of the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the British Library.
ISNI assignment.
ISNI-IA uses an assignment system comprising a user interface, data-schema, disambiguation algorithms, and database that meets the requirements of the ISO standard, while also using existing technology where possible. The system is based primarily on the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) service, which has been developed by OCLC for use in the aggregation of library catalogues.
Access to the assignment system and database, and to the numbers that are generated as the output of the process, are controlled by independent bodies known as 'registration agencies'. These registration agencies deal directly with customers, ensuring that data is provided in appropriate formats and recompensing the ISNI-IA for the cost of maintaining the assignment system. Registration agencies are appointed by ISNI-IA but will be managed and funded independently.

Louis Charles, Count of Eu

Louis Charles de Bourbon, Count of Eu (October 15, 1701 – July 13, 1775) was a grandson of Louis XIV of France and his "Maîtresse-en-titre" Françoise-Athénaïs de Montespan. He was a member of the legitimised house of Bourbon du Maine. He was the last surviving member of the house.
Life.
Born at his parents famous Château de Sceaux near Versailles on October 15, 1701, he was the yongest and last surviving son of Louis Auguste de Bourbon, the "duc du Maine" and his wife, the salon hostess Anne Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon. 
He grew up with his elder brother, Louis-Auguste (known as the "prince de Dombes" and was very close to him and his younger sister Louise Françoise de Bourbon (1707–1743), known as "Mademoiselle du Maine". 
Like his siblings he remained unmarried and childless all his life. On his father's death in 1736 he gained the title of "Duke of Aumale". He was also made the "Grand Maître de l'artillerie de France" (Grand Master of the Artillery of France) which was a post that his father had also held. 
It was his elder brother who was his father's main heir. On his brother's death in 1755 as a result of a duel, Louis Charles was his brother's heir and thus became the head of the House of Bourbon du Maine. He inherited the family titles; prince de Dombes (1755–1762), prince d'Anet, duc de Gisors, comte de Dreux and baron de Sceaux. From his brothers death he also inherited the famed Governorship of Languedoc and his brothers many châteaux. 
Like his elder brother he was little seen at court and preferred to hunt on his estate of the Château d'Anet.
In March 1762 he exchanged with Louis XV the very profitable principality of the Dombes for the duchy of Gisors and lands of Gretz-Armainvilliers et de Pontcarré. 
Like his cousin, the famously generous and wealthy Duke of Penthièvre, Louis-Charles was popular with the people of France as a result of his charitable doings. Again in 1773, he offered to sell the Duchy of Aumale, County of Eu and the lands of Anet to Louis XV. The sum agreed was a vast 12 Million Livres.
It was at Sceaux that Louis Charles died at the age of 73 in October 1775. As he never had any children, he did not have an heir to the large Bourbon du Maine fortune. As a result, his chosen heir was his younger cousin the Duke of Penthièvre -son of the Count of Toulouse, the youngest brother of the duc du Maine.

Union Pacific R. Co. v. Cheyenne

Union Pacific R. Co. v. Cheyenne, , was an appeal from the Supreme Court of the Territory of Wyoming regarding a bill charging that the collection of an illegal tax would involve the plaintiff in a multiplicity of suits as to the title of lots being laid out and sold, which would prevent their sale, and which would cloud the title to all his real estate, states a case for relief in equity.
An Act of the Legislature of Wyoming, passed December 13, 1879, required the state auditor to furnish to the territorial board of equalization a list for assessment and taxation of the roadbed, superstructure, and other enumerated property of every railroad and telegraph company in the territory when any portion of the property of such company was situated in more than one county, and required the board to value and assess the property of the corporation for each mile of its road or line, and to certify to the county clerks of the counties in which the property was situated the assessment per mile, specifying the number of miles and amount in each of the counties, and which required the county commissioners to decide and adjust the number of miles and amounts within each precinct, township, or school district within their respective counties and cause such amounts to be entered on the lists of taxable property returned by the assessors, withdrew the duty of assessing fractional parts of such railroad and the property of such companies from all local assessors in the territory, including its incorporated cities.
A statute which provides a general scheme for assessing and taxing the property of railroad and telegraph companies as a whole and for distributing it ratably among the different counties and their several precincts, townships and districts according to the number of miles of line in each repeals, as to such property, a power conferred upon the authorities of a city to make provisions for the assessment of the taxes which they were authorized by other provisions of the city charter to assess and collect.
The bill in this case was filed by the Union Pacific Railway Company against the City of Cheyenne and its marshal, Ryan, to enjoin the collection of certain city taxes for the year 1880, which the railway company alleges were unlawfully assessed against it. The bill was demurred to by the defendants, and the District Court for the First Judicial District of Wyoming, in which the suit was brought, overruled the demurrer, and granted the injunction prayed for. The defendants adhered the their demurrer and appealed to the supreme court of the territory, and the decree of the district court was reversed and the bill ordered to be dismissed, and the case is now brought here by appeal.
The main question raised by the bill is whether the Union Pacific Railroad, which passes through the whole length of Wyoming Territory, and in its course passes through the City of Cheyenne, with its accompanying telegraph, appurtenances, and rolling stock, is liable to be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation in Cheyenne by the city authorities, or only by the territorial board of equalization, consisting of the 
The high court found that the allegations of the bill in this case bring it fairly within the jurisdiction of the court. It showed that it would involve the plaintiff in a multiplicity of suits as to title of lots laid out and being sold; would prevent their sale, and would cloud the title to all its real estate. We think that these results are sufficiently apparent, and render it unnecessary to look further. The allegation of fraud has not been proven, and cannot therefore have any effect in the case. It is unnecessary to inquire into the sufficiency of other grounds for equitable relief which are alleged in the bill.
Another point raised by the defendants, not affecting the jurisdiction of the court but the propriety of its taking jurisdiction, is that the complainant ought to have paid the taxes which are conceded to be due to the city for the year 1880. As the court understood the facts stated by the bill (which, of course, the demurrer admits to be true), the complainant did pay to the city all the taxes which would be due upon the assessment and valuation made by the board of equalization, including taxes due on outside property of the company in the city.
The court found that the decree of the Supreme Court of Wyoming should be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to enter a decree in favor of the complainant in conformity with this opinion, and it was so ordered.
