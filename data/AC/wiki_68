Michael (novel)

Michael: A German Destiny in Diary Form (ISBN 0941693007) is a semi-autobiographical novel authored by the German propagandist Joseph Goebbels and published in 1929. The novel is a combination of Goebbels' own thoughts and the life of his best friend Richard Flisges who had actually fought in World War I, and later ended his college studies to work in a mine where he died in an accident. That is what happens to the novel's protagonist Michael who meets his "sacrificial death" on 29 January 1921.
Plot.
In a diary form the story follows the journey of Michael, a fictional character who represents a young Joseph Goebbels. At the beginning of the novel Michael has just returned home from service in the Great War. He finds a new democratic Germany which invokes feelings of both love and hate. Throughout the novel Michael wrestles with this mix of nationalist pride and anger towards Weimar Germany and he explores his personal philosophy and belief system.
Political commentary.
The book emphasises the socialist ideals held by Goebbels early in his political career.
Religious commentary.
In the novel Goebbels gives praise to Christianity, and describes Jesus as one of the finest men to have ever lived. He also demonstrates his early socialist sympathies when he stated that Germans had to be "something like Christ Socialists" The book also explores nature of God and the contemporary man: "modern man...is intrinsically a seeker of God, perhaps a Christ-man." It was written before Goebbels gradually lost his Catholic faith.
Historical analysis.
Joseph Goebbels' biographer, the historian Joachim Fest (who was also Hitler's biographer), suggests that "Michael" sheds light on Goebbels' state of mind and self-image: "The very name of the hero, Michael, to whom he gave many autobiographical features, suggests the way his self-identification was pointing: a figure of light, radiant, tall, unconquerable," and above all "'To be a soldier! To stand sentinel! One ought always to be a soldier,' wrote Michael-Goebbels."

Jan Jacob Rochussen

Jan Jacob Rochussen (23 October 1797 – 21 January 1871) was a Dutch politician. He served as Finance Minister from 1840 to 1843 and Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1845 to 1851. He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 18 March 1858 to 23 February 1860.
Life and politics.
Rochussen was born in the town of Etten, North Brabant, on 23 October 1797 to Jan Rochussen, a member of the provincial government, and his wife. In 1815 Rochussen served in a volunteer corps against Napoleon's armies.
Rochussen found employment as a tax collector in Schiedam, South Holland beginning in 1814. Over the next twelve years he served as tax collector in 's-Hertogenbosch, Rotterdam, and later Amsterdam. He was then selected as secretary at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, serving from 22 January until 10 August 1826. Leaving the chamber, he worked at an entrepôt – a trading post for the import and export of goods without paying duties – and eventually managed it from 18 July 1828 until 31 July 1840. It was during his time at the entrepôt that Rochussen found the favour of King William I of the Netherlands; Rochussen later served as the king's adviser and became close to him.
Rochussen was selected to become Minister of Finance by in the king's last year of his reign, taking office on 31 July 1840. Rochussen worked to straighten the country's public finances, which were incredibly disordered. However, after a proposal to convert the nation's debt failed 30 to 24 in the Second Chamber, Rochussen was forced to resign. He was later selected as a special envoy to Brussels, a post which he held for nearly two years and which resulted in him settling inheritance and property issues to the satisfaction of both sides.
In February 1845, Rochussen was reassigned as Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies with Royal Decree of 5 February 1845. He arrived in the colonial capital of Batavia (modern day Jakarta) on 30 September of that year. Before his departure, former governor general Jean Chrétien Baud recommended that Rochussen take an interest in the Javanese people. Although Rochussen initially intended to build greater infrastructure in the Indies, he later felt that a full autocracy was necessary and as such instituted severe limitations to press freedom. He also instituted reforms in the nation's monetary system.
On 12 May 1851 Rochussen was called back to the Netherlands. On 20 September, he began a term as a member of the House of Representatives representing Alkmaar. He served in this capacity until 28 January 1857. A year later, he became the prime minister after fifteen days forming the cabinet in collaboration with Jan Karel van Goltstein. He served from 18 March 1858 until 1 January 1861, on which date he resigned due to his proposed budget being failed at the house meeting on 14 December 1860. He then helped Schelto van Heemstra form the new cabinet.
After his term as prime minister, Rochussen returned to the House as a representative of Amsterdam, serving three consecutive terms from 14 November 1864 until 20 September 1869.
Rochussen died in The Hague on 21 January 1871.
Legacy.
Rochussen was brought into the Order of the Dutch Lion as a Knight on 4 July 1829. After being made Commander on 28 November 1840, he was given the highest rank of Knight Grand Cross on 10 October 1841. On 18 April 1852, he was made a Grand Cross of the Order of the Oak Crown, an order of Luxembourg. Eight years later, he was made a Knight First Class of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau.
The Moluccan Woodcock "Scolopax rochussenii" and the orchid species "Coelogyne rochussenii" are named after Rochussen.
Family.
After several years of living together, Rochussen married Anna Sara Velsberg in Amsterdam on 14 December 1831; they had nine children together before Velsberg's death on 18 June 1841. His second marriage was to a Creole woman, Elisabeth Charlotta Vincent, on 2 September 1848 while he was in Batavia; the couple produced two daughters, with Vincent dying in childbirth for the second.
Rochussen's son Willem Frederik Rochussen went on to be Minister of Foreign Affairs from 15 September 1881 until 23 April 1883. He also had several sons-in-law and nephews who entered politics, such as Jacob van Zuylen van Nijevelt, Frederik s'Jacob (future governor of the Dutch East Indies), and representative GA de Raadt. His grandson, Herman Adriaan van Karnebeek, became mayor of The Hague, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and later President of the League of Nations from 1921 to 1922.

Robert Townsend Farquhar

Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar, 1st Baronet (14 October 1776 – 16 March 1830) was an influential British merchant of the early nineteenth century who served as a colonial governor and Member of Parliament.During his lengthy service for both the East India Company and the British government,Farquhar gained a reputation as an efficient and ambitious administrator and he notably served as Lieutenant-Governor of Prince of Wales Island (Penang Island) from January 1804 to 1805 and as governor of Bourbon from 1810 to 1811.
He was the 1st Governor of Mauritius from 4 December 1810 to 20 May 1823. During his tenure on Mauritius, Farquhar became well known for his operations against French slave traders, having previously investigated the possibility of replacing slaves with paid Chinese labourers. After returning to Britain Farquhar, who was made a baronet in 1821, sat in Parliament for Newton and later for Hythe.
Life.
Farquhar was born in 1776, the second son of Walter Farquhar, an eminent Scottish physician, and his wife Anne Harvie. Farquhar was educated at Westminster School and at age 17 was employed as a writer by the East India Company and stationed in Madras. Farquhar rose rapidly in the company and by the late 1790s was the commercial resident in Amboyna, a former Dutch colony seized during the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1802, at the Peace of Amiens, Farquhar was charged with assessing British claims on the colony as it was returned to the Batavian Republic. 
During his time at Amboyna, Farquhar earned the Governor of Madras' displeasure by initiating a successful attack on the Dutch settlement of Ternate after the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. Demoted and sent back to London, Farquhar submitted his resignation together with a strongly worded letter of vindication to the Governor-General, Lord Wellesley. Impressed with Farquhar's initiative and direct approach, Wellesley offered him the governorship of Penang. During his administration at Penang, Farquhar began public works activities to improve roads, water supply and the fortification of the settlement. Farquhar Street in Penang is named after him.
Farquhar became interested in the labour problems that rose from the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, and published a scheme to replace African slaves with paid Chinese labourers entitled "Suggestions for counteracting any injurious effects upon the population of the West India colonies from the abolition of the slave trade", although the idea did not gain widespread support. In January 1809, he married Maria Frances Geslip, a Madras heiress. In July 1810, Farquhar was ordered to accompany the fleet under Commodore Josias Rowley that was to invade the French colony of Île Bonaparte, known today as Réunion. The attack was successful and Farquhar remained on the island as governor, moving to Mauritius in December 1810 after a successful invasion of the island under Admiral Albemarle Bertie (He was depicted by Patrick O'Brian in the Mauritius Command.
During his time as governor of the Indian Ocean islands, Farquhar had extensive maritime charts made of the region and encouraged trade with Madagascar and Mozambique, occasionally with disastrous results for the traders involved. He also made significant military and diplomatic efforts to end the East African slave trade, aggressively deploying naval units against the French ships that carried the slaves and conducting treaties with Madagascar and Muscat. Farquhar remained Governor on Mauritus for 13 years (although he took a leave of absence between 1817 and 1820) and for his service, he was made a baronet in 1821. He resigned from the post in 1823 and returned to Britain, taking the seat for Newton in Parliament in 1825 and the following year moving to Hythe. Adopting the surname Townsend in 1824, Farquhar served on the board of directors of the East India Company and the Alliance Insurance Company and also remained in Parliament until his death in March 1830 at his home in Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, London.

Marino Pieretti

Marino Paul Pieretti (September 23, 1920 – January 30, 1981) was an Italian-born American professional baseball player. Born in Lucca, in Tuscany, he grew up in San Francisco's North Beach district. He was a right-handed pitcher who appeared in 194 games, 68 as a starter, in the Major Leagues from through for the Washington Senators, Chicago White Sox, and Cleveland Indians. 
Pieretti stood tall and weighed . A stalwart in the Pacific Coast League of the era (he won 122 games and lost 112 for various PCL teams between 1943 and 1956), he came to the Majors after winning 26 games for the 1944 Portland Beavers. He was known as "Submariner" in his stint with the Portland Beavers because of his sidewinder delivery. His rookie season was his finest. Pitching for the second-place Senators, he won 14 of 27 decisions and completed 14 of his 27 starting assignments, hurling three shutouts. For his MLB career, he compiled a 30–38 record with an earned run average of 4.53 in 673⅔ innings pitched, allowing 713 hits and 321 bases on balls. He notched 188 career strikeouts, eight saves and 21 complete games.
Pieretti, who worked in a slaughterhouse in the offseason, lived in San Francisco after his playing days. When he was stricken with cancer in the mid-1970s, his friends — many of them former baseball players from the Bay Area — organized "The Friends of Marino Pieretti" to buoy his spirits. Pieretti's health improved for a time, and he was able to attend regular meetings until his death at age 60 early in 1981. However, The Friends of Marino Pieretti were still meeting in his honor every month as of January 2011.

Kuai (dish)

Kuai () was a Chinese dish consisting of finely cut strips of raw fish or meat, which was popular and commonly eaten in the early history and dynastic times of China. According to the Book of Rites (禮記) compiled between 202 BCE–220 CE, kuai consists of small thin slices or strips of raw meat, which are prepared by first thinly slicing the meat and then cutting the thin slices into strips. In modern times, the dishes are more often referred to as "raw fish slices" () or as "yusheng" (魚生, yúshēng). Commonly used fish in ancient times include carp (鯉) and mandarin fish (鳜), but salmon (鮭) is also used in modern times.
Sauces were an essential part of kuai dishes, with green onions used for preparation of sauces in spring and mustard seed used for sauces in autumn (膾，春用蔥，秋用芥, "Book of Rites"). According to many classical texts, kuai served without sauces was deemed inedible and should be avoided (不得其醬不食, "Analects").
History.
Raw fish and meat dishes, know collectively as kuai, were first documented in China in the Zhou Dynasty (1045–256 BC), and are mentioned in the Shi Jing, Classic of Rites, Analects of Confucius, and "Mencius". A related preparation method is "xuan" (軒), which involve slicing the raw meat in large thin pieces in the manner of carpaccio, however the term "kuai" was used to refer to this method. Kuai is the preferred preparation of raw beef and lamb, or fish such as the carp, while meats from wild deers and boars were prepared as xuan. Thinness in the slices or strips was an important factor for judging the quality of the dish (膾不厭細, "Analects"). During this dynasty and the ensuing Warring States period kuai made from all fauna were widely consumed.
During the time of the Qin (221–206 BC) and Han Dynasties (206 BC–220 CE) kuai made from the meat of land fauna became less popular with the term used to refer more and more to thinly slice raw fish. The dish was widely consumed by all classes and coincides with the appearance of the character "鱠" (kuai) with its fish radical (魚) during this period (alongside the character 膾 with the "" meat radical). In addition, characters such as "燴" (kuai) with the fire radical were introduced to indicate fish that has grilled to the rare stage and then thinly sliced, similar to Japanese Tataki. Indeed kuai and raw fish were so commonly consumed that Ying Shao(應劭) in his Fengsu TongYi (風俗通義), a manuscript that described the odd and exotic practices of various cultures and peoples, stated that "In Zhu-A, raw fish is not consumed" (祝、阿不食生魚, chap. 釋忌), alluding to the perceived oddity of not eating fish raw. It is also during this period that the renowned dish jinji yukuai (金齏玉膾) along its accompanying baheji sauce (八和齏) was created (齊民要術 Qi Min Yao Shu, scroll 8).
Although the dish was not widely consumed during later dynasties in China, it enjoyed a very high status in Chinese cuisine. Chinese physicians of the time sometimes recommended against it due to the very real possibility of serious illness due to flukes and other parasitic organisms, however many prominent Chinese individuals (including Cao Zhi and Chen Deng) maintained a strong affinity for the dish. It was believed that the application of strongly flavored spices such as mustard or Sichuan pepper could render the dish safe to consume.
Consumption of "kuai" in China declined sharply by the time of the Qing Dynasty. Since that time, most Chinese food has been cooked, though a Chaozhou dish called "yusheng" uses raw fish as its primary ingredient.

Desiree Petersen is a professional wrestler. She was born in Copenhagen, Denmark and once held the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship.
Wrestling career.
In 1982, Desiree Petersen met Stu Hart. Hart would not train her, but referred her for training with The Fabulous Moolah. After training at Moolah's school, Petersen made her professional debut in January 1983 against Velvet McIntyre in British Columbia.
World Wrestling Federation.
In December 1984, Petersen replaced Princess Victoria as Velvet McIntyre's tag-team partner and was awarded the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship. From 1984-1985, Petersen competed in solo and tag-team matches against Moolah, Mad Maxine, Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, Penny Mitchell, Peggy Patterson, and Peggy Lee. During the first half of 1985, Petersen was engaged in a major solo feud against Martin, which was also spotlighted during her interview with Vince McMahon on "Tuesday Night Titans" in June 1985.
Petersen and McIntyre defended the titles until splitting up. A tag team title match between The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin) and champions McIntyre and Petersen was reported to have happened in Egypt in 1985, but in actuality, the match never took place. Kai and Martin were awarded the titles after McIntyre and Petersen split up when Petersen left the WWF in 1985.
Petersen returned to the WWF in 1988 and feuded with WWF Women's Champion Sherri Martel.

Walter Henry Mayson

Walter Henry Mayson (born November 8, 1835) was an English violin maker.
Biography.
Walter Henry Mayson was born in Cheetwood, then a small town about a mile and a half north of Manchester. He was the fourth child out of eleven with five brothers and four sisters. After a few years the Mayson family moved to Cheetham Hill, another two miles away from Manchester. Mrs. Mayson opened a school there with two of her sisters. Mayson was sent to the school and was taught by Thomas Whalley. 
At seventeen, Mayson was apprenticed at J. & A. Phillips & Co., a firm of merchants. His sister, Mary Ann, was married to a composer and organist, Joseph Thorne Harris of Manchester Cathedral, Manchester. Mayson spent all of his leisure time at his sister's house, where his love for music was encouraged. Told that his dead grandfather's fiddle was for sale, he struck a bargain with the owner, and started taking lessons. Mayson had by this time married Elizabeth Green, daughter of William Green the landscape painter.
On November 18, 1904, Mayson had a paralytic seizure. On December 26, he had another stroke and did not regain consciousness until his death on December 31.
Fiddle making.
At age 39, Mayson started to make fiddles. He took a room in Barton Arcade, Deansgate, Manchester where he produced 10 fiddles. His first customer, James Fildes, paid £10. During this period Mayson also wrote, and some of his songs and essays were published in Manchester newspapers. In 1899, he wrote a book called "Violin Making".

Neptune

Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the gaseous planets in the solar system, Neptune is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth but not as dense. On average, Neptune orbits the Sun at a distance of 30.1 AU, approximately 30 times the Earth–Sun distance. Named after the Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.
Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier, and its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. Neptune has been visited by one spacecraft, "Voyager 2", which flew by the planet on 25 August 1989.
Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and both have compositions which differ from those of the larger gas giants, Jupiter, and Saturn. Neptune's atmosphere, while similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in that it is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane. Astronomers sometimes categorise Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" in order to emphasise these distinctions. The interior of Neptune, like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of ices and rock. It is possible that the core has a solid surface, but the temperature would be thousands of degrees and the atmospheric pressure crushing. Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.
In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere is notable for its active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the 1989 "Voyager 2" flyby, the planet's southern hemisphere possessed a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as . Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching . Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately . Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labeled 'arcs'), which may have been detected during the 1960s but was only indisputably confirmed in 1989 by "Voyager 2".
History.
Discovery.
Galileo's drawings show that he first observed Neptune on 28 December 1612, and again on 27 January 1613. On both occasions, Galileo mistook Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared very close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. During the period of his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that very day. This apparent backward motion is created when the orbit of the Earth takes it past an outer planet. Since Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the star he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.
In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction. In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis, he requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.
In 1845–46, Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but also experienced difficulties in stimulating any enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June 1846, upon seeing Le Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.
Meantime, Le Verrier by letter urged Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. The very evening of the day of receipt of Le Verrier's letter on 23 September 1846, Neptune was discovered within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, and about 12° from Adams' prediction. Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice in August (Neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 August, but because Challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognised as a planet), failing to identify it owing to his casual approach to the work.
In the wake of the discovery, there was much nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who had priority and deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually an international consensus emerged that both Le Verrier and Adams jointly deserved credit. Since 1966 Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the "Neptune papers" (historical documents) to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. After reviewing the documents, they suggest that "Adams does not deserve equal credit with Le Verrier for the discovery of Neptune. That credit belongs only to the person who succeeded both in predicting the planet's place and in convincing astronomers to search for it."
Naming.
Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as "the planet exterior to Uranus" or as "Le Verrier's planet". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name "Janus". In England, Challis put forward the name "Oceanus".
Claiming the right to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly proposed the name "Neptune" for this new planet, while falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet "Le Verrier", after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name "Herschel" for "Uranus", after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and "Leverrier" for the new planet.
Struve came out in favour of the name "Neptune" on 29 December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Soon "Neptune" became the internationally accepted name. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which, except for Earth, were named for deities in Greek and Roman mythology.
Most languages today, even in countries that have no direct link to Greco-Roman culture, use some variant of the name "Neptune" for the planet; in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, the planet's name was literally translated as "sea king star" (), since Neptune was the god of the sea. In modern Greek, though, the planet is called "Poseidon" (Ποσειδώνας: "Poseidonas"), the Greek counterpart to Neptune.
Status.
From its discovery in 1846 until the subsequent discovery of Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. Upon Pluto's discovery Neptune became the penultimate planet, save for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer to the sun than Neptune. The discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet in its own right or part of the belt's larger structure. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word "planet" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a "dwarf planet" and making Neptune once again the last planet in the Solar System.
Composition and structure.
With a mass of 1.0243 kg, Neptune is an intermediate body between Earth and the larger gas giants: its mass is 17 times that of Earth but just 1/19th that of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is surpassed only by Jupiter. Neptune's equatorial radius of 24,764 km is nearly four times that of Earth. Neptune and Uranus are often considered a subclass of gas giant termed "ice giants", due to their smaller size and higher concentrations of volatiles relative to Jupiter and Saturn. In the search for extrasolar planets Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as "Neptunes", just as astronomers refer to various extra-solar bodies as "Jupiters".
Internal structure.
Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10 GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.
The mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane. As is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot, highly dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean. The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice. At a depth of 7000 km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones. Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of liquid diamond, with floating solid 'diamond-bergs'.
The core of Neptune is composed of iron, nickel and silicates, with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2 times that of Earth. The pressure at the centre is 7 Mbar (700 GPa), about twice as high as that at the centre of Earth, and the temperature may be 5,400 K.
Atmosphere.
At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane occur at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,
although Neptune's vivid azure differs from Uranus's milder cyan. Since Neptune's atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune's colour.
Neptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions; the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. The boundary between the two, the tropopause, occurs at a pressure of . The stratosphere then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10−5 to 10−4 microbars (1 to 10 Pa). The thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.
Models suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude. The upper-level clouds occur at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are believed to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about , where the temperature reaches . Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.
High-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150 km and lie about 50–110 km above the cloud deck. These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere, which is estimated to rise to 2,751 km from the surface of the water–ammonia ocean. This number is a third of its equatorial radius. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. Unlike Uranus, Neptune's composition has a higher volume of ocean, whereas Uranus has a smaller mantle.
Neptune's spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and acetylene. The stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.
For reasons that remain obscure, the planet's thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about 750 K. The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.
Magnetosphere.
Neptune also resembles Uranus in its magnetosphere, with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its rotational axis at 47° and offset at least 0.55 radii, or about 13500 km from the planet's physical centre. Before "Voyager 2"'s arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors. This field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of
electrically conducting liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water) resulting in a dynamo action.
The dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14 microteslas (0.14 G). The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2 T·m3 (14 μT·"R""N"3, where "R""N" is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.
Neptune's bow shock, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind, occurs at a distance of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and very likely much farther.
Planetary rings.
Neptune has a planetary ring system, though one much less substantial than that of Saturn. The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue. The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000 km from the centre of Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000 km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000 km. A faint outward extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000 km.
The first of these planetary rings was discovered in 1968 by a team led by Edward Guinan, but it was later thought that this ring might be incomplete. Evidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar occultation in 1984 when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on emersion. Images by "Voyager 2" in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings. These rings have a clumpy structure, the cause of which is not currently understood but which may be due to the gravitational interaction with small moons in orbit near them.
The outermost ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named "Courage", "Liberté", "Egalité 1", "Egalité 2" and "Fraternité" (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity). The existence of arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over very short timescales. Astronomers now believe that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring.
Earth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings are much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by "Voyager 2". In particular, it seems that the "Liberté" arc might disappear in as little as one century.
Climate.
One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the typical level of meteorological activity. When the "Voyager 2" spacecraft flew by Uranus in 1986, that planet was visually quite bland. In contrast Neptune exhibited notable weather phenomena during the 1989 "Voyager 2" fly-by.
Neptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s (1340 mph)—nearly attaining supersonic flow. More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20 m/s in the easterly direction to 325 m/s westward. At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from 400 m/s along the equator to 250 m/s at the poles. Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation. The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is believed to be a "skin effect" and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes. At 70° S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300 m/s.
The abundance of methane, ethane and ethyne at Neptune's equator is 10–100 times greater than at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles.
In 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K warmer than the rest of Neptune, which averages approximately . The warmth differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere lies frozen in Neptune's upper atmosphere, leak out as gas through the south pole and into space. The relative "hot spot" is due to Neptune's axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the Sun for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.
Because of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980 and is expected to last until about 2020. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.
Storms.
In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system spanning 13000×6600 km, was discovered by NASA's "Voyager 2" spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet's northern hemisphere.
The Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. Its nickname is due to the fact that when first detected in the months before the 1989 "Voyager 2" encounter it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot. Subsequent images revealed even faster clouds. The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It initially was completely dark, but as "Voyager 2" approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.
Neptune's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.
Internal heating.
Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is believed to be due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies half again as far from the Sun as Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of . At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals , the temperature is . Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; while Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.
Orbit and rotation.
The average distance between Neptune and the Sun is (about 30.1 AU), and it completes an orbit on average every 164.79 years, subject to a variability of around ±0.1 years.
On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in our sky, because the Earth was in a different location in its 365.25-day orbit. Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.
The elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77° compared to the Earth. Because of an eccentricity of 0.011, the distance between Neptune and the Sun varies by 101 million km between perihelion and aphelion, the nearest and most distant points of the planet from the Sun along the orbital path, respectively.
The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°, which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, this planet experiences similar seasonal changes. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years. Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11 hours. Since its axial tilt is comparable to the Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.
Because Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18 hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12 hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.
Orbital resonances.
Neptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30 AU out to about 55 AU from the Sun. Much in the same way that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42 AU is an example.
There do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the Solar System. These resonances occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known objects, is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects, Pluto, is among them. Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide. The 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated.
Neptune possesses a number of trojan objects occupying the Sun-Neptune Lagrangian point—a gravitationally stable region leading it in its orbit. Neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1:1 resonance with Neptune. Some Neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits, and are likely to have formed alongside Neptune rather than being captured. The first and so far only object identified as associated with Neptune's trailing Lagrangian point is 2008 LC18. Neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite, . The object has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years. It is likely a captured object.
Formation and migration.
The formation of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their creation. One is that the ice giants were not created by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.
An alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is currently favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.
Moons.
Neptune has 14 known moons. The largest by far, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune and the only one massive enough to be spheroidal, is Triton, discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit. In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the solar system, with estimated temperatures of .
Neptune's second known satellite (by order of discovery), the irregular moon Nereid, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the solar system. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from Neptune.
From July to September 1989, "Voyager 2" discovered six new Neptunian moons. Of these, the irregularly shaped Proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity. Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons—Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea—orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. The next-farthest out, Larissa, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when "Voyager 2" observed Neptune in 1989, it was found to have been caused by the moon. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004. A new moon and the smallest yet, S/2004 N 1, was found in 2013. Since Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, the planet's moons have been named after lesser sea gods.
Observation.
Neptune is never visible to the naked eye, having a brightness between magnitudes +7.7 and +8.0, which can be outshone by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno and 6 Hebe. A telescope or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.
Because of the distance of Neptune from the Earth, the angular diameter of the planet only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4 arcseconds, the smallest of the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size has made it challenging to study visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics.
From the Earth, Neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every 367 days, resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each opposition. These loops carried it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and again in October and November 2011.
Observation of Neptune in the radio-frequency band shows that the planet is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts. Both sources are believed to originate from the planet's rotating magnetic field. In the infrared part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily tracked.
Exploration.
"Voyager 2"'s closest approach to Neptune occurred on 25 August 1989. Because this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for "Voyager 1"'s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from "Voyager 2" became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, "Neptune All Night".
During the encounter, signals from the spacecraft required 246 minutes to reach Earth. Hence, for the most part, the "Voyager 2" mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune encounter. The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon Nereid before it came within 4400 km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25 August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon Triton later the same day.
The spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around Uranus. The question of the planet's rotation period was settled using measurements of radio emissions. "Voyager 2" also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.
In 2003, there was a proposal in NASA's "Vision Missions Studies" for a "Neptune Orbiter with Probes" mission that does "Cassini"-level science. The work is being done in conjunction with JPL and the California Institute of Technology. Another, more recent proposal was for Argo, a flyby spacecraft that would visit Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and a Kuiper belt object. However, the focus would be on Neptune and its largest moon Triton to help plug a predicted 50-year gap in exploration of the system. New Horizons 2 might have also done a flyby.

Statham's Quarry

Statham's Quarry (also known as Darling Range Quarry, and then Perth City Council's Darling Range Quarry after 1920) is the site of a quarry on the Darling Scarp on the southern side of the entrance of the Helena River valley on to the Swan Coastal Plain in Perth, Western Australia. It is located in Gooseberry Hill and is within the bounds of the Gooseberry Hill National Park
History.
Statham's Quarry is considered a rare example of a stone quarry which has retained physical evidence of its operations and is associated with the development of the quarry industry in Western Australia. 
The quarry was established by Thomas Statham and William Burton in 1894 until Statham's death in 1920.
The Perth City Council operated the quarry following Statham's death and material from the quarry was used to as street paving in Perth during the early 1900s. The rocks for the groyne at City Beach also came from the quarry 
There was also a clay quarry operation known as Statham's in Glen Forrest which was a brickworks.
The quarry is the claimed location of one of the most extensive dolerite dykes on the Darling Scarp.
The quarry was serviced by the Kalamunda Zig Zag section of the Upper Darling Range Railway during the time of its operation (which closed in 1949), and was finally put out of operation by a bushfire in 1957. The location has been susceptible to bushfires, the most recent being in the early 2000s which was severe and very hot, reducing the ground cover around the quarry and adjacent country severely.
Current usage.
The main current usage of the quarry is rock climbing and abseiling, with the Department of Environment and Conservation providing facilities and maintaining the site. Dangerous areas are signed and fenced off.
The quarry's importance as a safe easily accessible and well maintained climbing and abseiling location close to the metropolitan area of Perth can be found in the climbing records.

Habang May Buhay

Habang May Buhay (lit. "While There is Life") is a medical drama series that aired on ABS-CBN. This is the story of a strong-willed nurse who undergoes family, career, and love challenges in the Philippines and the United States.
Overview.
Genre.
"Habang May Buhay" is the first-ever Filipino "nurse-serye" set in the dramatic setting of a hospital (and various prisons) that mirrors life at its most intense. This series will also bring back the arch-rivalry of Judy Ann Santos and Gladys Reyes from the big hit teleserye, "Mara Clara".
Synopsis.
Jane’s childhood dreams to become a nurse to help her mother, who is also a nurse, will be shattered by one tragic incident caused by someone she truly loved. From then on, Jane vowed to heal her mother and seek truth and justice for her mother’s heartbreaking state above anything else. Jane vowed to never love and trust again. As time passes, Jane struggles to heal her mother and become the nurturing nurse that her mother hoped her to be. And Jane’s journey into the Filipino medical world leads her to meet David – the arrogant heir to the hospital, who becomes her worst enemy but secretly pines for, and Raon, the street urchin whom she constantly saves and heals.Will Jane heal in time to love again? 
Plot.
The series opens with a terrible vehicle accident. Luckily, Nurse Rose Caparas (Gina Alajar) and her young daughter Jane aka Jing-Jing, are there to aid those who are hurt from the terrible wreck. Rose has a secret affair with a general physician, Dr. Manuel Corpuz (John Arcilla); Manuel's wife, Ellen (Tetchie Agbayani), is aware of her husband's infidelity and tries to unravel the identity of her husband's mistress. Jane befriends Sam and his adopted brother Nathan, the two children of Manuel and Ellen. Sam instantly falls for Jane and apparently so does Nathan; the three of them form a bond and promise to be friends forever. However, an unexpected revelation breaks their pact. One fateful day, Nathan sees his father Manuel kissing Rose and catches this moment on film. Sam becomes furious upon seeing the photo of his father's unfaithfulness and quickly jumps to conclusions. Out of rage, Sam and Nathan confront Rose. Rose tries to explain herself but Sam accidentally pushes her off a cliff, setting the story in motion. Upon learning the crime their sons have committed, Ellen convinces Manuel to go abroad for their family's safety. Nathan, however, is unable to travel abroad due to complications with his adoption papers. This causes Nathan and Sam to get separated - with Sam traveling to America with his parents and Nathan running away. Nathan changes his name to Raon, in hopes of forgetting about his past. While in the states, Ellen and Manuel continue to have marital problems, forcing them to get separated. Later on, Ellen marries a rich doctor named Martin Briones and also inherits a stepdaughter, Clarissa Briones. As an act of embracing his new future and letting go of the tragedy of his past, Sam changes his name to David Briones. Meanwhile, Rose's accident leaves her mentally ill, leaving her and Jane no other choice but to live under the care of Rose's bitter cousin and Jane's aunt, Aida (Jobelle Salvador). After Rose attacks Aida, Aida decides to have Rose locked up in a mental institution, much to young Jane's chagrin. While under the care of her cruel aunt, Jane befriends Nonoy, a young boy who hopes to reconcile with his long lost mother. Jane and Nonoy would visit Rose at the mental institution at every chance they get, but another unfortunate event causes Jane's friendship with Nonoy to end abruptly. Jane, therefore, uses all the pain she had endured as her motivation to reach her dreams of becoming a nurse and to one day restore her mother.
Unbeknownst to Jane, her other aunt named Cora (Rio Locsin) is also looking for Jane and her mother in order to help them; as a promise to Jane's father. Cora sends money to Jane and Rose, ignorant of the former and the latter's situation with Aida. Instead of giving the money to Jane, Aida takes it for herself and her daughter, Grace. The all-grown-up Jane (Judy Ann Santos) finishes high school, and luckily she gets a college scholarship for the course she has always dreamed of—nursing. Since her wicked aunt opts to deprive her even with tertiary education, Jane has to work her way to college. Regularly, she still visits her mentally challenged mother in the mental institution. After an altercation with Grace over stolen money, Jane accidentally discovers all the letters her Aunt Cora had sent. Completely raged, Jane finally decides to move out from Aida's care and move in under Cora's wing. Now that everything is starting to fall into its rightful place, tragedy then strikes. On the day they are about to release Rose from the mental institution, the deranged lady runs off. Jane eventually graduates and becomes the nurse that she hoped she would be. As a nurse, Jane is very dedicated, strong-willed, and selfless. However, all of this is challenged when she meets David Briones (Derek Ramsay) - the arrogant and womanizing owner of the hospital Jane works for. Both Jane and David are unaware of each other's true identity. Meanwhile, Raon (Joem Bascon), finds Rose and does everything in his power to try to restore her back to her normal state. Overtime, Jane and David grow close, despite their constant annoyance of one another. Though none are willing to admit it, Jane and David have fallen in love with one another but are still ignorant from the truth. Trouble, however, comes in the form of Clarissa Briones (Gladys Reyes), David's stepsister who also harbors deep romantic feelings for David. In his attempt to heal Rose, Raon runs into his father Manuel at a community hospital but does not reveal his true identity to the doctor. Manuel and Rose are reunited, with Manuel acting as Rose's doctor. Jane and David become an official couple, but Clarissa continues with her constant meddling.
Raon learns that Jane is Rose's daughter and therefore hatches a plan to reunite the mother and daughter who were torn apart by tragedy. Now that two are reunited, Jane finds Manuel at the hospital and tries to talk to him. However, the troubled doctor still does not have the courage to face Jane and does everything he can to hide from her until the time is right. On the other hand, David finally discovers Jane's true identity after he pays a visit to Jane's mother (not knowing that her mother is Rose). Upon seeing David, Rose tells Jane that David is the one that pushed her down the cliff. Jane dismisses the truth by telling her mother that the person responsible is Sam, not David. David, now hurting from what he discovered, tries to find a way to tell Jane his secret: That he is in fact Sam and the one responsible for her mother's accident. Clarissa, on the other hand, is still trying to come up with plans to rid Jane from David's life.
David's mother, Ellen, becomes aware of David's relationship with Jane and opposes this, all thanks to Clarissa. Ellen, therefore, returns to the Philippines to take matters into her own hands. David tells his mother that Jane is Rose's daughter and that she mustn't do anything to jeopardize their relationship because if she does, David will never speak to her again. Clarissa overhears their conversation and later threatens Ellen that she will expose the truth to Jane; Ellen retracts by telling Clarissa that she, too, will expose something from Clarissa's past that will put her in jail if she ever tells Jane the truth. Jane's friend, Nonoy (Will Devaughn), suddenly returns to Jane's life, causing much jealousy within David. Happy to be reunited with her long lost friend, Jane is unaware of the fact that Nonoy is sick. Ellen is also reunited with Manuel, after a run-in with each other at the community hospital. Manuel wants nothing more to do with his ex-wife, but Ellen plans on winning back Manuel. Ellen soon discovers that Rose is still alive after following Manuel on his way to see Rose. To ensure that nothing can get in between her and Manuel, Ellen kidnaps Rose and takes her somewhere far away where Manuel won't be able to reach her.

Church of St. Donatus

The Church of St. Donatus is a church located in Zadar, Croatia. Its name refers to Donatus of Zadar, who began construction on this church in the 9th century and ended it on the northeastern part of the Roman forum. Originally named (and dedicated to) the "church of the Holy Trinity", in the 15th century it was renamed the Church of St. Donatus.
Church of St. Donatus is the largest Pre-romanesque building in Croatia. It is also one of the most impressive churches of centralised type of the Carolingian period in Europe.
History.
The beginning of the building of the Church of St. Donatus was placed to the second half of 8th century, and it is supposed to be completed in 9th century. The Zadar bishop and diplomat Donat (8th and 9th centuries) is credited with the building of the church. He led the representations of the Dalmatian cities to Byzantium and Charles the Great, which is why this church is similar to charles' court chapels, especially the one in Aachen, and also to St. Vitale's Church in Ravenna. It belongs to the pre-Romanesque architectural period, being an original variation of the architectural form used in the Byzantine buildings of the 9th century. 
The circular church, formerly domed, is 27 m high and it's characterised by simplicity and technical primitivism. It has three radially situated apses and an ambulatory around the central area, surmounted by circular gallery. The circular shape is typical of the early Byzantine age in Dalmatia. It was built on the Roman forum and materials from buildings used in its construction. Among the fragments which are built into the foundations it is still possible to distinsh the remains of a sacrificial altar on which is written IVNONI AVGUSTE IIOVI AVGUSTO.
Its use has varied during its lifetime; during the rule of the Venetians and Turks it was a warehouse, and also during the French occupation and when under the Austrians. After the liberation it was an archeological museum for a short period of time and it now serves as the concert venue for the annual International Festival of Medieval Renaissance Music, also known as Musical Evenings in St. Donatus because of its stark interior and excellent acoustics.

Inowłódz

Inowłódz is a village in Tomaszów Mazowiecki County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Inowłódz. It lies approximately east of Tomaszów Mazowiecki and south-east of the regional capital Łódź. The village has a population of 795.
History.
Inowłódz is one of the oldest towns in Poland. It was first mentioned in documents from 1145, and by then, it already had a public house, a church, a fair, and a custom house, located on the Pilica crossing. The river itself marks here the border between two historic provinces of Poland - Lesser Poland and the Land of Leczyca. Furthermore, a few kilometers to the northeast lies the province of Mazovia.
In the early days of the Kingdom of Poland, the Inowłódz river crossing was an important element of an international merchant route from Torun towards the Kingdom of Hungary. The village was granted Magdeburg rights in the mid-14th century, but exact date is not known. Inowłódz quickly developed, and in the 14th and 15th centuries was an important center of brewing and grain commerce. In 1370, the town was surrounded by a defensive wall, and a castle, which was the seat of a starosta, was built. THe Inowłódz stronghold was a part of the defensive system of the Kingdom of Poland.
The period of prosperity ended during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660), when Inowłódz was destroyed by Swedish soldiers. In September 1655, a skirmish between Swedes and Polish division of Stefan Czarniecki took place here. Together with the town, Swedish invaders destroyed the castle, after which the starostas had to live in a small house in the town. In the 18th century, Inowłódz became a center of industry, with iron works and lime excavation. After the Partitions of Poland, the town belonged to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland (1815 - 1915), and following the January Uprising, lost its town charter (1870).
In the late 19th century, Inowłódz became a spa, popular among residents of Lodz and Warsaw. In 1884, a spa center with guest houses and bath was opened by Bernard Birenzweig, and among the visitors was Julian Tuwim, who liked to come here for the summer vacation. The development of the Inowłódz spa ended during World War I, when the village found itself on the frontline in December 1914, and was almost completely destroyed, together with the bridge over the Pilica. In the Second Polish Republic, Inowłódz belonged to Lodz Voivodeship, and in 1939 (see Invasion of Poland), the area of the village once again saw heavy fighting, between the Wehrmacht, advancing towards Warsaw, and the Polish Prusy Army. In early 1940, the unit of Major Henryk Dobrzanski operated here, the symbolic tomb of Dobrzanski is 5 kilometers from Inowłódz.
Sights.
The history of Roman Catholic church of Saint Giles probably dates back to the year 1082. Most likely however, the church was founded during the reign of Boleslaw Krzywousty, in the 1130s. At the same time, a fortified monastery of Benedictine nuns was built by the church. The monastery was destroyed in 1241, during the Mongol invasion of Poland. In 1520, the church of St. Michael was built, which brought about the decline of the Saint Giles church. In 1790, the ancient church was renovated, but three years later, it was ransacked by Prussian soldiers, and turned into a grain storage. The Saint Giles church was completely renovated in the Second Polish Republic, on initiative of President Ignacy Moscicki. First service took place on November 1, 1938.

I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song

"I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song" is the title of a posthumously-released single by the American singer-songwriter Jim Croce. The song was written by Croce and was originally found on his album "I Got a Name".
Croce was killed in a small-plane crash in September 1973, the same week that a 45RPM single, the title cut from his studio album "I Got a Name" was released. Following the delayed release of a song from his previous album ("Time in a Bottle") in late 1973, "I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song" was chosen as the second single released from the his final studio album. It peaked at #9 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in April 1974, becoming his fifth Top 10 hit. In addition, the song went to #1 on the "Billboard" adult contemporary chart and reached #68 on the "Billboard" country music chart, Croce's only song to chart there.
Croce wrote the song in early 1973 when he arrived home and got into a disagreement with his wife, Ingrid. Instead of arguing with her, she has stated that Croce "went downstairs, and he started to play, like he always did when he wrote...the next morning, he came up early in the morning and sang it to me."
This song is noted for the use of male backup singers, as well as a string section, that plays a counterpoint melody during the concluding instrumental.
Songwriting.
Croce's wife Ingrid Croce has an autobiographical cookbook, "Thyme In A Bottle," in which she writes interesting anecdotes about Jim. She wrote about "I'll Have To Say 'I Love You' in a Song":
"One weekend, after being on the road for many months, Jim got a chance to come home to relax with his family. We settled in to enjoy our time alone together. Though Jim was expecting company the next day, avoiding confrontation he never told me that we were to be joined by an entire film crew! The next morning, 15 people from Acorn Productions descended upon our house to record a promotional film of Jim Croce at Home on the Farm.
"I prepared breakfast, lunch and dinner for the whole film crew and after the group left, I questioned Jim about our finances. After a year and a half of his working so very hard on the road, we were barely making ends meet, but Jim wouldn't talk about it. He hated questions as much as he hated confrontation, especially about money. He stormed out of our bedroom and went down to the kitchen table to brood. The next morning he woke me gently by singing his new song. 'Every time I tried to tell you the words just came out wrong. So I'll have to say "I love you" in a song.'"

In other words, KDRM administers seven main and thirty-nine subsidiary laws. Apart from this,KDRM implements eighteen laws for other government agencies. KDRM is now known as JKDM (Jabatan Kastam Diraja Malaysia) when Dato' Sri Hj. Ibrahim bin Jaapar takes over as Director General of Customs in 2009.
History.
Early History Of Tax Administration.
Before any Western powers ever set foot in this land, a tax administration system had actually existed, that is during the heyday of the Melaka and Johor-Riau Sultanate.
In the era of the Melaka Sultanate, maritime and harbour laws existed along with matters pertaining to a tax structure involving the foreign and local merchants. During that period the tax collector and all tax-related matters were the responsibility of the Chief of the Exchequer:
'"" ... the Chief of the Exchequer. (He) controlled all the revenue and Customs Officers and looked after the palace building and equipment".
(R.J.W. Wilkinson "The Melaka Sultanate". JMBRAS VOL. XIII-Pt.2, 1935, p. 31)."'
The portfolio in charge of tax collection was the Harbour Master. He was entrusted by the king with the power to enforce rules and Harbour Laws.
Tax Administration In The Straits Settlements And Federated Malay States.
With the establishment of the Straits Settlements (which consisted of Singapore, Penang, Melaka, Labuan and Dinding in Perak) in 1826, tax administration were supervised by a Governor and a Council directly answerable to the Governor General in Calcutta, India who was in turn controlled by the Board of Governors of the East India Company.
Even though the Straits Settlements had been established, a few tax structure and practices applied by the Malay chieftains were retained, for example the Tax Farming system. In this system, a lessee with the highest bid had the authority to collect tax. The lessee was given a license and was subject to specific rules. This facilitated the process of obtaining Excise Duty revenues.
To prevent smuggling, particularly opium, from 1861 onwards the number of police personnel were reinforced and new recruits swelled the ranks.
Even though a Customs and Excise Department had yet to exist, all customs activities were operated by a body called the Government Monopolies. This body was authorised to grant import license and process and sell certain goods such as opium, tobacco, arrack, cigarettes and matches.
At that time, excise duty were imposed on such goods as rice-wine (samsu), toddy and locally made opium whilst customs tax was imposed on opium imported from China, tobacco, cigarettes, liquor and fire crackers.
Government Monopolies, the body that controlled these customs and excise activities existed until 1937 whereby in that year the Straits Settlement Customs and Excise Department was officially launched as H.M. Customs and Excise. Following that, a Revenue Collection Branch and a Preventive Branch were set up to oversee customs and excise activities until 1937.
A station called the Coast Post was set up to place Customs Officers (at that time called Revenue Officers) who will collect tax and monitor commercial / trading activities. The Customs Department collaborated with the Harbour Master, Post Master and Immigration Department to ensure a smooth day to day operations.
In 1938 ship raiding were introduced to curb smuggling activities.
H.M. Customs and Excise continued until 1948 up to the extant of the Malayan Union era whereby the Federation of Malaya Customs and Excise Department were then established, covering the entire Malay Peninsula (except Singapore).
Taxation Systems In The Federated Malay States.
Before British intervention in the Malay States and before the Resident System was introduced, there existed a tax administration in Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan managed by the Malay chieftains. At that time, the Malay States were divided into several provinces or districts with a chieftain authorised to collect tax over the people. Among the taxes imposed were:
Rubber $1.00 per pikul
Animal skin $12.50 per pikul
Tin $4.00 per bahara
Rice $16.00 per koyan
Tobacco $2.00 per pikul
Opium $4.00 per pikul
Oil 10% each type
The British had taken over tax collection from the local chieftains with the introduction of the Resident system from 1870 to 1880s. Before the formation of State Councils in the states governed by the Resident System, tax collection relied on the discretion of each Resident who is also the Sultan’s Advisor. The State Council subsequently would determine all matters related to Customs tax in the states. Among the functions of the Council were:
" ... Connection with the Government of the country influential natives and others with whom the Government may consult, regarding proposals for taxation, appointments, concessions, the institution or abolition of laws and other matters ...;"
Among the new taxes were:
Tin mines lease system with an export tax of $15.00 per bahara and 1/10 for other metals.
Farming revenue -2.5% tax.
Tax on imported opium.
Systematic tax administration activities in the Malay States led to the establishment of the Customs Department. Customs stations were situated at river estuaries and state borders and were in charge of collecting duties on agricultural products, mining, alcoholic beverages, opium and gambier. The management system of the Customs Department varied from state to state.
The management of the department and tax collection were carried out by the clerks in the District Office and State Treasury Office; therefore the Customs Department did not fully manage customs and excise duty. For example in Telok Anson, Taiping and Kuala Lumpur, tax were collected by the Government Treasurer, whilst at the ports, river estuaries as well as the borders of Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan, tax collection were done by Customs Clerks who were directly responsible to the District Officers in those areas. In Selangor import tax on opium were collected by the Chinese People Affairs Protection Officers.
Customs Union in the Malay States had not existed then. This led to complication in enforcing tariff on goods and differing tax rate in the different states. As a consequence there was a need to form a federation between the Malay States and this basically had been approved by the British Foreign Secretary and Straits Settlements Governor.
With the formation of the Federated Malay States, there were efforts to integrate Customs matters between states. As an outcome, in 1904, a new legislation called the Goods Revenue Enactment Number II was enacted, with the purpose of controlling all Import tax revenue on alcoholic beverages. Under this legislation, the retailer was given a special license to import alcoholic beverages with a fixed rent payment.
On 1 January 1907, a new post of Inspector of Trade and Customs was created. On the same date, a legislation called The Customs Regulations Enactment was introduced with the approval of all four States Legislative Board. In 1908 the title of Inspector of Trade and Customs had been changed to Commissioner of Trade and Customs.
With the existence of this enactment, import and export tax schedules became uniform in the Federated Malay States. A complete integration occurred in 1920 with the establishment of one uniform Customs enactment for the Federated Malay States.
With this integration, Customs stations at the borders were abolished and no tax was imposed if the goods brought from a state to another were from the union. To collect export duty on goods that were brought out by trains, tax collecting stations were established in Singapore in 1918, Prai (1919) and Melaka (1922). The stations were also tasked with collecting duties on imported goods.
The establishment of the Customs Union in the Federated Malay States had harmonised all Customs regulations between the states. In fact, all Customs offices under the Trade Commissioner and Customs Department were responsible directly to the Chief Secretary of the Federated Malay States.
In 1938, the title Commissioner of Trade and Customs was changed to Comptroller of Customs.
The Establishment Of Customs Union In The Malay Peninsula.
In 1931 during the Federated Malay States Rulers Conference or Durbar in Sri Menanti, Negeri Sembilan, the British High Commissioner, Sir Cecil Clementi proposed an expansion of the union. The proposition was based on the annual increase of import tax.
Until the year 1932, Customs Tariff had already encompassed a majority of goods and preferential duty had to be created for goods coming from the British empire. The heavy reliance on import duty as a source of revenue for the Federated Malay States led Sir Cecil to opine:
"Like the rest of the British Empire, the Malay States had become increasingly dependent on Customs import duties as their main source of revenue, and it was on this score that he strongly recommended the creation of a customs union embracing the whole of the Malay peninsula if trade is not to be intolerably cramped, and the interdependence of one territory upon another in matter of commerce ".(C.R. Emerson, Malaysia a study in Direct and Indirect Role, Out 1979, p. 190).
Henceforth he suggested an establishment of a Customs Union for the whole of the Malay Peninsula. This was so that the tariff growth in the Federated Malay States would not disturb the smooth trade transactions in the states.
However, the Customs Union for the Malay Peninsula could only be established in 1946, that is with the formation of the Malayan Union in April, 1946, and the department was given the name Customs and Excise of Malayan Union. Nevertheless, with the dissolution of the Malayan Union in 1948, this department was reorganised. The Customs Department then did not consist only of those under the Federated Malay States but it also included those under the administration of the Non-Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements.
The Establishment Of The Customs And Excise Department Of The Federation Of Malaya.
In 1948, with the formation of the Federation of Malaya, the Customs and Excise Department were established for the whole of the Malay Peninsula. Under the Customs Ordinance 1952, this department was put under the control of the High Commissioner for Malaya and headed by a Comptroller of Customs as can be found since 1938. This lasted until the country achieved its independence in 1957.
Section 138, Customs Ordinance, 1952 gave the Federation Council power to issue all rules and regulations on Customs affairs. The Customs main area at that time was the whole of Malaya excluding Penang (to maintain its free port status).
As a result from the formation of the Customs Union in the Malay States in 1948, there was a dire need to boost staff performance to fulfill the needs of the country which was on her way to independence. In 1956 a training center was formed in Bukit Baru, Melaka.
When the Federation of Malaya achieved its independence on 31 August 1957, the organisational structure of the Customs and Excise Department was reshuffled again to fulfill the needs of an independent Malaya. Customs and Excise Department administration was assigned under the Finance Ministry led by a Customs and Excise Comptroller who was responsible to the Finance Minister.
The department was divided into three zones based on three main trading centers. For the Northern Zone the base was in Penang and covered Kedah, Perlis and Perak. The Central Zone was based in Kuala Lumpur and its area encompassed Terengganu, Kelantan and Negeri Sembilan. Lastly, the Southern Zone comprised the remaining states of Johor, Pahang, Melaka and the Customs station in Singapore. Each Zone was led by a Senior Assistant Comptroller of Customs.
Development, Progression of Royal Malaysian Customs and Excise Department.
On September 16, 1963, the structure of the Customs and Excise Department administration was reshuffled again with the inclusion of Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore into Malaysia. The Customs department was divided into three main territories, that is the Peninsular Malaysia (West Malaysia), Sabah and Sarawak, where each territory were led by a Regional Comptroller of Customs and Excise.
On Tuesday, October 29, 1963, in the Dewan Tunku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, an auspicious event unfurled as the Customs and Excise Department was conferred the title Diraja / Royal by HRH Seri Paduka Baginda Di Pertuan Agong. This was an honor from the Government for the Department’s untold contribution to the country. It was a momentous occasion in the history of the Royal Customs and Excise of Malaysia.
Amendment to the Customs Ordinance 1952, enforced on 1 October 1964, had annulled the posts of Revenue Officer and Junior Customs Officer, and in its stead new posts were introduced called Customs Officer, Senior Customs Officer and Chief Customs Officer. Beside that, this amendment also created the posts of Assistant Superintendent of Customs and Superintendent of Customs.
1964 also saw an all local selection of Customs Officers upon service completion of the last two English officials.
Even though the Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak were contained in Malaysia, each state still worked under separate Customs Ordinances and Duty Orders. These affected the movement of goods from one territory to the other thus creating a bumpy journey through the different bureaucracies. Following these difficulties the Comptrollers from the three territories met in mid 1967.
A result of the meeting was the enactment of the Customs Act No. 62, 1967 that gave the whole of Malaysia a single Customs law. Consequently, the Indirect Tax Committee of the Treasury actively prepared a collective tariff for the three zones.
In 1972, the Royal Customs and Excise Malaysia were involved in a restructuring exercise following a report by an expert from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On 1 August 1972, the title for the head of Customs Department was changed to Director General of Customs and Excise; and two new posts were created, that is the Deputy Director General of Customs (Implementation) and Deputy Director General of Customs (Management). From that date onwards, the position of Regional Comptroller of Customs and Excise (West Malaysia) was abolished and replaced with one Regional Customs Director each for the three areas, North, Central and South which were previously led by a Senior Assistant Customs Director.
In 1972, a revenue legislation called the Sales Tax Act 1972 was declared in the Government Gazette as Malaysia Law Act 64 and implemented on February 29, 1972. This tax, known as Sales Tax, was imposed on all imported and local products, except those exempted under Sales Tax (Exemption) Order 1972, or were produced by manufacturers exempted from being licensed under Sale Tax (Licence Exemption) Order 1972.
Accordingly in 1975, the Government introduced yet another law called the Service Tax Act 1975. This enabled the Department to collect service tax from business premises that provided services and goods which were taxed under the Second Schedule, Service Tax Regulations, 1975.
The enforcement of the Motor Vehicle Levy Act taking effect on the 1st January 1984 also contributed towards increasing the department’s revenue collection. With the enforcement, all motor vehicles ferrying certain goods either leaving or entering the country, notwithstanding laden or empty, (unless those exempted) will be levied.
Until the year 1977, even though Malaysia had existed for 14 years, there were still a few minor legislations in the three Customs controlled territories which operated separately. Research was done so that only one legislation is used in the regions of the Malay Peninsula, Sabah and Sarawak. The movement was called the Harmonisation Movement. The first benefit reaped was that movement of goods from one territory to another will no longer be considered as import or export; and goods will only be taxed once, that is when the goods were imported or exported for the first time from Malaysia. This means business transactions between territories can proceed unhindered.
On 19 December 1977, Penang was declared as a Main Customs Area. With that, Penang’s free port status was withdrawn. The year also saw the Department embracing the International Unit System or SI, converting everything into metric by the 1 January 1978 through the Customs Duty Order1978.
The Customs Department had another restructuring exercise in 1979. Whilst continuing to be helmed by the Director General of Customs, he was now assisted by three Deputy Director Generals who would be responsible for the Implementation, Prevention as well as Management and Policy programmes. Organisational structure at the headquarters level was arranged based on regional activity whereby each activity was headed by a Director of Customs. The activities were the Prevention Division, Customs, Internal Tax, Research, Planning and Training, Revenue Collection as well as General Administration and Finance. The same applied at state level where each state in Malaysia were led by a Director of Customs. In addition, the department also had a station in Singapore administered by a Federation Customs Tax Collector.
In 1983 history was made when, for the first time ever, the Royal Malaysian Customs and Excise Department celebrated World Customs Day. The date January 26 was chosen to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Customs Cooperation Council ( now known as the World Customs Organization or WCO for short). The first Customs Day celebration was inaugurated by the Honourable Minister of Finance on the compound of the Royal Customs and Excise Malaysia Training College (now Royal Malaysian Customs Academy).
1987 saw Langkawi declared detached from the Main Customs Area and made the second free port in Malaysia after Labuan. Free port status was conferred on the island beginning 1 January 1987 to encourage tourism in Langkawi (which had not been developed accordingly) wherewith it would increase the standard of living of the local people.
To equip the Department with the required work force, the Royal Malaysian Customs College was established in August 1956 (formerly known as the Federal Customs Training Center, Federal Customs Training School and Royal Customs Training College).
After several years of going through the research and planning process, in 1989 the college was expanded. Now it is known as the Royal Malaysian Customs Academy (Akademi Kastam Diraja Malaysia or AKMAL, meaning ‘perfect’).
Beginning 1 January 1990 another event was chalked in the Customs annals, state of Perlis was given a new Customs administration independently. Previously, the Perlis Customs came under the auspices of the State Customs Director of Kedah and Perlis with Alor Setar, in Kedah as the headquarters. With the establishment of the new Customs administration, all activities and Customs affairs could be run more smoothly in the state of Perlis.
In 1995, the Royal Malaysian Customs and Excise Department once again reorganised its structure. At the top level management, the status quo was retained whereby the Director General of Customs, aided by his three deputies, spearheaded the Implementation, Prevention and Management Programme. A new programme was introduced called the Corporate Planning and Development Programme. However this programme could only be found at the Headquarters level. In tandem with that, Customs activities in the Headquarters were arranged thus:
(i) Customs, Internal Tax and Technique Service- under the Implementation Programme.
(ii) Preventive - under the Preventive Programme.
(iii)Personnel and Administrative, Finance and Procurement, Management Information System and Revenue Accounting - under the Management Programme.
(iv)Corporate Planning and AKMAL- under the Corporate Planning and Development Programme.
Each of these activities is led by a Director of Customs. The post of State Director of Customs in the states remained. The same goes for the Federal Customs Tax Collector in Singapore and Customs Advisory Minister in Brussels, Belgium. Beside that, to create a greater impact for the Department, the Public Relations Unit, Internal Audit Unit and Legal Affairs are assigned directly under the Director General of Customs.
On October 23, 1998, the Right Honourable Prime Minister who was also the Minister of Finance I, in his speech for the Budget of 1999 in the Dewan Rakyat, announced a levy on windfall profit imposed beginning 1 January 1999 to help the government secure added revenue. Windfall profit is a surplus profit whereby a higher selling price occurred as a consequence of the Ringgit depreciation riding on the backlash of the economic crisis that hit the country since the middle of 1997. The first commodity to be slapped by this levy is crude palm oil where levy is imposed when the price exceeds RM2, 000 per tonne.

Louis Chedid (born 1 January 1948, in Ismaïlia) is a French singer-songwriter of Lebanese origin.
Biography.
Louis Chedid is the son of the writer Andrée Chedid and the father of Matthieu Chedid (better known as -M-).
As a child he made his first footsteps into the singing world as a member of the "Manécanterie des Petits Chanteurs à la Croix de Bois", a famous French catholic boys choir.
Chedid was a fan of the jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt and decided that he would set forth into a career in the world of music as soon as he left school. After his first album "Balbutiements" (Mumblings – 1973) attracted little attention, his talent was first recognised after the release of titles like "La Belle" and "T'as beau pas être beau" released in 1977.
In 1981, "Ainsi soit-il" (Amen) rose to the top of the charts, followed four years later by "Anne ma sœur Anne" (My sister Anne) which criticised the increasing popularity of the extreme-right in France. His first, autobiographical novel – 40 Berges Blues – was published in 1992. 
Chedid is also the composer of Pierre-Dominique Burgaud's "Le Soldat Rose" (The Pink Soldier, 2006), a fairytale musical whose songs have been interpreted by singers including -M-, Vanessa Paradis, Jeanne Cherhal, Francis Cabrel, Alain Souchon and Bénabar.

Yoon Suk-Min (Hangul: 윤석민, Hanja: 尹錫珉) (born July 24, 1986) is a South Korean starting pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball. He previously played the Kia Tigers in the Korea Baseball Organization. He bats and throws right-handed. 
Yoon is a 6 ft 0 in, 180 lb right-handed pitcher. With a three-quarters delivery Yoon throws a fastball at 90-92 mph (tops out at 96 mph), a change-up, an occasional curveball, and a hard-breaking, mid-80s slider. With a shoulder injury his fastball dipped into high-80s, and he converted to relief during the 2013 season.
Professional career.
Kia Tigers (2005–2013).
Selected by the Kia Tigers with the 1st pick in the 2nd round of the KBO draft, Yoon made his pro debut with the Tigers on April 2, 2005. In his rookie season, he showed signs of promise, pitching 84 innings in 53 games with a 4.29 ERA as the Tigers' primary setup man.
In , Yoon played as a middle reliever and closer for the Tigers, and collected 9 holds and 19 saves. 
In , Yoon join the starting rotation due to Tigers' ace Han Ki-Joo's transition to a closing job. However, Yoon was not so successful, going 7-18 with a 3.78 ERA as a starter. While his ERA was decent, the poor run support he received gave in 18 losses, the most in the 2007 season. This gave him the nickname "The Unfortunate Ace". 
In , Yoon emerged as one of the most consistent pitchers in the KBO league, going 14-5 with a 2.33 ERA and 119 strikeouts in 154.2 innings pitched. He won the ERA title and finished runner-up to Kim Kwang-Hyun in wins. 
In August 2008, Yoon competed for the South Korea national baseball team in the 2008 Summer Olympics, where they won the gold medal in the baseball tournament. He was 2-0 with a save, a 2.34 ERA and 6 strikeouts, pitching 7.2 innings in 5 games as a utility pitcher. 
In March , Yoon competed for the South Korea national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, where he went 2-0 with a 1.13 ERA and 13 strikeouts in 16 innings pitched, appearing in 4 games. He started against Venezuela in the semifinal game, and led South Korea to a 10-2 victory. Yoon baffled the South American major league all-star squad, allowing only two runs and seven hits in 6.1 innings pitched.
In the beginning of the 2009 KBO season, Yoon became the Tigers' closer again as Han Ki-Joo was put on the disabled list. As a Tigers closer, he posted 7 saves with a 2.45 ERA. Yoon returned to the starting rotation but was put on the disabled list for a month. In July, he returned from the injury and won all of his 7 decisions as a starter. However, he had the worst pitching performance in his pro career on September 5, allowing 10 runs in just 3.1 innings against the Doosan Bears, and was then sidelined with a shoulder injury for the rest of the season. Yoon finished the season with a record of 9-4 with 7 saves, an ERA of 3.46 and 117 strikeouts in 119.2 innings pitched which didn't enable him to qualify for the ERA title.
Yoon was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the 2011 season. He received the KBO's highest honor for leading the league in four of the hurler’s statistics, marking a 2.45 ERA, 17 wins, 178 strikeouts, and a .773 winning percentage in 172 1/3 innings. He is the first pitcher to stand a top of four categories since 1991 in which Korean legend Sun Dong-yeol won.
Baltimore Orioles (2014–present).
A free agent after the 2013 season, Yoon announced his intentions to play in Major League Baseball. According to unconfirmed reports, Yoon has agreed to a three-year contract, worth US$5.75 million, with the Baltimore Orioles. On February 17, 2014, Yoon has passed his physicals and officially signed by the Orioles.

Dick Randolph

Richard L. "Dick" Randolph (born April 10, 1936) is a longtime insurance agency owner in Fairbanks, Alaska who is best known as the first person to be elected to partisan office under the banner of the Libertarian Party with his election to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1978. He was re-elected in 1980. He was instrumental in the repeal of the state income tax and saving the Alaska Permanent Fund, through effective use of the initiative process. He was also the LP's gubernatorial nominee in 1982, garnering nearly 15 percent of the vote.
Career.
Dick Randolph was born in Salmon, Idaho and graduated from Idaho State College in 1960 with a B.A. in education. He moved to Alaska that same year to teach school, spending several years doing such in Valdez and South Naknek. He moved to Fairbanks in 1964 and founded a State Farm Insurance agency, becoming its top sales agent in the nation in 1965. He also served as the state president and national vice-president for the Jaycees before entering politics.
Politics.
Randolph was first elected to the Alaska House in 1970 as a Republican. He was re-elected in 1972, but did not seek re-election in 1974, likely in protest of financial reporting laws which had just been enacted. A number of fellow legislators, also self-employed, had resigned from the legislature around this same time.
Dick Randolph joined the Libertarian Party (LP) in the wake of the 1976 presidential election, after having met its nominee Roger MacBride during one of his campaign trips to Alaska. For roughly the next eight years, Randolph would serve as the public face of the LP in Alaska.

Olszowa is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Ujazd, within Tomaszów Mazowiecki County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It lies approximately west of Ujazd, north-west of Tomaszów Mazowiecki, and south-east of the regional capital Łódź.
A small creek of Pańkówka (later called Bielina) flows through Olszowa.
History.
In 1406 Ścibor Bielina of Wola Drzazgowa bought Olszowa from Klemens of Wykno for 30 pieces of silver (grzywna). Ścibor had three sons Michał, Wacław and Wojciech. They all were noted in 1420–1421 as owners of Olszowa. In 1924 king Jagiełło allowed the three brothers to transfer Olszowa rights to "ius sredensis". 
Olszowa is also mentioned in 1429 when bishop Wojciech Jastrzębiec (on 5 September 1429 in Mnichowiec near Skierniewice) separated villages Olszowa and Popielawy from the parish of Małcz and on this basis and Ujazd, which newly obtained town rights (on 15 May 1428), created a new parish of Ujazd.
Little is known about Olszowa in the medieval period. In a court record of Brzeziny district one can read that in 1471 Stanisław of Gutków and Olszowa was sentenced to reimburse Piotr the citizen of Ujazd with 43 grzywna, the value of cattle, horses, sown seeds and other things. In 1488–1498 Marcin, a citizen of Ujazd, sued Wojciech of Olszowa and Gutków for compensation for his father's death of which Jakub Skórka a peasant of Olszowa was responsible.
In the 17th century the owner of Olszowa was Walerian Olszowski (*1587–†1650) (coat of arms Prus II). His father was Mikołaj O., his grandfather Jan Mikołaj O. and great grandfather was Mikołaj Niczek Czchodorff O., who is recorded in documents in 1438. It is not, however confirmed, if Walerian's ancestors resided in Olszowa. Walerian was also a grandson of Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski (*1503-†1572). Walerian served as podkomorzy of Wenden, podstoli of Wieluń and castellan of Spycimierz. With his second wife Zofia Dunin he had four sons: Andrzej, Hieronim, Zygmunt, Mikołaj and a daughter Katarzyna. His other sons also reached important ranks but Andrzej Olszowski (*2 Jan. 1621 – †29 Aug. 1677) reached the position of archbishop of Gniezno and primate of Poland (1674–1677). He was the one who crowned Jan III Sobieski for the king of Poland (at Wawel on 2 February 1676). Andrzej Olszowski was the founder of St. Adalbert church in Ujazd finished in 1680 (by his uncle's son Jan Olszowski, the castellan of Brzeziny), where a memorial plaque leaves no doubts about Andrzej's birthplace ("Andream in Olszowa Olszowski ...Hic ob vicinitatem nativae Olszoviae fronte levatus basilicam hanc.."). Walerian is buried at Stolec in the church of St. Lawrence where a sculptured tombstone in his memory is built in.
The next proven owner of Olszowa was Marcin Konstanty O. (*1643–†1687 or 1689), a son of Mikołaj O. and grandson of Walerian and then Andrzej Olszowski, starosta of Wieluń (16 July 1703 – 14 July 1719), a son of Hieronim O. and grandson of Walerian. He had no heir and Olszowa was taken over by Wiktor Olszowski the son of Stanisław, castellan of Wieluń and grandson of Walerian's brother.
In 1817–1822 the property of Olszowa was split into five villages: Olszowa, Helenów, Maksymów, Stasiolas and Olszowa-Piaski.
In 1827 Olszowa had 17 houses and population of 159. In 1886 the village of Olszowa had 16 houses and 112 dwellers and the folwark had 8 houses and 56 dwellers.
In 1899 the owner of folwark Olszowa was Juliusz Szczesław Malcz. In 1916 the owner was Bolesław Malcz, the son of Juliusz. B. Malcz was an active citizen. In 1906, during martial law in guberniya of Piotrków, he was sentenced to three months of prison for dictating the resolution of gmina Łazisko council, in 1916 he was a member of a Social Care Council of Łódź district (Łódzka Okręgowa Rada Opiekuńcza), a member of the Sienkiewicz memorial committee then a chairman of the board of fire brigade Ujazd (9 Dec. 1917 – 1925). In 1928 he is also mentioned as the owner of the folwark Olszowa. At that time in the folwark O. there was a grain distillery and a steam mill. In the 30s the folwark was sold to a consortium of three owners (one of them was Leon Jabłoński). B. Malcz and his wife Leonia Zofia Wanda (born Moszyńska) had three children: son Zbigniew, son Stanisław who left to Warsaw and daughter Elżbieta who left to England.
After World War II the distillery and mill were nationalized and closed. All machinery was removed in 1956. The remaining building was used for some time as a shelter for a mobile cinema and room for village gatherings. The building on the opposite side of the road housed GRN and a small post-office. Due to inadequate maintenance the buildings slowly went to ruins and now only a few walls remain.
The villages' five last soltyses were Józef Adamus (shortly before and during the war), Józef Goździk, Władysław Ścieszko, Sławomir Socha and now Zofia Socha.
Electricity was installed in the village in 1963–64. Earlier the only source of light was kerosene lamps. Kerosene was sold in a village store by volume. Running water pipes were installed in 2008 subsidized in part by the EU.
Education.
The Public Primary School of Olszowa was built in 1927–28. The building design was the one duplicated in several villages of middle-war Poland. It contained three classrooms at ground floor, school office and two apartments of a schoolmaster and teacher upstairs. Initially it had three classes only. Among first teachers were Seredyńska and Woźniak (schoolmaster). Wójcik, Nowak, and Leon Sowa were the teachers of that period. Other teachers were Ireneusz Gałecki and A. Gralak. L. Sowa was the last schoolmaster before World War II. He and his wife Kazimiera were teachers also under German occupation until early 1942. Both were arrested by the German occupants. Leon Sowa was imprisoned (number 44667) and died in Auschwitz on 13 August 1942. Kazimiera Sowa was held in Ravensbrück. She was brought into Ravensbrück concentration camp on 21 June 1942. She survived the war and taught shortly after the war in the same school. After the Sowas' arrest the teacher in Olszowa school was Helena Hekowa. The school returned to service after the war. In 1973 it was passed to gmina Ujazd. Halina Kula was the last schoolmaster. The school was dissolved in the 80s. The building was sold by gmina Ujazd to a private owner.

William Coningham

William Coningham (1815 – 20 December 1884) was a British Liberal politician and art collector.
Born in Penzance, he was the son of the Rev. Robert Coningham, a clergyman from County Londonderry and his wife Louisa née Capper, daughter of an officer in the East India Company Army. Although he was the Coningham's only child to survive infancy, he was extremely close to James Fitzjames, who was fostered by the Coningham family from infancy. The Coninghams treated James Fitzjames as if he was their own son and William regarded him as a brother.
Following education at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, Coningham obtained a commission in the 1st (Royal) Regiment of Dragoons in 1834, but bought himself out in 1836. He married Elizabeth Meyrick in Bath, Somerset, on 12 November 1840.
A keen correspondent, he exchanged a number of letters on spiritual matters with his cousin John Sterling. He was subsequently to edit and publish these as "Twelve Letters" in 1851. He was also a friend of Thomas Carlyle, and a number of letters between the two survive.
Coningham built up a large art collection, principally the work of Italian Old Masters. These included two panels of the "Adoring Saints" by Lorenzo Monaco, presented to the National Gallery, London in 1848. Other works included "Portrait of a Woman" by Francesco Montemezzano (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and "Tarquin and Lucretia" by Titian (now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). His collection of drawings is now widely scattered with examples in Princeton University Art Museum and elsewhere, but a group are in the British Museum.
A Liberal in politics, he was a supporter of Lord Palmerston and in favour of the extension of suffrage and the secret ballot. By 1847 he was living in Kemptown, Brighton and was chosen to contest the parliamentary constituency of Brighton at the general election of that year. He failed to be elected and at the next election in 1852 he stood at Westminster, again without success. He won a seat on his third attempt at the 1857 general election becoming one of two members of parliament for Brighton. He held the seat at the 1859 general election. 
By late 1863 it became apparent that Coningham's health was deteriorating. In January of the next year he announced his immediate retirement from the Commons. By 1868 his health had recovered and he attempted to regain his parliamentary seat at Brighton, standing as one of three Liberal candidates for the two seats in the constituency, but without success. 
He died at his Brighton residence in 1884, aged 69.

Harlequin Puppet Theatre

The Harlequin Puppet Theatre (founded 1958) is a puppet theatre at Rhos on Sea, Wales. Britain's oldest permanent puppet theatre, the Harlequin was built in 1958 by Eric Bramall and is now run by his former puppeteer partner, Chris Somerville. The small, 100-seat theatre is home to a collection of approximately 1,000 marionettes that feature in puppet shows during Britain's school holiday seasons.
History.
Theatre founder Eric Bramall (born in Wallasey, Merseyside, England) began putting on touring puppet shows in 1946, with the help of his mother. From 1951 to 1956, Bramall performed increasingly elaborate puppet shows each summer in a temporary theatre built onto an existing bandstand in Colwyn Bay, North Wales. After Colwyn Bay Council said he could no longer use the bandstand, a fellow puppet enthusiast named Millicent Ford who lived on the seafront at Rhos-on-Sea offered him a portion of her land on which to build a permanent puppet theatre. Architects drew up plans based on Eric Bramall's detailed ideas. The Harlequin was built in eleven weeks, using wood, glass, and local stone salvaged from derelict servants' quarters which had occupied the site. Bramall painted the murals on the auditorium walls in a single week. The Opening Ceremony was performed by Sir Clayton Russon on 7 July 1958. The resulting building won a Civic Trust Award for its design. Its construction marked the first time in British history that a permanent theatre had been specifically designed and built for puppet playing.
Since 1958 Bramall's marionette skills had been regularly featured on a children's television show; he and co-puppeteer Chris Somerville were subsequently given a weekly 15-minute puppet programme on BBC Wales, which continued until 1984. This and other outside work helped enable the Harlequin Puppet Theatre to stay in business, despite declining attendance over the decades. Eric Bramall died in July 1996. his theatre continues to operate under Chris Somerville's stewardship.
In an interview for "The Telegraph", Somerville commented on the increasingly endangered status of marionette artistry:

Wherstead

Wherstead is a village and a civil parish located in county Suffolk, England. Wherstead village lies south of Ipswich on the Shotley peninsula. It is an ancient settlement, and from its soil the plough has brought to light many evidences of occupation by Romans and by early Britons. In the "Domesday Book" the place is described under the names Querstede and Wervesteda. The name of the village and parish is in today generally pronounced Wersted or Warsted by the residents, the "a" in the latter case having the sound of "a" in father.
A short ride by electric railway through Ipswich streets carries one to Bourne bridge, which marks the boundary of Wherstead parish. Near the bridge, on the Wherstead side, stands the Ostrich Inn, as it stood at the time of the New England migration. In those days, however, oysters were still found in Orwell waters, and the name "Oyster Ridge" had not been corrupted to the name of the exotic bird whose effigy now adorns the swinging signboard of the roadside tavern.
The fields, when in view showed deep shades of green, brightened sometimes in the foreground by the hectic flush of wild poppies. The soil is light loam: the chief crops wheat, barley and roots.
Wherstead village is a scattered array of cottages lining a crooked lane which branches of from the high road on the east. The village is devoid of stores or public house, and the only industry, aside from agriculture, is carried on in a modest smithy.

Ekō-in

, also known as Honjo Ekō-in, is a Pure Land Buddhist temple in Ryōgoku, Tokyo. The formal name of the temple is , reflecting its founding principle of Pariṇāmanā, or the spreading of Amida Buddha's benevolence to all souls of all living creatures.
History.
On March 2, 1657, the Great Fire of Meireki destroyed 60 to 70% of the city of Edo (Tokyo) and killed about 100,000 people. The Shogun Tokugawa Ietsuna wished to commemorate the victims of the fire, most of whom were not survived by relatives. For this purpose he erected a monument called the "Banninzuka" (Mound of a Million Souls) and held a great memorial service conducted by of Zōjō-ji.
A temple for prayers to Amida Buddha was built at the same time. This was the origin of the Ekō-in, which today continues to offer a resting place for any soul who did not leave relatives behind, including victims of natural disasters, prisoners, and animals.
Sumo.
The temple was known as a sumo wrestling venue during the Edo and Meiji periods. The "kanjin-zumō", a charity fund raising event permitted by the Tokugawa shogunate and the origin of the current professional sumo, was first held in the temple in September 1768. The temple was the site of all tournaments from October 1833 to 1909. These 76 years are known as the period of "Ekō-in sumō". 
In 1909, the tournaments were moved into the original Ryōgoku Kokugikan, a modern arena in the temple precincts that had a capacity of 13,000 spectators and that was nicknamed as the Great Iron Umbrella. This contributed to the popularity of the sport by making it possible to hold sumo tournaments regardless of the weather. Also in the precincts is a monument called the , built in 1937 by the Sumo Association as a memorial to past wrestlers. Today it has become a place where apprentice wrestlers come to pray for power. 
After World War II, sumo tournaments moved to various venues in Tokyo and then to the Kuramae Kokugikan arena in Taitō, Tokyo before returning to the Ryōgoku district in 1985. The current Ryōgoku Kokugikan arena is located only about 400 meters from the temple.

Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam

Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam (Amharic: ተክለ ሐዋርዓት ተክለ ማርያም; June 1884 – April 1977) was an Ethiopian politician and intellectual of the Japanizer school. He was the primary author of Ethiopia's July 16, 1931 constitution, which was influenced by the Japanese Meiji Constitution.
Life.
Bahru Zewde includes Tekle Hawariat in the first generation of Ethiopians sent abroad for his education. Born in Shewa, after the initial stages of a traditional Ethiopian education at a local church Tekle Hawariat moved to Harar at the age of nine to live with a relative who was a retainer of "Ras" Makonnen Woldemikael. He accompanied the "Ras" against the Italians in 1895-6. It was during the First Italo-Ethiopian War that his mentor "Ras" Makonnen entrusted him to a member of the Russian Red Cross, Count Nikolai Leontieff, to take him back to Russia and have him educated. He arrived to Saint Petersburg in 1901, where he studied artillery at the Saint Petersburg military academy, achieving the rank of colonel. He was befriended by a number of prominent Russian liberals of the day, including Princess Volkonsky, daughter of the famous Decembrist revolutionary Sergei Volkonsky, and spent altogether 17 years in Russia. Once he returned to Ethiopia, however, Tekle Hawariat became famous as provincial governor, agronomist, and for his part in writing Ethiopia's first constitution. Tekle Hawariat was an important government official during the reign of Iyasu V, although he played a part in Iyasu's depostion of 27 September 1916. Despite his support for the new ruler, Empress Zauditu, during her reign he wrote and produced a play, "Fabula: Yawreoch Commedia", which used animal characters to criticize the corruption and backwardness of the Ethiopian court. As a result the Empress banned all further theatre in Ethiopia, an order that was later lifted by Emperor Haile Selassie in 1930.
Under the patronage of Haile Selassie (then the regent "Ras" Tafari), Tekle Hawariat first was made governor of Jijiga in 1917, and his efforts at this post gave him "a reputation for enlightened administration," according to Bahru Zewde, who goes on to note that "much of the credit for the transformation of Jijjiga from a garrison town to a modern urban centre goes to Takla-Hawaryat". Despite this good work, Tekle Hawariat either quit or was removed from this post: Tekle Hawariat in his unpublished autobiography claims "Ras" Tafari kept reappointing people he had dismissed for inefficiency. After a few years of idleness, Tekle Hawariat was appointed to another governorship, to the province of Charchar, one of the provinces Tafari was developing as a model of progressive or modern government; however, although he displayed enterprise and a dedication to duty, Tekle Hawariat had an independent character that led him to conflict with the Regent, and despite the demonstration of his skill at governor of Chercher province, because of his early Russian connections due to a Bolshevik panic that had gripped the capital, in 1928 Tekle Hawariat, was arrested and kept in jail for some time.
After becoming Emperor, Haile Selassie found another use for Tekle Hawariat: he was given the duty of drafting the first Constitution of Ethiopia. Bahru Zewde comments that Tekle Hawariat "could be said to have been waiting almost all his life for just an occasion"; however, his draft was subjected to close scrutiny by the Emperor and his associates "Ras" Kasa and Heruy Welde Sellase, who modified Tekle Hawariat's text "to meet imperial needs." Changes included the legislative powers granted to the parliament were reduced, and instead of Tekle Hawariat's proposal that the deputies be elected the final draft made them appointed.
Three months after the promulgation of the constitution, Tekle Hawariat was made Minister of Finance, but he lasted in that office barely more than a year. Bahru Zewde believes the reason for this brief tenure was due to his efforts to make the office efficient and responsible, which led to inevitable conflicts not only with traditional-minded ministers, but with the Emperor himself who did not care to make a distinction between the public purse and the private accounts of the emperor. "Given the acrimonious relations with the palace," notes Bahru Zewde, "it is not much of a surprise that Takla-Hawaryat next found himself posted as Ethiopian minister to London, Paris, and Geneva."
Tekle Hawariat had been part of the group who accompanied Haile Selassie to Europe in 1924, so although he could have been chosen for these duties because of his qualifications, Bahru Zewde insists "the evidence is too strong for this being more a case of removing from centre stage a character who was too independent and self-willed for the emperor's taste." His most important posting was representing Ethiopia at the League of Nations for many years, most notably at the sessions during the Walwal Incident. However, the uncooperative attitudes of not only the British and French delegates frustrated him so much he asked Emperor Haile Selassie to be relieved so he could return to Ethiopia where he could be of better use using his military training to organize his country's defenses against the unavoidable conflict.
Tekle Hawariat crossed paths with his Emperor one last time, while the other was leaving Ethiopia to make a personal appeal to the League of Nations. When Haile Selassie and his entourage reached Mieso, he was there with his troops; Tekle Hawariat boarded the train. As John Spencer tersely states, "The encounter must have been a bitter one." Spencer happened to be aboard the train five days later which stopped at Afdem, where Tekle Hawariat boarded train and entered Spencer's compartment. "Although I must have been for him an almost complete stranger, he lost no time unburdening himself to me of his thoughts about Haile Selassie, whom he denounced as a traitor to Ethiopia, a coward, and one unworthy to bear the title of Emperor after his flight into exile."
Once he reached Djibouti, he sought an agricultural concession, but the local authorities politely refused him. Tekle Hawariat then moved to Aden, where in September 1937 he petitioned the colonial government in Kenya to resettle there. The authorities refused his request, concerned that his presence would encourage unrest against the Italians. According to Bahru Zewde, Haile Selassie's victorious return to Ethiopia found his one-time ambassador in Madagascar where he prolonged his exile until 1955/56, and upon returning to Ethiopia Tekle Hawariat "retired to the obscurity of a gentleman-farmer's life in Hirna, Hararge." Tekle Hawariat and the Emperor were late in the former's life.
Further details.
Paul Henze credits Tekle Hawariat with introducing to Haile Selassie to the three Habtewold brothers -- Makonnen Habte-Wold, Aklilu Habte-Wold, and Akalework Habte-Wold -- who became prominent in Ethiopian political life.
The sons of Tekle Hawariat include Germachew Tekle-Hawariat (died 1987). Educated in Switzerland, Germachew served as a diplomat after Haile Selassie's restoration in 1941, as well as being a noted author, whose works include the novel "Araya" and a play based on the life of the 19th century Ethiopian emperor Tewodros I.
Princess Elena Volkonsky raised Tekle Hawariat, because he was adopted by her oldest son Colonel Manchanov, who never married. Tekle Hawariat considered her his grandmother and has stated this in his biography. Tekle Hawariat loved Russia and his Russian family. He kept in touch with them even after the Russian Revolution. One of his aunts took refuge in Ethiopia and stayed with the Tekle Hawariat family in Hirna, where he was Governor of Chercher. All this information is in his biography that was published in Amahric. Also in this autobiography is the only published eyewitness account of the death of Emperor Haile Selassie's mother, Woizero Yeshimebet Ali, in childbirth.
Tekle Hawariat's biography has been published in Amahric by the University of Addis Ababa.

John Gallagher (golfer)

John Gallagher (born 17 April 1981) is a Scottish professional golfer on the PGA EuroPro Tour. In April 2009 he earned full tour playing privileges when he shot a closing one-under par 70 in final qualifying at Frilford Heath. His rounds of 68-70-72 (-6) at the April 2012 final qualifier placed him on the Europro tour for the fourth consecutive year.
Gallagher's most prolific amateur victory came at the 2007 Scottish Amateur Championship which was played at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire. The final match was a resounding 4&3 win over Keir McNicoll. He also finished 2nd in the 2005 Amateur Championship, defeating 19-year-old sensation Lloyd Saltman in the semi-final.
Gallagher reached as high as 14th in the World Amateur Golf Ranking. His key strength is consistently accurate play from tee to green. He is a self-taught right-handed golfer with a "cack-handed" or "cross-handed" grip. He grips every club with his left hand below his right.
Biography.
Born to an Irish father and Scottish mother, Gallagher was raised and educated in Edinburgh, Scotland, where his father John was and is a greenskeeper. Young John grew up playing at a modest local golf club and taught himself the game without the benefit of even one lesson.
Gallagher won three important Scottish amateur tournaments — the 2005 Craigmillar Park Open, the 2006 Tennant Cup, and the 2007 Scottish Amateur Championship. He also played for Scotland in its back-to-back victories at the Home Internationals in 2005 and 2006 and at the Spirit International in Trinity, Texas in 2005. He competed in several national amateur championships and in numerous elite amateur tournaments across four continents.
Amateur career.
Gallagher burst into the international spotlight with his runner-up finish in the 2005 Amateur Championship at Royal Birkdale. After his semi-final victory over heavily favored Lloyd Saltman the relatively unknown golfer was suddenly one match away from claiming one of the top two amateur titles in the world and earning coveted invitations to the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship. Irishman Brian McElhinney, however, got ahead early in their final match and Gallagher could never mount a serious charge in the blustery conditions. Gallagher's impressive run through one of the strongest fields in amateur golf put him on the international map and he was ranked 14th in the world among amateur golfers. Participating in Scotland's victory at the Home Internationals over Ireland, Wales, and a very strong English contingent capped off his breakthrough 2005 season.
Several strong finishes in 2006 including victory in the Tennant Cup saw Gallagher again briefly break into the top 50 of the worldwide amateur golf ranking. He began to experience pain in his wrist which affected his play somewhat as the 2007 season wore on. Told that he would not likely make things worse by playing in this pain, he entered the Scottish Amateur Championship and won, earning an invitation to the Scottish Open on the European Tour. Gallagher underwent surgery on his wrist after the 2007 season.
The 2008 season began with residual pain in the wrist and uneven results in competition for Gallagher. He rounded into form in time to begin the Scottish Open with a three under par 68. On the second day he was again three under par through 16 holes at the demanding Loch Lomond course and appeared atop the second page of the leader board. His double-bogey triple-bogey finish cost him the chance to play on the weekend. This outstanding performance (save the last two holes), solidified his confidence in his ability to compete in the professional ranks which he joined in 2009.
Gallagher represented Scotland at three consecutive Home Internationals competitions and was on the winning side each of his first two years. By September, 2007 his wrist pain was acute, and it limited his effectiveness in his third campaign. His career record at the Home Internationals was 6-7-2, scoring 7 points.
Professional career.
In 2009, Gallagher's highest finish on the PGA EuroPro Tour was T-23. He twice shot what was then his low competitive professional round of 67. He first accomplished this at the MotoCaddy Masters at The Players Club near Codrington in July. Three weeks later, he again recorded a 67 in the opening round, this time at the Virgin Atlantic 25th Anniversary Classic at Marriott Tudor Park. Gallagher finished the 2009 season 69th on the PGA EuroPro Tour order of merit and was 93rd in 2010 while playing in just 9 events.
In 2011 Gallagher earned his first professional victory at the West Lancashire Open. In the process he achieved his lowest 18-hole score to date with a 65. He finished 33rd on the 1836 Tour order of merit while appearing in just 5 events. He also competed on the EuroPro tour, with his best finish coming at the Network Veka Classic (18th). While entering 8 events he finished 86th on the EuroPro tour order of merit.
Gallagher opened the 2012 season by shooting 67-70-70-68 (-12) to finish tied for 2nd place in the Scottsdale Classic Pro-Am. This was his first professional appearance in the U.S. He followed this up in March with his second professional victory, winning the Valenti Pro-Am at San Roque with 71-70-71 (-4). In April he finished T-9 in the final stage of the EuroPro Tour qualifying school. At the conclusion of the 2012 EuroPro regular season he stands 61st on the Order of Merit.
In 2013 Gallagher's highlights included a runner-up finish at La Reserva on the Gecko Pro Tour and two 6th place finishes.

Theatre of Estonia

Theatre of Estonia dates to 1784 when August von Kotzebue founded an amateur theatre company in Tallinn. Most of the plays at the time were comedies for the amusement for local Baltic German nobility. In 1809 a professional theatre company was established, with its own building in Tallinn. The repertoire was mostly in German but plays in Estonian and Russian were also performed.
After centuries of serfdom that was abolished in Estonia in 1816, the first native Estonian musical society, Vanemuine, was established in 1865. The Vanemuine society's staging of Lydia Koidula's "The Cousin from Saaremaa" in 1870 marks the birth of Estonian theater.
The Vanemuine Music and Theatre Society was headed by August Wiera from 1878 to 1903. In 1906 a new building was erected for the society and the theater company turned professional under the directorship of Karl Menning. Plays by Western writers such as Henrik Ibsen, Gerhart Hauptmann, Russian Maksim Gorky and Estonian August Kitzberg, Oskar Luts and Eduard Vilde were staged.
Also in 1906 the Estonia Music and Theatre Society in Tallinn turned professional under the leadership of Theodor Altermann and Paul Pinna. This company later became the Estonian national opera.

Nonnosus

Saint Nonnosus (c. 500 - c. 560), also "Nonosius", was a prior at the San Silvestre monastery on Monte Soratte north of Rome and later a monk at Suppentonia, near Civita Castellana. He was a contemporary of Saint Benedict of Nursia. Alban Butler has written that “so little information has survived about Nonnosus that he is not especially interesting in himself.” His name does not appear in any ancient martyrology. 
A deacon Nonnosus is mentioned in a 12th-century collection of legends from Carinthia, Austria. His cult was strong in Bavaria, where relics are kept in the crypt of Freising Cathedral. Veneration of Nonnosus was also established at Monte Soratte in the 1650s, due to the efforts of Andrea di San Bonaventura, a Cistercian monk, and in 1661 some of his relics returned to Monte Soratte and Nonnosus' cult spread across central Italy. It is highly likely that the legends of two different persons had been merged into one by then.
Sources.
The sole source on Nonnosus' life is Pope Gregory I (r. 590-604), who wrote about Saint Nonnosus after being asked by some friends to create a compendium of miracle stories associated with Italian saints. Maximian, bishop of Syracuse, provided Gregory with information about Nonnosus, after Gregory had forgotten the details of the stories associated with Nonnosus -details in turn acquired from Laurio, an old monk of the monastery of Suppentonia. Laurio had been a friend of Nonnosus while the two lived the monastic life there under the Abbot St. Anastasius of Suppentonia. According to Gregory, Nonnosus was a particularly good-natured man and was buried at Monte Soratte.
A re-interpretation for the origins of Nonnosus was posited by archaeological excavations at the village of Molzbichl, near Spittal an der Drau in Carinthia. There, a tombstone carries an early Christian inscription plate that reads: “Here rests the servant of Christ, Nonnosus, deacon, who lived more or less for 103 years. He died on September 2 at this place died on July 20...three years after the consulate of the illustrious men Lampadius and Orestes in 533.” The plate may have been translated to the church from the nearby ancient city of "Teurnia" (at present-day St. Peter in Holz in Lendorf), where Nonnosus could have served as a deacon in the troubled border area near the Danube. The area of St. Peter in Holz was, since the days of Emperor Arnulf, under the jurisdiction of the bishops of Freising, so relics could have been transferred to Freising from there.
Legends.
Miracles told of Nonnosus, as recorded by St. Gregory, state that Nonnosus removed an enormous rock that had occupied land on which he wanted to grow cabbage –fifty pairs of oxen had not been able to move it; that he miraculously restored a glass lamp that had been shattered against the floor; and that he completely filled several receptacles with olive oil after the a particularly bad harvest for the olive crop. The legends told of him tell of his ability to calm his abbot, who was a despotic and irascible man.
Veneration.
When Monte Soratte was attacked by Muslim forces at the end of the 9th century, Nonnosus’ relics were taken to Suppentonia, and then, around 1050, to Freising in Bavaria. This occurred during the episcopate of Bishop Nitker of Freising (r. 1039 -1052). A fire damaged the cathedral of Freising in 1159, and in 1161, while the foundations of the church were being dug, remains of three people were discovered, identified as the relics of Nonnosus, and two other saints: Alexander and Justin. The relics were reburied in the crypt of the cathedral, after being translated there by Bishop Albert I of Freising (1158–1184) in the presence of Archbishop Eberhard of Salzburg.
In 1708, they were rediscovered again when a brick wall collapsed –but no one could remember their origin. Nevertheless, the Freising prince-bishop Johann Franz von Eckher (1696–1727) identified them as belonging to Nonnosus and buried the relics in 1709 with great pomp in the crypt again, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage site. Nonnosus' head was taken to Bamberg at an uncertain date. 
Churches dedicated to Nonnosus stand not only in Molzbichl and St. Peter in Holz, but also in Berg im Drautal, Hermagor, and Sappada ("Pladen") in Italy. In Germany, Nonnosus was prayed to by sufferers from diseases of the kidneys. At Freising, these sufferers performed a ritual that involved crawling three times around Nonnosus' sarcophagus on all fours, while praying for the saint’s help, a ritual called the "reptatio per cryptam" or "Durchschlüpfsbrauch".

Ganymede (mythology)

In Greek mythology, Ganymede (; ; Greek: , "Ganymēdēs") is a divine hero whose homeland was Troy. Homer describes Ganymede as the most beautiful of mortals. He was the son of Tros of Dardania, from whose name "Troy" was supposed to derive, and of Callirrhoe. His brothers were Ilus and Assaracus. In one version of the myth, he is abducted by Zeus, in the form of an eagle, to serve as cup-bearer in Olympus. The myth was a model for the Greek social custom of "paiderastía", the socially acceptable erotic relationship between a man and a youth. The Latin form of the name was Catamitus (and also "Ganymedes"), from which the English word "catamite" derives.
Myth.
Ganymede was abducted by Zeus from Mount Ida, near Troy in Phrygia. Ganymede had been tending sheep, a rustic or humble pursuit characteristic of a hero's boyhood before his privileged status is revealed. Zeus either sent an eagle or turned himself into an eagle to transport the youth to Mount Olympus.
In the "Iliad", Zeus is said to have compensated Ganymede's father Tros by the gift of fine horses, "the same that carry the immortals", delivered by the messenger god Hermes. Tros was consoled that his son was now immortal and would be the cupbearer for the gods, a position of much distinction. Walter Burkert found a precedent for the Ganymede myth on an Akkadian seal that depicts the hero-king Etana riding heavenwards on an eagle.
In Olympus, Zeus granted him eternal youth and immortality and the office of cupbearer to the gods, supplanting Hebe. Edmund Veckenstedt associated Ganymede with the genesis of the intoxicating drink mead, which had a traditional origin in Phrygia. All the gods were filled with joy to see the youth, except for Hera, Zeus's consort, who regarded Ganymede as a rival for her husband's affection. Zeus later put Ganymede in the sky as the constellation Aquarius, which is associated with that of the Eagle (Aquila). A moon of Jupiter, the planet named for Zeus's Roman counterpart, was named Ganymede by astronomer Simon Marius.
Ganymede was afterwards also regarded as the genius of the fountains of the Nile, the life-giving and fertilizing river. Thus the divinity that distributed drink to the gods in heaven became the genius who presided over the due supply of water on earth.
Plato accounts for the pederastic aspect of the myth by attributing its origin to Crete, where the social custom of "paiderastía" was supposed to have originated (see "Cretan pederasty"). He has Socrates deny that Ganymede was the "catamite" of Zeus, and say the god loved him non-sexually for his "psychē", "mind" or "soul," giving the etymology of his name as "ganu-", "taking pleasure," and "mēd-", "mind." Ganymede, he points out, was the only one of Zeus's lovers who was granted immortality.
In poetry, Ganymede became a symbol for the beautiful young male who attracted homosexual desire and love. He is not always portrayed as acquiescent: in the "Argonautica" of Apollonius of Rhodes, Ganymede is furious at the god Eros for having cheated him at the game of chance played with knucklebones, and Aphrodite scolds her son for "cheating a beginner." The Augustan poet Virgil portrays the abduction with pathos: the boy's aged tutors try in vain to draw him back to Earth, and his hounds bay uselessly at the sky. The loyal hounds left calling after their abducted master is a frequent motif in visual depictions, and is referenced also by Statius:
Here the Phrygian hunter is borne aloft on tawny wings, Gargara’s range sinks downwards as he rises, and Troy grows dim beneath him; sadly stand his comrades; vainly the hounds weary their throats with barking, pursue his shadow or bay at the clouds.""
In the arts.
Ancient.
One of the earliest depictions of Ganymede is a red-figure krater by the Berlin Painter in the Musée du Louvre. Zeus pursues Ganymede on one side, while on the other side the youth runs away, rolling along a hoop while holding aloft a crowing cock. In fifth-century Athens, vase-painters often depicted the mythological story, which was so suited to the all-male symposium or formal banquet. The Ganymede myth was treated in recognizable contemporary terms, illustrated with common behavior of homoerotic courtship rituals, as on a vase by the "Achilles Painter" where Ganymede also flees with a cock. Ganymede is usually depicted as a well-developed, muscular young man.
Leochares (about 350 BCE), a Greek sculptor of Athens who was engaged with Scopas on the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus cast a (lost) bronze group of Ganymede and the Eagle, a work that was held remarkable for its ingenious composition, which boldly ventured to the verge of what is allowed by the laws of sculpture, and also for its charming treatment of the youthful form as it soars into the air. It is apparently imitated in a well-known marble group in the Vatican, half life-size. Such Hellenistic gravity-defying feats were influential in the sculpture of the Baroque.
Renaissance and Baroque.
In Shakespeare's "As You Like It" (1599), a comedy of mistaken identity in the magical setting of the Forest of Arden, Celia, dressed as a shepherdess, becomes "Aliena" (Latin "stranger", Ganymede's sister) and Rosalind, because she is "more than common tall", dresses up as a boy, Ganymede, a well-known image to the audience. She plays on her ambiguous charm to seduce Orlando, but also (involuntarily) the shepherdess Phebe. Thus behind the conventions of Elizabethan theater in its original setting, the young boy playing the girl Rosalind dresses up as a boy and is then courted by another boy playing Phebe.
When painter-architect Baldassare Peruzzi included a panel of "The Rape of Ganymede" in a ceiling at the Villa Farnesina, Rome, ("ca" 1509-1514), Ganymede's long blond hair and girlish pose make him identifiable at first glance, though he grasps the eagle's wing without resistance. In Antonio Allegri Correggio's "Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle" (Vienna) Ganymede's grasp is more intimate. Rubens' version portrays a young man. But when Rembrandt painted the "Rape of Ganymede" for a Dutch Calvinist patron in 1635, a dark eagle carries aloft a plump cherubic baby (Paintings Gallery, Dresden) who is bawling and urinating in fright.
Examples of Ganymede in 18th century France have been studied by Michael Preston Worley. The image of Ganymede was invariably that of a naive adolescent accompanied by an eagle and the homoerotic aspects of the legend were rarely dealt with. In fact, the story was often "heterosexualized." Moreover, the neoplatonic interpretation of the myth, so common in the Italian Renaissance, in which the rape of Ganymede represented the ascent to spiritual perfection, seemed to be of no interest to Enlightenment philosophers and mythographers. Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre, Charles-Joseph Natoire, Guillaume II Coustou, Pierre Julien, Jean-Baptiste Regnault and others contributed images of Ganymede to French art during this period.
Modern.
My first thought, my first flash was that it was a beautiful woman... The angel was beautiful, with a face dominated by immense, lustrous green eyes and framed by golden ringlets, and with a bow mouth and full lips and brilliant white teeth.
And only then, only after I had felt that first rush of improbable carnal lust, did it occur to me that this angel was a man.
Ancient sources.
Ganymede is named by various ancient Greek and Roman authors:

Volodymyr Ivanovych Barvinok

Barvinok Volodymyr Ivanovych ( July 22, 1879, Ohramyyevychi, Chernihiv oblast - 1943, Kiev, Russian Empire ) was a Ukrainian historian, theologist, bibliographer, writer, archaeologist, prominent archivist, statesman of the Ukrainian National Republic, honorary citizen of the Chernihiv region, scholar at the Ukrainian Academy of Science, and teacher of Ukrainian culture and history.
Biography.
Volodymyr Barvinok was born in 1879 at the family country house, which was located in the Ogramyyevychi village in the Chernihiv region. In 1905, Barvinok graduated from the Kyiv Mohyla Academy, which today is called the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. On the same year, he married Yevheniya Volovik, who was originally from Uman. The Barvinok family lived in the Podil district of Kiev, at 31 Frunze street.
From 1905 to 1917, Volodymyr Barvinok and his family lived in St.Petersburg, where his son Boris was born. From 1905 to 1908, Barvinok studied in Saint Petersburg Archeological Institute. From 1908 to 1911, he majored in history and philology at the St.Petersburg University, then called Petrograd University. Consequently, he earned a masters degree in theology. The family frequently took trips to Kiev in their free time.
Up until the year 1917, he worked in the central apparatus of the Most Holy Synod. At the same time, during 1912-1917, he lectured in history at the St.Petersburg's Realschule of A.I.Gelda. Upon receiving the first news of the revolution, Volodymyr Barvinok immediately returned to Kiev, where he was deeply involved in the renewal of Ukrainian independence.
By 1918, Volodymyr Barvinok, as a prominent bibliographer and a scholar of ancient manuscripts and books, assisted in the formation of the National Library of Ukrainian State. From 1918 to 1919, he worked for the Ukrainian State, later for the Ukrainian National Republic at the department of confessions, then for the Ministry of Confessions.
The aim of this department as a whole, as well as Volodymyr Barvinok's particular responsibility, was regulating and conducting the state policy towards the Church. The Ministry demanded from the Church an implementation of a Ukrainization policy of the official documents and pushed for the independence (autocephaly) of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church from the Moscow Patriarchate. The Ministry's work created a friendly partnership between the independent state of Ukraine and the Church. Simultaneously to his work at the Ukrainian National Republic's government institutions, Barvinok worked as a professor of literature and Ukrainian culture at a technical school in Kiev.
From 1924 until 1933, Barvinok worked on the archaeological committee at the Ukrainian Academy of Science. At the same time, he worked for the Ukrainian Scientific Institute of Printing, where he published the prominent and comprehensive work «General survey of old prints in libraries of Kiev». In the introduction, he criticizes the lack of financing for the Ukrainian Academy of Science and underlines principal differences between old prints of Kiev and Moscow, both dangerous acts at the time. From 1928 to 1930, he worked as a secretary of the Sophia commission of the Academy of Science and its art branch. In 1930, his grandson Yury was born.
The Sophia commission aimed at preserving Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, which Soviet authorities planned to demolish as they had destroyed St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery. Soviet authorities aimed at eradicating any signs of authentic Ukrainian cultural heritage. Due to the tedious work of the commission, Saint Sophia cathedral, arguably the most historically important Ukrainian structure, was spared from a tragic end.
In the mid-1930s, Barvinok donated his vast library to the Kiev University, where it formed the basis of several scientific branches. In the period from 1930 to 1933, Barvinok worked as the secretary of the All Ukrainian Archaeological Committee, which coordinated all archaeological work in Ukraine. In 1937, his son Boris, a bridge engineer, was arrested by the NKVD, Soviet secret police; Barvinok never saw him again. This was not the first instance of repression against Volodymyr Barvinok's family. Those close to him lived in constant fear, facing arrests and torture. Barvinok, being a participant of the highest echelons of both the Russian Empire and the independent Ukraine, was a tempting target for the Soviets, but his prominence in numerous scientific circles made it difficult to arrest him personally. Towards the end of his life, Barvinok wrote on Slavic and Ukrainian themes; many of his works were never published. He died in 1943 during the German occupation of Kiev.

Pątnów, Łódź Voivodeship

Pątnów is a village in Wieluń County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Pątnów. It lies approximately south of Wieluń and south-west of the regional capital Łódź.
The village has an approximate population of 1,400.
History.
Its name appears in the written records also as Patnowo, Pantchanow. In 1339 the village leader Stanimir sold the slaughter in Wieluń for the mill and a quarter of field in Pątnów. In 16th the local parish included Pątnów and Bieniec. In those times the village belonged partly to Wieluń and partly to Mateusz Skrzyński. In 1553 it is mentioned that the wooden church was there at the beginning of the 16th century. At the beginning of the 19th century a small landed estate of about 80 ha changed the owners for Germans- the Kreczmers. At the beginning of 20th century there were distillery, the manufacture of starch, ponds and a park (1.08 ha) planned by the Kreczmers. Before World War I the landed estate was bought by Kobylański, the former leaseholder of an estate in Bieniec. On the village grounds there were “Osada Młyńska” (“The Mill Settlement”), although there wasn't any mill and so called “Jatka”- with reference to Janina Szymańska’s estate, which had existed here in the past. In 1926 the railway stop was built. In September 1940 Germans displaced Polish people from the Pątnów Commune and settled Germans from Wołyń here. Every German Family got three Polish farms. The name was changed for Patenau (Bieniec for Biennenzel, Dzietrzniki for Dietzfield, Kadłub for Rumfeck). After the war the former manor farms' terrain was taken over by Gminna Spółdzielnia (The Commune Association), which has devastated previous manor order.
Transport.
The village is cut through by a busy trunk road 43 Częstochowa- Wieluń and by a railway line 181 Herby Nowe- Wieluń Dąbrowa. There is a station for passenger trains.
Church and Chapel.
The present Church was built in 1917-1927 on the place of the former wooden church. On the rood beam there is a baroque crucifix from 18th century. There is also a font from 18th century. On the village's terrain there is a beautiful stone chapel from 18th century. It is covered by a four-sided tent roof. Inside there is a historic sculpture of Pensive Christ.

Nano-RK

Nano-RK is a real-time operating system (RTOS) from Carnegie Mellon University designed to run on micro-controllers for use in sensor networks. Nano-RK supports a fixed-priority fully preemptive scheduler with fine-grained timing primitives to support real-time task sets. "Nano" implies that the RTOS is small, consuming 2 KB of RAM and using 18 KB of flash, while "RK" is short for "resource kernel". A resource kernel provides reservations on how often system resources can be consumed. For example, a task might only be allowed to execute 10 ms every 150 ms (CPU reservation), or a node might only be allowed to transmit 10 network packets per minute (network reservation). These reservations form a virtual energy budget to ensure a node meets its designed battery lifetime as well as protecting a failed node from generating excessive network traffic. Nano-RK is open source, is written in C and runs on the Atmel-based FireFly sensor networking platform, the MicaZ motes as well as the MSP430 processor. 
The following article discusses some of the tradeoffs associated with using an RTOS in sensor networks.

Fashion background.
Nigo's venture into fashion started in a small store selling a few Bape t-shirts and camouflage print hoodies, which became very popular among teenagers. Nigo then released the Bapesta, a sneaker which, according to Jonathan Ross, became the "epitome of collectable footwear." The Bapesta logo on the side of the shoe resembles the Nike swoosh but has a lightning zap and a star instead. The clothing line is considered by many Americans to be difficult to acquire, considering the fact that the only store in the United States is in New York. (Los Angeles store closed in the summer of 2010.) Along with Pharrell Williams, Nigo is also responsible for helping produce the Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream Footwear brands. He is now the creative director for Uniqlo's UT brand.
Musical and entertainment background.
Nigo has currently been associated with popular rap and hip hop artists such as Kanye West and Pharrell Williams. He is the DJ of the popular Japanese hip hop group Teriyaki Boyz and is also owner of BAPE sounds record label. He currently has a show he created himself for MTV Japan called Nigoldeneye.

Timeline of religion

The timeline of religion is a chronological catalog of important and note-worthy religious events in pre-historic and modern times. This article reaches extensively into pre-historic times, as the bulk of the human religious experience is not relegated to written history. Written history is only, approximately, 5000 years old (the age of formal writing). A lack of written records results in the fact that most of the knowledge about pre-historic religion is derived from archaeological records and other indirect sources, and suppositions. Much pre-historic religion is subject to continued debate.
Prehistoric period (300th millennium to 34th century BCE).
A commonly held marker for the dawn of religious belief and practice is the advent of intentional burial marks.
Ancient history (33rd century BCE to 3rd century CE).
33rd to 12th century BCE.
The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was a Bronze Age civilization (3300–1300 BCE; mature period 2600–1900 BCE) in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent, Flourishing around the Indus River basin, the civilization extended east into the Ghaggar-Hakra River valley and the upper reaches Ganges-Yamuna Doab; it extended west to the Makran coast of Balochistan, north to northeastern Afghanistan and south to Daimabad in Maharashtra. The civilization was spread over some 1,260,000 km², making it the largest known ancient civilization.
The Indus Valley is one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, along with its contemporaries, Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. At its peak, the Indus Civilization may have had a population of well over five million. Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley developed new techniques in handicraft (carnelian products, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). The civilization is noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system, and multistoried houses as well as for containing artifacts which could be linked to pre-vedic religions.

Homalomena

Homalomena is a genus of flowering plants within the family Araceae. It is estimated to be composed of approximately 80 to 150 species. Homalomena are primarily found in southern Asia and the southwestern Pacific, but there are a few species that are known to be indigenous to South America. Many Homalomena have a strong smell of anise. The name derives apparently from a mi-translated Malayan vernacular name, translated as "homalos", meaning flat, and "mene" = moon.
The plants of this genus are clump-forming evergreen perennials with mainly heart-shaped or arrowheaded shaped leaves. The flowers are tiny and without petals, enclosed in a usually greenish spathe hidden by the leaves.
The Tamils knew of this plant for more than 3000 years. It is called merugu (Tamil: மெருகு ) and it is used for several purposes including curing stomach disorders, piles, flem etc. Several oils like kumaraguru enney; merugulli enney, merugu pachai enneyetc. are prepared to cure various type of diseases.
"Homalomena wallisii" is occasionally seen as a cultivated plant. In 2011 it was moved to the genus "Adelonema" together with all the neotropical species of "Homalomena".

Richard Fellowes Benyon

Richard Fellowes Benyon (17 November 1811 – 26 July 1897), born Richard Fellowes, was a British Conservative politician and civil servant.
Richard was born at Haverland Hall in Norfolk, the third son of William Henry Fellowes of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire and his wife, Emma, sister of Richard Benyon De Beauvoir of Englefield House in Berkshire. He inherited this latter property and its associated estates upon his uncle's death in 1854 and changed his name to Benyon. In 1857 he was made High Sheriff of Berkshire, and was made the Chairman of the county's Quarter Sessions in 1864. In 1860, he had been elected as the Member of Parliament for Berkshire, a position he held until his resignation in 1876. He was a patron of the Mendicity Society, the National Society for School Furniture and the Society for the Augmentation of Small Livings. Although he married and had three daughters, upon his death in 1897, his estates were inherited by his nephew, James Herbert Benyon. Richard was the great grandfather of Sir William Benyon.

Adam Seymour is a guitarist and songwriter who began his recording career with the Katydids, a South London quintet that recorded two albums before disbanding. Seymour met Katydids singer Susie Hug in 1987 when both were playing on sessions for Big Bam Boo. Developing an instant rapport the duo formed a band recruiting other members Dan James (guitar), Dave Hunter (bass) and Shane Young (drummer). Seymour and Hug wrote the material for the band.
After Reprise Records dropped the Katydids, Seymour joined The Pretenders for four albums: "Last of the Independents", the live album "The Isle of View", "Viva el Amor" and "Loose Screw". Additional performances featuring Seymour appeared on the four-disc Rhino Records release "Pirate Radio" which chronicled the band's career. Seymour contributed as a songwriter to The Pretenders' output, the first time that a band member (outside of the original members James Honeyman-Scott and Pete Farndon) had been allowed to do so. Seymour played with the band from 1993 through 2007.

Banzai Girl

Banzai Girl is a full-color comic book series created, written and drawn by Jinky Coronado. The series was originally published by Sirius Comics with the first volume's full-color trade released by Sirius Comics in 2005. A black-and-white manga expanded version of that material was released by Arcana Studio in 2007. 2007 also saw the release of the second series in full color by Arcana Studio entitled Banzai Girls. The second storyline has also been collected, into a follow-up manga black-and-white trade released summer 2009.
Volume 1.
Banzai Girl, Jinky Coronado, is a girl of three parallel worlds. The problem is she just doesn’t know it yet. The first volume tells the story of Jinky Coronado, a sexy Asian schoolgirl whose nightmares of being a Princess and a Futuristic Freedom Fighter foretell of extraordinary adventures that effect and inspire her real life. Jinky has to deal with High School, romance, grades, and friends until her life is turned upside down for the weird. Her teachers, and eventually her whole town of adults, become controlled by invading creatures that are dubbed the Shadow Whisperers. But Jinky and her best friend Katie J. realize that their parents have been acting a little out of the ordinary. jinky and Katie need to take matters into their own hands to save the world. BANZAI GIRL uses Filipino urban legends as the source of their conflict, including a sinister Snakeman beneath a shopping mall and the menacing Manananggal, a revolting, horrifying vampire that splits apart at the waist. 
Volume 2.
Jinky is caught by the Kapre. Eight months after the story told in volume 1, BANZAI GIRL, Jinky Coronado and Michelle Bebot, Jinky's friend (based on her sister in real life), have become bona fide popstars! Their new CD is out, and they’re touring the world. (Yes, a real music CD from Jinky and Michelle has also been released.) But what can go wrong, what is the problem, not all is well at home. A terrifying creature known as the Kapre has been spotted in the woods. The town has noticed that kids have been disappearing, is the Kapre the cause. Katie J. also returns and is all grown up. Katie has her own plans to take on the Kapre without the help of Jinky or Michelle. The conclusion introduces us to the new Coronado and is nicknames Banzai Girl 2.0 hinting at a third volume.

Rail transport in Lebanon

Rail transport in Lebanon began in the 1890s and continued for most of the 20th century, but has ceased as a result of the country's political difficulties.
History.
The Ottoman Empire.
The first railway in Lebanon was built while Lebanon was part of the Ottoman Empire, with the French-established Société des Chemins de fer Ottomans économiques de Beyrouth-Damas-Hauran being granted a concession in 1891. This railway, which came to be known as DHP for Damas, Hamah et Prolonguements, was intended to link Beirut (now the capital of independent Lebanon) and Damascus (now the capital of neighbouring Syria), providing Damascus with port access. A contemporary British plan to link Damascus with Jaffa was seen as a threat to Beirut's status as the primary port of the northern Levant, and the French project was largely in response to this.
Track gauge.
The Beirut-Damascus line was built to a gauge, across mountainous terrain, and opened on 3 August 1895. The summit at Beidar 37 kilometres from Beirut was 1487 metres above sea level. To make this climb extensive sections of rack operation were used. At around the same time, a line from Riyaq to Aleppo via eastern Lebanon's Beqaa Valley was approved. Although it was intended to provide service between Damascus and Aleppo, it was built to standard gauge, and as a result, traffic between those two cities needed to change trains at Riyaq. In the north, the city of Tripoli was also connected to Homs (now in Syria).
World War II.
These lines continued to operate after the French replaced the Ottomans as the ruling power, and in World War II, the railways saw significant military use. Under British direction, the coastal line was linked to Haifa (in today's Israel, see "Coastal railway line") and extended to Tripoli (See "Tripoli Railway Station"), all in standard gauge — this meant that it was now theoretically possible to travel from Europe to north Africa without changing trains. except for a train ferry across the Bosphorus.
Lebanese independence.
When Lebanon obtained its independence, the parts of this rail system which were within its territory came into state control, eventually being organised as Chemin de Fer de l'Etat Libanais (CEL). CEL was formed in 1960. The Lebanese Civil War caused considerable damage to the rail network, however, and services gradually ceased. A 1974 article revealed that the 1.05 metre DHP system was still fully working but uncompetitive and loss making. It was entirely steam worked at the time. The last regular rail operations in Lebanon were trains carrying cement from Chekka to Beirut in 1997.
Cross border line.
A very short length of the Syrian Homs-Tartus line crosses the border into Lebanon. This happens because the railway was built before this border was defined. See top of map above.
Planned revival.
There have been a number of proposals for reviving the Lebanese railway system, but as yet, none have come to fruition.

Jeanne Cherhal

Jeanne Cherhal (born 28 February 1978 in Nantes) is a French singer-songwriter.
Biography.
After spending her younger years in Erbray near Châteaubriant, Cherhal studied philosophy before moving to Paris. She started her singing career playing piano – solo, or accompanied by her guitarist Éric Löhrer in small concert venues. At the time she sported long, plaîtted hair. After a six-title CD (edited by Madame Suzie), she released an album entitled "Jeanne Cherhal" with the independent label Tôt ou tard.
Little by little, her renown increased. At the beginning she sang Georges Moustaki, Jacques Higelin, Thomas Fersen and Emir Kusturica; she was invited on by the group les Têtes Raides, sang as a double act with Vincent Delerm and sometimes as a trio with d'Albin de La Simone. She also performed in a series of concerts with Matthieu Bouchet, which culminated in the production of the CD-booklet "même temps..." (produced in a limited edition of 1500 copies).
Cherhal's second album "Douze fois par an" (Twelve times a year), released in 2004; was a huge success. Along with this she received not only recognition from the music world, but also from a large and ever-increasing fan base.
Towards the end of 2005, she performed in the French version of "The Vagina Monologues"
In 2006 her third album, "L'eau" (Water), produced by Albin de la Simone. Musically speaking, it was much more polished and the themes contained at the same time more personal and more involved. This album would enable her once more to tour in France and abroad, performing in Belgium and Switzerland; in Berlin, London, Dublin and Beirut; in Canada, Congo, Central African Republic, in Gabon and in Angola.
In February 2008, inspired by "the famous text message", she placed a previously unheard track on her MySpace page: "Si tu reviens, j'annule tout"... (If you come back, I'll cancel everything...)
2008 would also mark Jeanne's first steps in the world of cinema as she would play the main rôle in two short films:
– La consultation (the consultation): directed by Frédérik Vin in the framework of the French television channel Canal+'s campaign "Ecrire pour un chanteur" (Write for a singer)
– La copie de Coralie (Coralie's Copy): directed by Nicolas Hengel, nominated at the Cannes Film Festival

Corbly Family Massacre

The Corbly Family Massacre refers to the massacre of members of the family of the Rev. John Corbly by Indians on May 10, 1782.
The Corbly family lived one mile north of Garards Fort, in southwest Pennsylvania at the John Corbley Farm. The massacre occurred on Sunday morning, May 10, 1782, as the Corbly family traveled on foot to their place of worship. The Corbly family had left their home and were on their way to worship at a place where Reverend John Corbly was to preach. When Corbly discovered that the Bible, which he thought was in Mrs. Corbly's care, had been left at home, he returned to get it and then followed his family, meditating upon the sermon he was to preach. 
A party of Indians were on Indian Point, an elevation of land from which they could see John Corbly's cabin. The Indians descended the hill, crossed Whitely creek and filed up a ravine to the place, about forty-nine rods north of the present John Corbly Memorial Baptist Church, where the helpless family was massacred. Two of Corbly's daughters, Delilah and Elizabeth, lived after scalpings. Mrs. Corbly and the three remaining children were killed. 
Because of the rise of ground the fort was out of view of the massacre, but was within hearing distance. The screams of the Corbly family were heard there and in a few minutes men on horseback rushed from the fort to give help. 
The John Corbly Memorial Baptist Church was built in 1862. A plaque erected by the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) in 1923 and set in a boulder reads: "Fort Garard built about 1774". The Corbly massacre took place about 279 yards north on May 10, 1782. A family reunion of John Corbly descendants takes place every year on the last Sunday in June, at the John Corbly Memorial Baptist Church in Garards Fort, PA. A historic review follows the 9:30 AM church service at 11:00 AM with a potluck dinner afterwards.
The family lived one mile north of Garards Fort in Long's Run, a tributary emptying into Whiteley Creek. The Monongahela River was five miles east of their cabin and Old Redstone Fort was thirty miles north. The Indians were on Lookout Point, west of the Corbly cabin. The Goshen Baptist Church was established in 1771 and was renamed the Reverend John Corbly Memorial Baptist Church in 1907. Delilah lived to age 65 and reared ten children with Levi Martin. Elizabeth died at age 21, a few days before she was to marry Isaiah Morris of Garards Fort. Only John Jr escaped unharmed.

Colorado State Highway 115

State Highway 115 is a state highway that runs from US 50 interchange in northern Cañon City to Interstate 25/ Nevada Avenue in Colorado Springs.
Route description.
Major construction has been done on the mountainous portion of the highway due a high amount of accidents because of lane narrowing. Highway 115 gives service through several small towns along the eastern mountains such as Florence and Penrose. It is the only highway that gives in/out service to Colorado Springs from Cañon City.
History.
The route was established in the 1920s, when it connected U.S. Highway 50 near Florence to Colorado Springs. By 1950, the west terminus was fixed to State Highway 120 . The US 50 interchange was built by 1977, when the entire route was paved. A small change in the routing near its east end occurred in 2007.
