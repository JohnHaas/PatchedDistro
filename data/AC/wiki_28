13.5 cm K 09

The 13.5 cm Kanone 09 (13.5 cm K 09) was a heavy breech-loading field artillery gun used by Germany in World War I. Built by Friedrich Krupp AG, in Essen, Germany, this gun was intended to supplement the 10 cm K 04. Only four were in service at the outbreak of the war. It was withdrawn from service in 1915 as it was deemed to be too much gun for too little shell, but it was returned to service later in the war when the Allied blockade began to affect German ammunition production.
One of these guns was captured during the Battle of the Canal du Nord, on 29 September 1918, by the New Zealand Division. Two battalions of the Wellington Regiment were engaged in this action, which was part of an Allied attack on the Hindenburg Line. At the end of the war, the captured gun, Nr 4, and many other captured German weapons were sent to New Zealand as war trophies. In 1920, Nr 4 was gifted to the city of Wellington in honor of its soldiers. The gun, believed to be the only one remaining in existence, is currently on public display in the Wellington Botanic Garden.

Sugarloaf Knob

Sugarloaf Knob is a well-known summit within Ohiopyle State Park on the south end of the Laurel Ridge. This mountain has a unique profile and can easily be recognized at different lookouts in the park and surrounding area. The Youghiogheny River cuts beneath the "knob" and Laurel Hill creating a deep chasm. The highest peak in the area is the south end of the Laurel Hill Ridge as it reaches above sea level. 
Sugarloaf Knob is easily accessible by a park road which takes you to just below the summit. A short bushwhack from there will get you to the top of the mountain.

William E. Dodge, Jr.

William Earl Dodge, Jr. (February 15, 1832 – August 9, 1903) was an American businessperson and philanthropist. For many years, he was one of two controlling partners in the Phelps Dodge Corporation, one of the largest copper mining corporations in the United States.
Early life.
William Earl Dodge, Jr. was born in New York City on February 15, 1832, the eldest son of William E. Dodge, Sr.. Dodge Sr. was a co-founder with his father-in-law, Anson Greene Phelps of the import firm of Phelps Dodge.
He married Sarah Hoadley, daughter of David Hoadley, president of the Panama Railroad Company, in 1854. The couple had at least three children, Cleveland Hoadley Dodge, Grace Hoadley Dodge and Mary Hoadley Dodge. Cleveland followed his father into the family business and founded the Cleveland H. Dodge Foundation in 1917. Grace later co-founded Teacher's College and was the first woman to sit on the New York City Board of Education.
He was very active during the Civil War, becoming a member of the Union League Club and an advisor to the Women's Central Association of Relief. His service on a commission of the State of New York to supervise the conditions of New York State troops in the field led the New York Legislature to pass a resolution honoring him for his work.
In 1863, Dodge built Greyston, a gambrel-roofed Gothic Revival mansion of granite designed by James Renwick, Jr., in Riverdale, Bronx, New York City. With Lyndhurst, Tarrytown, and Ingleside, Dobbs Ferry, it is one of only three mid-nineteenth century survivors along the intensely redeveloped lower Hudson. His Dodge heirs donated it in 1961 as a conference center for Teachers College, Columbia University, who used it until the 1970s, then sold it to Zen Buddhist Community, who sold it again.
Work career.
He began working for the Phelps Dodge Corporation, and in 1864 was named a Partner in the firm.
Dodge and his cousin, Daniel Willis James, transformed the Phelps Dodge company from a placid and profitable import business into one of the world's largest and wealthiest mining corporations. The Phelps Dodge company had decided to enter the mining industry, and hired professor of chemistry James Douglas to make an inspection of mining claims in the Southwestern United States. Douglas suggested that the two men invest in the Detroit Copper Mining Company of Arizona, which owned a copper mining claim in Warren, Arizona. In 1881, Phelps Dodge not only took a controlling interest in the Detroit Copper Mining Company but also purchased a minority interest in the adjoining Copper Queen Mine in Bisbee, Arizona. After the Copper Queen and Detroit Copper both struck the Atlanta lode in 1884, Phelps Dodge bought out the remaining interest in the Copper Queen. The company merged its various mining interests into the Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company in 1885, and installed Douglas as president and part-owner. With production in the Bisbee expanding, Dodge and his business partners formed the Arizona and South Eastern Railroad (later more widely known as the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad) in 1888. In time, Dodge sat on the board of directors of a number of mining, railroad, real estate, water, and other companies, and Phelps Dodge was on its way to becoming one of the largest mining companies in the world.
Dodge had other interests outside of Phelps Dodge, too. He was a leader of the Ansonia Clock Company, American Brass Company, Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company, Lackawanna Steel Company, Morningside Realty Company, United Globe Mines, and the New York Life Insurance Company. He was vice president of the New York Chamber of Commerce at the time of his death.
Philanthropic work.
A Presbyterian, Dodge was president of the American branch of the Evangelical Alliance and the National Temperance Society (as his father was before him), and vice-president of the American Sunday School Union. He was active in the New York City chapter of the Young Men's Christian Association, and led the efforts to build the chapter's first and second buildings.
He was chairman of the National Arbitration Committee, and helped raised funds for and guide the Metropolitan Museum of Art (he was chairman of the Executive Committee), the American Museum of Natural History (he was vice-president for a time), and the New York Botanical Garden
He was a member of the Linnean Society, American Historical Association, New York Academy of Sciences, American Fine Arts Society, New York Geographical Society, New-York Historical Society, the New England Society of New York, the Century Association, and the National Academy of Design.
Death.
William E. Dodge, Jr. died of heart failure on August 9, 1903, at his home in Bar Harbor, Maine.

Pandora (musical group)

Pandora are a female Mexican singing trio. The original line-up consisted of sisters Isabel Lascurain and Mayte Lascurain and their cousin Fernanda Meade. 
Background.
During their school years, the Lascurain sisters and some friends participated as a group in various music festivals, calling themselves "Las Jeans". Later, Fernanda Meade, a family friend, joined Isabel and Mayte to form a trio called "Trebol". Under this name they recorded an album for RCA Victor in 1981 entitled "El Día Que Me Quieras" (The Day That You Love Me). The album was produced for distribution among employees of a renowned company.
From 1981 to 1984 the trio established itself doing backup vocals for artists such as Emmanuel and Pedro Vargas (who is the sisters' godfather), and backup vocals for the group Timbiriche. On November 29, 1984, the trio was given the opportunity to sign a record deal with EMI. The artistic director of EMI Capitol Mexico, Luis Moyano, christened the group "Pandora", the first female trio in Mexico in thirty years. In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman created on the earth.
Meade left the group in May 1989 to pursue a solo career, returning to the group in 1997; during this time, her place was taken by Liliana Aboroa.
Fame and Legacy.
Their signature song is a composition by singer-songwriter Hernaldo Zúñiga titled "¿Cómo te va mi amor?" (Eng.: "How is it going my love?") which was recently included on the VH1 countdown of the 100 Best Songs of the 80s in Spanish at number 16. 
Pandora peaked at number one in the "Billboard" Hot Latin Tracks in 1993 with their rendition of "Without You", titled "Desde el Día Que Te Fuiste", taken from their cover album "Ilegal". The album received a nomination for Pop Album at the Lo Nuestro Awards of 1993 and Pandora won for Pop Group of the Year.
Pandora's music can be classified as Latin Pop, though some of their later albums feature much more traditional Mexican composition. Pandora borrows heavily from other performers and songwriters. The trio has covered many songs of Juan Gabriel, Manuel Alejandro, and Hernaldo Zúñiga. These covers make up a large part of their performance repertoire.
After issuing Pandora Otra Vez in 1986, Fernanda Meade, Isabel Lascurian, and Mayte Lascurian had the opportunity to perform live in the U.S. while participating in a tribute to Plácido Domingo at Los Angeles' Universal Amphitheater, moving to Europe to make Huellas a year later. While touring America to promote Hace Tres Noches Apenas, a traditional Mexican music album, Pandora's live performance at Mexico City's Metropolitan Theater was recorded on May 8, 1998, released as Pandora 1985/1998. 
To celebrate the 25th anniversary of their debut, the three original members of Pandora reunited in 2010 to release a new album, "Pandora.. de plata," which consisted of covers, duets, and re-recordings of their old hits.

Don Quixote de la Mancha (1947 film)

Don Quixote de la Mancha (orig. Spanish title "Don Quijote de la Mancha") is the first sound film version in Spanish of the great classic novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. It was directed and adapted by Rafael Gil and released in 1947. A huge undertaking for Spanish cinema in its day, it was the longest film version of the novel up to that time (two hours and twelve minutes, plus an intermission), and very likely the most faithful, reverently following the book in its dialogue and order of episodes, unlike G.W. Pabst's 1933 version and the later Russian film version, which scrambled up the order of the adventures as many film versions do. Characters such as Cardenio, Dorotea, and Don Fernando, which are usually omitted because their respective subplots have little to do with the main body of the novel, were kept in this film.
The film, which starred Rafael Rivelles as Don Quixote and Juan Calvo as Sancho Panza, featured a young Fernando Rey as Sanson Carrasco and popular Spanish actress Sara Montiel as Antonia, Quixote's niece. The music for the film was composed by Ernesto Halffter, and the movie was shot on location in La Mancha and other Spanish regions.
It did not fare as well in the United States, where it opened in 1949, as it had in Spain. In its American runs, it was whittled down to a more customary length of 107 minutes.

<doc id="18920021" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18920021" title="Caracoles">
Caracoles

The Caracol people are an English-based creole speaking people who have been established in Northern Honduras (specifically, the Bay Islands) since the early 19th century and are mainly of European English-Caribbean descent. Caracol is a Spanish term that literally translates as conch, snail or shell, and relates the people of the Bay Islands to their unique environment and their seafaring culture. In its current usage, the term Caracol refers to all people born in the Bay Islands region, and their descendants. The region of the Bay Islands encompasses the three major islands of Roatán, Útila, Guanaja, and the smaller Islands or keys.
History.
The first known English-speaking groups to settle in the Bay Islands are believed to have originated from the Cayman Islands near Jamaica. They arrived in the 1830s shortly after the end of slavery in British territories disrupted the economic structure that had maintained Caymanian culture. Caymanians were largely a seafaring culture and were familiar with the area from turtle fishing ventures and other activities. 
The islands' population grew steadily in the latter half of the 19th century, and new settlements became established all over Roatán and the other islands. Individual settlers came from all over the world and played a part in developing and shaping the face of the Caracol culture. A fruit trade industry started by islanders became very profitable and by the 1870s was taken over by American interests, most notably the New Orleans and Bay Islands Fruit Company. Later companies, the Standard Fruit and United Fruit Companies, became the foundation for modern day fruit companies, the industry which gave Honduras the sobriquet "banana republic".
The Bay Islands.
The Bay Islands were first discovered by Christopher Columbus on his fourth voyage to America in 1502. They were later claimed, and successively held, by England, Spain, and the Dutch United Provinces. England finally took control in 1643 and, with the exception of a one-month period of Spanish dominance in 1780, held onto them as a Crown colony, dependent on Jamaica. In 1860, in the aftermath of the William Walker filibustering affair, the British crown recognized Honduran sovereignty and ceded possession of the Bay Islands. The department of "Islas de la Bahía" was officially incorporated to Honduras on 14 March 1872.
Economy.
Traditionally, the economy of the Bay Islands region has consisted of industrial fishing, remittances from merchant marine activities, and, more recently, tourism.
Language.
The English language spoken by the Caracol changed over time from the English spoken by the first European settlers to arrive in Roatán. The language differs mostly in morphology but also in pronunciation and accent and, to a lesser extent, in syntax and vocabulary, from that of the other British colonies, although the languages are still similar enough to be mutually intelligible.

Tony Andre Hansen (born 23 February 1979, in Sandefjord) is a Norwegian show jumper and musician.
Beijing Olympics Controversy.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Hansen initially won the bronze medal as part of the Norwegian team in team jumping, together with Morten Djupvik, Stein Endresen, and Geir Gulliksen.
However, after failing the first of two doping tests, neither Hansen or his horse, Camiro, was allowed to participate in the individual jumping competition. The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) provisionally suspended the horse after detecting the illegal substance capsaicin in his urine. If the second, or B, test was also found positive for capsaicin, Norway would likely lose the bronze medal the equestrian team won on 18 August 2008.
On 28 August it was announced that the B test was also positive. A hearing on the doping charges was held in Lausanne, Switzerland on 6 September; the FEI then had 28 days to make a decision with regards to the charges. Without new evidence to clear Hansen, he and the other members of the Norwegian Olympic equestrian team would lose the bronze medals.
As the FEI hearings began Hansen was cautiously optimistic, stating that the amounts of capsaicin found on his horse "could have entered the horse's system without any doping substance itself being used". However, on 22 December 2008, the FEI returned their verdict: Hansen was found guilty of the doping charge and he will be suspended from the sport for four and a half months. The Norwegian team was stripped of their bronze medal; the Swiss team, who placed fourth, are now the bronze medal winners. Hansen has appealed the verdict to the Court of Arbitration for Sport; their ruling is expected by May 2009.
Personal life.
He is the guitarist and background singer of the band "Ovation".
Hansen is married to moderator Jessica Almenäs. The couple has a son (* 2009).

Ministry of Tourism (Lebanon)

The Ministry of Tourism () is a government ministry of Lebanon. It originates from the Lebanon Tourism Service created in the 1930s as part of the Ministry of National Economy.
History.
After Lebanese independence, the General Tourism Commission (CGT or "Commissariat Général du Tourisme, de l'Estivage et de l'Hivernage" in French) was created in 1948 to monitor tourism professions and promote Lebanese tourism abroad.
In 1959, the CGT was annexed by the Ministry of Information which became the Ministry of Information, Orientation, and Tourism. However, it was the National Tourism Council (CNT or "Conseil National du Tourisme" in French), a private organization, which effectively promoted tourism in Lebanon.
The growth of tourism on a global scale led to the creation of the Ministry of Tourism in 1966 (Law 21/66, issued on March 29, 1966), composed of the General Directorate of Tourism ("Direction Générale des Affaires Touristiques").
Decree no. 7142 was issued on April 20, 1967, defining the specific tasks that fell under the separate responsibility of the National Tourism Council, including overseas promotion and execution of tourism projects. However, this decree was repealed by Decree no. 2829, issued on October 10, 1992, which transferred these tasks to the Ministry of Tourism.
Minister.
The current minister of tourism is Michel Faraoun.

Nicolaas Wilhelmus Posthumus

Nicolaas Wilhelmus Posthumus or N.W. Posthumus (February 26, 1880, Amsterdam–April 18, 1960, Bussum) was a Dutch economic historian and political scientist. In 1915, he founded and published the Economisch-Historisch Jaarboek—a yearly collection of primary source documents and empirical analysis of Dutch merchant records. Following the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, Posthumus founded the International Institute of Social History in 1935 as a place to retain socialist documents and histories safe from the Nazi regime and other governments which might exert control over them. When Germany invaded the Netherlands the activities of the institute were disrupted. He was dismissed in 1942 by the government of the occupied Netherlands and returned to his post only following the war. During the war he managed to publish "Inquiry into the History of Prices in Holland. Vol. i", an exhaustive empirical study of market prices and rates of exchange in Amsterdam from the 16th century until the First World War. The work was favorably received and remains his most widely cited to date.
After the war he wrote a history of the German occupation of the Netherlands entitled "The Netherlands During German Occupation". He worked with various institutes, including the Dutch Institute for War Documentation and held a full professorship in Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Amsterdam until 1949, when he resigned to head the Brill publishing house. The N.W. Posthumus Instituut, a graduate research facility in economics at the University of Groningen, was founded in 1988 in his honor.

<doc id="18920203" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18920203" title="Igbo calendar">
Igbo calendar

The Igbo calendar () is the traditional calendar system of the Igbo people which has 13 months in a year, 7 weeks in a month, and 4 days in a week plus an extra day at the end of the year. The calendar has its roots steeped in ritualism and symbolism; many parts of the Igbo calendar are named or dedicated to certain spirits () and deities () in the Igbo mythology. Some of the spirits and deities were believed to have given the Igbo people knowledge of time. The days, also known as market day, also correspond to the four cardinal points, north, south, east, west.
Although worship and spirit honoring was a very big part in the creation and development of the Igbo calendar system, commerce also played a major role in creating the Igbo calendar. This was emphasized in Igbo mythology itself. An example of this is the Igbo market days of which each community has a day assigned to open its markets, this way the Igbo calendar is still in use. The Nri-Igbo yearly counting festival known as Igu Aro marked March 10, 2012 as the beginning of the 1013th year of the Nri calendar.
System.
In the traditional Igbo calendar a week () has 4 days () ("Eke", "Orie", "Afọ", "Nkwọ"), seven weeks make one month (), a month has 28 days and there are 13 months a year. In the last month, an extra day is added. The traditional time keepers in Igboland are the priests or "Dibia".
The names of the day's have their roots in the mythology of the Kingdom of Nri. Eri, the sky-descended founder of the Nri kingdom, had gone on to break the mystery of time and on his journey he had saluted and counted the four days by the names of the spirits that governed them, hence the names of the spirits "eke", "orie", "afọ" and "nkwọ" became those of the days of the week. The days also correspond to the four cardinal points, Afọ corresponds to north, Nkwọ to south, eke to east, and orie to west. These spirits, who were fishmongers, were sent down by Chukwu (Great God) in order to establish markets throughout Igboland which they did by selling fish.
An example of a month: Ọnwa Mbụ
Naming after dates.
Newborn babies are sometimes named after the day they were born on, though this is no longer commonly used. Names such as "Mgbeke" (maiden on the day of Eke), Mgborie (maiden [born on the Orie day) and so on were common among the Igbo people. For males "Mgbo" is replaced by "Oko" (Igbo: Male child or "Nwa" (Igbo: Child [of). An example of this is Nwankwo Kanu, a popular footballer.
Months and meanings.
The following months are in reference to the Nri-Igbo calendar of the Nri kingdom which may differ from other Igbo calendars in terms of naming, rituals, and ceremonies surrounding the months.
Ọnwa Mbụ.
The first month starts from the third week of February making it the Igbo new year. The Nri-Igbo calendar year corresponding to the Gregorian year of 2012 was initially slated to begin with the annual year-counting festival known as Igu Aro on February 18 (an Nkwọ day on the third week of February), but was postponed to March 10 due to local government elections in Anambra State where the Nri kingdom is located. The Igu Aro festival which was held in March marked the lunar year as the 1013th recorded year of the Nri calendar.

Typhoon Nuri (2008)

Typhoon Nuri (international designation: 0812, JTWC designation: 13W, PAGASA name: Karen) was the 12th named storm and the seventh typhoon that was recognised by the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center recognised it as the 13th tropical depression, the 12th tropical storm and the 8th typhoon of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season. The name Nuri was submitted to the World Meteorological Organisation's Typhoon Committee by Malaysia in 2003 after the name Rusa was retired in 2002. The name Nuri is Malay for a blue crowned parroquet, a type of parrot. The name Karen was assigned by PAGASA to a tropical depression for the second time, the other time being in 2004 to Typhoon Rananim.
Typhoon Nuri formed as a tropical depression on August 17 with the JMA then designating it as Tropical Storm Nuri the next day. It reached typhoon status later that day. Nuri then made landfall in the Philippines as a typhoon on August 20 leaving at least 10 people dead and 11 injured. Nuri then emerged into the South China Sea the next day and started moving towards Southern China. As Nuri moved closer towards Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued its Increasing Gale or Storm Signal No. 9 for the first time since Typhoon Dujuan in 2003. Typhoon Nuri then made a direct hit on Hong Kong as a typhoon. The JMA issued its final warning on August 23 as Typhoon Nuri was moving into Southern China.
Meteorological history.
Early on August 16 a tropical disturbance developed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean to the northeast of Guam. It was initially forecast that it would not develop into a tropical cyclone by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, but later that day the JTWC forecast for it to become a tropical cyclone within 24 hours and so issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. On August 17 the disturbance became more organized and intensified into a tropical depression when it was located to the east of the Philippines. The JTWC designated it as 13W. Later that day both the JMA and PAGASA identified the tropical depression and started to issue full advisories on the depression with PAGASA assigning the name Karen to the depression.
The depression then rapidly intensified into a tropical storm with the JTWC upgrading it that day whilst the JMA and PAGASA did so the day after. When the JMA designated the depression as a tropical storm it was assigned the name Nuri and the international designation of 0810 by the RSMC in Tokyo. This rapid intensification continued with the JMA designating it as a severe tropical storm on August 18; then they, along with JTWC and PAGASA, upgraded it to a typhoon.
Late on August 19 Nuri made its first landfall on the coast of Cagayan Province in northern Luzon. Nuri then entered the Babuyan Channel early the next day and started to move northwestwards towards the southeastern coast of China. On August 21 PAGASA released its final advisory on Typhoon Karen (Nuri) as Nuri moved out of its area of responsibility and moved towards Hong Kong. The JMA then downgraded Nuri to a severe tropical storm with the JTWC also downgrading Nuri to a tropical storm later that day. The JMA did not downgrade Nuri to a tropical storm until the next morning when Nuri had made a rare direct hit on Hong Kong. The JTWC then issued its final advisory on Nuri and the JMA then downgraded Nuri to a weak tropical depression early the next day and issued its last full advisory on Nuri just as it was moving into the Chinese mainland.
Preparations.
Philippines.
PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signals 1 to 3 all across Northern and Central Luzon. The areas initially issued of Storm Signal number 1 are the Cagayan and Isabela provinces. However as the storm tracked nearer to Cagayan, more areas were put under storm signals 1, 2 and 3. PAGASA issued warnings on Karen until 21 August.
On August 19 the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) proclaimed suspension of classes on the 19th and 20 August for the following regions: Central Luzon, Ilocos region and National Capital Region as PAGASA had forecast that these regions would be affected by Typhoon Karen (Nuri).
Hong Kong.
On August 20 as Typhoon Nuri moved away from the Philippines towards southern China, The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) issued the Standby Signal No. 1 as Typhoon Nuri was centred within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong. Late the next day the HKO issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 as Typhoon Nuri had tracked closer towards Hong Kong. On August 22, the HKO issued the Northwest Gale or Storm Signal No. 8 at 07:40 (HKT). Later that day at 13:40 (HKT) the HKO hoisted the Increasing Storm Signal No. 9 at 13:40 (HKT) The HKO then warned that they would be forced to hoist their first Hurricane Signal No. 10 since Typhoon York in 1999 if Nuri maintained its strength.
However, as Nuri had weakened slightly, the HKO did not need to issue their highest wind signal. The HKO kept the Increasing Storm Signal No. 9 stayed in force for 11 hours, which is longer than any other No. 9 signals on record. Before they lowered it to the Southwest Gale or Storm Signal No. 8 on August 23 which was in force for 2 hours before it was downgraded to the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 and was downgraded to the Standby Signal No. 1 signal at 09:40 {HKT}. All signals were cancelled at 11.15 am {HKT} 
Impact.
Philippines.

James Gary "Jim" Propp is a professor of mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
In high school, Propp was one of the national winners of the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), and an alumnus of the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics. Propp obtained his A.B. in mathematics in 1982 at Harvard. After advanced study at Cambridge, he obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. He has held professorships at seven universities, including Harvard, MIT, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
Propp is the co-editor of the book "Microsurveys in Discrete Probability" (1998) and has written more than thirty journal articles on game theory, combinatorics and probability, and recreational mathematics. He lectures extensively and has served on the Mathematical Olympiad Committee of the Mathematical Association of America, which sponsors the USAMO. In the early 90s Propp lived in Boston and later in Arlington, Massachusetts.
In 1996, Propp and David Wilson invented coupling from the past, a method for sampling from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain among Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Contrary to many MCMC algorithms, coupling from the past gives in principle a perfect sample from the stationary distribution. His papers have discussed the use of surcomplex numbers in game theory; the solution to the counting of alternating sign matrices; and occurrences of Grandi's series as an Euler characteristic of infinite-dimensional real projective space.
Propp is a member of the National Puzzlers' League under the nom Aesop. He was recruited for the organization by colleague Henri Picciotto, cruciverbalist and co-author of the league's first cryptic crossword collection. Propp is the creator of the "Self-Referential Aptitude Test", a humorous multiple-choice test in which all questions except the last make self-references to their own answers. It was created in the early 90s for a puzzlers' party.
Propp is the author of "Tuscanini", a 1992 children's book about a musical elephant, illustrated by Ellen Weiss.
He is married to research psychologist Alexandra (Sandi) Gubin. They have a son Adam and a daughter Eliana.

The Press were one of the first Oi! bands in the United States. Formed in New York City in 1984, the outspoken anti-fascist band was associated with Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice, of which their singer, André Schlesinger, was an early member. Schlesinger also supported the views of the British Socialist Workers Party, and this was reflected in some of the band's lyrics. Their songs appeared on several compilation albums, as well as in a full CD collection of their recordings called "The Complete Press: 1984-1994", released by Insurgence Records with liner notes by Garry Bushell.

Yesterday's Enemy

"Yesterday's Enemy" is a 1959 Hammer Films British war film directed by Val Guest and starring Stanley Baker, Guy Rolfe, Leo McKern and Gordon Jackson set in the Burma Campaign during World War II. It is based on a 1958 BBC teleplay by Peter R. Newman who turned it into a three act play in 1960. Gordon Jackson repeated his role from the BBC teleplay as Sgt. Ian Mackenzie. Columbia Pictures co-produced the film with Hammer Films in an agreement for five co-productions a year with Columbia providing half the finance. The film was shot on indoor sets in black and white and Megascope. The film has no musical score.
The TV play was reportedly based on a war crime perpetrated by a British army captain in Burma in 1942.
Plot.
The lost remnants of a Brigade headquarters make their way through the Burmese jungle following a retreat. Separated from their other units and without radio communication the survivors led by Captain Langford (Stanley Baker) stumble into a Burmese village held by a small group of Japanese soldiers. After finishing them off they are mystified that among the dead 10 Japanese is a full Colonel. They also discover a map with various positions marked in code and a Burmese collaborator who only talks after Captain Langford orders two villagers shot by a firing squad. The Burmese explains the map is a Japanese plan of attack against the British but the patrol had no way to get the information out unless they leave their wounded behind or fix their radio.
Other information.
The film ends with the Kohima epitaph: 
The verse is attributed to John Maxwell Edmonds (1875–1958), and is thought to have been inspired by the epitaph written by Simonides to honour the Spartans who fell at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.

<doc id="18920332" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18920332" title="Prussian G 12">
Prussian G 12

The Prussian G 12 was a 2-10-0 goods train locomotive with the Prussian state railways ("Preußische Staatseisenbahnen"). 
It was built because it had been shown during the First World War that it was a great disadvantage, from a servicing and maintenance point of view, for each state railway to have its own locomotive classes with no standardization. In addition, the military railways needed a fast, powerful, goods train locomotive, that did not, however, have a high axle load.
Design.
The G 12 was based on the Prussian G 12.1 and a 2-10-0 locomotive built for the Imperial Ottoman Department for Military Railways ("Kaiserlich Ottomanische Generaldirektion der Militäreisenbahnen" or "C.F.O.A.") by Henschel (see Prussian G 12 (C.F.O.A)).
The locomotives differed in several points from earlier principles for Prussian locomotive design. Firstly they had a continuous bar frame and a wide, outer, Belpaire firebox located above the frame with a large grate area.
Construction.
Between August 1917 and 1921, a total of 1,168 G 12s were procured by Prussia. The Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine ordered 118, the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway 88, the Royal Saxon State Railways 42 and the Royal Württemberg State Railways 42 engines. In addition, Baden bought 10 locomotives from the Prussian state railways. Even the Deutsche Reichsbahn receive a batch of 20 locomotives in 1924 that, following the Saxon XIII H, were given the numbers 58 443-462.
The Saxon locomotives were, like their predecessors, designated as Class XIII H; Baden and Württemberg took on the Prussian designation of G 12. Only the Bavarian State Railways, the railways of Mecklenburg and Oldenburg did not buy any G 12s; as a result the G 12 can be viewed as the precursor to the standard locomotives or "Einheitsloks" in Germany.
Deutsche Reichsbahn.
The majority of locomotives of this class were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. There they were given the following operating numbers:
Number 58 1001 was not a G 12, rather an engine for the C.F.O.A. left in Germany.
Coal dust firing.
Around 1930, six engines were converted to coal dust firing and, after 1945, a number of other engines followed suit, of which 43 remained in service for a long time (up to 1968).
World War II.
In World War II, 58 2144 from Poland and 58 2145-2148 from Luxembourg were incorporated.
The Deutsche Bundesbahn retired their units in 1953. The East German Deutsche Reichsbahn still had 300 machines in service in 1968. On the introduction of EDP numbers in 1970, a '1' was usually prefixed to three-digit operating numbers. The last locomotives were mustered out in 1976. 56 locomotives were converted by the Deutsche Reichsbahn to Class 58.30 "Rekoloks" between 1958 and 1962. 
After World War II, locomotives 58 1669, 1746, 1767, 1904, 1917, 2122 and 2132 remained on Austrian national territory. Number 58 1669 was given back to the DB in 1949, 58 1904 was paid off in 1951 and 58 1917 ended up in the Soviet Union in 1949. The remaining four engines formed the Austrian ÖBB Class 658. All the engines were retired by 1966. However at least one example (658.2122) survived longer in use as a heating locomotive and was still at Linz depot in February 1976 albeit dumped and carrying the number 01042.
The locomotives remaining in Poland after 1945 were given the PKP class Ty1. Those in Yugoslavia became class 36.
Tenders.
The G 12 was mainly equipped with Prussian class 3 T 20 or 2'2' T 31.5 tenders. The Saxon XIII H, on the other hand, generally ran with the somewhat larger Saxon class 3 T 21 tenders, resulting in a greater overall length. Because water tank volume was reduced on conversion to coal dust firing, only large Prussian 2'2' T 31.5 tenders or standard tenders were used after the war.
Preservation.
Today, two former Baden locomotives of the older type, 58 261 (Bw Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf) and 58 311 (Ettlingen), and a Prussian original, 58 1616 (formerly used as a steam generator ("Dampfspender") (Bw Hermeskeil), remain preserved. See the List of preserved steam locomotives in Germany.

Huddersfield Town's 1970–71 campaign was Town's first season in the Football League's top division since the 1955–56 season. Following the successful previous season in Division 2. They finished in 15th place, but only finished 9 points clear of the relegation zone. They had some brilliant results during the season including a 2–1 win over champions and FA Cup winners. Arsenal. They were even top of the table after 2 matches following wins over Blackpool and Southampton. The stay in the top would only last one more season, following the dramatic slide the following season.
Review.
After a successful previous season, Town started their Division 1 lives with convincing 3–0 & 3–1 wins over Blackpool & Southampton respectively. Those wins actually put Town top of the table, but they were soon put back into place with a 4–0 drubbing by Liverpool at Anfield. They had a pretty mixed season, but they were never in any danger of being dragged into a relegation dogfight. One of their most impressive wins was a 2–1 win over Arsenal in January 1971. Goals by Les Chapman and Frank Worthington in between a Ray Kennedy equalizer gave Town a win over the eventual league and FA Cup winners.
Town finished in 15th place, despite only winning 11 games all season. They had 36 points, but never looked like getting relegated or fighting for a European place.

The Four-Story Mistake

The Four-Story Mistake (1942) is a children's novel by award-winning author Elizabeth Enright. The second of her four books about the Melendy family, it is preceded by "The Saturdays", and is followed by "Then There Were Five", and "".
Plot.
The four Melendy children live with their father, a widowed professor of economics, and Cuffy, their beloved housekeeper. During the height of World War II, the Melendy family moves out of New York City and into the countryside. Miranda "Randy", the third child, dislikes change and is saddened by the move. But the house they move into turns out to be an adventure. Called by locals "The Four-Story Mistake", it is an odd-looking house with a rich architectural history, surrounded by the country. 
The four Melendy children soon find adventure discovering the many hidden attractions of the house. Oliver discovers buried history, Rush is stranded in a tree during a storm, Randy finds a diamond in the most unlikely of places, and Mona learns what it truly means to be an actress. None of them could have guessed at the secret hidden in their very own play space, the office—a secret that had been shut away for over 60 years.
Reception.
"The Saturday Review" called "The Four-Story Mistake" "Special because
of its uncontrived, carefree humor and its modern appeal to everyone". "Kirkus Reviews" gave it a starred review for "books of remarkable merit" and praised it for "Plenty of action and incident; good dialogue; and a feel for people and the things they think and do".

Anna Shchetinina

Shchetinina was born at the Okeanskaya Station near Vladivostok in a family of a railway switchman. In 1925 she entered the navigation department of the Vladivostok Marine School (Владивостокский морской техникум). After graduation she worked with a shipping company in Kamchatka Peninsula, where she started as an Ordinary Seaman (or, rather, "Seawoman"), and rose to a captain. At the age of 24 she received her navigator's license (qualifying her for a position equivalent to a Second Mate in the Western merchant marines), and at 27 became the world's first female captain of an ocean-going ship. She attracted international attention on her first voyage as a captain (in 1935), as a young woman in charge of MV "Chavycha" on its journey from Hamburg (where it had just been purchased) to the Russian Far East around Europe, Africa, and Asia.
On March 20, 1938, Shchetinina became the first chief manager of the Vladivostok fishing port. Later the same year, however, she went back to school, now at Leningrad Ship Transport Institute (Ленинградский институт водного транспорта).
She participated in World War II in the Baltic, where her ship was evacuating people from Tallinn and transporting war cargoes under enemy bombardment.
Later during the war she was the master of a Liberty ship moving Lend-lease supplies across the Pacific from the USA to Soviet Far Eastern ports.
After the War Ms. Shchetinina served as the captain of MV "Askold", "Baskunchak", "Beloostrov", "Dniester", "Pskov", and "Mendeleev" of the Soviet Baltic Shipping Company. Since in 1949 she taught in the Leningrad Marine Engineering College (Ленинградское высшее инженерно-морское училище); in 1951 she became a senior instructor there, and later, the Dean of the Institute's Navigation Department. In 1956 she was granted the title of "docent." In 1960 she accepted the position of a "docent" (associate professor) at the Department of Sea Craft" (Морское дело]) at Vladivostok Marine Engineering and Navigation College (Владивостокское высшее инженерное мореходное училище).
Anna Ivanovna Shchetinina was awarded the medal of the Hero of Socialist Labor, which was one of the two highest awards of the USSR. She was also honored as a Distinguished Worker of the Merchant Marine (Почетный работник Морского флота) an honorary citizen of Vladivostok, an honorary member of the Far-Eastern Association of Shipmasters and The International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations (IFSMA), and received a number of other national and international awards.
She published a book entitled "On the Seas and Beyond the Seas" («На морях и за морями»), and was admitted as a member into the Union of Russian Writers.
A monument in honor of A.I. Shchetinina has been erected in the old Maritime Cemetery in Vladivostok. On October 20, 2006
Cape Shchetinina on the shore of the Amur Bay of the Sea of Japan was named in her honor.

Lurasidone

Lurasidone (trade name Latuda) is an atypical antipsychotic developed by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma and marketed by Sunovion in the USA. In USA, it is also approved for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression) in adults when used alone or in combination with lithium or valproate.
Medical uses.
Lurasidone is FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. It has not yet received regulatory approval in Australia or the UK. It received EMA approval on January 24, 2014. It was launched in Canada for the treatment of schizophrenia in September 2012, Health Canada giving their Summary Basis of Decision (SBD) as favourable on October 15, 2012. Switzerland is the first and only European country so far where lurasidone is approved for schizophrenia.
In July 2013 lurasidone received approval for bipolar I depression. Few available atypical antipsychotics are known to possess antidepressant efficacy in bipolar disorder (with the notable exceptions being quetiapine, olanzapine and "maybe" asenapine) as a monotherapy, even though the majority of atypical antipsychotics are known to possess significant antimanic activity, which is yet to be clearly demonstrated for lurasidone.
Lurasidone may be useful for treating the cognitive and memory deficits seen in schizophrenia. In animal studies, it reversed dizocilpine-induced learning and memory impairment and was found to be superior in doing this to all of the other antipsychotics examined, including risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, aripiprazole, and haloperidol. Lurasidone has activity at several serotonin receptors that are involved in learning and memory, and unlike most other antipsychotics, lacks any anticholinergic effects (which are known to impair cognitive processes and memory). These properties may underlie its improved effectiveness in treating these symptoms relative to older agents.
It is undergoing phase III clinical trial for extended use study in India, although it is not yet approved in India.
Adverse effects.
Side effects are generally similar to other antipsychotics. The drug has a relatively well-tolerated side effect profile, with low propensity for QTc interval changes, weight and lipid-related adverse effects. In a recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs it was found to produce the second least (after haloperidol) weight gain, the least QT interval prolongation, the fourth most extrapyramidal side effects (after haloperidol, zotepine and chlorpromazine) and the sixth least sedation (after paliperidone, sertindole, amisulpride, iloperidone and aripiprazole).
As with other atypical neuroleptics, lurasidone should be used with caution in the elderly because it puts them at an increased risk for a stroke or transient ischemic attack; however, these risks are not likely to be greater than those associated with antipsychotics of other classes.
Adverse effect incidence.
"Sources:"
Pharmacology.
Pharmacodynamics.
Lurasidone acts as an antagonist of the following sites:
And as a partial agonist of the following sites:
"Note: All values are rounded to the nearest tenth."
It has only weak or negligible actions at the H1, and mACh receptors.
Pharmacokinetics.
Lurasidone is metabolized in the liver via the enzyme CYP3A4. This means that its plasma concentrations may be increased when combined with CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole or grapefruit juice, possibly leading to more side effects. Co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers like rifampicin or St. John's wort can reduce plasma levels and consequently decrease the effects of the drug.
Chemical synthesis.
The large scale synthesis of lurasidone began with the bis-mesylation of commercially available diol 1 to furnish disulfone 2. Dialkylation of piperazine 3 with disulfone 2 under basic conditions afforded spirocyclic tetralkyl ammonium species 4. By subjecting tetralkyl ammonium salt 4 to basic conditions in the presence of succinimide 5 an interesting regioselective ring-opening alkylation reaction occurs to form the 1,2-"trans"-substituted cyclohexane motif of lurasidone. Finally, exposure of lurasidone to hydrochloric acid provided the lurasidone hydrochloride salt.

Newfoundland Herald

The Newfoundland Herald is a weekly magazine available throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, published in St. John's. Owned by Stirling Communications International, a company run by Geoff Stirling, the "Herald" is part news magazine, part entertainment magazine, and includes television listings for the province. It is generally distributed in convenience stores, supermarkets, and through door-to-door delivery.
Founded as "The Sunday Herald" on May 12, 1946, the "Herald" was originally a tabloid newspaper with, in Stirling's words, "a little something for everyone". After Stirling's CJON-TV came on the air, the publication's focus gradually shifted towards celebrity and entertainment features, eventually switching to a magazine format, and becoming Newfoundland's primary source of TV listings. ("TV Guide" was never widely available in the province.) Since the early 2000s, current events-related items and cover stories have been more common, as the publication seeks to reduce its dependence on the TV listings aspects given the growing influence of electronic program guides. Presently, new issues of the "Herald" are generally released on Monday and dated the following Sunday, with listings running Sunday to Saturday.
The "Herald" frequently cross-promotes with sister media outlets NTV and OZ FM; NTV programs are featured frequently (sometimes, in the case of NTV's newscasts, multiple times a year) on the "Herald"'s front cover, whereas competing channels' shows are seldom featured.

Francis Herbert Wenham

__NOTOC__
Francis Herbert Wenham (1824, Kensington – 1908) was a British marine engineer who studied the problem of manned flight and wrote a perceptive and influential academic paper which he presented to the first meeting of the Royal Aeronautical Society in London in 1866.
Wenham's report, "Aerial Locomotion," was published in the Society's journal and reprinted in widely distributed aeronautical publications in the 1890s, including Octave Chanute's "Progress In Flying Machines". The paper introduced the idea of superposed wings in a flying machine, a concept Wenham tested in 1858 with a multiwing glider, although it did not actually fly. In 1866 he patented the design, which became the basis for biplanes, triplanes and multiplanes that took to the air as gliders in the 1890s, and as airplanes in the early decades of the 20th century. Superposed wings increased the lifting area and avoided the structural problems of excessive wing length. According to some sources John Stringfellow was influenced by Wenham's works or possibly even by his personal communication when creating his steam engine triplane model aircraft which was demonstrated publicly on the international exhibition in the Crystal Palace in 1868.
Wenham first tested superposed wings in 1866 with a model that resembled a Venetian blind. Several variants were attempted with some success, so Wenham decided to build a machine which could support a man. He tested it in the evening in a strong breeze. He was taken by surprise however, when, as he wrote, "A sudden gust caught up the experimenter, who was carried some distance from the ground". A monoplane attempt that same year was inconsequential ("Flying Machines, 1911").
In 1871 Wenham and colleague John Browning designed and constructed what was probably the world's first wind tunnel. Their experiments showed that high aspect ratio wings—long and narrow—had a better lift-to-drag ratio than short stubby wings with the same lifting area. Writing about his work, Wenham may have been the first scientist to use the word "aeroplane".
Aviation writer Carroll Gray says Wenham's work may have been an important influence on the Wright brothers:
It is striking to note that at least four significant aerial vehicle design elements suggested by Wenham in 1866 can be seen on the series of successful Wright gliders and on the 1903 Wright Flyer: 1) superimposed wings, 2) vertical upright supports between the superimposed wings, 3) the prone position of the operator, as in Wenham's design with superimposed wings, and 4) that turning in flight ought be accomplished by means of generating more lift on one side of the aerial vehicle than on the other, rather than through the use of a simple rudder. It is also important to restate that Wenham's paper "Aerial Locomotion" was readily available to Wilbur Wright (as well as to Orville) in the 1895 "Aeronautical Annual" which the Smithsonian Institution recommended to Wilbur Wright in June 1899 (along with other aeronautical reading material), and which he soon thereafter obtained and read.
Aeronautics was Wenham's "spare time" pursuit. In his regular career he designed marine engines, ship's propellers, gas and hot air engines, and high pressure boilers.
Wenham was also highly skilled in the use of microscopes. He published many papers on the subject and designed stands, objective lenses and prisms, fabricating some of the latter himself.

ILNumerics.Net

ILNumerics is a mathematical class library for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) developers. It simplifies the implementation of an array of numerical algorithms. ILNumerics was designed to help developers create distribution-ready applications. Interfaces of existing algebra systems were often found to be less effective, when it comes to distribution/integration into existing projects; therefore, ILNumerics does not come with an interpreter but directly utilizes features of modern development environments and programming languages like C#.
History.
ILNumerics started in 2006 and serves its community with high performance fundamental math classes since. In 2007 ILNumerics won the BASTA! Innovation Awards 2007 as most innovative .NET project in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. After 6 years of open source development, the project added a closed source, proprietary license in 2011, aiming business and academic developers at the same time.
Features.
N-dimensional arrays, complex numbers, linear algebra, FFT and plotting controls (2D and 3D) help developing algorithms on every platform the CLI runs on. Developers formulate computational algorithms directly in their favorite CLI language - avoiding the need for interfacing 3rd party mathematical frameworks. The syntax is vastly compatible to well known and established mathematical programs like MATLAB and GNU Octave. Due to its strong type safety algorithms developed that way are more stable and robust at run time. The library is the only math library so far, which takes the characteristics of the CLI into account and therefore achievers better execution performance than its competitors.
Performance.
Since ILNumerics comes as a CLI assembly, it targets Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) applications. Just like Java - those frameworks are often criticized for not being suitable for numerical computations. Reasons are the memory management by a garbage collector and the intermediate language execution. Nevertheless, due to efficient memory management (pooling), the performance of ILNumerics algorithms beat the speed of many competing frameworks by factors. Linear algebra routines rely on processor specific optimized versions of LAPACK and BLAS, which further increases performance and reliability of computational results. All internal functions are parallelized. The efficiency does even allow the use for 'numbercrunching' applications, which would otherwise only be suitable for Fortran - yet providing much higher implementational convenience.
Alternatives.
Some algebraic systems come with compiler extensions for native code/C code generation. The most famous example here is Matlab's .NET Builder. Some other libraries aim the .NET platform only, namely: dnanalytics, CenterSpace Software's NMath numerical libraries, Visual Numerics' IMSL.

Science-Fiction Plus

Science-Fiction Plus (with a lower-case subtitle: preview of the future) was a science fiction magazine published in 1953 by Gernsback Publications, Inc., Philadelphia 32, Pa. With a large, 8-3/8" x 11-1/4" format, it began as a monthly but switched to bi-monthly with the June 1953 issue.
Edited and published by Hugo Gernsback, the 68-page magazine (the front and back covers were counted as pages) sold for 35¢ and ran for seven issues, from March 1953 (Vol 1 No 1) to December 1953 (Vol 1 No 7). Not intended as a pulp magazine, it began as a slick (printed on quality paper) with glossy covers. However, for the last two issues, Oct and Dec 1953 (Nos 6 and 7), the paper was switched from slick to "book paper". 
Writers and illustrators.
The lineup of writers included Robert Bloch, Philip José Farmer, Murray Leinster, Chad Oliver. Clifford D. Simak and James H. Schmitz. It featured the first published story by Anne McCaffrey. Cover illustrations were by Frank R. Paul and Alex Schomburg, with interior illustrations by Muneef Alwan, Seymour Augenbraun, Paul Cooper, Virgil Finlay, Charles Hornstein, Jay Landau, Tom O'Reilly, Frank R. Paul and others.
The first issue had novelettes by Gernsback, Farmer and Donald Howard Menzel, with short stories by John Scott Campbell, Gernsback (as Greno Gashbuck) and Otto Binder, book reviews by Moskowitz and a variety of essays.
In "Transformations: The Story of the Science Fiction Magazines from 1950 to 1970" (2005), historian Mike Ashley questioned the level of quality in "Science-Fiction Plus" as he outlined the magazine's essential problem:
The final issue (December 1953) featured stories by Corwin F. Stickney, Murray Leinster, Harry Bates, James H. Schmitz, Frank M. Robinson and Eric Frank Russell. Michael Fischer did the cover story, "Misfit," illustrated by Paul.

Then There Were Five

Then There Were Five (1944) is a children's novel by award-winning author Elizabeth Enright. The third of her four books about the Melendy family, it is preceded by "The Saturdays" and "The Four-Story Mistake", and followed by "". "Then There Were Five" takes place in the summer immediately following "The Four-Story Mistake".
Plot introduction.
The four Melendy children live with their father, a widowed professor of economics, and Cuffy, their beloved housekeeper, in an old house in the countryside of New York. Their Father has been hired by the government for a secret, World War II related job, and the children venture into their new neighborhood with the intention of helping their country. They end up making new friends collecting scrap metal, and also brush up against some local scoundrels. The most notable of their new friends is Mark, a boy about Rush's age, who is under the care of his abusive adult cousin Oren Meeker. The Melendy children want to help Mark, but don't know how. 
Meanwhile, there are adventures to be had: Rush composes his Opus 3, Miranda "Randy" and Mona try their hand at canning, and Oliver is entranced by the possibilities presented by fish and caterpillars. But when Cuffy, their housekeeper, goes away to visit a sick cousin in Ithaca, the unexpected occurs. A fire brings Mark to live at The Four-Story Mistake, where he becomes a permanent member of their family.
Reception.
"Then There Were Five" capitalizes on the country setting and young Oliver's fascination with nature. Charisse Gendron writes "Enright expresses the wonder in nature and in children's feelings. This is most remarkable in the chapter "Oliver's Other World" in which the child... is visited one night by a Luna moth". She also praises that fact that the emotional effect of Owen Meeker's death on his young cousin is not ignored. 
The addition of Mark, according to Irene Haas, "adds much to the family and the book." "Kirkus Reviews" says "There is a certain guilelessness about Elizabeth Enright's stories -- but they leave you with a warm and pleasant glow." The "Saturday Review" also liked the addition of Mark and the way he proved his worth to the Melendy's. "Mark's whole relationship to the Melendy family and their final acceptance of him show a fine sense of values... As you finish this story you can almost hear the children say: 'That is a good book!'"

Re-Education (Through Labor)

"Re-Education (Through Labor)" is the first single from Rise Against's fifth studio album, "Appeal to Reason". The single was released digitally to digital stores and radio stations on August 25, 2008. A music video was released on the same day.
A limited physical version of the single was released on 7" vinyl and can be obtained exclusively by pre-ordering "Appeal to Reason". This version also includes a B-side titled "Minor Threat", which is a cover of the eponymous song by Minor Threat.
The single's fifth week on the "Billboard" Alternative Songs chart made "Re-Education (Through Labor)" Rise Against's second-highest charting single to date, hitting number five. It has since reached a peak of number three. The band's previous highest charting single on the Alternative Songs chart was "The Good Left Undone", the third single from the band's previous album, which peaked at number 6. "Re-Education (Through Labor)" is also Rise Against's first song to appear on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.
Appearances.
The song has been used in TV spots for the MyNetworkTV premiere of WWE Friday Night Smackdown. It was also used partially during the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2008.
The song appears in the video game "Guitar Hero World Tour" and is available as DLC for the Rock Band series along with "Savior" and "Prayer of the Refugee".
It also appears in the offroad arcade racing game, Nail'd as a background music track.
The song was used by the NFL in their 2008/2009 end-of-season highlight package, as well as being used by Fox Sports (Australia) in 2009 during coverage of the NRL competition.
"Re-Education (Through Labor)" featured in 2009 horror film Orphan.
The song is used in a video package the Boston Bruins show before each game.
The song also reached #84 Triple J Hottest 100 in 2008.
In 2012, the song was used for the 2012 Korean Grand Prix.
Song meaning.
Frontman Tim McIlrath spoke to MTV News about this song: "It's talking a lot about the 9-to-5, dog-eat-dog lifestyle, and what we are asked to do to simply make ends meet nowadays, and I think it's a feeling shared by people all around the world and especially in this country."
Music video.
The song's music video was directed by Kevin Kerslake (Faith No More, Green Day), filmed in the band's home city of Chicago and features members of the Chicago branch of the Moped Army and their mopeds. McIlrath admitted to MTV News that the promo does have a slightly political theme, which practically anyone will relate to. He explained: "One of the great things about doing a video is that your imagination is the only thing that's limiting you, so you can do anything. So we have a video that's going to encompass the anger and the angst that the youth of America feel toward society at large and the things that are demanded of them."
On September 22, 2008, Rise Against released the music video for "Re-Education (Through Labor)". 
The video begins with a quote from President John F. Kennedy: "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable." It frequently switches between scenes of the band playing in the basement of an abandoned cinema and an army of moped riders. The group drives around Chicago and drops backpacks, presumably bombs, in various locations. The closing scene shows the row of moped riders watching the city burn in the night after the bombs have detonated. This links back to the J.F.K quote about violent rebellion.
There is another version of this video, with informative statistics on subjects such as deforestation, the death of children, and others. This version is called "uncensored", because the original video doesn´t show any of this information.
Award nominations.
"Re-Education (Through Labor)" has been nominated for a 2009 MuchMusic Video Award in the category Best International Video (Group).

B1436 road

The B1436 runs for about through Norfolk, England, from a little southwest of Cromer to Thorpe Market. It is a useful conduit to avoid the busy seaside town of Cromer during the summer months and links the A148 from Kings Lynn to the A140 to Norwich and the A149 to Great Yarmouth.
History.
The route of the B1436 can be seen clearly on Faden’s large-scale map (at one inch to the mile) of the county of Norfolk of 1779, which shows that the most part of this road’s route has changed very little over the years, even after the Parliamentary Enclosure of the early 19th century. The main difference between the ancient thoroughfare and its route today is in the village of Roughton, where it now is dissected by a staggered two-mini-roundabout junction where the road crosses the A140 between Cromer and Norwich. At the time of Faden’s cartography, the main Cromer to Norwich road was part of the B1436 from Roughton Green to this new junction in the centre of the village.
Usage.
Travellers to and from Norwich who use the A140, use the B1436 between Felbrigg and Roughton to avoid the bottleneck one-way system that is in the town of Cromer at the convergence of the A148 from Kings Lynn and the A149 road coast road from Kings Lynn to Great Yarmouth. The B1436 cuts the corner in a northwest-southeast direction, linking the A140 to the A148 and giving easy access to Sheringham and other coastal villages to the west of Cromer. The consequence of this is that this useful route makes the road as busy as the main A roads in the area, especially in high summer.
Sections of interest.
Travelling from northwest to southeast, the road passes through:
On the right after the road passes the entrance to the National Trust property of Felbrigg Hall. After , at Roughton, the road crosses the A140 road between Cromer and Norwich by means of a staggered junction with two mini roundabouts, before proceeding on to its terminus at its junction with the A149 at Thorpe Market after

As of July 2013, he is ranked #6 in the world by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Ovtcharov won the silver medal as part of the German men's team, together with Timo Boll and Christian Süß.
He used a special technique in his serves, which was later picked by TIME as one of the top 50 innovations of 2008.
On September 22, 2010 Ovtcharov had been suspended by the German Table Tennis Federation (DTTB) due to a positive A-sample test for Clenbuterol that may be used as performance-enhancing substance. Ovtcharov himself denied the doping accusation and requested a B-sample analysis which still tested positive. After hearings and further investigations, the hair sample voluntarily offered by Ovtcharov showed no evidence of clenbuterol and its abuse. DTTB later unanimously decided to abolish the suspension on October 15, 2010. The decision was endorsed by ITTF. 
At the 2012 Summer Olympics Ovcharov was part of the German table tennis team and he won bronze medals in singles and team events respectively.

The buildings of the Home School were constructed according to the Cottage System of Institutional Care, which is a design theory used by state hospitals and mental asylums in the late 19th century. The system called for the institutions to be built away from the populous in a rural area to create a private, tranquil atmosphere, with farm operations often becoming an integral part of the property. The original property was gradually expanded so that by 1936 it consisted of of land, which exceeds the current land area.

Negro Mountain

Negro Mountain is a long ridge of the Allegheny Mountains extending from Deep Creek Lake in Maryland, north to the Casselman River in Pennsylvania, United States. The summit, Mount Davis, is the highest point (3,213 feet) in Pennsylvania. Laurel Hill flanks Negro Mountain to the west, with Allegheny Mountain to the east.
Geography and climate.
The mountain is flattish in appearance due to its location on the Allegheny Plateau, so its prominence is of low relief. The mountain retains its elevation above for much of its length, especially in Pennsylvania. The Negro Mountain Tunnel, built for the South Pennsylvania Railroad, is abandoned and was never used. The Mount Davis Natural Area on the Mountain is located within the Forbes State Forest and many trails take hikers throughout this alpine landscape. 
Weather on the mountain is fierce, frost can occur at anytime of the year and winds and ice storms are common. Near the summit in Pennsylvania, the trees are stunted and circular rock formations from frost heave can be readily seen.
History.
Details behind the naming of Negro Mountain are not precisely known and a number of local stories have circulated in the past. The various stories seem to share, however, a couple of elements. One is that of a band of white soldiers or hunters skirmishing with Indians on the mountain during colonial times. The other is the presence with the whites of an African-American companion — variously named "Nemisis" ["sic"] or "Goliath" indicating his great strength or size — who accompanied the whites and died valiantly during the fight. The most popular version of the story takes place during the French and Indian War, in the year 1756, when frontiersman Colonel Thomas Cresap is known to have led a force against Native Americans on the mountain. A member of his force, a black slave or a scout named "Nemisis," was killed in the battle. The mountain was accordingly named "Negro Mountain" in his honor.
Another version of the story has a Captain Andrew Friend on a hunting trip on the mountain with a few companions. The party was attacked by Indians and during the ensuing skirmish, an African-American servant of Friend was gravely wounded and died the following morning on the mountain. Again, the mountain where he died defending the life of his master was named in his honor. 
Yet another version, this time from local family lore, tells of: 
The Cresap version is supported by the fact that Cresap is known to have written an account of such an expedition for Benjamin Franklin's "Pennsylvania Gazette" of June 17, 1756 mentioning that "an old Negro presented his gun at Indians". The "Maryland Gazette" had already described the same expedition on June 10, 1756, mentioning that a "free Negro" had been killed with the English.
Controversy.
In July 2007, Pennsylvania State Representative Rosita C. Youngblood (Democrat of Philadelphia’s 198th District) called for the renaming of Negro Mountain. In a news release, she said, "Through a school project, my son and granddaughter first informed me of the name of this range and I found it to be disparaging that we have one of our great works of nature named as such… I find it disheartening for tourists who visit this range to see the plaque with the name Negro Mountain displayed on the mountainside." 
However, Professor Christopher Bracey, a law professor and associate professor of African and African-American studies at Washington University in St. Louis has said, "I must confess I have a slightly different take on it than … Here we have a mountain, whose name was intended to be a testament to Negro bravery. It seems rather crass and unsophisticated to name it Negro Mountain, but the intentions were strong." 
On 1 August 2007, Youngblood and other lawmakers introduced House Resolution No. 378 resolving that the governor "form a commission …to study the naming of Negro Mountain and Mount Davis …adopt names that accurately reflect the history of the region and the heroism displayed by the African American in the Negro Mountain conflict of 1756" and accordingly to alter "brochures, plaques and signs [to accurately reflect the facts of this heroic historical event". (The 1921 naming of Mount Davis is now also considered controversial because it honors the white settler who once owned the land, rather than the colonial African-American.)
In February 2011, nine Maryland State Senators introduced a bill to rename Negro Mountain and Polish Mountain. All four Western Maryland representatives testified against the proposed bill, which was voted down in committee.

Nobles of the Church (Kingdom of Hungary)

The "nobles of the Church" (; ) were a group of privileged people in the Kingdom of Hungary who possessed lands on the domains of wealthier prelates and were obliged to provide military and other services to their lords.
The first references to peoples who lived on the domains of some prelates of the Kingdom of Hungary and served as horsemen in the prelates' retinue were documented already in the 11th century. By the 13th century, the retinue of several prelates consisted mainly or partly of people who were obliged to provide military service to them in exchange for the possessions they had been granted.
In the beginning, most of the soldiers in the prelates' retinues were serfs who served their lords not only as horsemen but who were employed also in their household. Several freemen joined voluntarily to the prelates' army and offered their possessions to them in order to enjoy the protection of the Church. In the first decades of the 13th century, the kings of Hungary granted the higher legal status of "horsmen serf" (, ) to people serving in the household of the prelates or authorized royal servants to join to the prelates' household. From 1250, the prelates themselves received their serfs into their retinue and thus granted them a higher status in their household. 
In the 11-15th century, the "nobles of the Church" not only provided military services to their lords, but they were obliged to provide some other services ("e.g.", they had to deliver stone, wine or reed to the prelates' household). The "nobles of the Church" endeavoured to acquire all the liberties of the "true nobles of the realm", but the prelates, supported by the kings, managed to reserve their authority over them. Nevertheless, the "nobles of the Church" became exempted from taxes payable to the kings in 1439 and they received exemption also from the tithe in 1500. In 1567, the Diet declared that the size of their weregeld and the value of their oath equaled to those of the "true nobles of the realm".
The "nobles of the Church", in contrast to the "real nobles of the realm", fell under the jurisdiction of the prelates, but they organized their own bodies of self-government called seats. Their "seats" were presided over by the prelate or his deputy and consisted of officers elected by them; they could appeal against the decisions of their "seats" to the royal courts.

History.
Miss Universo Italia was created in 2005. Basically, before Miss Universo Italia, Miss Italia pageant winner will compete at the Miss Universe. Unfortunately, it stopped in 2004. Maria Teresa Francville had already won the right to represent Italy that year by virtue of winning The Miss for Miss Universe, the pageant that selected the Italian delegate to Miss Universe between 2000 and 2004; when that pageant lost the franchise and was discontinued, she entered the newly created Miss Universo Italia competition and won again. The most notable winner of the Miss Universo Italia pageant is Claudia Ferraris, who finished 9th at Miss Universe 2008. Before her, the last Italian delegate to advance to the Miss Universe semifinals was Denny Mendez in 1997, marking a gap of 11 years for Italy between the last two placements.

Personal Offshoring or Smallsourcing is a business model where individual consumers or small businesses (often sole proprietorships) directly outsource their work. It is a form of Offshoring. According to the Wall Street Journal, "he approach relies on the same model that drives corporate outsourcing: labor arbitrage, or benefiting from the wage differential between U.S. workers and those in developing countries." It can potentially be a dangerous business model if not managed appropriately. Problems can include language barriers and communications issues due to differences in time zones.

Intimacy (Bloc Party album)

Intimacy is the third studio album by British indie rock band Bloc Party. It was recorded in two weeks at several locations in London and Kent during 2008 and was produced by Paul Epworth and Jacknife Lee. Inspired by the release options available in the Internet age, the band members made the album available for purchase on their website as a digital download on 21 August 2008. Minimal promotion was undertaken in the UK. The record was released in compact disc form on 24 October 2008, with Wichita Recordings as the primary label. It peaked at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart and entered the "Billboard" 200 in the United States at number 18.
Bloc Party wanted to create an album that further distanced the band from the traditional rock set-up by incorporating more electronic elements and unconventional musical arrangements. As the record's title suggests, its tracks are about personal relationships and are loosely based on one of frontman Kele Okereke's break-ups in 2007. Three songs were released as singles: "Mercury", "Talons", and "One Month Off"; the first two tracks entered the UK Top 40. "Intimacy" was generally well received by critics. Reviewers often focused on its rush-release and central theme, and considered them either bold steps or poor choices.
Origins and recording.
Bloc Party's second album "A Weekend in the City", released in 2007, allowed the quartet to evolve sonically by including more electronically tampered soundscapes, but the band members were not entirely comfortable with more daring musical arrangements when making the record. According to multi-instrumentalist Gordon Moakes, the impromptu November 2007 single "Flux" "opened a door to the fact that we could go in any direction" in future works. After the "NME" Big Gig in February 2008, the band members took a month off from touring and did not interact with each other during that period. Moakes felt that there were no rules when the band re-assembled for studio work. Chief lyricist Okereke completed most of the songwriting before the recording process.
In mid-2008, Bloc Party attended secret sessions at studios in the south-east of England. The band aimed to use a similar process to the creation of "Flux", which was crafted in a week. Paul Epworth and Jacknife Lee—from Bloc Party's previous albums, "Silent Alarm" and "A Weekend in the City", respectively—returned to the production staff for "Intimacy", because the band members felt that they had "unfinished business" with both. Okereke has stated that having two producers allowed for musical experimentation. Epworth focused on capturing the dynamic of a live band by working on fully developed songs and emphasising the rhythm section in the mix. Lee aided the band members' evolution towards a more electronic style by creating tracks with them. Each producer worked on five of the record's original ten tracks.
According to Okereke, Bloc Party wanted to make something as stylised as R&B or electronica, combining the rawness of "Silent Alarm" and the recording experience gained from "A Weekend in the City". The frontman drew inspiration from Siouxsie and the Banshees' 1988 song "Peek-a-Boo" and aimed to create "rock interpretations of The band worked by initially performing sound checks with only guitar chords, keyboard notes, and drum beats. Discussing the interplay between rhythm guitarist Okereke and lead guitarist Russell Lissack, Epworth has stated that "Kele will do one thing that creates a great deal of impact, whereas Russell's very good at subtle embellishments and leading the melodic side of things outside of the vocal". The band members decided to record the first ten tracks crafted after judging first ideas to often be the best. They "thrived" under the pressure of timed sessions, which lasted only two weeks.
Moakes has indicated that there was no worry about whether a song could be recreated live in concert in the same way as it would appear on record. A brass section and a chamber choir were hired as additional musicians. Drum machines and distorted guitars were used more extensively than in Bloc Party's previous works to create a sense of manipulation to the basic rock palette. Drummer Matt Tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums, as opposed to using his physical output, but agreed to the idea when the band recorded some of the tracks in their entirety. On some songs, the guitars were disregarded and the band focused solely on the beat. Okereke's voice was often used as an instrument by being looped, vocoded, or run through effects pedals.
Promotion and release.
After the studio sessions, Bloc Party embarked on a tour of North American and European summer festivals. One of the recorded tracks, "Mercury", was released as a single on 11 August 2008 and peaked at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. At the time, the band confirmed the existence of further material, but noted that a record release date was scheduled for the end of 2008 at the earliest. Bloc Party unexpectedly announced the completion of "Intimacy" on 18 August 2008 via a webcast and confirmed a release within 60 hours. The band members wanted to revive the importance of a new album's release in an era in which the excitement has dissipated because of extensive Internet coverage. They were inspired by Radiohead's marketing of "In Rainbows" in 2007, but did not consider a "free" sale option. Little press was undertaken in the UK to promote the record because of Okereke's reluctance to discuss personal aspects of his life.
"Intimacy" was made available for download on Bloc Party's website on 21 August 2008. Ten MP3 tracks were sold with a plain black JPEG cover for £5, and a £10 option for the online songs and the future expanded CD was also available. The album title was picked as a "double bluff" with regard to people's expectations; Okereke has explained, "You'd think of wet balladeering. You don't think it's gonna be ugly or harsh. But that's what relationships are really like. It's not just about good times." The release was called "rushed" by publications such as "Billboard" and "The Independent". Tong disagreed with the label and stated that Bloc Party wanted to make a statement that was surprising to anyone interested in their work.
The band showcased tracks from "Intimacy" at Reading Festival at the end of August 2008 and embarked on a North American tour during September. UK appearances on the MTV2 Gonzo Tour and the release of the second single, "Talons", preceded the physical release of the album in October, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight. In the U.S, the record sold 24,000 copies during the first week of release and debuted at number 18 on the "Billboard" 200. Comprehensive sales figures have not been published because the digital download data has not been publicly reported by Bloc Party. The chosen cover art is a stylised shot of a couple kissing, taken by freelance photographer Perry Curties. It was ranked at number 23 on Gigwise's list of The Best Album Covers of 2008, in which the publication called it "intimate and rather ambiguous".
Content.
Lyrics.
The lyrics of "Intimacy" were inspired by a relationship break-up Okereke went through at the end of 2007. The lyricist told "Rolling Stone", "I wouldn't want anyone to think it's the clichéd break-up record but I haven't written about true, personal experiences all that much in the past." The move to more intimate subject matter was "semi-conscious" because the band members did not want to focus on socio-political issues as they had in their previous works. Three tracks allude to Greek mythology: "Ares" draws its name from the god of war, "Trojan Horse" is named after the Trojan War military ruse, and "Zephyrus" draws its name from the god of the west wind. The narrative in the songs occurs between two people and focuses on the relations between lovers, friends, and enemies; Okereke indicated that "it's about moments of shared vulnerability". "Better Than Heaven" references the Garden of Eden and Corinthians (15:22), because the lyricist wanted to explore the themes of sex and death, especially in a biblical context.
"Biko" means "Please" (or more accurately "I implore you") in Igbo—a language spoken in Nigeria, the homeland of Okereke's parents—and is used "when you're beseeching someone to do something". Okereke denied that it is about the murdered South African anti-apartheid protester Steve Biko. The lyrics of "One Month Off" reference feelings of anger and are about being in love with someone younger and unfaithful, while "Zephyrus" concerns an apology following neglect. The lyrics in the chorus of "Ion Square", the last track on the original download release, are based on E. E. Cummings' poem "I Carry Your Heart with Me". Okereke considers the song a personal favourite because it evokes the initial exciting stages of a new relationship when everything is going right.
Composition.
Okereke has discussed a natural progression in Bloc Party's compositional style to a more explorative, electronic direction. For the opening track on "Intimacy", "Ares", the frontman was inspired to rap his lyrics after listening to the old school hip hop of Afrika Bambataa. According to Heather Phares of Allmusic, the song includes siren-like guitar chords and loud, complex drumming in the vein of dance acts The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. "Mercury" continues the complex drumming theme by incorporating layered percussion and contains a vocally manipulated chorus. The track is an attempt at drum and bass and features brass dissonance, effects Okereke has called "harsh, glacial, layered and energetic". "Zephyrus" begins with a solitary vocal line accompanied only by a drum machine pattern, while the Exmoor Singers provide background vocals in the rest of the composition. "Signs" is the only song that does not include guitars; instead, it is made up of a synthesiser pulse and multitracked samples of glockenspiel and mbira resembling the work of minimalist composer Steve Reich.
Okereke has conceded that "Intimacy" covers Bloc Party's typical indie rock elements, but noted that the guitars have an artificial and manipulated sound, "almost like all the humanity has been bleached out". "Halo" has a fast tempo coupled with a guitar melody that uses only four chords, while "Trojan Horse" features syncopated guitars and distortion. "Talons" also incorporates distortion from both lead and rhythm guitars, while the final single "One Month Off" consists of tribal rhythms and sixteenth note guitar riffs. "Biko" has a slower tempo and includes guitar arpeggi throughout, while "Ion Square" incorporates guitar overdubbing and the use of hi-hat patterns throughout. According to Nick Southall of Drowned in Sound, "Better Than Heaven" encapsulates what Bloc Party had been trying to achieve in their previous works, "namely aligning all their different directional desires: to swoon, to rock, and to experiment all at once". The track features broken beats and layered vocals.
Critical reception.
Media response to "Intimacy" was generally favourable; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 69% based on 27 critical reviews. Steven Robertshaw of "Alternative Press" described the album as arguably Bloc Party's finest career moment and noted that it offers "sweat and circuitry, savagery and submission, and a captivating energy that's severely lacking in many music scenes on the planet". Kyle Anderson of "Rolling Stone" claimed that by "replacing Bloc Party's distant cool with vivid honesty, Okereke makes "Intimacy" a confident new peak for his band", while PopMatters' Ross Langager explained that the record "might not actually be all that intimate, but it is a thing of rough, recycled beauty". Adam Mazmanian of "The Washington Times" commented that the album's final mix showed that producers Epworth and Lee preserved the essence of Bloc Party's signature sound—"minor key rock thrumming with rhythmic intensity"—while taking the band in new musical directions. Dave Simpson of "The Guardian" concluded that it would please old and new fans alike by being "brave, individual and heartfelt".
Pitchfork Media's Ian Cohen was less receptive and asserted that the record seems like a document of a band disconnected from its musical strengths. Josh Modell of "Spin" felt that "Intimacy" sometimes gets "sonically or lyrically precarious", while John Robinson of "Uncut" commented that "there's an air of slightly hedged bets". Drowned in Sound's Nick Southall claimed that the record is not quite the radical statement Bloc Party set out to achieve, but concluded that it is "definitely a little bit of invigorating redemption at a time when doubts were beginning to cloud what was, initially, a flawless reputation". In its year-end music review for 2008, "Under the Radar" stated about the band members, "They are so solid and so confident that it seems inevitable that they will get many chances to slowly drift into more daring lands. But without more risk, they may be destined to make albums like "Intimacy" – accomplished and intriguing, but not life changing, not classic." The record figured in several publications' end-of-year best album lists for 2008—notably, at number 14 by Gigwise, at number 36 by Drowned in Sound, and at number 49 by "NME".

The Tuvalu Trust Fund is an international sovereign wealth fund established to benefit Tuvalu, a small, central Pacific island nation, by providing income to cover shortfalls in the national budget. The Tuvalu Trust Fund was established in 1987 by the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.” The value of the Tuvalu Trust Fund, as at 30 September 2012, was approximately A$127.3m, with the market value of the fund increasing by 10.5% during the 2011/2012 financial year.
Australia and New Zealand continue to contribute capital to the Tuvalu Trust Fund and provide other forms of development assistance.
History.
An agreement to establish the trust fund was signed in Suva on 16 June 1987 by representatives of the governments of Tuvalu, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The initial amount invested by the latter three nations amounted to A$27.1 million. The United Kingdom withdrew from the agreement in 2004.
Through successful investment abroad, the initial assets of A$27 million grew to A$66 million in 2000 and A$100 million in 2010. This amount was achieved with the help of other international donors of Japan and South Korea. The 20th anniversary review of the Tuvalu Trust Fund described the performance as being that:
Contribution to the Tuvaluan budget.
The Fund was established for the intended purpose of helping to supplement national deficits, underpin economic development, and help the nation achieve greater financial autonomy. An undertaking of the Government of Tuvalu is that it will “treat all moneys received by it from the Fund as public moneys of Tuvalu and as such subject to Parliamentary appropriation and scrutiny.”
The Trust Fund, has contributed roughly (A$79 million) 15% of the annual government budget each year since 1990. With a capital value of about 2.5 times GDP, the Trust Fund provides an important cushion for Tuvalu's volatile income sources from fishing and royalties from the sale of the .tv domain. Meeting the needs of the 2013/14 budget of the Tuvaluan Government will require drawing from funds held in the “B Account”.
Structure.
Brian Bell, a member of the Tuvalu Trust Fund Advisory Committee since the inception of the Fund in 1987, describes the purpose of the Fund as being:
Brian Bell described the operation of the Fund as being directed to ensuring that the capital of the Fund is maintained in real terms for inflation, with payments to the Tuvalu Government each year:
The capital of the Fund is known as the “A Account”. The "B Account" or “Consolidated Investment Fund” (CIF) is a revolving “buffer account” that receives funds from the returns or “disbursements” of the "A Account". The operation of the Fund through two accounts assists in stabilizing the long-term financial situation of the Government of Tuvalu as well as addressing short-term budget needs. The "B Account", which belongs exclusively to the Government, holds income distributions from the "A Account" until funds are needed to be used for the national budget. It therefore serves as a buffer against the volatility of the ‘A Account’ returns, i.e., during years when there are no returns or low returns. For example:
The role of the "B Account" is therefore to improve the predictability and consistency of transfers from the "A Account". The "B Account" must maintain a sufficient balance to cover the years in which there are no returns or low returns from the "A Account". There is no specific language in the agreement that established the Fund as to the minimum balance of the "B Account". There has been a debate about how much of a buffer is sufficient.
The Fund was established with a management structure that was designed to avoid the mismanagement and corruption that has plagued many other Pacific trust funds. One important element of the Fund is that it is structured to avoid overdrawing to fund unauthorised projects. This is achieved through the "separation of fund capital from fund proceeds available for distribution." The success of the Fund is attributed by Brian Bell to the following factors:
• Accountability through a Board of four directors with Tuvalu in the chair and the other original parties providing members;
• Professional funds management;
• Monitoring of the fund performance by actuarial consultants (the Fund Monitor);
• Auditing of the fund by international auditors;
• An advisory committee to monitor Tuvalu’s economic performance and provide advice to the Government and the Board.
Falekaupule Trust Fund (FTF).
The success of the Tuvalu Trust Fund was followed by the establishment of the Falekaupule Trust Fund (FTF), which is a trust fund for outer island development. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided A$6 million in loan funds, with the FTF being established in July 1999 and with the funds being invested in February 2000. The Tuvalu Government agreed to match the amount provided by the ADB, with contributions from each of the eight island communities of Tuvalu, and with the contributions from the island contributions also matched by the Government. The governance structure of the FTF follows that of the Tuvalu Trust Fund, but each with island community having a representative on the board and the government provides a non-voting chair. In 2001 the value of the FTF was around $15 million of which $1.2 million was contributed by the island communities. The market value of the FTF has increased:
The global financial crisis affected the FTF, which is required maintained its value in real terms before a distribution can be made. At 30 September 2010, the maintained value was $27.3 million; the result of capital growth and contributions from development partners. This is some $3.5 million higher than the market value of $23.8 million. The gap of 15% between the market value and the maintained value must be recouped before another distribution can be made. Since the commencement of FTF the there have been only four years in which distributions were made. The FTF has distributed $6.4 million with some $5.3 million allocated to island development (the balance of $1.1 million is held in reserve by the communities). This equates to an average of $55,000 spent per island per year.

Service as an Air Force ship.
"Coastal Sentry" was acquired by the U.S. Air Force and was used as a missile range instrumentation ship which operated as USAFS "Coastal Sentry" on the U.S. Air Force's Eastern Test Range during the late 1950s and early 1960s. "Coastal Sentry" operated under an Air Force contract with Pan American Airways Guided Missile Range Division headquartered in Cocoa Beach, Florida.
"Coastal Sentry" was assigned to the South Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean area, and provided the Air Force with metric data on intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida.
"Coastal Sentry" operated in the intercontinental ballistic missile re-entry area near Ascension Island, and was home-ported out of Recife, Brazil.
Acquisition by the Navy.
"Coastal Sentry" was acquired from the U.S. Air Force by the U.S. Navy in 1964 which placed her out of service in 1972. Operational data while on U.S. Navy service on this vessel is lacking.

A400 road (Great Britain)

The A400 road is an A road in London that runs from Charing Cross (near Trafalgar Square, in London's West End) to Archway in North London. As it does so, it includes a number of Central London's most famous streets and passes some of its most famous landmarks.
Starting at Charing Cross, it starts off as the Charing Cross Road, passing over Cambridge Circus before becoming the northern part of Shaftesbury Avenue, Bloomsbury Street and Gower Street in one direction, and Tottenham Court Road in the other. Passing over the Euston Road, it becomes the Hampstead Road (so-called because it was traditionally the road to Hampstead from London), then Camden High Street in one direction, and Camden Street in the other, as it passes through Camden Town and over the Regent's Canal, and then becomes Kentish Town Road as it passes through Kentish Town, and Fortess Road, on its way to Tufnell Park. From Tufnell Park, it then becomes Junction Road until it terminates at Archway. 
Places of interest on the route of the A400 include Trafalgar Square, the National Portrait Gallery, Leicester Square, Foyles, Denmark Street, the Garrick Theatre, Phoenix Theatre, Palace Theatre, Dominion Theatre, Shaftesbury Theatre, and Central YMCA Club, University College London, the British Museum, and the Senate House, Koko (formerly the Camden Palace), and the former TV-AM "Breakfast Television Centre" (now in use by MTV) at Hawley Crescent. 
There are several other buildings of architectural interest along the route of the A400. In the West End, the brutalist Centre Point is one of the original 1960s set of skyscrapers in London. The International style glass-clad Euston Tower dominates the skyline at Euston. The cylindrical BT Tower, a former Cold-War-era microwave relay tower that was once the tallest building in London and the hub of the British Telecom microwave network, is a short distance off the A400 at Malet Street. As it passes through Camden Town, it passes the Art Deco Carreras Cigarette Factory. At the northern end of the A400, there is the architecturally controversial brutalist Archway Tower.
The Charing Cross and Barnet branches of the Northern Line together follow almost the same route as the A400, and many of their stations are located on it. The following London Underground stations can be found on the A400: Charing Cross tube station, Leicester Square tube station, Tottenham Court Road tube station, Goodge Street tube station, Warren Street tube station, the famous Mornington Crescent tube station, Camden Town tube station, Kentish Town tube station, Tufnell Park tube station, and Archway tube station.

Indilinx

Indilinx, Inc. was a formerly South Korean-based solid-state drive (SSD) controller manufacturer with business headquarters in San Jose, California. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of the OCZ Technology Group until the latter sold its assets including Indilinx to Toshiba in OCZ's bankruptcy sale, and was fully integrated into the newly-founded OCZ Storage Solutions division of Toshiba.
Indilinx's main product, was their Barefoot flash controller hardware and software for solid state drives, which is used by SSD manufacturers.
History.
Indilinx was established on October 19, 2006 by Bumsoo Kim, Guiyoung Lee, and Hyunmo Chung. Their first office was in Bundang, South Korea. In December 2006 Indilinx was certified as a venture company by the KIBO Technology Fund. In February 2007 they moved to their advanced technology research center in Seongnam, South Korea.
The Indilinx Barefoot is an ARM-based SATA controller used in high performance SSDs. 
Drives based on this controller were approximately competitive with the Intel X25-M, while boasting generally lower prices and greater retail availability. TRIM support is available for almost all drives, with appropriate firmware released by respective drive manufacturers. Performance, cost, and features were broadly similar across all product lines that were tested in 2009 by Anandtech, with most differences coming down to the speed of the flash memory devices instead of the controllers.
A rate of 230 MB/s was announced in August 2008, with availability in the fourth quarter of 2008.
In March 2011, OCZ acquired Indilinx Co., Ltd. OCZ intellectual property including approximately 20 patents and patent applications, for approximately $32 million of OCZ common stock. Indilinx continued to produce and supply its line of controller products. The Indilinx controller business, and its 45 employees, remained under Bumsoo Kim, the founder and president of Indilinx, and Hyunmo Chung, Indilinx's chief technology officer.
With the SATA 2.0 data transfer protocol increasingly proving to be the bottleneck for SSD performance, Indilinx released the Everest series controller supporting the SATA revision 3.0 protocol in July 2011.
Drives from the following product lines contain an Indilinx controller:

In 1927, she stayed at Lund University with the folklore professor Carl Wilhelm von Sydow. In 1934, she obtained the Dr. Phil. degree in folkloristics as the first woman in Denmark. From 1932 to her death, she was archivist at the Danish Folklore archive ("Dansk Folkemindesamling"). However, during many years, she had to occasionally take temporary jobs as a school teacher in order to provide a living for herself. Not until 1952, when she had a long-established name in international folkloristics, she obtained a steady position.
In 1945, she received the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat. The prize enabled her to embark on a study trip to the U.S.A, where she worked with Stith Thompson and co-edited his "Motif-Index of Folk-Literature".

Bigg Boss 1

Bigg Boss in 2006 was the first season of the Indian reality TV programme "Bigg Boss". It aired on Sony Entertainment Television from 3 November 2006 to 26 January 2007, a total of 86 days. Unlike other versions of "Big Brother", the Indian version uses celebrities as housemates, not members of the general public.
The show is based on the original Dutch "Big Brother" format developed by John de Mol. A number of contestants (known as "housemates") lived in a purpose-built house and were isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, housemates nominated two of their peers for eviction, and the housemates who received the most nominations would face a public vote. Of these, one would eventually leave, having been "evicted" from the House. However, there were exceptions to this process as dictated by Bigg Boss. In the final week, there were three housemates remaining, and the public voted for who they wanted to win. 
Tasks were set by Bigg Boss each week. The housemates were allowed to gamble on task outcomes, and were rewarded with extra money to order more supplies if they won.

The Troubadour, London

The Troubadour at 263–267 Old Brompton Road in Earls Court, established in 1954, is one of the last remaining coffee houses of its era in London, with a club room in the cellar famous as one of the primary venues of the British folk revival in the late 1950s and 1960s. The club was one of several London coffee house venues at which notable musicians played; other such venues included Les Cousins and Bunjies.
Artists.
The club has played host to a number of major artists in various stages of their careers. Notable among these have been:
The club is, however, chiefly associated with folk music. Notable artists appearing under this banner have been:
Many of these acts are captured performing at the venue in the photographs of Alison Chapman McLean.
Behind the scenes.
A key name in the history of the Troubadour is that of Anthea Joseph (1940–1997) who organised many of the folk events at the club and was often credited as 'the Manager' of the venue. It is widely reported that when Bob Dylan arrived in London for the first time he was given no instruction other than that of his mentor Pete Seeger to seek out "Anthea at the Troubadour". In 1968 she joined Witchseason Productions as Joe Boyd's assistant.
Influence.
The Troubadour's influence was felt around the UK. The Bristol Troubadour Club fulfilled a similar role in the west of England, but with a more bluesy feel. 
The Troubadour in Los Angeles was a copy of the London club (it even copied the sign above the door) that opened in 1957 and runs still today. From the beginning it was a much larger venue but with a similar ethos.
Ownership.
The Troubadour has had only three sets of proprietors since its opening:
Recent history.
The Troubadour is now a thriving cafe-bar and restaurant and the club continues to host live music and poetry, mainly by performers who, in the club's tradition, write their own material; more recent artists to pass through the club include Jamie T, Jack Peñate, The Dead 60s, Chris Singleton, Paulo Nutini and Morcheeba. The performance space has been doubled in size but is still an intimate venue of just 120 seats. Upstairs, the café itself also continues to thrive.

Local college and university (Philippines)

Local colleges and universities (LCUs) are higher educational institutions that are being run by local government units in the Philippines.
A local government unit (LGU) maybe a barangay, a municipality, city, or a province that puts up a post-secondary institution based on Section 447(a)(5)(x) (Municipality), 458(a)(5)(x) (City), and 468(a)(4)(iii) (Province) of the Local Government Code of 1991, which provide that
"subject to availability of funds and to existing laws, rules and regulations the" LGU "shall establish and provide for the operation of vocational and technological schools and similar post-secondary institutions and, with approval of the Department of Education, fix and collect reasonable fees and other school charges at said institutions, subject to existing laws on tuition fees." 
With this law, a large portion of the functions of the national government such as public works, social welfare, health services, and education was transferred to the local government.
LCUs operate on the premise that the territorial boundary of the LGU, with all the education infrastructure and facilities built by the province, city, or municipality, is the university campus itself. It means that an LCU has free access to all the structures found in the LGU, including its library, sports complex, hospitals, business establishments, and barangay centers.
History.
The forerunner of local colleges and universities or LCUs are the community schools which usually function as elementary or secondary schools at daytime and, toward the end of the day, convert into a community college. This type of educational institution were limited to the old Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) infrastructure, while LCUs are of recent origin.
In 1965, the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, the first institution of higher learning in the Philippines to be fully subsidized by a local government unit, was established through the "Republic Act 4196", which authorizes the City of Manila to operate its own university. For more than two decades, the PLM was the only local university in the country until the creation of other local universities and colleges through the enactment and implementation of the "Republic Act 7160", also known as the "Local Government Code of 1991," and the "Republic Act 7796", or the "Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994".
With an increased share of taxes from 11% to 40% given by the national government units plus their own income as highly urbanized cities or municipalities, a good number of LGUs decided to put up their own LCUs. LGUs are aware that while it is easy even for poor families to send their children to elementary and high school because costs are relatively lower, sending them to college poses a big problem. It is in this light that local government units are inspired to establish and maintain institutions of higher learning (HEIs) in their own localities.
Through an LCU, high school graduates from poor families can earn a three- to six-month course certificate, two-year Associate degree, or a four-year Baccalaureate degree paying only minimal, if any, tuition fee. This is exemplified by the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig, and the University of Makati, which have successfully graduated deserving students from low-income families.
Naming.
To create a standard and distinction between a "community college" and a "local college and university" and to have better planning purposes and more fair distribution of technical and financial assistance by the national government, the Association of Local Colleges and Universities, and the director and staff of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Office of Programs and Standards visited all the "community colleges" that were included in the CHED statistics.

Jaime Giménez Arbe

Jaime Giménez Arbe (also spelt "Jiménez" by the press, though the correct spelling is "Giménez", as he wrote it in a letter signed by himself and showed to the journalists' cameras by his lawyer Mariano Trillo-Figueroa) (Madrid, 12 January 1956) is the identity behind the Spanish anarchist and bank robber known as "El Solitario" ("The Loner").
He is charged with more than thirty armed robberies, in banks all over Spain, as well as with the murder of two Civil Guards in Castejón (Navarra). In addition, in Vall de Uxó (Castellón), during a shooting with "El Solitario", one policeman died due to a stray bullet from another policeman.
He was in prison in the United Kingdom because of drug trafficking, and eight minor trials in Spain had yet to take place. He speaks Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese.
Jaime Giménez Arbe’s detention.
He was arrested in 23 July 2007, in Figueira da Foz (Portugal) as part of the Operation Gloria. A large number of police officers, both Spanish (National Police Officer and Civil Guards from the Central Operational Unit) and Portuguese (Judiciary Police) were there to arrest him while he was, presumably, about to rob the “Caixa Agrícola” Bank, located in Saraiva de Carvalho Street, near the market and the famous Figueira Casino. He was imputed with the murder of two Civil Guards, who he shoot after they asked him to identify himself.
When he was arrested, he was disguised with false beard, mustache and wig and, as always, he wore his bulletproof vest and carried three guns: two short ones and an automatic one. The unprecedented police presence in charge of his search ended a decade of crimes that made him one of the most wanted criminals in Spanish criminal history. In his usual dwelling, and also in a warehouse of his own, large amounts of guns and ammunition were found, as well as disguising props.
He was taken to Coimbra, where he was to make a statement before a judge. At the court door, before the many curious people and the media, he shouted "Hola a todos, soy El Solitario. ¡Salud españoles!" ("Hi, everyone. I’m The Loner. Here’s to you, Spain.") .
Stay in prison.
On 27 July he started a hunger strike as a protest for being moved to a high security level prison. He stopped the protest two days later. .
According to his lawyers Portuguese Elisa Maia and Spanish José Mariano Trillo-Figueroa, the alleged criminal admits being a robber, but denies having murdered the three people of whose deaths he is accused of, claiming that the former Civil Guard General Enrique Rodríguez Galinda, and the former Extremadura Junta President Juan Carlos Rodríguez Ibarra were involved in them. In addition, he admits that the robberies were indeed his, saying that he “robbed banks in order to liberate the Spanish from the bank’s thefts” ».
Trial.
During the trial, that took place in July 2008, Jaime Giménez Arbe pleaded not guilty to the charge of two Civil Guards murders, as well as declaring himself antisystem, anarchist and define his robberies as “bank expropriation”. He also confessed having started his criminal career with Corsican anti-capitalist groups, with which he committed his first robbery. Those sworn statements are similar to the ones in the letter he wrote for the “public opinion” while his stay in Zuera’s prison.
In the trial, which took place in the Navarra Provincial High Court until 29 April 2008, he was found guilty of the two police officers murder in 2004, and was sentenced to 47 years imprisonment.

Cura Ocllo

Cura Ocllo (died 1539) was the wife and sister of Manco Inca Yupanqui, puppet and later remnant ruler of the Inca Empire from 1533 until his death in 1544. Her husband was named Sapa Inca in October 1533 after the death of their common brother Túpac Huallpa, who in his turn had succeeded Atahualpa upon his execution by the Spaniards three months earlier.
Manco initially worked as a puppet ruler from the Cuzco branch of the Inca royal family of Huayna Capac, having challenged Atahualpa and the northern tribes from Quito in the Inca Civil War. He later turned against his Spanish lords and made rebellion, was captured in a failed escape attempt but later released. Once free, Manco started ingenious to free his land from the Spaniards. Attempting to regain the Inca capital of Cuzco in a ten-month siege in 1536, he failed, however, and had though victory over conquistador Francisco Pizarro's brother Hernando at Ollantaytambo in January 1537, had to withdraw.
Cura Ocllo likely followed her husband through these events and bore his son Sayri Tupac in 1535, during Manco's time in captivity. Guerilla war ensued as soon the Spaniards had solved their internal disputes, capturing Cura Ocllo in 1539. She endured gruesome torture and was repeatedly raped by her captors, before being executed, allegedly being pierced by the lances of the Spanish Cañari auxiliaries. According to legend, Her body was put in a basket, per her request, and carried by river to her brother/husband, in the Vilcabamba mountains. Manco followed her in 1544 and became the last symbol and leader of major Inca resistance towards the Spanish conquerors.

Ministry of Housing and Construction

The Ministry of Housing and Construction (, "Misrad HaBinui VeHaShikhun") is a portfolio in the Israeli cabinet. The ministry was created in 1961, and until 1977 it was known as the Ministry of Housing. Construction was also previously part of the Labour and Construction ministry during the provisional government between 1948 and 1949. The current minister is Uri Ariel of the Jewish Home.
There has been a Deputy Minister on several occasions.
Since 1967, the Ministry of Housing (as it was known then) assumed a political importance in the context of Israel's relations with the Palestinians, since this ministry is responsible for construction projects at Israeli settlements on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. The political identity of the minister currently in charge, and ministerial decisions on such construction, could impact the overall government policy.

Bernhard IV, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg

Bernhard IV, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg (died 28 June 1354) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg.
He was the eldest son of Bernhard III, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, by his first wife Agnes, daughter of Rudolf I, Elector of Saxony.
Life.
After the death of his father in 1348, Bernhard inherited the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg as sole ruler, bypassing the rights of his younger brothers Henry and Otto. He also used the title of "Margrave of Landsberg" despite the fact the margraviate had been repurchased by the House of Wettin in 1347.
Bernhard was betrothed shortly before his death to Beatrix (born Wartburg, 1 September 1339 – d. Seusslitz, 25 July 1399), daughter of Frederick II, Margrave of Meissen. The marriage apparently never took place or, if it ever did take place, was only juridical and unconsumated.
Bernhard died without issue and was succeeded by his brother Henry. Shortly after, Beatrix of Meissen took the veil and later became Abbess of Seusslitz near Weissenfels.

RR (film)

RR (aka "Railroad") is a 2008 film by American, James Benning. Shot in 16 mm film, as most of Benning's films are, "RR" is another in Benning's series of American experimental landscape films; this one focusing on trains and their surrounding environs. In "Railroad", Benning explores themes of American consumerism and overconsumption in what Benning calls a "collaboration" with the trains themselves.
The film is an exercise in minimalist restraint. Basically it is a series of static shots of trains. There is an empty frame, the train enters, then it passes and leaves. In other words, it is "porno" for rail fans and trainspotters (often referred to as "foamers," implying they foam at the mouth at the mere sight of a train). The obsessive gaze of Benning's fixed static frame causes the viewer to wait and watch, obsessing like train fanatic Benning does, on the imagery of the locomotive and the exploration of the random colors of its cars, the machinery and the various American landscapes the trains are surrounded by.

Center for Animal Care and Control

Animal Care & Control of New York City (AC&C), formerly known as "The Center for Animal Care and Control (CACC)", is the operator of New York City's municipal shelter system. It is registered as a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization but receives the majority of its income as grants from New York City Department of Health, and less so, other governmental entities of New York City. Its other main source of income is the contract for operating the municipal shelter system on behalf of NYCDOH. It also receives donations from the public. It has a seven-member board of directors, which includes as ex officio members the Commissioner of DOH, the Commissioner of New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and the Deputy Commissioner for Community Affairs at the New
York City Police Department (NYPD). The four remaining members of the Board are appointed by the
Mayor. AC&C was created in 1995 by the City of New York to take over the municipal shelter system from the ASPCA. AC&C is a kill shelter, although their euthanasia rates have been slowly decreasing since 2004. AC&C adoption center facilities operate in only three boroughs.
Criticisms.
There are several major issues surrounding the operation of these facilities. 
First, the ACC is severely underfunded. The City of New York provides less than $1 per capita as a contribution. Other cities in the country provide far more financial support. The Humane Society recommends at least $3 per capita spending for animal care.
ACC's budget is composed of The Department Of Health, and the Mayor's Alliance (who gets donations from Maddie's Fund and the ASPCA). 
There is a conflict of interest between the ACC and the Department of Health. The Department of Health runs the ACC via Thomas Farley, who is the chairman of the ACC board of directors. Yet, the ACC is supposed to be an independent private charity organization contracted by the City of New York. The ACC is unable to plea for additional funds or contradict the city in any way, as city officials sit on the board of the ACC. So, budget cut after budget cut, the ACC stays silent.
There is a lawsuit that was filed that demands the Department of Health and City officials to cease involvement in the management of the ACC. 
In addition, there is a substantial budget provided from a private charity organization called Maddie's fund. This organization disburses their money through the Mayor's Animal Alliance. The organization has strict reporting and progress guidelines. They have set forth a No Kill road map for the ACC. In 2010, according to this road map - the ACC can no longer kill for space. In order to comply with these regulations, the ACC notes false reasons for the reason they kill cats and dogs. Some of the reasons provided are "ill", "temper", "too young." The ACC has killed cats and dogs for being 8 weeks old, for having a treatable cold, and for having such things like gingivitis.
In December 2010, ABC News reported that conditions at the ACC are deplorable. They confirmed that healthy adoptable cats and dogs have been killed. 
Dogs that are housebroken are not walked, sometimes for over 24 hours. Cats and dogs sit in deplorable conditions. Kittens are deemed to have "temper" and are killed. And not once is "space" mentioned as an issue.

Satyasiddhi

The Satyasiddhi (Ch.: Ch'eng Shih Tsung; Pinyin: Cheng Shi Zong or Chengshizong; Jp.:Jōjitsu-shu; 成實宗) school of Buddhism is based on the text known as the Satyasiddhi-Shastra (成實論; Ch.: Ch'eng Shih Lun; Jp.: Jōjitsu-ron), authored by the Indian master Harivarman. This treatise possibly arose during the first half of the fourth century, reaching the modern days through its Chinese translation only, by Kumarajiva.
Its main initial expounders in China were called the "Three Great Masters of the Liang Dynasty": Seng-min (僧旻) (467–527 AD), Chih-tsang (智蔵) (458–522 AD) e Fa-yun (法雲) (467–529 AD). The three of them in turn received instructions in this treatise from the monk Hui-tz'u (慧次) (434–490 AD). The three of them also possibly influenced the writing of the Sangyō Gisho, a sutra commentary supposedly authored by Prince Shōtoku.
It was supposedly introduced to Japan as Jōjitsu in 625.

Port of Manchester

History.
On 1 January 1894 a steamer owned by the Cooperative Wholesale Society, the "Pioneer", unloaded its cargo of sugar from Rouen, claiming the honour of being the first merchant vessel to be registered in the Port of Manchester. Initially, the port struggled to compete with the more established ports, partly because of the inertia of the influential shipping conferences (cartels). In 1908, although Manchester had about 75 per cent of the mule spindles in the United Kingdom, only 14 per cent of the raw material used in cotton spinning passed through the Port of Manchester. Despite the competition, trade grew steadily. Between 1895 and 1896, 121,336 bales of cotton were imported from America, the main source of cotton; this increased to 377,264 bales in 1907–1908. The Port of Manchester was not the major destination for American cotton in the early 20th century, but it was for Egyptian cotton. In 1907–1908 about half of the cotton used in Lancashire cotton mills passed through the port, about 216,570 bales. In the early-20th century, the main produce travelling through the port was timber, grain, and cotton. The grain trade expanded more than tenfold, increasing from in 1895 to in 1907.
Based on value of import and export trade, between 1904 and 1964 the Port of Manchester was in the top five most important custom ports in the UK for 39 out of the 55 years for which figures exist. The peak year for tonnage was 1959, but the port declined in the 1960s because of the increasing size of ocean-going vessels, most of which could not enter the canal.
Manchester Liners.
Manchester Liners was established on 3 May 1898, to provide a fortnightly transatlantic service between the Port of Manchester and North America, via the Manchester Ship Canal. Its first purpose-built ship, "Manchester City", launched on 27 October 1898, was designed to suit the dimensions of the canal, and was fitted with telescopic masts to allow it to pass under the bridges along the canal. The success of its inaugural trip to Halifax, Nova Scotia, encouraged Manchester Liners to order seven more ships to the same design. The company continued to operate vessels registered in Manchester for more than 80 years, until 1985.

LGBT Danmark

LGBT Danmark – Landsforeningen for bøsser, lesbiske, biseksuelle og transpersoner () is a lobby for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals. The association was founded in 1948 as "Circle of 1948" ("Kredsen af 1948"). The current name has been in use since November 2009; its former name, in use for 24 years prior, was Landsforeningen for Bøsser og Lesbiske, Forbundet af 1948, shortened to "LBL".
History.
The association’s founder and first chairman was Axel Lundahl Madsen, later Axel Axgil, who held the chairman position until 1952. Inspired by the Declaration of Human Rights in Paris on the 10 December 1948, he, together with his partner Eigil Eskildsen (later also Axgil) and some friends, founded the association under the name "Kredsen af 1948", which in 1949 became "Forbundet af 1948", or short "F-48". By 1951, F-48's membership had grown to 1,339. in 2009 the current name was introduced.
The couple also published the first issue of an illegal paper with homoerotic content, "Vennen" (The Friend), in 1949, and continued to publish from 1959 until 1970.
Aims.
For the majority of its existence, LGBT Denmark has been a lobby for gays and lesbians, but since 2002 bisexuals and since 2008 transpersons have also been officially included.
LGBT Denmark’s aim is to work for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people’s political, social, cultural and workplace equality at every level of society. The association seeks to work against discrimination and to function as a dedicated lobby for the purpose of influencing lawmakers, for example in areas such as marriages, adoption, the artificial insemination of lesbians, and rights for transpersons.
From January 1954 onwards the association published a magazine, "Panbladet". Since December 2007 the publication has been on temporary hold due to financial problems.
On the 22nd June 1983, Copenhagen's gay radio station Radio Rosa was founded by the LBL. It later operated independently of the association, but closed down in 2010.

Town Holdings Committee

The Select Committee of Parliament on Town Holdings ran for nearly six years, finally reporting in 1892. Its chair was Lewis Fry, a solicitor and town councillor from Bristol.
The rapid expansion of the population of industrial cities and towns in the early years of the nineteenth century led to the growth of vast urban slums. The realization that overcrowded living conditions were a danger to public health resulted in several parliamentary investigations on town planning.
Several Select Committees examined proposals for redeveloping parts of London. The Town Holdings Committee investigated the land tenure systems in force in towns throughout Great Britain and Ireland, landlord-tenant relations and municipal finance.
The committee was appointed on 18 March 1896 with the mebership of Mr. Mellor, Mr. Wodehouse, Lord William Compton, Viscount Wolmer, Mr. Asher, Mr. Lewis Fry, Mr. Edward Russell, Mr. Conybeare, Mr. Goschen, Sir Henry James, Mr. Lawson, Mr. Saunders, Mr. Arthur Balfour, Mr. Gibson, Mr. Macartney, Mr. Tyssen Amherst, Viscount Folkstone, Mr. Sidney Herbert, Mr. Gregory, Sir John Ellis, Mr. Bartley, Mr. Crilly, Mr. O'Dogherty, and Colonel Nolan 
The 1897 report included a census of housing which includes details of leases and building operations in progress as well as of the number, quality and types of houses in two hundred and fifty large towns in England and Wales.

Zizia aurea (Golden Alexanders, Golden zizia) is a flowering perennial forb of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Golden Alexanders is hardy in USDA zones 4-9. It can be found from New Brunswick to Saskatchewan in Canada, south to Florida and Texas in the United States.
This native North American flower usually ranges in height from forty centimeters to seventy five centimeters tall but can sometimes grow taller. The leaves of the Golden Alexanders can up to eight centimeters long and five centimeters wide. They are normally lanceolate or ovate. Other distinguishing factors of the leaves are that they have serrated edges as well as two or three lobes in the leaf.
Golden Alexanders blooms from May to June. Its flowers are yellow and bunched at the top of the plant. Each flower is only three millimeters long and has five sepals, five petals, and five stamens. Each flower produces a single three to four millimeter long, oblong, green fruit capsule. These fruits change color as the year goes on. Each one contains a brown seed. In the fall both the leaves and the fruit turn purple.
Range and habitat.
It is most often found in habitats such as moist black soil prairies, openings in moist to mesic woodlands, savannas, thickets, limestone glades and bluffs, power line clearings in woodland areas, abandoned fields, and wet meadows. Golden Alexanders is known for its ability to survive dry summers even though it prefers wet habitats.

Tightrope CCL

Tightrope CCL is a veterinary orthopedic surgical method developed to provide a minimally invasive procedure for extracapsular stabilization of the canine cranial cruciate ligament-deficient stifle joint. The cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) stabilizes the dog knee much like the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) does in humans. 
There are several modalities currently being used in the treatment of cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) deficiency, which is a common and costly problem in dogs and sometimes cats. The Tightrope CCL technique utilizes a very strong suture material called FiberTape and isometric placement of small bone tunnels to provide bone-to-bone fixation while not causing the trauma of cutting through the bone of the tibia like a TPLO - tibial plateau leveling osteotomy or TTA - Tibial tuberosity advancement procedure. The objective of TightRope CCL is to counteract cranial tibial thrust, drawer, and internal rotation while providing optimal joint range of motion.

William A. Clemens, Jr.

Dr. William "Bill" A. Clemens, Jr. (May 15, 1932) is a professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley. He has been on the faculty of the Department of Integrated Biology since 1994, and since 1967 in the Department of Paleontology (now part of the Department of Integrative Biology) and the UC Museum of Paleontology. Clemens is also a past director of the museum (1987–1989) and chair of the Department of Paleontology (1987–1989). He has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (1974–75), a U.S. Senior Scientist Award by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the Romer-Simpson Medal (2006), and was made a Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences.
Early life and education.
Clemens was born in Berkeley, California. After graduating from Berkeley High School, he attended the University of California, Berkeley, earning a B.A. in paleontology in 1954 and a Ph.D. in 1960. From 1961 to 1967, he served as faculty in the Zoology Department at the University of Kansas and as the curator of higher vertebrates in their Museum of Natural History.
Research.
Clemens' research has focussed on the evolution of mammals in the Mesozoic Era, both their origin and diversification as well as the microstructure of the early mammalian jaw and teeth. He is also noted for his research into the extinction of the dinosaurs at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–T boundary). Clemens' research supports a view contrary to the more familiar Alvarez hypothesis model of sudden catastrophic extinction precipitated by an asteroid, which was proposed in part by Walter Alvarez, also at the University of California, Berkeley, at the time. Clemens research in western North America suggests that the dinosaurs were already undergoing gradual extinction prior to the end of the Cretaceous and that other groups of vertebrates were not severely impacted by the event.

<doc id="18922036" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18922036" title="General medical examination">
General medical examination

The general medical examination is a common form of preventive medicine involving visits to a general practitioner by asymptomatic adults on a regular basis. This is generally yearly or less frequently. It is known under several other names, such as the periodic health evaluation, annual physical, comprehensive medical exam, general health check, or preventive health examination.
The term is generally "not" meant to include visits for the purpose of newborn checks, Pap smears for cervical cancer, or regular visits for people with certain chronic medical disorders (for example, diabetes). The general medical examination generally involves a medical history, a (brief or complete) physical examination and sometimes laboratory tests. Some more advanced tests include ultrasound and mammography.
Usefulness.
Although annual medical examinations are a routine practice in several countries, it is poorly supported by scientific evidence in the majority of the population. A 2012 Cochrane review did not find any benefit with respect to the risk of death or poor outcomes related to disease in those who received them. People who undergo yearly medical exams however are more likely to be diagnosed with medical problems.
Some notable health organisations recommend against annual examinations. The American Cancer Society recommends a cancer-related health check-up annually in men and women older than 40, and every three years for those older than 20.
A systematic review of studies until September 2006 concluded that the examination does result in better delivery of some other screening interventions (such as Pap smears, cholesterol screening, and faecal occult blood tests) and less patient worry. Evidence supports several of these individual screening interventions. The effects of annual check-ups on overall costs, patient disability and mortality, disease detection, and intermediate end points such a blood pressure or cholesterol, are inconclusive. A recent study found that the examination is associated with increased participation in cancer screening.
The lack of good evidence contrasts with population surveys showing that the general public is fond of these examinations, especially when they are free of charge. Despite guidelines recommending against routine annual examinations, many family physicians perform them. A fee-for-service healthcare system has been suggested to promote this practice. An alternative would be to tailor the screening interval to the age, sex, medical conditions and risk factors of each patient. This means choosing between a wide variety of tests.
The arguments for and against are similar for many other screening interventions. The possible advantages include detection and subsequent prevention or early treatment for conditions such as high blood pressure, alcohol abuse, smoking, unhealthy diet, obesity and various cancers. Moreover, they could improve the patient-physician relationship and decrease patient anxiety. New York doctor finds that more and more private insurance companies and even Medicare include annual physical in their coverage. Some employers require a mandatory health checkup before hiring a candidate. Most surgeons will ask a patient for his or her recent general medical examination results in order to proceed with the surgery. Disadvantages cited include the time and money that could be saved by a more targeted screening (health economics argument), a possible increased anxiety over health risks (medicalisation), overdiagnosis and harm resulting from unnecessary testing to detect or confirm medical problems.
Prevalence.
It is commonly performed in the United States and the United Kingdom, whereas the practice varies among mainland European countries.
History.
The roots of the periodic medical examination are not entirely clear. They seem to have been advocated since the 1920s. Some authors point to pleads from the 19th and early 20th century for the early detection of diseases like tuberculosis, and periodic school health examinations. The advent of medical insurance and related commercial influences seems to have promoted the examination, whereas this practice has been subject to controversy in the age of evidence-based medicine. Several studies have been performed before current evidence-based recommendation for screening were formulated, limiting the applicability of these studies to current-day practice.

Something Cool

Something Cool is a studio album recorded by June Christy in 1953, 1954, and 1955, and featuring Christy singing 11 (in the original release, seven) jazz songs backed by the orchestra of Pete Rugolo. First issued in 1954 as a 10" mono LP, an expanded 12" mono LP was released the following year, with four newly recorded selections added to the track listing. In 1960, Christy and Rugolo re-recorded all 11 selections in stereo, so that a stereo version of "Something Cool" could be issued. For many years, this re-recorded version of the LP was the only one commercially available.
Christy had been associated with "cool" jazz since her vocal work with the Stan Kenton Orchestra in the 1940s and early 1950s. As well as launching her career as a solo artist, "Something Cool", according to jazz writer John Bush, was responsible for launching a whole cool movement in jazz singing. It was the first of 18 June Christy albums, most of them recorded with the backing of Pete Rugolo. This debut turned out extremely successful, the album reaching the Top 20 album charts in America.
Release history.
Originally released on the Capitol label as a 10" LP (1954, mono) and a 12" LP (1955, mono), "Something Cool" was re-recorded in stereo with a slightly different personnel and released again under the same title in 1960. It was later rereleased on CD in 1991 with the songs of the 1955 mono LP plus 13 additional tracks, all recorded between 1953 and 1955. Controversially, the songs were sequenced in the order they were recorded, meaning that this package did not duplicate the original running sequence of the album.
In 2001, another CD reissue combined the 11 songs of the original 12" mono LP with the same 11 songs as reissued in stereo in 1960, but leaving out all the "bonus tracks" that did not originally appear on either LP.

The original release of "Something Cool" consisted of seven tracks.

This was an entirely re-recorded album, but it duplicated the track listing of the 1955 12" LP (above) track-for-track.
Original CD issue (1991).
This CD presented a range of tracks Christy recorded between 1953 and 1955, including the entirety of the 12" mono "Something Cool" LP, albeit not in its original running order. 
Note: Tracks 2, 14, 21, 23, and 24, recorded from 1953 to 1955, were originally released on the album "This Is June Christy" in 1958. Tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 11, and 22, also recorded from 1953 to 1955, were originally issued only as 45-rpm singles. Tracks 16 and 17 were released for the first time on this CD. This release included the complete contents of the original mono 12" LP release of "Something Cool", but not the stereo release. 
CD reissue (2001).
In 2001, another CD release appeared, which included only the tracks that appeared on the original "Something Cool" 12" LP releases. The program consisted of the mono 12" LP tracks, in their original running order, followed by the stereo 12" LP tracks, again in their original running order.

Hardial Singh Johal

A chief engineer for the Vancouver School Board, Hardial Singh Johal was an avid follower of Talwinder Singh Parmar, and thus closely eyed in the investigation following the bombing of Air India Flight 182. He was alleged to have stored the suitcase explosives in the basement of a Vancouver school, and to have purchased the tickets for the flights on which the bombs were placed.
Moments after a wiretapped phonecall with Parmar on June 20, 1985, a man phoned Canadian Pacific Airlines where he spoke to ticket agent Martine Donahue, and purchased two tickets - one for a "Mohinderbel Singh" for Air India Flight 301 to Tokyo, and another under the name of "Jaswand Singh" for CP Air Flight 086, which was connecting to the Air India flight. The contact phone number left with the ticket agent became one of the first leads tracked by investigators, and was owned by Johal.
The initial phone conversation, as translated, included the following exchange;
It is believed that "writing the story" referred to purchasing the tickets for the flight, and after the tickets were purchased, Johal phoned Parmar back and asked if he could "come over and read the story he asked for", to which Parmar agreed.
His house was raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on November 6, 1985 along with the residences of Talwinder Singh Parmar, Inderjit Singh Reyat, Surjan Singh Gill and Manmohan Singh.
On November 15, 2002, Johal died of natural causes at the age of 55.

Ponce de Leon Heights (Decatur)

Ponce de Leon Heights is a historic neighborhood in the west section of the Atlanta, Georgia suburb of Decatur. It includes single family residences and a church, primarily built in the early 1900s. The neighborhood is located between Scott Blvd. to the northwest, Ponce de Leon Avenue to the south and Coventry Road to the east. Although the neighborhood partially fronts on Ponce de Leon Avenue, there are no commercial businesses.
Architecture.
The name of the community is apparently derived from fronting on the north side of Ponce de Leon Avenue, and from the hilly terrain of west Decatur. Ponce de Leon Heights homes were primarily constructed starting in 1914, sit on small lots and include many examples of Craftsman Bungalows architectural style. Streets in the community include Clarion Ave., Nelson Ferry Rd., Woodlawn Ave., Fairfield St. and the southeast leg of Coventry Rd.
Although not directly connected to the other neighborhood roads, Pinetree Dr. falls within the greater community boundaries. However, homes and lots on Pinetree Dr. are substantially larger than neighboring roads. This street is architecturally distinct from the other streets, and a parcel adjoining Ponce de Leon Ave. was developed as cluster housing.
Parks.
Ponce de Leon Heights does not have a City of Decatur or DeKalb County park. However, the church playground is open to residents.

USS Santa Clara (ID-4523)

USS "Santa Clara" (ID-4523) was a for the United States Navy during World War I. In service for the United States Army she was known as USAT "Santa Clara". Both before and after her World War I service she was known as SS "Santa Clara" for the Grace Line.
Career.
SS "Santa Clara", a single-screw, steel-hulled freighter built during 1913 by William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was chartered by the United States Army on 28 October 1917 for voyages to the European war zone and given a Naval Armed Guard. "Santa Clara" was acquired by the Navy on 17 September 1918 from the Grace Line of New York, and commissioned on 12 October 1918 at Baltimore, Maryland, with Lieutenant Commander F. S. Blackadar, USNRF, in command.
Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, "Santa Clara" arrived at Marseille on 15 November 1918, four days after the Armistice was signed, bringing 6,655 tons of general cargo. After returning to Baltimore on 24 December 1918, "Santa Clara" was transferred, on 18 January 1919, to the Cruiser and Transport Force of the Atlantic Fleet.
After overhaul, "Santa Clara" departed New York, on 23 March 1919, for the first of four post-war voyages to Europe returning troops to the United States from the war zone. Operating from New York, "Santa Clara" called at Brest, Bordeaux, Saint-Nazaire, and Pauillac, France, before completing her last voyage at Brooklyn on 3 August 1919. The following day, she was transferred from the Atlantic Fleet to the Third Naval District. "Santa Clara" was decommissioned on 19 August 1919 at New York and simultaneously returned to her owner.
"Santa Clara"'s ultimate fate is not known.

Semantic parameterization

Semantic parameterization is a conceptual modeling process for expressing natural language descriptions of a domain in first-order predicate logic. The process yields a formalization of natural language sentences in Description Logic to answer the "who," "what" and "where" questions in the Inquiry-Cycle Model (ICM) developed by Colin Potts and his colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The parameterization process complements the Knowledge Acquisition and autOmated Specification (KAOS) method, which formalizes answers to the "when", "why" and "how" ICM questions in Temporal Logic, to complete the ICM formalization. The artifacts used in the parameterization process include a dictionary that aligns the domain lexicon with unique concepts, distinguishing between synonyms and polysemes, and several natural language patterns that aid in mapping common domain descriptions to formal specifications.
Relationship to other theories.
Semantic Parameterization defines a meta-model consisting of eight roles that are domain-independent and reusable. Seven of these roles correspond to Jeffrey Gruber's thematic relations and case roles in Charles Fillmore's case grammar:
The Inquiry-Cycle Model (ICM) was introduced to drive elicitation between engineers and stakeholders in requirements engineering. The ICM consists of "who", "what", "where", "why", "how" and "when" questions. All but the "when" questions, which require a Temporal Logic to represent such phenomena, have been aligned with the meta-model in semantic parameterization using Description Logic (DL).
Introduction with Example.
The semantic parameterization process is based on Description Logic, wherein the TBox is composed of words in a "dictionary", including nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and the ABox is partitioned into two sets of assertions: 1) those assertions that come from words in the natural language statement, called the "grounding", and 2) those assertions that are inferred by the (human) modeler, called the "meta-model". Consider the following unstructured natural language statement (UNLS) (see Breaux et al. for an extended discussion):
UNLS1.0: The customer1,1 must not share2,2 the access-code3,3 of the customer1,1 with someone4,4 who is not the provider5,4.
The modeler first identifies intensional and extensional polysemes and synonyms, denoted by the subscripts: the first subscript uniquely refers to the intensional index, i.e., the same first index in two or more words refer to the same concept in the TBox; the second subscript uniquely refers to the extensional index, i.e., two same second index in two or more words refer to the same individual in the ABox. This indexing step aligns words in the statement and concepts in the dictionary. Next, the modeler identifies concepts from the dictionary to compose the meta-model. The following table illustrates the complete DL expression that results from applying semantic paramterization.

A386 road (England)

The A386 is a primary route in Devon, England. It runs from Plymouth on the south coast to Appledore on the north coast.
The road starts in the centre of Plymouth, and forms Tavistock Road, the main route out of the city to the north. It crosses a section of Dartmoor to Yelverton and Tavistock. The A386 then heads northeast across the western fringe of Dartmoor past the village of Lydford to the A30 west of Okehampton. It passes to the west of Okehampton to reach Hatherleigh, where the road joins the valley of the River Torridge. It follows the valley to, Meeth, Merton, Great Torrington, Bideford and finally Appledore.
History.
The route is little changed from its original alignment in 1922. It originally ended at Bideford, and was extended north first to Northam and then to Appledore on the former route of the B3236. The route originally went through the town of Okehampton. In about 1971 it was realigned to its present route on the former route of the B3219. In the north of Plymouth the road was rebuilt in the 1970s to bypass the village of Crownhill.

The band's debut EP "Building Blocks" was written, recorded, mixed and mastered by Steer in the bedroom of his London flat. Steer has stated that he did not originally plan on being the lead vocalist, but recorded vocals on the tracks as a guide, with the intention of replacing them at a later stage.
The song "Get Up And Go", was used in a television advertisement in the UK for the energy supplier E.ON and is currently (winter of 2010) being used in an ad for Volvo V60 in Scandinavia. "Don't Weigh Me Down" was used in the opening scene of UK TV soap Hollyoaks, episode aired Channel 4 July 31, 2008. "Pep Talk" was used in a movie trailer for the 2013 film Delivery Man (film) starring Vince Vaughn. "Run" also features on Apple's 2008 "MacBook Green" commercial. As of July 2009 the song "Rouse Your Bones" has been used to back UK charity Christian Aid in its 'Poverty Over' internet advertising campaign. The song 'Get Up And Go' can be heard in the final scene of American TV show 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' Season 10, episode 13, aired on CBS in US and Channel 5 in UK in 2010. A few songs, including "I Hold My Breath," were used in a GLBT-themed short titled All I Ever Wanted. 
The band's debut album "Broadcast 2000" was recorded by Steer, with additional production by Eliot James (who has previously worked with Kaiser Chiefs and Bloc Party amongst others) and features violin by Noah and the Whale's Tom 'Fiddle' Hobden. Songs from the album have received substantial radio airplay on BBC 6Music, BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2 and XFM. With live sessions on 6Music's Marc Riley and George Lamb shows as well as John Kennedy's XFM show. The band have also performed on the BBC Introducing stage at Glastonbury Festival 2010, SXSW music festival in Austin Texas, and as part of The Roundhouse Emerging Proms events in London.

Cho Jae-hyun

Cho Jae-hyun (born June 30, 1965) is a South Korean film, stage, and TV actor. He is commonly dubbed "director Kim Ki-duk's persona" since Cho has starred as leading and supporting characters in almost all films directed by Kim. 
Early years and education.
Cho Jae-hyun was born in Seoul in 1965. He and his family lived in a poor neighborhood on the slopes of a hill until his father became successful with his restaurant business in the Jongno area, Seoul. In a 2002 interview with the film magazine Cine21, Cho said he was a rebellious boy wandering outside the home. He aspired to be a painter, so tried to enter an art high school but failed. When he entered another high school, Cho ran away from home to Busan. Cho worked as a waiter there, and studied on his own to pass a qualification exam equivalent to obtaining a high school diploma. However, Cho failed it, so returned to Seoul to finish his high school year. 
Cho was admitted to study theater and film at Kyungsung University. Cho recollected he indulged himself in Busan's culture as a freshman and sophomore, then focused on theater for the rest of his university years. Cho said a question from his junior in school during his third summer break shook him to rethink about his future; "What would you do after the graduation from the school?" Cho said he felt shame at the time because he could not clearly answer the question. Therefore, Cho started dedicating himself to acting.
Acting career.
After graduation, Cho was selected as a TV actor by a public recruit of Korea Broadcasting System (KBS), and officially debuted as a professional actor by starring as the youngest brother of Yu In-chon in "The Age of Ambition" (야먕의 세월). But theater remained his main priority, as Cho and his friends established a theatrical company named "Jongak" (종각, literally "Bell Pavilion"), which produced several works on the stage such as "Tricycles" (세발자전거, 1989), "Look Back in Anger" (성난 얼굴로 돌아보라, 1990) and "The Lovers of Woomook-baemi" (우묵배미의 사랑, 1990). In 1991, Cho won Best New Actor in Theater at the Baeksang Arts Awards for his acting in "Equus"; he reinterpreted the leading role Alan Strang as an innocent person, though he is largely depicted as a cruel and rebellious character. 
In 2009, Cho revisited "Equus" by directing the play and playing the other lead character Martin Dysart. This was part of the highly successful "Yeongeuk Yeoljeon" ("A Series of the Best Plays"), of which Cho was the programmer in 2008-2009. Cho was praised for reinvigorating the faltering local theater scene in Daehangno by coming up with the series and its star-studded casting, promotion and marketing.
Other activities.
Cho is also the chairman of the Gyeonggi Film Council since 2009, executive festival director of the DMZ Korean International Documentary Film Festival (DMZ Docs) since 2009, chairman of the Gyeonggi Arts Center since 2010, an associate professor at Sungshin Women's University's College of Convergence Culture and Arts since 2012, and an associate professor at Kyungsung University's Department of Theater and Film since 2014.
Personal life.
When Cho Jae-hyun was 24 years old in 1989, he married his university sweetheart who was an anchor for the university TV.

Yesmail

Yesmail Interactive, an infogroup company, is an email marketing solutions provider headquartered in Portland, Oregon and has offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, Omaha, Toronto, London and Singapore.
History.
Yesmail first started as a Web directory in 1995 and was later named Starting Point Directory in 1997. The website became one of the top 10 most visited sites on the web and was operated by co-owner and webmaster, Frank Addante, serial entrepreneur. The company was created after its initial business, WebPromote, Inc. and its founders, Ken Wruk, Kevin Manley, John Weiss, and Keith Speer merged with a new firm founded by Mike Santer, Alex Hern and executives David Tolmie (CEO) and Peder Jungck (CTO) in early 1999. The new firm was named Yesmail.com and built a rapidly growing email marketing business with many large clients. The business grew based on its ability to use technology to manage its database of millions of e-mail addresses. Yesmail’s growth led to a $37 million IPO in the fall of 1999, and was acquired by CMGI in 2000 for $520 million. Yesmail was later acquired by infoUSA in 2003.
In November, 2006, Yesmail agreed to pay a $50,717 civil penalty to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it violated the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 by sending unsolicited commercial e-mails after consumers asked it to stop doing so. The FTC charged Yesmail, "doing business as @Once" at the time of the violation in 2004, with sending e-mail messages on behalf of its clients more than 10 business days after recipients had opted out. Citing the problem as one of the minor technical issues allowed under the Act, and not a violation of federal law, Yesmail deemed the charges too costly to fight, and agreed to settle. "Doing business as @Once" means the issue related to an incident that took place in 2004 before @once Inc. (then a Portland, OR-based e-mail marketing company) was integrated (along with its liabilities) in 2005 with infoUSA's existing e-mail subsidiary Yesmail.
Yesmail carefully analyzes email legislation and takes compliance very seriously. Although disappointed by the resolution of this matter, Yesmail fully supports the CAN-SPAM legislation and the FTC's efforts for strict enforcement of this important law. Yesmail does not believe that it has in any way violated the provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act. However, it determined that settling this matter without admission of liability was the most attractive alternative.

John Mush

John Mush (alias Ratcliffe) (b. in Yorkshire, 1551 or 1552; d. at Wenge, Buckinghamshire, 1612 or 1613) was an English Roman Catholic priest, the confessor to Margaret Clitherow.
Life.
Having spent six months in the English College at Douai, he went to Rome (1576) where he studied for seven years. Ordained priest, he returned to England (1583) and laboured at York, being confessor, to Margaret Clitherow who was executed for harbouring him, and Francis Ingleby. Arrested 28 October 1586, and condemned to die, he escaped with two other priests. 
For many years he worked on mission in the North, becoming a recognized leader among his brother priests. When the dissensions among the imprisoned priests at Wisbech Castle broke out in 1595 (the so-called "Wisbech Stirs"), he with Dr. Dudley went there to arbitrate. Failing in this, together with John Colleton he set himself to devise some organization of a voluntary character among the clergy which might supply the want of episcopal government much felt after the death of Cardinal William Allen in 1594. Opposed by Robert Persons, it was rendered superfluous by the appointment of an archpriest (1599). 
In the ensuing archpriest controversy Mush was one of the appellant clergy who appealed to Rome against the archpriest. Against the "Adversus factiosos in ecclesia" circulated by Thomas Lister, Mush wrote "Declaratio Motuum" (1601) collecting documentation, and in 1602, with Anthony Champney, Bluet and Cecil, went as a deputation to Rome where for eight months they fought for their petition. Their petition, first for six bishops and then for six archpriests, was refused; but though the archpriest succeeded in maintaining his position, the appellants were acquitted of the charges of rebellion and schism. 
On his return to England, Mush was one of the thirteen priests who signed the protestation of allegiance to Elizabeth I of England (1603). In his later years he acted as assistant to two successive archpriests, George Blackwell and George Birkhead, in Yorkshire, but he seems to have been acting as chaplain to Lady Dormer in Buckinghamshire at the time of his death.
Works.
His works are:
His diary of the deputation to Rome in 1602 was preserved in manuscript, in the Inner Temple, London. Dodd also says he wrote against the apostate priest Thomas Bell, and John Pitts quotes his English translation of "Lectiones Panagorali Turini", but these works are not now known to exist.

USNS Coastal Crusader (T-AGM-16)

USNS "Coastal Crusader" (T-AGM-16) was acquired by the United States Navy as a missile range instrumentation ship in 1964. Originally, she was constructed at the end of World War II as USS "Wexford" (AK-220) and then renamed "Coastal Crusader", but she was found to be excess-to-needs, and was sold for commercial use. She was later acquired by the U.S. Army which used her as Army transport USAT "Private Joe R. Hastings".
The ship was later acquired by the U.S. Air Force, and redesignated "Ocean Range Vessel" USAFS "Coastal Crusader" (ORV-16). And, in 1964, she was reacquired by the United States Navy and redesignated USNS "Coastal Crusader" (T-AGM-16), a missile range instrumentation ship.
The ship—eventually maintaining the name "Coastal Crusader" -- had the distinction of serving the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Navy, as well as serving with her commercial sisters.
Built in Wisconsin.
"Coastal Crusader" -- a C1-M-AV1 cargo vessel—was laid down under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 2174) on 12 April 1945 at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, by the Leathern D. Smith Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 24 June 1945; sponsored by Mrs. DeForrest Colburn; and completed on 26 July 1945.
On 25 February 1945, the Navy had assigned the name "Wexford" and the designation "AK-220" to the projected ship; but the contract for her acquisition by the Navy was cancelled in August 1945 because of the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean and the surrender of Japan. "Coastal Crusader" thus entered mercantile service, never having borne the name "Wexford".
Service with the U.S. Army.
The vessel was placed in service (date unknown) by the U.S. Army Transportation Service as USAT "Private Joe R. Hastings".
Service with the U.S. Air Force.
"Coastal Sentry" was acquired by the U.S. Air Force which redesignated her "Ocean Range Vessel" USAFS "Coastal Crusader" (ORV-16). She was used as a missile range instrumentation ship which operated on the U.S. Air Force's Eastern Test Range during the late 1950s and early 1960s. "Coastal Crusader" operated under an Air Force contract with Pan American Airways Guided Missile Range Division headquartered in Cocoa Beach, Florida.
"Coastal Crusader" was assigned to the South Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean area, and provided the Air Force with metric data on intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida. 
"Coastal Crusader" operated in the intercontinental ballistic missile re-entry area near Ascension Island, and was home-ported out of Recife, Brazil.
Service with the U.S. Navy.
When "Coastal Crusader" was acquired from the U.S. Air Force in 1964, the Navy redesignated the ship as USNS "Coastal Crusader" (T-AGM-16). Operational data while on U.S. Navy service during this period of the vessel's history is lacking. However, Navy records indicate "Coastal Crusader" was redesignated "Survey Ship" USS "Coastal Crusader" (AGS-36) in 1969, and finally struck from the Navy List on 30 April 1976.
Inactivation.
"Coastal Crusader" was subsequently sold by MARAD on 12 April 1977. Her ultimate fate is not known.

USS Santa Cecilia (ID-4008)

USS "Santa Cecilia" (ID-4008) was the lead ship of her class of freighters of the United States Navy during World War I. In service for the United States Army she was known as USAT "Santa Cecilia". Both before and after her World War I service she was known as SS "Santa Cecilia" for the Grace Line.
Career.
SS "Santa Cecilia", a single-screw, steel-hulled freighter built during 1913 by William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Co. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was chartered by the United States Army during World War I. "Santa Cecilia" was taken over by the Navy at New York on 10 March 1919; and commissioned the same day.
"Santa Cecilia" was one of four U.S. Army ships manned by the Navy in March 1919 after conversion to troop transports by the Army. She sailed from Hoboken, New Jersey, on 11 April 1919 for Bordeaux, France, and returned to New York on 9 May with homeward-bound troops. She completed her fourth and last round-trip voyage on 7 September 1919, and was transferred to the United States Shipping Board on 6 October 1919.
Following mercantile service, "Santa Cecilia" was broken up in 1935.

History.
The origin of the Provincial Archives dates back to 1906 when Katharine Hughes served as the first Provincial Archivist within the Provincial Library. Through the years the holdings continued to grow.
In 1962, the Government of Alberta established a Museums Branch under the Department of the Provincial Secretary for the establishment of a Provincial Archives and a Provincial Museum. The Branch began to accept archival records from government and private sources in 1963. In 1965 work began on a new Provincial Museum and Archives building in the Glenora district of Edmonton. Work finished and the building officially opened in 1967.
As the years went by the Provincial Archives of Alberta outgrew its space and began to warehouse collections, and the need for a larger building became apparent. The Provincial Archives officially opened the doors to its new location at 8555 Roper Road NW in Edmonton on October 5, 2003. The custom 11000 m2 building is situated on a six hectare (14.8 acre) site in southeast Edmonton. 
Funding for the construction of the new building was made possible through grants from the Alberta Centennial Legacies Grant Program

Russell Mulcahy

Russell Mulcahy (born 23 June 1953 in Melbourne, Australia) is an Australian film director. Mulcahy's work is recognizable by the use of fast cuts, tracking shots and use of glowing lights as well as being one of the most prominent music video directors of the 1980s. He has also worked in television since the early 1990s, and is currently working as a director on episodes of MTV's "Teen Wolf".
Music videos.
Russell Mulcahy's career began as a film editor for Australia's Seven Network. After relocating to the UK around 1976, Mulcahy made successful music videos for several noted British pop acts—his early UK credits included XTC's "Making Plans for Nigel" (1979), The Vapors' hit "Turning Japanese" and his landmark video for The Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star" (1979) which became the first music video played on MTV in 1981.
By the mid-1980s Mulcahy was directing videos for some of the most successful pop-rock acts of the period including The Human League, The Tubes, Elton John, Ultravox, most of the major hits of Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Kim Carnes, Bonnie Tyler, Rod Stewart, Billy Joel, The Motels, Supertramp and The Rolling Stones.
Music videography.
He also directed videos for Rod Stewart, Def Leppard, Boy George, Kenny Loggins, Arcadia, Falco, Go West, Cliff Richard, Supertramp, The Motels, Talk Talk, The Stranglers, 10cc, The Human League, XTC, and AC/DC.
"Highlander" series.
In 1986, Mulcahy became well known after directing the cult classic film "Highlander", starring Christopher Lambert and featuring music from Queen. He later directed the sequel, "Highlander II: The Quickening", but disowned it after the producers interfered with production. Reportedly he wanted to have his credit changed to Alan Smithee, but as he was not a member of the Directors Guild of America, he had no way of forcing the producers to change the credit. He eventually took the opportunity to restore his vision for the film, to a large extent, with the video release of "Highlander II: The Renegade Version".
Personal life.
Mulcahy is gay and lives with his partner in Sydney.

Ross Jenkins (footballer born 1951)

Ross Anthony Jenkins (born 4 November 1951 in Kensington, London) is an English former footballer. He was a striker and started his career at Crystal Palace, before spending eleven years with Watford. He played for the club whilst they were both bottom and top of The Football League.
Jenkins started his career at Crystal Palace, becoming an apprentice in July 1968, and signing professional terms in November 1969. In November 1972 he was bought by Watford manager George Kirby for a club-record fee of £30,000 initially, with £5000 to come a year later. Kirby had made a series of unsuccessful bids for other players before signing Jenkins.
Jenkins' debut coincided with the club's first away win in 18 months. However, he was unable to score until late in the season, his two goals in a 5–1 win over Scunthorpe United being greeted with ironic applause from his supporters. The following season, under new manager Mike Keen, Jenkins only scored four goals in 26 appearances.
Watford were relegated from the Third Division in 1974–75 season, with Jenkins finishing top scorer with 11 goals in 34 appearances. In the summer of 1975 Jenkins chose to turn down a transfer to Huddersfield Town for a fee of £12,000. 
After a 1–0 defeat to Darlington, which Jenkins played in, their fourth game and defeat of the 1975–76 season Watford were bottom of the Fourth Division. The club had a strong second half of the season and finished eighth, with Jenkins top-scorer with 19 goals. His achievements saw him win the player of the season award. 
In summer 1977 Keen was sacked and Graham Taylor was brought in. Under Taylor Watford advanced through the leagues, with Jenkins in the side. They were promoted from the Fourth Division in 1977–78, the Third in 1978–79 and the Second in 1981–82. Jenkins played in their first game in the top flight, a 2–0 win at home to Everton and early in the 1982–83 Watford topped the league. They eventually finished second to Liverpool and Jenkins left Watford at the end of the season to play in Hong Kong.
In 1987, Jenkins briefly returned to Watford as a coach, under Dave Bassett's management. He is no relation to the Ross Jenkins who currently plays for Watford as a midfielder. [http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,10400~1360408,00.html]

Chelsea Heights &amp; Westchester Hills (Decatur)

Chelsea Heights and Westchester Hills are adjacent neighborhoods, separated by a municipal park, in the northwest corner of the Atlanta, Georgia suburb of Decatur. Chelsea Heights straddles the east and west sides of the CSX railroad tracks, falling within the City of Decatur and the unincorporated DeKalb County, respectively. The latter part, though located east of what historically was Druid Hills, is part of the Druid Hills CDP and participates in the Druid Hills Civic Association: see Chelsea Heights (Druid Hills).
Westchester Hills is fully within the city limits of Decatur, and is the more northerly of the two neighborhoods.
Chelsea Heights is the older and more historic of the two neighborhoods. It primarily contains single-family homes, but also contains a modest, low-rise condominium complex called Emory Chase, and duplex homes on North Parkwood Rd. Westchester Hills consists of single-family homes, the Decatur YMCA and a nursing home.
Both neighborhoods are north of Scott Blvd.; east of the heart of Druid Hills; and south of North Decatur. Although the neighborhoods front on Scott Blvd. and Clairemont Ave., there are no significant commercial structures other than the Decatur YMCA and the Venetian Pools Community Association, a private pool. Peavine Creek, part of the South Fork Peachtree Creek watershed, passes through these neighborhoods.
History.
The Chelsea Land Company began platting Chelsea Heights as early as 1912, but the area west of the railroad tracks (in unincorporated DeKalb County) was not platted until 1914. Construction of the first streets and residences began in the 1920s, but most of the residences were constructed in the 1940s and 1950s – after the Great Depression. The variety of residential architectural styles in Chelsea Heights are partially due to the pre/post World War II construction periods. The oldest house in the neighborhood is a much-renovated American Small house that was built in 1935 and is located at 259 Chelsea Drive. The neighborhood has retained its historic character. Only five houses were constructed in the neighborhood between the 1960s and
the present, and most of the renovations to historic houses have been compatible with the predominant historic styles of the neighborhood. Westchester Hills, on the other hand, primarily consists of single-family homes primarily built in the first half of the 1950s. Both neighborhoods have seen "tear downs" in the last 10–15 years, with the modest homes being replaced by upscale homes.
Architecture.
The name "Chelsea Heights" is derived from the name of the development company, Chelsea Land Company, and the hilly terrain of west Decatur. Despite the construction of some homes in the 1920s, the majority of Chelsea Heights homes were constructed in the post-war era. The two primary architectural styles found in the community were Minimal Traditional and Ranch style homes, but Bungalow, Cape Cod and Contemporary homes are also present in the neighborhood. Most residences have a horizontal appearance to them, and are modest in comparison to the mansions located in the heart of Druid Hills to the west. For this reason, Chelsea Heights has more in common architecturally with Decatur than with Druid Hills. The neighborhood is also notable for its curvilinear, steep roads, and for homes that sit 1-2 stories above those roads.
City of Decatur streets in the Chelsea Heights neighborhood include Chelsea Dr., Pope Cir., Mockingbird Ln., Ridley Cir., Kathryn Ave., Merrill Ave. and North Parkwood Rd. North Parkwood backs up to the CSX railroad tracks. Coventry Road is the main road that bisects the neighborhood. The middle segment of Coventry Rd. is located within Chelsea Heights' City of Decatur section; the west leg is in Druid Hills; and the east leg is in Ponce De Leon Heights. Additional streets are located in the western section of Chelsea Heights.
"Westchester Hills" derives its name from Westchester Dr., the primary east-west street in the neighborhood, and its location in the hilly terrain of west Decatur. Other streets in Westchester Hills include Maediris Way, Dogwood Way and Harold Byrd Way. The west end of Westchester Dr. backs up to the CSX railroad tracks.

Gone Fishing (2008 film)

Gone Fishing is a short film written and directed by Chris Jones, starring Bill Paterson and James Wilson, that premiered at BAFTA on 12 January 2008.
Synopsis.
"Gone Fishing" is the touching story of a boy and old man coming to terms with bereavement through their shared love of fishing, and the legend of Goliath, the biggest pike ever caught!
This thirteen minute short film was financed by 150 film makers and directed by the author of The Guerilla Film Makers Handbook, Chris Jones. 
The story is in part autobiographical - while growing up, director Chris Jones and his friends would often attempt to catch the legendary 'Oscar the pike', a fish that according to local myth terrorized the lake at the end of his road, the aptly named Blue Lagoon. This was the inspiration behind the legend of 'Goliath', the big fish in this even bigger tale.

Edie Huggins

Edie Huggins (August 14, 1935 – July 29, 2008) was an American television reporter, journalist and broadcaster. In 1966 Huggins became one of the first African-American women to report on television in Philadelphia, remaining a fixture on WCAU-TV for 42 years; the longest consecutive television run of any Philadelphia TV news reporter in history.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Huggins was born Edith "Eddie" Lou Thompson on August 14, 1935, in Saint Joseph, Missouri. She became known as Edie (pronounced "Eedee") later in life. She graduated from Bartlett High School in St. Joseph in 1953. Huggins, who still went by her given name of Edith at the time, graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in science from the State University of New York at Plattsburgh.
Huggins began her career by working as a registered nurse in New York City. She was employed by both Bellevue Hospital and Flower-Fifth Avenue Hospital. Simultaneously, Huggins was hired as a consultant for the NBC daytime soap opera, "The Doctors", which began airing in 1963. Her consulting working soon led to acting roles on the drama. Her other soap opera acting credits included "Love of Life" and "The Edge of Night" which were aired on CBS. Huggins was also cast in the 1966 film, "A Man Called Adam" opposite Sammy Davis Jr, Ossie Davis, Frank Sinatra, Jr. and Louis Armstrong.
WCAU-TV.
Huggins was initially hired as a features reporter at WCAU-TV of Philadelphia in 1966 for a show called "The Big News Team with John Facenda" following a chance encounter with a broadcast executive in a New York City restaurant. That executive was Bruce Bryan, the general manager of WCAU-TV, or Channel 10, which was a CBS network affiliate at the time. Huggins, a single mother, arrived in Philadelphia for her new job with her two children and just 65 dollars.
In a 2006 interview for her 40th anniversary with WCAU, Huggins confided that she had been hired despite a lack on-air, live television experience. She stated that the reason that she was hired was to compete against the then-local NBC affiliate, KYW-TV, which had just hired its first African American woman reporter, Trudy Haynes. Huggins, herself, made history when she joined WCAU by becoming the station's first African American female reporter.
Following her success on WCAU, the management of the television station gave Huggins her own show, "Morning Side". Huggins also co-hosted a midday news show called "What's Happening" during the early 1970s with the late Herb Clarke, weatherman. Her other shows on WCAU included "Horizons" and "Huggins' Heroes", which focused on ordinary local people who had accomplished notable achievements, especially for the benefit of the larger community. "Huggins Heroes" became a weekly profile feature on WCAU news broadcasts during the 1990s and 2000s (decade), and highlighted Huggins's reputation as a reporter who focused on "unsung heroes" throughout the Philadelphia region.
In 2006, the Philadelphia City Council honored Huggins on her 40th anniversary at WCAU (by then an NBC affiliate) by proclaiming "Edie Huggins Day" in the city. "Edie Huggins Day" was officially proclaimed with a resolution on March 30, 2006.
Huggins's other career honors included her induction into the Philadelphia Broadcast Pioneers Hall of Fame. She was also chosen by the Urban League of Philadelphia as one of the "Outstanding African American Philadelphians of the 20th century." She was also honored by the Philadelphia Chapter of American Women in Radio & Television as Communicator of the Year, awarded a lifetime achievement award by the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists and earned an award from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.
Huggins was a founding member of the National Association of Black Journalists. Professionally, Huggins was often cited by colleagues as a mentor and was affectionately referred to as "Miss Edie" by younger reporters and staff throughout the Philadelphia television news industry.
In 2006, Huggins was cast in the lead role in the independent film, "So Big". The film debuted on May 3, 2008, at International House in Philadelphia.
The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia [http://broadcastpioneers.com] inducted Edie Huggins into their Hall of Fame in 2002.
Death.
Edie Huggins died of lung cancer on July 29, 2008, at the age of 72. She was survived by her two children, Hastings Edward Huggins and Laurie Linn. A memorial service held at Huggins's church, Bright Hope Baptist Church, in North Philadelphia was attended by many members of Philadelphia's media.

Neo (UK band)

Neo was an early New Wave band which was part of the English musical scene originated by punk in the 1970s. The group was formed by the American-born singer Ian North, who was the frontman and the only continuous member from the band formation in 1977 to the end in 1979.
History.
Early days: Radio.
In 1976, Ian North (lead vocals, guitar) travelled with the band Milk 'N' Cookies for which he was the guitarist, to London to record a new album but they never made it and the group took separate ways. Only North stayed in London, meeting Brian Eno and Martin Gordon (bass), who a few years previously had founded, with ex John's Children's Andy Ellison, the glam band Jet. Gordon created a new band called Radio and Eno invited Paul Simon (drums), who formed part of Limmie Funk Limited (with Limmie Snell) to join them and completed the line-up. The band was post-punk, but after only one gig, supporting Ultravox! in November 1976, Gordon dropped out, Andy Ellison returned, and the band changed their name to Radio Stars. The band recruited George Dyner to replace Gordon, but in April 1977, North took his place on bass and continuing singing, and Paul's brother Robert was introduced on guitar.
According to Paul Simon, Radio (nowadays credited as Ian North's Radio) recorded some songs in the studio, which he remastered in 2007. In mid 1977, Paul Simon accompanied Martin Gordon, forming part of Radio Stars and recording with them ""Good Personality"", a 7" single, and other tracks, some of which were eventually released on Radio Stars' compilation "Somewhere There's A Place For Us". He was asked to stay with them, but preferred continuing with North in Neo.
Neo.
As a three piece band, Radio immediately transformed to Neo. North became the bassist, and in this way the group continued until February/March 1978, when Robert Simon dropped out and formed part of Ultravox. North sacked Paul Simon, and included session players in his project: ex-ZZebra members, Steve Byrd on guitar and John McCoy on bass, and Bryson Graham on drums. They recorded an album in Ian Gillan's studio, and after Gillan heard them, he hired Byrd and McCoy away from North. Gillan and the ex-Neo musicians formed Gillan. Only Graham stayed with North.
North renewed Neo again with Steve Wilkin (ex-Wired and Masterwitch) on guitar, Nick South on bass and Graham on drums, but shortly afterwards South and Graham were replaced by Mik Sweeney and Derek Quinton, respectively. Later Dan Black completed the line-up as keyboardist. That line-up toured with Magazine, doing gigs promoting their single ""Tran-Sister"", released that year.
After changes of line-ups, Neo split up in 1979 because North had to return to the US. Sweeney joined The News and, later, Classix Nouveaux, Steve Wilkin joined Random Hold, Quinton joined Sector 27, with Tom Robinson, and Black formed Psychic TV.
Following his return to the US, Ian North became a hairdresser and artist.

Ingleside, Dobbs Ferry

Ingleside is an American country house overlooking the Hudson River in Dobbs Ferry, New York. It is one of only three survivors of the Gothic Revival "Hudson River castles" built in the mid-nineteenth century, in the now "heavily suburbanized strip" between Riverdale, north of Manhattan, and North Tarrytown. There were at least eighteen villas with picturesque "manor house" details on this reach of the Hudson, as well as two full-blown châteaux: Strawberry Hill, Irvington (c. 1855) and Glenview, Yonkers (considerably altered, now the Hudson River Museum). Ingleside was built in 1854-57 for the English immigrant Edwin B. Strange, a silk importer in New York City, who commissioned its design from Alexander Jackson Davis, the pre-eminent American architect of picturesque villas with Gothic Revival detailing. Much of the original crenellations have been removed over the years, but the stuccoed villa still stands, housing St. Christopher's School, Dobbs Ferry.

Stryker's reagent

Stryker's reagent ([(PPh3)CuH]6), also known as the Osborn complex, is a hexameric copper hydride ligated with triphenylphosphine. It is a brick red air-sensitive solid. Stryker's reagent is a mild source of hydride and is used in homogeneous catalysis of conjugate reduction reactions of enones, enoates, and related substrates.
Preparation and structure.
The compound is prepared by hydrogenation of copper(I) "tert"-butoxide, generated in situ from copper(I) chloride and sodium "tert"-butoxide. Other more convenient methods have been developed since its discovery.
In terms of its structure, the compound is an octahedral cluster featuring Cu(PPh3) centres that are bonded by weak Cu---Cu interactions. Six of the eight faces are capped by hydride ligands.
Applications in organic synthesis.
The compound can effect highly regioselective conjugate reductions of various carbonyl derivatives including unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, and esters. This reagent was assigned as the "Reagent of the year" in 1991 for its functional group tolerance, high overall efficiency, and mild reaction conditions in the reduction reactions. Stryker's reagent is used in a catalytic amount where it is regenerated in the reaction "in situ" using a stoichiometric hydride source, often being molecular hydrogen or silanes. If stored under an inert atmosphere (e.g. argon, nitrogen) it has indefinite shelf life. Brief exposure to the oxygen does not destroy its activity significantly, although solvents used with Stryker's reagent should be rigorously degassed.
Modifications to Stryker's reagent.
Ligand-modified versions of Stryker's reagent have been reported. By changing the Ligand to e.g. P(O-iPr)3 the selectivity can be improved significantly.

John Hughey

John Hughey (December 27, 1933 – November 18, 2007) was an American musician. He was known for his work as a session pedal steel guitar player for various country music acts, most notably Vince Gill and Conway Twitty. A member of the Pedal Steel Guitar Hall of Fame, Hughey was known for a distinctive playing style called "crying steel", which focused primarily on the higher range of the guitar.
Biography.
John Hughey was born December 27, 1933 in Elaine, Arkansas. He began playing guitar at age nine, when his parents bought him an acoustic guitar from Sears. In the seventh grade, he befriended a classmate named Harold Jenkins, who would later become a prominent country singer under his stage name Conway Twitty. (Hughey and Jenkins also attended high school together.)
Influenced by Eddy Arnold's steel guitarist, Little Roy Wiggins, Hughey asked his father to buy him a lap steel guitar. Along with Jenkins and other high school friends, Hughey performed in a local band called the Phillips County Ramblers. Hughey first played professionally as a member of Slim Rhodes and The Mother's Best Mountaineers, a Memphis, Tennessee-based band. After leaving this band, Hughey joined Twitty on the road as his pedal steel guitarist, and backed Twitty from 1968 to 1988. He also recorded with various other acts, such as Marty Stuart, Willie Nelson, Elvis Presley, and Dickey Betts. By the 1980s, he began playing for Loretta Lynn, then moved on to play steel for Vince Gill for twelve years. Hughey was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 1996. In the 2000s, he and several other Nashville musicians formed a Western swing band called The Time Jumpers, who performed every Monday at a club in Nashville.
Hughey died on November 18, 2007 from heart complications, one month after having had a stent put in his heart. His funeral was held on November 21, 2007 at the First Baptist Church in Hendersonville, Tennessee.
Style and legacy.
Hughey's method of steel guitar playing was known as the "crying steel" method, because of his use of tremolo on the instrument's higher range. Vince Gill has cited Hughey as giving "definition" to his music, citing the single "Look at Us" (from 1991's "Pocket Full of Gold") as an example. According to Gill, that song's steel guitar intro "makes that song recognizable by what happens before any words even get sung." Marty Stuart, for whom Hughey played on the 1992 album "This One's Gonna Hurt You", described him as "a top drawer statesman who helped define the whole 20th century sound of country music".
Family.
For 45 years, Hughey was married to his wife, Jean, who often sat in the audience during The Time Jumpers' performances. Together, they had one daughter. Hughey also has four brothers and four sisters.

CGNET Services International

"CGNET Services Internationa", based in Menlo Park, California, is an example of an early pioneer in the field of international data communications. Beginning with landmark achievements the 1980s and 1990s CGNET has come to be one of the world’s most well-known email providers in the international nonprofit community. Founded in 1983 by Georg Lindsey, CGNET built some of the earliest international email networks, providing custom email services over the Dialcom network in 1984 and later moving to the Internet. 
Prior to the Internet, organizations usually sent mail over private data networks. While individuals could use email services on some value-added carriers, they had not been configured to serve organizations. CGNET changed this when it set up organizational communications over Dialcom. In the 1990s, it performed a similar feat by providing its customers with an early version of Voice over IP, which did not use the VoIP protocols, but made it possible to transmit voice over IP networks using statistical multiplexing.
CGNET's first client was the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), from which CGNET derived its name. Since then, virtually all of its customers are reported to be nonprofits, foundations or non-governmental organizations. CGNET's international experience includes several times when it has relocated clients' facilities or rerouted their email because their offices have been caught in the middle of armed rebellions or similar disorders.

Naziha al-Dulaimi

Naziha Jawdet Ashgah al-Dulaimi (1923, Baghdad – 9 October 2007, Herdecke) was an early pioneer of the Iraqi feminist movement. She was a cofounder and first president of the Iraqi Women League 10-3-1952, the first woman minister in Iraq’s modern history, and the first woman cabinet minister in the Arab world.
Biography.
Al-Dulaimi, whose grandfather had left al-Mahmudia (Between Baghdad and Babylon) and settled in Baghdad in the late 19th century, was born in 1923. She studied medicine at the Royal College of Medicine (later attached to University of Baghdad). At the age of 19, she was one of few female students at the Medical College. Influenced by colleagues who were deeply concerned with the plight of the people and homeland, she joined the “Women’s Society for Combating Fascism and Nazism” and was actively involved in its work. Later on, when the society changed its name to the “Association of Iraqi Women,” she became a member of its executive committee.
In 1941 she graduated as a medical doctor. While still a college student, she had become familiar with the ideals and objectives of the Iraqi Communist Party (ICP). Nominated to the party membership in 1947, she became a full member of the ICP in 1948. In January 1948, Dr Naziha was actively involved in the popular uprising “al-Wathbah” against the colonialist Portsmouth Treaty, and in other patriotic struggles. Her increasing involvement in patriotic political work, and her growing awareness of the suffering of the people, as a result of oppression by the rulers and social backwardness, convinced her of the close interconnection between the struggle for patriotic objectives and the fight for social progress.
After graduating, she was appointed in the Royal Hospital in Baghdad, and was then transferred to Karkh Hospital. Throughout that period she was subjected to harassment by the security apparatus of the monarchy, because of her sympathy for the poor and the free medical treatment she offered them at her clinic in the Shawakah district. Transferred to Sulaimaniyah (in Kurdistan), her clinic once again turned into a refuge for destitute patients who received her care and support for free. From Sulaiminiyah she was transferred to other cities and provinces (Kerbala, Umarah) as punishment for the humanitarian sentiments she had expressed towards the poor, the free medical service she offered, and her patriotic political work.
But this forcible transfer allowed the young Dr. Naziha al-Dulaimi to see more closely the difficult conditions under which people were living in various parts of the country. It made her especially aware of the conditions and plight of Iraqi women. This experience led her to write a booklet entitled "The Iraqi Woman".
She attempted to revive the Association of Iraqi Women and, supported by dozens of women activists, applied to the authorities to set up a 'Women’s Liberation Society'. But her application was rejected "based on public interest requirements"! In response, the signatories led by Dr, Naziha, decided to go ahead and set up this organization anyway, though clandestinely, after changing its name to the League for Defending Iraqi Woman’s Rights. The League thus came into being on 10 March 1952. Among the League’s objectives were:
Under the leadership and active participation of Dr Naziha the League (its name was subsequently changed to Iraqi Women’s League) developed during the following years and turned into a mass organization after the 14 July 1958 Revolution. With its membership rising to 42,000 (out of a total population at the time of 8 million), it achieved many gains for Iraqi women, in particular the progressive Personal Status Law No. 188 (1959).
In appreciation of its role and achievements, the Iraqi Women’s League became a permanent member of the Secretariat of the International Women’s Federation. Dr Naziha was elected to the Federation’s assembly and executive, and later became a vice-president of this international organization. She became a prominent women figure on an international level, as well as in the Arab world and “Third World.”
During the 1950s, Dr Naziha was an active participant in the Iraqi Peace Movement, and was a member of the preparatory committee for the Peace Partisans conference that was held in Baghdad on 25 July 1954. She was also a member of the World Peace Council.
She spent the 1950s researching and eradicating the indigenous Bejel bacteria in southern Iraq.
After the monarchy was overthrown, she was picked by President Abd al-Karim Qasim as Minister of Municipalities in the 1959 cabinet as the sole representative of the ICP in his republican government. She was the first woman minister in Iraq’s modern history, and the first woman cabinet minister in the Arab world. She later assumed the post of State Minister in a later cabinet formation.
During her government career, al-Dulaimi was instrumental in turning the vast slums of eastern Baghdad into a massive public works and housing project that came to be known as Thawra (Revolution) City—now Sadr City. She also helped author the secular 1959 Civil Affairs Law, which was way ahead of its time in liberalizing marriage and inheritance laws to the advantage of Iraqi women.
As a result of her multi-faceted activities in the Communist Party and the patriotic movement, Dr Naziha suffered considerable harassment and repression at various periods. She was forced to leave the country and go into exile several times. But this did not stop her from joining her comrades in the party and patriotic movement, and her sisters in the women’s movement, in the struggle for women’s legitimate and democratic rights.
Dr. Naziha was a true communist fighter, and a dedicated and reliable party cadre. She thus occupied a leading position in the party and became a member of its Central Committee. In the late 1970s, when the ruling dictatorial clique was preparing to launch its treacherous bloody campaign against the Iraqi Communist Party, she was a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee.
Throughout the years of her forced exile, she was totally and emotionally attached to her people and homeland and to their just cause. It is in this context that she played a prominent role in the leadership of the Committee for the Defense of the Iraqi People, set up after the fascist coup on 8 February 1963. The Committee was headed by the Iraqi poet Muhammad Mahdi Al-Jawahiri. Even during the 1990s, when she was old and frail, she did not cease her work in the women’s movement, particularly in the Iraqi Women’s League. The last important event in which she was actively involved was a seminar on the situation of Iraqi women, held in 1999 in Cologne, Germany.
She participated in preparations for the 5th Congress of the Iraqi Women’s League, but before it was convened (in March 2002) she suffered a stroke that effectively paralyzed her.
The passing away of the prominent comrade, Dr Naziha al-Dulaimi, is indeed an enormous loss for Communists and all Iraqi patriots. Her memory will continue to shine in the hearts of her comrades and all our Iraqi people, women and men, forever!
She died on 9 October 2007 in Herdecke at the age of 84, after battling the effects of a debilitating stroke for several years. She is survived by her brother Hisham al-Delaimi who is currently in the United States of America and a number of nephews and nieces scattered between Iraq, Lebanon, Germany, England and USA, the eldest being Dr. Layth al-Delaimy

Detroit Copper Mining Company of Arizona

The Detroit Copper Mining Company of Arizona was an American copper mining and smelting company based in Morenci, Arizona. Incorporated in 1874, it existed as an independent company until 1881 when a controlling interest in the company was purchased by the Phelps Dodge Corporation. It continued to exist as a subsidiary of Phelps Dodge until 1917, when all Phelps Dodge operations in the area were consolidated into the new Phelps Dodge, Morenci Branch.
History.
The company was co-founded in 1874 by Captain E. B. Ward, a wealthy steamboat owner from Detroit, Michigan, and William Church, a mine speculator from Denver, Colorado. Actual mining operations did not begin until 1875, however. The company consisted of 145 mining claims near Morenci. In time, the company owned a large store, a hotel, and considerable amounts of additional property in the town of Morenci. It also established a water pumping plant on the San Francisco River seven miles away. The quality of the "Detroit lode" yielded about 140 pounds of copper per ton of ore mined. But traditional mechanical concentration methods could not be used to process the ore; a furnace had to be used, increasing the cost of the operation and limiting the company's profitability until such time as it could raise enough capital to expand its smelting operations. Luckily, Detroit Copper Mining was the only company of any size to operate in the area until 1900.
Church founded the town of Morenci to supply housing and services to workers employed by the new mine. The company employed mostly Mexican miners, who were paid about half what Caucasian miners earned. As mining operations expanded, the town of Clifton was settled to provide additional housing.
The Phelps Dodge Corporation purchased a controlling interest in the company in 1881.
In May 1882, the company agreed to co-develop the "Detroit lode" with the Longfellow Copper Mining Company (later purchased by the Arizona Copper Company). Although federal and state law provided that the company which accessed the lode at a shallower level had the right to develop the entire deposit, Detroit Copper lacked the capital to do so and agreed to permit Longfellow Copper to mine the lode as well.
As with many mines in Arizona and New Mexico at the time, the Detroit Copper Mining Co. saw several waves of labor union organizing as well as strikes from 1900 onward. Detroit Mining used labor spies to infiltrate nascent unions and stop organizing campaigns.
Phelps Dodge Corporation bought out all remaining minority partners in 1897.
After a 1917 reorganization, the company ceased to exist. The operation was known as "Phelps Dodge Corporation, Morenci Branch."

Tumuk Humak Mountains

The Tumuk Humak Mountains (, , ) are a mountain range in South America, stretching about east–west in the border area between Brazil in the south, Suriname and French Guiana in the north. In the language of the Apalam and Wayana peoples, "Tumucumaque" means "the mountain rock symbolizing the struggle between the shaman and the spirits". The range is very remote and almost inaccessible.
Both the Maroni and Oyapock rivers originate in the Tumuk Humak Mountains. The Maroni () forms the entire (disputed) border between Suriname and French Guiana, and the Oyapock () most of the border between French Guiana and Brazil.
The Tumuk Humak Mountains are part of the Tumucumaque Uplands of the Guiana Shield. They are geographically important because they form the divide between the biogeographical system of the Amazon Basin and that of the Atlantic coastal area of the Guianas. The Tumuk Humak plateau is covered primarily with lowland and plateau forests.
Brazil's Tumucumaque National Park is named after the Tumuk Humak Mountains and covers that country's section of the mountain range, in the states of Pará and Amapá. It is Brazil's largest national park and the world's largest protected tropical forest. The highest point in the state of Amapá is located there, reaching 701 meters (2,300 ft).
The French film "Tumuc Humac" (1970), directed by Jean-Marie Périer, was named after the mountain range.

Union F.C.

The Union Football Club Manila or Union Internacional Manila F.C. is a Filipino football club based in Manila. It was established in 1996. The club currently plays for second division of the United Football League.
The club made its first appearance in the second season of the UFL playing in division two. The club ended their league campaign in fifth place behind division winner Manila Nomads.
History.
Foundation and early years.
The origin of Union FC is clearly associated to the Spanish company Union Fenosa (Soluziona).
In 1996 the company brought several consultants to lead the different projects it was engaging. Most of these consultants were from Spain, Uruguay, and also from Venezuela and Peru. Countries with long history and great passion for football.
Immediately they organized regular informal games at the JOLLY... field inside Meralco compound. This field was originally a baseball pitch, so it was reconditioned to suit football demand. Even the goals, in a country where it seemed that football did not exist, were specially made for the team by the electric company smiths!
Union Fenosa official debut was in 1997 against the Philippines National Football Team. The girls (did we mention that it was the Female National Team?) were not rival for the tough and dirty Union players! It was a milestone in Union’s history. By this time, the indisputable leader and coach was the Venezuelan Jose Lupo.
From there, every week, more and more people came to play to Jolly and joined the team. One of the most active recruiter was the Chilean Francisco “Trompeta” Devia, who did a great job recruiting players among the Foreign Diplomat Corp accredited in Philippines. The group grew up in quality and quantity.
Through the years Union joined almost all football tournaments or events where there was a round ball to be kicked: futsal, 7 aside, beach soccer and of course, 11 aside games. By September 2000, Union Fenosa became Union F.C. when it joined the Ateneo Football Tournament, losing the word “Fenosa” because most of the players were not related to the original company, and at the same time reflected better the spirit of the team, composed by people from all the corners of the world.
Through all these years, more than 33 nationalities (Argentina, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, Uruguay, USA, and Venezuela) and hundred of litres of beers had passed through the club!
In 2003, after the return of Jose Lupo to Spain, the Uruguayan Esteban Alonso took control of the team as Manager and Coach. The last man standing, Esteban Alonso, returned to Uruguay in December 2005, and left the responsibility of coaching to Dominic Samson, the first Pinoy coach of Union. During Samson’s era, several top players of Philippines reinforced Union’s squad, helping bringing two UFL Championships (2006 and 2007). Rafa Rodriguez and Jorge took over in late 2007, and have carried the club to a successful finish in the LBC-UFL 2010, ending in the podium finish behind Air force and Kaya FC.
Present and future.
After Dominic quit the management of Union for his family, Rafael Rodriguez took the responsibility of managing the team. During this period he put the whole team under his shoulders, kept it alive, and managed to keep the results within an acceptable level despite the lack of national players in the team. During 2010 more managerial help came through Ricky Pe and Jorge Müller. Since the semi-professionalization of the UFL under the administration of Football Alliance, the team also has been under pressure to professionalize its management and team. Negotiations during mid 2010 were carried out with Charlie Cojuangco, and it was agreed to form two teams: one on professional regime, and another on social-recreational regime.
We expect that the first team reaches the best performances in Philippine football, and the second team (UIM) keeps the spirit of the original UNION FC.
Records.
Note: Performances of the club indicated here was after the UFL Division 1 created (as a semi-pro league) in 2009.

The Marzipan Pig

The Marzipan Pig (1986, ISBN 0-374-34859-6) is a children's book by Russell Hoban. The plot involves a marzipan pig that has somehow fallen behind a couch. The pig laments being forgotten and as dust begins to cover him, he remains hopeful about someone discovering him. When he is eventually found (and eaten) by a mouse, parts of his personality are transferred to the mouse. The mouse in turn, falls in love with a nearby grandfather clock and comes to visit each night. The clock, of course, cannot reciprocate the mouse's love. One night the mouse leaves never to come back. The clock suddenly feels the loss of her, and desperately awaits her return, finally knowing both tight loneliness and cold emptiness. She does not come back and when he is next wound up, his spring breaks.
The mouse, unbeknownst to the clock, had been eaten by an owl outside. The owl falls in love with a lighted taxi meter and dances for rides. Where the mouse was eaten, a little pink flower grows up. A bee drinks the nectar, and then sleeps late, the next night showing affection to a dying hibiscus flower. A rather snooty white mouse thinks she'd be better at being a hibiscus and uses the dead petals of the hibiscus to make a dress, she then tries to hang on the plant, but it makes her fall outside, into a postman's bag, then is thrown right into the owl, and then ran into the house, she found in a package a new marzipan pig is delivered to the house - one without any knowledge of love or loneliness. The mouse eats the new marzipan pig, however, she fell asleep, the little boy who lived in the house opened the package (the day was his birthday) and found the mouse, the mouse then ran back into the mouse hole. The boy told his mother that he saw a mouse in a pink dress, though his mother never believed him. The mouse is not eaten by the owl. The mouse instead dances outside in the moonlight.
The story has been adapted in an animated version, produced and directed by Michael Sporn. The adaptation was animated by Tissa David and narrated by Tim Curry. It was aired on HBO as part of their "HBO Storybook Musicals" series.

Seán McCool (Irish: Seán MacCumhaill) (died 1 May 1949) was a prominent Irish Republican and a former chief of staff of the Irish Republican Army. Imprisoned on numerous occasions, both North and South of the border, he embarked on a number of hunger strikes. He stood as a candidate for Clann na Poblachta before leaving the party as a result of their decision to go into government with Fine Gael.
McCool was described by Peadar O’Donnell as "...deeply read but very much the IRA man". He was also prominent within the GAA in his native County Donegal and the current home ground of the Donegal GAA, MacCumhaill Park, is named in his honour.
Early IRA activity.
McCool, based in Donegal, took the Republican side during the Irish Civil War. At the end of the War he was sentenced and held as a prisoner of the Free State in either Finner Camp or Drumboe Castle.
McCool was present at the 2nd Drumboe martyrs commemoration for the execution of IRA volunteers Lieut. Dan Enright, Comdt. Gen. Charlie Daly, Brig. Comdt. Sean Larkin, and Lieut. Timothy O’Sullivan in 1923.
Land annuities campaign.
By 1927 Peadar O’Donnell, the IRA leader, had begun a campaign to use social agitation on the issue of Land Annuities, where small farmers in the republic were being taxed to pay for land brought by the British government in the preceding century. McCool was one of O’Donnell’s earliest supporters and by now was in charge of the East Donegal IRA.
In September 1926 McCool’s IRA unit raided the offices of a landlord’s agent in Donegal, taking away all records. On 19 February 1927 he was one of four men arrested in connection with the raid. Before the trial, the prisoners went on hunger strike for a week. McCool, and his co-accused, which included Peadar O’Donnell’s younger brother Barney, received a sentence of six months imprisonment. which McCool served in Mountjoy Prison where he would have been a prisoner at the same time as Seán MacBride
Upon his release McCool returned to IRA activity in Donegal and was the main speaker at the annual Drumboe commemoration in 1928. His period of freedom was not to last as, by May 1929, he was again arrested in Sligo and held on a ‘documents’ charge while engaged in land annuity agitation. He was later sentenced to eight months of imprisonment.
Rebuilding the IRA.
During the 1930s senior IRA officers and veterans of the Tan and Civil Wars such as McCool were sent to different areas for weeks at a time to help train local IRA recruits.
In 1931, despite not being a member of the party, Fianna Fáil members in Stranorlar, Co. Donegal attempted to select McCool as candidate, without success. That same year the IRA attempted to launch its own political party, Saor Éire. McCool attended the inaugural meeting and seconded a motion sending fraternal greetings to the USSR. The success Fianna Fáil and the IRA at this time encouraged McCool, writing to fellow republican Frank Ryan in 1932 he said that the crowd (at the Drumboe march) "did one’s heart good after all the black years... the youth are with us and that’s everything".
McCool continued to be active on both the military and political fronts. In 1932 he joined Peadar O’Donnell, Charlotte Despard and David Fitzgerald on the governing Committee of the Workers College, a group close to the Revolutionary Workers Group which would later morph into the Communist Party of Ireland. Later that year, while still involved in training activities, an IRA unit under the command of McCool and Mick Price took over Donamon Castle in County Roscommon to set up a training camp. He also found time to address the Drumboe commemoration in his native County Donegal. McCool wrote to then IRA Chief of Staff Moss Twomey requesting permission to issue a statement, ahead of a planned Orange march in Donegal, denouncing imperialist displays. This plan was vetoed by Twomey and Peadar O’Donnell’s appeal to the Orange Order was issued instead.
By 1933 McCool was commander of the IRA Donegal No.2 Battalion and presided over the organising of a new slua of na Fianna Éireann (IRA youth wing) in Letterkenny, Co. Donegal and attended a ‘Release the Prisoners’ meeting in Derry City. He was also selected to stand as an abstentionist Republican candidate for the Foyle Constituency in Derry where he received 3,031 votes. This result, along with the votes obtained by other Republicans in the North was hailed as significant with the IRA proclaiming ‘the fight in the North has been given new life’.
The early 1930s saw increasing clashes between the IRA and the General Eoin O’Duffy’s Blueshirts, At the 1934 IRA General Army Convention differences began to arise between those who thought that fighting Irish fascism in the form of the Blueshirts was the most important task for the IRA and those who believed that the Fianna Fáil government was using these clashes to turn against, and clamp down on the IRA. At the convention McCool warned against physical clashes with the blueshirts, stating that the IRA should instead attack what they stood for.
1934 saw the IRA split, with many on the left such as McCool’s longtime ally Peadar O’Donnell leaving to form the Republican Congress and being dismissed from the IRA. This split was initially amicable with each side retaining many friends within each organisation.
Despite being on the left of the IRA McCool remained loyal and did not join those who left to form the Republican Congress and again spoke at the Drumboe Commemoration in 1935.
The Crown Entry Affair.
25 April 1936 saw the IRA convene a court martial in Belfast. The venue for the court martial was the Craobh Ruadh Club at 10 Crown Entry. Presiding over the court martial was members of the IRA's GHQ staff and the Ulster leadership of IRA which by now included Seán McCool.
At 3:25pm, the RUC raided the club and arrested all present. Those present were charged with Treason-Felony and refused to recognise the court. McCool was sentenced to five years imprisonment which he served in Belfast's Crumlin Road Gaol. By September 1936 McCool and Jim Killeen (Adjutant General before being arrested in the Craobh Ruadh Club) were on hunger strike for political status.
Chief of Staff.
Upon release after serving his 5-year sentence in Belfast McCool returned to the Twenty-Six Counties and was quickly arrested by the Gardaí with the intention of interning him. Representations were made to the Justice Minister, Gerard Boland, that since McCool had only been released from prison in Belfast that he should not be interned as he had effectively not been active and there was no evidence that he was a threat. Boland, contrary to the advice of the Gardaí, ordered his release.
November 1941 saw the arrest of IRA chief of Staff Pearse Kelly and a hurried IRA conference was called to deal with the vacancy. Seán Harrington was appointed Chief of Staff while the newly released Seán McCool took on the role of Adjutant-General. The Dublin government had the IRA on the run for a number of years now and this was the first time in almost a year that the IRA had a functioning GHQ staff. The IRA's previous strategy, advocated by Seán Russell, of focusing its activities on England had been a failure. The new leadership turned its focus to the six north eastern Counties which remained under British jurisdiction, while attempting to curtail armed actions by the IRA in the Twenty-Six Counties which had given the Dublin government justification to clamp down on the IRA.
However, it wasn't long before Harrington was arrested and the Chief of Staff position was again vacant. The IRA in the Twenty-Six Counties was in disarray and the leadership was severely depleted. The Northern Command of the IRA saw this and stepped into the void, effectively assuming control of the organisation, with some justification given that the focus of the IRA was to be the North of Ireland.
GHQ had become a mere symbol. February 1942 saw Seán McCool take on the role of Chief of Staff while Belfast's Eoin McNamee became Adjutant-General. McCool, McNamee and one or two others were the sum total of the IRA leadership and GHQ staff.
The process of rebuilding the IRA was difficult. With so many arrests contacts had been lost or disappeared. McCool traveled around the country attempting the re-establish IRA units and working towards the planned Northern campaign. McCool and McNamee worked tirelessly and even attempted to renew contacts with Germany ahead of the planned campaign in the North.
Attempts to re-establish contact with Germany gathered pace when German Sergeant Gunther Schuetz escaped from Mountjoy Gaol in February 1942 and made contact with the IRA. Schuetz made contact with Mrs Caítlín Brugha (widow of Cathal Brugha) and McCool quickly developed plans to get Schuetz out of the country with a shopping list of weapons for the IRA.
McCool, however, was not to see these plans develop as August 1942 saw him arrested and interned in the Curragh despite being an election candidate for the Irish General Election scheduled for June 1943. McCool's arrest caused difficulties for the IRA for while he had done an impressive job as Chief of Staff in a short period of time, he had kept the locations and contents of many IRA arms dumps in his head. McCool, however, developed a plan to get this information to his comrades on the outside who were still planning for the Northern Campaign.
Republican internees held in the Curragh camp had split into two main factions. However, a third faction of those who refused to take sides was also in existence. One member of this non-aligned faction was Harry White. McCool hoped that White would appear to the authorities as having become disillusioned with the IRA due to the splits in the camp. With this is mind McCool selected White to become his courier. McCool asked White to 'sign out' of the camp and take the details of the arms dumps which McCool had to the IRA leadership on the outside. 'Signing out' meant giving an undertaking to the authorities that you would turn you back on the IRA and not re-engage in the Republican struggle. This was contrary to IRA rules and carried a great stigma with it. White initially refused as he did not wish to contravene IRA rules. McCool circumvented this problem by getting White to resign from the IRA, then sign out and rejoin when he left the camp. Technically this would mean that White was not breaking any IRA orders. The plan succeeded and, through White, McCool's information was relayed to the IRA on the outside. McCool used this method of getting men to 'sign out' to get other experienced IRA Volunteers out of the Curragh in order to help the IRA on the outside.
The Curragh.
When McCool arrived in the Curragh internment camp in April 1942 the faction fighting within the camp between those who accepted Liam Leddy as the prisoners camp O/C and those who supported Pearse Kelly as camp O/C was in full flight. McCool, upon entering the Curragh, brought instructions from the IRA leadership on the outside that the rift between the factions was to be healed and both factions were to come together. Liam Leddy organised a meeting within the camp to discuss the directive from the leadership. McCool and a number of other prisoners, mostly on the Kelly side of the dispute, voted to accept the directive. Leddy refused to accept this and the split was solidified and McCool aligned himself with the Pearse Kelly faction.
While morale amongst the prisoners was affected by the split in the camp McCool and other senior prisoners in the camp ensured that men were kept occupied and that Republican politics was to the fore at all times. Towards the end of 1942 this took the form of a 'Statement on Republican Policy'. McCool and Pearse Kelly colluded in writing this document which was essentially an education program for Republican internees which was intended to ensure that the Curragh Camp became "..a school of training of leaders and fighters". The document focused on revolutionary training, the national struggle, the history and economics. This was a radical program which put the common good ahead of private property rights, called for large unproductive landholding to be redistributed, planned for surplus farm produce to be sold at a price guaranteed by the State and promoted State banks and co-ops among other radical social and economic proposals. One internee, Derry Kelleher, noted that this period in the Curragh was where "I first heard the word 'revolution' in the powerful northern accent of Seán MacCumhaill".
Despite the inconvenience of his imprisonment, McCool still had an election to fight as the Republican candidate in his native Donegal. The arrest and internment of an election candidate caused some controversy. Speaking in Leinster House, seat of the Irish Oireachtas, Roddy Connolly (veteran of the Tan War and Civil War, Labour Party T.D. and son of James Connolly) raised McCool's plight when discussing the effects that censorship implemented by the Fianna Fáil government were having on McCool's election campaign, namely that the Fianna Fáil government had censored one of McCool's election advertisements.
During the same debate Connolly also accused the Fianna Fáil government of abusing the powers of internment by arresting a candidate for parliamentary election, effectively depriving him of being able to contact his constituents during the election campaign.
On top of this McCool had, in May 1943, begun a Hunger Strike. McCool's hunger strike demanding release or fair trial began on 22 May 1943. The public was not notified by the Dublin authorities until 18 June 1943 that McCool was on hunger strike and, due to the censorship in place at the time his election literature was not allowed to refer to this issue. By July 1943 the issue if those on Hunger Strike in the Curragh was the subject of debate in the Dublin Parliament and a number of demands were made for their release.
Despite the censorship in place, which meant that only McCool's name and Party appeared on the ballot paper with little or no media coverage of his policies or plight, he polled 1,961 votes in the Donegal East constituency. McCool's hunger strike ended on 11 July 1943, after 50 days when he and three other hunger strikers, John Gerard O'Doherty, Terry McLaughlin and John Joe Maxwell, were persuaded to come off it by Sean MacBride and Con Lehane.
Undoubtedly, the prolonged hunger strike had effects on the health of McCool, an issue which was again raised in the Dublin parliament on 30 November 1944 where one TD alleged that the doctor in the Curragh was refusing to tend to McCool and that McCool's health was in an extremely poor way
After Internment.
By 1945 most of the Republican internees who had been held in the Curragh were released. By this stage the IRA was almost non-existent. Internment had robbed it of its most talented leaders and the factional disputes that had taken place in the Curragh had disillusioned most of those who had been interned. Within this context Republicans slowly began trying to rebuild the IRA. This was no easy task as whole units had lost contact with the leadership, arms dumps were lost and forgotten about. Indeed, many were unsure who was actually still in the IRA.
The first major Republican gathering which took place after the 'Curragh Years' was the annual Bodenstown commemoration in June 1945. There, among the assembled crowd McCool met with Tony Magan and Michael Conway. All three agreed that they should work to begin rebuilding what was left of the IRA. However, by July 1945 he was again arrested and charged with plotting to kill Seán Gantly, head of the Free State Special Branch. Gantly, who had taken the Free State side after the Treaty split, had become the nemesis of many senior IRA members after carrying out a number of high profile arrests against them.
By 1946 serious efforts were being made to re-establish the IRA leadership. In May 1947 Garda Special Branch were monitoring meetings held to establish a new republican national newspaper. These meetings were held under the banner of the 'Sean McCaughey Sinn Féin Cumann'. It was believed at that time that the IRA was using the cover of Sinn Féin to reorganise. A further meeting was held in June 1947 to discuss the reissue of An Phoblacht. McCool attended this meeting, during which the current state of the IRA was also discussed. This meeting, however, was noted for the argument which took place between Paddy McLogan and Seán McCool. McLogan had suggested that the IRA give up the idea of drilling among other things. Many delegated seized upon this as an opportunity to expound the necessity of physical force, the foremost of these being McCool. It was noted that the meeting ended without any firm proposals and that McLogan and McCool parted on bad terms.
The reorganisation of the IRA had seen the election of a new leadership which was primarily composed of those who had opposed McCool and Pearse Kelly in the Curragh and also contained Paddy McLogan.
Clann na Poblachta.
In July 1946 former IRA chief of staff and good friend of Seán McCool, Seán MacBride, formed a new political party called Clann na Poblachta. The Clann drew many well known and staunch IRA and former IRA members such as MacBride, Con Lehane, Jim Killeen, Michael Conway and Mick Fitzpatrick, and also attracted a number of younger radical members who had no Republican history or background.
By 1947 the Clann had won two by-elections and their campaigning had given hope to many Republicans who had become demoralised by a combination of the Curragh splits, the Stephen Hayes affair, and the lack of political direction within the IRA. Added to this was the fact that many voters felt that Fianna Fáil had failed to live up to their early promise, this was exacerbated by Taoiseach de Valera's government being content to let IRA men die on hunger strike, particularly Sean McCaughey in Irish prisons.
The Clann once again put Republicanism centre stage and many Republican stalwarts, McCool, included were swept up by this tide and the belief that MacBride and the Clann might just go all the way and achieve what Fianna Fáil and the IRA has thus far failed to do.
1948 saw a general election in the Free State, one which Clann na Poblachta, spurred on by their by-election victories, presented a serious challenge to Fianna Fáil. McCool, now a member of the Clann, stood as a candidate in his home Donegal East constituency and increased his previous vote by receiving 3,217 votes. While McCool did not manage to win a seat, the overall Clann na Poblachta vote meant that the party held the balance of power in the Twenty-Six counties.
The decision was made to enter into coalition government with Fine Gael. This decision to go into government as partners with the tradition enemy of republicanism was a step too far for many Republicans within the Clann and Seán McCool was probably one of the most prominent members to resign from the party on this issue.
Involvement in the GAA and death.
The GAA had a strong tradition in the Stranorlar/Ballybofey area dating back to 1916 when the team 'Ballybofey Éire Óg's' was formed in Ballybofey and the in 1917 when 'Stranorlar Sarsfield's' was formed. Both teams then came together to form 'Erin's Hope'. In 1944, Ben Griffin and Sean MacCumhaill made an offer to Mark Byrne to buy a field which was within the town boundary of Ballybofey, but at the time the owner was unwilling to sell. In 1946, as part of the 'Civic Week' celebrations in the Twin Towns a friendly match between Sligo and Donegal was held in Mark Byrne's field. As this proved to be a great success, a Park Committee was formed and the field was finally secured for the GAA. McCool also served as secretary of the Donegal GAA from 1946 until his death in 1949.
McCool died suddenly on 1 May 1949, shortly after Mark Byrne's field was secured for the GAA. Soon after that it was decided that the new Park would be known as Seán MacCumhaill Park, in honour of Seán McCool. On Sunday, 22 April 1956, the well equipped MacCumhaill Park was officially opened by the President of the GAA, and a plaque to the memory of the late Seán MacCumhaill was unveiled at the main gate. The name of the Club was also changed from "Erin's Hope" to "Sean MacCumhaills", a name it retains to this day.
The crowds attending McCool's funeral packed the streets of Stranorlar. After the funeral service, his tricolour draped coffin was borne through Stranorlar to the old graveyard. "Seán MacCumhaill was an extraordinary man" said Fr. Gallagher at the funeral, "he never once flinched from the ideals he had set for himself, he was an honest, God fearing Irishman."

Xylotomy

Xylotomy is the preparation of small slivers of wood for examination under a microscope, often using a microtome.
It is useful for providing forensic evidence in some criminal cases where finding a fragment of wood on an individual and matching it to a weapon used in a crime would be helpful. One xylotomist, Arthur Koehler, was able to provide crucial evidence by linking a piece of pine from a ladder used in a kidnapping to one particular factory whose machinery was defective, and from there to one particular lumberyard. Koehler searched for eighteen months for the yard, and presented his evidence dramatically in court by presenting the court with a chalk rubbing of the samples, which he made there and then, demonstrating that they were identical. He also matched other pieces of the ladder to a chisel used to create the joists, missing from the defendant's tool chest, and to a missing plank from the suspect's attic floor.
It may also be useful in forestry studies. Identifying the species of a piece of wood is not always easy, in which case a xylotheque may provide samples with which the xylotomist can compare his own. Xylotomy may be carried out by a forensic biologist. People who specialize in xylotomy are difficult to obtain. The public have been known to confuse it with someone who plays the xylophone and they do not tend to take much interest in the subject.

Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate or docusate sodium (INN, ) – often referred to as DSS, Aerosol OT or AOT – is a common ingredient in consumer products, especially laxatives of the stool softener type. It is also used as an emulsifying, wetting, and dispersing agent, as a pesticide, as well as a component of the oil dispersant Corexit which was used in the "Deepwater Horizon" oil spill of 2010. It is an anionic surfactant, a substance that lowers the surface tension of water.
Docusate calcium and docusate potassium, as well as other dioctyl sulfosuccinate salts, are also widely used in the same areas.
Uses.
Clinical use.
Docusate is used to make stools softer and easier to pass. It is used in symptomatic treatment of constipation, and in painful anorectal conditions such as hemorrhoids and anal fissures for people avoiding straining during bowel movements. Patients taking docusate should drink plenty of water to irrigate the bowel, thereby increasing motility. Given orally, the effects are usually seen 1 to 3 days after the first dose. Given rectally, as an enema or suppository, a bowel movement usually occurs within 5 to 20 minutes.
The drug may be used in people who are undergoing opioid pain therapy, are opioid dependent, or on opioid replacement therapy, though prolonged use may cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting its efficacy in treating chronic constipation is lacking.
Available forms.
Docusate sodium is administered orally or rectally; in tablets, capsules, suppositories and enemas. It is also used as an emulsifier and dispersant in topical preparations.
Contraindications.
Docusate is contraindicated in patients with appendicitis, acute abdomen or ileus. It is not suitable for the treatment of chronic constipation.
Side effects.
Possible side effects are typically mild and include stomach pain, diarrhea, or cramping. Serious allergic reactions can occur with the drug. The most severe side effect of docusate, although very rare, is rectal bleeding.
Physical and chemical properties.
Solubility of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate in water is 1:70 (14 g/l) at 25 °C, increasing to 1:20 at 70 °C. Solubility is better in less polar solvents: 1:30 in ethanol, 1:1 in chloroform and diethylether, and practically unlimited in petroleum ether (25 °C). It is also highly soluble in glycerol, although this is a rather polar solvent.
The ester groups are easily cleaved under basic conditions, but are stable against acids.
Pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action.
Docusate does not stay in the gastrointestinal tract, but is absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted via the gallbladder after undergoing extensive metabolism.
The effect of docusate may not necessarily be all due to its surfactant properties. Perfusion studies suggest that docusate inhibits fluid absorption or stimulates secretion in the portion of the small intestine known as the jejunum.
Interactions.
Docusate should not be used in addition to mineral oil as the emulsifier will result in mineral oil being absorbed rather than functioning as a lubricant for the bowel walls, possibly resulting in foreign body granulomas. The substance might also increase resorption of other drugs, for example dantron (1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone).
Toxicity.
Toxicity for different species varies widely, but dioctyl sulfosuccinate biodegrades quickly in soil and water, a typical finding being >90% in 12 to 17 days. In the atmosphere, it is destroyed by a photochemical reaction with an estimated half-life of 18 hours.
In humans.
Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate is a strong irritant for eyes and lungs, and also a skin irritant. Ingestion can cause the side effects described above, such as diarrhea, intestinal bloating and occasionally cramping pains. DSS is not known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic.
In marine species.
Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate has been determined to be of low toxicity for crustaceans like the hermit crab "Clibanarius erythropus" and the shrimp "Crangon crangon". The median lethal dose (LD50) for these species is about 100 mg/l of a docusate containing formulation after 48 hours of exposition, although the concentration of the formulation is not specified in the study.
Toxicity for molluscs varies widely, with 48-hour LD50 found between 5 mg/l for the common limpet and 100 mg/l for the common periwinkle. Various species of phytoplankton have an LD50 of around 8 mg/l. All of these doses refer to the mentioned formulation, not the pure chemical.
In a 2010 study, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate exhibited higher toxicity against bacteria ("Vibrio fischeri", "Anabaena sp.") and algae ("Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata") than a number of fluorinated surfactants (PFOS, PFOA, PFBS). Measuring bioluminescence inhibition of the bacteria and growth inhibition of the algae, the ED50 were in the range of 43–75 mg/l. Combinations of the fluorinated compounds with DSS showed mid to highly synergistic effects in most settings, meaning that such combinations are significantly more toxic than the individual substances.
In freshwater species.
The substance is highly toxic for rainbow trout with a median lethal concentration (LC50) of 0.56 mg/l after 48 hours for the pure substance. It is only slightly to moderately toxic for rainbow trout fingerlings, and slightly toxic for harlequin rasboras (LC50 27 mg/l of a 60% formulation after 48 hours).

History.
One of the most influential and early examples of "uta monogatari" is the "Tales of Ise". An anonymous work sometimes attributed to Ariwara no Narihira, it is a series of 125 largely unconnected prose narratives about "a man", many of said narratives beginning with the short sentence "Mukashi otoko arikeri" (Long ago, there was a man). These narratives are largely centered around poetry composed by the "man", usually identified as a fictionalized version of Narihira.
The name "uta monogatari" was first applied to the sub-genre during the Meiji period.

15 cm L/40 Feldkanone i.R.

The 15 cm Feldkanone L/40 in Räderlafette (40 caliber Field Gun on Wheeled Carriage) was a heavy field gun used by Germany in World War I. It was an ex-naval gun hastily adapted for land service by rigidly mounting it in a field carriage.
History.
The Germans were desperate for long-range artillery by 1915 and were forced to adapt a number of ex-naval guns for Army use, details of which are often lacking. The "SK L/40 (Schnellladungskanone or fast-loading cannon)" was an obsolete gun that was used as the secondary armament by pre-dreadnought battleships. It seems that there were actually two versions of this gun, one with an L/40 and the other with an L/45 barrel. It is not known if the designation changed depending on the barrel. The gun could not traverse on the mount and had to be fixed on a firing platform that weighed to give it 60° of traverse. For transport purposes, it was broken down into three loads; barrel, carriage and firing platform.
While details are unclear, it seems that this gun was also adapted for land use, complete with its armored gunhouse, as the "15 cm KiSL (Kanone in Schirmlafette)". It was mounted on a central pivot, which was in turn mounted on a firing platform. It was transported by rail or by road to its firing location in one piece and then offloaded onto the firing platform by crane.
It retained the Navy's (Kaiserliche Marine) semi-fixed ammunition, where one bag of powder was loaded before the brass cartridge containing the rest of the propellant and the primer.

Washington Square, Pasadena, California

Washington Square is a neighborhood in Pasadena, California. It is bordered by Washington Boulevard to the north, Mountain Street to the south, El Molino Avenue to the west, and Lake Avenue to the west. It is notable for having been renamed several times, having been known as part of Orange Heights until the 1950s, then Clement Heights until the 1980s when it was shortened to CLEM, then Heather Heights until the late 1990s when it was given its current name. The neighborhood was built up gradually until the 1940s, when the last housing tract was built around Heather Square.
History.
The land that became Washington Square was a large open field that eventually got replaced by a patchwork of small olive and orange groves. The glen at the corner of Washington and El Molino was used as a municipal dump until 1922, when Theodore Payne reclaimed the land for a park (present-day Washington Park). This helped spur neighborhood development. By 1930, all but the Jonathan Tract (Heather Square) had been filled in. The west-central area of the neighborhood remained undeveloped until 1943.
Over the 1970s and 1980s, property values in the neighborhood plummeted. Gang violence and drug manufacturing became rampant, and historic buildings were demolished in favor of low-rent apartments and cheap shopping centers. The Great Recession followed a 20-year long wave of gentrification and the neighborhood quickly fell into disrepair, struggling with safety and vacancy.
To combat this issue, In 2003 residents joined together to form the Washington Square Neighborhood Association successfully reducing crime and establishing Washington Square as a historic Pasadena landmark district encompassing approximately 250 homes built mainly between 1910 and 1940. Architectural styles range from California Craftsman, Spanish Colonial, Tudor, English Cottage to Traditional. Streets are lined with old-growth Camphor, California Oak and Palm trees which not only add beauty to the neighborhood but also keeps homes cool during the warm California summers. All contributing properties are eligible for the Mills Act which gives homeowners a substantial real estate tax savings for maintaining their historic home.
Landmarks.
Washington Square is notable for having one of Pasadena's oldest parks, Washington Park, which was reclaimed from a municipal dump in 1922. Woodbury Creek also runs through the neighborhood, though most of the creek now runs underground. The neighborhood is also home to two of Pasadena's oldest standing houses, which date from the early 1890s, and the one-time home of author Upton Sinclair (it is believed that the house belonged to him during his run for Governor of California.
Education.
Washington Square is served by Marshall Secondary School, Longfellow Elementary School, Eliot Middle School, and Pasadena High School.
Transportation.
Washington Square is served by Metro Local lines 180, 268, and 485; as well as Pasadena ARTS route 20.

Tabitha's Secret

Tabitha's Secret was a band formed in March 1993 in Orlando, Florida. It was originally composed of lead vocalist Rob Thomas, John Goff, and Jay Stanley on guitar, Brian Yale on bass (Colin Christan was the original bass player), and Chris Smith playing drums. Brad Presa was the bands roadie. In September 1993, Paul Doucette joined the band as a second percussionist, only to replace Chris Smith entirely a year later. Some of the band's most popular songs were "And Around", "Dear Joan", "Unkind", "Forever December", "Paint Me Blue", and "3 A.M..".
History.
The Split.
In 1995 the band interviewed several managers and selected Kevin O'Malley, then manager of Spider Monkey, a regional band enjoying a great deal of success at the time, to represent them. O'Malley immediately connected the band with a publicist, agent Chris Tanner out of Nashville and several record company reps including Kim Stephens, a promotions and A&R rep for Atlantic Records. Kim Stephens brought the band's demo to Jason Flom, then President of Atlantic's Lava sub-label. O'Malley arranged a showcase at Potbelly's in Tallahassee, FL and Flom was sold on the band's material, which included the future hit 3AM. Kevin O'Malley's brother John, Jay Stanley and John Goff financed a new recording session in Atlanta which yielded recordings of new material (the songs Tired, and Swing) as well as refreshed versions of Forever December and 3AM.
Also that year, songwriter/producer and representative for Atlantic Records, Matt Serletic, approached the members of Tabitha's Secret concerning a long-term record deal with his production company, Melisma, which neither Jay Stanley nor John Goff were interested in, believing that it would be better to sign an album deal directly with the label and not with Serletic's company. However, Serletic pressed on with his desire to sign the band. It is commonly believed that Serletic was more interested in helping Thomas find his voice than he was in the band Tabitha's Secret. In spite of objections from Stanley, Rob Thomas decided to take the offer.
Stanley and Goff's refusal to sign a long-term production contract, along with alleged pressure from the record company to drop the two guitar players, convinced Thomas to leave the band and take the deal for himself. Stanley continued to operate Tabitha's Secret as a business, however, Goff signed over his interest in the Tabitha's Secret business to Stanley in 1998 and started his own company, separate from Stanley.
Serletic's own personal manager and accountant were installed to handle Thomas's affairs. Shortly after, Thomas, Yale, and Doucette signed a seven-record deal with Atlantic Records. Atlantic Records introduced the trio to two guitarists: Adam Gaynor (Serletic knew Adam from his time at Criterion Studios in South Florida with Collective Soul) and Kyle Cook (Serletic grew up two houses from Cook in Stone Mountain, Georgia). With Cook on lead guitar and Gaynor on rhythm guitar, the five formed the well-known band Matchbox Twenty.
The Lawsuit.
In 1997, guitarist Paul Stanley and bassist John Goff filed a lawsuit against three members of Matchbox 20, singer Rob Thomas, drummer Paul Doucette and bassist Brian Yale, along with producer Matt Serletic and attorney David Mantel. The lawsuit alleged that Serletic approached the band about a long term agreement and the production of a self-title/self-published EP, which included the track "3 A.M.," and then agreed to represent that band to Atlantic Records. No recording contract was obtained, and Thomas, Doucette and Yale later left the band to form Matchbox 20. The track "3 A.M." was later published on Matchbox 20's debut album "Yourself Or Someone Like You". Stanley and Goff sued Matchbox Twenty claiming fiduciary breach of contract and sued Serletic and his attorney for tortious interference. This lawsuit lasted five years and was settled out of court in 2000.
Recordings.
The first recording released by Tabitha's Secret was a self-titled and self-published EP featuring the name "Tabitha's Secret?" and original artwork by Perry Souza.
The first post-breakup Tabitha's Secret album was entitled "Don't Play With Matches" (a thinly-veiled reference to Stanley's ex-bandmates), released in 1998.
The next recording, in 2000, was entitled "Live", and features recordings from Tabitha's Secret's shows.
In 2001, Jay Stanley joined with Tony Miceli and George Spatta to re-mix, re-master and overdub the original recordings from the self-titled EP, much to Thomas's disapproval. Unfortunately for Thomas, the laws in the US state that any audio recording may be released providing the songwriter is provided royalties. Therefore, as long as Thomas receives payment as a contributor he has no legal standing to stop the release.
Thomas has been quoted as saying he is angry that Stanley is making a living from his past. 
Recently, Jay Stanley has begun to release new Tabitha's Secret material, entitled the "Vault". Currently, three releases are available, Vault(s) 1, 2 and 3.

Pneuma (Stoic)

In Stoic philosophy, pneuma (πνεῦμα) is the concept of the "breath of life," a mixture of the elements air (in motion) and fire (as warmth). Originating among Greek medical writers who locate human vitality in the breath, pneuma for the Stoics is the active, generative principle that organizes both the individual and the cosmos. In its highest form, the pneuma constitutes the human soul ("psychê"), which is a fragment of the pneuma that is the soul of God (Zeus). As a force that structures matter, it exists even in inanimate objects.
Levels of pneuma.
In the Stoic universe, everything is constituted of matter and pneuma. There are three grades or kinds of pneuma, depending on their proportion of fire and air.
A fourth grade of pneuma may also be distinguished. This is the rational soul ("logica psychê") of the mature human being, which grants the power of judgment.
Pneuma and cosmology.
In Stoic cosmology, everything that exists depends on two first principles which can be neither created nor destroyed: matter, which is passive and inert, and the "logos", or divine reason, which is active and organizing. The 3rd-century B.C. Stoic Chrysippus regarded pneuma as the vehicle of "logos" in structuring matter, both in animals and in the physical world. Pneuma in its purest form can thus be difficult to distinguish from "logos" or the "constructive fire" ("pur technikon") that drives the cyclical generation and destruction of the Stoic cosmos. When a cycle reaches its end in conflagration ("ekpyrôsis"), the cosmos becomes pure pneuma from which it regenerates itself.
The Stoics conceived of the cosmos as a whole and single entity, a living thing with a soul of its own, a spherical continuum of matter held together by the orderly power of Zeus through the causality of the pneuma that pervades it. This divine pneuma that is the soul of the cosmos supplies the pneuma in its varying grades for everything in the world.

<doc id="18923701" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18923701" title="Spiritwalker">
Spiritwalker

"Spiritwalker" is a single by the English rock band The Cult and was released on 4 April 1984. "Spiritwalker" is the lead single from the "Dreamtime" album, although it was released nearly five months before the album was released.
Song Origins.
"Spiritwalker" was written while the group was still Death Cult. It was never recorded by the group but was integrated into their set list during their second United Kingdom tour in late 1983. The song, musically, was much different, but, lyrically, it was nearly the same as the final recorded version.
The song has its origins with Ian Astbury's earlier group, The Southern Death Cult. On 29 October 1981, at the group's second live performance ever, The Southern Death Cult played Queen's Hall in Bradford, England. During their set they performed and untitled song (later referred to as "The War Song") that featured many of the same lyrics as "Spiritwalker". The song was never performed by The Southern Death Cult again.
Apparently Astbury incorporated the lyrics of "The War Song" into the creation of "Spiritwalker" but no credit was ever given to the other members of The Southern Death Cult, and it is unknown whether they contributed to the writing of the original version.
B-Side.
The B-side of the seven-inch single is a radio session of "A Flower In The Desert" recorded while the group was still Death Cult. The song, an acoustic version, was recorded for the David Jensen show on BBC Radio One and was engineered by Dale Griffin. The song was first broadcast on 27 October 1983. The song "A Flower In The Desert" is a re-written version of "Flowers In The Forest" originally recorded by Astbury's earlier group The Southern Death Cult. Thus the song is credited as Astbury/Jepson/Burroughs/Qureshi (the members of The Southern Death Cult). The song, along with the entire radio session, was later released on the compact disc collection of Death Cult recordings entitled "Ghost Dance".
The B-side to the twelve-inch single is also "A Flower In The Desert" along with the song "Bone Bag" (which was recorded during the "Dreamtime" album sessions). "Bone Bag" (often erroneously spelled "Bonebag") was later, in 1986, included on the first United Kingdom compact disc versions of the "Dreamtime" album (Beggars Banquet catalogue number BEGA 57CD) as a bonus track.
Music Video.
No "official" music video was recorded for the song "Spiritwalker". When the group released the music video collection "Pure Cult: The Singles 1984-1995" (the companion to the "" album) their live performance of "Spiritwalker" on The Tube was included in place of a "proper" music video. The performance is one of notoriety as it was broadcast live on 13 January 1984 (Friday the 13th of all days) and announcer Jools Holland introduced the group as ""...just now The Cult"". The group, prior to the performance, had decided to change its name from Death Cult to simply The Cult.

Harmonie Club (Detroit, Michigan)

The Harmonie Club is a club located at 267 East Grand River Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1975 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
History.
Augustus Woodward's plan for Detroit's streets created oddly-shaped triangular blocks, including Capitol Park on the west and Harmonie Park on the east. Starting in the 1830s and 40s, this area was home to a growing number of German immigrants to Detroit. In 1849, to preserve their ethnic traditions, a group of Detroit Germans founded a singing group, the "Gesang-Verein Harmonie". The club built a frame clubhouse at the corner of Lafayette and Beaubien in 1874. This frame Harmonie Club structure burned in 1893, and the club almost immediately organized a competition, open to German architects, to design a new building. Richard Raseman (the architect of the Grand Army of the Republic Building) won the competition; the resulting building sits across from Harmonie Park.
Architecture.
The Harmonie Club is a four-story, hipped-roof building with a basement, built of buff-colored brick and stone. The curved corner is particularly shaped to the geometry of the site. The first two stories are embellished with stonework, and the top two stories feature additional banding and arched windows on the top floor. Corinthian columns and a balustraded balcony over the entry add a classical feel. The interior of the club features classical plasterwork, dark oak paneling and Pewabic tile. The club also offered fine dining, a tavern, card rooms, bowling alley and lounges.
Current use.
Over time, membership in the Harmonie Club dwindled, and the club was sold in 1974. The building remained vacant until the 1990s; as of 2007, the city of Detroit planned a cultural district around Harmonie Park, to include the Harmonie Club. The club was recognized as an historical property by the state of Michigan in 1975, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and was recognized by the city of Detroit in 1988.
